Russian missile attack on hotel in Kryvyi Rih kills 2, injures 14	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russian forces struck a hotel in Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast with a missile on March 5, killing two people and injuring 14, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine reported. The missile struck the five-storey hotel around 10 p.m. local time, killing a 53-year-old man, as well as one other victim. No additional information was provided on the identities of the deceased. Seven of the injured victims are currently listed as being in serious condition, while other remain in moderate condition, Suspilne reported. Emergency crews are currently working on-scene to evacuate more people from the burning hotel. Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service said that there may be additional victims under the rubble. Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of President Volodymyr Zelensky, remains a frequent target of Russian missile attacks. With a population of about 660,000, it is the second-largest city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, located roughly 70 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of the nearest front line.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-on-hotel-in-kryvyi-rih-kills-2-injures-7/	2025-03-05T13:43:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-05_15-53-17.jpg
Macron open to extending France's nuclear protection to European allies amid threat from Russia	During a televised address to his nation on March 5, French President Emmanuel Macron said he was open to extending France&apos;s nuclear umbrella to protect European allies. &quot;I have decided to start strategic discussions on the defense of the entire continent with our nuclear weapons. The decision will depend on the heads and commanders-in-chief of European countries,&quot; Macron said. The remarks come amid ongoing Russian aggression on the European continent that extends beyond Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russia has been accused of waging a proxy war with Europe, having been alleged of numerous incidents of Russian sabotage on the continent. &quot;The threat from Russia extends to the whole of Europe,&quot; Macron said. &quot;This aggressiveness seems far away, but it is very close. Russia is interfering in our elections, spreading propaganda everywhere.&quot; France and the United Kingdom are the only two European nations that possess a nuclear arsenal. Macron added that a final decision on the matter would ultimately rest with the French president. Macron further called for European allies to increase spending on defense, amid concerns that the United States may not come to Europe&apos;s defense if it is attacked by Russia. &quot;I want to believe that the U.S. will stand by our side, but we have to be ready for that not to be the case,&quot; Macron said, emphasizing that Russia continues to amass a larger military presence. &quot;Russia continues to rearm, it spends 40% of its budget on defense. By 2030, Russia wants to mobilize another three million soldiers and add four thousand tanks to its arsenal.&quot; Western leaders and defense officials previously warned about the threat emanating from Russia amid Europe&apos;s current lack of military preparedness. Western intelligence agencies have also warned that Russia may find the opportunity to launch a large-scale war on Europe within five years. &quot;Russia has become a threat for France and Europe,&quot; Macron said. &quot;(T)o watch and do nothing would be madness.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-open-to-extending-frances-nuclear-umbrella-to-european-allies-amid-threats-from-russia/	2025-03-05T13:06:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/gettyimages-2202893246-612x612.jpg
How US right-wing podcasters shape pro-Russia, anti-Ukraine sentiments	Listening to right-leaning alternative media in the U.S., one might come away with the impression &#x2014; albeit without evidence &#x2014; that Ukraine is irredeemably corrupt, President Volodymyr Zelensky is a dictator, and Russia&#x2019;s invasion was somehow justified. On a December episode of comedian Tim Dillon&#x2019;s podcast, podcaster Joe Rogan asserted that &#x201C;most people don&#x2019;t even know about the coup in 2014 in Ukraine,&#x201D; echoing a Russian talking point that casts the country&#x2019;s revolution against a pro-Russian corrupt regime in 2013-2014 as a U.S.-backed plot. &#x201C;Most people don&#x2019;t know that the president of the Ukraine right now, Zelensky, played the president on a television show &#x2014; a comedy show. And the premise of the comedy show was that a comedian becomes the president,&#x201D; Dillon added. While true in part, Dillon misrepresented Zelensky&#x2019;s role in &#x201C;Servant of the People,&#x201D; where he played a schoolteacher turned president, not a comedian. Dillon&#x2019;s use of &#x201C;the Ukraine,&#x201D; a linguistic relic of Soviet-era dominance, underscored how even casual conversations can echo geopolitical biases. After the onset of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war in 2022, negative and misleading narratives about Ukraine have gained momentum in right-leaning U.S. alternative media. As traditional news consumption reaches historic lows, a new frontier of media consumption has taken the lead. Right-wing alternative media has been particularly successful in the U.S. because &#x201C;it fills a void that mainstream media left open. It offers a clear, emotionally compelling, and often conspiratorial narrative that gives its audience easy explanations for complex problems,&#x201D; David Packman, an American talk show host and progressive political commentator, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Progressive media is up against a serious disadvantage which is that the truth is often way less exciting than a lie.&#x201D; During his 2024 election campaign, U.S. President Donald Trump aggressively courted influential right-leaning podcast hosts, harnessing their reach to millions of listeners for his political benefit. Some of these media figures &#x2014; including Rogan, Tucker Carlson, Patrick Bet-David, and Lex Fridman &#x2014; have also repeatedly amplified Russian narratives about Ukraine. With the U.S. suspending military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine in early March and the Trump administration&#x2019;s intensifying attacks on Zelensky, policy debates in the U.S. over the war and Ukraine&#x2019;s future appear to be shaped less by experts and more by Russian propaganda narratives, amplified by U.S. right-wing podcasters. Rogan&#x2019;s podcast, with over 19 million YouTube subscribers and a consistent hold on the top of the charts, dominates the alternative media sphere in the U.S. What began as a casual hangout for comedians has evolved over the past 16 years into a platform featuring high-profile guests like Silicon Valley tech moguls and presidential candidates. While he positions himself as &#x201C;an American first&#x201D; &#x2014; appearing to imply that patriotism is separate from political party allegiance &#x2014; &#xA0;Rogan has, in recent years, slowly embraced right-wing talking points. Rogan officially endorsed Trump during the 2024 presidential election and declared, &#x201C;Why would anyone be against (his desire to make America first)?&#x201D; in a recent episode with businessman Marc Andreessen. &#x201C;There&apos;s always been a very strong isolationist, &#x2018;America First&#x2019; constituency in the U.S. You will always be able to sell commercial media programming by waving the flag and asking why foreign aid is being sent abroad rather than paying for local or state needs,&#x201D; Professor Michael Socolow, an American media historian, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;(President Franklin D.) Roosevelt had to fight (isolationism) when trying to stop the Nazis before the Japanese bombed America into World War II. It seems like the anti-Ukraine discourse has blended into this traditional American political faction.&quot; Rogan has also voiced strong opposition to U.S. aid to Ukraine. In one episode, while talking to record producer and songwriter Scott Storch, Rogan condemned then-U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s authorization of Ukrainian strikes on Russian soil with American weapons, unleashing expletives aimed at Zelensky. &#x201C;How are you allowed to do that when you are on your way out? Like people don&#x2019;t want you to be there anymore, maybe that would be a good thing we would like to avoid from a dying former president. The whole thing is nuts,&#x201D; Rogan said. &quot;Zelensky says Putin is terrified. F**k you, man. You f**king people are about to start World War III.&#x201D; U.S. podcaster Joe Rogan greets then-U.S. President-elect Donald Trump during the UFC 309 event at Madison Square Garden in New York, New York, U.S. on Nov. 16, 2024. (Jeff Bottari / Zuffa LLC)During the heated Feb. 28 meeting in Washington, Trump made a similar point when he warned Zelensky he was &quot;gambling with World War III,&quot; suggesting that Ukraine&#x2019;s resistance to Russian aggression was a greater threat to global stability than Russia&apos;s invasion itself. Rogan later revealed that he turned down Zelensky&#x2019;s offer to appear on the podcast to share the Ukrainian perspective, offering little more than a casual dismissal during an episode with three other comedians: &#x201C;Zelensky tried to come on. They tried to get Zelensky on. I was like, &#x2018;What are you talking about?&#x2019;&#x201D; In the same episode where Rogan rejected the idea of interviewing Zelensky, fellow comedian Ari Shaffir casually mentioned that Former Fox News host and conspiracy theorist Tucker Carlson had told him that former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had &#x201C;prevented&#x201D; a 2022 peace deal &#x2014; a Kremlin narrative that ignores the fact that Russia-Ukraine negotiations stalled shortly after the discovery of the Bucha massacre. Both Johnson and Zelensky have also denied the claim. &#x201C;Where&#x2019;s the evidence (of Johnson intervening)? What&#x2019;s the context? Who are the sources? Doesn&#x2019;t matter &#x2014; once it&#x2019;s said on a massive platform, it becomes the truth,&#x201D; Packman said. &#x201C;And because these hosts are seen as more &#x2018;authentic&#x2019; than traditional news anchors, their words carry weight, even when they&apos;re just speculating or repeating Kremlin talking points without realizing it.&#x201D; Some of the anti-Ukraine messaging pushed by Rogan and other alternative media personalities can often be traced back to their guests, some of whom not only repeat pro-Russian narratives but have also interacted directly with the Kremlin. Among them is U.S. filmmaker Oliver Stone, who conducted over a dozen interviews with Vladimir Putin during the two years of filming a documentary about the Russian leader. Stone&#x2019;s other documentary, &#x201C;Ukraine on Fire,&#x201D; depicts the 2013-2014 EuroMaidan Revolution (or Revolution of Dignity) as &#x201C;the Maidan Massacre&#x201D; that resulted in the overthrow of then-President Viktor Yanukovych rather than a democratic uprising against Yanukovych&#x2019;s push to develop closer ties with Russia over the EU. In a 2022 interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, whose YouTube channel has nearly five million subscribers, Stone dismissed those who said that Putin was a &#x201C;madman&#x201D; for his invasion of Ukraine. &#x201C;What people don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201D; Stone argued, &#x201C;is that Ukraine has been a terrorist state since 2014&#x201D; &#x2013; another Kremlin talking point that has nothing to do with reality. Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has appeared on Rogan and Fridman&#x2019;s podcasts, has used X, formerly known as Twitter, to repeatedly amplify Russian talking points. He has also referred to the EuroMaidan Revolution as a coup and called for Ukraine&#x2019;s Crimean Peninsula &#x2013; occupied by Russia since 2014 &#x2013; to remain with Russia, which garnered him praise from former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Carlson, who has also interviewed Putin as well as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, has been a guest on a number of these shows or featured some of the hosts on his own show.

(Gavriil Grigorov / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;I do feel for Zelensky, I do&#x2026;I think Zelensky&#x2019;s been completely misused by the State Department&#x2026;by the policy makers in the U.S. who have used Ukraine as a vessel for their geopolitical ambitions,&#x201D; Carlson told Fridman shortly after his interview with Putin, reinforcing the narrative that Ukraine&#x2019;s push for independence is not truly its own. Additionally, Carlson has repeatedly claimed &#x2014; without evidence &#x2014; that Ukraine is selling U.S.-supplied weapons on the black market, including to Mexican drug cartels. Fellow right-wing commentator Richard Hanania privately asked Carlson for proof behind his claim, to which Carlson responded with a slew of personal insults, Hanania revealed in a March 2 post on X. When pressed on Carlson&#x2019;s pro-Russia rhetoric in an interview with Piers Morgan in early February, Zelensky didn&#x2019;t mince words: &#x201C;He needs to stop working for Putin, to stop kissing his ass, honestly.&#x201D; In addition to those who have traveled to Moscow for sit-downs with Putin, some podcasters have also been accused of receiving money directly from the Kremlin. In September 2024, the U.S. Justice Department alleged that several right-wing podcasters, including Tim Pool and Dave Rubin, were linked to Tenet Media, a company serving as a Russian intelligence services fronta front for Russian intelligence ser after Russia Today&#x2019;s reach was restricted. The podcasters were allegedly unaware of the company&#x2019;s ties to Russia and denied that the Kremlin had any influence over their work. However, some of them continue to push anti-Ukraine talking points to this day. &#x201C;I f**king despise these smarmy hypocrites defending Ukraine and Zelensky,&#x201D; Pool wrote on X on March 4. &#x201C;Ukraine has given us NOTHING. There is no reason to be involved in this war.&#x201D; Given these alternative media figures&#x2019; ties to Trump&#x2019;s political orbit, Zelensky has attempted to navigate &#x2014; and capitalize on &#x2014; this alternative media landscape to his country&#x2019;s benefit. While Zelensky didn&#x2019;t appear on Rogan&#x2019;s podcast and talks of an interview with Carlson never materialized, he sat down in January for a nearly three-hour conversation with Fridman. During the discussion, Zelensky fervently detailed Ukraine&#x2019;s struggles in an existential war and why negotiating with Putin isn&#x2019;t as straightforward as some suggest. While Fridman has publicly praised Zelensky as a hero, likening him to Winston Churchill, he steered their conversation in a different direction during the interview by speaking of the need for compromises and even to forgive Putin, prompting Zelensky to reply that the compromise was that Putin will likely never face the prison sentence he deserves &#x2014; but forgiveness, after everything, is out of the question. Following the interview, Fridman said on Rogan&#x2019;s podcast that he intends to travel to Moscow for an interview with Putin. Some other Ukrainian political figures, for personal gain, have also attempted to exploit the opportunities presented by this right-wing alternative media landscape.

(Lex Fridman / YouTube)At the end of December, Oleksiy Arestovych, a controversial former adviser to the President&#x2019;s Office, made an appearance on Iranian-American entrepreneur Patrick Bet-David&#x2019;s podcast. Bet-David hosted Trump and several of his immediate family members on his show during the presidential election. Arestovych cast himself to Bet-David&#x2019;s audience as a &#x201C;phenomenally popular&#x201D; figure forced to leave Ukraine at the warning of an unnamed U.S. official but resolute in his ambition to return when conditions permitted. Arestovych is known for exaggerating and even lying about his role in wartime Ukraine. None of Arestovych&#x2019;s statements were challenged by Bet-David during the three-hour-long interview &#x2014; every claim was presented and, in turn, accepted as fact. &#x201C;There are very few critical or antagonistic interviewers on podcasts,&#x201D; Socolow explained. &#x201C;That&apos;s how Trump used them so effectively during the campaign, for example. He knew he would be treated nicely, and that made it easier to promote his anti-Ukraine (and supposedly &#x2018;pro-America&#x2019;) messages.&#x201D; Amid declining U.S. popular support for Ukraine, Arestovych also sought to undermine confidence in Zelensky&apos;s leadership both domestically and internationally with provocative statements like &#x201C;I trust Putin more than Zelensky.&#x201D; Bet-David, known for frequently discussing alongside his co-hosts how Ukraine is &#x201C;totally corrupt,&#x201D; then pressed Arestovych to answer whether Zelensky had profited financially from the war. &#x201C;This is a very important question for you to answer,&#x201D; Bet-David said. &#x201C;If you answer it, in a way, it&#x2019;s catastrophic for (Zelensky). Do you know the answer, whether money ended up flowing to him through shell accounts or other people?&#x201D; Former President&apos;s Office advisor Oleksiy Arestovych at a forum in Kyiv on Dec. 11, 2020. (Evgen Kotenko/ Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images)&#x201C;I do not have information that he received money from corruption scandals. But I can tell you for sure that the level of corruption is off the charts. It&#x2019;s catastrophic,&#x201D; Arestovych replied vaguely, adding that &#x201C;at a minimum, it benefits the people who are surrounding (Zelensky).&#x201D; Bet-David has increasingly pushed anti-Ukraine rhetoric through conversations with a number of guests that have no apparent expertise on the issue. In a March 4 interview, men&apos;s rights activist and alleged human trafficker Andrew Tate joined Bet-David in accusing Zelensky of the &#x201C;audacity&#x201D; of &quot;disrespecting&quot; Trump during his White House visit. Bet-David and Tate also implied that Zelensky is somehow prolonging the war out of personal interests, despite the Kremlin saying publicly that they have yet to achieve their objectives in Ukraine &#x2014; namely, the destruction of Ukrainian statehood. Polls show that right-wing alternative media&#x2019;s anti-Ukraine rhetoric has resonated among a significant percentage of the American public. As the full-scale war entered its fourth year, that lack of support could prove deadly. Pew Research published a poll in November that showed 43% of Republicans believed that the U.S. was providing too much aid to Ukraine, and only 36% said the country had a responsibility to help defend Ukraine. Likewise, a Gallup poll from December showed that 50% of Americans believe in the need for a swift end to the war even if it means Ukraine doesn&#x2019;t recover all of its territory under Russian occupation. &#x201C;What appears to be happening is that the fringe media is influencing the more-established and respectable conservative media mindset,&#x201D; Socolow said. &#x201C;And this is shaping anti-Ukraine, pro-Putin rhetoric that&apos;s becoming more influential.&quot; Thanks for reading this article. As an American who has lived for a long time in Ukraine, it&#x2019;s important for me to call out those back in my birth country who are spreading harmful disinformation about the country that holds a special place in my heart. During wartime, it is even more important to get facts straight.

Ukraine war latest: US halts intelligence sharing with Ukraine, CIA director confirms	Key developments on March 5: The U.S. has halted intelligence sharing with Kyiv, threatening Ukraine&apos;s ability to strike Russian targets amid the full-scale war, CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed to Fox Business on March 5. &#x201C;Trump had a real question about whether President (Volodymyr) Zelensky was committed to the peace process, and he said let&#x2019;s pause,&#x201D; Ratcliffe said. On March 5, the Financial Times reported, citing undisclosed sources, that the U.S. had halted intelligence sharing with Ukraine. The move follows Washington&apos;s decision to freeze all military aid supplies to Ukraine following a public spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump. The decision was likely intended to put pressure on Zelensky in peace talks. Zelensky later issued a statement on March 4 in which he called the Oval Office clash &quot;regrettable&quot; and affirmed commitment to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s leadership. The U.S. president praised Zelensky&#x2019;s statement in his address to Congress but made no direct comment on releasing military aid. &#x201C;I think on the military front and the intelligence front, the pause that allowed that to happen, I think will go away,&#x201D; Ratcliffe added. There had been conflicting claims as to whether the aid freeze also concerned intelligence sharing, a crucial capability that allows Ukraine to strike Russian targets and track military movement. Citing an undisclosed Ukrainian official, Bloomberg originally disputed the Financial Times&apos; article, claiming that intelligence sharing is ongoing. The British tabloid Daily Mail previously reported that the U.S. banned the U.K. from sharing Washington-obtained intelligence with Kyiv. Two officials told the FT that while Washington blocked allies from sharing U.S. intelligence with Ukraine, &quot;recipients with assets inside the country&quot; are likely to continue passing certain information to Ukraine. The restrictions will nevertheless hamper time-sensitive intelligence crucial for conducting precision strikes against moveable Russian targets, according to the outlet. Sky News supported this claim, reporting that the restrictions are &quot;selective&quot; and are aimed at Ukraine&apos;s ability to launch strikes. Since then, the U.S. media has reported that the aid freeze remains in place and that it is unclear whether Zelensky&apos;s statement that the Oval Office clash was &quot;regrettable&quot; was sufficient to lift the freeze. The Oval Office spat on Feb. 28, after which the U.S. leaders berated Zelensky as &quot;ungrateful&quot; and not &quot;ready for peace,&quot; derailed the signing of a much-anticipated natural resources agreement between the two countries. Ukraine&apos;s leader reaffirmed his readiness to sign the deal in his statement on March 4, but CBS News reported that parameters are still unclear as Trump seeks better terms. U.S. President Donald Trump may lift the pause on military support for Ukraine once peace talks are arranged and more confidence-building measures are taken, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said on March 5, according to Reuters. White House officials signaled that Zelensky must issue an apology and demonstrate readiness for peace to get the talks back on track. On March 4, the Ukrainian president made a statement in which he called the quarrel &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his commitment to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Waltz called the statement a &quot;good, positive first step.&quot; Similarly, Trump voiced appreciation for Zelensky&apos;s words and mentioned the statement in his address to Congress. &quot;I think if we can nail down these negotiations and move towards these negotiations, and in fact, put some confidence-building measures on the table, then the president will take a hard look at lifting this pause,&quot; Waltz said on the Fox &amp; Friends program, according to Reuters. According to Trump&apos;s aide, officials are leading talks on a specific date, location, and team for the negotiations. Ukraine has repeatedly stressed that security guarantees that would prevent Russia from resuming its aggression at a later date are a necessary condition for any peace talks. The Trump administration has retorted that the minerals deal is a security commitment of its own and pushed to broker a quick resolution between Kyiv and Moscow. Zelensky reaffirmed his readiness to sign the deal in his statement on March 4, but CBS News reported that parameters are still unclear as Trump seeks better terms. Ukraine and Europe are working on a plan for the first steps toward a just and sustainable peace as Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion enters its fourth year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 5. &quot;We are preparing a plan of first steps to bring about a just and sustainable peace. We are working on it quickly. It will be ready soon,&quot; he wrote on Telegram. Zelensky will participate in a special European Council meeting on March 6, where EU leaders are expected to discuss continued support for Ukraine as well as security guarantees for a lasting peace. The president said in his Telegram post that he had discussed the plan with with Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob, briefing him on the recent leaders&apos; summit in London and joint European efforts. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosted a summit on March 2, gathering key Western leaders, including Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, to coordinate support for Ukraine. Zelensky wrote on Telegram that Europe has a common vision for ending Russia&apos;s war and securing long-term stability. &quot;It should be at the table of future negotiations together with Ukraine and the United States,&quot; he added. The statement comes as U.S. and Russian officials held talks in Istanbul on Feb. 27, following their initial meeting in Riyadh on Feb. 18. The discussions, part of U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s push for a swift peace deal, have raised concerns in Kyiv and Europe that Washington is sidelining its allies. Zelensky&apos;s remarks follow a dramatic shift in U.S. foreign policy, with Trump echoing Kremlin narratives and accusing the Ukrainian president of prolonging the war. Washington has frozen all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, a move widely seen as an attempt to pressure Kyiv into talks with Russia. Earlier, the Ukrainian president proposed initial steps toward peace, including releasing prisoners and a ceasefire in the air and sea. Ukrainian and American delegations will meet &quot;soon&quot; for peace talks, President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said on March 5, following discussions with U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. &quot;We discussed further steps towards a just and lasting peace,&quot; he wrote on Telegram. The two sides &quot;also exchanged views on security issues and the coordination of positions within the framework of bilateral relations between Ukraine and the United States,&quot; Yermak said, adding the teams agreed to meet in the near future to &quot;continue this important work.&quot; In his evening address, Zelensky said that the first results of the ongoing negotiations would be announced next week. &quot;Everyone can see how fast diplomatic events are developing. Today, our Ukrainian and U.S. teams have started working on a meeting. There is a positive movement,&quot; Zelensky said. An agreement between Kyiv and Washington on the natural resources remains stalled as Trump seeks a &quot;bigger, better deal,&quot; CBS News reported on March 4. White House officials publicly indicated that Zelensky must issue an apology and demonstrate a commitment to peace talks for discussions to resume. On March 4, Zelensky called the White House clash &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his willingness to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Waltz suggested on March 5 that Trump may lift the pause on military assistance once peace talks are arranged and more confidence-building measures are taken, Reuters reported. The long-debated agreement would establish a fund to which Ukraine would contribute 50% of proceeds from the future monetization of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. Ukraine previously rejected two U.S. proposals due to the absence of security guarantees, but negotiations are continuing amid mounting pressure from Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump said he appreciated President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s statement in support of peace talks but did not directly discuss his decision to halt military aid to Ukraine in his address to a joint session of Congress on March 4. Multiple news outlets reported on March 3 that the Trump administration ordered an immediate freeze on all U.S. military aid to Ukraine. The U.S. president barely referenced the decision in his first major address to lawmakers since returning to the White House, focusing largely on domestic issues. When he mentioned the war and Washington&apos;s role in supporting Ukraine, he avoided any direct mention of the aid freeze. &quot;The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine&apos;s defense,&quot; Trump said. &quot;With no security, with no anything. Do you want to keep it going for another five years?&quot; That question was Trump&apos;s only nod to the suspension of aid, which a White House official said on March 4 is meant to pressure &#xA0;President Volodymyr Zelensky into peace negotiations. Trump said in his address that he &quot;appreciate(s)&quot; Zelensky&apos;s recent statements expressing Ukraine&apos;s readiness for peace, but did not say whether or not the U.S. would resume weapons deliveries. On March 4, Zelensky reiterated Ukraine&apos;s commitment to the peace process in a post on X. &quot;Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians,&quot; &#xA0;he wrote. Zelensky proposed initial steps toward de-escalation with Russia, including prisoner of war (POW) releases, a &quot;truce at sea,&quot; and a &quot;truce in the sky&quot; that would ban missiles, long-range drones, and bombs targeting civilian infrastructure. He also said Ukraine is ready to sign the critical minerals deal &quot;at any time and in any convenient format.&quot; Trump said in his address to Congress that he received that same message in a letter from Zelensky. He read Zelensky&apos;s statement aloud, apparently presenting the message as a sign of successful U.S. pressure on Kyiv. Trump added that his team had held discussions with Russia and received &quot;strong signals&quot; that Moscow is ready to make peace. &quot;Wouldn&apos;t that be beautiful?&quot; he said. While Trump&apos;s remarks on Ukraine and Russia were short on details, his comments indicated that he wants Europe to foot the bill for Ukraine&apos;s defense. &quot;Europe has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending Ukraine,&quot; he said. Trump likened U.S. spending on military aid to Ukraine to &quot;taking candy from a baby&quot; and expressed disbelief at the disparity between European and American aid packages. He repeated his hopes for an end to the war, saying, &quot;It&apos;s time for the madness to stop,&quot; but made no mention of sanctions against Russia or security guarantees for Ukraine. Drones of the Ukrainian Hart Brigade&apos;s Falcon unit destroyed a Russian Murom-M long-range surveillance system near the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces said on March 5. Vovchansk is an embattled town some 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Kharkiv that has seen heavy battles since Russia launched a new offensive in the area in May 2024. Russian forces &quot;were not saved by the anti-drone net that covered it (Murom-M) from all sides.

France, UK to finalize peace plan with Ukraine 'in days,' set to present to US, Reuters reports	France and the U.K. aim to finalize a peace plan with Ukraine &quot;in days&quot; to present to the United States, Reuters reported on March 6, citing diplomatic sources familiar with the matter. The report follows President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s statement that Ukraine and Europe are working on the first steps toward a just and sustainable peace as Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion enters its fourth year. &quot;We&apos;re looking at putting this plan together in days and not weeks,&quot; a senior European diplomat told Reuters. Another diplomatic source told Reuters that the main goal is to align European and Ukrainian positions before presenting the proposal to the U.S. while reinforcing the message that Russia is the aggressor. European leaders met in London on March 2 to discuss pathways to ending the war and restoring dialogue between Ukraine and the U.S. following the heated Feb. 28 exchange between Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump. Washington has since frozen all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, widely seen as an attempt to pressure Kyiv into talks with Russia. The move comes amid a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy, with Trump echoing Kremlin narratives and accusing Zelensky of prolonging the war. The Daily Mail claimed that Macron, Starmer, and Zelensky were planning a joint visit to Washington to present a &quot;united front&quot; to Trump. Le Figaro later reported that French officials quickly rebuked the speculation, with the Elysee Palace saying that no such visit is planned &quot;at this stage.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/france-uk-to-finalize-peace-plan-with-ukraine-in-days-set-to-present-to-us-reuters-reports/	2025-03-05T11:58:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202214106.jpg
Trump's alignment with Russia derails Europe's push for a peacekeeping force in Ukraine	European countries have intensified talks on sending peacekeepers to Ukraine to monitor and enforce a possible ceasefire. But the potential deployment of European peacekeepers to Ukraine faces a lot of challenges and uncertainties. There is no unity among European countries on the issue, with some of them openly opposing the idea. The number of peacekeepers is also uncertain, and it is not clear if it will be enough to ensure the effective enforcement of a ceasefire. And the rules of engagement may become a major stumbling block. Another concern is that the Kremlin has refused to accept the potential deployment of Western peacekeepers in Ukraine. Without Russia&apos;s approval, the idea is unlikely to be implemented, and there are no indications so far that U.S. President Donald Trump will pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to approve a European peacekeeping mission. European countries have also said peacekeepers would need to have some form of U.S. support. However, it is unclear if Washington will provide it. Trump has aligned his policy closely with the Kremlin&apos;s agenda and has so far refused to offer any security guarantees to Ukraine. &quot;The deployment of a European military force to Ukraine is, in my view, the least likely form of security assistance to Ukraine because of the high risks involved, and notably the requirement that the United States provides security guarantees to the force &#x2014; essentially Washington being ready to fight Russia,&quot; Neil Melvin, director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;President Trump and representatives of his administration have repeatedly stated that the US will not provide such commitments.&quot; Jenny Mathers, a lecturer in international politics at the U.K.&apos;s Aberystwyth University, also argued that &quot;Trump and (U.S. Vice President JD) Vance made it clear just how little they are interested in the security of Ukraine or indeed of Europe.&quot; &quot;European leaders &#x2014; and probably societies too &#x2014; are accepting that Europe will need to take the lead when it comes to security guarantees.&quot; Talks on the potential peacekeeping mission have been spearheaded by the U.K. and France. Ireland, Lithuania, and Canada have also stated that they are considering sending their peacekeepers to Ukraine. &quot;The force would be led by the U.K. and France but would be most likely supported by Sweden, possibly also Poland and the Baltic states or Spain, Italy or the Netherlands, and Denmark,&quot; Pavel Havlicek, a research fellow at the Association for International Affairs, told the Kyiv Independent. But several countries, including some of those named by Havlicek, have been opposed to the idea or non-committal.

(Aline Deschamps/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)Germany has taken an ambivalent stance. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said in January that Berlin might consider deploying its troops in a peacekeeping mission to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. Chancellor Olaf Scholz from the Social Democratic Party contradicted Pistorius in February, saying that discussions over Germany potentially deploying its peacekeeping troops to Ukraine were &quot;premature and inappropriate.&quot; The CDU/CSU alliance, which won Germany&apos;s Feb. 23 parliamentary election, appears to be more open to the idea. Its leader, Friedrich Merz, who is expected to become the next chancellor, said in December that Germany may consider joining a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine but only with Russia&apos;s consent. &quot;For my country, Germany, it is a test on our reliability in a possible new European security architecture,&quot; Rebecca Harms, a former member of the European Parliament from Germany, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;And if we put its participation in a historical context, I see that for the Germans, it would be the chance to pay off our horrendous historical guilt in Ukraine,&quot; she added in reference to Nazi Germany&apos;s occupation of Ukraine during World War II and the Holocaust. Meanwhile, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said in December that Warsaw was not planning to deploy peacekeepers to Ukraine. &quot;(Some countries) are hesitant &#x2014; like Italy, Spain, and Germany &#x2014; as they see that this could be a potentially dangerous mission, especially if the United States continues to refuse to provide a backstop,&quot; James Shea, a defense and security expert at Chatham House, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Others like the Baltic states and Poland are worried that the troops going to Ukraine would come from the NATO battalions currently defending their national territory and leaving them more vulnerable to Russia.&quot; If a peacekeeping force is created, it might include troops from non-EU countries as well. Turkey has indicated its openness to deploying troops in Ukraine as part of a potential peacekeeping force, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 27, citing sources familiar with the matter. Shea said that &quot;Russia will probably advocate this option (of non-European troops) as it would like the force to be &apos;neutral&apos; and similar to a lightly armed UN peacekeeping force, observing the ceasefire rather than with a mandate to enforce it and help Ukraine to defend itself.&quot; &quot;The Europeans need to work hard with the Americans to ensure that they resist Putin&apos;s demands and go for a robust European-led force,&quot; he added. Havlicek said that &quot;from the Western point of view, Turkish soldiers would be preferred, and Chinese or Central Asian ones would be (preferred) from the Russian one.&quot; At least 200,000 peacekeepers would be required on Ukraine&apos;s eastern front for a peace deal to be enforced, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January. Later, he clarified his comments. &quot;By the way, I didn&apos;t say we need 200,000 (peacekeepers)... A journalist asked me, I said, &apos;Maybe more, maybe less,&apos;&quot; Zelensky said. President Volodymyr Zelensky gives an interview to Turkish media after his visit to Ankara, T&#xFC;rkiye, on Feb. 19, 2024. (Mert Gokhankoc/dia images via Getty Images)The Washington Post reported in February, citing its sources, that participating European nations could send between 25,000 and 30,000 soldiers to Ukraine. &quot;President Zelensky has spoken of the need for a force of hundreds of thousands,&quot; Melvin said. &quot;This is unrealistic. It might just be possible to put together a force of up to 30,000 &#x2013; although whether that could be sustained for long is unclear.&quot; Havlicek said that &quot;around 30,000 to 50,000 troops are often discussed, and they would not be placed at the front line but in several key points where it would be possible to step in if necessary.&quot; It is unclear if such a number will be enough. Harms argued that, given the length of the front line, 100,000 would be needed to effectively monitor the ceasefire. Another problem is that the Kremlin has opposed the potential deployment of Western peacekeepers to Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned in February that Moscow would not accept the deployment of NATO military personnel in Ukraine after any potential peace deal. Melvin said that &quot;this is likely to be a major roadblock to a peace agreement.&quot; But analysts say that the West may try to change the Kremlin&apos;s position. Havlicek argued that &quot;the Kremlin refuses the Western/NATO countries&apos; deployment right now&quot; but &quot;we are only at the beginning of the negotiation process, with many unknowns.&quot; &quot;Economic pressure, including on the energy (sector), could serve as a means to pressure Putin into negotiations,&quot; he added. A European diplomatic source told the Kyiv Independent that, to force Putin to accept a European peacekeeping force, the West should threaten to impose more painful sanctions on Russia&apos;s banking system. The source also said that the West could threaten Russia with sanctions as punishment for violating a ceasefire agreement. The big question is whether Trump will be capable of pressuring Putin or willing to do so. &quot;Trump appears to have no leverage with Putin whatsoever &#x2014; indeed, it looks just the opposite,&quot; Mathers said. &quot;So far, we have seen Trump and his senior officials echoing Kremlin&apos;s talking points and showing how eager they are to re-establish diplomatic and trading relations with Russia without asking Russia to make any concessions at all.&quot; If Russia agrees to a European military presence in Ukraine, the deployment of peacekeepers would still involve considerable risks. &quot;These troops would be under constant risk and potential fire, which is why it is so important to provide U.S. support and guarantees,&quot; Havlicek said. The troops should be there not to fight, but to provide security for the ceasefire and build trust, including ensuring that the conflict does not escalate into a bigger war if Russia resumes military hostilities.&quot; The effectiveness of the potential peacekeeping force also depends on the rules of engagement. &quot;A lot depends on the terms of any deal and the role for peacekeepers that is built in: what their terms of engagement would be,&quot; Mathers said. &quot;We have a situation in the 1990s where UN peacekeepers sent to Bosnia had very limited terms of engagement and ended up being largely ineffectual. We will see if today&apos;s political leaders have learned anything from that experience, or indeed if there is any institutional memory of it.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump chats with Russian President Vladimir Putin during the APEC Economic Leaders&apos; Meeting in Danang, Vietnam, on Nov. 11, 2017. (Mikhail Klimentyev/Sputnik/AFP via Getty Images)Shea argued that &quot;Putin would definitely like the return of the former OSCE observer mission, which proved ineffective at stopping the continuous ceasefire violations in the Donbas.&quot; The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) monitored the front line in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts from 2014 to 2022. Russia violated ceasefire agreements 25 times during the period, according to Zelensky. Shea also said that European peacekeepers would likely &quot;not be on the front line but guarding cities and infrastructure to the rear.&quot; &quot;So, how much fighting ability and deterrent effect they will have on Russia is open to question,&quot; he added. &quot;Especially if Russia doesn&apos;t withdraw its own forces and heavy weapons from forward positions.&quot; European countries have said that they needed a &quot;backstop&quot; from the U.S. for a peacekeeping force in Ukraine. They implied some kind of support or security guarantees but did not elaborate on the issue. Melvin argued that &quot;30,000 (European peacekeepers) would not be able to enforce a ceasefire on their own.&quot; &quot;Without a U.S. security guarantee &#x2014; and here there would be uncertainty about whether President Trump would respond to an attack on the European force even if he had made a previous commitment &#x2014; and given Russia&apos;s comments, there would be considerable risk that these troops would be targeted by Moscow in the future,&quot; he added. Shea said that Europeans could &quot;try to have the U.S. involved in other ways: for instance in supplying air defense assets, logistics and intelligence and allowing the NATO command structure (which depends heavily on U.S. military officers and infrastructure and communications) to provide the planning for the operation.&quot; &quot;Ideally, the U.S. could also provide a reserve or extraction force for the Europeans in a crisis situation, but this will probably be a big ask for Trump and the Pentagon,&quot; he added. &quot;Having the U.S. involved in some way will increase the chances that European countries like Germany, Spain, or Italy, which are currently hesitating to contribute to the force, would do so in the future as U.S. troops on the ground will enhance the overall deterrence capability of the force.&quot; British KFOR soldiers take part in a wreath-laying ceremony for Remembrance Sunday in Pristina, Kosovo, on Nov. 10, 2024. (Armend Nimani/AFP via Getty Images)Mathers said that the Europeans &quot;want the U.S. to commit to retaliating against Russia using American forces (probably air capabilities) if Russia breaks any ceasefire or peace deal.&quot; &quot;They want an Article 5 assurance that an attack by Russia on European troops in Ukraine will be regarded by Washington as an attack on the U.S. and respond accordingly,&quot; she added. &quot;I doubt they will get this, given Trump&apos;s increasingly pro-Russia line, but they might get, for example, an agreement to have U.S. aircraft stationed nearby, patrolling the skies over Ukraine, or something of that nature. Even that, though, would be a stretch for Trump, I suspect.&quot; Kyiv Independent reporter Asami Terajima contributed to this article.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-alignment-with-russia-derails-europes-push-for-a-peacekeeping-force-in-ukraine/	2025-03-05T11:40:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2148296359.jpg
Trump lifting US sanctions on Russia — a ‘huge win’ for Putin, ‘chaos’ for global economy	U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s administration is reportedly ready to lift sanctions on Russia imposed after the start of the full-scale invasion, in a reversal of U.S. policy toward Moscow during its war against Ukraine. The White House is preparing a plan to potentially give Russia sanctions relief for several entities and Russian citizens as part of negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported on March 3. The move is a stark shift from a sanctions policy by former President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration that included the &#x201C;mother of all sanctions,&#x201D; Europe and the G7 nations want to keep sanctions to throttle Russia&#x2019;s economy and continue to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin. They may have no other option than to follow Washington to maintain unity among Ukraine&#x2019;s allies and avoid being a pariah in the global economy. &#x201C;The big revenue raising opportunities for Russia are still linked to business connected with Europe, and Europe can stand fast on that. But very quickly Europe would find itself marginalized,&#x201D; said Tom Keatinge, director of the Center for Finance and Security at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a think tank. Although the effectiveness of sanctions has been debated, they have clearly gotten under the skin of Putin, who has repeatedly called for their end. Sanctions, particularly on the oil and gas industry, have been a headache for Moscow, forcing it to resort to a shadow fleet to sell discounted fuel while incurring higher export costs. So far, Europe has not said if it will keep sanctions in place or not. Kyiv&#x2019;s sanctions commissioner, Vladyslav Vlasiuk, called on European allies to commit to sanctions &#x201C;for as long as necessary.&#x201D; If the U.S. unilaterally lifts sanctions, it would be a huge win for Putin and a further sign that the Western alliance is crumbling amid already heightened tensions, Keatinge told the Kyiv Independent. The idea of sanctions was for Ukraine&#x2019;s allies to work together to hinder Russia&#x2019;s war economy and punish Moscow for its brutal invasion. Trump&#x2019;s administration previously floated sanctions relief to bring Moscow to the negotiation table, shortly after former president Joe Biden worked with London to lay down the most extensive sanctions to date in January before Trump&#x2019;s inauguration. The growing rift between the U.S. and Europe has increased the risk of Trump acting without Europe. He no longer sees the need to coordinate with European allies and seems uninterested in keeping sanctions in place, said Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council&apos;s Transatlantic Security Initiative. The fallout from the U.S. unilaterally easing sanctions would cause chaos in the global economy, she said. Companies would have to navigate the complexities of conforming to one set of rules for the U.S. and another for the remaining G7 and EU economies, leading to mountains of paperwork and uncertainty among businesses. &#x201C;We have never been in a situation before where one Western ally might act in one way in lifting sanctions and others may act in a different way,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Imagine the chaos that would create for companies if within the G7 and the European Union we had essentially contradictory rules when it comes to Russia.&#x201D; The U.S. and Russia were never important trading partners, with pre-war trade totaling $6.4 billion in Russian imports and $29.7 billion in American exports in 2021. In purely economic terms, lifting American sanctions wouldn&#x2019;t lead to massive amounts of cash flowing to Russia&#x2019;s war machine, but the political messaging would be &#x201C;catastrophic,&#x201D; said Jason McCue, senior partner of McCue Jury &amp; Partners LLP, a law firm. Vladimir Putin walks past an honour guard at the Kremlin in Moscow on July 31, 2024. (Maxim Shemetov / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)The disunity among Ukraine&#x2019;s allies would not only be a gift for Russia but would make sanctions harder to sustain. The EU and G7 have already sanctioned &#x201C;everything that is meaningful,&#x201D; and further packages cannot counterbalance the loss of the U.S., said Braw. European countries will face the moral dilemma of easing sanctions to boost Europe&#x2019;s economy and keep up with American companies or sticking to their guns to punish Putin. Brussels and London would find it hard to lift restrictions as they stipulate that Russia should meet requirements such as compensating Kyiv and respecting Ukraine&#x2019;s territorial integrity. But pressure could mount from businesses and pro-Russian leaders like Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban that have long been against sanctions. &#xA0; &#x201C;There will be European corporations that will be trying to take a back channel to get licenses so that they can compete with Americans,&#x201D; said Keatinge. If the EU lifts sanctions, it would be a much bigger boost for Russia&#x2019;s economy. Moscow and Brussels were key trading partners pre-war, with trade reaching 257.5 billion euros in 2021, including over 60% of Russian fuel imports to the EU &#x2014; Russia&#x2019;s biggest cash cow. The question remains if Putin would allow European enterprises to enter Russia again. If the U.S. unilaterally eases sanctions, Putin will have the leverage to turn around and demand more from Europe in return for a place on its market, said Keatinge. &#x201C;That would be a huge victory for Putin because he would essentially be marginalizing Europe and doing business with the Americans,&#x201D; he said. Trump can lift some sanctions with a wave of his hand while others will have to go through Congress. With the U.S. leader embarking on his own negotiations with Russia, sanction relief will likely be a part of a deal cut with Moscow. Following a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov last month, Trump&#x2019;s administration vocally supported economic opportunities with Russia after the war. In particular, Trump has eyed Russia&#x2019;s lucrative mineral deposits, which previously made up a large chunk of Russian exports to the U.S. &#x201C;If sanctions were lifted, I suspect it would be more about making money for the United States, giving Putin something that he can talk about, and further wedging between the U.S. and the EU,&#x201D; said Keatinge. If Trump does negotiate easing sanctions on Russia, he needs to ensure security guarantees for Ukraine, said Yuliya Ziskina, a senior legal fellow at Razom for Ukraine, a nonprofit. Without them, it would be an &#x201C;ill-fated strategy,&#x201D; she said. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he departs the White House in Washington, DC, U.S. on Feb. 28, 2025. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)&#x201C;Lifting sanctions against Russia would allow it to rebuild its economy, strengthen its war machine, and reattack Ukraine,&#x201D; Ziskina told the Kyiv Independent. Trump is also likely to untie sanctions that would benefit U.S. businesses by arguing that they work against the interests of the U.S. population. In turn, that will bolster Russian businesses and allow them to get hold of dollars via the U.S., overcoming the suspension of U.S. dollar exchange trading on the Moscow Exchange, McCue said. While lifting sanctions would legally give American companies carte blanche to jump back into the Russian market, Moscow is still battling an overheated economy that will turn many off. The ruble&#x2019;s value may have bounced back in recent weeks in line with Trump&#x2019;s talks on a peace agreement, but the key interest rate remains sky-high at 21%, and growth is predicted to slow to 1.7% this year, down from 4.1% in 2024. U.S. Companies would also have to battle the lawlessness of Russia, which is dominated by cutthroat oligarchs close to Putin. Nationalization and corporate raids still loom over Western businesses operating in Russia, and that won&apos;t disappear anytime soon, said Ziskina. Many businesses will remain circumspect of the risks and potential global backlash, although some will cautiously wait to see what happens to the first tranche that barrels in, said Braw. &#x201C;But to be honest, the kinds of companies we&apos;re talking about are not worried about reputational risks,&#x201D; said Keatinge.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-lifting-us-sanctions-on-russia-a-huge-win-for-putin-chaos-for-global-economy/	2025-03-05T11:15:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203349192.jpg
Trump’s ‘America First’ strategy with Ukraine could backfire on US long term interests, experts warn	U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s escalating pressure on Ukraine over the past week has shocked the global community as he pushes for a quick end to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. The news on March 3 that the U.S. would suspend all military aid to Ukraine sparked fears in Ukraine and joy inside Russia that the U.S. was abandoning its long-standing ally and siding with Moscow. While a halt in aid could be calamitous for Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to defend itself against a full-scale invasion that has now carried on for more than three years, many experts believe the U.S. policies towards Ukraine may also cause long-term harm to the U.S.&#x2019;s own interests. &#x201C;Clearly, there will be different views on this,&quot; said Ian Lesser, a distinguished fellow of the German Marshall Fund and adviser to the president of the U.S.-based think tank. &quot;The Trump administration feels that it&#x2019;s vigorously pursuing an America First policy, and that as a matter of priority, they are looking to greatly reduce &#x2014; if not disengage from &#x2014; European security and to leave that responsibility to European allies,&quot; Lesser said. In a contentious televised meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, Trump said that Europe should be responsible for any security guarantees negotiated as part of a peace plan. Trump is pushing for Ukraine to sign a deal that would allow U.S. investors to profit from Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources, and has said it&#x2019;s &quot;not fair&quot; that the U.S. hasn&#x2019;t received compensation for the funds it has sent to Ukraine. According to Lesser, however, pivoting away from European defense is an &quot;ill-considered choice&quot; that would likely undermine American interests both in the near term and in the longer term. America&#x2019;s long-standing support for Europe has not been an act of charity, he points out, but a policy decision that the country benefits from. &quot;An insecure Europe has implications for the security of North America,&quot; he said. Additionally, signs of disengagement from the U.S. on international security issues will embolden adversaries beyond Europe, he said, citing the South China Sea as a potential example of where tensions could worsen. One of the immediate effects of Trump&#x2019;s latest moves has been a growing sense in Europe that it can no longer count on the U.S as a reliable ally. After the U.S. backed off on its support for Ukraine, the European Union announced a new plan to mobilize hundreds of billions of dollars and boost defense spending. &#x201C;Europe is ready to assume its responsibilities,&quot; said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on March 4. &quot;This is a moment for Europe and we are ready to step up.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and France&apos;s President Emmanuel Macron meet during a summit at Lancaster House in London, England, on March 2, 2025. (Justin Tallis / WPA Pool / Getty Images)A boost in defense spending is a positive signal for the region&#x2019;s security, and a move that Trump has long pushed for. Nevertheless, Trump&#x2019;s approach has meant it comes at the sharp cost of declining confidence in American leadership, said Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of Isolationism: A History of America&apos;s Efforts to Shield Itself From the World. Kupchan said that Trump&#x2019;s stated objective &#x2014; to end the war &#x2014; is the right goal, but that his strategy has been &quot;disastrous.&quot; In his negotiations, the U.S. president has insulted and sidelined allies, while upending longstanding U.S. policy by demanding severe concessions from Ukraine while appearing to placate Russia. &quot;If you&apos;re not just Ukraine, but if you&apos;re France, Germany, the U.K., South Korea, Japan, you have no choice but to ask yourself: Can I count on the United States? Is the United States now passing through a period of such profound political dysfunction that we have to make other plans?&quot; Kupchan said. &#x201C;I think the damage that is done to perceptions of the United States, to America&apos;s reputation for reliability and steadiness, is very harmful,&quot; he added. &apos;It undermines U.S. influence.&quot; A direct consequence of diminished U.S. influence is the weakening of the Western alliance that has kept America&#x2019;s adversaries in check. &quot;I think (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and (Chinese President) Xi (Jinping) are drinking a lot of champagne these days,&quot; Kupchan said. &quot;They don&#x2019;t have to lift a finger. They just sit back and watch Trump weaken the alliance of like-minded countries that has been the anchor of the international system since Pearl Harbor.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin and China&apos;s President Xi Jinping make a toast during a reception following their talks at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia on March 21, 2023. (Pavel Byrkin/AFP via Getty Images)George Barros, who heads the Russia Team and Geospatial Intelligence Team at the Institute for the Study of War, shared a similar view. &quot;Our adversaries are the ones that benefit the most from all these things,&quot; Barros said, referring to Trump&#x2019;s recent moves including the aid suspension. &quot;They&apos;re salivating at the prospect of the American-European transatlantic relationship imploding.&quot; After the announcement of the suspension of aid to Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov spoke positively of the decision, and Russian officials and propagandists rushed to defend Trump after his clash with Zelensky. Despite a March 4 statement from Zelensky in which he proposed steps toward peace and called the Oval Office exchange &quot;regrettable,&quot; the aid freeze remains in place. According to Barros, however, it is still too early to say whether the U.S. is abandoning its ties with Western allies and its role as a leader on the global stage. While he didn&#x2019;t rule it out, he said there is also a possibility that Trump is pursuing a different strategy that he hasn&#x2019;t articulated. Zelensky himself noted the lack of a &quot;clear position&quot; from U.S. officials after the aid suspension during his evening address on March 4, saying &quot;people should not be kept guessing.&quot; Overall, the aid suspension was a &quot;mistake,&quot; Barros said &#x2014; one he hoped would be reversed soon, though he sounded a note of caution. &quot;I think we&#x2019;re still going to see more gut punches in the coming weeks and months, most likely. It&#x2019;s very bad,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-america-first-strategy-with-ukraine-could-backfire-on-u-s-long-term-interests-experts-warn/	2025-03-05T11:10:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202564066.jpg
Ukraine, US delegations to meet 'soon' for negotiations, Zelensky's top aide says	Ukrainian and American delegations will meet &quot;soon&quot; for peace talks, President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said on March 5, following discussions with U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. &quot;We discussed further steps towards a just and lasting peace,&quot; he wrote on Telegram. The two sides &quot;also exchanged views on security issues and the coordination of positions within the framework of bilateral relations between Ukraine and the United States,&quot; Yermak said, adding the teams agreed to meet in the near future to &quot;continue this important work.&quot; In his evening address, Zelensky said that the first results of ongoing negotiations would be announced next week. &quot;Everyone can see how fast diplomatic events are developing. Today, our Ukrainian and U.S. teams have started working on a meeting. There is a positive movement,&quot; Zelensky said. The statements come amid rising tensions between Kyiv and Washington following a clash in the Oval Office exchange on Feb. 28 between Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump. The dispute led to the collapse of a bilateral deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, after which the U.S. president paused all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. An agreement between Kyiv and Washington on the natural resources remains stalled as Trump seeks a &quot;bigger, better deal,&quot; CBS News reported on March 4. White House officials publicly indicated that Zelensky must issue an apology and demonstrate a commitment to peace talks for discussions to resume. On March 4, Zelensky called the White House clash &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his willingness to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Waltz suggested on March 5 that Trump may lift the pause on military assistance once peace talks are arranged and more confidence-building measures are taken, Reuters reported. The long-debated agreement would establish a fund to which Ukraine would contribute 50% of proceeds from the future monetization of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. Ukraine previously rejected two U.S. proposals due to the absence of security guarantees, but negotiations are continuing amid mounting pressure from Washington.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-us-delegations-to-meet-soon-for-negotiations-zelenskys-top-aide-says/	2025-03-05T10:37:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1659182865.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 16	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 16 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Feb. 24&#x2013;March 2, 2025. The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Ukraine&#x2019;s Bureau of Economic Security leadership race narrows to 30 candidates The selection process for the next head of the Bureau of Economic Security (BES) has moved to the next stage, with the competition commission reviewing applications from 43 candidates. Following the initial document screening, 30 applicants have been approved to proceed, having met the formal eligibility requirements of the competition. The next phases will include skills assessments, legislative knowledge tests, and integrity checks. Ukraine passes overdue IMF-mandated judicial reform bill Ukraine&#x2019;s Parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, has approved draft law #12368-1, establishing a new judicial framework to replace the controversial Kyiv District Administrative Court (OASK). The bill, which received 234 votes in favor and was welcomed by the G7 Ambassadors, marks the fulfillment of a long-overdue International Monetary Fund structural benchmark, originally due by Dec. 31, 2024. However, the final version deviates from initial IMF recommendations, opting to create two separate courts: The High Qualification Commission of Judges (HQCJ) is required to announce a competition for judicial appointments within one month of the law&#x2019;s enactment, with international experts playing a role in the selection process for the next three years. Ukraine&#x2019;s stock market regulator adopts updated ethics code in line with IMF commitments Ukraine&#x2019;s National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC) has adopted an updated Employee Ethics Code, aligning with recent amendments to the Law on State Regulation of Capital Markets and Organized Commodity Markets. The decision was announced by NSSMC Chairman Ruslan Mahomedov via Telegram on Feb. 28. The revision is part of a structural benchmark under Ukraine&#x2019;s Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies with the IMF, with a deadline set for January 2025. According to Mahomedov, the updated code was developed in consultation with experts from the World Bank and the IMF, ensuring it meets international best practices. Ukrainian government adopts new public investment allocation mechanism On Feb. 28, 2025, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine approved a new framework for allocating public investment, aimed at prioritizing state-funded projects based on their strategic importance. The unified project portfolio will rank investment initiatives according to their relevance to Ukraine&#x2019;s national goals and regional development needs. The government has also established an Interagency Commission to oversee the distribution of state budget funds for investment projects, chaired by the Minister of Finance. The commission will include representatives from key ministries, including the economy, regional development, health, energy, and digital transformation ministries. Ukraine moves forward with $1 billion purchase of Russian-made nuclear reactors Ukraine&#x2019;s Verkhovna Rada has cleared the way for state-owned Energoatom to proceed with its $1 billion acquisition of Russian-made nuclear reactors from Bulgaria, after all blocking resolutions against draft law #11392 were rejected. The deal involves the purchase of two Rosatom reactors originally intended for the Belene Nuclear Power Plant in Bulgaria, to be used for the construction of reactor units No.3 and No. 4 at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant. While the legislation allowing the purchase has been approved, Energoatom still lacks the necessary parliamentary authorization for the actual construction of the new units. Ukrainian law enforcements raid leading pharmaceutical plants amid pricing probe National Police of Ukraine conducted raids on three of the country&#x2019;s largest pharmaceutical manufacturers on Feb. 28, &#x201C;Economichna Pravda&#x201D; reported. According to the National Police statement, raids were a part of ongoing criminal investigations. The searches follow a recent decision by Ukraine&#x2019;s National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) to introduce drug price regulations, cutting the cost of essential medications by 30% from March 1, 2025. The NSDC had also recommended that law enforcement agencies intensify efforts to combat price manipulation and financial abuses in the pharmaceutical sector.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-16/	2025-03-05T09:52:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2197731140.jpg
Ukraine, EU drafting plan for first steps toward lasting peace, Zelensky says	Ukraine and Europe are working on a plan for the first steps toward a just and sustainable peace as Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion enters its fourth year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 5. &quot;We are preparing a plan of first steps to bring about a just and sustainable peace. We are working on it quickly. It will be ready soon,&quot; he wrote on Telegram. Zelensky will participate in a special European Council meeting on March 6, where EU leaders are expected to discuss continued support for Ukraine as well as security guarantees for a lasting peace. The president said in his Telegram post that he had discussed the plan with with Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob, briefing him on the recent leaders&apos; summit in London and joint European efforts. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosted a summit on March 2, gathering key Western leaders, including Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, to coordinate support for Ukraine. Zelensky wrote on Telegram that Europe has a common vision for ending Russia&apos;s war and securing long-term stability. &quot;It should be at the table of future negotiations together with Ukraine and the United States,&quot; he added. The statement comes as U.S. and Russian officials held talks in Istanbul on Feb. 27, following their initial meeting in Riyadh on Feb. 18. The discussions, part of U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s push for a swift peace deal, have raised concerns in Kyiv and Europe that Washington is sidelining its allies. Zelensky&apos;s remarks follow a dramatic shift in U.S. foreign policy, with Trump echoing Kremlin narratives and accusing the Ukrainian president of prolonging the war. Washington has frozen all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, a move widely seen as an attempt to pressure Kyiv into talks with Russia. Earlier, the Ukrainian president proposed initial steps toward peace, including releasing prisoners and a ceasefire in the air and sea.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-eu-drafting-plan-for-first-steps-toward-lasting-peace-zelensky-says/	2025-03-05T09:46:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/03/e6616e5fc8719714246c2f23f2404b17_1679921770_extra_large.jpeg
Zelensky to take part in special European Council meeting on March 6	President Volodymyr Zelensky will take part in a special meeting of the European Council on March 6, a senior EU official confirmed to the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We are living in a defining moment for Ukraine and European security,&quot; European Council President Antonio Costa said ahead of the summit. Discussions will focus on strengthening support for Ukraine as Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion enters its fourth year. Participants will also discuss &quot;European contributions to the necessary security guarantees required to ensure a lasting peace in Ukraine,&quot; the European Council said in a statement on its website. EU leaders are also expected to adopt a communique reaffirming that European security cannot be negotiated without European participation, Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne reported. The meeting follows growing concerns in Kyiv and European capitals over U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s diplomatic outreach to Russia, including direct talks between American and Russian officials in Istanbul on Feb. 27 and Riyadh on Feb. 18. Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and other senior Western officials gathered in London on March 2 for a summit hosted by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to coordinate Ukraine policy. Zelensky arrived in London on March 1 following a turbulent visit to Washington, where a planned natural resources agreement with the U.S. collapsed after a tense Oval Office exchange with Trump. The fallout has fueled speculation about the future of U.S.- Ukraine relations. Washington has frozen all military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv, a move widely seen as an attempt to pressure Zelensky into talks with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-take-part-in-special-european-council-meeting-on-march-6/	2025-03-05T09:10:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190701439.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — Dark days for Ukraine	The following is the March 4, 2025 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. This week&#x2019;s newsletter was originally going to be about the Trump&#x2013;JD Vance&#x2013;President Volodymyr Zelensky clash in the Oval Office and the subsequent collapse of the minerals deal &#x2014; itself a shocking turn of events after weeks of tense negotiations. But then, apparently as punishment for Zelensky not being &#x201C;grateful enough,&#x201D; as Vance put it, or as Trump and others have said, for &#x201C;not being ready for peace,&#x201D; reports sufaced the U.S. was halting military aid to Ukraine. Understandably, Ukrainians were outraged at the decision &#x2014; we did a piece collecting reactions. Read it here. The freeze reportedly goes into effect immediately, impacting over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition and affecting not only future aid but also weapons already in transit. One of the most worrying aspects of the freeze in the immediate future is how Ukraine will replace the U.S.-provided air defense missiles that help protect Ukrainian cities from Russian aerial attacks. Beyond the shock of the U.S. pulling its support for Ukraine at a time like this, the impact of Ukraine being unable to protect its skies could have repercussions that extend for generations. Less protection means more civilian deaths and more damage to infrastructure. A less safe Ukraine means more people will flee abroad, which puts strain on both Europe&apos;s and Ukraine&#x2019;s economies. That&#x2019;s fewer people in Ukraine to help with recovery efforts post-war. Further damage to infrastructure means higher costs to rebuild. But the loss of the U.S. &#x2014; the world&#x2019;s largest military superpower &#x2014; as an ally runs the risk of a Russian victory in Ukraine and, ultimately, the disappearance of Ukraine itself. And what would that mean for the world? Truth be told, it saddens me to have to repeat points I&#x2019;ve made in this newsletter and elsewhere since the start of the full-scale invasion, but apparently, the world needs reminding. Ukraine&#x2019;s grain exports feed millions of people around the world. If those exports stop, even temporarily, people will be left without food, and prices will rise &#x2014; all over the world. It happened at the start of the war and can happen again. Millions &#x2014; yes, millions &#x2014; of Ukrainian refugees would flee across the border into Europe, causing a crisis. I hardly doubt any European country is ready for it. Russia would be in possession of all of Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources, and all those &#x201C;minerals&#x201D; everyone has been talking about would go to benefit Vladimir Putin and his cronies; it would be in control of the military-industrial complex that has been created in Ukraine over the last three years. Russia would be richer and stronger, and the world would be less safe. One thing that can and should be done to counteract the Trump administration&#x2019;s move away from Ukraine and toward Russia &#x2014; Europe must fully seize the some $200 billion of frozen Russian assets and send them to Ukraine. Markets have responded to the Zelensky-Trump-Vance showdown, with Ukraine&apos;s international bonds falling to their lowest point in over a month on March 3 as optimism wanes around a quick end to the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported. According to Tradeweb data cited by Reuters, the 2036 maturity experienced the steepest decline, dropping 4.5 cents to 60.775 cents on the dollar and reaching a one-month low. Bonds tied to economic performance declined the most, with trading activity remaining high, one trader told Reuters. &quot;The new U.S. administration calls for pessimism,&quot; Paul McNamara at GAM told Reuters. &quot;I see no economic reason to invest.&quot; Read more here. Ukraine&apos;s National Police conducts searches at one of the country&apos;s largest pharmaceutical companies on Feb. 28, 2025. (Ukraine&apos;s National Police / Facebook)Storm brewing?Late last week, on Feb. 28, just before Vance and Trump ambushed Zelenksy in the Oval Office, three of Ukraine&#x2019;s major pharmaceutical companies experienced their own unpleasant surprise. Ekonomichna Pravda reported, citing its source, that Ukraine&apos;s National Police had conducted searches at the offices and employee homes of Ukrainian pharmaceutical giants Arterium, Farmak, and Darnytsia. &quot;Those who are conducting searches are requesting information that could be obtained by simply sending a request. Everything is reminiscent of the &#x201C;Mazepa case,&#x201D; the source told EP. The &#x201C;Mazepa case&#x201D; in question refers to Ukrainian investor and businessman Ihor Mazepa, who in early 2024 was yanked out of his car at the border with Poland and searched by the police, while his accounts were frozen. It was widely considered punishment for speaking out against heavy-handed treatment by law enforcement on businesses. Why the raids? It&#x2019;s not exactly clear yet. Zelensky&#x2019;s administration could be putting pressure on the industry after he ordered the government to do something about &#x201C;unreasonably high drug prices&#x201D; in Ukraine. After Zelensky&#x2019;s statement about pricing, the government capped the markup of drug prices at 35% for over-the-counter drugs, and the Health Ministry announced that the price of the 100 most popular drugs would come down by 30% on March 1. KMPG UkraineM&amp;A: Staying the courseIn other news &#x2014; M&amp;A deals in 2024 showed relative stability despite the war, with the total volume of deals, 49, equal to that of 2023 and a disclosed total deal value of around $1.1 billion, KMPG said in a recent report. &#x201C;Despite a 15.7% decline in total overall deal value, adjusted figures that exclude exceptionally large transactions indicate a 40.5% increase,&#x201D; the Kyiv-based accounting firm wrote. Ukrainian capital staying in the country due to wartime currency restrictions, war risk insurance mechanisms, and government-led infrastructure recovery initiatives have all contributed to continued M&amp;A activity. It has also been helped along by Ukraine&#x2019;s privatization efforts, which delivered record revenues of Hr 12 billion ($300 million) in 2024, KMPG said in its report. Read the full report here. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has lowered its 2025 growth forecast for Ukraine&#x2019;s economy, now expecting 3.5% growth instead of the previously projected 4.7%. The downgrade comes as inflation accelerates due to the ongoing war, which reached 12% in December. After the London-based bank announced it had started offering some services in Ukraine on Feb. 11, Ukraine&#x2019;s central bank came out and said Revolut had not obtained the proper licence to do so. Revolut has denied any wrongdoing, saying that it is merely offering EU accounts to Ukrainian residents on a cross-border basis and that it does not plan to open Ukrainian accounts without further authorization. Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy company, DTEK, is in talks with several suppliers for a two-year liquefied natural gas import contract into the country, CEO Maxim Timchenko said in an interview at IE Week in London, Bloomberg reported. In June 2024, DTEK signed the first major deal with U.S. Venture Global to supply LNG to Ukraine for two years. It was the first time Ukraine purchased U.S. LNG directly. This figure includes direct and indirect damage caused by disrupted logistics, increased fertilizer and fuel costs, expenses for land reclamation and demining, and occupied territories, Agriculture Minister Vitalii Koval said on Feb. 25 during a World Bank report presentation. The agricultural sector plays a vital role in Ukraine&apos;s economy, comprising approximately 20% of the country&apos;s GDP.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-business-roundup-dark-days-for-ukraine/	2025-03-05T09:02:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201830448.jpg
How Trump’s Ukraine peace plan could backfire	U.S. President Donald Trump entered the White House promising to bring a swift end to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and his first few weeks in office have proven he&#x2019;s determined to follow through. While his endeavour to fulfil a campaign promise in itself is not too surprising, the way he is approaching the issue has stunned not only Ukraine, but also the U.S.&#x2019;s long-term global allies, who are now scrambling to adjust to a world in which Washington cannot be viewed as a reliable security partner. The Kyiv Independent spoke to George Barros, Russia team lead at the Institute for the Study of War, who explains why America&#x2019;s global adversaries will be &#x201C;salivating&#x201D; at what is currently unfolding on the global stage.	https://kyivindependent.com/how-trumps-ukraine-peace-plan-could-backfire/	2025-03-05T07:58:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_0406.jpg
70% of Americans say Ukraine is not to blame for war with Russia, poll shows	An overwhelming majority of Americans do not believe Ukraine is more to blame for the war waged against it by Russia, according to an Ipsos poll published by Reuters on March 5. The poll follows a dramatic shift in U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump, who has echoed Kremlin narratives, initiated direct talks with Moscow while excluding Kyiv, and accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of prolonging the war. According to the survey, 70% of adults surveyed disagreed with the statement &quot;Ukraine is more to blame for starting the war.&quot; Seven percent agreed. Among Democratic respondents, 81% rejected the idea that Ukraine was to blame, while 62% of Republicans shared that stance. The poll was conducted among 1,174 U.S. adults between March 3-4 and comes amid heightened tensions between Washington and Kyiv following the contentious Feb. 28 Oval Office meeting between Trump, Zelensky, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance. The talks, originally intended to finalize a mineral deal between the two countries, ended in a public dispute, leading to the cancellation of the agreement. Since the meeting, some U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers have escalated their criticism of Zelensky, with some even suggesting he should resign. Washington has also frozen all military aid to Ukraine, a move widely seen as an attempt to pressure Kyiv into peace talks with Moscow. Additionally, the U.S. has halted intelligence sharing with Ukraine, threatening its ability to strike Russian targets, CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed to Fox Business on March 5.	https://kyivindependent.com/70-of-americans-say-ukraine-is-not-to-blame-for-war-with-russia-poll-shows/	2025-03-05T07:56:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2147987555-1.jpg
Drone coalition mobilizes over $2 billion to boost Ukraine's defense, ministry says	The drone coalition has received over 2 billion euros ($2.1 billion) in assistance from partners in the first year of its operation, the Defense Ministry announced on March 5. The allied initiative, co-headed by the U.K. and Latvia, was launched in January 2024 to bolster Ukraine&apos;s arsenal of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which became a crucial capability on the battlefield. Nearly 20 countries joined the coalition as of late 2024. &quot;The main goal of the coalition is to provide the Ukrainian Defense Forces with drones and strengthen the defense industry of Ukraine and partner countries to create a technological advantage over... (Russia) in the long term,&quot; the statement read.Kyiv employs long-range drones to strike deep into Russian territory, targeting military infrastructure such as airfields, oil refineries, and logistical hubs. On Feb. 9, the Defense Ministry launched the &quot;Drone Line&quot; initiative to accelerate drone deployment on the battlefield. Ukraine has also developed long-range missile-drone hybrids, such as the Palianytsia and Peklo models, featuring turbojet engines as alternatives to cruise missiles. President Volodymyr Zelensky has set a target of producing at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/drone-coalition-receives-over-2-billion-from-partners-to-boost-ukraines-defense-ministry-says/	2025-03-05T05:50:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2152788960.jpg
Trump may resume Ukraine aid after further progress toward peace, White House says	U.S. President Donald Trump may lift the pause on military support for Ukraine once peace talks are arranged and more confidence-building measures are taken, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said on March 5, according to Reuters. Trump paused all military assistance and, reportedly, intelligence sharing earlier this week after his public spat with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, derailing plans to sign a bilateral deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources. White House officials signaled that Zelensky must issue an apology and demonstrate readiness for peace to get the talks back on track. On March 4, the Ukrainian president made a statement in which he called the quarrel &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his commitment to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Waltz called the statement a &quot;good, positive first step.&quot; Similarly, Trump voiced appreciation for Zelensky&apos;s words and mentioned the statement in his address to Congress. &quot;I think if we can nail down these negotiations and move towards these negotiations, and in fact, put some confidence-building measures on the table, then the president will take a hard look at lifting this pause,&quot; Waltz said on the Fox &amp; Friends program, according to Reuters. According to Trump&apos;s aide, officials are leading talks on a specific date, location, and team for the negotiations. Ukraine has repeatedly stressed that security guarantees that would prevent Russia from resuming its aggression at a later date are a necessary condition for any peace talks. The Trump administration has retorted that the minerals deal is a security commitment of its own and pushed to broker a quick resolution between Kyiv and Moscow. Zelensky reaffirmed his readiness to sign the deal in his statement on March 4, but CBS News reported that parameters are still unclear as Trump seeks better terms.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-may-resume-ukraine-aid-after-further-steps-toward-peace-confidence-building-white-house-says/	2025-03-05T05:41:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2200263755.jpg
Russia jails British volunteer fighting for Ukraine for 19 years	A Russian court sentenced James Scott Rhys Anderson, a British volunteer who was fighting for Ukraine in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, to 19 years in prison, independent outlet Mediazona reported on March 5. Footage of Anderson, 22, in Russian captivity emerged in November 2024. Russian authorities later confirmed that the British national was in their custody. The court sentenced Anderson on &quot;terrorism&quot; and &quot;mercenarism&quot; charges. Russia often portrays foreign volunteers fighting for Ukraine as &quot;mercenaries&quot; and claims they are not entitled to protection as prisoners of war. The British volunteer is to spend the first five years in prison and the rest of the term in a high-security penal colony. The court considered Anderson&apos;s case in a closed session. A soldier of the Ukrainian Armed Forces who served in the same unit as the U.K. national was allegedly brought in as a witness. Anderson pleaded guilty, according to the court. It is unclear whether the confession was forced, as Ukrainian officials and human rights groups pointed to widespread cases of abuse and torture of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POW) and captive civilians by Russia. Russia accused Anderson of &quot;illegally crossing the border&quot; into Kursk Oblast in mid-November in 2024 and committing &quot;criminal actions against civilians.&quot; The claims could not be verified, and Moscow has sentenced a number of Ukrainian POWs and volunteer fighters on similar charges without providing evidence. Two other Brits, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, were captured by Russian forces in Mariupol in 2022 and sentenced to death before being released in a prisoner exchange.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-jails-british-volunteer-fighting-for-ukraine-for-19-year/	2025-03-05T05:23:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-05-14_51_21.jpeg
Ukraine destroys Russian long-range surveillance system, shows combat footage	Drones of the Ukrainian Hart Brigade&apos;s Falcon unit destroyed a Russian Murom-M long-range surveillance system near the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces said on March 5. Vovchansk is an embattled town some 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Kharkiv that has seen heavy battles since Russia launched a new offensive in the area in May 2024. Russian forces &quot;were not saved by the anti-drone net that covered it (Murom-M) from all sides. The first two &apos;birds&apos; of the Falcon pilots punched a hole in it, and the third finally destroyed the system,&quot; the statement read. 0:00/1&#xD7;The Hart Brigade reportedly destroyed the Russian Murom-M long-range surveillance system near the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces said on March 5, 2025. (Khortytsia group of forces/Telegram)Russian troops and a vehicle used to transport infantry and ammunition to their positions came under attack in the same area, the Khortytsia group of forces said. Throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing the way wars are fought. For outnumbered Ukrainian forces, drones have been one of the key weapons to strike Russian warships, naval bases, oil refineries, and airfields inside occupied territories and deep behind Russia&apos;s lines.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-forces-destroy-russian-long-range-surveillance-system-show-combat-footage/	2025-03-05T05:12:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-05-at-14_17_52.png
Why doesn't Zelensky wear a suit?	When President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived at the White House on Feb. 28 to discuss ending the war that had inflicted tremendous tragedy on his country since its escalation in 2022, he was asked a question he likely least expected to hear at such a critical moment. &quot;Why don&apos;t you wear a suit?&quot; &quot;You&apos;re at the highest level in this country&apos;s office, and you refuse to wear a suit,&quot; Brian Glenn, the chief White House correspondent for the right-wing Real America&apos;s Voice TV channel, asked Zelensky during his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. &quot;Do you own a suit?&quot; Glenn continued. &quot;A lot of Americans have problems with you not respecting the office.&quot; It was no coincidence that Glenn was the one asking this not only inappropriate but also extremely disrespectful question. Glenn is considered to be one of the favorite reporters of Trump and his supporters. He appeared to be merely mirroring Trump&#x2019;s irritation with Zelensky&#x2019;s outfit, which he had made clear just shortly before, while meeting Zelensky outside the White House upon arrival. &quot;You&apos;re all dressed up today,&#x201D; Trump said to a wartime leader. On that day, Zelensky was wearing a simple all-black outfit, in line with his wartime style that he had adopted on Feb. 24, 2022, when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Oval Office meeting between Zelensky and Trump led to a heated argument after an invited interference of U.S. Vice President JD Vance, resulting in the cancellation of a planned mineral deal and Trump&#x2019;s decision to halt all military aid for Ukraine on March 3. But amid a major U.S. foreign policy shift &#x2013; abandoning allies and aligning with a longtime adversary, Russia &#x2013; Glenn&#x2019;s suit question continued to make headlines and receive reactions on social media in the ensuing days. According to Zoya Zvynyatskivska, a Ukrainian fashion historian, comments about clothing are never the cause but rather the result of someone&apos;s prejudice and dislike, and it is impossible to dress in a way that would change that attitude. &#x201C;In Trump&apos;s mind, there is no war. Everything has already ended,&quot; Zvynyatskivska told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;If Zelensky takes off his military-style outfit and puts on a suit, what does that mean? It means he agrees that the war is over.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky meet in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, DC, U.S. on Feb. 28, 2025. (Andrew Harnik / Getty Images)&quot;Yes, Zelensky dresses demonstratively. But the only message he wants to convey with his clothing is: &apos;In my country, there is a war,&apos;&quot; Zvynyatskivska says. &quot;Everyone wants to forget. Everyone wants to move on. But he keeps reminding them.&quot; In response to Glenn&#x2019;s question, Zelensky said, &quot;I will wear a costume after this war will finish.&quot; &quot;Maybe something like yours, yes. Maybe something better, I don&apos;t know,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe something cheaper.&quot; Following the meeting, Axios reported, citing two anonymous sources, that Trump&apos;s advisers told Zelensky&apos;s team multiple times that it would be more respectful for Ukraine&apos;s leader to &quot;ditch his military-style attire&quot; when visiting the White House. &quot;One small but not insignificant factor&quot; that irritated Trump was the fact that Zelensky ultimately did not wear a suit, Axios reported. The last time Zelensky was seen in a suit was in his video address shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the start of the full-scale invasion in the early hours of Feb. 24, 2022. In his next address later that day, Zelensky appeared in a khaki T-shirt. The next morning, he wore a fleece pullover of the same color for his morning address. Since then, he has mostly been wearing military-style attire, only swapping it for a vyshyvanka &#x2014; a traditional Ukrainian embroidered shirt &#x2014; on holidays or special occasions. &quot;We all know that his life was already in danger on the very first day (of the full-scale invasion). Leaders of other countries even offered him evacuation, but he refused,&quot; Zvyniatskovska says. &quot;He was already wearing a bulletproof vest and comfortable clothing underneath it because, at that moment, his life was in danger.&quot; Even when Ukrainian troops liberated Kyiv Oblast in the spring of 2022 and the danger to his life was seemingly not as immediate, Zelensky chose to stick to simple military-style garments &#x201C;in solidarity with the people who are fighting,&#x201D; says Zvyniatskovska. &quot;He&apos;s not wearing military uniform,&quot; she says. &quot;But wearing khaki clothing that is convenient and hints at what is happening in your country &#x2014; I believe this is a beautiful, powerful non-verbal statement that reminds everyone who meets him (about the war in Ukraine).&quot; Left top: Pope Francis meets with President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Studio of Paul VI Hall in Vatican City on May 13, 2023.

(Aaron Chown / Pool / Getty Images)Zelensky has said numerous times that he would wear a suit only after Ukraine wins the war. In the documentary by Ukrainian journalist and TV host Dmytro Komarov called &quot;A Year,&quot; Zelensky even showed the blazer he plans to wear on Ukraine&apos;s victory day. &quot;It&apos;s a symbol. It means that the war will be over soon, we will win soon, and we all will wear suits again,&quot; Zelensky said. During the latest Oval Office meeting, Zelensky wore an all-black ensemble, including a polo shirt by the Ukrainian brand Damirli, adorned with a trident &#x2014; Ukraine&apos;s coat of arms. On Instagram, the brand wrote that the polo Zelensky wore is &quot;not merely a garment &#x2014; it is the uniform of a modern warrior, a symbol of the unbreakable spirit of a nation standing for its freedom.&quot; &quot;History remembers leaders whose choice of clothing became part of their fight and a reflection of their era,&quot; Damirli wrote. &quot;Yes, it&apos;s not a suit, but it&apos;s a kind of intermediate option. I think he really demonstrated respect,&quot; Zvyniatskovska says. &quot;Very modest, beautiful outfit in black, restrained color, no khaki.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s team, including Presidential Office Head Andriy Yermak who was wearing a suit on Feb. 28, adhered to the White House&apos;s formal dress code. &quot;They dressed according to the standard for an international event,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;Everyone on the team was dressed perfectly appropriately.&quot; But Zelensky&apos;s outfit was &quot;symbolic,&quot; it was a statement, according to Zvyniatskovska. Zelensky is not the first wartime leader to disregard official dress code during high-profile visits or meetings. The Ukrainian president is now often compared with U.K. Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who, during World War II, also chose not to wear a suit during his visit to the White House in January 1942. Then-British Prime Minister Winston Churchill outside the White House, wearing his &quot;siren suit,&quot; on Jan. 17, 1942. (Hulton Archive / Getty Images)A photo of him dressed in a &quot;siren suit,&quot; a practical one-piece garment designed for air raids, went viral following the latest Oval Office clash. &quot;Zvyniatskovska says history offers many examples of people &#x2014; like Mother Teresa &#x2014; who chose to wear signature outfits as statements, even at high-profile events.&quot; &quot;He&apos;s not the first person in the 21st century to break standard etiquette rules to convey their message,&quot; Zvyniatskovska says, adding that Zelensky was wearing the same polo during his meeting with King Charles III in the U.K. on March 2. &quot;And everything went fine,&quot; she says. &quot;So it&apos;s not the clothing that is the problem.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s decision to stick to his wartime style during the Oval Office meeting gained significant support in Ukraine. When The Kyiv Independent asked people on the streets of Kyiv whether Zelensky should have worn a suit, the majority of respondents felt he made the right choice not to. &quot;As far as I remember, America supports freedom so, in my opinion, everyone can wear what they want,&quot; Stanislav Rakitin told the Kyiv Independent. Ukrainian soldier Vadym, who is stationed near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, told the Kyiv Independent that he, too, supports Zelensky&#x2019;s symbolic choice.

(Dursun Aydemir / Anadolu Agency / Getty Images)&quot;His position that he&apos;s at war and not into suits seems reasonable to me,&quot; he says. &#xA0; &quot;The fact that they&apos;ve been nitpicking about his clothing only shows their pitifulness. There&apos;s no need to apologize for anything. They&apos;re just nitpicking. They&apos;re looking for a reason. No one in the world said a word about it. (Former U.S. President Joe) Biden didn&apos;t say anything.&quot; &#xA0; Ukrainian journalist and soldier Petro Shuklinov says that Zelensky&apos;s attire not only sends a message to the world but also to his own soldiers, emphasizing: &#x201C;I am here to bring weapons. I am here to bring security. My country is at war, and I represent my country. I cannot do otherwise.&apos;&quot; &quot;I didn&apos;t vote for him, but for me, the president is an institution. And now, wherever he is, he represents me, my country, and all our people. Criticizing him is criticizing me. And if anyone wants to make a remark to me, I invite them to come to Ukraine,&quot; Shuklinov said. Hi, this is Daria Shulzhenko, the author of this story. After watching the now infamous Oval Office meeting multiple times, I can say this: No matter what President Volodymyr Zelensky wore that day, the outcome would have been the same. It was never about his outfit &#x2014; it was about how he was treated. But I hope this piece serves as a reminder that Ukrainian soldiers are the ones fighting the hardest battle for freedom right now. And as you can see, they have no issue with what he wears. While they are on the battlefield, we are making sure their voices are heard around the world. So please consider supporting our reporting.	https://kyivindependent.com/why-doesnt-zelensky-wear-a-suit/	2025-03-05T04:36:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/Artboard-1.jpg
US halts intelligence sharing with Ukraine, FT reports	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. The U.S. has halted intelligence sharing with Kyiv, threatening Ukraine&apos;s ability to strike Russian targets amid the full-scale war, the Financial Times (FT) reported on March 5, citing undisclosed sources. The reported move follows Washington&apos;s decision to freeze all military aid supplies to Ukraine following a public spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump. There have been conflicting claims as to whether this also concerns intelligence sharing, a crucial capability that allows Ukraine to strike Russian targets. The British tabloid Daily Mail previously reported that the U.S. banned the U.K. from sharing Washington-obtained intelligence with Kyiv. Ukrainian and U.S. officials have not confirmed the claims, which could not be independently verified.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-halts-intelligence-sharing-with-ukraine-ft-reports/	2025-03-05T04:26:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1494251877.jpg
Russia's oil, gas budget revenue in February drops by 18% year-on-year	Russia&apos;s budget revenue from oil and gas trade in February decreased by 18% year-on-year and by 2.3% compared to January, Reuters reported on March 5, citing Russian Finance Ministry data. Oil and gas revenues last month amounted to 771.3 billion rubles ($8.6 billion), a significant drop from 945.6 billion rubles ($10.5 billion) in February 2024 and a moderate decrease in comparison to 789.1 billion rubles ($8.8 billion) in January 2025. The news underscores Russia&apos;s economic woes amid its full-scale war against Ukraine and the heavy Western sanctions imposed since 2022. Oil and gas exports, which have traditionally represented a significant portion of Russia&apos;s federal budget revenue and play a key role in sustaining its war economy, have been particularly targeted by Western economic restrictions. The previous U.S. Biden administration rolled out several waves of sanctions against Russia&apos;s oil and gas industry and its &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of tankers, most recently in January. The EU, which has traditionally been the primary buyer of Russian fossil fuels, sought to pivot away from Russian supplies while Ukraine has launched a campaign of long-range drone strikes against Russia&apos;s energy facilities. In spite of this, fossil fuel exports continue to be crucial in feeding Russia&apos;s war chest, representing about 30% of the country&apos;s federal revenue last year. Moscow has managed to redirect much of its sales to other major markets, such as China and India. A February study also showed that while EU countries spent about $20.3 billion in military support for Ukraine in 2024, they bought Russian fossil fuels worth about $23.5 billion in the same period. The future of sanctions against Russia also remains uncertain as the new Trump administration, which has adopted a more amicable stance toward Moscow, floated the idea of sanctions relief as part of peace efforts. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-oil-gas-revenue-in-february-drops-by-18-year-on-year/	2025-03-05T03:50:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
Minsk could be best place for trilateral talks between Russia, US, Ukraine, Kremlin says	Minsk could be the best place to host potential trilateral talks between the U.S., Ukraine, and Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Russian news agency Interfax on March 5. Peskov&apos;s statement follows a proposal by Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko to host U.S. President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for peace talks. &quot;This issue has not been brought up or discussed in any way. But, of course, Minsk is the best place for us. It is our main ally, so it is the best place for negotiations,&quot; Peskov said. According to Peskov, the Kremlin is &quot;positive&quot; about Zelensky&apos;s stated readiness to &quot;come to the negotiating table.&quot; In a statement on March 4, the Ukrainian president said that he and his team &quot;stand ready to work under President Trump&#x2019;s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts.&quot; He went on to propose the release of prisoners and a partial truce in the air and sea as first steps toward a peace deal. Zelensky&apos;s overture came days after his public clash with Trump in the Oval Office and after the U.S. paused all military aid to pressure Ukraine to talks. &quot;The question is with whom to sit (at the negotiating table). So far, there is still a legal prohibition for the Ukrainian president to negotiate with the Russian side. Therefore, in general, the approach is positive, but the nuances have not yet changed,&quot; Peskov added. Trump&apos;s recent stance on Ukraine, including his public rebuke of Zelensky and reported halt on U.S. military aid to Kyiv, has drawn praise from Russian officials while raising concerns among European allies. Since taking office, Trump has distanced the U.S. from its traditional role as Ukraine&apos;s primary supporter, instead questioning Kyiv&apos;s commitment to peace and implying that Ukraine shares blame for the ongoing war. Trump, echoing Kremlin rhetoric on the war in Ukraine, said at the end of February the country should &quot;forget&quot; about joining NATO, which the country sees as a security guarantee against a future Russian invasion. Russia has repeatedly presented NATO expansion as a &quot;justification&quot; for the war. The U.S. also voted alongside Russia on Feb. 24 against a U.N. resolution that condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/minsk-could-be-best-place-for-trilateral-talks-between-russia-us-ukraine-kremlin-says/	2025-03-05T03:35:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245735181.jpeg
US military aid freeze remains in place so far despite Zelensky's statement, WSJ reports	The pause on U.S. military assistance for Ukraine will remain in place until U.S. President Donald Trump decides that President Volodymyr Zelensky supports peace talks with Russia, the Wall Street Journal reported on March 5, citing undisclosed U.S. official sources. The sources reportedly said it remains unclear whether Zelensky&apos;s recent statement, in which he affirmed commitment to peace and called his public spat with Trump &quot;regrettable,&quot; would be enough to restart the U.S. aid. Relations between Kyiv and Washington have been tense in recent weeks, especially after Zelensky, Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance entered into a heated argument in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. The spat, after which the U.S. leaders berated Zelensky as &quot;ungrateful&quot; and not &quot;ready for peace,&quot; derailed the signing of a natural resources agreement and preceded the Trump administration&apos;s decision to freeze all military assistance flowing to Ukraine. Officials from Trump&apos;s team, including his special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, privately stressed to Zelensky the need to mend the rift quickly before Trump&apos;s address to Congress on March 4, CNN reported, citing sources. The U.K. government has also reportedly played a major role in convincing Zelensky. According to the Telegraph, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the Ukrainian president on March 4 to urge him to back Trump&apos;s mineral agreement and relay what the U.S. president wished to hear. After Zelensky published his statement on social media, Trump voiced appreciation for his words but made no direct comment on the aid freeze. The New York Times also reported that the aid freeze remains in place at the moment. While U.S. officials stressed that the signing of the mineral deal is not fully off the table, it remains unclear when and if it will be signed. CBS News reported that Trump is currently seeking a &quot;bigger, better deal&quot; with Ukraine instead.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-military-aid-freeze-remains-in-place-so-far-despite-zelenskys-statement-wsj-reports/	2025-03-05T02:38:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203348355--1-.jpg
Utterly staggered' — Trump's Ukraine military aid freeze threatens the world order, expert says	A decision by the White House to suspend all military aid to Ukraine has stunned Kyiv and its European allies, throwing the very future of the established world order into doubt. &quot;I&apos;m utterly staggered. It&apos;s just extraordinary,&quot; Timothy Ash, associate fellow at the Chatham House&#x2019;s Russia and Eurasia Programme, told the Kyiv Independent on March 4. &quot;It&apos;s almost like the collapse of the Soviet Union if you think of the scale of what we&apos;re seeing now, it&apos;s utterly remarkable.&quot; Ash said the implications of the military aid freeze, as well as U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s hostile rhetoric towards President Volodymyr Zelensky in recent weeks, will have profound implications not only for Ukraine, but the entire world. The Kyiv Independent: What&apos;s your initial reaction to the U.S. freezing military aid to Ukraine? Timothy Ash: Well, it&apos;s very disappointing and sad. I guess one conclusion from the White House meeting on Friday was that clearly the Trump administration is in the (Russian President Vladimir) Putin camp. I mean, NATO is kind of dead. Any idea that the U.S. will provide some kind of security guarantee to NATO and any peacekeeping operation in Ukraine is&#x2026; it&apos;s pretty clear that&apos;s not going to happen. The only positive for Ukraine, I guess, is that it&apos;s clear now where it stands. It&apos;s clear where it stands in respect to the U.S. and it has to make its decisions accordingly. The Kyiv Independent: Can you place all of this historically in terms of how significant these events are that we&apos;re seeing? Timothy Ash: Well, to be honest, it&apos;s utterly shocking. The mainstay of European security since World War II has been NATO. And I think people like (U.S. Vice President) JD Vance forget that the U.S. triggered Article 5 after the 9/11 terror attack &#x2014; NATO allies rallied around the U.S. It&apos;s also interesting that over the last few hours or 24 hours at least, Vance has been criticising some European countries in terms of their military capability. That&apos;s not gone down very well in the U.K. in particular, given that the U.K. and European countries also stood behind the U.S. in Afghanistan and Iraq. I mean, we lost (635) soldiers in both conflicts. So it is simply extraordinary&#x2026; that we need to think of a new security architecture in Europe. We&apos;re seeing huge shifts, tectonic shifts in alliances that I don&apos;t think anyone could quite have imagined. This idea that the Americans and the Russians are going to ally up against the Chinese, Europe left stranded &#x2014; what&apos;s Europe going to do? I mean it&apos;s just utterly extraordinary. The penny seems to have dropped in Europe, finally. They realize that they need to increase their own defense spending and ramp up military production. Obviously, we&apos;ve had announcements this morning from (European Commission President Ursula) Von der Leyen and various European politicians in that regard. But in the end, there is a short-term gap. Years of underinvestment, years of neglect in terms of defense spending have left us dependent on the Americans. Going forward, that can&apos;t endure. We have to change. How we get through the transition period is kind of difficult. The immediate problem is obviously Ukraine &#x2014; how we help Ukraine get through this existential threat to its survival. And longer term, Europe has to see Ukraine as being pretty central to its own defense with the Americans gone. Ukraine is a very capable military force. Almost the only thing standing behind Europe and Russia at the moment is Ukraine. So how do we work better with the Ukrainians to help build our own defense? That&apos;s a huge question mark. How do I put it into perspective? I&apos;m utterly staggered. It&apos;s just extraordinary. It&apos;s almost like the collapse of the Soviet Union if you think of the scale of what we&apos;re seeing now, it&apos;s utterly remarkable. The Kyiv Independent: The collapse of the Soviet Union was a generally positive event for the West &#x2013; is it fair to say that the ramifications of this change are going to be largely negative? Timothy Ash: The collapse of the Soviet Union set in motion many of the problems that we&apos;re dealing with today. Essentially, we spent the peace dividend. We assumed we&apos;d won the Cold War. And now, those chickens are coming home to roost. But we need to move on. It&apos;s the reality. We are where we are. And it&apos;s crystal clear now that the U.S. is not a reliable partner. Europe has some leverage &#x2014; it&apos;s a big economy, $27 trillion. It has buying power. I&apos;m not worried about the finances of stepping up defense production. I&apos;m just worried about the physical challenge of actually producing and buying weapons. In the short term, you&apos;d imagine the Americans would still be willing to sell them to Europe. It would be a huge market. And then eventually, Europe will step up and will be a significant arms producer. And again, I would imagine that would give it leverage also with the Americans. If in the end, this is a hegemonic battle for supremacy between the U.S. and China, I do find it a bit ironic, or a bit strange that the Americans have decided to tag along to the Russian economy, which is a $2 trillion economy. Ultimately, I don&apos;t see Russia giving the U.S. the scale in terms of that hegemonic battle with China. Europe is the economy that can give the Americans scale. So we have leverage. We have leverage in the short term in terms of purchases of weapons, big arms procurement deals that can produce, give jobs to Trump in the U.S. economy. And then longer term, I think it&apos;s very hard for the Americans to ignore the sheer scale of the European economy and its ability to help in terms of that hegemonic battle with the Chinese. And ultimately, if the Americans decide to do something else, then Europe should look for alternatives, right? It should look to improve its relations with China, it should look for better relations with Turkey and the Gulf states &#x2014; it should diversify its own national security. The Kyiv Independent: At least in the short term, is Russia the main winner out of all that&apos;s happening at the moment? Timothy Ash: In respect to Ukraine, you&apos;ve got to think so, yes. It&apos;s extraordinary that Trump went into negotiations with Russia over Ukraine. With a strong negotiating hand &#x2014; he could have ramped up sanctions, ramped up military supplies to Ukraine, there&apos;s lots of stuff to negotiate on territory, NATO membership, and he&apos;s given everything away before there&apos;s even been any negotiations. It&apos;s quite extraordinary. The Russians must think this is manna from heaven &#x2014; they just can&apos;t believe their luck. And we&apos;ve seen that Russia is now going back to its maximalist demands, this idea of the &quot;denazification&quot; of Kyiv, which means regime change, in effect. Ukraine is not a Nazi state, it&apos;s a democracy. But the Russians like to push that kind of angle. And also the demilitarization of Ukraine, which essentially means putting limitations on Ukraine&apos;s conventional military capability and its ability to defend itself, because they want to invade again. Unfortunately, because of Trump&apos;s shenanigans, the start of the negotiations has shifted significantly east &#x2014; we could have started around NATO membership. Ukraine may not likely have been given NATO membership, but it would have given some leverage for the negotiating team from the West. And a lot of this is in the context of negotiations around this mineral deal. And there&apos;s a chance that the freezing of aid is just a temporary thing and it&apos;s all designed to strong arm Zelensky into signing this mineral deal. Russian President Vladimir Putin smiles before the BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia, on Oct. 22, 2024. (Contributor/Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: Even if it is a negotiating tactic, it&apos;s causing a lot of damage. Timothy Ash: We&apos;ve already seen the damage to NATO itself. Faith and trust in NATO, trust in the U.S. as an ally has been very badly damaged. The scenes in the White House may have gone down well with some MAGA supporters in the U.S., but I think, from a world perspective, any foreign observer looking at that would say that this is just another U.S. ally that&apos;s been left down. Let down by the Americans like Afghanistan, like Iraq, like Vietnam&#x2026; there&apos;s a very long list of partners that the Americans have not stood by. I think that&apos;s very damaging to the U.S. over the long term. With the minerals deal, it seems to be the case that Trump wants a quick deal, he wants a quick win. He views the mineral deal as that. He views a ceasefire deal as a quick win. And Trump&apos;s not very good on the detail, right? I think the problem most Europeans have with the White House thinking around a ceasefire is, we&apos;ve been there before. We&apos;ve been there before with Minsk I, Minsk II &#x2013; numerous ceasefires have been broken (by the Russians). It&apos;s all pretty worrying for Ukraine. Ukraine has a good long-term outlook. Its economic position could be good with EU accession, recovery, and reconstruction bills, but it needs security. No investor will invest around this minerals deal if they don&apos;t feel Ukraine is secure. And how would you ensure security? That&apos;s the key question. The deal itself is not sufficient enough. The Kyiv Independent: Is there a chance that this could all backfire for the Trump administration? Timothy Ash: It weakens trust and confidence in the Americans. I would think Europe will be looking for alternatives. And if the Americans come asking for European help against China or another 9/11, I think Europe will say, &quot;no thank you. You made your choices on Ukraine.&quot; And mismanaging this peace process could be politically very damaging for (Trump). This could be, in terms of scale, multiple times more damaging than the disastrous U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Any deal that doesn&apos;t leave Ukraine secure could see the military collapse of Ukraine &#x2013; the social, economic, and political collapse of Ukraine &#x2013; and a complete victory of Russia over Ukraine. And I think that would be a devastating blow to European security and political, social instability also, because I think tens of millions of Ukrainians would move west. And that would be Trump&apos;s responsibility. He would have caused that. Does he care? Does he really understand any of this? I have my doubts.	https://kyivindependent.com/utterly-staggered-trumps-ukraine-military-aid-freeze-threatens-the-world-order-expert-says/	2025-03-05T02:27:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2198948272.jpg
Most French support assistance to Ukraine, sending peacekeepers, poll shows	Roughly two-thirds of the French favor maintaining or increasing aid to Ukraine and sending peacekeepers after the end of hostilities, BFM TV reported on March 4, citing a survey by the Elabe Institute. Many European leaders have reiterated their ongoing support for Ukraine amid U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s push for a swift deal to end the war. Still, some allies in Europe fear that they will have to shoulder the economic and security burdens of Ukraine&apos;s post-war recovery as the U.S. and Russia exclude them from talks on ending the war. Some 64% of respondents want France to continue providing assistance to Ukraine. Meanwhile, 20% of respondents believe that the amount of aid must be increased, and 44% think that it should be at the same level as it is now, according to the survey. Another 18% of respondents believe support must be reduced, and 17% say it should be terminated. Voters of the pro-Macron centrist coalition Ensemble, as well as the left-wing New Popular Front, are in favor of continued aid, while voters of the right-wing National Rally (FN) mostly want it reduced or terminated, BFM TV reported. France has allocated around 4.9 billion euros ($5.3 billion) in military assistance to Ukraine as of December 2024, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy said. This included Caesar howitzers, AMX-10RC armored vehicles, and Mirage 2000 jets. While ranking high in overall support, France has allocated a smaller portion of its GDP to support Ukraine than some smaller European nations, like the Netherlands, Denmark, or the Baltic countries. Though the share of those who want to continue supporting Ukraine has been growing since June 2024, three out of four respondents say they are not ready to pay more taxes for this purpose. Only 24% say they are ready to contribute. Around 68% of respondents opposed deploying French soldiers to Ukraine while the hostilities are ongoing. At the same time, 67% support sending peacekeeping troops after the signing of a peace agreement with Moscow to guarantee security and peace in Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer have been spearheading the idea of deploying peacekeeping troops to Ukraine to monitor a ceasefire. Regarding NATO, 40% of respondents favored Ukraine&apos;s accession after the war, and 30% now. Some 35% of respondents favored Ukraine joining the European Union after the war, and 31% favored it now. While President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Ukraine&apos;s preferred postwar security guarantee is NATO membership, the U.S. leadership has severely undercut that aim in the past few days. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said during the Ramstein summit on Feb. 12 that Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership was not a &quot;realistic outcome&quot; of peace negotiations. He also said that a return to the country&apos;s pre-2014 borders was &quot;an unrealistic objective.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/most-french-support-continued-assistance-to-ukraine-sending-peacekeepers-media-reports/	2025-03-05T01:57:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2008845928.jpg
Merz seeks to quickly push through $3.2 billion in German aid for Ukraine	Friedrich Merz, Germany&apos;s likely next chancellor, said he wants a defense aid package for Ukraine worth roughly 3 billion euros ($3.2 billion) approved by the current, outgoing parliament, Le Monde and AFP reported on March 4. Speaking at a press conference, Merz said he plans to raise the issue with outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who has opposed the package unless funded by additional government borrowing. Germany&apos;s incoming chancellor has presented extensive plans to reform debt break rules to boost defense spending as Europe is expected to take more responsibility for its security and Ukraine during the U.S. presidency of Donald Trump. Merz&apos;s conservative CDU/CSU alliance won the parliamentary elections on Feb. 23 with almost 29% of the vote. The Christian Democrats are in talks with Scholz&apos;s Social Democratic Party (SPD) on forming a new government, though the outgoing chancellor said he would not be personally part of the coalition negotiations. Germany has allocated 4 billion euros ($4.1 billion) in military support for Ukraine this year, and the additional package would raise this to 7 billion ($7.2 billion). The defense articles contained in the new assistance include three IRIS-T air defense systems, three Skyranger air defense systems, 10 howitzers, surface-to-air missiles, 20 protective vehicles, artillery shells, and drones, the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported. According to Merz, the additional aid &quot;can be approved now as off-budget expenditure.&quot; The CDU chairman has also unveiled plans for a massive defense spending boost, establishing a 500-billion-euro ($535 billion) special development and defense fund and exempting defense spending above 1% of GDP from debt break rules. As changes to debt break rules need support from two-thirds of the parliament to pass, Merz hopes to negotiate the bills&apos; passage with pro-Ukraine moderate parties in the current Bundestag as quickly as possible. In the next parliament, which must convene no later than March 25, Merz could expect stronger opposition. Roughly one-third of the seats will be held by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the Left Party (Die Linke), both of which oppose military aid for Ukraine. Germany has been Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. Berlin&apos;s role is especially important now that the Trump administration has frozen defense assistance for Ukraine, seeking to push Kyiv to the negotiating table.	https://kyivindependent.com/merz-seeks-to-quickly-push-through-3-2-billion-in-german-aid-for-ukraine/	2025-03-05T01:35:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/e99dfedf4f71ca1b5c178d4d5f33105c_1733742724_extra_large.jpeg
Ukraine natural resources deal not ready as Trump seeks better terms, CBS News reports	An agreement between Kyiv and Washington on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources is not finalized as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks a &quot;bigger, better deal,&quot; CBS News reported on March 4, citing undisclosed sources. The painstakingly negotiated deal was scheduled to be signed on Feb. 28, but that plan was derailed after a public clash between Trump and Zelensky, leaving the agreement&apos;s fate uncertain. After the U.S. froze military assistance for Kyiv, Zelensky issued a statement in which he called the spat &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his readiness to sign the minerals deal and work toward peace. Reuters reported that the deal was expected to be signed on March 4, but this claim was disputed by U.S. officials, and no agreement was concluded that day. CBS News did not clarify what terms Trump wants to see renegotiated. The long-debated agreement would establish a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the future monetization of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. The U.S. has reportedly put forth three proposals of the mineral deal, but the Ukrainian side has turned down the first two because they did not include security agreements, even as Washington ramped up the pressure. The third version was also free of concrete security commitments but included a line reading that the fund &quot;will be reinvested at least annually in Ukraine to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine.&quot; The Trump administration has been reluctant to commit to Ukraine&apos;s security, arguing that the economic agreement is a security guarantee of itself and that Europe should take responsibility for Kyiv&apos;s defense.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-minerals-deal-not-ready-as-trump-seeks-better-terms-cbs-new-reports/	2025-03-05T00:44:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202607825.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 2, injure 7 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed at least two civilians and injured at least seven others over the past day, regional authorities reported on March 5. Russian forces launched 181 drones from the Russian cities of Oryol, Kursk, Bryansk, Millerovo, Primorsk-Akhtarsk, and from Cape Chauda in the Russian-occupied Crimea against Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Russia also reportedly launched three Iskander M/KN-23 ballistic missiles from Voronezh Oblast and an S-300 anti-aircraft guided missile from Kursk Oblast. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 115 drones over Kharkiv, Sumy, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Odesa, and Cherkasy oblasts, the Air Force said. Another 55 drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are often decoys that Russia launches alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 29 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, over the past day. As a result of the attacks, one person was killed and six others were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Russian forces attacked Odesa Oblast and its regional center of Odesa with drones and ballistic missiles, according to Governor Oleh Kiper. During the attack, Russia targeted critical infrastructure in Odesa, causing power, water, and heat supply outages in the city. A Russian strike against the village of Lymanka on Odesa&apos;s outskirts killed a 77-year-old man, according to the statement. Russian aerial strikes also targeted an energy facility of Ukraine&apos;s largest private energy company, DTEK, in Odesa Oblast overnight, the company announced. This was the fourth Russian attack in two weeks on the oblast&apos;s power grid. In Donetsk Oblast, a Russian strike injured a civilian in the town of Pokrovsk, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Kharkiv Oblast, Russian forces attacked the village of Kozacha Lopan with a glide bomb, injuring a 41-year-old man, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-2-injure-7-over-past-day/	2025-03-05T00:31:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-05-09_31_48.jpeg
Zelensky, Macron, Starmer may visit Washington next week, media reports	President Volodymyr Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer might visit Washington as early as next week to present a &quot;united front&quot; on peace in Ukraine, the British tabloid Daily Mail reported on March 5, citing undisclosed diplomatic sources. The meeting would follow Zelensky&apos;s televised clash with U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, which derailed the planned signing of a mineral deal and preceded Washington&apos;s decision to halt military aid for Ukraine. Macron and Starmer, who visited Washington just days before Zelensky to sway Trump toward playing a role in Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability, have since then sought to mend the rift between Kyiv and the White House. &#xA0; On March 4, the same day he held a phone call with Starmer, Zelensky issued a statement in which he called the Oval Office clash &quot;regrettable&quot; while voicing readiness to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Zelensky also proposed initial steps toward peace, including the release of prisoners and a ceasefire in the air and sea, a proposal that was previously mentioned by Macron. During his address to Congress, Trump said he &quot;appreciates&quot; Zelensky&apos;s statement but made no direct comment on the aid freeze or the proposed truce. The leaders of Ukraine, France, and the U.K. are hoping to discuss the plan with Trump during their potential visit to Washington, the Daily Mail wrote. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Officials have not publicly commented on a possible trip of the three leaders to the U.S. The news comes as the Trump administration upends years of Washington&apos;s policy on Ukraine and Russia while casting doubt on its commitment to European security. Starmer and Macron have shaped up to be leading voices in the efforts to boost Europe&apos;s own defense capabilities and assistance for Ukraine, spearheading a plan to deploy thousands of peacekeepers in the country to monitor a potential ceasefire.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-macron-starmer-may-visit-washington-next-week-media-reports/	2025-03-04T23:59:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202256775.jpg
Russia launches counter-terrorist operation in Dagestan, kills 4, authorities claim	Russian authorities killed four militants overnight on March 5 in a counter-terrorist operation in Dagestan aimed against the Islamic State terrorist organization, Russia&apos;s National Anti-Terrorism Committee claimed. The militants &quot;were planning to commit a terrorist act at a facility of the regional administration of the Russian Interior Ministry in the (Dagestani) city of Kaspiysk,&quot; the committee said in a statement. &quot;There were no casualties among the civilian population or losses among law enforcement personnel.&quot; The statement came after reports of an attack by a group of unknown assailants against a police station in Makhachkala, the region&apos;s capital. A counter-terrorist operation was announced at 0:25 a.m. local time. Russia&apos;s predominantly Muslim Republic of Dagestan, lying in the North Caucasus, has seen a number of terrorist attacks by Islamic radicals and clashes with security forces over the past years. During one such attack in June 2024, 17 police officers and five civilians were killed, along with five perpetrators who opened fire against snagoygues and churches in the cities of Derbent and Makhachkala. Following the operation on March 5, Russian authorities claimed they had discovered grenade launchers, improvised explosive devices, grenades, machine guns, a pistol, and ammunition at the site of the skirmish and in a nearby cache. &quot;According to available data, the gang&apos;s activities were coordinated by members of the Islamic State,&quot; the committee said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Russia suffered one of its deadliest terrorist attacks in March 2024 when several assailants linked to the Islamic State opened fire in the Crocus City Hall near Moscow, killing 145 people.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-kills-4-in-counter-terrorist-operation-in-dagestan-authorities-claim/	2025-03-04T23:11:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-167533303.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 880,660 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 880,660 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on March 5. This number includes 1,250 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,256 tanks, 21,304 armored fighting vehicles, 39,512 vehicles and fuel tanks, 24,087 artillery systems, 1,306 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,094 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 27,849 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-880-660-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-03-04T22:42:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2166298605.jpg
Vance denies lack of Trump admin's pressure on Russia	U.S. Vice President JD Vance disputed on March 4 that the Trump administration was not pressuring Moscow to bring it to peace talks, arguing that the existing sanctions are straining Russia&apos;s economy. &quot;Well, I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s right, actually,&quot; Vance replied to a journalist who suggested that Washington is exerting pressure on Kyiv but not on Moscow. &quot;We still have a number of sanctions that are placed on Russians. We do believe the Russians, economically, are struggling because of this conflict.&quot; The comments came the same day that the U.S. froze crucial military assistance for Ukraine in an attempt to pressure Kyiv to the negotiating table. The decision came after a public dispute between President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and Vance in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, &#xA0;after which U.S. leaders berated the Ukrainian president for not being &quot;ready for peace&quot; and supposed lack of gratitude. The aid freeze raised concerns among Kyiv&apos;s other partners and was welcomed by the Kremlin, whose all-out war against Ukraine entered its fourth year. The U.S. has intensified diplomatic outreach to Moscow, holding two rounds of bilateral talks last month. The Trump administration has so far kept the sanctions against Russia imposed by the Biden administration in place, but the U.S. media reported that the White House is considering easing some of them as part of a peace process. &quot;We believe it is in Russia&apos;s best interest, and the United States&apos; and Ukraine&apos;s best interest, to bring this conflict to a close. We believe applying pressure to everybody to stop the killing. That&#x2019;s what the president&#x2019;s policy is,&quot; Vance said. Trump has not proposed any new sanctions against Russia and has praised his contacts with the Kremlin while adopting an increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Ukraine. Vance&apos;s comments came ahead of Trump&apos;s address to a joint session of Congress, during which the U.S. president reiterated the need to end the war as quickly as possible but made no direct mention of the aid freeze. Trump also said he appreciated Zelensky&apos;s statement in support of peace and claimed that both Russia and Ukraine are ready for talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/vance-disputes-lack-of-trump-admins-pressure-on-russia/	2025-03-04T22:36:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203259450.jpg
Lukashenko invites Trump, Zelensky, Putin to hold talks in Minsk	Minsk is prepared to host the leaders of the United States, Ukraine, and Russia for talks on ending Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko said in an interview on March 4. Lukashenko&apos;s remarks follow shortly after the U.S. imposed an immediate freeze on military aid to Ukraine, in a move the White House claimed was meant to pressure President Volodymyr Zelensky into entering peace negotiations. In an interview with American internet personality Mario Nawfal that aired on Belarusian state media, Lukashenko said he was willing to help U.S. President Donald Trump achieve his goal of brokering peace between Kyiv and Moscow. &quot;If you want, come here,&quot; he said, speaking to Nawfal in Minsk. &quot;It&apos;s only 200 kilometers from the Belarusian border to Kyiv. Half an hour by plane. You are welcome to come. We will sit down here. We&apos;ll come to an agreement quietly, without noise, without shouting. So tell Trump: I&apos;m waiting for him here, along with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and Zelensky. We&apos;ll sit down and calmly negotiate. If you want to make a deal.&quot; Despite the invitation, Lukashenko stressed that he did not want to act as a mediator between other nations. &quot;Most of all, I hate mediation. It means being between someone and pretending that you can do something,&quot; he said. Belarus previously hosted talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in 2014 and 2015, leading to the Minsk Agreements. The agreements were meant to stop the Donbas war, triggered by Russia&apos;s invasion of eastern Ukraine in 2014. Russia violated both agreements. Two days before launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Putin declared that the Minsk Agreements &quot;no longer existed.&quot; Zelensky brought up Russia&apos;s violation of prior agreements during his Oval Office meeting with Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance, in an attempt to explain the importance of concrete security guarantees for Ukraine. Trump and Vance responded by berating Zelensky, accusing him of being ungrateful for U.S. assistance. Days later, the U.S. halted military aid to Ukraine. In a joint address to both chambers of the U.S. Congress on March 4, Trump made little mention of the decision, but said he planned to work with &quot;both sides&quot; to stop the war in Ukraine. &#xA0; Belarus remains a staunch ally of the Kremlin. While it has not committed its own troops to the battlefield in Ukraine, it allowed the Russian military to use its territory and infrastructure extensively during the launch of the full-scale invasion. Zelensky claimed on Feb. 14 that Russia is once again building up troops in Belarus, possibly in preparation for large-scale operations against NATO countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-invites-trump-zelensky-putin-to-hold-talks-in-minsk/	2025-03-04T21:14:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1257742097.jpg
Do you want to keep it going for another 5 years?' — Trump on aid to Ukraine	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. President Donald Trump did not directly discuss his decision to halt military aid to Ukraine in his address to a joint session of Congress on March 4. Multiple news outlets on March 3 reported that the Trump administration ordered an immediate freeze on all U.S. military aid to Ukraine. &quot;The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine&apos;s defense,&quot; Trump said. &quot;With no security, with no anything. Do you want to keep it going for another five years?&quot; That question was Trump&apos;s only nod to the suspension of aid, which a White House official said on March 4 is meant to pressure &#xA0;President Volodymyr Zelensky into peace negotiations. Trump said in his address that he &quot;appreciate(s)&quot; Zelensky&apos;s recent statements expressing Ukraine&apos;s readiness for peace, but did not say whether or not the U.S. would resume weapons deliveries. Zelensky on March 4 reiterated Ukraine&apos;s commitment to the peace process in a post on X. &quot;Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians,&quot; &#xA0;he wrote. Zelensky proposed initial steps toward de-escalation with Russia, including prisoner of war (POW) releases, a &quot;truce at sea,&quot; and a &quot;truce in the sky&quot; that would ban missiles, long-range drones, and bombs targeting civilian infrastructure. He also said Ukraine is ready to sign the critical minerals deal &quot;at any time and in any convenient format.&quot; Trump said in his address to Congress that he received that same message in a letter from Zelensky. He added that his team was seeing &quot;strong signals&quot; from Russia indicating that Moscow is ready to make peace. While Trump&apos;s remarks on Ukraine and Russia were short on details, his comments indicated that he wants Europe to foot the bill for Ukraine&apos;s defense. &quot;Europe has spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending Ukraine,&quot; he said. The decision to halt aid came on the heels of a contentious meeting in the Oval Office between Zelensky, Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance. The U.S. leaders berated Zelensky for continuing to stress Ukraine&apos;s need for security guarantees, accusing him of being insufficiently grateful for American assistance. Zelensky was ordered to leave the White House, and departed without signing the much-anticipated minerals deal between the U.S. and Ukraine. Trump later claimed that Zelensky &quot;is not ready for peace.&quot; The suspension affects over $1 billion in arms and ammunition deliveries. It halts not only future aid but also weapons already in transit, including shipments on aircraft and ships, as well as equipment awaiting transfer in Poland. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed that the freeze had gone into effect, based on reports from the Ukrainian-Polish border. The White House has not specified what steps Ukraine must take to restore the flow of weapons. Trump&apos;s foreign policy moves in recent weeks signal a seismic shift in U.S. attitudes toward Ukraine, Russia, and Europe. Trump has conceded to Russian demands before negotiations even begin, initiated direct talks with Moscow while excluding Kyiv, and echoed Kremlin talking points &#x2014;&#xA0;including blaming Ukraine for starting the war and calling Zelensky a &quot;dictator.&quot; The Kremlin has applauded Trump&apos;s policy shift, saying it &quot;largely aligns&quot; with Russia&apos;s interests. Trump&apos;s address to Congress comes six weeks after the start of his second term in the White House. In a post to Truth Social late on March 3, Trump said he would use his address to &quot;tell it like it is.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-address-to-congress-aid-ukraine/	2025-03-04T19:55:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203340903.jpg
Top Democrats accuse Trump, Musk of endangering US security by siding with Russia	U.S. President Donald Trump is &quot;threatening the national security of our country,&quot; top Democratic lawmakers said in a statement issued March 4. The statement came hours before Trump is set to deliver a major address to a joint session of Congress, his first since returning to the White House on Jan. 20. &quot;Since taking office a little more than a month ago, the president has alienated nearly every international partner and ally we have, leaving us isolated in an increasingly dangerous world as Russia, North Korea, Iran, and China work together,&quot; the statement reads. &quot;We need partners and allies to effectively address the multitude of national security threats we face &#x2014; or could face. Yet, Trump has shown more alignment with Vladimir Putin, who threatens the international rules-based order, than with our long-standing partners and allies.&quot; The statement was signed by leading congressional Democrats on military, intelligence, and foreign policy committees. Its publication follows Trump&apos;s order to immediately halt all military aid to Ukraine. The statement harshly criticized the aid freeze, which it said &quot;appallingly demonstrated&quot; Trump&apos;s alliance with Moscow over Kyiv. Democrats also condemned billionaire Elon Musk for directing mass terminations of federal workers as the head of the Trump-created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The firings &quot;weakened our ability to respond to international crises,&quot; lawmakers said. The officials called on others to take action to defend U.S. security interests against threats from the administration. &quot;We are speaking out and urging others to join us before it&apos;s too late,&quot; the statement said. &quot;Because make no mistake &#x2014; this is a concerted effort by Trump and Musk to dismantle our system of government and exploit our weakness to consolidate power that benefits the very countries threatening our national security.&quot; The Trump administration&apos;s decision to suspend aid to Ukraine came on top of several recent Kremlin-friendly moves. Trump has undermined President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s legitimacy, falsely blamed Ukraine for starting the war, refused to label Putin a dictator, and sent delegates to talks with Russian officials without Ukraine&apos;s participation. The White House has also been considering lifting sanctions imposed against Russia for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/top-democrats-accuse-trump-musk-of-endangering-us-security-by-siding-with-russia/	2025-03-04T17:54:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2155468554.jpg
Russia’s airlines face growing crisis as sanctions strangle aircraft maintenance	Russia&#x2019;s civilian aviation sector is facing a severe crisis as Western sanctions block access to essential spare parts and maintenance services. With more aircraft suffering mechanical failures, Russian airlines are resorting to smuggling components from the U.S. and Europe to keep their fleets in the air, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Experts warn that without a steady supply of certified parts, Russia&#x2019;s commercial planes will soon become unsafe to fly. Since December 2024, the number of aviation incidents in Russia has surged. Between Dec. 1 and Jan. 20, Russian aircraft experienced 11 engine failures&#x2014;more than double the number from the previous two months. A growing number of flights have been forced to make emergency landings, with engine and landing gear malfunctions becoming routine. Many of these incidents involve Boeing and Airbus jets, which make up two-thirds of Russia&#x2019;s commercial fleet. Sanctions have made proper maintenance nearly impossible, leaving airlines with few options. Russian carriers can either ground aircraft that require critical safety inspections, take the risk of flying without proper maintenance, or smuggle parts from the West through third countries. U.S. authorities have been cracking down on these illegal supply chains, arresting individuals involved in smuggling schemes. The latest case, announced by the U.S. Department of Justice on Feb. 13, involved three employees of Flighttime Enterprises, an Ohio-based subsidiary of a Russian aircraft parts supplier. They were accused of illegally exporting $2 million worth of aviation components to Russia. Russia has tried to develop its own domestic aircraft, but even its flagship Sukhoi Superjet relies heavily on Western components. The government has ambitious plans to produce over 1,000 aircraft by 2030, including the MC-21 model, but experts say mass production is years behind schedule. Russian manufacturers lack the technology to replace key Western-made components, particularly in engines and avionics. Facing a worsening crisis, Moscow is looking to China for help. Beijing is developing its own aircraft engines and may eventually supply Russia with alternatives. However, experts believe a reliable replacement for Western aviation technology won&#x2019;t be available until at least 2029. Until then, Russian airlines will have to continue operating aging aircraft with limited maintenance&#x2014;raising serious safety concerns for passengers flying within the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-airlines-face-growing-crisis-as-sanctions-strangle-aircraft-maintenance/	2025-03-04T16:24:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Il-Russia.jpeg
Fox News correspondent claims no Trump mineral deal planned for today	U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly told Fox News on March 4 that there are no plans to sign a mineral resources deal with Ukraine following Donald Trump&#x2019;s speech to Congress. His statement comes after earlier reports suggesting Trump intended to announce the agreement during his upcoming address. President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s Feb. 28 visit to the White House was originally intended to finalize the long-debated agreement on jointly developing Ukraine&#x2019;s mineral resources. The meeting instead turned into a public clash, with Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance berating Zelensky. The Ukrainian president later left the White House without signing the deal. Following the talks, Trump accused Zelensky of &quot;disrespecting&quot; the U.S. in the Oval Office and said the Ukrainian president &quot;is not ready for peace.&quot; U.S. President told reporters on March 3 that a proposed economic deal between the U.S. and Ukraine remained on the table, but stressed that Zelensky needed to be more &quot;appreciative&quot; of U.S. support. When asked if the deal was off, Trump replied, &quot;I don&#x2019;t think so,&quot; adding that it would be beneficial for the U.S. and criticizing former President Joe Biden for sending $300 billion to Ukraine without receiving much in return. Trump also said that to restart negotiations, Zelensky must show more gratitude for U.S. assistance. On the same day, U.S. Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick said the U.S. and Ukraine are still making progress on a key mineral agreement that could strengthen long-term economic ties and pave the way for further security assistance. &quot;This mineral deal will be signed in short order, which will lead to a strong long-term economic partnership between the United States and Ukraine, and which will ultimately and naturally lead to security assistance,&quot; Fitzpatrick wrote. He also indicated that European nations would be expected to contribute, adding that they would face mandates to step up their support.	https://kyivindependent.com/fox-news-correspondent-claims-no-trump-mineral-deal-planned-for-today/	2025-03-04T14:59:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2202062036.jpg
Eutelsat in talks to expand satellite services for Ukraine amid Starlink uncertainty, FT reports	Eutelsat, the French satellite operator that owns Starlink rival OneWeb, is negotiating with European governments to expand satellite connectivity in Ukraine. The company announced on March 4 that it is working with European institutions and business partners and has equipment ready for rapid deployment to support critical missions and infrastructure in Ukraine, according to Financial Times. These discussions come as investors speculate that Eutelsat could step in if Ukraine loses access to Elon Musk&#x2019;s Starlink system. Concerns over Starlink&#x2019;s availability escalated after the U.S. paused military aid to Ukraine on March 3. Ukraine has relied heavily on Starlink for battlefield communications, making it a crucial component of its military operations. Last week, Reuters reported that U.S. officials had raised the possibility of restricting Ukraine&#x2019;s access to the system. Musk, who owns Starlink and has influence over U.S. President Donald Trump, denied the claim, calling the report false. Shares in Eutelsat surged as much as 123% to 4.50 euro before settling at a 70% gain, driven by investor confidence that European leaders will increase military support for Ukraine. The European Commission on March 4 proposed a 150 billion euro loan package to help EU member states finance defense procurement, which could facilitate immediate military aid to Kyiv. A spokesperson for the Commission confirmed that alternatives to Starlink were under consideration. Eutelsat&#x2019;s proposal involves combining OneWeb&#x2019;s low Earth orbit satellites, positioned around 1,200 kilometers above the surface, with its geostationary satellites at 35,000 kilometers. This dual-constellation approach could provide essential connectivity for Ukraine&#x2019;s military, including drone operations that have dealt significant blows to Russian forces. OneWeb already provides services to Ukraine through a German distributor, but expanding its role would require European governments to approve procurement and integration plans. Eutelsat acknowledged that the extent of its contribution depends on Ukraine&#x2019;s military requirements, security protocols, and existing communication systems.	https://kyivindependent.com/eutelsat-in-talks-to-expand-satellite-services-for-ukraine-amid-starlink-uncertainty-ft-reports/	2025-03-04T13:56:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/------Starlings.JPG
Ukraine’s DroneUA begins supplying robots to NASA	DroneUA, a Ukrainian distributor of unmanned systems, has started supplying robots to NASA, the company announced on March 4. The first test batch has already been sent to Virginia for trials, where experts will determine the most effective applications. NASA initiated the partnership, and DroneUA hopes it will lead to long-term cooperation. &quot;Testing our solutions in the United States paves the way for lasting collaboration with NASA. This proves that Ukrainian innovations are shaping the future,&quot; said Valerii Iakovenko, DroneUA&#x2019;s co-founder and managing partner. The company sees this partnership as an opportunity to strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s economy and expand its presence in global markets. Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov welcomed the development, emphasizing the importance of Ukrainian manufacturers supplying equipment abroad. &quot;Ukrainian technologies are effective everywhere&#x2014;on land, in water, and even in space. I am proud of our most talented developers. You are creating an innovative future,&quot; he wrote. Fedorov noted that Russia&apos;s war has rapidly advanced Ukraine&#x2019;s defense tech sector, accelerating technological innovation at an unprecedented pace.

Ukraine war latest: US suspends Ukraine military aid to pressure Zelensky into talks, Trump adviser says	Key developments on March 4: The U.S. has suspended military aid to Ukraine as part of a pressure campaign to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky toward negotiations with Russia, U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s senior adviser Jason Miller told CNN on March 4. &quot;President Trump is the only person, the only person talking about stopping the killing, and sometimes leaders can use the carrot, sometimes they can use the stick,&quot; Miller said. Several media outlets reported that Trump ordered an immediate halt to all military aid to Ukraine on March 4, affecting over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition deliveries. Miller claimed that Trump was using strong tactics to reinforce his demand for peace talks and that he expects Zelensky to &quot;get back to the table.&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed that American military aid had indeed been suspended, citing Polish border reports. &quot;This is an emergency,&quot; Tusk said. Polish Foreign Ministry spokesperson Pawel Wronski added that the U.S. had not consulted with any of its NATO allies before suspending the aid. The move follows a heated Oval Office meeting on Feb. 28 between Trump, Zelensky, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance, which ended with the cancelation of a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement. Since the meeting, some U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers have escalated their criticism of Zelensky, with some even suggesting he should resign. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, the U.S. has provided $119.8 billion in aid to Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, including $67.1 billion in military aid, $49 billion in financial aid, and $3.6 billion in humanitarian support. The U.S. and Ukraine are preparing to sign a mineral deal on March 4, according to Reuters, citing sources familiar with the matter. The sources indicated that U.S. President Donald Trump plans to announce the agreement during his upcoming address to Congress. However, they cautioned that the situation remains fluid and could still change. President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s Feb. 28 visit to the White House was originally intended to finalize the long-debated agreement on jointly developing Ukraine&#x2019;s mineral resources. The meeting instead turned into a public clash, with Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance berating Zelensky. The Ukrainian president later left the White House without signing the deal. Following the talks, Trump accused Zelensky of &quot;disrespecting&quot; the U.S. in the Oval Office and said the Ukrainian president &quot;is not ready for peace.&quot; Zelensky later called the fallout &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed Ukraine&#x2019;s readiness to sign the mineral and security agreement &quot;at any time and in any convenient format.&quot; The report comes after Trump reportedly ordered an immediate halt to more than $1 billion in U.S. military aid to Ukraine on March 4. Since the dispute, some Republican lawmakers have ramped up criticism of Zelensky, with some suggesting he may need to step aside. Zelensky&#x2019;s White House visit was preceded by weeks of tense negotiations as Ukraine rejected the initial two draft proposals, arguing they imposed one-sided obligations on Kyiv without any security commitments from Washington. The final agreement is expected to establish a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of the proceeds from the future monetization of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. Zelensky&#x2019;s refusal to sign the initial draft, presented by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Kyiv on Feb. 12, prompted the U.S. President to lash out publicly. Trump denounced Zelensky as a &quot;dictator,&quot; falsely accusing him of refusing to hold elections and echoing Kremlin disinformation about his legitimacy. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 4 that his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House &quot;did not go the way it was supposed to be,&quot; calling the fallout &quot;regrettable.&quot; The statement follows days of mounting pressure from Washington, with senior U.S. officials signaling that Zelensky should apologize for the heated Feb. 28 Oval Office exchange with Trump and Vice President JD Vance. The meeting ended without a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement being signed. Zelensky reaffirmed that Ukraine is ready to sign the agreement on minerals and security &quot;at any time and in any convenient format.&quot; &quot;We see this agreement as a step toward greater security and solid security guarantees, and I truly hope it will work effectively,&quot; he posted on X. Zelensky also responded to Trump&apos;s latest criticism of his comments on March 2, in which he described peace negotiations as being in the earliest stages and a final deal as &quot;very, very far away.&quot; Trump seized on the remarks as alleged proof that Zelensky does not want peace, posting on Truth Social that &quot;America will not put up with it for much longer.&quot; &quot;Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians,&quot; Zelensky said. He suggested that the initial steps toward de-escalation could include prisoner of war (POWs) releases, a &quot;truce in the sky&quot; banning missiles, long-range drones, and bombs targeting civilian infrastructure, as well as a &quot;truce at sea.&quot; &quot;Then we want to move very fast through all next stages and to work with the U.S. to agree a strong final deal,&quot; Zelensky added. The remarks come as several media outlets reported that Trump ordered an immediate freeze on all military aid to Ukraine on March 4, halting over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition deliveries. Trump&apos;s senior adviser, Jason Miller, told CNN that the aid suspension is part of a pressure campaign to push Zelensky into negotiations with Russia. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told Fox News on March 3 that Washington expects Zelensky to show &quot;regret&quot; for the Oval Office dispute and commit to signing the mineral deal. Ukrainian drones attacked an oil refinery in the city of Syzran in Russia&apos;s Samara Oblast overnight on March 4, Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation, said. The first explosions occurred around 3 a.m. local time, according to local residents. A fire broke out at the facility as a result. Samara Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev later said that drones attacked &quot;one of the Syzran industrial enterprises&quot; without providing more details. Russian forces downed drones, and there were no casualties, Fedorishchev claimed. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims. Drones attacked Russian Syzran oil refinery in Samara Region, locals report an explosion. A year ago, drones hit the same site, sparking a fire. No official details on the latest incident yet. pic.twitter.com/I0hJs85WW4 The Syzran Oil Refinery, lying around 700 kilometers (430 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border, was opened in 1942 and belongs to the Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft. The refinery has a capacity of 8.9 million tons of oil per year. It produces fuel, aviation kerosene, and bitumen, as well as processes crude oil from Western Siberia and Samara Oblast, according to Kovalenko. Drones earlier attacked the Syzran Oil Refinery on Feb. 19. Ukraine considers Russian oil facilities to be valid military targets, as fossil fuel profits supply Moscow&apos;s war machine. The Ukrainian military has launched repeated attacks against Russian refineries with long-range drones. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force struck a military facility near Troitskoye in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast on March 4, destroying dugouts and firing positions and killing up to 30 Russian military personnel, according to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff. The facility was reportedly used for planning attacks, including launching first-person-view (FPV) drones at Ukrainian positions. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s Defense Forces remain ready to continue operations targeting Russian military facilities until the Russia ceases its armed aggression against the Ukrainian people,&quot; the statement read. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially capturing about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukrainian forces have lost roughly half that area since, they recently advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in a new offensive. Over six months of fighting in the region, Russian casualties have reached nearly 40,000, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported in February. Ukraine is likely using its foothold in Kursk Oblast as leverage in potential peace talks. President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier that the offensive disrupted Russia&apos;s ability to conduct large-scale operations in northeastern and southern Ukraine. Russian forces in Kursk Oblast have been reinforced by North Korean troops, deployed last fall to counter Ukraine&apos;s cross-border operations. U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s heated Oval Office meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky signals a major shift in U.S. foreign policy, one that a Kremlin spokesman says &quot;largely aligns&quot; with Russia&#x2019;s interests. Trump&#x2019;s recent stance on Ukraine, including his public rebuke of Zelensky and reported halt on U.S. military aid to Kyiv, has drawn praise from Russian officials while raising concerns among European allies. Since taking office, Trump has distanced the U.S. from its traditional role as Ukraine&#x2019;s primary supporter, instead questioning Kyiv&#x2019;s commitment to peace and implying that Ukraine shares blame for the ongoing war. His administration&#x2019;s position has prompted Russian officials to express optimism about a potential thaw in U.S.-Russia relations. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state television on March 3 that &quot;the new administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations,&quot; calling the shift a positive development for Moscow. During the Oval Office meeting on Feb. 28, Trump and Vice President JD Vance accused Zelensky of failing to show gratitude for U.S. support and warned that his refusal to negotiate with Putin could escalate into a broader conflict. In response, European leaders reaffirmed their commitment to Ukraine, denouncing Russia&#x2019;s invasion and calling for continued Western military aid. The divergence in approach has raised questions about the future of U.S. support for Kyiv. Russian officials have openly praised Trump&#x2019;s stance, with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov calling him &quot;the first, and so far, the only Western leader&quot; to acknowledge what Moscow considers the true cause of the war. Other Kremlin figures, including the deputy chair of Russia&#x2019;s Security Council, applauded Trump for taking a harsher tone toward Zelensky, even labeling Ukraine&#x2019;s leader a &quot;dictator.&quot; Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that once the war ends, Washington and Moscow could pursue &quot;potentially historic economic partnerships,&quot; including cooperation on Arctic development and rare earth mining.

Trump's pivot toward Moscow met with joy in Russia	It&apos;s a good decision, says Kremlin&apos;s spokesman, following the U.S. pausing of all aid to Ukraine. &quot;The details remain to be seen, but if this is true, it is a decision that could indeed push the &apos;Kyiv regime&apos; towards a peace process,&quot; said Dmitry Peskov. Russia has been open about what it would require to begin peace talks: Ukraine&apos;s Crimea and four Ukrainian oblasts &#x2014; Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson &#x2014; none of which Moscow controls in full. U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered a suspension of all military aid to Ukraine overnight on March 4. The directive reportedly went into effect immediately, impacting over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition deliveries. &quot;Major!&quot; wrote Kirill Dmitriev, the CEO of Russia&apos;s state-run Direct Investment Fund, who became a vital link between the Kremlin and the White House. Dmitriev was one of the three top Russian officials taking part in the Feb. 18 U.S.-Russia negotiations in Riyadh. The move to suspend aid to Ukraine came on top of other Kremlin-friendly steps recently taken by the U.S. The Trump administration has also been considering lifting sanctions imposed against Russia for its brutal all-out war against Ukraine that killed hundreds of thousands. Meanwhile, Trump has also been aggressively attacking Ukraine and its leadership, which Russian officials and propagandists cheered. They backed Trump after he and Vice President J.D. Vance berated Zelensky in the Oval Office. Peskov said the U.S. policy now &quot;largely aligns&quot; with Russia&apos;s interests. Since President Trump began speaking favorably of Russia, often parroting Kremlin talking points, Russian officials and propaganda have drastically changed their rhetoric. If earlier a common theme on Russian television was an open threat to use nuclear weapons against the U.S., now state-run media outlets are talking more and more positively about the U.S. while continuing to issue xenophobic statements against Ukraine. &quot;Firewall between the U.S. and Russia is abolished. New America starts to reestablish relations with Russia. The new concert of two great powers with very similar anti-globalist illiberal ideologies is quite possible, but not certain,&quot; ultranationalist Alexander Dugin, a fervent supporter of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, wrote prior to Zelensky&apos;s meeting with Trump on Feb. 28. Russian political philosopher Alexander Dugin attends a memorial for his daughter Daria Dugina in Moscow, Russia, on Aug. 23, 2022. (Contributor/Getty Images)Russian officials and propaganda praised the U.S. vote against a Ukrainian resolution at the U.N. General Assembly, calling Russia an aggressor state. They also spoke in favor of Trump&apos;s controversial appointments and continued to spread false claims about Zelensky&apos;s legitimacy, which were picked up by Washington. In most of his recent posts, Russian propaganda mouthpiece Vladimir Solovyov has called Zelensky a &quot;former Ukrainian president, recognized as an illegitimate head of state.&quot; &quot;We were waiting for Trump not because he is pro-Russian but because he is pro-American,&quot; Solovyov said. Peskov welcomed the U.S. policy shift, saying on Feb. 26 that it was &quot;impossible to (even) imagine&quot; and that restoring relations would take a &quot;long way to go.&quot; The shift in Russian reaction became evident following Trump and Zelensky&apos;s altercation at the White House. Following the scuffle, Russian officials and propagandists jumped to Trump&apos;s defense. Their defense was paired with attacks against Zelensky and Europe. Solovyov said that Zelensky was &quot;chastised for rudeness&quot; and &quot;disgraced himself.&quot; Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev praised Trump for telling &quot;the truth,&quot; calling the argument &quot;a livid reprimand&quot; delivered to an &quot;ungrateful&quot; Zelensky.

(Artem Priakhin/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)He reiterated Trump&apos;s claim that Ukraine &quot;is gambling with World War III&quot; and said that military aid to Kyiv should be stopped. It stopped three days later. Medvedev, currently a deputy chairman of Russia&apos;s Security Council, has made numerous inflammatory statements on social media platforms and has openly challenged Ukraine&apos;s right to exist as an independent nation. Overall, Trump is enjoying a wave of support in Russia, which sees the U.S. president as a tool that would help force Ukraine into a peace deal beneficial to the Kremlin. &quot;Whoever in the U.S. attacks Putin and Russia today attacks Donald Trump,&quot; wrote Dugin.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-pivot-toward-moscow-met-with-joy-in-russia/	2025-03-04T12:22:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1245382772.jpg
Trump cuts to US weapons aid likely to hit Ukrainian civilians before front line	President Donald Trump&#x2019;s freeze on weapons is alarming Ukrainians, who look to U.S. air defense to stave off the worst of Russia&apos;s missile attacks. A White House representative on March 3 announced a &#x201C;pause&#x201D; on U.S. weapons aid to Ukraine following an ugly encounter between Trump, his Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last week. The directive is reportedly immediate and affects $1 billion in weapons aid, including what&#x2019;s already in transit, mostly through Poland. The details of what weapons exactly are affected by the decision are not entirely clear. Most U.S. shipments of lethal weapons and artillery to Ukraine have already been delivered. A number of U.S. vehicles remain under repair in Europe, but shipments have already slowed down radically in recent months, and Ukraine has moved on from U.S. dependence. For much of the weaponry that Ukraine needs to continue fighting, Europe could stand in for U.S. weapons, especially given the new political will to rearm the EU. But for air defense that protects Ukrainian cities from deadly Russian aerial attacks, nobody can replace the U.S. &#x201C;I think it will be sorely unpleasant, but that&#x2019;s not to say that this is stuff without which we&#x2019;ll lose the war tomorrow,&#x201D; says Serhiy, a drone pilot stationed in Kharkiv whose last name is not being disclosed for security reasons. &#x201C;But the situation in the rear will be noticeably worse since the big air defense covers the cities.&#x201D; Air defense helps protect Ukraine&#x2019;s local weapons production. It also keeps Russia from hitting power plants and civilian homes at will. &#x201C;It&#x2019;ll be harsh times, but we&#x2019;ll handle it,&#x201D; says another soldier by the callsign of &#x2018;Artem,&#x2019; whose real name is not being disclosed. &#x201C;It means more pressure on the cities and civilians.&#x201D; Civilians leave the site after a Russian ballistic missile hit the city center in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Dec. 20, 2024. (Vlada Liberova/Libkos/Getty Images)Per the State Department, the Biden administration oversaw the delivery of three Patriot and 12 NASAM air defense systems after the start of the full-scale war, along with a slew of other cheaper surface-to-air missiles and anti-drone weaponry. The Patriot system, in particular, is the only viable defense against Russian hypersonic Kinzhal missiles. The U.S. alone makes it, and can stop any deliveries from other countries who already have them. &#x201C;Securing a supply of Patriot missiles is our vulnerable spot,&#x201D; Dmytro Zhmailo, a Ukrainian military analyst, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Our mobile groups are demonstrating high efficiency with our, roughly speaking, small arms&#x201D; in shooting down drones, Zhmailo said. &#x201C;But Russian ballistic missiles, especially those that reach our cities within minutes, are still being intercepted by Patriot systems.&#x201D; Given stockpiling and replacement sourcing, Ukrainian officials are much more confident in their abilities on the front line than in aerial defense. Zelensky took to Twitter on March 4 calling on Trump to make a deal in which &#x201C;the first stages could be the release of prisoners and truce in the sky &#x2014; ban on missiles, long-ranged drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure &#x2014; and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same.&#x201D; Some observers are not so optimistic about Ukraine&apos;s capabilities on the front but still consider the military has months of stock. &#x201C;I would say that the impact of the U.S. suspension of military aid will be noticeable at the front in a month or two at the latest,&#x201D; estimated Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute. &#x201C;A suspension of intelligence cooperation and/or a decision to turn off Starlink services would have much more immediate and serious military effects.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s a threat that has been reported on previously but later denied by Elon Musk, the owner of company SpaceX that makes Starlink satellites. Patriot launcher modules pictured in a open field on Feb. 18, 2023 in Zamosc, Poland. (Omar Marques/Getty Images)U.S. intelligence on Russian movements, including the flow of information on missile launches and targeting of military sites, would also be tough to replicate. A source told CNN that the U.S. will continue to share intelligence with Ukraine despite Trump&apos;s decision, but whether that could change in the future is unclear. Trump&apos;s relationship with intelligence agencies is known to be frosty. The pause has, however, yet to graduate to a full stop. House Speaker Republican Mike Johnson called it &#x201C;temporary&#x201D; while speaking in D.C. on March 4. The pause appears to be mostly political pressure from Trump, who is eager to force Zelensky to make concessions in pursuit of a peace deal. But the Ukrainian president has continued to push for a deal that contains firm security guarantees for Ukraine in the event Russia launches a future attack. Trump is consequently playing off a potential rather than actual impact of a sudden cut in weapons shipment, says Ron Farkas, who runs logistics for weapons systems, including the F-16 through Poland. &#x201C;I would argue there hasn&#x2019;t been equipment coming in for some time. They&#x2019;re talking about cutting things that aren&#x2019;t happening. Everyone&#x2019;s out of stuff,&#x201D; &#xA0;Farkas told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not saying that there&#x2019;s not deliveries coming into Ukraine, I&#x2019;m just saying it&#x2019;s a slow trickle.&#x201D; &#x201C;If things were ending, I&#x2019;d start getting CVs in my inbox. I have not received a single stop work-order,&#x201D; says Farkas, comparing the cuts to USAID last month. The U.S. defense contractors looking to sell their weapons also have more weight over the current administration and Republicans in Congress. &#x201C;I find it very difficult to believe that they&#x2019;ll come in and cut Lockheed Martin contracts or cut Boeing contracts. Or (Musk&#x2019;s) Starlink contracts,&#x201D; Farkas said. Representatives for the U.S. State Department in Ukraine and for Ukrainian air defense declined to comment. The U.S. and Ukrainian Defense Departments did not return requests for comment.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-cuts-to-us-weapons-aid-likely-to-hit-ukrainian-civilians-before-front-line/	2025-03-04T11:31:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202602648.jpg

People should not be guessing' — Zelensky calls for clear dialogue with US on military aid amid freeze	President Volodymyr Zelensky instructed Ukraine&#x2019;s defense minister, intelligence chiefs, and diplomats on March 4 to reach out to the U.S. to clarify the future of American military assistance. &quot;People should not be guessing. Ukraine and America deserve a respectful dialogue and a clear position of each other,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address. His call comes after reports that U.S. President Donald Trump ordered an immediate halt to more than $1 billion in U.S. military aid to Ukraine on March 4. Zelensky mentioned that military aid was briefly paused in late January before being restored, referencing a Reuters report from February that tied the pause to policy debates within the White House. &quot;This is not 2022; now our resilience is higher, and we have means of defense, but normal partnership relations with America are important for us to really end the war,&quot; he said. Zelensky also warned that Moscow had not changed its stance, asserting that Russia would demand a reduction of Ukraine&#x2019;s army, a renunciation of territories, and a significant weakening of Ukraine&#x2019;s political structure. House Speaker Mike Johnson said on March 4 that the suspension of aid is a &quot;temporary pause&quot; and linked it to the fallout from Zelensky&apos;s Oval Office exchange with Trump. The meeting on Feb. 28 ended without signing a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement. U.S. officials have increased pressure on Zelensky, with some calling for an apology for the White House dispute. Zelensky earlier called the fallout &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed Ukraine&apos;s readiness to sign the mineral and security agreement &quot;at any time and in any convenient format.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/people-should-not-be-guessing-zelensky-orders-officials-to-clarify-future-of-us-military-aid-to-ukraine/	2025-03-04T11:25:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/98f74e298d34967cffe22f79a708f597_1741111431.jpeg
Russian fighter jet provokes French Reaper drone over Mediterranean, French Defense Minister says	A Russian Su-35 fighter jet engaged in a dangerous provocation against a French Reaper drone over the Mediterranean Sea on March 2, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu reported on March 4. &quot;The Russian Su-35 fighter jet behaved dangerously toward the French Reaper drone...

In December, two Dutch F-35 fighter jets intercepted Russian aircraft over the Baltic Sea, according to the Netherlands Defense Ministry. Russian military aircraft frequently operate without transponders or flight plans over the Baltic and Black Seas, maneuvers often seen as testing NATO&apos;s response capabilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-fighter-jet-confronts-french-reaper-drone-in-mediterranean-france-reports/	2025-03-04T10:48:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1229478705.jpg

Ukraine to boost gas imports due to Russian attacks on energy infrastructure, Bloomberg reports	Ukraine plans to import about 3.5 billion cubic meters of gas for the upcoming heating season due to ongoing Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure, Bloomberg reported on March 4. Recent Russian missile and drone strikes have significantly reduced Ukraine&apos;s gas production capacity, forcing the country to rely more heavily on imports to meet domestic demand. Damage to infrastructure has caused production drops of up to 40% at times. &#x201C;We are waiting for a final approval of the balance, which will define the projected volume of consumption, extraction, and imports of gas,&#x201D; Roman Chumak, acting CEO of Ukraine&apos;s state-owned oil and gas company Naftogaz, told Bloomberg. The country&#x2019;s gas buying plans come amid a volatile market marked by high competition and elevated prices due to Europe&#x2019;s need to replenish low gas inventories. In February, Ukraine imported 560 million cubic meters of gas from Europe, compared to just 700 million cubic meters for the entire previous heating season, Bloomberg reported, citing estimates from Kyiv-based Dragon Capital. Due to Russian strikes and extreme cold in February, Ukraine&#x2019;s gas production sharply declined, leading Naftogaz to urgently purchase significant amounts of natural gas from the European Union to meet critical heating demands. Tensions between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump could potentially weaken Ukraine&apos;s ability to defend against Russian attacks, raising concerns about energy security, according to Bloomberg. Naftogaz and Ukrainian energy company DTEK confirmed to Reuters that Russian forces attacked and damaged their facilities twice in February. At the start of 2025, Ukraine halted its agreement with Russia to transport Russian gas to European customers through its pipelines, as the deal expired at the end of 2024 and was not renewed.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-boost-gas-imports-due-to-russian-attacks-on-energy-infrastructure-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-04T09:39:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-821523200.jpg
US military aid freeze to Ukraine temporary, linked to Zelensky-Trump clash	The pause in U.S. military aid to Ukraine is temporary and tied to the fallout from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s heated Oval Office exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson said on March 4. &quot;It&apos;s a temporary pause,&quot; Johnson said during a press briefing when asked about the reported freeze on over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition deliveries. The move follows a heated Feb. 28 Oval Office meeting between Trump, Zelensky, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance, during which the two American leaders berated Zelensky. The meeting ended without a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement being signed. Since then, senior U.S. officials have repeatedly suggested that Zelensky should express regret for the confrontation. Johnson said Zelensky should &quot;make right what happened last week, the shocking developments in the Oval Office.&quot; &quot;If he does that (signs the minerals deal), I think this is the win-win-win scenario for everybody involved,&quot; he added. Zelensky, in a statement earlier on March 4, called the outcome of the Oval Office meeting &quot;regrettable&quot; and emphasized Ukraine&apos;s readiness to sign the minerals deal &quot;at any time and in any convenient format.&quot; Trump&apos;s senior adviser, Jason Miller, told CNN that the aid freeze is part of a broader pressure campaign to push Zelensky toward peace talks with Russia. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz previously said Washington expects Zelensky to show &quot;regret&quot; for the Oval Office clash and commit to finalizing the deal.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-military-aid-freeze-to-ukraine-is-temporary-linked-to-trump-zelensky-exchange-speaker-johnson-says/	2025-03-04T09:21:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2150335295.jpg
Why Trump’s Ukraine aid freeze upends world order	The U.S. has suspended military aid to Ukraine as part of a pressure campaign to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky toward negotiations with Russia, U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s senior adviser Jason Miller said on March 4. It&#x2019;s just the latest in a series of developments since Trump took office that mark a dramtic shift in the U.S.&#x2019;s relationship with not only Ukraine, but Europe, and the rest of the world. The Kyiv Independent spoke with Timothy Ash, associate fellow at the Chatham House&#x2019;s Russia and Eurasia Programme, who told us that what is unfolding right now amount to &#x201C;teutonic shifts in alliances that I don&#x2019;t think anyone could quite have imagined.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/why-trumps-ukraine-aid-freeze-upends-world-order/	2025-03-04T09:14:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/Ash-4.jpg
Zelensky says White House clash 'regrettable,' proposes steps for peace	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 4 that his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House &quot;did not go the way it was supposed to be,&quot; calling the fallout &quot;regrettable.&quot; The statement follows days of mounting pressure from Washington, with senior U.S. officials signaling that Zelensky should apologize for the heated Feb. 28 Oval Office exchange with Trump and Vice President JD Vance. The meeting ended without a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement being signed. Zelensky reaffirmed that Ukraine is ready to sign the agreement on minerals and security &quot;at any time and in any convenient format.&quot; &quot;We see this agreement as a step toward greater security and solid security guarantees, and I truly hope it will work effectively,&quot; he posted on X. Zelensky also responded to Trump&apos;s latest criticism of his comments on March 2, in which he described peace negotiations as being in the earliest stages and a final deal as &quot;very, very far away.&quot; Trump seized on the remarks as alleged proof that Zelensky does not want peace, posting on Truth Social that &quot;America will not put up with it for much longer.&quot; &quot;Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians,&quot; Zelensky said. He suggested that the initial steps toward de-escalation could include prisoner of war (POWs) releases, a &quot;truce in the sky&quot; banning missiles, long-range drones, and bombs targeting civilian infrastructure, as well as a &quot;truce at sea.&quot; &quot;Then we want to move very fast through all next stages and to work with the U.S. to agree a strong final deal,&quot; Zelensky added. The remarks come as several media outlets reported that Trump ordered an immediate freeze on all military aid to Ukraine on March 4, halting over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition deliveries. Trump&apos;s senior adviser, Jason Miller, told CNN that the aid suspension is part of a pressure campaign to push Zelensky into negotiations with Russia. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told Fox News on March 3 that Washington expects Zelensky to show &quot;regret&quot; for the Oval Office dispute and commit to signing the mineral deal.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-says-white-house-regrettable-vows/	2025-03-04T08:44:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201830448.jpg
Russian forces in Kharkiv sector suffer more fatalities than wounded, Ukraine says	Russian forces in the Kharkiv sector of the front line have suffered more irrecoverable losses than wounded over the past month, Volodymyr Degtyaryov, spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s &quot;Khartia&quot; brigade, said on March 4. &quot;If you look at the enemy&apos;s losses in February, you can see an interesting trend &#x2014; more dead than wounded. Perhaps this is due to the fact that they have less movement and more (personnel) concentrations,&quot; Degtyaryov told Ukrainian media Suspilne. He noted that Russian forces rarely use vehicles, as Ukrainian troops have established a &quot;dead zone&quot; extending 10 kilometers into Russian-occupied areas, allowing Ukrainian forces to maintain control over the sector from the air. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. &quot;Of course, they have offensive potential, but we are doing everything we can to prevent them from doing so,&quot; Degtyaryov added. The situation in Kharkiv Oblast as of March 4, 2025. The area marked in red is the territory occupied by Russia. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Kharkiv Oblast, which shares a direct border with Russia, remains a major flashpoint in the ongoing war. Moscow launched an offensive in the region on May 10, 2024, advancing up to 10 kilometers (6 miles) before Ukrainian defenders halted the push at the first line of defense. During the first month of the offensive, Russian forces suffered around 4,000 casualties, including both killed and wounded, according to Ukraine&apos;s military. Despite their losses, Russian troops still control several villages on two axes in Kharkiv Oblast &#x2014; one near Lyptsi and the other near the embattled town of Vovchansk.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-in-kharkiv-sector-suffer-more-irrecoverable-losses-than-wounded-brigade-spokesperson-says/	2025-03-04T08:04:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1494251171-1.jpeg
Russian oil deliveries to Czech Republic via Druzhba pipeline suspended, Czech official says	Russian oil deliveries to the Czech Republic via the Druzhba pipeline have been halted, Czech news channel CT24 reported on March 4, citing Industry and Trade Minister Lukas Vlcek. &quot;We control the situation and are prepared for such circumstances. Refineries in the Czech Republic are well prepared, and the state material reserve system is reliable, so I can assure everyone that there are enough oil reserves for both households and businesses,&quot; Vlcek said. No mention was made of the cause for the halt in deliveries. The Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline transports Russian oil to Europe through two main branches: the southern route supplies Central Europe, and the northern route serves Northern Europe. This is not the first disruption to Druzhba&apos;s oil flow. In early December 2024, supplies were temporarily halted but resumed after two days. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala announced in January that Prague intends to completely stop Russian oil imports via Druzhba. The country plans to rely instead on the Transalpine Pipeline, which has been modernized to boost supply volumes. The European Union imposed an embargo on Russian oil and oil products in June 2023, though the southern branch of Druzhba was temporarily exempted. That exemption expires in June 2025, after which recipient countries must find alternative supply routes.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-oil-deliveries-to-czech-republic-via-druzhba-pipeline-halted-czech-minister-says/	2025-03-04T07:36:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-94281707.jpg
US continues intelligence sharing with Ukraine despite military aid freeze, CNN reports	The U.S. continues to share intelligence with Ukraine despite President Donald Trump&#x2019;s suspension of military aid, CNN reported on March 4, citing a source familiar with the matter. Since the start of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion, the U.S. has provided Kyiv with real-time intelligence, including satellite imagery and sensitive information on Russian troop movements. As of the morning of March 4, this support remained unchanged, according to CNN&apos;s source. The report comes as multiple media outlets reported that Trump ordered an immediate halt to all U.S. military aid to Ukraine on March 4, affecting more than $1 billion in weapons and ammunition deliveries. Trump&apos;s senior adviser, Jason Miller, told CNN that the aid freeze is part of a pressure campaign to push President Volodymyr Zelensky toward negotiations with Russia. &quot;Sometimes leaders can use the carrot, sometimes they can use the stick,&quot; Miller said. The decision follows a heated Feb. 28 Oval Office meeting between Trump, Zelensky, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance, during which the two American leaders berated Zelensky. The meeting ended without a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement being signed. Since the confrontation, some U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers have escalated their criticism of Zelensky, with some even suggesting he should resign. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told Fox News on March 3 that the U.S. administration expects Zelensky to show regret and commit to signing the mineral deal. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, the U.S. has provided Ukraine with $119.8 billion since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, including $67.1 billion in military assistance, $49 billion in financial aid, and $3.6 billion in humanitarian support.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-continues-sharing-intelligence-with-ukraine-despite-trumps-aid-freeze-media-reports/	2025-03-04T07:18:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/--------------2024-03-19-202210.png
US suspends Ukraine military aid to pressure Zelensky into talks, Trump adviser says	The U.S. has suspended military aid to Ukraine as part of a pressure campaign to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky toward negotiations with Russia, U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s senior adviser Jason Miller told CNN on March 4. &quot;President Trump is the only person, the only person talking about stopping the killing, and sometimes leaders can use the carrot, sometimes they can use the stick,&quot; Miller said. Several media outlets reported that Trump ordered an immediate halt to all military aid to Ukraine on March 4, affecting over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition deliveries. Miller claimed that Trump was using strong tactics to reinforce his demand for peace talks and that he expects Zelensky to &quot;get back to the table.&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed that American military aid had indeed been suspended, citing Polish border reports. &quot;This is an emergency,&quot; Tusk said. Polish Foreign Ministry spokesperson Pawel Wronski added that the U.S. had not consulted with any of its NATO allies before suspending the aid. The move follows a heated Oval Office meeting on Feb. 28 between Trump, Zelensky, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance, which ended with the cancelation of a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement. Since the meeting, some U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers have escalated their criticism of Zelensky, with some even suggesting he should resign. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, the U.S. has provided $119.8 billion in aid to Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, including $67.1 billion in military aid, $49 billion in financial aid, and $3.6 billion in humanitarian support.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-suspends-ukraine-military-aid-to-pressure-zelensky-into-talks-trump-adviser-says/	2025-03-04T06:35:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201194454.jpg
Russia agrees to help US in negotiations with Iran over nuclear program, Bloomberg reports	Moscow has pledged to help Washington in dealing with Iran over the Islamic Republic&apos;s nuclear program and its support for regional anti-American proxies, Bloomberg reported on March 4, citing its undisclosed sources. Since returning to the White House, Trump has been trying to restore relations with Russia, which were severed under the previous administration when the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Trump voiced his interest in negotiations with Iran to Putin during a phone call in February. A few days later, the U.S. and Russian delegations discussed this issue during talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Bloomberg reported. Moscow has long been partners with Tehran, but their cooperation only intensified after the outbreak of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine in 2022. Iran has provided Russia with thousands of Shahed drones used in attacks against Ukrainian cities, as well as short-range ballistic missiles. With Iran&apos;s assistance, Russia has begun producing its own variants of Shahed drones called Geran-2. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said earlier that Russia believes the U.S. and Iran should &quot;resolve all problems through negotiations,&quot; and Moscow is &quot;ready to do everything in its power to achieve this goal.&quot; When asked whether Russia offered to mediate between Tehran and Washington, Esmail Baghai, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said that it was &quot;natural&quot; for countries to offer their assistance. &quot;Given the importance of these issues, it is quite possible that many parties will show goodwill and willingness to help in solving various problems,&quot; Baghai said during a televised press conference in Tehran on March 3. &quot;From this point of view, it is only natural that countries will offer assistance if it is needed,&quot; he added. Since taking office, Trump has distanced the U.S. from its traditional role as Ukraine&apos;s primary supporter, instead questioning Kyiv&apos;s commitment to peace and implying that Ukraine shares the blame for the ongoing war. Russian officials have openly praised Trump&apos;s stance, with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov calling him &quot;the first, and so far, the only Western leader&quot; to acknowledge what Moscow considers the true cause of the war. Other Kremlin figures, including the deputy chair of Russia&apos;s Security Council, applauded Trump for taking a harsher tone toward President Volodymyr Zelensky, even labeling Ukraine&apos;s leader a &quot;dictator.&quot; Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that once the war ends, Washington and Moscow could pursue &quot;potentially historic economic partnerships,&quot; including cooperation on Arctic development and rare earth mining.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-agrees-to-help-us-in-negotiations-with-iran-over-nuclear-program-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-04T05:43:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-872780694.jpg
US military aid to Ukraine suspended according to Polish border reports, Tusk says	The Trump administration halted military aid to Ukraine, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on March 4, citing Polish border reports, Rzeczpospolita reported. Several media outlets reported earlier that U.S. President Donald Trump had ordered the suspension of military aid, including the aid that was already on its way to Ukraine. &quot;Today we have no reason to believe that these are just words. Reports coming from the border, from our center in Jasionka, confirm the statements of the American side,&quot; Tusk said. Tusk called the situation &quot;an emergency&quot; and insisted on full mobilization and concentration of joint efforts to resolve it.&quot;The situation is serious and requires special concentration from the government. We will make decisions that will require the full solidarity of the state and your (Ukrainian) ministries,&quot; Tusk said.&quot;The days and weeks are coming when it is absolutely necessary to stop empty discussions, prestige disputes, coalition disagreements, because we will have to make decisions in a mode that is, in a sense, extraordinary,&quot; he added.According to Pawel Wronski, Polish foreign ministry spokesperson, the U.S. has not consulted with any of its NATO allies about suspending military aid to Ukraine. The suspension of U.S. military aid followed a spat between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Trump in the Oval Office last week. The argument between two leaders also resulted in the failure to sign a minerals deal.Since the meeting, some U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers have escalated their criticism of Zelensky, with some even suggesting he should resign.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-military-aid-to-ukraine-suspended-according-to-polish-border-reports-tusk-says/	2025-03-04T04:09:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183928589.jpg
I'm full of anger' — Ukraine awakes to a nightmare as US freezes military aid	Even in a country grimly accustomed to negative news, the headlines that Ukraine woke up to on March 4 still came as a shock &#x2014; the U.S. is freezing military aid. &quot;It hurts to watch it unfolding,&quot; Volodymyr Dubovyk, the head of Odesa National University&apos;s Center for International Studies, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We can scrap everything that we previously knew about U.S. foreign policy.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump on March 3 reportedly ordered a suspension of all military aid to Ukraine, with a senior Defense Department official telling Bloomberg it is on hold until Trump determines that Ukrainian leaders are making a genuine effort toward peace. Neither Washington nor Kyiv have officially confirmed the freeze. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that the reports the Polish government gets from the Ukrainian-Polish border confirm the freeze. The move is the latest from the White House as it escalates pressure on President Volodymyr Zelensky, just days after a heated exchange in the Oval Office cast doubt on U.S. support for Kyiv, and ended in the cancelling of a planned mineral deal between the two countries. The Trump administration&apos;s strongarm tactics against Zelesnky are being felt especially painfully in Ukraine as the Kremlin appears to be getting a free ride from a White House which &#x2014; by the Kremlin&apos;s own admission &#x2014; is now largely aligned with Russia&apos;s interests. &quot;It looks as if Trump is trying to cut a deal with Russia at the cost of the weaker party, which is Ukraine,&quot; Oleksandr Merezhko, a lawmaker and chair of the parliament&apos;s foreign affairs policy, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;I don&#x2019;t see that Trump is using leverage against the aggressor, he is using leverage against the victim of the aggression. To stop military aid to Ukraine right now means to help Russia kill Ukrainians with impunity.&quot; Trump has long-promised he could swiftly end the war in Ukraine as soon as he took office, though his original pledge of &quot;24 hours&quot; was amended to &quot;100 days&quot; shortly before his inauguration. During his first week in office, Trump appeared to come out on the side of Ukraine, putting the onus on Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and threatening &quot;high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions&quot; if he didn&apos;t &quot;make a deal.&quot; But in the weeks since, and after a phone call between Trump and Putin, the rhetoric coming from the White House towards Ukraine has been increasingly hostile and has, at times, resembled that coming from the Kremlin. Trump has described Zelensky as a &quot;dictator&quot; and questioned his legitimacy, with some Republican lawmakers this week calling for him to resign. Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, lawmaker for the Holos (Voice) party, told the Kyiv Independent that even though the tone has changed, he believes Trump&apos;s more recent actions still align with his original stated goal of ending the war swiftly &#x2014; but regardless of the cost for Ukraine. &quot;I think that it&#x2019;s a continuation of Trump&#x2019;s policy to end the war as soon as possible by effectively giving up on Ukraine&#x2019;s interests,&quot; he said. &quot;Because based on the logic of his and his administration&#x2019;s statements, their goal is peace at any cost. But for Ukraine, such an option is not acceptable.&quot; The directive to freeze U.S. military aid reportedly goes into effect immediately, impacting over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition. The pause affects not only future aid but also weapons already in transit, including shipments on aircraft and ships, as well as equipment awaiting transfer in Poland. &quot;I&apos;m full of anger,&quot; &#x2018;Bart,&#x2019; a Special Operations Forces sniper fighting in the hot spot near Pokrovsk, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;America has sided with Russia, North Korea, and Iran, they have chosen the side of darkness. If the U.S. has chosen to play the role of world policeman, it is its duty to protect world democracy.&quot; Yet despite the anger and the future of weapons supplies in doubt, Ukrainian soldiers who spoke to the Kyiv Independent remain confident in their ability to fight back against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. &quot;There is no panic in the army,&quot; &quot;Fuko&quot; who serves with Ukraine&apos;s 66th Prince Mstyslav Khorobyi Brigade said, adding: &quot;We are ready to keep going as long as it takes. &quot;Moreover, the weapons supply crisis can be avoided if our European allies respond quickly and help us with the supply of the most important weapons.&quot; Bart acknowledged the aid freeze &quot;will have some impact, but not a critical one.&quot; &quot;Europe is helping us, we will break through &#x2014; Russia is running out of steam, and we need to push on,&quot; he added. As Ukraine increasingly looks to Europe for support, there were signs on March 4 that Brussels was preparing to step up. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the ReArm Europe plan aimed at strengthening the defense capabilities of the EU&#x2019;s countries, which could unlock close to 800 billion euros ($842 billion). &quot;Europe is ready to assume its responsibilities,&quot; von der Leyen said, adding: &quot;This is a moment for Europe and we are ready to step up.&quot; Whether or not Europe can step up in time to fill the potential hole left by the U.S.&apos; withdrawal remains to be seen, and Ukraine will be assessing which areas of its defense could be impacted the most. &quot;Our main challenge is air defense which depends on U.S. support,&quot; Lieutenant Colonel Bohdan Krotevych told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We must urgently find an alternative because civilians will die if we run out of missiles.&quot; Krotevych added that the Trump administration needs to understand this too, otherwise they are &quot;setting themselves up for prison sentences.&quot; &quot;When? Whether it happens after his current term or through impeachment is for the American people to decide,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/im-full-of-anger-ukraine-awakes-to-a-nightmare-as-us-freezes-military-aid/	2025-03-04T04:00:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198359955.jpg
US military aid continue to flow as of evening of March 3, Prime Minister Shmyhal says	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. U.S. military aid continued to flow to Ukraine as of late last night, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on March 4 during his press conference in Kyiv. The statement comes after several media outlets reported that U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered a suspension of all military aid to Ukraine on March 4. The directive reportedly went into effect immediately, impacting over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition deliveries.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-military-aid-continue-to-flow-as-of-evening-of-march-3-ukraines-prime-minister-shmyhal-says/	2025-03-04T03:41:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168960387.jpg
Oil prices continue to decline amid growing tensions between US, Ukraine, Reuters reports	Oil prices have continued to drop after U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly suspended military aid to Ukraine, Reuters reported on March 4. The news from the U.S. comes after a spat between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last week. Neither Washington nor Kyiv have officially confirmed the freeze. Brent crude oil futures fell 54 cents, or 0.75%, to $71.08 per barrel. In the meantime, futures for U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil decreased by 36 cents, or 0.53%, to $68.01 per barrel, according to the news agency. The market perceived the distancing of the U.S. and Ukraine as a signal of a possible easing of the war, subsequently leading to the loosening of sanctions against Russia and the return of additional volumes of Russian oil for purchase, Reuters reported. Yet Goldman Sachs analysts noted that Russian oil exports are now more limited by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) quotas than by sanctions, so even if sanctions are eased, a significant increase in supplies is not guaranteed. OPEC&apos;s decision to extend the planned increase in production by 138,000 barrels per day, the first increase since 2022, also puts pressure on prices. A day earlier, oil prices fell by about 2%, hitting a 12-week low, amid news about Ukraine and concerns that new U.S. tariffs will hurt global economic growth, according to Reuters. Trump&apos;s 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico will come into effect on March 4, with energy products from Canada subject to a 10% duty, while tariffs on Chinese goods will rise from 10% to 20%.	https://kyivindependent.com/oil-prices-continue-to-decline-amid-growing-tensions-between-us-ukraine-reuters-reports/	2025-03-04T03:23:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/taneco.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 2, injure 11 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed two civilians and injured 11 others over the past day, regional authorities reported on March 4. Russian forces launched 99 drones from the Russian cities of Orel, Kursk, Bryansk, Millerovo, and Primosk-Akhtarsk at Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 65 drones over Kharkiv, Sumy, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Odesa, Kirovohrad, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, the Air Force said. Another 32 drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are often decoys that Russia launches alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense. In Donetsk Oblast, a Russian attack killed a person in the town of Pokrovsk, while another Russian strike injured a person in the village of Nova Poltavka, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian forces attacked the village of Omelnyk with a glide bomb, killing a 49-year-old man. His wife suffered injuries in the strike, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 30 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, over the past day. As a result of the attacks, five people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. In Odesa Oblast, four people were injured in the attack against the regional center of Odesa, according to Governor Oleh Kiper. Three people suffered shrapnel wounds and broken limbs, while another person suffered a concussion.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-2-injure-11-over-past-day/	2025-03-04T03:05:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2147527243.jpg

Ukrainian drones reportedly strike oil refinery in Russia's Samara Oblast	Ukrainian drones attacked an oil refinery in the city of Syzran in Russia&apos;s Samara Oblast overnight on March 4, Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation, said. The first explosions occurred around 3 a.m. local time, according to local residents. A fire broke out at the facility as a result. Samara Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev later said that drones attacked &quot;one of the Syzran industrial enterprises&quot; without providing more details. Russian forces downed drones, and there were no casualties, Fedorishchev claimed. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims. Drones attacked Russian Syzran oil refinery in Samara Region, locals report an explosion. A year ago, drones hit the same site, sparking a fire. No official details on the latest incident yet. pic.twitter.com/I0hJs85WW4 The Syzran Oil Refinery, lying around 700 kilometers (430 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border, was opened in 1942 and belongs to the Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft. The refinery has a capacity of 8.9 million tons of oil per year.

Pentagon denies halting cyber operations against Russia, Bloomberg reports	The Pentagon has denied that U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a halt to cyber operations against Russia, Bloomberg reported on March 4, citing an unnamed senior defense official. The Record previously reported that U.S. Cyber Command was ordered to suspend offensive cyber and information operations against Moscow. The news coincided with President Donald Trump&apos;s efforts to negotiate an end to Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine under terms that critics argue favor Moscow. Cybersecurity experts had warned that such a move would benefit one of America&apos;s most persistent cyber adversaries, potentially weakening U.S. leverage in both cyber and conventional military operations. Russian hacker groups have engaged in various forms of cyber warfare throughout the full-scale war, including cyberattacks against Ukraine, hacks of civilian infrastructure in Europe, and interference in foreign elections. But according to a source quoted by Bloomberg, Hegseth did not cancel or suspend cyber operations against Russia. Nor has he issued any orders to reverse this priority, the source said. The U.S. Cyber Command oversees 135 teams of &quot;cyber mission forces.&quot; The units involved in offensive operations are cyber combat mission teams, according to Bloomberg.	https://kyivindependent.com/pentagon-denies-halting-cyber-operations-against-russia-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-03T23:41:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193880159.jpg

Ukraine brings back 7 children from occupied territories, Russia	Seven Ukrainian children have been returned home under the President of Ukraine&#x2019;s initiative, Bring Kids Back UA, according to Daria Zarivna, Director of the initiative and advisor to the Head of the Office of the President. The children had been residing in the Russian-occupied territories and Russia itself. Since February 2022, at least 20,000 Ukrainian children have been abducted from Russian-occupied areas and transferred to other Russian-controlled territories or to Russia, according to the Ukrainian national database, &quot;Children of War.&quot; Among the returned children is a boy who, along with his parents, lived under occupation for an extended period, Zarivna wrote on March 3. &quot;He endured forced passportization, psychological pressure at school, and a constant fear for his future,&quot; she added. &quot;In an effort to provide him with the opportunity for an education in a free country, his parents decided to bring him to Ukrainian-controlled territory.&quot; Ukraine considers the abduction of these children a war crime and argues that these actions meet the U.N.&#x2019;s legal definition of genocide. Russia, however, claims that the children are being relocated for their protection from conflict zones. Ukrainian authorities, including Children&#x2019;s Ombudswoman Daria Herasymchuk, estimate that up to 300,000 children have been unlawfully deported, while the figure put forth by Lubinets, the Ukrainian Human Rights Commissioner, stands at 150,000. The Ukrainian government has managed to return 1,233 children so far, according to the Ministry of Reintegration. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Children&apos;s Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, citing their involvement in the unlawful transfer of Ukrainian children. Russia dismissed the ICC&#x2019;s decision as &quot;outrageous and unacceptable.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-brings-back-7-children-from-russia-occupied-territories/	2025-03-03T21:48:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/dscf6830-1668456828oat5c.jpg
Kremlin welcomes Trump’s policy shift as US moves 'align' with Russia's interests	U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s heated Oval Office meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky signals a major shift in U.S. foreign policy, one that a Kremlin spokesman says &quot;largely aligns&quot; with Russia&#x2019;s interests. Trump&#x2019;s recent stance on Ukraine, including his public rebuke of Zelensky and reported halt on U.S. military aid to Kyiv, has drawn praise from Russian officials while raising concerns among European allies. Since taking office, Trump has distanced the U.S. from its traditional role as Ukraine&#x2019;s primary supporter, instead questioning Kyiv&#x2019;s commitment to peace and implying that Ukraine shares blame for the ongoing war. His administration&#x2019;s position has prompted Russian officials to express optimism about a potential thaw in U.S.-Russia relations. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state television on March 3 that &quot;the new administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations,&quot; calling the shift a positive development for Moscow. During the Oval Office meeting on Feb. 28, Trump and Vice President JD Vance accused Zelensky of failing to show gratitude for U.S. support and warned that his refusal to negotiate with Putin could escalate into a broader conflict. In response, European leaders reaffirmed their commitment to Ukraine, denouncing Russia&#x2019;s invasion and calling for continued Western military aid. The divergence in approach has raised questions about the future of U.S. support for Kyiv. Russian officials have openly praised Trump&#x2019;s stance, with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov calling him &quot;the first, and so far, the only Western leader&quot; to acknowledge what Moscow considers the true cause of the war. Other Kremlin figures, including the deputy chair of Russia&#x2019;s Security Council, applauded Trump for taking a harsher tone toward Zelensky, even labeling Ukraine&#x2019;s leader a &quot;dictator.&quot; Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that once the war ends, Washington and Moscow could pursue &quot;potentially historic economic partnerships,&quot; including cooperation on Arctic development and rare earth mining.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-welcomes-trumps-policy-shift-as-us-moves-align-with-russias-interests/	2025-03-03T20:53:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1255667814.jpg
Vance says US door open if Zelensky willing to 'seriously talk peace'	As U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly halted all military aid to Ukraine, Vice President JD Vance once again criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky in a March 3 interview with Fox News, claiming Zelensky has shown a &quot;clear unwillingness to engage in the peace process&quot; &#x2014; a policy Trump insists reflects the will of the American people. During the Oval Office meeting on Feb. 28, Zelensky, Trump and Vance held a 45-minute-long press briefing in the Oval Office which ended in a heated argument about American aid to Ukraine, and canceling of the planned signing of the U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement. Trump and Vance accused Zelensky of failing to express gratitude for U.S. support and warned that his refusal to make concessions to Putin was a dangerous gamble that could escalate into World War III. Following the meeting, Trump said that Zelensky &quot;is not ready for peace.&quot; &quot;He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for peace,&quot; Trump posted on Truth Social on Feb. 28. Vance told Fox News&apos; Sean Hannity that &quot;what President Trump has said clearly and consistently is of course (that) the door is open so long as Zelensky is willing to seriously talk peace.&quot; &#xA0; &quot;You can&apos;t come into the Oval Office or anywhere else and refuse to even discuss the details of a peace deal,&quot; he said. &quot;This is not going to make anybody happy. The Russians are going to have to give up stuff, the Ukrainians are going to have to give up stuff. You can&apos;t come to the Oval Office and say &apos;give us security guarantees, we won&apos;t even engage with you about what we are willing to give up.&apos; That&apos;s been the Ukrainian posture.&quot; &quot;Hope is not a strategy. Throwing money and ammunition at a terrible conflict &#x2014; that is not a strategy,&quot; Vance said on the Biden adminstration policy on Ukraine. The U.S. has provided assistance worth $119.8 billion since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, including $67.1 billion in military aid, $49 billion in financial aid, and $3.6 billion in humanitarian aid, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Following the tense meeting with Trump, Zelensky told Fox News on Feb. 28 that Ukraine is &quot;ready for peace but we need to be in a good position.&quot; &quot;We want peace... that&apos;s why I visited President Trump,&quot; Zelensky told Fox News, adding that he hopes that Trump would show stronger support for Ukraine rather than positioning himself as a mediator in the war. He emphasized that Russia was the aggressor, having launched the invasion. &quot;I want really him to be more at our side,&quot; Zelensky said. Vance reiterated to Hannity that President Trump will be &quot;the first person to pick up the phone&quot; once Zelensky is ready to talk about peace. &quot;The president is actually taking a much more realistic perspective in saying this can&apos;t go on forever, we can&apos;t fund this thing forever, the Ukrainians can&apos;t fight forever &#x2014; so let&apos;s bring this thing to a peaceful settlement.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/vance-says-us-door-open-if-zelensky-willing-to-seriously-talk-peace/	2025-03-03T18:49:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199662300.jpg

BREAKING: Trump halts military aid to Ukraine, media reports	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered a suspension of all military aid to Ukraine, escalating pressure on President Volodymyr Zelensky mere days after a heated exchange in the Oval Office cast doubt on U.S. support for Kyiv. A senior Defense Department official told Bloomberg that all U.S. military assistance to Ukraine is on hold until Trump determines that Ukrainian leaders are making a genuine effort toward peace. The pause affects not only future aid but also weapons already in transit, including shipments on aircraft and ships, as well as equipment awaiting transfer in Poland. The decision follows a contentious meeting between Trump and Zelensky, where disagreements over military aid and Ukraine&#x2019;s strategic stance fueled tensions. Following the meeting, Trump said that Zelensky &quot;is not ready for peace.&quot; &quot;He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for peace,&quot; Trump posted on Truth Social on Feb. 28. The White House has not specified what steps Ukraine must take to restore the flow of military aid, leaving uncertainty over the timeline and conditions for its resumption.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-halts-military-aid-to-ukraine-media-reports/	2025-03-03T16:00:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179841418.jpg
Europe’s major powers consider seizing frozen Russian assets in ceasefire talks, FT reports	France, Germany, and the UK are exploring ways to seize over 200 billion euro ($210 billion) in frozen Russian assets as part of efforts to negotiate a ceasefire in Ukraine, officials familiar with the discussions told Financial Times (FT). While Berlin and Paris had previously resisted full asset confiscation, they are now engaging in talks with European and G7 partners about potential mechanisms to use the funds. A proposal discussed by French officials suggests seizing the assets if Moscow violates a future ceasefire agreement, ensuring security guarantees for Kyiv. Diplomatic activity has intensified in recent weeks, with France and the U.K. leading efforts to draft a European peace plan. These discussions gained momentum after U.S. President Donald Trump launched direct negotiations with Russia aimed at ending the war. Since 2022, G7 nations have frozen roughly 300 billion euro ($310 billion) in Russian central bank assets, with the majority&#x2014;around 190 billion euro ($200 billion) &#x2014;held in Belgium&#x2019;s Euroclear. Currently, only the interest generated by these funds is being used to back a $50 billion loan package for Ukraine, while the principal remains untouched. Ukraine, Poland, and the Baltic states have long pushed for the full confiscation of these assets, but major European capitals had resisted over concerns about international legal precedents and financial stability. The European Central Bank had warned that such a move could undermine confidence in the euro as a reserve currency, given that most of the frozen assets are euro-denominated. However, shifting political dynamics appear to be changing the debate. French President Emmanuel Macron recently told Trump that immediate seizure would not align with international law but suggested the assets could be part of post-war negotiations. Meanwhile, Germany&#x2019;s likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has signaled openness to asset seizure and is coordinating with outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz ahead of an EU summit. In the U.K., Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed that London is examining ways to deploy the funds, noting that while profits from Russian sovereign assets are already being used to support Ukraine, the fate of the principal remains complex.	https://kyivindependent.com/europes-major-powers-consider-seizing-frozen-russian-assets-in-ceasefire-talks-ft-reports/	2025-03-03T14:59:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1240065587.jpg
Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick claims US-Ukraine mineral deal to be signed	The United States and Ukraine are making progress on a key mineral agreement that could strengthen long-term economic ties and pave the way for further security assistance, according to U.S. Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick. Fitzpatrick, who represents Pennsylvania and serves as the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Energy, the Environment, and Cyber, announced the development on social media following a conversation with Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to President Volodymyr Zelensky. He described the discussion as &quot;lengthy and productive&quot; and expressed confidence that the deal would be finalized soon. I just had a lengthy and productive one-on-one conversation with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x2019;s Chief-of-Staff, Andrii Yermak. We are 100% getting this train back on the tracks. This mineral deal will be signed in short order, which will lead to a strong long-term economic&#x2026; &quot;This mineral deal will be signed in short order, which will lead to a strong long-term economic partnership between the United States and Ukraine, and which will ultimately and naturally lead to security assistance,&quot; Fitzpatrick wrote. He also indicated that European nations would be expected to contribute, adding that they would face mandates to step up their support. The specifics of the agreement remain unclear, but Ukraine&#x2019;s vast reserves of lithium and other rare earth minerals have drawn increasing interest from Western nations. These resources are critical for modern technologies, including batteries, electronics, and defense applications. Fitzpatrick&apos;s comment follows Zelensky&apos;s early departure from Washington on Feb. 28 without signing a U.S.-Ukraine mineral deal after a tense confrontation with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance at the White House. In the days since, some U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers have escalated criticism of Zelensky, with some suggesting he should resign.	https://kyivindependent.com/rep-brian-fitzpatrick-claims-us-ukraine-mineral-deal-to-be-signed/	2025-03-03T13:48:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201332404.jpg
Trump administration weighs sanctions relief for Russia, Reuters reports	The United States is preparing a proposal to potentially ease sanctions on Russia as President Donald Trump works to restore diplomatic ties and negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, a U.S. official and another source familiar with the discussions told Reuters. The White House has directed the State and Treasury departments to compile a list of sanctions that could be lifted. U.S. officials plan to use this list in upcoming talks with Russian representatives as part of a broader strategy to improve economic and political relations with Moscow. Sanctions officials are now drafting a proposal that would remove restrictions on specific Russian individuals and entities, including oligarchs, the sources said. While internal government offices routinely prepare such options, the White House&#x2019;s direct request signals a serious consideration of sanctions relief as part of a potential agreement with the Kremlin. The administration has not specified what it expects in return. Trump has moved quickly to shift U.S. policy on Russia. He called Russian President Vladimir Putin on Feb. 12, then sent U.S. representatives to meet with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia and Turkey. In January, Trump had warned that he would increase sanctions if Moscow refused to negotiate an end to the war. However, members of his administration have since acknowledged the possibility of lifting economic restrictions. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in a Feb. 20 interview with Bloomberg Television, suggested that Russia could see sanctions relief depending on its approach to negotiations. Trump himself told reporters on Feb. 26 that easing sanctions remained an option. The White House requested a potential sanctions relief plan before Trump extended a state of emergency last week over the war in Ukraine, the sources said. The state of emergency, first imposed in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea, allows the U.S. government to sanction individuals and organizations involved in the war. Despite Russia&#x2019;s ability to sustain a wartime economy through increased military spending and industrial production, experts say it remains vulnerable and in need of Western relief. The Kremlin has expressed interest in economic cooperation, particularly in rare earth metals. Putin recently suggested potential collaboration with the U.S. in that sector. Trump has also sought a minerals deal with Ukraine, which has significant lithium and rare earth metal reserves, as a way to offset the billions of dollars in American aid. However, his meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28 ended without an agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-administration-weighs-sanctions-relief-for-russia-reuters-reports/	2025-03-03T12:57:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1252236776.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Trump to discuss potential suspension of military aid for Ukraine	Key developments on March 3: U.S. President Donald Trump will discuss on March 3 the possible suspension or complete cancellation of military aid to Ukraine, including weapons pledged by the Biden administration, The New York Times (NYT) reported, citing an undisclosed source. The news comes after Trump&apos;s public spat with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House on Feb. 28 that upended plans to sign a natural resources treaty between the two countries. An unnamed administration official told the NYT that Trump will meet on March 3 with his top national security aides, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, to review and potentially act on a range of policy options for Ukraine. Among the issues to be considered will be the suspension or cancellation of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, including the latest shipments of ammunition and equipment authorized during the Biden administration, the official said. Zelensky has repeatedly urged the U.S. to continue shipping arms to Ukraine to strengthen Kyiv&apos;s position in future peace negotiations with Russia. The Trump administration has not authorized new weapons shipments for Ukraine but has not halted those that were announced under the previous Biden administration. Reuters reported in early February that opposing factions within the administration had been debating whether the U.S. should continue providing weapons. The U.S. has provided Ukraine with $65.9 billion in military aid since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on March 2 that a number of European nations, including the U.K. and France, are developing a &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; that will include &quot;planes in the air and boots on the ground&quot; in an effort to negotiate a successful ceasefire in Ukraine. Starmer added that for any coalition to succeed, Europe must &quot;have strong U.S. backing.&quot; &quot;(European allies) will go forth to develop a &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; to defend a deal in Ukraine and to guarantee the peace,&quot; Starmer said during a press conference following a European leaders&apos; summit in London. &quot;Not every nation will feel able to contribute, but that can&apos;t mean we sit back. Instead, those willing will intensify planning now with real urgency.&quot; &quot;The U.K. is prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air. Together with others, Europe must do the heavy lifting,&quot; Starmer said. &quot;This is not a moment for more talk... If you want to preserve the peace, you have to defend the peace.&quot; Ukraine remains committed to working with the U.S. and European partners to secure peace and expects continued American support, Zelensky said on March 3. &quot;It is very important that we try to make our diplomacy really substantive to end this war the soonest possible,&quot; Zelensky posted on X. The statement comes after U.S. President Donald Trump lashed out at Zelensky for telling British media that a peace deal with Russia remains &quot;very, very far away.&quot; Trump called it &quot;the worst statement that could have been made&quot; and accused Zelensky of not wanting peace &quot;as long as he has America&apos;s backing.&quot; Zelensky countered that Ukraine needs real peace and that no one wants it more than Ukrainians, as the war continues to devastate cities and claim lives. &quot;Peace is needed as soon as possible,&quot; he said. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration wants to hear from Zelensky that he regrets the Oval Office clash, U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told Fox News on March 3. &quot;What we need to hear from President Zelensky is that he regrets what happened, that he&apos;s ready to sign this minerals deal, and that he&apos;s ready to engage in peace talks,&quot; Waltz said. Zelensky&apos;s visit to the White House on Feb. 28 was intended to finalize a long-debated agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine on jointly developing Ukraine&apos;s mineral resources. The press conference instead turned into a public clash, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance berating Zelensky. The Ukrainian president later left the White House without signing the deal. Following the talks, Trump accused Zelensky of &quot;disrespecting&quot; the U.S. in the Oval Office and said the Ukrainian president &quot;is not ready for peace.&quot; Waltz also claimed the confrontation proved that the Ukrainian president was not serious about peace negotiations. &quot;But here&apos;s the problem: time is not on his (Zelensky&apos;s) side. Time is not on the side of indefinitely continuing this conflict. The American people&apos;s patience is not unlimited. Their wallets are not unlimited. Our stockpiles and munitions are not unlimited,&quot; he said. Waltz suggested that Zelensky was jeopardizing Ukraine&apos;s long-term economic ties with the U.S. He said, &quot;He could leave the White House with the U.S. and Ukraine bound together economically for a generation.&quot; Following the exchange, some Republican lawmakers have ramped up criticism of Zelensky, with some even suggesting he may need to step aside. House Speaker Mike Johnson told NBC News on March 2 that Zelensky &quot;needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude, or someone else needs to lead the country.&quot; Waltz himself took aim at Zelensky in an interview with far-right Breitbart News on March 1, comparing him to &quot;an ex-girlfriend that wants to argue everything that you said.&quot; As U.S. officials continue to lambast the Ukrainian president over the incident, European allies gathered in London on March 2 to reaffirm their support for Zelensky and the embattled country. Russian forces struck a Ukrainian military training ground in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast on March 1 during a formation exercise, Mykhailo Drapatyi, commander of the Ground Forces of Ukraine, said on March 3. A day earlier, reports of a Russian attack with an Iskander-M ballistic missile on a training ground in the village of Cherkaske near the regional center of Dnipro began circulated on social media. The strike was allegedly carried out after an Orlan drone spotted a formation of soldiers about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the front line. Drapatyi did not disclose the number of Ukrainian soldiers killed and injured. He added that the truth about the attack could be hidden &quot;in the fog of bureaucracy&quot; but promised to prevent this. &quot;A tragedy at a training ground is a terrible consequence of an enemy strike. The war requires quick decisions, responsibility, and new safety standards; otherwise, we will lose more than we have,&quot; Drapatyi said. Drapatyi added he had launched an investigation into the circumstances of the strike and appointed an independent review with the participation of military counterintelligence. &quot;Everyone who made decisions that day, and everyone who did not make them on time, will be held accountable. No one will hide behind explanations or formal reports,&quot; he said. Later, on March 3, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said the head of the unit training center that was hit and the commander of the military unit had been suspended from duty. &quot;In the middle of the day, on March 1, the enemy attacked one of the military units on the territory of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine training ground in the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast,&quot; he said. &quot;As a result of the hit of the Iskander-M ballistic missile equipped with cluster munitions, there are dead and wounded,&quot; he added. Also on March 3, Ukraine&apos;s State Bureau of Investigation announced it was opening criminal proceedings into the &quot;death and injury of Ukrainian servicemen as a result of a Russian missile strike on a training ground in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.&quot; This is not the first time Russia has attacked Ukrainian troops while they are lining up in the rear. On November 3, 2023, in a village near the front line in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian forces attacked a group of soldiers. As a result of the Russian missile strike, 19 soldiers of the 128th Brigade and two civilians were killed. According to an investigation by Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry, the soldiers were gathered in the courtyard of a house during an awards ceremony while all camouflage rules were ignored. The Russian army is trying to break through the Russia-Ukraine border in Sumy Oblast and cut Ukrainian forces off from its logistics routes, State Border Guard spokesperson Andrii Demchenko said on March 3 on national television. Demchenko&apos;s statement comes after Russian forces attempted to cross the Russia-Ukraine border in Sumy Oblast near the village of Novenke but were repelled the previous week. Northeastern Sumy Oblast borders Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukrainian forces launched an incursion last summer to draw away Moscow&apos;s troops from Donbas and disrupt Russian plans for an offensive from the north. Demchenko said Russia is attempting to enter Ukrainian territory with assault groups in the direction of the village of Novenke, which lies just across the border, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the regional center, Sumy. The Ukrainian army is making every effort to prevent Russian units from gaining a foothold on Ukrainian territory, Demchenko said, adding that Russian troops mainly use &quot;large numbers of equipment and personnel&quot; in Kursk Oblast to achieve a breakthrough. &quot;These are not mass assaults. When the enemy tries to drive the Ukrainian Defense Forces out of Kursk Oblast, firstly, it puts pressure on our units within Kursk Oblast,&quot; Demchenko said. &quot;And then, it (Russia) is trying to expand the area of active combat activities, trying to enter the territory of Ukraine. However, all elements of the Defense Forces are operating in that area to prevent this. All available weapons are being used,&quot; he added. Russia plans to launch at least 500 drones per aerial attack against Ukraine, Vadym Skibitsky, the deputy head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), said in an interview with RBC Ukraine published on March 3. Both Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology throughout the war, significantly altering modern warfare tactics. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Russia has launched thousands of cheap but effective drones at Ukraine. Russia currently uses 150 to 200 drones per attack against Ukraine, which occur on a daily basis, but Russian forces plan to increase their capabilities to 500, Skibitsky told RBC Ukraine. Russia also plans to increase the number of sites from which drones will be launched. Russian forces have significantly increased domestic production of various types of drones, according to Skibitskyi. Russia uses combat and reconnaissance drones, as well as so-called &quot;decoys,&quot; which are drones without a payload, he added. &quot;All of this simply overloads our air defense system. It is very difficult to distinguish between a drone flying with a warhead and one without,&quot; Skibitsky said.

Sanctions, shrinking exports spark crisis in Russia's coal industry, media reports	Western sanctions and shrinking export opportunities in Asia have triggered a severe crisis in Russia&apos;s coal industry, particularly in Kemerovo Oblast, the country&apos;s key coal-producing region, the Moscow Times reported on March 3. &#xA0; Kemerovo Oblast, or Kuzbass, which accounts for 60% of Russia&apos;s hard coal production and 80% of its coking coal, has been hit the hardest. Financial troubles have forced eight coal companies in the region to halt operations, leaving hundreds of miners without pay for months, according to Kemerovo Governor Ilya Seredyuk. &quot;Falling prices on world markets, problems with logistics, a shortage of personnel, and a high key rate &#x2014; along with Western sanctions &#x2014; have created a serious challenge for the coal industry,&quot; Seredyuk said. Russia has attempted to shift coal exports to Asia after losing access to Western markets, but demand has declined. In 2023, Indian coal imports from Russia fell by 37%, while Chinese imports dropped by 13%. As a result, total coal exports from Kuzbass fell by 10.4%, and regional production declined by 7.3% to 198.4 million tons (396 million pounds). Despite Moscow&apos;s deepening economic ties with Beijing, Western sanctions have become an increasing hurdle to Russian-Chinese trade, further compounding financial losses and bankruptcies in Russia&apos;s coal sector.	https://kyivindependent.com/sanctions-shrinking-exports-spark-coal-crisis-in-russias-kemerovo-region-media-reports/	2025-03-03T11:47:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1234072071.jpg
Why is Ukraine not accepted into NATO?	NATO membership for Ukraine is becoming increasingly elusive. The previous U.S. administration has been silently opposing extending a NATO invitation to Ukraine. The current U.S. administration has made its opposition public. &quot;You can forget about (NATO membership). That&apos;s probably the reason the whole thing (war) started,&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 26 when asked about the potential settlement between Ukraine and Russia. Such a policy by Ukraine&apos;s main backer has raised eyebrows in the past. It doesn&apos;t anymore. For decades, Russian officials and propaganda have been using NATO enlargement as a justification for the Kremlin&apos;s hostile action toward the country&apos;s neighbors, including its wars against Ukraine and Georgia. Despite the U.S. and other NATO member states giving a variety of reasons why they have been against welcoming Ukraine to the military alliance, experts the Kyiv Independent spoke to said the only real reason for keeping Kyiv out is Moscow&apos;s stance on the issue. &quot;The Biden administration was always fearful of escalation in the conflict with Russia. The Trump administration has its own reasons, probably linked to any deal it&apos;s trying to strike with Moscow on a ceasefire,&quot; Mark Webber, non-resident associate fellow at the NATO Defense College, told the Kyiv Independent. NATO follows &quot;an open door&quot; policy, meaning that a new country can be invited to join the alliance with the consent of all 32 members. The requirements for future candidates include support for democracy, development of a market economy, civilian control of the armed forces, respect for the sovereignty of other countries, and work on interoperability with NATO forces. The first step to joining the alliance is receiving a Membership Action Plan (MAP) with recommendations for the candidate country. In 2008, Ukraine applied to receive the MAP and was able to secure the backing from U.S. President George W. Bush. Yet, under increased pressure from Russian President Vladimir Putin, the alliance members, primarily Germany and France, rejected Ukraine&apos;s aspirations to join NATO. Kyiv returned to the path of Euro-Atlantic integration years later, after Russia launched its war against Ukraine, occupying Crimea and parts of the country&apos;s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.

(Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Before the start of the war, most Ukrainians didn&apos;t support joining a military union and preferred their country to remain a neutral state. Following the start of the war, NATO membership was supported by the majority of the population, peaking at over 80% following the start of the all-out war in 2022. In late 2022, Ukraine applied for an accelerated accession to the alliance, and in 2023, NATO leaders ruled that Kyiv could become a member without the need for a Membership Action Plan. Yet, Kyiv wasn&apos;t invited to join, unlike Finland and Sweden that are also in close proximity to Russia. &quot;Ukraine is seemingly unusual in that it is a large, important pro-NATO country, which wants to join the alliance but has not generated consensus amongst it to be admitted,&quot; Webber said. NATO members could also be restrained by the level of potential obligations to a country that joined the alliance while it is at war and by the provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty on collective defense, enshrined in Article 5, according to the expert. The article suggests that an attack on one member is an attack on all member states, however, it doesn&apos;t clearly define the actions that member states are obligated to take. Among the reasons Ukraine was denied membership in the past were the lack of transparency in defense procurement and the allegedly high level of corruption in the country, as the Biden administration hinted previously. Yet Webber said NATO has already been joined by countries with &quot;a poor record when it comes to corruption.&quot; &quot;Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania joined NATO and the European Union, even though I think it would be fair to say that their political, economic system and even the management of defense procurement had a whiff of corruption about it,&quot; Webber said. &quot;I think it&apos;s probably an excuse that is used (against Ukraine),&quot; he added. &quot;Ultimately, the geostrategic problem and the fear of antagonizing Russia is the most significant obstacle.&quot; This opinion is shared by Stefan Wolff, professor of international security at the University of Birmingham. &quot;Russia, arguably, feels more threatened by Ukrainian NATO membership because (Vladimir) Putin clearly cannot accept that Ukraine &apos;turns against&apos; Russia and because Ukraine, unlike Finland or Sweden, is integral to Putin&apos;s vision of a Russian sphere of influence,&quot; Wolff said. Russia attempted to justify its invasion of Ukraine by an alleged threat from NATO, among other reasons. Now, the Kremlin is putting a ban on Ukraine to ever joining NATO among its main demands for concluding a potential peace agreement to end the war it had started. Several NATO members, including the U.K., France, Italy, Poland, and the Baltic states, have supported Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO, calling it an essential security guarantee. Yet, two key members, U.S. and Germany, as well as Hungary and Slovakia, have declared that they do not support this step. &quot;Germany has traditionally been cautious when it comes to upsetting opinions in Russia,&quot; Webber said. It&apos;s difficult to predict whether this position will change under Friedrich Merz, who is set to become Germany&apos;s next chancellor in the upcoming months. Merz has been seen as a pro-Ukrainian politician, recently calling for transferring German-made long-range Taurus missiles to Ukraine, which Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been hesitant to do. Regarding Slovakia and Hungary, experts agree that with prime ministers Robert Fico and Viktor Orban in office, it would be hard to push those countries to support an invitation to Ukraine. Bratislava and Budapest continue to argue that Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO will lead to an escalation with Russia. The main obstacle would, of course, be Washington, with the current administration signaling that Ukraine is not welcome to join an alliance or to receive any sort of security guarantee. At the same time, Wolff noted that joining NATO may not meet Kyiv&apos;s expectations on security guarantees. &quot;The key question, to which nobody really has an answer at the moment, is whether, under Trump, the deterrent effect of Article 5 still has any credible meaning. If it doesn&apos;t, then joining the alliance would not give Ukraine the security it deserves,&quot; Wolff said.	https://kyivindependent.com/why-is-ukraine-not-accepted-into-nato/	2025-03-03T11:25:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1534871526.jpg
Ukraine committed to work with US, Europe to end war 'the soonest possible,' Zelensky says	Ukraine remains committed to working with the U.S. and European partners to secure peace and expects continued American support, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 3. &quot;It is very important that we try to make our diplomacy really substantive to end this war the soonest possible,&quot; Zelensky posted on X. The statement comes after U.S. President Donald Trump lashed out at Zelensky for telling British media that a peace deal with Russia remains &quot;very, very far away.&quot; Trump called it &quot;the worst statement that could have been made&quot; and accused Zelensky of not wanting peace &quot;as long as he has America&apos;s backing.&quot; Zelensky countered that Ukraine needs real peace and that no one wants it more than Ukrainians, as the war continues to devastate cities and claim lives. &quot;Peace is needed as soon as possible,&quot; he said. The exchange follows Zelensky&apos;s abrupt departure from Washington on Feb. 28 after a heated confrontation with Trump and Vice President JD Vance in the Oval Office. The meeting was supposed to finalize a U.S.-Ukraine mineral deal but ended in public disagreements, with Zelensky being attacked for allegedly not showing gratitude for America&apos;s support. Since the meeting, some U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers have escalated their criticism of Zelensky, with some even suggesting he should resign. Trump is set to discuss on March 3 the possible suspension or cancellation of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, including weapons pledged under President Joe Biden&apos;s administration, the New York Times reported, citing an undisclosed source.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-committed-to-work-with-us-europe-to-end-war-as-soon-as-possible-zelensky-says/	2025-03-03T11:07:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/9df0f2bc886489a36fc11986974a930d_1686065778.jpeg
The worst statement' — Trump criticizes Zelensky for saying peace deal with Russia is far away	U.S. President Donald Trump criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky on March 3 for saying that a peace deal with Russia remains &quot;very, very far away.&quot; Zelensky made the remark in a March 2 interview with British media, saying that negotiations were in the earliest stages and that a settlement with Moscow remains a distant prospect. &quot;This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky, and America will not put up with it for much longer,&quot; Trump posted on Truth Social. Trump seized on the statement, using it as alleged evidence that Zelensky does not want peace. &quot;This guy doesn&apos;t want there to be peace as long as he has America&apos;s backing,&quot; Trump wrote, claiming that European leaders had told Zelensky they &quot;cannot do the job without the U.S.&quot; The comments follow Zelensky&apos;s early departure from Washington on Feb. 28 without signing a U.S.-Ukraine mineral deal after a tense confrontation with Trump and Vice President JD Vance at the White House. In the days since, some U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers have escalated criticism of Zelensky, with some suggesting he should resign. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told Fox News on March 3 that the U.S. administration expects Zelensky to show regret and commit to signing the mineral deal. Trump is set to discuss on March 3 the possible suspension or cancellation of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, including weapons pledged under the Biden administration, the New York Times reported, citing an undisclosed source.	https://kyivindependent.com/the-worst-statement-trump-criticizes-zelenskys-peace-remarks-claims-us-wont-tolerate-it/	2025-03-03T10:32:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201188116.jpg
Ukrainians react to Trump-Zelensky clash	In the wake of the Feb. 28 clash between U.S. President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office, the Kyiv Independent went to the streets of Kyiv to ask Ukrainians what they think of the now infamous meeting.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-react-to-trump-zelensky-clash/	2025-03-03T10:17:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/VoxPops--2--min.jpg
5 ways you can support Ukraine — even if your government doesn't want to	Editor&#x2019;s note: We originally shared a version of this guide for our members on Feb. 24, 2024. If you would like to join a community of people united by wanting to help Ukraine, consider becoming a member today. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s public spat with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House on Feb. 28 threw the future of Washington&apos;s support for Ukraine in the air, but led to a renewed outpouring of support for Ukraine across the world. As Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine enters its fourth year, and Trump mulls cutting military aid entirely, here are some ways to help Ukraine and stand with Ukrainians. Contact your elected representatives, regardless of where you live. In the U.S., the American Coalition for Ukraine has a tool to find your members of Congress and recommended messaging for what to ask your government representatives. Finding a local group organizing political support for Ukraine in your country or city is a great starting point for getting more involved. You can also find and support candidates who support Ukraine in upcoming elections. It&#x2019;s also possible to boycott international companies that still operate within Russia. The Kyiv School of Economics has made a list of corporations that continue to do business in Russia. The mobile version of the website even has a barcode scanner, so you can easily find the details about a product&#x2019;s parent company. Also, consider supporting Ukrainian brands or local businesses. You can check out our Ukrainian gift guide for inspiration.

Ukraine bonds drop sharply following Trump-Zelensky argument, Reuters reports	Ukraine&apos;s international bonds fell to their lowest point in over a month on March 3 after a heated exchange between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump last week, Reuters reported. According to Tradeweb data cited by Reuters, the 2036 maturity experienced the steepest decline, dropping 4.5 cents to 60.775 cents on the dollar and reaching a one-month low. Bonds tied to economic performance declined the most, with trading activity remaining high, one trader told Reuters. Following Trump&#x2019;s election in November last year, Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereign bonds rose in price as investors expected a quicker end to the war, the Financial Times reported on Nov. 14. But Ukraine&apos;s debt has fluctuated dramatically in recent weeks due to geopolitical tensions and uncertainty about Trump&apos;s willingness to support the war-torn country. Tensions escalated in mid-February when Trump called Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; while improving relations with Russia, causing bond prices to drop sharply, Reuters reported. Ukraine&apos;s GDP warrant, which increases payouts during strong economic growth, also came under pressure, dropping around 2 cents to trade at just over 80 cents on March 3. &quot;The new U.S. administration calls for pessimism,&quot; Paul McNamara at GAM told Reuters. &quot;I see no economic reason to invest.&quot; According to Reuters, most bonds had recovered many losses last week as investors anticipated a minerals agreement during Zelensky&apos;s Washington visit, potentially securing Trump&apos;s backing for Ukraine&apos;s war effort. This optimism collapsed after Friday&apos;s confrontation ended in shouting in the Oval Office, prompting Zelensky to cut his visit short. Ukraine completed a debt restructuring with bondholders last September and now owes around $15.2 billion across eight new series of bonds, as well as $2.6 billion on a GDP warrant. The exchange reduced Ukraine&apos;s external debt by about $9 billion. The earliest maturity date for the new bonds is 2029.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-bonds-drop-sharply-following-trump-zelensky-argument-reuters-reports/	2025-03-03T10:01:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2202528427-1.jpg
US wants Zelensky to 'regret' Oval Office clash, sign minerals deal, Waltz says	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration wants to hear from President Volodymyr Zelensky that he regrets the Oval Office clash, U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told Fox News on March 3. &quot;What we need to hear from President Zelensky is that he regrets what happened, that he&apos;s ready to sign this minerals deal, and that he&apos;s ready to engage in peace talks,&quot; Waltz said. Zelensky&apos;s visit to the White House on Feb. 28 was intended to finalize a long-debated agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine on jointly developing Ukraine&apos;s mineral resources. The press conference instead turned into a public clash, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance berating Zelensky. The Ukrainian president later left the White House without signing the deal. Following the talks, Trump accused Zelensky of &quot;disrespecting&quot; the U.S. in the Oval Office and said the Ukrainian president &quot;is not ready for peace.&quot; Waltz also claimed the confrontation proved that the Ukrainian president was not serious about peace negotiations. &quot;But here&apos;s the problem: time is not on his (Zelensky&apos;s) side. Time is not on the side of indefinitely continuing this conflict. The American people&apos;s patience is not unlimited. Their wallets are not unlimited. Our stockpiles and munitions are not unlimited,&quot; he said. Waltz suggested that Zelensky was jeopardizing Ukraine&apos;s long-term economic ties with the U.S. He said, &quot;He could leave the White House with the U.S. and Ukraine bound together economically for a generation.&quot; Following the exchange, some Republican lawmakers have ramped up criticism of Zelensky, with some even suggesting he may need to step aside. House Speaker Mike Johnson told NBC News on March 2 that Zelensky &quot;needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude, or someone else needs to lead the country.&quot; Waltz himself took aim at Zelensky in an interview with far-right Breitbart News on March 1, comparing him to &quot;an ex-girlfriend that wants to argue everything that you said.&quot; As U.S. officials continue to lambast the Ukrainian president over the incident, European allies gathered in London on March 2 to reaffirm their support for Zelensky and the embattled country.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-needs-to-regret-oval-office-clash-sign-minerals-deal-waltz-says/	2025-03-03T09:15:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193394562.jpg
US deliberately orchestrated Zelensky-Trump Oval Office clash, Friedrich Merz says	The American side deliberately orchestrated the confrontation during President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s visit to the White House, Friedrich Merz, the head of Germany&apos;s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the likely chancellor, said on March 3. &quot;It was not a spontaneous reaction to interventions by Zelensky, but obviously a manufactured escalation in this meeting in the Oval Office,&quot; Merz said at a press conference in Hamburg. The visit was expected to mark the signing of a long-debated agreement between Ukraine and the U.S. on jointly developing Ukraine&apos;s mineral resources. The press conference between Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump turned into a heated exchange, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance berating the Ukrainian leader. Zelensky left the White House without an agreement in hand. Merz said he was &quot;quite surprised, including by the mutual tone of the dialogue,&quot; adding that the incident fit a pattern in recent U.S. behavior. &quot;There is a certain sequence in a number of events in recent weeks and months, including the appearance of the American delegation in Munich at the security conference, and we are now seeing it from Washington,&quot; he said. At the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14, Vance stunned European leaders with a speech attacking European values and calling for cooperation with far-right parties. According to Merz, these events serve as a wake-up call for Europe&apos;s security policy. &quot;I am in favor of preparing for the fact that in the coming years and decades we will have to do much, much more for our own security,&quot; he said. Merz, whose CDU party won Germany&apos;s recent elections, is expected to become chancellor once coalition talks conclude. He has been a vocal critic of the outgoing government&apos;s Ukraine policy and has condemned Trump&apos;s shifting stance on the war. On Feb. 21, Merz called Trump&apos;s statements about Ukraine &quot;shocking&quot; and aligning with Russian narratives.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-deliberately-escalated-tensions-during-zelenskys-white-house-visit-merz-says/	2025-03-03T07:52:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1929925182.jpg
EU weighs satellite alternatives for Ukraine amid Starlink concerns, Politico reports	The European Commission is assessing ways to help Ukraine secure satellite communications in case access to the Starlink network is restricted, Politico reported on March 3. Starlink has played a vital role in Ukraine&apos;s battlefield communications, with around 42,000 terminals providing service to the military, medical facilities, businesses, and aid organizations. The review comes amid reports that the U.S. threatened to cut Ukraine&apos;s access to Starlink if Kyiv did not reach a deal with Washington over critical mineral resources. On Feb. 22, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk denied that the U.S. had made such a threat. Ukraine had shown interest in alternative satellite options, including Govsatcom, a shared network of EU national government satellites, and IRIS, a new constellation expected to be operational in the 2030s, according to European Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier. Member of the European Parliament Christophe Grudler urged the EU to &quot;assess all possible alternative satellite solutions that the EU could offer Ukraine&quot; as a Starlink replacement. Le chantage am&#xE9;ricain pour la fourniture du service internet par satellite Starlink est inacceptable.Je demande &#xE0; @EU_Commission d&apos;&#xE9;tudier toutes les solutions alternatives par satellite que l&#x2019;UE pourrait proposer &#xE0; l&#x2019;Ukraine.Y compris GovSatCom ou des capacit&#xE9;s commerciales. pic.twitter.com/H2zblWNpKA He suggested that Govsatcom deployment could be expedited this year by skipping the certification process and providing a temporary solution while IRIS is being developed. SpaceX began supplying Starlink terminals to Ukraine shortly after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, giving Kyiv a critical advantage in battlefield connectivity. Musk, whom U.S. President Donald Trump has tasked with eliminating &quot;fraud&quot; and &quot;waste&quot; in the U.S. budget, has become increasingly vocal in criticizing Ukraine and amplifying Russian disinformation. He has also called for shutting down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which provided vital humanitarian aid to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-weighs-satellite-alternatives-for-ukraine-amid-starlink-concerns-politico-reports/	2025-03-03T07:16:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1813800965.jpeg
Russia’s FSB 'neutralizes' alleged terrorist planning attack in Moscow	Russia&#x2019;s Federal Security Service (FSB) shot to death a suspected terrorist who was allegedly preparing an attack on the Moscow subway station and a Jewish institution, Russian media reported on Mar. 3. While being detained in Moscow region, the suspect resisted arrest and was &quot;neutralized&quot; during a shootout, the Public Relations Center of the FSB said, in comments reported by Interfax-Russia Firearms and chemical substances for assembling explosive devices were reportedly found and seized during a subsequent investigation at the suspect&apos;s apartment. &quot;The terrorist intended to carry out the detonation of self-made explosive materials,&quot; the FSB said. The suspect was a Russian citizen originating from Central Asia and is alleged to have been a member of an international terrorist organization banned in Russia. After the attack, he planned to join a terrorist organization in Afghanistan, the FSB claimed. According to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, four terrorism suspects were killed by the FSB this year so far. One of them was accused by Russia of undergoing training in Kyiv before preparation of an attack against a Russian official. The State Duma passed a bill on Dec. 12 expanding the criteria for the &apos;Terrorists and Extremists&apos; registry, including political, religious, ideological, racial or national hatred. According to the U.S.-based think tank Institute for the Study of War (ISW), the proposed bill would provide &quot;significant leeway to designate people who have allegedly committed a wide array of crimes as terrorists and extremists.&quot; The law is to take effect on June 1, 2025, Deutsche Welle reported. Russia has been regularly &#xA0;accused of arbitrarily jailing political opponents and dissidents accused of politically-motivated hatred. According to the ISW, in seeking to control dissent, the Kremlin is &quot;looking to change the mechanisms for adding people to the terrorist and extremist list in order to incentivize Russians to engage in self-censorship by tightening the Kremlin&apos;s control over criticism in Russian society, especially about Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-fsb-neutralizes-alleged-terrorist-planning-attack-in-moscow/	2025-03-03T06:45:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1249615636.jpg
Russia trying to break through border in Sumy Oblast, cut off Ukraine's Kursk logistics routes, Border Guard says	The Russian army is trying to break through the Russia-Ukraine border in Sumy Oblast and cut Ukrainian forces off from its logistics routes, State Border Guard spokesperson Andrii Demchenko said on March 3 on national television. Demchenko&apos;s statement comes after Russian forces attempted to cross the Russia-Ukraine border in Sumy Oblast near the village of Novenke but were repelled the previous week. Northeastern Sumy Oblast borders Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukrainian forces launched an incursion last summer to draw away Moscow&apos;s troops from Donbas and disrupt Russian plans for an offensive from the north. Demchenko said Russia is attempting to enter Ukrainian territory with assault groups in the direction of the village of Novenke that lies just across the border, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the regional center, Sumy. The Ukrainian army is making every effort to prevent Russian units from gaining a foothold on Ukrainian territory, Demchenko said, adding that Russian troops mainly use &quot;large numbers of equipment and personnel&quot; in Kursk Oblast to achieve a breakthrough. &quot;These are not mass assaults. When the enemy tries to drive the Ukrainian Defense Forces out of Kursk Oblast, firstly, it puts pressure on our units within Kursk Oblast,&quot; Demchenko said. &quot;And then, it (Russia) is trying to expand the area of active combat activities, trying to enter the territory of Ukraine. However, all elements of the Defense Forces are operating in that area to prevent this. All available weapons are being used,&quot; he added. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, the Russian military claimed. Russian casualties have reached nearly 40,000 in Kursk Oblast, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 6. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said last November that the incursion thwarted Russia&apos;s plans to invade Sumy Oblast in an attempt to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-trying-to-break-through-border-in-sumy-oblast-cut-off-logistics-routes-of-ukrainian-forces-border-guard-says/	2025-03-03T06:20:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2174582368.jpg
Russia plans to launch 500 kamikaze drones per day at Ukraine, HUR says	Russia plans to launch at least 500 drones per aerial attack against Ukraine, Vadym Skibitskyi, the deputy head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), said in an interview with RBC Ukraine published on March 3. Both Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology throughout the war, significantly altering modern warfare tactics. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Russia has launched thousands of cheap but effective drones at Ukraine. Russia currently uses 150 to 200 drones per attack against Ukraine which occur on a daily basis, but Russian forces plan to increase their capabilities to 500, Skibitskyi told RBC Ukraine. Russia also plans to increase the number of sites from which drones will be launched. Russian forces have significantly increased domestic production of various types of drones, according to Skibitskyi. Russia uses combat and reconnaissance drones, as well as so-called &quot;decoys,&quot; which are drones without a payload, he added. &quot;All of this simply overloads our air defense system. It is very difficult to distinguish between a drone flying with a warhead and one without,&quot; Skibitskyi said. &quot;Earlier, in 2023 and early 2024, we knew only a Shahed (drone), then there were Geran-1, Geran-2, and that was it. Today, the range of these unmanned aerial vehicles is so large that it is not even always possible to count them on one hand,&quot; Skibitsky added. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Feb. 6. Russia is forming unmanned systems forces and plans to recruit up to 210,000 personnel for the new branch by 2030. Ukraine, as well as Russia, has continuously expanded its drone capabilities, using aerial, naval, and ground-based systems for reconnaissance, precision strikes, and other operations. The country&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces announced on Jan. 31 that Ukrainian troops are now employing a long-range drone capable of traveling up to 2,000 kilometers (1,242 miles) while carrying a 250-kilogram air bomb.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-plans-to-launch-at-least-500-drones-in-ukraine-in-one-aerial-attack-ukraines-intelligence-says/	2025-03-03T05:44:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1244030448-1665987223fwizj.jpg
Trump’s Oval Office clash with Zelensky killed diplomacy	The showdown between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Feb. 28 shocked the entire world. But instead of analyzing its political impact, let&#x2019;s focus on the details of manners, gestures, which may seem less important than the issues at stake, but reveal more about the underlying basic stance. The first thing that stands out is the behavior of two arrogant and self-assured U.S. politicians treating the leader of Ukraine &#x2014; who was under immense pressure, on the verge of a breakdown &#x2014; in an extremely disrespectful and brutal manner. The only country whose representatives I know to use such brutal language is Russia. Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova wrote: &quot;How Trump and Vance held back from hitting that scumbag is a miracle of restraint.&quot; As expected, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev joined in, calling Zelensky a &quot;cocaine clown.&quot; But such statements are made by second-tier figures, never top leaders. At the level of public diplomacy, Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance violated the rules even respected by figures like Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Mao Zedong. The only other regime that sometimes resorts to similar brutality is North Korea &#x2014; no surprise that Trump has openly praised North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un as a good leader and even called him a friend. Before Zelensky even entered the room, White House staff criticized him for allegedly showing disrespect by not being properly dressed. The entire treatment of Zelensky was disrespectful. What makes it even worse is that Trump, a man who set new standards in public vulgarity, now shamelessly condemns others for disrespect. The ultimate obscenity is reproaching someone for disrespect in a manner that, in itself, is a blatant act of disrespect. Even a simple AI like ChatGPT has better manners than Trump and Vance in a conversation. Additionally, U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz described Zelensky&apos;s reaction to being dismissed with a tasteless metaphor: &quot;It&apos;s like, you know, an ex-girlfriend who wants to argue about everything you said nine years ago, instead of moving the relationship forward.&quot; So, was the open conflict in the Oval Office a spontaneous outburst? At the very least, this obscene exchange had been brewing, waiting to explode. We should bear in mind that, at the level of substantive content, nothing new happened. To put it in Hegelian terms, this was a passage from &#x201C;An sich&#x201D; (in-itself) to &#x201C;F&#xFC;r sich&#x201D; (for-itself) &#x2014; from mere background presence to the explicit positing of content. This shift changes everything: once something is directly stated, it cannot be undone. Everyone in a group might know something that is only in itself and could interpret it away as a misunderstanding, but once it&#x2019;s out in the open, it&#x2019;s a different matter. In the case of the Oval Office meeting, although tensions had always been palpable, things became tense when Vance pressed Zelensky for not appreciating the United States&#x2019; help in Ukraine&#x2019;s war with Russia. What followed was an open shouting match &#x2014; something unheard of in diplomacy, where such direct and brutal exchanges are typically saved for behind closed doors. As some commentators noted, diplomacy died in the Oval Office. What we witnessed was something more akin to a low-level negotiation between mafia bosses. Vance&#x2019;s argument, that after years of trying to break Russia with arms, the time has come for diplomacy, is so full of holes that its inconsistency is glaring. War (Russian aggression) erupted after years of ineffective diplomatic attempts &#x2014; when Russia occupied Crimea in 2014, diplomacy achieved nothing. The heroic Ukrainian resistance, supported by the West, didn&#x2019;t fail; it created conditions for possible negotiations. Without this resistance, Ukraine would no longer exist as a state. And, as we&#x2019;ve already seen, who are Trump and Vance to talk about diplomacy after they&#x2019;ve broken all its rules? It&#x2019;s na&#xEF;ve to claim that exposing tensions will clarify the situation. First, as we&#x2019;ve seen, making things public can preclude possible solutions by adding acts of aggression and humiliation. Second, and more important, what occurred in the Oval Office was not a process of bringing out true tensions: the situation remained obscured, with Trump clearly angry at Ukraine and Europe, and Zelensky placed in an impossible position &#x2014; he had to defend Ukraine&#x2019;s vital interests, which were ignored by the U.S., while also showing respect and gratitude, knowing Ukraine&#x2019;s survival depends on U.S. support.

(Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)Should we blame Zelensky? Shouldn&#x2019;t he have been more aware of the need for U.S. help and acted more considerately? A contrast is clear with French President Emmanuel Macron and, especially, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who, as Owen Jones pointed out, during his last visit to Washington, virtually disappeared up Trump&#x2019;s backside. I believe Zelensky should not only not be reproached &#x2014; on the contrary, we should fully appreciate his tragic predicament. He defended himself clearly and counterattacked, but he had to combine this with a humiliating respect for Trump, who supports the Russian agenda. Trump&#x2019;s claim that Zelensky doesn&#x2019;t want a ceasefire but a continuous war was simply a lie: of course, Zelensky wanted peace, but &#x2014; quite understandably &#x2014; a peace that would not just be a ceasefire opening the door for Russian reorganization and renewed attack. To paraphrase Carl von Clausewitz&#x2019;s well-known definition of war as a continuation of politics by other means, such a ceasefire would be a continuation of war with peaceful means. Trump&#x2019;s repeated metaphor of cards is also misleading &#x2014; Zelensky was right to reply, &quot;I don&#x2019;t play cards.&quot; Jews didn&#x2019;t hold any good cards in Nazi Germany, especially after 1938, but should we have told them, &quot;Sorry, you don&#x2019;t have good cards &#x2014; you want our full support, but this could lead to a new world war&quot;? How can one argue against that logic? After Trump and Vance humiliated Zelensky for not showing enough gratitude, he posted a brief message on X: &#x201C;Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.&#x201D; Was this almost compulsive repetition of &#x201C;thanks&#x201D; meant to show gratitude for the lack of which Trump and Vance criticized him, or is there an element of irony in this message, whether intentional or not? When Trump evokes humanitarian reasons, there is always a hidden horror behind it. Remember that he also claimed Gaza should be emptied for humanitarian reasons, but neither in Gaza nor Ukraine did he ask the obvious question: who is responsible for the destruction? Both in Gaza and in Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, &quot;America First&quot; clearly means business. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio extolled the &#x201C;extraordinary opportunities, economic and geopolitical, that the U.S. and Russia could both seize once the war in Ukraine was over.&#x201D; This emphasis on business is not just an ideology, but one thoroughly intertwined with specific ideological-political choices. Business presupposes a set of unwritten rules that should be respected &#x2014; basic trust is fundamental. These rules are violated by Trump, who turns business into a brutal game of blackmail. As for political choices: why treat China as the main enemy and dismiss any &#x201C;extraordinary opportunities&#x201D; for collaboration with China? Why, especially, does Trump repeatedly characterize Europe as the main foe of the U.S., including the absurd claim that the EU was created to &quot;screw&quot; the U.S.? The story is well-known, so there&#x2019;s no need to repeat it here. And there&#x2019;s no need to point out what Europe should do: if Trump claims the EU was made to screw the U.S., then Europe should respond fully &#x2014; politically, economically, and militarily &#x2014; all options should be on the table, including a new alliance with China and de-dollarization. In short, Europe should unite as much as possible and declare a state of emergency. What Trump is doing in his obscene actions is applying to politics the stances he declared publicly years ago. The horror of such actions extends well beyond economic extortion and the violation of diplomatic norms. When someone acts legally, their external acts do not violate any legal prohibitions or regulations. However, politeness &#x2014; manners, gallantry, etc. &#x2014; is more than just obeying external legality. It&#x2019;s the ambiguously imprecise domain of what one is not strictly obligated to do (but is expected to do). This is part of our unspoken customs and expectations, something rooted in our inherited substance of social mores. Incidentally, this is the self-destructive deadlock of Political Correctness: it tries to formulate and legalize manners. Trump and Vance, great opponents of Political Correctness, acted precisely this way when they forced Zelensky into an impossible position by demanding that he explicitly say &#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D; Trumpian discourse (in its strict Lacanian sense of a social link sustained by speech) poses a threat to the very substance of our social life. It contributes directly to the social disintegration that many analysts have noted. The lack of manners excludes others from communication: I pretend to listen to my partner, but I don&#x2019;t really hear them. This stance is becoming a mass phenomenon. Here&#x2019;s what Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said after the Oval Office meeting: &#x201C;What I saw in the Oval Office was disrespectful, and I don&#x2019;t know if we could ever do business with Zelensky again. I think most Americans saw a guy that they would not want to go into business with, the way he handled the meeting.&#x201D; Again, the term &#x201C;business&#x201D; is revealing here. Graham then urged Zelensky to prioritize a minerals deal over security guarantees or a ceasefire with Russia &#x2014; an obscenity if there ever was one. The minerals deal was a clear case of extortion by the U.S.: you get our help if you pay for it &#x2014; estimated by Trump at $350 billion, which is more than the actual sum &#x2014; by allowing the U.S. to exploit your natural resources for decades to come. In other words, the minerals deal was a price for security guarantees. A minerals deal without security guarantees is meaningless for Ukraine. The whole affair becomes even more obscene when we combine it with Trump and Vance&#x2019;s demands for gratitude: Ukraine must say &#x201C;Thank you!&#x201D; for help and then pay for it. A classic example of political &#x201C;realism&#x201D; &#x2014; Trump and his gang like to present themselves as &#x201C;realists,&#x201D; repeating the mantra that they just want to prevent the concrete suffering, destruction, and death of ordinary people. However, as John Ganz insightfully pointed out, such &#x201C;realist&#x201D; views (practiced by Henry Kissinger, for example) ignore the concrete suffering of hundreds of thousands of individuals. Zelensky told Vance about the Russian threat: &quot;You have a nice ocean and don&#x2019;t feel it now, but you will in the future.&quot; Trump immediately jumped in: &quot;Don&#x2019;t tell us what we&#x2019;re going to feel!&quot; Trump&#x2019;s arrogance seduced him into misreading Zelensky: his &#x201C;you will feel it&#x201D; had nothing to do with subjective feeling; it referred to political and military pressure. Trump, however, took it as Zelensky ordering him how to feel &#x2014; if anyone should have been ordered to feel gratitude, it was Zelensky. In a normal exchange between allies, Zelensky should have responded that it is Ukraine that deserves respect and gratitude for defending not only its own sovereignty but also the freedom of all of Europe and, ultimately, the U.S. Editor&#x2019;s Note: The opinions expressed in the op-ed section are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/slavoj-zizek-trumps-oval-office-clash-with-zelensky-killed-diplomacy/	2025-03-03T05:31:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202563777.jpg
Trump says US should spend' less time worrying about Putin'	U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 2 that the U.S. should &quot;spend less time worrying about Putin,&quot; and instead focus on immigrants who engage in a range of alleged criminal behavior. &quot;We should spend less time worrying about Putin, and more time worrying about migrant rape gangs, drug lords, murderers, and people from mental institutions entering our country &#x2014; &#xA0;so that we don&#x2019;t end up like Europe!&quot; he said in a post on Truth Social. The post comes just days after the U.S. under Trump&apos;s administration welcomed Andrew and Tristan Tate &#x2014; &#xA0;social media influencers accused of rape, human trafficking, and money laundering &#x2014; into the country from Romania where they were under criminal investigation. Trump&apos;s comments are the latest instalment of a widening gulf between the U.S., and Ukraine and its European allies. His public spat with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House on Feb. 28 upended plans to sign a natural resources treaty between the two countries. The leaders of France and the U.K. visited the U.S. last week to convince Trump to play a role in Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability, but their diplomatic efforts were overshadowed by the unprecedented and televised quarrel in the White House. The humiliating treatment Zelensky received from Trump and Vice President JD Vance prompted Europe&apos;s leaders to speak out in support of the Ukrainian president. At the same time, some European officials have appealed to Zelensky to mend ties with Trump to ensure continued U.S. engagement.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-says-us-should-spend-less-time-worrying-about-putin/	2025-03-03T05:26:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2154393954.jpg
6 silver linings of the Trump-Zelensky showdown	The ambush by hired hand U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the White House Oval Office at high noon on Feb. 28 made for great theater, more 24-hour TV than diplomacy. At first, it seemed like an absolute disaster for President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukraine, potentially risking the withdrawal of U.S. military support and even harder days ahead in Ukrainians&#x2019; existential fight for survival against Russia. But after the dust settled on the Oval Office saloon floor, a few silver linings for Ukraine became clear. First, while the minerals deal hardly seemed worth the paper it was written on for Ukraine &#x2014; offering zero real commitments, whether security or financial, from the U.S. &#x2014; it did give Zelensky one thing: time in the White House. A chance to make Ukraine&#x2019;s case and, in the worst case, to truly assess where the Trump administration stands: with Russia or with Ukraine. If it was the former, at least Ukraine would know and could plan accordingly rather than be left in limbo. As it turned out, the worst-case scenario played out. The aggression from both Vance and U.S. President Donald Trump toward Zelensky made it clear: they stand with Russia. Trump even repeated his infamous Helsinki summit claim &#x2014; that he trusts Russian President Vladimir Putin more than Ukraine&#x2019;s leadership. Ukraine now knows the U.S. does not stand behind it, and it will be better prepared as a result. It will have to adapt its strategies and seek other options. Second, the U.S. position has now been exposed to the world. It stands behind Russia and can no longer be viewed as a neutral arbiter in peace talks. In fact, Washington has lost its right to lead those negotiations. Before the Oval Office showdown, Ukraine and Europe had largely been sidelined from the peace process, which was driven by the U.S. and Russia. Ukraine and Europe feared an imposed settlement &#x2014; one unlikely to be sustainable. But the White House debacle forced Europe to step up and take the initiative. The result? Any future peace deal is now more likely to be in Ukraine&#x2019;s favor and more durable. Trump was casual about Ukraine&#x2019;s legitimate security concerns, but Europe can now put them front and center. The initiative has shifted away from Russia and the U.S. &#x2014; both of which had been working against the interests of Ukraine and Europe. In fact, the four-point peace plan proposed by the U.K., along with Britain, Italy, and France leading the way, seemed pragmatic: arm Ukraine, give it the tools to defend itself, push for a one-month truce (focused on air and sea, where verification is easier), and only then move toward a full ceasefire. Europe has made clear that Ukraine needs security guarantees &#x2014; and the arms to enforce them.

(Justin Tallis/Pool/AFP via Getty Images)Third, the White House fiasco should be Europe&#x2019;s final wake-up call: NATO as we knew it is dead, the U.S. security guarantee for Europe is over, and if Europeans care about their own defense, they need to act. And, judging by the weekend&#x2019;s response, they have. There are now zero excuses for Europe not to massively ramp up defense spending and rebuild its hard power. None. Yes, European defense spending will increase, but the continent still faces capacity constraints in military industries. In the short term, reliance on the U.S. is inevitable. But Europe has leverage &#x2014; if it chooses to use it. Europe will spend more on defense, but it will need to buy weapons from the U.S. in the short term. If it were smart, it would get ahead of the curve by committing to a long-term procurement deal &#x2014; say, $1 trillion over 10 years. Call it the Trump Defense of Democracy Program, whatever strokes Trump&#x2019;s ego. The reality is, Trump would struggle to say no to the jobs, jobs, jobs such a deal would create in the U.S. This would buy Europe time to scale up its own defense industry while securing weapons in the interim. Longer term, there&#x2019;s a lot of talk about a &#x201C;Reverse Nixon&#x201D; &#x2014; a U.S. realignment with Russia against China. That would be an absurd long-term choice. Pushing away a $27 trillion European economy in favor of a $2 trillion Russian one? Europe will get its defense industries in order, and when it does, it will provide the U.S. with an unrivaled industrial base against China. Imagine Europe spending 4% of $27 trillion on defense in a decade &#x2014; that&#x2019;s $1.1 trillion, half of Russia&#x2019;s GDP. Even going full war economy, Russia cannot match that. But Europe can. It was also encouraging to see Turkey at the Lancaster House summit over the weekend. With an 800,000-strong land army, Turkey is the only European NATO power capable of putting tens &#x2014; if not hundreds &#x2014; of thousands of troops on the ground in Ukraine. It also has the manufacturing scale to help bridge Europe&#x2019;s defense production gaps. But Turkey wants something in return &#x2014; technology transfers, financial access, and a deeper trade relationship with both the EU and U.K. These are low-hanging fruit. Turkey is no ally of Russia; it fears a Russian victory in Ukraine and the resulting domination of the Black Sea. Europe needs to engage with Turkey, not ignore it. Fourth, the U.K. is back in Europe. Whether intentionally or not, Britain has found itself thrust into the peace process. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer &#x2014; &#x201C;Charmer Starmer&#x201D; &#x2014; played a blinder over the weekend, proving adept at talking to the U.S., Europe, and Ukraine alike. The U.K.&#x2019;s first-class diplomatic skills, sorely missing since Brexit, are back in play. If Britain wants a safe and secure Europe, it has to put skin in the game &#x2014; whether that means boots on the ground or brogues in the conference room. Fifth, the Oval Office debacle exposed the real bullies and aggressors &#x2014; and who the victims are. Zelensky stood up for the little guy. Imagine losing hundreds of thousands of people to Russian war crimes &#x2014; murdered, raped, kidnapped &#x2014; only to be told to say &#x201C;thank you&#x201D; to the U.S. for its aid. As CNN later revealed, Zelensky has already publicly thanked the U.S. 94 times. What more does Washington want? Groveling? Kissing Trump&#x2019;s ring? The Global South will take note &#x2014; and likely side with Ukraine. Sixth, if I were sitting in Beijing, I&#x2019;d be worried. The events in Washington made one thing clear: the U.S. is aligning with Russia against China. That&#x2019;s a strategic disaster for Beijing. China needs to make more friends in Europe &#x2014; now. And Europe should reciprocate. It&#x2019;s time to show the U.S. that it is not Europe&#x2019;s only option.

Attacks on Ukraine’s draft officers on the rise, fueled by social tension and Russian interference	Within a single week in February, several attacks against enlistment offices and personnel in Ukraine took place, resulting in injuries among both military and civilians. The most striking was the murder of an enlistment officer at a gas station in Poltava Oblast. A man killed the officer during an attempt to kidnap his acquaintance who had recently been mobilized into the army. The soldier died immediately from the gunshot wounds. Two accomplices were detained later the same day. &quot;Killing military personnel in the rear is a red line that cannot be crossed,&quot; Mykhailo Drapatyi, commander of Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces, wrote on Facebook, reacting to the recent attacks. &quot;We have already seen cases of humiliation and aggression against our defenders, but I have not seen a strong public reaction. Now, we have direct armed attacks. This is how the enemy works,&quot; Drapatyi added. As Ukraine steps up its mobilization efforts, attacks on personnel are becoming more frequent, driven by escalating social tensions as the war drags on. In search of the perpetrators, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) insists that Russian special services are behind the latest incidents. In the meantime, criticism of the government&apos;s mobilization policy, as well as its inability to protect service members is also mounting. &#x201C;Everything that was done regarding mobilization was done in the worst possible way,&#x201D; Andrii Osadchuk, a lawmaker of the Holos faction and deputy chairman of parliament&apos;s Law Enforcement Committee, told the Kyiv Independent. The consequences of poorly organized mobilization efforts have been emotional and psychological, creating a fragility of social relations in Ukraine that Russia is exploiting, Osadchuk said. Throughout the full-scale invasion, Ukraine has had to confront Russian aggression not only on the battlefield. In February alone, the SBU detained dozens of individuals who it said were recruited by Russian special services and involved in sabotage activities in Ukraine. Among the detained were both adults and underage citizens who acted on Russia&apos;s orders. They reported the coordinates of Ukraine&apos;s critical infrastructure, set fire to military vehicles, and organized disinformation campaigns. Two cases were also related to attacks against enlistment office staff. The SBU and Ukraine&apos;s National Police on Feb. 5 detained Russian agents who had detonated explosives near an enlistment office in Pavlohrad, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. On the same day, the SBU determined the circumstances of the recruitment of another agent who blew himself up in an enlistment office in the western Ukrainian city of Rivne. The explosives were detonated remotely, killing the agent and injuring six other people. According to Serhii Andrushchenko, SBU&apos;s deputy head, the remote detonation of self-made devices is a new tactic of the Russian special services, allowing them to get rid of the perpetrator of the crime and not pay them the promised money for carrying out an attack. &quot;Russian special services simply use these people for their purposes as expendable material. An FSB (Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service) officer does not care what happens to them after the task is completed,&quot; Andrushchenko said.

(Serhii Mykhalchuk/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Russian special services are trying to destabilize the situation with terrorist attacks against the military to discredit enlistment offices, disrupt mobilization, and sow distrust in Ukrainian forces, Andrushchenko added. Osadchuk echoed Andrushchenko&apos;s stance, saying that destabilization inside Ukraine is &quot;an absolute priority&quot; for Russia. The expert stressed that Russian special services have been operating similarly for decades in Ukraine but have been particularly active over the past two and a half years of the full-scale invasion. Russia&#x2019;s efforts to destabilize the situation in Ukraine are made easier due to the fact that people are &#x201C;exhausted, traumatized, and tense,&#x201D; Osadchuk said. The societal conditions are ripe for these types of crimes, he said. Ukraine is continuing efforts to boost the pace of mobilization and increase the number of its troops as Russia advances on the front line. The Ukrainian government adopted updated legislation on mobilization in 2024, and the Defense Ministry has opened several recruitment centers throughout the country for the Ukrainian military. Despite attempts to make military service more attractive for volunteers, including the right to choose a post in the army and financial bonuses, enlistment offices still fulfill the main function of mobilization in Ukraine. The reputation of draft offices is often overshadowed by accusations &#x2014; at times justified &#x2014; of forced conscription without compliance with fundamental civil rights, as well as ill-treatment of conscripts in recruitment centers. Cases of wrongdoing are exploited by Russian propaganda to fuel negative attitudes toward enlistment officers and Ukraine&#x2019;s mobilization efforts. &quot;(Russian) psychological operations do not appear out of the blue. It is true that there is class differentiation in mobilization. But it is also true that no state in the world has ever fought a war and won it exclusively with volunteers,&quot; Dmytro Kukharchuk, head of recruitment of the Third Assault Brigade, wrote on Facebook. Young residents line up after enlisting in civil mobilization in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 28, 2022. (Laurent Van der Stockt for Le Monde/Getty Images)&quot;We can argue about the methods of mobilization, justice, and the human element in the enlistment offices. And there will be truth in each of these disputes. But war does not wait for us to agree,&quot; Kukharchuk added. Although Russia officially declared mobilization only once at the beginning of the all-out war, the Russian government has made considerable efforts to replenish its troops. Russia&#x2019;s recruitment tactics involve offering attractive financial incentives, pardoning crimes, or simply taking people off the streets. Trying to avoid increasing tensions in society, Russia has recruited civilians from less populated regions and marginalized ethnic minority communities. It has also supplemented its troops by forcibly drafting tens of thousands of Ukrainians in occupied territories &#x2014; a war crime, according to international law. Osadchuk insists that the way enlistment offices in Ukraine carry out their work must be reorganized completely to prevent the situation from deteriorating. According to the lawmaker, &quot;Russia or any of its other forms of existence&quot; will not disappear even after the hot phase of the war is over, and Ukraine &quot;needs to learn&#x201D; how to deal with Russia&#x2019;s operations. It is also important to highlight the work of law enforcement agencies that detain those who collaborate with Russia, according to Osadchuk. &quot;We see that the most vulnerable group is young people aged 14 to 18 who are hired through Telegram channels,&quot; Osadchuk said. &quot;They need to be taught simple things. It is a crime. If you fall for the campaign and the promised thousand dollars, you will not get it. Instead, you will get three to ten years (in prison). You will ruin your life forever,&quot; he added. Osadchuk also emphasized the need to change the government&apos;s information policy. &quot;It is harmful to promote narratives that encourage relaxation and apathy rather than mobilization and unity,&quot; the lawmaker said. According to Osadchuk, President Volodymyr Zelensky made a mistake by promoting the narrative that the war could end soon, demotivating both civilians and the military. &quot;No real fact suggests that the hot war phase should stop somewhere. Our imagination wants it, but we are not there,&quot; Osadchuk said. &quot;Everyone should realize that the war is not &apos;somewhere over there.&apos; It can be lost. We could be forced to retreat from Kyiv. This is not a fantasy or intimidation at all. It can really happen,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-on-ukraines-draft-personnel-rise-fueled-by-social-tension-and-russian-interference/	2025-03-03T04:56:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1468750344.jpg
Trump sided with Putin. Europe, what’s your move?	U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance&#x2019;s verbal assault on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office will mark Feb. 28, 2025, as an infamous moment in American and world history. The United States is rapidly destroying its good name and alienating everyone except the world&#x2019;s most brutal dictators. The damage to America&#x2019;s credibility and reputation will take decades to repair &#x2014; and may be irreparable. More broadly, with the end of the postwar U.S.-centered international order, we are witnessing the collapse of any global authority. As rogue states seek to capitalize on the chaos, Europe must step up and assume the role once played by the U.S. That starts by fully supporting Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. Yes, Europe is not as powerful as the U.S. militarily; but that does not mean it is weak. In fact, it holds all the cards that it needs. Its combined military forces are among the world&#x2019;s strongest, most experienced, and most innovative. The Oval Office quarrel &#x2014; which Trump and Vance seemed all too eager to &#x2014; should be the final impetus for Europe to get its act together, after decades of complacency. It has everything it needs to stand on its own, to support Ukraine, and to deter Russia. Moreover, Trump&#x2019;s shameful behavior is pushing America&#x2019;s dearest ally closer to Europe, helping to bridge the post-Brexit divide. It is galvanizing the forces of democracy and compelling political elites to wake up. Europe may soon have a moderate two-party ruling coalition in Germany, and a committed democratic one in Austria. After a terrible year, French President Emmanuel Macron&#x2019;s star is rising again. Europe has a half-billion people and a GDP comparable to the U.S. We may not be as innovative, but the gap is not as large as pundits would have you believe. If we forge a coalition with Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, we can close it soon &#x2014; especially now that Trump, Vance, and Elon Musk are destroying the pillars of U.S. power with their own cultural revolution. In addition to raising costs for American consumers with tariffs, the Trump administration is waging a war on immigrants &#x2013; long a unique source of American strength. Europe should capitalize by welcoming the best and brightest &#x2014; including those being hounded out of America&#x2019;s world-class federal agencies. As for defense capabilities, Germany&#x2019;s industrial base is sufficient to arm the continent, while France and Britain&#x2019;s nuclear umbrella can replace America&#x2019;s. The five largest European countries and the United Kingdom all currently have responsible, predictable governments that make a mockery of those now in power in Washington. Poland has an especially important role to play in what happens next. Economic trends are on our side. Our army is growing. We made the right arms purchases while there was still time. Not even Trump can find a bad word to say about us. All of Europe can see this. The French (slightly jealous) speak of &#x201C;le moment polonais.&#x201D; Poland&#x2019;s current leaders are among the most experienced, respected, and resolute statesmen to be found anywhere.

(Attila Husejnow/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)At the recent Munich Security Conference, I spoke with many U.S. politicians &#x2014; including those, like Senator Lindsey Graham, who are bending the knee to Trump &#x2014; and I did not see much self-confidence. Rather than saying what they really think, they debased themselves and toed the Dear Leader&#x2019;s line. It was embarrassing to watch. When the Trump administration&#x2019;s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, was asked backstage whether &#x201C;we still have an alliance,&#x201D; he admitted that he himself doesn&#x2019;t know. Power in Washington is now completely concentrated in Trump. There are no longer any &#x201C;adults in the room,&#x201D; only sycophantic parrots competing to amplify their foolish master the loudest. Historian Timothy Snyder struck the right note in arguing that 2025 is not about what America thinks; it is about what Europe can do. The Trump policy (a generous term) can only be profitable in the short term; for now, no one will dare to go head-to-head with the U.S. In the long run, however, the dismantling of the U.S. state, the pointless tariffs, and the alienation of friends and allies will cause lasting damage. This is the moment to stand behind Ukraine. The treatment that Zelensky received was an absolute disgrace, loudly cheered by Russia. And no, he would not have gotten a better result if he had let himself be pushed around. This U.S. government has shown where its loyalties lie. The same thing happened with the critical-minerals agreement that Trump&#x2019;s advisers have been forcing on Ukraine. The first version amounted to mafia-style extortion, and Zelensky rightly rejected it. When a follow-up deal came, it was much better. I will not be surprised if Trump and Vance&#x2019;s disgusting behavior provokes a backlash from the American public. But Europeans cannot afford to wait. With Trump back in the White House, Americans will have their own very big problems to worry about. Europeans must take our future into our own hands.

Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 6, injure 26 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed six civilians and injured 26 others over the past day, regional authorities reported on March 3. Russian forces launched 83 drones from the Russian cities of Orel, Kursk, Millerovo, and Primosk-Akhtarsk at Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 46 drones over Kharkiv, Sumy, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava, &#xA0;Kyiv, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, the Air Force said. Another 31 drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are often decoys that Russia launches alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 25 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, over the past day. As a result of the attacks, four people were killed, and 10 other people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian forces killed two civilians and injured another in the city of Pokrovsk. One person was also injured in the town of Kostiantynivka, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Kharkiv Oblast, Russian drones hit a five-story building, injuring eight people, including a 6-year-old child, in the regional center of Kharkiv. As a result of a Russian attack with four glide bombs at the village of Dovzhyk, a woman and a man suffered injuries, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian forces targeted the town of Nikopol with artillery, injuring an 84-year-old man and two women, aged 44 and 82. The man was rescued from the rubble and hospitalized in a severe condition. Russia also attacked the city of Kryvyi Rih with drones. A 52-year-old woman was injured, the local military administration reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-6-injure-26-over-past-day/	2025-03-03T04:30:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-03-13_40_53.jpeg
Kyiv, not Kiev — How Ukrainians reclaimed their capital	For decades, if not more, English speakers the world over referred to Ukraine&#x2019;s capital as Kiev, pronouncing it kee-yev. Few people knew they were using the Russian name for the city. The city is pronounced keeiv in Ukrainian and is transliterated correctly into English as Kyiv. In fact, until recently, the names of almost all Ukrainian places and people were transliterated according to their Russian versions. After gaining independence in 1991, Ukrainians lobbied the international community to adopt native transliterations when speaking and writing about Ukrainian cities. Their efforts were largely ignored for several decades as Ukraine struggled to shake its reputation as a former part of Russia. The needle began to move slightly in 2014 when Russia invaded Ukraine&#x2019;s east and annexed Crimea. With the outset of the full-scale invasion in 2022, the world seemed to get the message. Most major news outlets, academic publications, and government bodies now refer to Ukrainian place names by their Ukrainian transliterations. There are still some hold-outs, however, most notably among media outlets that often parrot Kremlin narratives. &#xA0; The Russian spelling and pronunciation of Kyiv throughout the ages was no accident. While the name gets its origin from an empire that predates Russia, a series of policies by the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union that sought to Russify Ukraine and the Ukrainian language distorted its roots. Kyiv, located on the Dnipro River, was officially founded in 482 A.D., although archeological evidence suggests there has been a settlement on the site for about 2,000 years. Various theories about its founding exist &#x2014; with the founders being said to be Goths, Huns, and Turks, among others &#x2014; but the most popular legend credits four royal siblings of an Eastern Slavic tribe with establishing the city in the 5th century. Kyiv is thus said to be named after the eldest sibling, Kyi, similar to how the mythical Romulus inspired the name Rome. In the 9th century, Kyiv became the capital and cultural center of Kyivan Rus, a medieval state spanning eastern and northern Europe, from which modern Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus all trace their origins. During the &#x201C;Golden Age&#x201D; of Kyivan Rus, Kyiv emerged as a political, cultural, and religious center, with landmarks like Saint Sophia&#x2019;s Cathedral and the Pechersk Lavra monastery complex reflecting its importance and prosperity. View from The Bell Tower of Saint-Sophia &#x421;athedral in Kyiv, Ukraine on May 23, 2024. (Oleh Tymoshenko / The Kyiv Independent)Moscow, founded at the tail end of Kyivan rule in 1147 A.D., is more than 600 years younger than Kyiv. Over the eight centuries that followed the breakup of Kyivan Rus, Kyiv was controlled by the Mongols, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Kingdom of Poland, the Russian Empire, and lastly the Soviet Union before becoming the capital of independent Ukraine. Both the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union drew their national identity from the legacy of Kyivan Rus. Authors of Russian history and the Russian state, including President Vladimir Putin, have envisioned their control over the city as a prerequisite for reuniting a long-lost empire. This imperial preoccupation also underpins current Russian narratives; in Putin&#x2019;s view, Kyiv is the mother city of a great Slavic kingdom that is destined to be reunified. Under the Russian Empire and Soviet Union, Russian cities, including Saint Petersburg and Moscow, dictated official language policies. In Soviet times, Moscow required all 15 member republics of the Soviet Union to adopt Russian as their official language. The result was that over the last century, Westerners came to know Ukrainian cities by their official Russian-language transliterations: Kiev as opposed to Kyiv, Kharkov as opposed to Kharkiv, Lvov as opposed to Lviv, and Odessa as opposed to Odesa. This lack of international awareness and recognition of the languages and cultures of individual Soviet member states meant &#x201C;Russian&#x201D; became a commonplace blanket term for all things Soviet. This legacy carried on past the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. Many foreign governments and media outlets continued to refer to Ukrainian cities by their Russian transliterations, bolstered by and contributing to the widespread stereotypes that &#x201C;everyone in Ukraine speaks Russian&#x201D; and the factually incorrect &#x201C;Ukraine is a former part of Russia.&#x201D; &#xA0; After the 2014 EuroMaidan revolution and Russia&#x2019;s annexation of Ukraine&#x2019;s Crimea and invasion of Donbas, more institutions in the West began acknowledging Ukraine&#x2019;s political and linguistic sovereignty.

(Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images)By 2019, many diplomatic missions and English-language news outlets had switched to using Ukrainian spellings of Ukrainian proper names out of respect for the country. Social media has also played a pivotal role in encouraging foreigners to switch to using Ukrainian names. Ukraine&#x2019;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs launched the #ReformUA campaign in the late 2010s, with hashtags such as #KyivNotKiev, #LvivNotLvov, and #KharkivNotKharkov. The effort also discouraged referring to Ukraine as &#x201C;the Ukraine&#x201D; &#x2014; which insinuates that it is a region in a larger nation, rather than an individual state in its own right. Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022 brought global attention to Ukraine and its capital city, prompting widespread adoption of &#x201C;Ukrainian&#x201D; spellings &#x2014; or rather, since Ukrainian uses a Cyrillic alphabet, Latin alphabet transliterations that better reflect the Ukrainian pronunciation of names.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-not-kiev-how-ukrainians-reclaimed-their-capital-and-their-future/	2025-03-03T03:24:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/Illustration.JPG
Trump-Putin summit now being 'fast-tracked,' CNN reports	Preparations for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin are now being &quot;fast-tracked,&quot; CNN reported on March 2, citing undisclosed sources. The news comes after President Volodymyr Zelensky left Washington early without signing a mineral deal with the U.S. following a tense argument with Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance in front of journalists. Trump&apos;s spat with Zelensky on Feb. 28 was an additional incentive for the next round of talks on restoring relations between the U.S. and Russia to take place in the coming weeks, the sources told CNN. The next meeting between the Russian and American presidents may take place in one of the Persian Gulf countries, according to CNN. The first round of talks on Feb. 18 in Saudi Arabia marked the first direct negotiations between the U.S. and Russia since Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion began, with Russia&apos;s delegation, led by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, sitting down with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials. Ukraine was not invited to participate. Following the initial meeting, Rubio outlined three main objectives both sides had agreed to pursue. These include restoring embassy staff in Washington and Moscow, creating a high-level team to facilitate Ukraine peace talks, and exploring ways to strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-trump-summit-now-being-fast-tracked-cnn-reports/	2025-03-03T02:58:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-810261630.jpg
A tragedy' — Russia strikes Ukrainian military training ground during exercises, Drapatyi, says	Russian forces struck a Ukrainian military training ground in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast on March 1 during a formation exercise, Mykhailo Drapatyi, Commander of the Ground Forces of Ukraine, said on March 3. A day earlier, reports of a Russian attack with an Iskander-M ballistic missile on a training ground in the village of Cherkaske near the regional center of Dnipro began circulated on social media. The strike was allegedly carried out after an Orlan drone spotted a formation of soldiers about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the front line. Drapatyi did not disclose the number of Ukrainian soldiers killed and injured. He added that the truth about the attack could be hidden &quot;in the fog of bureaucracy&quot; but promised to prevent this. &quot;A tragedy at a training ground is a terrible consequence of an enemy strike. The war requires quick decisions, responsibility, and new safety standards; otherwise, we will lose more than we have,&quot; Drapatyi said. Drapatyi added he had launched an investigation into the circumstances of the strike and appointed an independent review with the participation of military counterintelligence. &quot;Everyone who made decisions that day, and everyone who did not make them on time, will be held accountable. No one will hide behind explanations or formal reports,&quot; he said. On March 1, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed that it had launched an Iskander M missile at the Novomoskovsk military training ground in Dnipro Oblast. Soldiers of the 157th Separate Mechanized Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were allegedly undergoing military training there. This is not the first time Russia has attacked Ukrainian troops while they are lining up in the rear. On November 3, 2023, in a village near the front line in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian forces attacked a group of soldiers. As a result of the Russian missile strike, 19 soldiers of the 128th Brigade and two civilians were killed. According to an investigation by Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry, the soldiers were gathered in the courtyard of a house during an awards ceremony while all camouflage rules were ignored.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-strikes-training-ground-during-formation-resulting-in-mass-casualties-ukraines-military-says/	2025-03-03T02:49:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1243729890.jpg
Trump to discuss potential suspension, cancellation of military aid for Ukraine on March 3	U.S. President Donald Trump will discuss on March 3 the possible suspension or complete cancellation of military aid to Ukraine, including weapons pledged by the Biden administration, The New York Times (NYT) reported, citing an undisclosed source. The news comes after Trump&apos;s public spat with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House on Feb. 28 that upended plans to sign a natural resources treaty between the two countries. An unnamed administration official told NYT that Trump will meet on March 3 with his top national security aides, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, to review and potentially act on a range of policy options for Ukraine. Among the issues to be considered will be the suspension or cancellation of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, including the latest shipments of ammunition and equipment authorized during the Biden administration, the official said. Zelensky has repeatedly urged the U.S. to continue shipping arms to Ukraine to strengthen Kyiv&apos;s position in future peace negotiations with Russia. The Trump administration has not authorized new weapons shipments for Ukraine, but has not halted those that were announced under the previous Biden administration. Reuters reported in early February that opposing factions within the administration had been debating whether the U.S. should continue providing weapons. The U.S. has provided Ukraine with $65.9 billion in military aid since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Trump signed an executive order on the first day of his term freezing foreign aid funding for 90 days.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-to-discuss-potential-suspension-cancellation-of-military-aid-for-ukraine-on-march-3/	2025-03-03T01:09:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2201915640.jpg
France, UK working on developing one month truce plan for Ukraine, Macron tells Le Figaro	French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer are working on a plan to reach a one-month truce in Ukraine, Macron told Le Figaro on March 2. Macron&apos;s statement comes after European leaders met in London to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, and restoring dialogue between the Ukrainian and U.S. governments following the heated argument between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House last week. Ground and maritime operations, as well as energy infrastructure, would be part of a potential truce plan, Macron told Le Figaro. A peacekeeping forces will be deployed on the ground only at the second stage of the plan&apos;s implementation, according to Macron. &quot;There will be no European troops on Ukrainian soil in the coming weeks,&quot; he added. But an unnamed British official denied that such a truce had been agreed upon in London, adding there was not yet agreement on the timing of any potential ceasefire. Macron added that the European Union must also allocate an additional 200 billion euros ($208 billion) to strengthen its defense capabilities in light of a possible U.S. rollback and further Russian threats. EU countries have to set a target for defense investment of 3%-3.5% of GDP, the French president said. He added defense funds are expected to come through &quot;innovative financing,&quot; including joint loans and other EU mechanisms. These issues will be on the agenda of the emergency European summit on March 6. According to Macron, the EU is also seeking to provide Ukraine with an emergency military aid package worth 20 billion euros ($21 billion) at the meeting in Brussels. While most European leaders publicly voiced support for Zelensky after his spat with Trump, Starmer called both the Ukrainian and U.S. leaders in an attempt to bridge the rift. The prime minister reportedly aims to tell Zelensky that fixing relations with Trump would be necessary to ensure lasting peace. The British prime minister and Macron, who visited Washington earlier the previous week, are seeking to mend the ties between Kyiv and the U.S. and present a united front on Ukraine and Russia. European leaders had previously been sidelined from talks between the U.S. and Russia &#x2014; concerned that neither the EU nor Kyiv will have a role in negotiating a ceasefire in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/france-uk-working-on-developing-truce-plan-for-ukraine-le-figaro-reports/	2025-03-02T23:51:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184127273.jpg
Ufimsky oil refinery 1,400km inside Russia catches fire, local authorities report	A large fire broke out overnight at the Ufimsky oil refinery in the Russian city of Ufa some 1,400 kilometers inside Russia, local authorities reported on March 3. Regional emergency services said the fire had been extinguished, adding: &quot;No excess of harmful substances has been recorded near the plant.&quot; No cause was given but Ukrainian forces have repeatedly launched a series of drone strikes aimed at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry beginning in the spring of 2024. Russian Telegram channels reported an explosion at the refinery before the fire broke out. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the reports.

Americans split on Ukraine, CBS News poll finds	U.S. respondents are split between supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression, an opinion poll published by CBS News on March 2 found. The White House has dramatically changed its approach to foreign policy following the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump on Jan. 20. The U.S. leader and President Volodymyr Zelensky got into a heated argument in the Oval Office at a meeting on Feb. 28. Most interviews were held prior to Zelensky&apos;s meeting with Trump on Feb. 28. 52% of respondents said they backed Ukraine in its fight against Russia. 44% of respondents said they were neutral, and 4% of respondents outwardly backed Russia, according to a poll by CBS News. 46% of respondents thought that Trump favors Russia. Most of these respondents support Ukraine. 43% of respondents believe Trump has treated Ukraine and Russia equally. These respondents overwhelmingly hold a neutral stance toward Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Only 11% of respondents thought that Trump favors Ukraine. Some 51% of respondents approve of how Trump has handled Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, while 49% disapprove. 34% of respondents consider Russia an enemy and 32% see Russia as unfriendly, but 34% of respondents consider Russia an ally, or at least friendly. Among those who identified as Republican, opinions towards Russia were slightly more favorable. 27% saw Russia as an enemy and an unchanged 32% saw Russia as unfriendly. 41% of respondents saw Russia as friendly or an ally among Republicans. The poll found that 51% of Americans support military aid to Ukraine, and 49% oppose it. Among those who identify as Democrats, 72% support military aid to Ukraine and only 28% oppose it. Among Republicans, 32% support military aid to Ukraine, and 68% oppose it. U.S. President Donald Trump said he is &quot;for both Ukraine and Russia&quot; during a press conference with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House on Feb. 28. Talking about his role in negotiations to end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Trump said he was &quot;in the middle.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m for both Ukraine and Russia... I want to get it solved,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/americans-split-on-ukraine-cbs-news-poll-finds/	2025-03-02T21:40:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2147967390.jpg
No consensus among EU states on giving frozen Russian assets to Ukraine, Tusk says	The EU does not have a united stance on giving Ukraine frozen Russian assets, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on March 2 at a London summit focused on Ukraine. Western nations froze $300 billion in Russian assets at the onset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Ukraine has only received loans covered by interest earned from the frozen assets. &quot;Everyone understands it would be best to transfer these funds for the purpose of defense and reconstruction of Ukraine,&quot; Tusk said. The freeze on Russian assets in the EU is due to expire in June. Tusk called for the EU to extend the sanctions against Russian assets amid fears of opposition from Hungary which has repeatedly clashed with the EU over implementing sanctions against Russia. &quot;We need to focus on extending the sanctions, because they are working,&quot; Tusk said. The EU must maintain sanctions against Russia. Sanctions are contributing to Russian economic and financial weakness, Tusk added. &quot;There are fears of negative consequences for the euro and the banking system,&quot; the leader said. Poland is calling for other EU member states to support transferring Russian assets to Ukraine but does not have a decisive voice as it is not part of the eurozone, Tusk added. Currently, interest earned on frozen Russian assets is being used to help Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression, the leader said. Leadership in Hungary and Slovakia have spread pro-Russian narratives on many occasions and have repeatedly opposed support for Ukraine from the EU. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban urged EU leaders to abandon a joint statement in support of Ukraine ahead of a summit on March 6.	https://kyivindependent.com/no-consensus-among-eu-states-on-giving-frozen-russian-assets-to-ukraine-tusk-says/	2025-03-02T19:56:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/Tusk.jpg
US FBI Director accuses Zelensky of lack of transparency, pushes for Ukraine aid audit	Kash Patel, the newly Trump-nominated director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), called on US Congress to investigate how aid money sent to Ukraine has been used, The Epoch Times reported on March 2. &quot;I&apos;ve asked this Congress to investigate where this money has gone. The American people are owed that answer because it&#x2019;s our money. It&#x2019;s our taxpayer dollars,&quot; Patel said. Opinion polls show that Americans significantly overestimate the proportion of the U.S. federal budget that is spent on foreign aid, believing it to be around 25 percent when in fact it was only around 1 percent in 2023, amounting to just 0.25% of GDP. He also criticized the scale of U.S. aid to Ukraine. &quot;The issue is not about the U.S. sending a billion dollars, but rather that the amount sent to one country is one hundred times that billion.&quot; Patel then questioned Zelensky&#x2019;s credibility, and referenced a missile incident in Poland. &#x201C;Zelensky went on the world stage and said &#x2018;Russia fired a rocket into Poland,&apos; which would be an act of war. It turned out that Russia fired no such rocket,&#x201D; Patel claimed. Poland has scrambled jets amid Russian attacks on Ukraine several times over the past year, as missiles sent to western Ukraine have violated Polish airspace. He concluded with further skeptical statements and additional calls to investigate Ukrainian funds. &quot;We just can&#x2019;t have full faith and trust in giving a leader $100 billion and then having him say, &apos;I&#x2019;m not telling you where the money went.&apos;&#x201D; Patel concluded. Numerous U.S. government organizations have been keeping up with oversight and transparency measures of aid to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion. Aside from military aid, U.S. funds have been vital in supporting numerous Ukrainian programs and initiatives. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, the U.S. Agency for International Development&apos;s (USAID) has provided Ukraine with $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support, helping to rebuild schools after Russian attacks, pay for bomb shelters, advanced medical equipment for hospitals and much more. USAID&apos;s efforts have also included supporting judicial reforms and anti-corruption initiatives, and promoting transparency and accountability in governance. On Feb. 26 however, the Trump administration announced that it would be terminating over 90% of USAID foreign aid contracts, cutting $60 billion in foreign assistance. Patel previously served as a federal prosecutor, and he held various intelligence positions in Trump&#x2019;s first administration. He has been considered a Trump loyalist, and his views align with the current administration&#x2019;s escalating criticisms of President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s government, including Trump&#x2019;s recent false claims that the U.S. has sent $350 billion in assistance to Ukraine. Patel also received $25,000 in 2024 from a film company run by pro-Kremlin filmmaker Igor Lopatonok, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Feb. 7. The payment came after Patel participated in a documentary about Trump that aired on TCN, the online network of right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-fbi-director-accuses-zelensky-of-lack-of-transparency-pushes-for-ukraine-aid-audit/	2025-03-02T17:56:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196773597.jpg
Canada imposes new sanctions against Russia	Canada introduced new sanctions on March 2 against 10 Russian individuals and 21 entities, including paramilitary groups. The sanctions were announced by the Office of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, following his participation the same day in the European leaders&#x2019; summit in London. Canada&#x2019;s new sanctions target leaders of post-Wagner paramilitary organizations, a senior Russian military official, and several groups operating in Ukraine and Africa, as well as entities involved in resource extraction within these networks. &quot;To date, Canada has imposed sanctions on over 3,000 individuals and entities complicit in Russia&#x2019;s aggression &#x2013; and we remain committed to working with our partners to increase economic pressure on Russia,&quot; the statement said. &#x201C;Canada&#x2019;s commitment to Ukraine is unwavering.&#x201D; The summit included leaders and senior representatives of 15 countries, invited by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to discuss a path toward a just and lasting peace in Ukraine in the face of Russia&#x2019;s war. Zelensky arrived in London following his trip to the U.S. Ukraine&apos;s leader left Washington without signing the much-anticipated natural resources deal after a public spat with U.S. President Donald Trump, prompting shock and concerns about the future of U.S.-Ukraine ties.	https://kyivindependent.com/canada-imposes-new-sanctions-against-russia-2/	2025-03-02T16:18:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1749110905.jpg

Zelensky will have no choice but to concede' — Trump reposts commentary claiming mineral deal ensures Ukraine's security	U.S. President Donald Trump reposted a claim on his social media network Truth Social on March 2 that President Volodymyr Zelensky &quot;will have no choice but to concede&quot; to Washington&apos;s terms to the mineral deal because Kyiv cannot survive the war without U.S. backing. The reposted commentary, initially published by Michael McCune, comes after his public spat with Zelensky in the White House on Feb. 28 that upended plans to sign a natural resources treaty between the two countries. &quot;Trump played both sides liked a master chess player. In the end, Zelensky will have no choice but to concede because, without U.S. support, Ukraine cannot win a prolonged war against Russia,&quot; Trump reposted on his Truth Social network. &quot;Trump is actually protecting Ukraine without dragging the U.S. into war,&quot; the commentary read, presenting the deal as &quot;genius.&quot; The televised quarrel between Trump, his Vice President JD Vance, and Zelensky erupted after the Ukrainian president stressed the need for security guarantees and said that the Kremlin has repeatedly violated ceasefires, leading to the U.S. officials berating him as ungrateful and in a weak position. Following the heated exchange, Trump said that Zelensky is &quot;not a man who wants to make peace.&quot; Trump told reporters on Feb. 28 that Ukrainian president was &quot;looking for something that I&apos;m not looking for&quot; and again asserted that Zelenskyy wanted to &quot;fight, fight, fight.&quot; Zelensky pushed back on Trump&apos;s comments during an interview with Fox News asserting that Ukraine is &quot;ready for peace but we need to be in a good position.&quot; &quot;We want peace... that&apos;s why I visited President Trump,&quot; Zelensky said. In his post, Trump claimed that U.S. business interests in Ukraine would be enough of a security guarantee as Russia would not be able to threaten them &quot;without triggering massive international consequences.&quot; &quot;(B)ecause attacking Ukraine would mean endangering American lives - something that would force the U.S. to respond.&quot; A number of U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers are continuing their defense of Trump while hurling criticisms of Zelensky following the exchange, with some suggesting that Zelensky may have to resign. During an interview with NBC News on March 2, House Speaker Mike Johnson took aim at Zelensky suggesting he &quot;needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country.&quot; White House national security advisor Mike Waltz also criticized Zelensky on March 2, stating that &quot;We need a leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians and end this war.&quot; Waltz, in a comment to far-right media outlet Breitbart News on March 1, compared Zelensky to &quot;an ex-girlfriend that wants to argue everything that you said.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-zelensky-mineral-deal/	2025-03-02T12:35:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201830848.jpg
‘We need to get the U.S. back on track:’ Ukrainian businesses, economists react to mineral deal failure	An agreement on Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources collapsed after a heated argument in the Oval Office on Feb. 28 between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump and his Vice President JD Vance, casting doubt on the deal&#x2019;s future. Following weeks of tough negotiations, Kyiv and Washington eventually came to an agreement on Ukraine&#x2019;s critical minerals, oil, gas, and infrastructure. After the Trump Administration dropped some of Kyiv&#x2019;s major objections to earlier versions of the deal, the Zelensky administration said it was ready to move forward with the agreement, despite the absence of security guarantees. That all fell apart after Zelensky traveled to Washington to sign the agreement in what was supposed to be a first step in jointly developing Ukraine&#x2019;s resources. Instead, a press conference descended into Vance and Trump berating Zelensky, ending with the Ukrainian president being escorted out of the White House without an agreement in hand. While Trump and his VP&#x2019;s tirade against the Ukrainian president sets a firm wedge between the allies, Ukrainian businessmen and economists do not believe all is lost. Ukraine is still ready to offer up its resources for American investment, meaning another round of negotiations is possible once emotions cool off, they say. &#x201C;While political messaging might shift, the core economic and business relationships between the two countries remain resilient,&#x201D; Hennadiy Chyzhykov, president of the Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce, told the Kyiv Independent. The resources deal has been a rough road littered with controversies. Trump&#x2019;s initial demands would have given Washington as much control over Ukraine&#x2019;s main sources of revenue as the Ukrainian government. Critics accused the U.S. of offering a colonial-style deal. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz slammed Trump for being &#x201C;selfish.&#x201D; Throughout the weeks of talks, Zelensky reiterated he wouldn&#x2019;t give up Ukraine&#x2019;s resources without security guarantees, while Trump labelled Zelensky &#x201C;a dictator,&#x201D; seemingly in response to his unwillingness to sign the agreement. The last agreement, dated Feb. 25, still didn&#x2019;t offer any guarantees for protection against Russian aggression, but it did promise a more equal economic partnership to develop Ukraine&#x2019;s resources. Many in Ukraine were cautiously optimistic that it could work out, funneling much-needed capital into Ukraine. Following the drama in Washington, the Kyiv Independent spoke to Ukraine&#x2019;s business community to get their take on the fate of the deal and U.S.-Ukraine relations. What we are seeing now is a phase of recalibration in U.S.- Ukraine relations. While political debates and shifts in messaging can create uncertainty, strategic agreements &#x2014; especially those related to critical resources &#x2014; are rarely abandoned overnight. The U.S. and Ukraine both recognize the mutual benefits of energy and resource cooperation, and I expect that discussions will continue with an adjusted framework, potentially involving more European and private sector stakeholders. Ukraine&#x2019;s resource potential remains immense, and the global demand for critical minerals is only growing. While a slowdown in negotiations with the U.S. could momentarily delay some opportunities, it also opens the door for broader diversification. Ukraine is actively engaging with European and Asian partners, and this moment may encourage a more balanced approach &#x2014; ensuring that we leverage multiple partnerships rather than relying too heavily on any single agreement. The U.S.-Ukraine relationship has proven to be resilient despite changes in political leadership and diplomatic challenges. It is important to separate political rhetoric from long-term strategic interests &#x2014; support for Ukraine, whether military, economic, or political, remains a bipartisan priority for many in Washington.It&#x2019;s also worth noting that international relations are dynamic. Moments of tension often lead to more structured and sustainable agreements in the long run. This is not a breakdown but rather a recalibration of expectations and priorities. The most important thing is that discussions are ongoing, stakeholders are engaged, and there is a shared interest in de-escalation and finding mutually beneficial solutions.

(Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Arseniy Yatsenyuk &#x2014; economist, former Prime Minister of Ukraine, and founder of the Open Ukraine FoundationWe urgently need to develop a roadmap on how to fix the situation we all find ourselves in. Neither Ukraine nor the Trump administration has benefited from this, only the war criminal (Russian President Vladimir) Putin. It is better to sign this (resources) agreement as soon as possible to show that Ukraine is ready for any kind of investment. If the U.S. president needs this deal to &quot;sell&quot; it to his MAGA base, we are okay with this. But we need real investments and economic cooperation. However, this deal has nothing to do with a real peace process. It is necessary to define the terms of this peace agreement that will meet the demands of Ukraine and international law. Everyone has to be on the same page &#x2014; the European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Ukraine, with the Russians on the other side of the aisle.We need to undertake enormous efforts to get the U.S. back on track.The president of Ukraine, together with our friends and partners from the EU and the U.K., should send a letter to the U.S. administration clearly defining the red lines that Ukraine will never accept.I would strongly recommend that our European friends make the terms of the peace deal framework public. We must clearly see what red lines are being set by the European Union and Ukraine. Ukraine will never accept any kind of legalization of any territorial concessions. Ukraine will never accept any disarmament. We need to work out in detail the issue of NATO and our membership perspective. We can discuss the timeframe of this, but this is the ultimate goal of Ukraine. These red lines should be clearly set in a joint statement by the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine and sent to the White House. There were, unfortunately, no security guarantees in the resources agreement, but it was a step in the right direction. So I was really upset and disappointed. I don&#x2019;t feel it&#x2019;s the end. I believe that a reasonable second round should be prepared. From the business point of view, I believe that U.S. Investment will help to develop the country like it did previously with South Korea, Japan, and Singapore.We should sign the resources agreement. It will be the first step. But nowadays it&apos;s much more difficult because it&apos;s more emotional. For Zelensky, the security question is much more important, but this pragmatic approach from the Trump administration is now prevailing. Ukraine could have a lot of interest both from European and U.S. investment after the war and could be one of the hottest places on the planet if it is clear that the war is stoppedI still think it&apos;s in America&#x2019;s interest to be on the Ukrainian side, and I think we should find a way to save Trump and Zelensky&#x2019;s faces and relaunch this relationship. It&#x2019;s very important for Ukraine. US President Donald Trump greets Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky as he arrives at the White House in Washington, DC. Feb. 28, 2025. (Tierney L. / Getty Images)Andrey Stavnitser &#x2014; co-owner and CEO of TIS Port and founder of Superhumans CenterEmotionally, this (dispute) was incredibly unpleasant. Of course, we are all capable of putting emotions aside, but a conversation that starts with a sarcastic question like &quot;Don&#x2019;t you own a suit?&quot; is hard to call constructive or respectful. Ukraine considers the United States a crucial ally, and we are deeply grateful to the American people and authorities at all levels for the immense support they have provided us over the years. Truth and justice must prevail; if the outcome is different, we will have to acknowledge that we are living in a world entirely different from the one we believed we inhabited. I am confident that we, along with European leaders and the United States, have the wisdom and strength to stand on the side of justice. I won&#x2019;t claim to have deep expertise to fully assess the resources agreement, but as far as I can judge, its main value lies in the declaration of the United States&apos; intent to continue supporting Ukraine, also within the framework of business interests. This is an important agreement, but it is a framework one and depends entirely on the relationships and goodwill of the parties.It could become a more powerful tool for Ukraine&#x2019;s protection only if hundreds, if not thousands, of further negotiations are successful and satisfactory for both sides, hypothetically leading someday to something more concrete in establishing a strong, long-term, and fair peace. The discussion (on Feb. 28) immediately went in a direction that does not suggest any positive steps moving forward. Nevertheless, Ukraine is still ready to sign the agreement &#x2014; peace is what we need the most.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-need-to-get-the-u-s-back-on-track-ukrainian-businesses-economists-react-to-mineral-deal-failure/	2025-03-02T12:26:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201823899.jpg
Trump-Zelensky clash and US talks with Russia | Ukraine This Week	In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Anna Belokur breaks down the shocking argument that took place in the Oval Office on Friday, in which U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for a perceived lack of gratitude for American assistance to Ukraine. The event has raised alarm bells regarding the future of peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, and indicates a worryingly pro-Russian tilt by the current American administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-zelensky-clash-and-us-talks-with-russia-ukraine-this-week/	2025-03-02T12:03:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_0749.JPG
Zelensky meets with King Charles following European leaders' summit	President Volodymyr Zelensky met with King Charles III on March 2 following the conclusion of the European leaders&apos; summit hosted by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The meeting, which sources tell BBC News lasted just under an hour, comes as a show of support for the leader of the embattled country amid the fallout of Zelensky&apos;s heated meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. European leaders converged in London on March 2 to reaffirm their support for Kyiv and discuss how to strengthen support for Ukraine and ensure a just and lasting peace. Earlier in the day, Starmer said that a number of European nations, including the U.K. and France, are developing a &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; that will include &quot;planes in the air and boots on the ground&quot; in an effort to negotiate a successful ceasefire in Ukraine. Starmer added that for any coalition to succeed, Europe must &quot;have strong U.S. backing.&quot; While most European leaders publicly voiced support for Zelensky after his spat with Trump, Starmer called both the Ukrainian and U.S. leaders in an attempt to bridge the rift. The prime minister reportedly aims to tell Zelensky that fixing relations with Trump would be necessary to ensure lasting peace. Amid Starmer&apos;s visit to the U.S. to meet Trump on Feb. 27, King Charles invited Trump to an &quot;unprecedented&quot; second state visit to meet the Royals. Trump previously visited the United Kingdom in his first term in office on the invitation of Queen Elizabeth II. Zelensky previously met with Britain&apos;s King Charles on July 18.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-with-king-charles-following-european-leaders-summit/	2025-03-02T11:36:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/gettyimages-2202274012-612x612.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Europe developing 'coalition of the willing' to back ceasefire in Ukraine, Starmer says	Key developments on March 1 - 2: U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on March 2 that a number of European nations, including the U.K. and France, are developing a &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; that will include &quot;planes in the air and boots on the ground&quot; in an effort to negotiate a successful ceasefire in Ukraine. Starmer added that for any coalition to succeed, Europe must &quot;have strong U.S. backing.&quot; &quot;(European allies) will go forth to develop a &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; to defend a deal in Ukraine and to guarantee the peace,&quot; Starmer said during a press conference following a European leaders summit in London. &quot;Not every nation will feel able to contribute but that can&apos;t mean we sit back. Instead those willing will intensify planning now with real urgency.&quot; &quot;The U.K is prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air. Together with others, Europe must do the heavy lifting,&quot; Starmer said. &quot;This is not a moment for more talk... If you want to preserve the peace, you have to defend the peace.&quot; Starmer is hosting President Volodymyr Zelensky and other leaders in London to discuss how to strengthen support for Ukraine and ensure a just and lasting peace. The summit is even more crucial now after a fallout between the Ukrainian leader and U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House. The U.K. and France have spearheaded the idea of deploying European peacekeepers in Ukraine to monitor a potential ceasefire. French President Emmanuel Macron and Starmer appealed to Trump to remain involved in maintaining a post-war order, but they failed to receive any concrete commitments as the new U.S. administration expects Europe to take responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security. Starmer said that he spoke to Trump on March 1 to deliver plans of the proposed coalition, and added that the proposed coalition will succeed on the basis that Europe work &quot;with the U.S. and that it will have U.S. backing.&quot; Starmer did not specify which other countries would participate in the coalition, but added that &quot;a number of countries have indicated they want to be part of the plan we&apos;re developing.&quot; &quot;The purpose of today&apos;s meeting was to unite our partners around this effort. To strengthen Ukraine, and unsure a just and enduring peace for the good of all of us,&quot; Starmer added. &quot;We have to learn from the mistakes of the past. We cannot accept a deal like Minsk which Russia can break with ease.&quot; While most European leaders publicly voiced support for Zelensky after his spat with Trump, Starmer called both the Ukrainian and U.S. leaders in an attempt to bridge the rift. The prime minister reportedly aims to tell Zelensky that fixing relations with Trump would be necessary to ensure lasting peace. The British prime minister and Macron, who visited Washington earlier this week, are seeking to mend the ties between Kyiv and the U.S. and present a united front on Ukraine and Russia. European leaders had previously been sidelined from talks between the U.S. and Russia &#x2014; concerned that neither the EU nor Kyiv will have a role in negotiating a ceasefire in Ukraine. The United Kingdom signed an agreement with Kyiv on March 1 to provide Ukraine with a loan worth 2.26 billion pounds ($2.84 billion) backed by frozen Russian assets. The loan, which is part of the Group of Seven&apos;s (G7) Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) credit initiative, was signed amid Zelensky&apos;s visit to London to meet with Starmer. &quot;The United Kingdom continues to stand in defense of Ukraine. Today&apos;s agreement, which contributes to strengthening Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities, confirms this,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko said in a statement. The loan will go towards &quot;purchasing defense equipment according to Ukraine&apos;s needs,&quot; the Finance Ministry said. In October 2024, G7 countries came to an agreement that pledged to provide Ukraine with almost $50 billion loan. The United States will contribute the bulk of the loan with $20 billion in assistance. The U.S. is closely followed by European Union countries, including France, Germany, and Italy, with a combined $19.4 billion. The remaining approximately $10 billion will be divvied up with Canada providing $3.7 billion, Japan providing $3.07 billion, and the U.K. providing $2.8 billion in loan funding. Under the G7 ERA initiative, Ukraine had previously received $1 billion from the U.S. and $3.1 billion from the EU. While Western countries have frozen $300 billion in Russian assets, they can only access the annual income generated by these funds, approximately $3.2 billion. These profits will back the $50-billion loan to Kyiv, while the vast majority of the assets are frozen in European countries. In January, Zelensky and Starmer signed a 100-year partnership agreement during their meeting in Kyiv on Jan. 16. The wide-ranging deal encompasses cooperation in military, energy, scientific, cultural, economic, and other sectors. Earlier in the day, Starmer, in line with European allies, reaffirmed his country&apos;s support for Ukraine and Zelensky. &quot;We stand with Ukraine for as long as it may take,&quot; Starmer told reporters at a press briefing alongside Zelensky, adding that Ukraine has &quot;full backing across the United Kingdom.&quot; Starmer and Macron are working behind the scenes to pacify relations between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Volodymyr Zelensky following their public spat on Feb. 28. Macron has spoken with both Zelensky and Trump privately, telling La Tribune Dimanche in an interview published on March 1 that he took the initiative to mediate because &quot;what is at stake is too important.&quot; &quot;The manifest destiny of the Americans is to be on the side of the Ukrainians, I have no doubt about it. What the United States has done over the past three years is entirely consistent with its diplomatic and military tradition,&quot; Macron said. &quot;I want to make the Americans understand that disengagement from Ukraine is not in their interest.&quot; Macron also cautioned against signing a peace deal without any security guarantees for Ukraine, adding that &quot;geostrategic deterrence capacity with regard to Russia, China and others, would vanish the same day .&quot; If Russia&apos;s full-scale war of aggression is not stopped in Ukraine, it will &quot;surely go to Moldova&quot; and &quot;perhaps beyond to Romania,&quot; the French president added. Both the U.K. and France have supported the idea of deploying peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of the country&apos;s security guarantees. Starmer announced on March 2 that the U.K. had reached an agreement with Kyiv to provide Ukraine with 1.6 billion pounds ($2 billion) for the purchase of 5,000 air defense missiles. Starmer said that the deal would be conducted through export financing, with the missiles being produced in Belfast, Northern Ireland. &quot;This will be vital for protecting critical infrastructure now and strengthening Ukraine in securing the peace when it comes,&quot; Starmer said. The deal, which Starmer announced during a press conference following the conclusion of a European leaders&apos; summit in London, follows a separate commitment announced on March 1 that would provide a $2.8 billion loan backed by frozen Russian assets. Ukraine has long been calling for allies to provide additional funding for Ukraine&apos;s air defense needs as Russia continues to pummel Ukrainian cities with missile and drone attacks. A number of U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers are continuing their criticism of Zelensky, with some suggesting that Zelensky may have to resign, following the president&apos;s heated exchange at the White House with Trump on Feb. 28. During an interview with NBC News on March 2, House Speaker Mike Johnson took aim at Zelensky suggesting he &quot;needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country.&quot; &quot;What President Zelensky did in the White House was effectively a signal to us that he&#x2019;s not ready for (peace talks), and I think that&#x2019;s a great disappointment,&quot; Johnson said. Johnson&apos;s remarks fall in line with Senator Lindsey Graham &#x2014; formerly a staunch supporter of Ukraine &#x2014; who said on Feb. 28 that Zelensky &quot;is either going to have to fundamentally change or go.&quot; Zelensky rebuked calls for his resignation from Republican lawmakers following the exchange, saying on Fox News that &quot;only Ukrainians vote for their president.&quot; U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has defended Trump since the incident, also criticized Zelensky in separate interview with ABC News on March 2, stating that the United States will &quot;be ready to reengage when they&#x2019;re ready to make peace.&quot; Rubio added that he has not spoken to Zelensky or members of the Ukrainian delegation since they were ordered to leave the White House. Rubio&apos;s comments echo those of Trump who told reporters following the spat that the Ukrainian president was &quot;looking for something that I&apos;m not looking for&quot; and again asserted that Zelenskyy wanted to &quot;fight, fight, fight.&quot; Zelensky pushed back on Trump&apos;s comments during his interview asserting that Ukraine is &quot;ready for peace but we need to be in a good position.&quot; &quot;We want peace... that&apos;s why I visited President Trump,&quot; Zelensky added. White House national security advisor Mike Waltz also criticized Zelensky on March 2, stating that &quot;We need a leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians and end this war.&quot; When asked if Trump wanted Zelensky to resign, Waltz declined to directly answer the question, responding that &quot;If it becomes apparent that President Zelenskyy&#x2019;s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in his country, then I think we have a real issue on our hands.&quot; Waltz, in a comment to far-right media outlet Breitbart News on March 1, compared Zelensky to &quot;an ex-girlfriend that wants to argue everything that you said.&quot; The Kremlin has praised what it perceives as the U.S.&apos;s foreign policy shift, claiming on March 2 that it &quot;aligns&quot; with its &quot;vision&quot; after Trump&apos;s public dispute with Zelensky. &quot;The new administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations. This largely coincides with our vision,&quot; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in comments published by state-controlled media. &quot;There is a long way to go, because there is huge damage to the whole complex of bilateral relations. But if the political will of the two leaders, President (Vladimir) Putin and President Trump, is maintained, this path can be quite quick and successful.&quot; Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also praised Trump, calling him a &quot;pragmatist&quot; and adding that &quot;that&apos;s what makes him interesting,&quot; state-controlled media reported on March 2. Lavrov claimed that the Trump administration&apos;s so-called common sense approach dictates &quot;stepping aside&quot; from aiding Ukraine. Trump, echoing Kremlin rhetoric on the war in Ukraine, said at the end of February the country should &quot;forget&quot; about joining NATO, which the country sees as a security guarantee against a future Russian invasion. Russia has repeatedly presented NATO expansion as a &quot;justification&quot; for the war. Overlooking the challenges of holding elections in a war zone, Trump on Feb. 19 called Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot;&#x2014;a remark he later claimed he did not remember making. The U.S. also voted alongside Russia on Feb. 24 against a U.N. resolution that condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-europe-developing-coalition-of-the-willing-to-back-ceasefire-in-ukraine-starmer-says/	2025-03-02T11:16:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/gettyimages-2202283308-612x612.jpg
U.K. to provide Ukraine with $2 billion for air defense	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced on March 2 that the U.K. had reached an agreement with Kyiv to provide Ukraine with 1.6 billion pounds ($2 billion) for the purchase of 5,000 air defense missiles. Although the terms of the agreement were not immediately available, Starmer said that the deal would be conducted through export financing, with the missiles being produced in Belfast, Northern Ireland. &quot;This will be vital for protecting critical infrastructure now and strengthening Ukraine in securing the peace when it comes,&quot; Starmer said. The deal, which Starmer announced during a press conference following the conclusion of a European leaders&apos; summit in London, follows a separate commitment announced on March 1 that would provide a $2.8 billion loan backed by frozen Russian assets. Ukraine has long been calling for allies to provide additional funding for Ukraine&apos;s air defense needs as Russia continues to pummel Ukrainian cities with missile and drone attacks. Starmer on March 2 hosted President Volodymyr Zelensky and other leaders in London to discuss how to strengthen support for Ukraine and ensure a just and lasting peace. The summit is even more crucial now after a fallout between the Ukrainian leader and U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House. Earlier in the press conference, Starmer announced that a number of European nations, including the U.K. and France, are developing a &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; that will include &quot;planes in the air and boots on the ground&quot; in an effort to negotiate a successful ceasefire in Ukraine. Starmer said that he spoke to Trump on March 1 to deliver plans of the proposed coalition, and added that the proposed coalition will succeed on the basis that Europe work &quot;with the U.S. and that it will have U.S. backing.&quot; In January, Zelensky and Starmer signed a 100-year partnership agreement during their meeting in Kyiv on Jan. 16. The wide-ranging deal encompasses cooperation in military, energy, scientific, cultural, economic, and other sectors.	https://kyivindependent.com/u-k-to-provide-ukraine-with-2-billion-for-air-defense/	2025-03-02T10:34:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193601148.jpg
Europe developing 'coalition of the willing' to back ceasefire in Ukraine, Starmer says	U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on March 2 that a number of European nations, including the U.K. and France, are developing a &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; that will include &quot;planes in the air and boots on the ground&quot; in an effort to negotiate a successful ceasefire in Ukraine. Starmer added that for any coalition to succeed, Europe must &quot;have strong U.S. backing.&quot; &quot;(European allies) will go forth to develop a &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; to defend a deal in Ukraine and to guarantee the peace,&quot; Starmer said during a press conference following a European leaders summit in London. &quot;Not every nation will feel able to contribute but that can&apos;t mean we sit back. Instead those willing will intensify planning now with real urgency.&quot; &quot;The U.K is prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air. Together with others, Europe must do the heavy lifting,&quot; Starmer said. &quot;This is not a moment for more talk... If you want to preserve the peace, you have to defend the peace.&quot; Starmer is hosting President Volodymyr Zelensky and other leaders in London to discuss how to strengthen support for Ukraine and ensure a just and lasting peace. The summit is even more crucial now after a fallout between the Ukrainian leader and U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House. The U.K. and France have spearheaded the idea of deploying European peacekeepers in Ukraine to monitor a potential ceasefire. French President Emmanuel Macron and Starmer appealed to Trump to remain involved in maintaining a post-war order, but they failed to receive any concrete commitments as the new U.S. administration expects Europe to take responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security. Starmer said that he spoke to Trump on March 1 to deliver plans of the proposed coalition, and added that the proposed coalition will succeed on the basis that Europe work &quot;with the U.S. and that it will have U.S. backing.&quot; Starmer did not specify which other countries would participate in the coalition, but added that &quot;a number of countries have indicated they want to be part of the plan we&apos;re developing.&quot; &quot;The purpose of today&apos;s meeting was to unite our partners around this effort. To strengthen Ukraine, and unsure a just and enduring peace for the good of all of us,&quot; Starmer added. &quot;We have to learn from the mistakes of the past. We cannot accept a deal like Minsk which Russia can break with ease.&quot; While most European leaders publicly voiced support for Zelensky after his spat with Trump, Starmer called both the Ukrainian and U.S. leaders in an attempt to bridge the rift. The prime minister reportedly aims to tell Zelensky that fixing relations with Trump would be necessary to ensure lasting peace. The British prime minister and French President Emmanuel Macron, who visited Washington earlier this week, are seeking to mend the ties between Kyiv and the U.S. and present a united front on Ukraine and Russia. European leaders had previously been sidelined from talks between the U.S. and Russia &#x2014; concerned that neither the EU nor Kyiv will have a role in negotiating a ceasefire in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-developing-coalition-of-the-willing-to-back-ceasefire-in-ukraine-starmer-says/	2025-03-02T10:04:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194219228.jpg
Top US officials, lawmakers lambast Zelensky over White House clash with Trump	A number of U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers are continuing their criticism of President Volodymyr Zelensky, with some suggesting that Zelensky may have to resign, following the president&apos;s heated exchange at the White House with U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 28. During an interview with NBC News on March 2, House Speaker Mike Johnson took aim at Zelensky suggesting he &quot;needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country.&quot; &quot;What President Zelensky did in the White House was effectively a signal to us that he&#x2019;s not ready for (peace talks), and I think that&#x2019;s a great disappointment,&quot; Johnson said. Johnson&apos;s remarks fall in line with Senator Lindsey Graham &#x2014; formerly a staunch supporter of Ukraine &#x2014; who said on Feb. 28 that Zelensky &quot;is either going to have to fundamentally change or go.&quot; Zelensky rebuked calls for his resignation from Republican lawmakers following the exchange, saying on Fox News that &quot;only Ukrainians vote for their president.&quot; U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has defended Trump since the incident, also criticized Zelensky in separate interview with ABC News on March 2, stating that the United States will &quot;be ready to reengage when they&#x2019;re ready to make peace.&quot; Rubio added that he has not spoken to Zelensky or members of the Ukrainian delegation since they were ordered to leave the White House.

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in an interview with the BBC on March 2 that the U.K., France, Ukraine, and possibly other countries will develop a ceasefire plan that will be presented to the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/top-us-officials-lawmakers-lambast-zelensky-over-white-house-clash-with-trump/	2025-03-02T08:57:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199704911.jpg
Czechs crowdfund money to purchase Black Hawk helicopter for Ukraine	A Czech volunteer initiative announced on March 1 that it had raised enough money to purchase a Black Hawk military helicopter for Ukraine&apos;s war effort. The volunteer initiative, called &quot;A Gift for Putin,&quot; began crowdfunding money for the helicopter in November 2023, rallying more than 20,500 donors to contribute a total of 72.3 million Czech Koruna ($2.9 million). The funds will go toward purchasing a Black Hawk helicopter from the United States, where it is more affordable than in the Czech Republic. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) will operate the Black Hawk for evacuating Ukrainian soldiers and special operations, according to the website. &quot;Ukraine cannot win the war with drones or ammunition alone. It also needs tanks, aircraft, howitzers&#x2014;and helicopters for special operations,&quot; the volunteer initiative&apos;s website reads.	https://kyivindependent.com/czechs-crowdfund-money-to-purchase-black-hawk-helicopter-for-ukraine/	2025-03-02T07:55:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2183850598--1-.jpg
Putin congratulates winner of 'election' in occupied Abkhazia	Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Badra Gunba on winning the presidential &quot;election&quot; in the Russian-occupied Georgian region of Abkhazia in a statement released by the Kremlin&apos;s press service on March 2. &quot;I expect that the friendly, allied Russian-Abkhazian relations will continue to strengthen for the benefit of our brotherly nations,&quot; Putin&apos;s message goes on to read. Abkhazia, an occupied region internationally recognized as part of &#xA0;Georgia, has been under de facto Russian control since the 2008 war between Russia and Georgia. Aslan Bzhania, the former leader of Abkhazia, submitted his resignation on Nov. 19 in a bid to quell mounting unrest over a proposed investment deal with Russia. The agreement, which would allow Russian citizens to purchase property in Abkhazia, fueled fears of deeper Russian entrenchment in the territory and was subsequently scrapped. Gunba, the winner of the presidential &quot;election,&quot; is considered to be a pro-Kremlin politician. Freedom House, a U.S.-based NGO advocating for democracy and political freedom, said that Abkhazia&apos;s legal framework &quot;does not support fully democratic elections,&quot; but noted that &quot;incumbent officials remain vulnerable to defeat at the polls.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-congratulates-winner-of-election-in-occupied-abkhazia/	2025-03-02T07:37:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2157386935.jpg
Reported Russian 'shadow fleet' oil tanker, detained over damaged undersea cables, allowed to leave Finland	The Eagle S oil tanker, which is thought to be part of Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; was allowed to leave Finland&apos;s waters after it was detained on suspicion of sabotaging undersea Baltic cables, the Agence France-Presse news agency reported on March 2. Finnish authorities announced that there were &quot;no longer grounds&quot; to continue detaining the Russian-linked vessel Eagle S, though their criminal investigation remains ongoing. Three of the eight suspected individuals from the ship&apos;s crew have been barred from leaving Finland as authorities continue to probe the incident. In January, the Swedish Navy found an anchor at the site of the sabotaged cables in the Baltic Sea. Finnish authorities suspect the Eagle S intentionally dragged its anchor along dozens of kilometers of the Baltic seabed, according to AFP. The vessel is believed to be part of Russia&#x2019;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; a network of ships that Moscow allegedly uses to circumvent Western sanctions and continue exporting oil and gas. These vessels operate under opaque ownership structures, making them difficult to track and raising significant security and environmental concerns. In mid-January, senior officials from three nations said that recent damage to undersea cables was likely the result of accidents rather than deliberate sabotage by Russia. However, some analysts and officials believe the damage is potentially linked to Russia&#x2019;s broader hybrid warfare strategy&#x2014;a blend of cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, and covert operations to stir discord in the West.	https://kyivindependent.com/reported-russian-shadow-fleet-tanker-allowed-to-leave-finland-after-damaging-baltic-cables/	2025-03-02T07:12:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2192468806.jpg
Zelensky meets Italy's Meloni at London summit	President Volodymyr Zelensky and Italy&apos;s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni held a &quot;productive meeting&quot; on the sidelines of an international summit in London on March 2, the Presidential Office said. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is hosting leaders and top officials from more than a dozen countries, as well as leaders of the EU and NATO, to devise a strategy for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine. &quot;I had a productive meeting with the President of the Council of Ministers of Italy (Giorgia Meloni) to develop a joint action plan for ending the war with a just and lasting peace,&quot; Zelensky said on X. &quot;No one other than (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is interested in the continuation and quick return of the war. Therefore, it is important to maintain unity around Ukraine and strengthen our country&apos;s position in cooperation with our allies &#x2013; the countries of Europe and the United States.&quot; I had a productive meeting with the President of the Council of Ministers of Italy @GiorgiaMeloni to develop a joint action plan for ending the war with a just and lasting peace.No one other than Putin is interested in the continuation and quick return of the war. Therefore, it&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/3xCF7qTiCv Zelensky&apos;s visit to the U.K. follows his calamitous trip to the U.S. While expecting to sign a framework agreement on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources with U.S. President Donald Trump, the visit derailed after he got into a heated argument with Trump and Vice President JD Vance, leaving the deal&apos;s fate uncertain. European leaders have rushed to declare support for Zelensky but also urged him to mend ties with Trump to keep the U.S. engaged in the peace process. Meloni suggested that Italy and the U.K. could act as a bridge between Kyiv and Washington. Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have also reportedly sought to work behind the scenes to ease tensions between the two leaders. &quot;I think it is very important that we avoid the risk that the West divides. And I think on this, the U.K. and Italy can play an important role in bridge building,&quot; Meloni said upon arriving in London for the allied summit, as quoted by the Telegraph.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-italys-meloni-at-ukraine-summit-in-london/	2025-03-02T06:42:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/865809bf3611024ddd634a9f78e002d6_1740925269_extra_large.jpeg
Italy, UK can help mediate Zelensky-Trump dispute, Meloni says	Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on March 2 that Italy and the U.K. could mediate between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump following their dispute on Feb. 28, adding that any continued division &quot;will make us all weaker,&quot; the Telegraph reported. With Washington&#x2019;s role seen as crucial to any lasting peace in Ukraine, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have also reportedly sought to work behind the scenes to ease tensions between the two leaders. &quot;I think it is very important that we avoid the risk that the West divides. And I think on this, the U.K. and Italy can play an important role in bridge building,&quot; Meloni said upon arriving in London for the allied summit, as quoted by the Telegraph. Italy&apos;s prime minister met Starmer at 10 Downing Street for a bilateral talk ahead of the summit to discuss Ukraine, migration, and other topics. Prior to arriving in London, Zelenky was in Washington to sign a natural resources deal with the United States. His visit took a dramatic turn when a heated exchange with Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance led to his expulsion from the White House. The clash erupted after Zelensky publicly stressed the need for security guarantees, citing Russia&#x2019;s repeated violations of ceasefires before its full-scale invasion in 2022. Following the contentious meeting, Trump claimed that Zelensky was &quot;not ready&quot; for peace. Starmer has invited leaders and senior representatives from 15 countries to discuss strategies for securing a just and lasting peace in Ukraine. Meloni believes her close relationship with Trump can help reconcile his relationship with Zelensky, according to the Telegraph.	https://kyivindependent.com/meloni-says-she-can-help-mediate-zelensky-trump-dispute/	2025-03-02T06:24:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202193028.jpg
European leaders gather in London for Ukraine summit after White House fallout	French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, and other top Western officials arrived for a London summit to discuss support for Kyiv, the Guardian reported on March 2. They are among the leaders and senior representatives of 15 countries invited to the U.K. by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to discuss ways to ensure just and lasting peace in Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in London already on March 1 for talks with Starmer after his trip to the U.S. Ukraine&apos;s leader left Washington without signing the much-anticipated natural resources deal following a public spat with U.S. President Donald Trump, which caused a shock across Europe. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have also arrived in the U.K.&apos;s capital, the Guardian wrote. The list of invitees further includes European Council President Antonio Costa and leaders or representatives of Germany, Canada, Czechia, Spain, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Romania, and Turkey. &quot;On my way to London to highlight Europe&#x2019;s ongoing support to Ukraine that can lead to just and lasting peace in Ukraine,&quot; von der Leyen said on X ahead of her trip. &quot;The path to peace is strength. Weakness breeds more war. We will support Ukraine while undertaking a surge in European defense.&quot; The Baltic countries, which have been among Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters throughout the full-scale invasion, were not among the invitees, reportedly leading to Starmer issuing an apology. The summit is seen as a last-ditch effort to revive Western unity after seismic foreign policy shifts in Washington under the Trump administration. Both Starmer and Macron visited the U.S. earlier this week to convince Trump to continue playing a role in Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability, but their diplomatic efforts were overshadowed by the unprecedented public spat in the White House on Feb. 28. The humiliating treatment Zelensky received from the U.S. president and Vice President JD Vance prompted Europe&apos;s leaders to speak out in support of the Ukrainian president. At the same time, a number of top Western officials, including Starmer and Rutte, have openly or privately appealed to Zelensky to mend ties with Trump to ensure continued U.S. engagement. Speaking ahead of the summit, the British prime minister revealed that the U.K., France, and Ukraine will spearhead efforts to create a joint ceasefire plan to present to Trump. The London meeting is also a chance for Ukraine&apos;s EU allies to coordinate strategy ahead of the European summit on March 6, which is under threat of being derailed by Moscow-friendly Hungary and Slovakia.	https://kyivindependent.com/european-leaders-gather-in-london-for-ukraine-summit-after-white-house-fallout/	2025-03-02T05:40:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202195178.jpg
Ukraine calls out IAEA staff for passing via occupied territories but pins blame on Russia	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry protested on March 2 against International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) staff passing through occupied territories to carry out a rotation at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant but blamed the situation on Russian blackmail. Moscow&apos;s &quot;systematic attempts to impose illegal and contradictory operational mechanisms on international organizations&quot; led to &quot;violations of Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty and territorial integrity&quot; by several IAEA staff members, the ministry said. The statement came hours after Russian occupation authorities claimed that a rotation of IAEA personnel had taken place through Russian-controlled territory. Ukraine&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry accused Russia of obstructing the rotation of IAEA staff at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and keeping inspectors under &quot;unprecedented psychological pressure in a high-risk zone.&quot; Inspectors from the IAEA, stationed at the Russian-occupied facility to monitor risks and ensure the safety of operations, are meant to rotate every 80 days. &#xA0;The ministry said Russian forces had blocked staff rotations through Ukrainian-controlled territory. &quot;We consider the actions of the IAEA not as a rotation of experts at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant but as a humanitarian evacuation under conditions that threaten the lives and health of the agency&apos;s staff,&quot; the Foreign Ministry said in an apparent dismissal of the IAEA&apos;s capabilities of handling the situation on the ground. The IAEA has not yet commented. The largest nuclear plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, has been under Russian occupation since 2022. While the facility remains under Russian control, it is not currently generating electricity.	https://kyivindependent.com/foreign-ministry-condemns-iaea/	2025-03-02T05:05:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1243158341.jpg
1 killed, 10 injured after Russian drone drops explosive on bus in Kherson	A Russian drone dropped an explosive on a shuttle bus in the southern city of Kherson on March 2, killing one person and injuring at least 10, the city&apos;s military administration said. A 53-year-old woman was killed in the attack, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. The attack took place in the afternoon in the city&apos;s western Dniprovskyi district. At least nine of the victims have been hospitalized, the regional prosecutor&apos;s office said. Four of them are in serious condition, according to Roman Mrochko, the head of the Kherson city military administration. Kherson and other Ukraine-controlled settlements west of the Dnipro River endure daily Russian attacks as Moscow&apos;s forces maintain control of the river&#x2019;s east bank. Evidence points to Russia systematically targeting civilians in Kherson with drones in a campaign dubbed by journalists as a &quot;human safari.&quot; A Russian drone strike in the city on Jan. 6 targeted another bus, killing one person and injuring eight.	https://kyivindependent.com/1-killed-10-injured-after-russian-drone-drops-bomb-on-bus-in-kherson/	2025-03-02T04:48:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1822097784.jpg
Russia, China seek to recruit fired US federal employees, CNN reports	Russia and China are attempting to recruit U.S. federal employees working in national security who were impacted by the Trump administration&apos;s layoffs, CNN reported on March 1, citing four undisclosed sources and an intelligence report. In efforts spearheaded by Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the U.S. government launched a mass firing of government employees and gutted federal agencies like USAID. These steps, presented as cutting waste and realigning government policies with President Donald Trump&apos;s &quot;America First&quot; agenda, could be followed by further layoffs in the civil service in the near future. Washington&apos;s foreign adversaries are seeking to leverage the situation and recruit employees who were recently fired &#x2014; or are in danger of being laid off &#x2014; and have security clearance or access to sensitive information on critical infrastructure, CNN wrote. Foreign intelligence operatives were instructed to look for potential sources on LinkedIn, TikTok, RedNote, and Reddit, the outlet reported, citing a document by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. The CIA has already fired about 20 officers working in diversity and recruitment, which is seen as only a first step before what the New York Times described as &quot;one of the largest mass firings in the agency&#x2019;s history.&quot; The Pentagon, in turn, announced plans to lay off 5,400 probationary employees, representing roughly 5-8% of its civilian workforce. The last few weeks saw the Trump administration take steps described by critics as friendly toward Moscow, publicly denouncing the Ukrainian leadership and launching direct talks with Russia in a supposed effort to broker a peace deal. According to media reporting, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has also ordered U.S. Cyber Command to suspend offensive cyber and information operations against Russia amid the diplomatic outreach.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-china-trying-to-recruit-fired-us-federal-employees-cnn-reports/	2025-03-02T03:58:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2201176686.jpg
Kremlin says perceived US foreign policy shift aligns with its 'vision'	The Kremlin has praised what it perceives as the U.S.&apos;s foreign policy shift, claiming on March 2 that it &quot;aligns&quot; with its &quot;vision&quot; after U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s public dispute with President Volodymyr Zelensky. &quot;The new administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations. This largely coincides with our vision,&quot; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in comments published by state-controlled media. &quot;There is a long way to go, because there is huge damage to the whole complex of bilateral relations. But if the political will of the two leaders, President (Vladimir) Putin and President Trump, is maintained, this path can be quite quick and successful.&quot; Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also praised Trump, calling him a &quot;pragmatist&quot; and adding that &quot;that&apos;s what makes him interesting,&quot; state-controlled media reported on March 2. Lavrov claimed that the Trump administration&apos;s so-called common sense approach dictates &quot;stepping aside&quot; from aiding Ukraine. Trump, echoing Kremlin rhetoric on the war in Ukraine, said at the end of February the country should &quot;forget&quot; about joining NATO, which the country sees as a security guarantee against a future Russian invasion. Russia has repeatedly presented NATO expansion as a &quot;justification&quot; for the war. Overlooking the challenges of holding elections in a war zone, Trump on Feb. 19 called Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot;&#x2014;a remark he later claimed he did not remember making. The U.S. also voted alongside Russia on Feb. 24 against a U.N. resolution that condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-comments-on-trump-policy-shift/	2025-03-02T03:33:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1252236776.jpg
Norwegian fuel supplier halts sales to US Navy over Trump-Zelensky dispute, citing 'moral compass'	Norwegian fuel supplier Haltbakk Bunkers will not deliver a &quot;single liter&quot; of fuel to the U.S. Navy until U.S. President Donald Trump &quot;is gone,&quot; the company&apos;s owner told media outlet Kystens Noeringsliv on March 1 after Trump&apos;s highly public dispute with President Volodymyr Zelensky. Zelensky was poised to sign a major natural resources deal with the U.S. on Feb. 28 when a last-minute provocation by U.S. Vice President JD Vance ignited a public clash. Afterward, Zelensky was expelled from the White House, with Trump accusing him of not being &quot;ready&quot; for peace. The official Facebook page of Haltbakk Bunkers, which appears to have since gone private, called the dispute &quot;the biggest sh*tshow ever presented &apos;live on TV&apos; by the current American president and his vice president.&quot; &quot;Huge credit to the president of Ukraine (for) restraining himself and for keeping calm even though the U.S.A. put on a backstabbing TV show. It made us sick,&quot; the post reads, adding that the company decided to no longer act as a fuel provider for U.S. military forces and naval vessels docking in Norway. Haltbakk Bunkers&apos;s owner, Gunnar Gran, told Kystens Noeringsliv that his company provided U.S. warships with 3,000,000 liters of fuel in 2024. Haltbakk Bunkers has &quot;many Ukrainian employees&quot; and wants to show that it maintains support for Ukraine, Gran said. He believes that the boycott &quot;will not upset anyone.&quot; In light of Haltbakk Bunkers&apos;s announced boycott, Norway&apos;s Defense Ministry put out a statement on March 2 reaffirming its ties with the U.S. &quot;The U.S. and Norway maintain a close and strong defense cooperation. American forces will continue to receive the supply and support they require from Norway,&quot; the statement reads. Norway has been supplying Ukraine with military aid in the country&apos;s fight against Russian aggression. Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland announced on Feb. 24 that they would allocate additional humanitarian, military, and energy aid to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/norwegian-fuel-supplier-halts-sales-to-us-over-trump-zelensky-dispute/	2025-03-02T02:42:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2191301206.jpg
UK, France, Ukraine to develop ceasefire plan to present to US	The U.K., France, Ukraine, and possibly other countries will develop a ceasefire plan that will be presented to the U.S., U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in an interview with the BBC on March 2. Starmer is hosting President Volodymyr Zelensky and other leaders in London to discuss how to strengthen support for Ukraine and ensure a just and lasting peace. The summit is even more crucial now after a fallout between the Ukrainian leader and U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House. The British prime minister and French President Emmanuel Macron, who visited Washington earlier this week, are seeking to mend the ties between Kyiv and the U.S. and present a united front on Ukraine and Russia. Speaking to the BBC ahead of the summit, Starmer said the joint ceasefire initiative would be &quot;an important step forward&quot; after the heated exchange in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. &quot;President Zelensky is rightly concerned that if there&apos;s to be a deal, it has to hold. That&apos;s why we&apos;ve talked extensively about what are the guarantees - in what way do we all defend the deal if that deal is made,&quot; Starmer said. The U.K. and France have spearheaded the idea of deploying European peacekeepers in Ukraine to monitor a potential ceasefire. Macron and Starmer appealed to Trump to remain involved in maintaining a post-war order, but they failed to receive any concrete commitments as the new U.S. administration expects Europe to take responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security. The humiliating treatment Zelensky received from Trump and Vice President JD Vance underscored the growing rift between Europe and the U.S. While most European leaders publicly voiced support for Zelensky after the spat, Starmer called both the Ukrainian and U.S. leaders in an attempt to bridge the rift. The prime minister reportedly told Zelensky that fixing relations with Trump would be necessary to ensure lasting peace.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-france-ukraine-to-discuss-ceasefire-plan-to-present-to-us/	2025-03-02T02:28:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202694014.jpg
Macron, Starmer working to pacify Zelensky-Trump relations 'because what is at stake is too important'	U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron are working behind the scenes to pacify relations between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Volodymyr Zelensky following their public spat on Feb. 28. Macron has spoken with both Zelensky and Trump privately, telling La Tribune Dimanche in an interview published on March 1 that he took the initiative to mediate because &quot;what is at stake is too important.&quot; &quot;The manifest destiny of the Americans is to be on the side of the Ukrainians, I have no doubt about it. What the United States has done over the past three years is entirely consistent with its diplomatic and military tradition,&quot; Macron said. &quot;I want to make the Americans understand that disengagement from Ukraine is not in their interest.&quot; Macron also cautioned against signing a peace deal without any security guarantees for Ukraine, adding that &quot;geostrategic deterrence capacity with regard to Russia, China and others, would vanish the same day .&quot; If Russia&apos;s full-scale war of aggression is not stopped in Ukraine, it will &quot;surely go to Moldova&quot; and &quot;perhaps beyond to Romania,&quot; the French president added. Starmer welcomed Zelensky in London on March 1 following Zelensky&#x2019;s contentious visit to Washington. The leaders are set to discuss joint defense and security plans later on March 2 during a summit with other allies. Ahead of the summit, Starmer has cautioned Zelensky to make amends with Trump because &quot;the U.S. has to be involved&quot; in any lasting peace plans for Ukraine, an anonymous source close to the prime minister told the Financial Times on March 1. Both the U.K. and France have supported the idea of deploying peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of the country&apos;s security guarantees. The U.K. is ready &quot;to put boots on the ground, planes in the air to back Ukraine peace deal,&quot; Starmer said at the end of February. Macron, who has spearheaded the idea of deploying European troops on the ground in some capacity since last year, discussed &quot;practical steps&quot; of a possible peacekeeper deployment with Zelensky in January.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-starmer-working-to-pacify-zelensky-trump-relations-because-what-is-at-stake-is-too-important/	2025-03-02T01:55:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2168217153.jpg
Russia pushing disinformation to damage Ukraine's ties with Armenia, Azerbaijan, intel claims	Russia is spreading disinformation that accuses Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) of trying to instigate an armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, HUR said on March 2. The intelligence agency referred to a fake document presented as a report from HUR to Ukraine&apos;s Deputy Defense Minister Ivan Havryliuk, which has been disseminated in Armenian Telegram channels. Armenia and Azerbaijan are bitter rivals who have clashed in several armed conflicts over border and ethnic issues since gaining independence in the 1990s. Moscow has maintained mostly warm ties with Azerbaijan but was also seen as a key military ally of Armenia. Russia&apos;s relationship with Yerevan sharply deteriorated after Russian peacekeepers did not prevent Baku&apos;s lightning offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh in September 2023. The fake report accuses Ukraine&apos;s intelligence of trying to spark a new war to divert Russia&apos;s attention and disperse its forces, alleviating pressure on Ukraine. HUR noted that the document contains several spelling errors and does not meet the requirements of official communication. According to Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence, the fake report aims to &quot;discredit Ukraine and undermine Ukrainian-Armenian and Ukrainian-Azerbaijani relations, which ultimately benefits Russia.&quot; Kyiv has maintained stable relations with both South Caucasus countries. Azerbaijan has provided humanitarian aid during the full-scale war, while Armenia&apos;s pivot away from Moscow signaled the potential strengthening of Ukrainian- Armenian ties.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-spreading-disinformation-to-damage-ukraines-ties-with-armenia-azerbaijan-intelligence-claims/	2025-03-02T01:43:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1233523455.jpg
Putin ally pushing for US, Russia restart of Nord Stream 2, FT reports	Matthias Warnig, a former spy and longtime ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is reportedly lobbying the U.S. to support a potential restart of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, the Financial Times reported on March 2, citing undisclosed sources. Warnig, who led Nord Stream 2&#x2019;s parent company on behalf of Kremlin-controlled gas giant Gazprom until 2023, is reportedly trying to establish contact with U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s team through American businessmen. His efforts come amid discussions on ending Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine and reestablishing economic ties between Washington and Moscow. The Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines in the Baltic Sea were built to supply natural gas from Russia to Europe. The Nord Stream pipelines, fully owned by Russia, were co-financed by five European energy companies. In September 2022, three of the four Nord Stream pipelines were severely damaged in an apparent sabotage attack. Warnig and Nord Stream 2 AG were placed under U.S. sanctions in 2022 by the administration of then-President Joe Biden. Any deal to revive the project would require Washington to lift these sanctions and for Germany to approve the resumption of Russian gas flows to Europe, according to the FT. A U.S. official, speaking anonymously, expressed skepticism over the viability of such an agreement, warning that Berlin&#x2019;s involvement in Nord Stream 2&#x2019;s renewal could &quot;cause huge rifts&quot; with the EU, which maintains sanctions against Russia. Several European officials aware of the backchannel talks &quot;are concerned and have discussed the matter,&quot; the FT added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ft-nord-stream-restart-talks/	2025-03-02T00:53:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/2021-12-thumbnail-image-882jpeg960x0-q90-crop-upscale.jpg
Elon Musk publicly supports call for US to exit NATO, UN	Tech billionaire Elon Musk agreed on March 2 with a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, for the U.S. to exit NATO and the U.N. &quot;I agree,&quot; he wrote in response to a post from a right-wing political commentator saying &quot;it&apos;s time&quot; for the U.S. to leave NATO and the U.N. The news comes after several Republican lawmakers submitted a bill on the U.S. exit from the U.N., claiming that the organization does not align with the Trump administration&apos;s &quot;America First&quot; agenda. I agree https://t.co/ZhjBXCTQfp The U.S. was among several countries, including Russia, Belarus, Israel, and Hungary, that voted against a U.N. resolution at the end of February condemning Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Both NATO and the U.N. were founded by the U.S. and other victors of World War II to promote diplomacy and cooperation between nations as well as to prevent another global war. Musk, an unelected official, currently heads the so-called &#xA0;U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, which has cut significant amounts of government spending, including life-saving foreign aid. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized fellow NATO countries for their perceived lack of contributions to the military alliance and has called for a spending target of 5% of GDP for all members. Kyiv sees NATO membership as a crucial safeguard against future Russian aggression, but Trump said in February that Ukraine &quot;can forget&quot; about joining the alliance, suggesting its bid was a trigger for the war&#x2014;an argument echoed by Russian state propaganda.	https://kyivindependent.com/elon-musk-publicly-supports-call-for-us-to-exit-nato-un/	2025-03-02T00:40:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194418262-1.jpg
Hungary, Slovakia threaten EU unity on Russia, Ukraine ahead of key summit	Leaders of Slovakia and Hungary on March 1 threatened to block EU statements during a key summit next week unless the bloc calls for an immediate ceasefire and launches talks with Russia. European Council President Antonio Costa called a meeting of EU leaders on March 6 to discuss defense spending, further support for Kyiv, and to showcase unity after U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance&apos;s humiliating treatment of President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office earlier this week. Zelensky has also been invited to the EU summit, which will take place after a meeting with international partners in London on March 2 that will exclude Slovak and Hungarian representatives. In a letter to Costa obtained by Reuters, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban reportedly urged the EU to abandon plans for a joint declaration in support of Ukraine and resume direct communication with Moscow like Washington did. &quot;I am convinced that the European Union - following the example of the United States - should enter into direct discussions with Russia on a ceasefire and sustainable peace in Ukraine,&quot; Orban said. The Hungarian prime minister is broadly seen as the most Russian-friendly leader in the EU and a close ideological ally of Trump. Orban was one of the few EU leaders to voice support for the U.S. president rather than Zelensky after their heated exchange in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. &quot;Therefore, I propose not to attempt adopting written conclusions on Ukraine,&quot; Orban wrote, hinting at the fact that the decision must be adopted unanimously. Hungary&apos;s leader has repeatedly obstructed or blocked military support for Ukraine and sanctions against Moscow, leveraging the country&apos;s veto rights. Similarly, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico voiced doubts about Ukraine&apos;s ability to negotiate from a position of strength and said that the EU&apos;s summit statement should include a call for an immediate ceasefire. Issuing the statement after the disastrous White House meeting, Fico also said that Slovakia would not provide financial or military support to Ukraine. Fico halted military aid for Ukraine from Slovak army stocks after taking office in the fall of 2023 but permitted continued arms sales. Slovakia has also provided energy support amid Russian attacks against Ukraine&apos;s power grid. The Slovak populist leader further demanded that the resumption of Russian gas transit to Slovakia &#x2014; a key issue in a conflict between him and Kyiv &#x2014; be included in the summit&apos;s statement. &quot;If the summit does not respect that there are other options besides simply continuing the war, the European Council may not be able to agree on conclusions regarding Ukraine on Thursday,&quot; Fico said. The Slovak leader has previously promoted pro-Russian narratives on Ukraine and the war and met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last December to discuss gas transit issues ahead of Ukraine&apos;s planned transit halt. At the same time, Fico said that Slovakia &quot;respects the need to increase Europe&apos;s defense capabilities&quot; and the decisions of other EU members to continue providing military and financial support for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-slovakia-threaten-eu-unity-on-russia-ukraine-ahead-of-key-summit/	2025-03-02T00:28:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2195100174.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure 20 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least two civilians and injured at least 20, including a child, over the past day, regional authorities reported on March 2. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 63 of the 79 drones Russia launched overnight, the Air Force said. Drones were intercepted over Kharkiv, Poltava, Sumy, Kyiv, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia, Khmelnytskyi, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, and Mykolaiv oblasts. In Donetsk Oblast, two people were killed and seven injured in Russian attacks, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. Ten people, including a child, were also injured in strikes against Kherson Oblast, said the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. A 51-year-old man was injured and subsequently hospitalized after a drone strike in the village of Petropavlivka, according to Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov. Multiple settlements in the region were targeted not only with drones but also with guided aerial bombs. One woman in Khmelnytskyi Oblast was taken to the hospital after suffering an injury in a drone attack and was later discharged, Governor Serhii Tiurin reported. Ten homes were also damaged in the attack. A 31-year-old woman was injured in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, according to Governor Ivan Fedorov. Local authorities recorded damage to at least 18 homes, apartments, and cars. Russian forces carried out over 450 strikes on the partially occupied region over the past day, including not only drone but also artillery strikes. Nineteen Shahed drones were shot down over Sumy Oblast, the local military administration reported. No casualties were given. Since the start of 2025, Russian forces have launched 575 drones at the region, frequently targeting civilian infrastructure, including homes, schools, hospitals, and other vital services.	https://kyivindependent.com/air-force-63-russian-drones-taken-out-by-air-defense-in-overnight-attack/	2025-03-02T00:01:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-02-09_47_18.jpeg
Lithuania invests $21 million in Ukraine's arms industry, agrees to joint production	Lithuania has already invested 20 million euros ($21 million) in purchasing weapons for Kyiv from Ukrainian producers and will produce arms in cooperation with Ukraine, the Lithuanian Defense Ministry said on March 1. Ukraine said it aims to raise over $1 billion in defense support this year under the so-called Danish model, which entails foreign partners purchasing weapons and equipment for Kyiv directly from Ukrainian manufacturers. &quot;The Ukrainian defense industry has incredible potential to become a world-class player due to its high-level expertise, based on direct battlefield experience, the motivation and competence of engineers, and the future-oriented mindset of key industry decision-makers,&quot; Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene said in a statement. Sakaliene&apos;s comments come after she signed a preliminary agreement with Ukraine&apos;s Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin and presidential advisor Alexander Kamyshin on a joint production of strategic weapons directly in Lithuania. &quot;An amount of 20 million euros has already been allocated for this, which will continue to grow. However, we are striving for even closer cooperation - to develop joint Lithuanian and Ukrainian weapons production both in Lithuania and Ukraine,&quot; Sakaliene noted. The statement did not reveal the type of weaponry to be produced under the agreement for security reasons. Lithuania has been among Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022. The Baltic country has provided 910 million euros ($940 million) in military support and pledged to contribute 0.25% of its GDP in defense assistance on an annual basis.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-invests-21-million-in-ukraines-arms-industry-agrees-to-joint-production/	2025-03-01T23:29:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1251797848.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 876,720 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 876,720 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on March 2. This number includes 1,110 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,241 tanks, 21,274 armored fighting vehicles, 39,218 vehicles and fuel tanks, 23,959 artillery systems, 1,306 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,091 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 27,594 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-876-720-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-03-01T23:07:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1247849562-1678210924zoilc.jpg
Russian proxy claims IAEA team arrives at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant via occupied territory	A new team from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine on March 1, marking the first time the agency&apos;s monitors reached the site through the occupied territory. The Moscow-appointed head of the plant said the rotation of inspectors was facilitated by Russian forces and followed extensive talks between the heads of Russia&#x2019;s state nuclear company, Rosatom, and the IAEA. The Kyiv Independent can&apos;t immediately verify these claims. The latest rotation faced delays due to ongoing military activity around the site, with Kyiv and Moscow each accusing the other of violating safety agreements meant to ensure the IAEA&#x2019;s secure passage. The IAEA did not provide immediate comment and Ukrainian officials did not issue a statement on the matter. Russian forces seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest in Europe, during the early weeks of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. While the facility remains under Russian control, it is not currently generating electricity. Since September 2022, the IAEA has maintained a presence at Zaporizhzhia and Ukraine&#x2019;s other nuclear facilities, aiming to monitor risks and ensure nuclear safety. The agency has consistently warned that ongoing hostilities in the area pose serious dangers. Despite its efforts, security concerns around the plant remain unresolved as fighting continues in the region. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi has urged both Ukrainian and Russian forces to exercise restraint and avoid actions that could jeopardize the plant&#x2019;s safety.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-proxy-claims-iaea-team-arrives-at-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-via-occupied-territory/	2025-03-01T21:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/reactor-4.jpeg
US halts cyber operations against Russia, media reports	Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered U.S. Cyber Command to suspend offensive cyber and information operations against Russia, according to a report by the Record. The decision aligns with President Donald Trump&#x2019;s efforts to negotiate an end to Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine under terms that critics argue favor Moscow. Two U.S. officials familiar with the directive told the Washington Post that the pause will remain in effect while diplomatic discussions continue. Cybersecurity experts warn that the move benefits one of America&apos;s most persistent cyber adversaries, potentially weakening U.S. leverage in both cyber and conventional military operations. Trump&#x2019;s broader approach to Russia has raised concerns among U.S. allies. While negotiations with Moscow unfold, European leaders are ramping up their own defense measures to support Ukraine. Meanwhile, intelligence officials emphasize the risks of halting cyber operations against Russia, which remains one of the most active cyber threats to U.S. security. The pause includes operations that typically expose or disrupt Russian malware before it can be deployed against American systems. A former senior defense official told the Record that suspending these efforts, even temporarily, could allow Russian hackers to regroup and strengthen their offensive capabilities. The order from Hegseth contradicts the administration&#x2019;s stated intent to adopt a more aggressive cyber posture against U.S. adversaries. National security adviser Michael Waltz previously suggested a shift toward stronger cyber deterrence, particularly against China and Iran, but omitted Russia from his comments. At a recent United Nations cyber meeting, a State Department official highlighted cyber threats from China but made no mention of Russian-backed ransomware groups, which have targeted critical U.S. infrastructure, including fuel pipelines and hospitals. The absence of Russia from these discussions has raised eyebrows among diplomats and security analysts.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-halts-cyber-operations-against-russia-media-reports/	2025-03-01T20:45:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1790155286.jpg
‘Wrong approach, wrong time, wrong president’ — Waltz reacts to Trump-Zelensky standoff	National Security Advisor Mike Waltz criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, suggesting he is not genuinely seeking an end to the war with Russia. &quot;It&#x2019;s not clear that Zelensky truly wants to stop the fighting,&quot; Waltz said following a tense meeting between the Ukrainian leader and U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Feb. 28. &quot;He came in, even though he was warned not to, determined to litigate all of that &#x2026; This was the wrong approach, wrong time in history, and definitely the wrong president to try to do this.&quot; Their 45-minute Oval Office press briefing escalated into a heated exchange over U.S. aid to Ukraine, ultimately leading to the cancellation of a planned U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement. Trump later took to Truth Social, accusing Zelensky of disrespecting the U.S. and declaring, &quot;He can come back when he is ready for peace.&quot; Zelensky has taken a firm stance on peace and refused to accept what experts have called &quot;capitulatory deal&quot; that could give Russia an advantage. The Ukrainian president asserted during his interview with Fox News that Ukraine is &quot;ready for peace but we need to be in a good position.&quot; &quot;We want peace... that&apos;s why I visited President Trump,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that he hopes that Trump would show stronger support for Ukraine rather than positioning himself as a mediator in the war. He emphasized that Russia was the aggressor, having launched the invasion. &quot;I want really him to be more at our side,&quot; Zelensky said. The meeting, initially intended to formalize a deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, instead highlighted deep divisions over Ukraine policy within Trump&#x2019;s administration. Ukraine-skeptic Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard echoed Trump&#x2019;s stance, with Gabbard claiming that Zelensky has been pushing the U.S. toward &quot;a nuclear war with Russia/WW3 for years now.&quot; Gabbard has previously blamed NATO for Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, and faced scrutiny for her controversial foreign policy views. Ukrainian-born Representative Victoria Spartz also condemned Zelensky&#x2019;s approach, accusing him of prioritizing political theatrics over Ukraine&#x2019;s real needs. &quot;It&#x2019;s such a disservice to the Ukrainian people to play hero and politics&#x2026; after how much was done by us for Ukraine and for Europe,&quot; she said.	https://kyivindependent.com/wrong-approach-wrong-time-wrong-president-waltz-reacts-to-trump-zelensky-standoff/	2025-03-01T18:23:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193394562.jpg
Canada's Trudeau heads to European defense summit in London	Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau departed for London on March 1 to take part in a European defense summit focused on shaping the conditions for a lasting peace in Ukraine. The gathering, initially planned as a high-level European meeting, has gained new urgency with President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s attendance, following his tense exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Feb. 28. Zelensky had traveled to Washington expecting to finalize a critical minerals deal with the U.S., but the agreement fell apart after he pushed for security guarantees alongside economic cooperation. Trump responded with visible frustration, escalating tensions between the two leaders and casting doubt on future American support for Kyiv. The fallout from the meeting has reinforced European concerns about Trump&#x2019;s stance on Ukraine and prompted fresh discussions on strengthening Europe&#x2019;s independent defense efforts. Earlier this month, Trump&#x2019;s overtures toward Russia alarmed European leaders, accelerating their efforts to enhance Ukraine&#x2019;s military support. European governments increasingly view Ukraine&#x2019;s security as integral to their own, and Sunday&#x2019;s summit in London is expected to focus on how to fill the gaps left by uncertain U.S. backing. France, Germany, and the U.K. have been leading discussions on increased defense funding and alternative security arrangements for Kyiv. Canada was not initially listed among the invited participants when U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer outlined plans for the meeting during his recent visit to Washington. Trudeau&#x2019;s decision to attend signals Canada&#x2019;s ongoing commitment to Ukraine and its role in broader transatlantic security discussions. While Ottawa has provided substantial military and financial aid to Kyiv, it remains to be seen what new commitments, if any, Canada will bring to the table.	https://kyivindependent.com/trudeau-heads-to-european-defense-summit-in-london/	2025-03-01T17:18:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2157822397.jpg
Starmer aims to bridge Trump-Zelensky rift as US expects apology, Bloomberg reports	U.K.&apos;s Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to deliver a stark message to European leaders, urging them to confront the &quot;brutal reality&quot; of growing security threats and commit to higher defense spending. At a high-stakes security summit in London on March 2, he will push allies to take concrete steps to support Ukraine, emphasizing that diplomatic statements alone will not persuade Washington to maintain its security guarantees. The meeting which will be attended by leaders from France, Italy, Canada, Germany, and Turkey, has gained urgency following U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s clash with President Volodymyr Zelensky, which raised concerns about future American support for Kyiv. Amid the diplomatic fallout, the Trump administration has privately signaled that it expects a public apology from Zelensky to mend relations, European officials told Bloomberg. In a bid to stabilize the transatlantic alliance, Starmer has taken on a central diplomatic role, leveraging his recent White House meeting to keep communication open between Trump and European leaders. Following Zelensky&#x2019;s tense encounter with Trump, British officials have worked behind the scenes to prevent the situation from spiraling further. Starmer personally reached out to both Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron to encourage renewed dialogue, positioning the U.K. as a key intermediary between Washington and European capitals. In the meantime, some NATO leaders, including Secretary General Mark Rutte, have encouraged Zelensky to rebuild ties with Trump, recognizing the U.S. remains Ukraine&#x2019;s most important military backer. Starmer and Macron are also pushing for a European-led security initiative, including a potential peacekeeping force, to safeguard any future ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia. While Trump has so far refused to back such efforts, Starmer will argue that a stronger European defense posture could help secure American support. He believes that demonstrating Europe&#x2019;s ability to shoulder more responsibility may prevent Trump from fully disengaging from Ukraine. The challenge, however, is convincing other European nations to step up their own defense contributions and commit to long-term military assistance. With the London summit now a critical test for European unity, Starmer is working to prevent Trump from sidelining European leaders in any potential negotiations with Russia. His strategy hinges on ensuring that Ukraine remains central to peace talks while securing commitments from European allies to sustain military and financial aid.	https://kyivindependent.com/starmer-aims-to-bridge-trump-zelensky-rift-as-us-expects-apology-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-01T14:47:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200011633.jpg
Italy to provide Ukraine with $13 million to restore energy infrastructure	Rome signed an agreement with Kyiv on Feb. 28 to provide Ukraine with 13 million euros ($13.5 million) directed towards the country&apos;s Energy Support Fund, Ukraine&apos;s Energy Ministry announced. The funding will be used to support &quot;the restoration of Ukraine&#x2019;s energy sector,&quot; a news release from the Energy Ministry read. Russia continues to target Ukrainian energy infrastructure, testing Ukraine&apos;s resolve as the country is enduring another winter. &quot;This assistance will allow us to procure essential equipment and strengthen the resilience of Ukraine&#x2019;s energy system at a time when the enemy is relentlessly attacking energy facilities,&quot; Ukraine&#x2019;s Deputy Energy Minister Roman Andarak said in a statement. Earlier this month, Italy signed an agreement with the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) to launch a 2 million euro ($2.07 million) project to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s energy system, the Italian Embassy in Ukraine told the Kyiv Independent. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who took office in late 2022, has consistently supported Kyiv and pledged unwavering assistance until the war ends. Material losses from Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure have amounted to &quot;billions of dollars,&quot; according to Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko. Halushchenko said on Feb. 24 that Russia has launched more than 30 mass strikes on Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure over the three years of its full-scale invasion. Over the past three years, Russian troops have occupied territories hosting energy facilities producing 18 gigawatts (GW) of generation. The occupied facilities include hydroelectric power plants, thermal power plants, and Europe&apos;s largest nuclear power plant, stationed in Zaporizhzhia Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/italy-to-provide-13-million-toward-restoring-ukraines-energy-infrastructure/	2025-03-01T13:31:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/10_1_2.jpeg
UK to provide $2.8 billion loan to Ukraine backed by frozen Russian assets	The United Kingdom signed an agreement with Kyiv on March 1 to provide Ukraine with a loan worth 2.26 billion pounds ($2.84 billion) backed by frozen Russian assets. The loan, which is part of the Group of Seven&apos;s (G7) Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) credit initiative, was signed amid President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s visit to London to meet with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer. &quot;The United Kingdom continues to stand in defense of Ukraine. Today&apos;s agreement, which contributes to strengthening Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities, confirms this,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko said in a statement. The loan will go towards &quot;purchasing defense equipment according to Ukraine&apos;s needs,&quot; the Finance Ministry said. In October 2024, G7 countries came to an agreement that pledged to provide Ukraine with almost $50 billion loan. The United States will contribute the bulk of the loan with $20 billion in assistance. The U.S. is closely followed by European Union countries, including France, Germany, and Italy, with a combined $19.4 billion. The remaining approximately $10 billion will be divvied up with Canada providing $3.7 billion, Japan providing $3.07 billion, and the U.K. providing $2.8 billion in loan funding. Under the G7 ERA initiative, Ukraine had previously received $1 billion from the U.S. and $3.1 billion from the EU. While Western countries have frozen $300 billion in Russian assets, they can only access the annual income generated by these funds, approximately $3.2 billion. These profits will back the $50-billion loan to Kyiv, while the vast majority of the assets are frozen in European countries. In January, Zelensky and Starmer signed a 100-year partnership agreement during their meeting in Kyiv on Jan. 16. The wide-ranging deal encompasses cooperation in military, energy, scientific, cultural, economic, and other sectors. The loan&apos;s announcement and Zelensky&apos;s visit to London comes amid the fallout of a heated exchange in the White House on Feb. 28 between Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump. Earlier in the day, Starmer, in line with European allies, reaffirmed his country&apos;s support for Ukraine and Zelensky. &quot;We stand with Ukraine for as long as it may take,&quot; Starmer told reporters at a press briefing alongside Zelensky, adding that Ukraine has &quot;full backing across the United Kingdom.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-provides-2-8-billion-loan-to-ukraine-backed-by-frozen-russian-assets/	2025-03-01T12:34:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/gettyimages-2202072150-612x612.jpg
Russian missile attack on Odesa damages civilian foreign vessel, casualties reported	A Russian ballistic missile struck the Odesa port on the evening of March 1, damaging port infrastructure as well as a foreign civilian ship flying the flag of Panama, Odesa Oblast Governor Oleh Kiper reported. Two port employees were injured as a results of the attack. No information was available as to the extent of their injuries. The Swiss-owned container ship MSC LEVANTE F sailed into the port earlier in the day, local Odesa publication Dumska reported. No information was immediately available as to what the vessel was carrying, or the extent of the damage. Foreign vessels have previously been damaged in Russian attacks on the port. In October 2024, multiple ships had been damaged in separate attacks on the Odesa port. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 23 at the International Conference on Food Security in Kyiv that Russia has damaged 321 port infrastructure facilities, as well as 20 foreign merchant vessels since July 2023. Traveling along the Black Sea route, ships are regularly at risk of being attacked by Russia. Since the beginning of the all-out war, mines have also been drifting along the trade route, which also poses a risk to maritime transport. As a major grain producer, Ukraine exports about 6 million tons of grain per month through ports along the Black Sea. Following an initial blockade at the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Russia unilaterally terminated the Black Sea grain deal last year forcing Kyiv to set up a new export route in the Black Sea. Initially envisioned as a humanitarian corridor to allow the departure of ships stranded there since the start of the full-scale war, it has since grown into a full-blown trade route.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-on-odesa-damages-civilian-foreign-vessel-casualties-reported/	2025-03-01T11:59:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158388860.jpg
Ukrainians, foreigners raised Hr 27 million 'for nukes' hours after Zelensky-Trump White House clash	Ukrainians and foreign donors have sent over 27 million hryvnia ($649,000) in donations to the fundraiser &quot;for nukes&quot; that was opened immediately after the publicized White House clash between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. The &quot;for nukes&quot; reference serves as a joke that refers to President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s previous assertions that if Western allies are not ready to accept the country into NATO, then the U.S. should provide Ukraine with an alternative security guarantee, such as nuclear weapons. With many Ukrainians staying up late due to the news about Trump and Zelensky&apos;s heated meeting in Washington, the fundraiser was opened at 1 a.m. Kyiv time by Oleg Gorokhovskyi, Ukrainian businessman and co-owner of country&apos;s largest online bank Monobank. Zelensky left Washington early on Feb. 28 without signing a mineral deal with the United States after Trump reportedly ordered his officials to tell the Ukrainian delegation to leave the White House, despite protest from the Ukrainians. &quot;There are many requests to start fundraising for the nukes. Here is the jar,&quot; Gorokhovskyi wrote in his social media, without elaborating on the subsequent use of the &quot;nukes.&quot; He added a link to the &apos;jar,&apos; Monobank&apos;s famous feature that many volunteers use to raise money for the war effort and humanitarian aid, such as reconstruction of the Ukraine&apos;s largest children hospital Okhmatdyt after Russian missile attack in 2024. According to Gorokhovskyi, Hr 2 million (nearly $50.000) were raised in the first 30 minutes of the fundraiser. Sixteen hours after it began, the sum reached Hr 22 million. It was not immediately clear as to what chartiable cause the money will be donated to. &quot;About 70,000 participants from 61 countries,&quot; Gorokhovskyi wrote on Mar. 1. &quot;After Ukraine, the U.S. donates the most, followed by Poland. Thank you, friends! Americans and Poles are our closest friends and allies beyond any doubt,&quot; he added. The fundraiser&apos;s success shows a wave of support for Zelensky from Ukrainians and foreigners following his explosive meeting with Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance. Following the exchange, a number of European leaders on Feb. 28 reaffirmed their support for Ukraine and Zelensky. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas emphasized the EU&apos;s commitment to stepping up assistance to Ukraine, enabling the country to continue resisting the aggressor. &quot;Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It&apos;s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge,&quot; Kallas posted on X. Ukraine&apos;s abandoned its arsenal of nuclear weapons with the signing of the Budapest Memorandum 30 years ago in exchange for security guarantees from both Russia an the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-raised-hr-22-mln-for-nukes-in-hours-after-the-white-house-clash/	2025-03-01T11:18:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1659540772.jpg

Zelensky meets with Starmer in London following Oval Office clash with Trump	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky met with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer on March 1 one day after Zelensky&apos;s heated exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House. Zelensky did not respond to shouted questions on Trump as he was greeted by Starmer at 10 Downing Street. Zelensky left Washington early without signing a mineral deal with the United States following a tense argument in front of journalists between the two leaders. Trump later reportedly ordered his officials to tell the Ukrainian delegation to leave the White House, despite protest from the Ukrainians. &quot;He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for peace,&quot; Trump posted on TruthSocial. Zelensky confirmed that he will travel to London after his visit to the United States during a press conference on Feb. 26. He&apos;s set to take part in a summit with European leaders hosted by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer to discuss joint defense and security plans on Sunday. Following the exchange, a number of European leaders on Feb. 28 reaffirmed their support for Ukraine and Zelensky.

NATO Secretary General calls for Zelensky to 'restore relationship' with Trump following Oval Office clash	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte called on March 1 for President Volodymyr Zelensky to mend relations with U.S. President Donald Trump following a tense exchange in White House a day prior. Zelensky left Washington early without signing a mineral deal with the United States following a tense argument in front of journalists between the two leaders. Trump later reportedly ordered his officials to tell the Ukrainian delegation to leave the White House, despite protest from the Ukrainians. Speaking to the BBC, Rutte said that it was &quot;important that President Zelensky finds a way to restore his relationship with the American president and with the senior American leadership team.&quot; Rutte, who said he has spoken to Zelensky twice since the incident, called the public argument &quot;unfortunate.&quot; The secretary general added that &quot;we really have to give Trump credit,&quot; for providing weapons to Ukraine during Trump&apos;s first term in office, adding that that U.S. commands &quot;respect&quot; for their support. Rutte&apos;s comments come as a number of European leaders on Feb. 28 reaffirmed their support for Ukraine and Zelensky. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas emphasized the EU&apos;s commitment to stepping up assistance to Ukraine, enabling the country to continue resisting the aggressor. &quot;Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader.

Following the tense exchange, Zelensky appeared on Fox News to attempt to mend any fractured relations that may have emerged with Trump. &quot;We are very close partners,&quot; Zelensky told Fox News. &quot;I think this kind of spat is not good for both sides.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s president told Fox News&apos; Bret Baier that he doesn&#x2019;t feel he needs to apologize to Trump after a heated exchange at the White House. &quot;No, I respect president, and I respect American people, and I think that we have to be very open and very honest and I&#x2019;m not sure that we did something bad,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;I think some things we have to discuss out of media with all respect to democracy and free media.&quot; U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio later called for Zelensky to apologize for how the meeting unfolded, questioning whether the Ukrainian leader was truly committed to peace. When asked if Zelensky though the relationship could be salvaged following the tense exchange, Zelensky replied: &quot;Yes, of course, because it&apos;s more than to the president. It&apos;s a historical relations between our people.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-secretary-general-calls-for-zelensky-to-restore-relationship-with-trump-following-oval-office-clash/	2025-03-01T09:25:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187484276.jpg
Letter to the editor: The Oval Office fiasco was a calculated setup to humiliate Ukraine and undermine democracy	The recent Oval Office meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wasn&#x2019;t just a diplomatic disaster &#x2014; it was a setup. From the moment Zelensky walked into that room, the stage had already been set. This wasn&#x2019;t about serious discussions on aid or strategy. It was about weakening Ukraine, pressuring its leader, and crafting a narrative that justifies pulling back U.S. support. Trump&#x2019;s accusation that Zelensky was &#x201C;gambling with World War III&#x201D; and Vice President J.D. Vance&#x2019;s rebuke for supposed &#x201C;ingratitude&#x201D; weren&#x2019;t off-the-cuff remarks. They were planned. Carefully constructed talking points designed to turn Zelensky from an ally into a liability in the eyes of the American public. And the goal? To shift blame away from Russia, excuse future inaction, and force Ukraine into a losing position &#x2014; all while making it look like Zelensky&#x2019;s fault. Let&#x2019;s be clear: Zelensky didn&#x2019;t walk into a discussion. He walked into a trap. Rather than focusing on ways to strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s defenses, Trump and Vance ambushed him &#x2014; portraying Ukraine as a dependent nation that demands too much and gives too little. It was an act of public humiliation, not diplomacy. By demanding that Zelensky negotiate with Vladimir Putin &#x2014; a man who has lied, invaded, and slaughtered without hesitation &#x2014; Trump isn&#x2019;t pushing for peace. He&#x2019;s pushing for Ukrainian surrender. No serious strategist believes that handing over territory will stop Russia&#x2019;s war. History has shown us that appeasement doesn&#x2019;t work. If Ukraine concedes today, Putin will push further tomorrow. The Baltics, Poland, other NATO allies &#x2014; they&#x2019;re all watching. Beyond the Oval Office theatrics, there was something even more disturbing: the so-called minerals deal. According to leaked reports, Trump&#x2019;s team floated the idea that the U.S. should gain control over Ukraine&#x2019;s critical natural resources in exchange for continued military aid. Think about that for a moment. The deal wasn&#x2019;t just about weakening Ukraine politically &#x2014; it was about exploiting it economically. When the U.S. helped Britain during World War II, did we demand control over its coal and steel industries? When NATO defended West Germany during the Cold War, did we insist on taking its most valuable resources? No. Because allies don&#x2019;t extort each other. The only person who really benefits from this? Vladimir Putin. Trump&#x2019;s performance in the Oval Office played right into Kremlin propaganda &#x2014; painting Ukraine as desperate, Zelensky as ungrateful, and U.S. support as a burden for America. This kind of messaging isn&#x2019;t just harmful &#x2014; it&#x2019;s dangerous. It sends a clear signal to Putin: America&#x2019;s commitment to Ukraine is weakening. If Putin believes that, he&#x2019;ll double down. More aggression, more escalation, more war. And it won&#x2019;t stop with Ukraine. If America turns its back now, Taiwan, South Korea, and NATO allies will wonder &#x2014; are they next? This wasn&#x2019;t just an attack on Zelensky. It was an attack on American credibility. Some argue that the U.S. has already done enough for Ukraine. That billions in military aid and weapons should be enough. That the American people are tired of endless commitments abroad. That&#x2019;s a fair concern. But let&#x2019;s be honest: This isn&#x2019;t just about Ukraine. It&#x2019;s about whether the free world still stands against tyranny, or if we&#x2019;re willing to let dictators redraw borders at will. President Zelensky did not cave. He did not concede. He did not betray his country. The question now is: Will America do the same?

Russian forces suffer record vehicle losses in February	During the month of February, Ukrainian forces destroyed the largest number of Russian vehicles since the start of the full-scale invasion, according to Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry. In the shortest month of the year, Ukrainians destroyed 3,472 vehicles and fuel tanks, as well as 596 armoured combat vehicles and 331 tanks, the statement said. In February, the number of combat clashes dropped compared to January: 3,274 against 5,087. Instead, the number of enemy air strikes on the Ukrainian troops&apos; positions and frontline settlements increased from about 2,400 guided aerial bombs in January to 3,522 in February. The Ministry also sited the General Staff&apos;s information on Russia&apos;s manpower losses, which shows that the Russian army irretrievably lost 36,570 people in February. Russia has marginally gained ground in eastern Ukraine and Kursk Oblast in recent months but at the cost of heavy casualties as well as equipment losses. As military equipment dwindles, Russian commanders have been forced to provide less protective equipment to soldiers, highlighted by their use of civilian cars in attacks. The General Staff reported on March 1 that Russia has lost 875,610 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022 &#x2014; an estimate in line with Western intelligence assessments.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-lost-most-vehicles-since-beginning-of-all-out-war-in-past-month/	2025-03-01T08:22:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1749127943.jpg
Trump can go to hell' — We asked 7 Ukrainian soldiers about Zelensky's Oval Office argument	An astounding political encounter played out in front of the world on Feb. 28, as a highly-anticipated meeting between Presidents Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump descended into a verbal brawl, the cancelling of a mineral deal and &#x2014; reportedly &#x2014; Zelensky&apos;s unceremonious eviction from the White House. Zelensky left Washington without holding a joint news conference scheduled for later in the day, after Trump, U.S. Vice President JD Vance, and a reporter berated him over not being &quot;thankful&quot; for American aid and his decision not to wear a suit for the meeting. &quot;He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for peace,&quot; Trump posted on Truth Social. The confrontation prompted an outpouring of support for Zelensky, particularly from European leaders, with EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas saying that Trump&apos;s behavior showed &quot;the free world needs a new leader.&quot; As the drama played out on the world stage, on the front lines in Ukraine, the country&apos;s soldiers continued to fend off Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. When the Kyiv Independent reached out to soldiers, several said they couldn&#x2019;t respond properly due to Russian shelling and strikes that occurred in the hours following the tumultuous meeting. One sent a photo of a Russian kamikaze drone strike on their position near the front lines. I don&apos;t know much about politics. However, I have enough knowledge to understand what Trump and his team are trying to say with this behavior. Now in the United States, President Zelensky is portrayed as a warmonger. It&apos;s as if Ukraine started this war, as if we are fighting because there is nothing else for us to do, as if we don&apos;t want peace... But in fact, everyone knows that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin started the war, it is Russian troops who attack Ukrainian cities every day, and not the other way around. Ukrainians want peace, because it is in our country that war is going on, our people are dying. We are grateful to the people of the United States and other countries for their support, and we are ready to share our resources for the sake of peace, but we must have some serious guarantees that Putin will not attack again. Once upon a time, we took our allies at their word and gave up nuclear weapons &#x2014; and what did it lead to? In my opinion, President Zelensky behaved with dignity, despite all the circumstances of this meeting. I support him, although I understand that the United State&apos;s refusal to help will lead to a serious deterioration in the situation on the front. But I sincerely hope this will not happen and that the United States will remain an ally of Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meet in the Oval Office at the White House on Friday, Feb 28 (Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images)Bart, special forces sniper Pokrovsk direction I am in f**king shock. Me and all my guys support Zelensky, I would do the same if I were him, I am very disappointed in Trump and the United States. I can&apos;t even find the words to express my disappointment, let him openly express his support for Putin and impose some sanctions on us or whatever he wants. F**k him, and JD Vance and (Elon) Musk. And in my opinion, (Russian forces in Pokrovsk area) are running out of steam, because they keep getting their asses kicked here. A strong geopolitical decision (from Zelensky). Despite the war and other troubles that are brewing in our country, we have saved face in front of a foreign superpower and the whole world. Ukrainians must behave with dignity and not forget that in reality, only the strong are respected. Everything is very, very crazy and just keeps getting crazier. It was very strange &#x2014; I don&apos;t remember ever seeing something like this before when diplomats or presidents have met. I&apos;ve never seen it in Russia, never in Ukraine, and never in the history of the United States. It looked not like presidents talking, but just guys on the street. Zelensky showed too much emotion. If you&apos;re speaking in this situation with people who have helped you with weapons and money, then you must be cooler with them &#x2014; but what he said was true. Maybe President Trump doesn&apos;t understand, but we are very thankful to the American people, and to Great Britain, France, Poland, everyone who has helped us. But if the whole world stopped supporting us tomorrow, we won&apos;t stop our struggle &#x2014; we&apos;ll still try to save our families, our children, our wives, our houses, our country, our independence, and our nation. Help us save our independence, democracy, and stop Russian aggression. Putin is the new Adolf Hitler of the 21st century. Trump is right that a Third World War is very close now. And if we don&apos;t stop Putin in Ukraine, a Third World War will be a certainty. Trump is a pragmatist. He has no empathy, doesn&#x2019;t understand what&#x2019;s happening, and doesn&#x2019;t even want to. To him, both sides &#x2014; us and Russia &#x2014; are morally equal in their actions. He reduces everything to money, but I can&#x2019;t help but recall the saying that true strength lies not in money, but in truth. And the truth is on our side. Trump, as a businessman, is simply suggesting trading our regions for peace. That&#x2019;s quite a concept. Imagine if France had told the thirteen colonies to give up part of their territories to the British for the sake of peace because they had weak bargaining power. It looks like an old dictator helping his old friend get what he wants. I think in a few days, emotions will settle, and they&#x2019;ll try to spin this differently. But just imagine Franklin Roosevelt negotiating with Hitler. I believe Trump is America&#x2019;s shame &#x2014; a country that always declares its commitment to freedom. A country that itself became a nation through a struggle against imperialism. Honestly, Trump can go to hell. Better to stand alone than with allies like these, who help you and then exploit it. You fight for survival, and they barter aid for resources. My opinion is that those &#x201C;negotiations&#x201D; are just information noise and hype for the media, not really worth paying attention to. And the important thing is that all people of the democratic world will pay dearly for their infantility, not wanting to get out of the warm bath of a comfortable life and take responsibility for their countries. Ukrainians are already paying dearly. The same will happen to Europe and the United States. By electing irresponsible populists who promise to solve all our problems in a day, we are simply postponing and deepening them. But these are politicians, they are eager for power and got what they want. Voters are responsible for everything, after all, both presidents were elected in legal elections. We still have many such adventures ahead of us. But we must fight, regardless of the ignoramuses in power. I don&#x2019;t understand how Zelensky held back from slapping him.

Israel wants US to keep Syria 'weak' by allowing Russian bases, sources tell Reuters	Israel works to counter Turkey&apos;s growing influence in Syria by lobbying the United States to keep it weak and decentralised, including by letting Russia keep its military bases in the country, Reuters reported on Feb. 28. Israeli officials have told Washington that Syria&apos;s new Islamist rulers who ousted pro-Russian Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad will pose a threat to Israel&apos;s borders if backed by Turkey, Reuters wrote, citing four sources familiar with the communications. To contain Turkey, Israeli officials tried to persuade U.S. officials that Russia should keep its Mediterranean naval base in Syria&apos;s Tartus province and its Khmeimim air base in Latakia province, which surprised some U.S. officials, according to the report. Syria&apos;s new leadership is in talks with Russia over the fate of the military bases. Some experts say that the new U.S. President Donald Trump could be more open to Russia staying in Syria than his predecessor, Joe Biden. According to the report, Biden&apos;s administration considered offering to ease the sanctions on Syria in exchange for closing Russia&apos;s two military bases Aron Lund, a fellow at U.S.-based think-tank Century International, told Reuters that Israel had a good chance of influencing U.S. thinking, describing the new administration as wildly pro-Israeli. &quot;Syria is barely even on Trump&apos;s radar now. It&apos;s low priority, and there&apos;s a policy void to fill,&quot; he said. Since dictator al-Assad was ousted to Russia in December, Russia began withdrawing assets from Syria, raising doubts about the future of its military presence in the country. Many assets still remain in Syria. However, Russian delegation had since traveled to Syria to reportedly meet the new leadership, and Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin pledged support and cooperation to Syria&#x2019;s new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa. Recent reports suggested that Russia might be close to a deal with Syria to maintain a limited military presence, in exchange for assisting Damascus in its fight with the Islamic State, which remains active in eastern Syria, according to Bloomberg. Ukraine has also reached out to Syria&apos;s new government regarding Russia&apos;s military presence. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha visited Damascus on Dec. 30 and later indicated that Kyiv and Damascus share similar views on the matter.	https://kyivindependent.com/israel-wants-us-to-keep-syria-weak-by-allowing-russian-bases-sources-tell-reuters/	2025-03-01T07:14:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1178072715.jpg
Bernie Sanders on Trump’s alignment with Russia	U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders sat down with the Kyiv Independent on Feb. 27 to share his concerns about Trump&#x2019;s growing alignment with Russia and other authoritarian regimes, what a possible U.S.-Russia alliance would mean for the American people, the role of billionaires like Elon Musk in shaping both domestic and international political discourse, and why defending Ukraine is crucial for the future of global democracy.	https://kyivindependent.com/bernie-sanders-on-trumps-alignment-with-russia/	2025-03-01T06:35:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_9175.jpg
World stars show support for Ukraine after the White House clash	Several American and European actors and writers published words of support for Ukraine on their social media after the U.S. President Donald Trump clashed in a heated argument with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House. Pedro Pascal, American actor starring in &quot;Narcos,&quot; &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; and &quot;The Last of Us&quot; posted several Instagram stories in support of Ukraine and Zelensky. &quot;Courage has a name,&quot; he wrote in a post featuring the map of Ukraine, also sharing supportive posts from actresses Elizabeth Banks and Piper Perabo, as well as Zelensky&apos;s portraits. &quot;Stay on the right side of history,&quot; he added. Actress Elizabeth Banks posted a Ukrainian flag alongside a statement: &quot;I support Ukraine.&quot; American actor Misha Collins, an ambassador of United24 initiative founded by Zelensky, wrote on X that he&apos;s thankful to the Ukrainian president and all of Ukraine for &quot;standing up to the bullies.&quot; &quot;What I saw was two pompous, traitorous cowards trying to force a courageous leader to kiss their rings. So embarrassed for my country,&quot; Collins wrote. Catherine Deneuve, a veteran French actress, opened the 50th C&#xE9;sar Film Awards ceremony on the stage in Paris with a Ukrainian flag pin on her chest, dedicating the ceremony to Ukraine. She has expressed her support on multiple occasions since 2023. American historian and writer Timothy Snyder also wrote on X to back up Zelensky after the White House clash, critisizing Trump and Vance&apos;s actions. &quot;Trump and Vance act as if the problem is that Ukraine is resisting an ongoing Russian invasion. The problem is the ongoing Russian invasion. If they want to use American power to stop the war, apply it to the aggressor. Abusing the victim is not going to end a war of aggression,&quot; he wrote. Actress Alyssa Milano, who became a United24 ambassador in 2024, wrote a post on Instagram to tell Ukrainians that she &quot;sees them and fees their pain.&quot; &quot;I beg all compassionate public figures, billionaires, elected officials, all the leaders and people of the world who believe in democracy&#x2014; help us overcome this madness. The fight against this regime and against fascism depends on you all.&quot; Milano wrote. Actor Ben Stiller and writer Joan Rowling also publicly supported Ukraine in their social media. After the clash, many European leaders expressed their support of Ukraine and Zelensky, while several pro-Russian European politicians openly supported Trump.	https://kyivindependent.com/world-stars-show-support-for-ukraine-after-the-white-house-clash/	2025-03-01T06:29:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/13220d209a32c2e16c526150d0b5ef4f_1655744746.jpeg
Pro-Russian European politicians openly support Trump after clash with Zelensky	Several European politicians that are considered pro-Russian expressed their approval for the U.S. President Donald Trump after he clashed in a heated argument with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban thanked Trump in his post on X. &quot;Today President Trump stood bravely for peace. Even if it was difficult for many to digest,&quot; Orban said. Orban, widely seen as the EU&apos;s most pro-Russian leader, has consistently opposed military aid for Ukraine and maintained close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze wished Trump &quot;endurance and courage in this difficult struggle&quot; on Facebook on March 1. &quot;President Trump and his peace efforts were condemned one after another by the people responsible for unleashing a bloody war and the cold-blooded killing of Ukraine and thousands of Ukrainians,&quot; his statement said. Kobakhidze sparked a political crisis by announcing the suspension of Georgia&apos;s EU accession process until at least 2028 after the elections last October. Protests erupted in Tbilisi against the ruling Georgian Dream party, accused of democratic backsliding and dragging Georgia into the Kremlin&apos;s orbit. Tino Chrupalla, one of the leaders of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, said on X that peace in Ukraine should be achieved even without Zelensky&apos;s participation. &quot;President Trump is cancelling talks with President Zelensky because he is not ready for peace. Peace must still be achieved, even without the beggarly President Zelensky,&quot; Chrupalla wrote. &quot;Since the EU and Germany cannot act as mediators, the US and Russia must come to an agreement,&quot; he added Earlier, AfD showed support for Russian politics and has been mired in scandal after reports of its affiliations with neo-Nazi groups. The statements come as many democratic European leaders expressed their support for Zelensky, who has reportedly landed in London for a summit of European leaders on March 2.	https://kyivindependent.com/pro-russian-european-politicians-support-trump-after-clash-with-zelensky/	2025-03-01T04:13:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1333428293.jpg

The plane is due to land at London&apos;s Stansted Airport at 11 a.m. local time. Zelensky confirmed that he will travel to London after his visit to the United States during a press conference on Feb. 26. He&apos;s set to take part in a summit with European leaders hosted by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer to discuss joint defense and security plans on Sunday. A statement from Starmer on Friday night confirmed that he had spoken with the U.S. and Ukrainian presidents after their clash in the White House, BBC reported. According to the report, Starmer retains &quot;unwavering support for Ukraine.&quot; President Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s press briefing in the Oval Office on Feb. 28 ended in a heated argument about American aid to Ukraine, followed by the canceling of the planned signing of the U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement. A number of European leaders on Feb. 28 reaffirmed their support for Ukraine and President &#xA0;Zelensky, including Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, French President Emmanuel Macron, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other leaders.	https://kyivindependent.com/president-zelenskys-plane-left-the-us-to-london/	2025-03-01T01:54:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193577260.jpg

He should apologize' — Rubio slams Zelensky after tense White House meeting	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky after his Oval Office meeting with President Donald Trump turned into what Rubio described as a &quot;fiasco.&quot; In an interview with CNN, Rubio said Zelensky should apologize for how the meeting unfolded, questioning whether the Ukrainian leader was truly committed to peace. &quot;There was no need for him to go in there and become antagonistic,&quot; Rubio said, arguing that Zelensky&#x2019;s approach made negotiations more difficult. The meeting, originally intended to discuss U.S. support for Ukraine and potential pathways to peace, quickly fell apart. Trump and Vice President JD Vance accused Zelensky of overestimating his leverage and failing to show enough appreciation for past U.S. aid. Rubio suggested that Zelensky&#x2019;s combative stance raised doubts about his willingness to negotiate: &quot;Maybe Zelensky doesn&#x2019;t want a peace deal. He says he does, but maybe he doesn&#x2019;t.&quot; The fallout from the meeting cast serious uncertainty over the future of U.S. assistance to Ukraine. Zelensky asserted during his interview with Fox News that Ukraine is &quot;ready for peace but we need to be in a good position.&quot; &quot;We want peace... that&apos;s why I visited President Trump,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that he hopes that Trump would show stronger support for Ukraine rather than positioning himself as a mediator in the war. He emphasized that Russia was the aggressor, having launched the invasion. &quot;I want really him to be more at our side,&quot; Zelensky said. The tension escalated further when Trump abruptly ended the discussion, ordered Zelensky to leave the White House, and canceled a scheduled joint press conference. The incident came at a time when European leaders, including those from the U.K. and France, were pressing Washington to take a more active role in negotiations. Rubio, however, defended Trump&#x2019;s approach, saying the president had made it clear that Zelensky would be welcome back when he was &quot;ready to make peace and he&#x2019;s serious about peace.&quot; Rubio insisted that Trump is the only world leader capable of ending the war: &quot;Tonight, people will die in Ukraine&#x2026; This is an unsustainable, bloody war that has to come to an end. And right now, the only leader in the world that can even have a chance of bringing about an end to this is named President Donald Trump.&quot; He added that achieving a peace agreement would be complex but argued that Zelensky needed to engage more constructively rather than resist diplomatic efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/he-should-apologize-rubio-slams-zelenskya-after-tense-white-house-meeting/	2025-02-28T18:40:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194552772.jpg
We're looking for peace, we're not looking to go into a 10-year-war,' Trump says	President Donald Trump on Feb. 28 called for an &quot;immediate ceasefire&quot; between Russia and Ukraine, warning President Volodymyr Zelensky that he must pursue peace or risk losing American support. Trump has taken a confrontational stance towards Ukraine, criticizing Zelensky for being &quot;disrespectful&quot; and accusing him of gambling with World War III. Trump has pushed for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, suggesting that Ukraine should make concessions and that he could negotiate an agreement giving Ukraine &quot;almost all of the land.&quot; In a recent heated Oval Office meeting, Trump delivered an ultimatum to Zelensky, adding that &quot;You&apos;re either going to make a deal or we&apos;re out,&quot; and later declared that Zelensky was not ready for peace if America is involved. Shortly after, the U.S. abruptly canceled the signing of a minerals deal with Ukraine. Zelensky&#x2019;s visit followed weeks of intense negotiations, as Ukraine pushed back against the first two draft proposals for a mineral deal, arguing they placed one-sided obligations on Kyiv without offering any security guarantees from Washington. The proposed agreement, which had been under discussion for some time, aimed to create a fund where Ukraine would allocate half of the revenue from the future commercialization of its state-owned mineral resources&#x2014;including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. &quot;We want peace,&quot; Trump told reporters following the meeting which, he said, &quot;didn&apos;t work exactly great.&quot; &quot;He (Zelensky) overplayed his hand (...) we are not looking to go into a 10-year-war and play games, we want peace. He&apos;s going to have to make peace. He&apos;s got to stop the fighting, he&apos;s got to stop the death,&quot; Trump said, adding that Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin &quot;wants to end it.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/were-looking-for-peace-were-not-looking-to-go-into-a-10-year-war-trump-says/	2025-02-28T17:59:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158937171.jpg
This kind of spat is not good for both sides,' Zelensky says following Oval Office clash with Trump	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. In an interview with Fox News on Feb. 28, President Volodymyr Zelensky attempted to mend any fractured relations that may have emerged following a heated exchange in the White House between himself and U.S. President Donald Trump earlier in the day. The 45-minute press briefing, which turned into a shouting match between the two leaders, ended with the canceling of the planned signing of the U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement. &quot;He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for peace,&quot; Trump posted on Truth Social. Trump later ordered his officials to tell the Ukrainian officials to leave the White House, despite protest from the Ukrainian delegation. &quot;We are very close partners,&quot; Zelensky told Fox News. &quot;I think this kind of spat is not good for both sides.&quot; Following the meeting, Trump said that Zelensky is &quot;not a man who wants to make peace.&quot; Before leaving for his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump told reporters that Ukrainian president was &quot;looking for something that I&apos;m not looking for&quot; and again asserted that Zelenskyy wanted to &quot;fight, fight, fight.&quot; &quot;Either we&apos;re going to end it or let him fight it out, and if he fights it out, it&apos;s not going to be pretty because without us, he doesn&apos;t win,&quot; Trump said. Zelensky pushed back on Trump&apos;s comments during his interview asserting that Ukraine is &quot;ready for peace but we need to be in a good position.&quot; &quot;We want peace... that&apos;s why I visited President Trump,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that he hopes that Trump would show stronger support for Ukraine rather than positioning himself as a mediator in the war. He emphasized that Russia was the aggressor, having launched the invasion. &quot;I want really him to be more at our side,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine&apos;s president told Fox News&apos; Bret Baier that he doesn&#x2019;t feel he needs to apologize to Trump after a heated exchange at the White House. &quot;No, I respect president, and I respect American people, and I think that we have to be very open and very honest and I&#x2019;m not sure that we did something bad,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;I think some things we have to discuss out of media with all respect to democracy and free media.&quot; When asked if Zelensky though the relationship could be salvaged following the tense exchange, Zelensky replied: &quot;Yes, of course, because it&apos;s more than to the president. It&apos;s a historical relations between our people.&quot; When asked is the confrontation, initiated by Vice President JD Vance, was preplanned, Zelensky replied &quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/this-kind-of-spat-is-not-good-for-both-sides-zelensky-says-following-oval-office-clash-with-trump/	2025-02-28T16:48:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2202537831.jpg

The Kyiv Independent has compiled instances where Zelensky has publicly expressed gratitude to the U.S., its people, and its leadership for being Ukraine&#x2019;s largest supporter.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-thanks-america-for-four-minutes-straight/	2025-02-28T16:11:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-01_01-54-56.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Zelensky, Trump get into heated argument while speaking with journalists in Oval Office	Key developments on Feb. 28: President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump held a 45-minute-long press briefing in the Oval Office that ended in a heated argument about American aid to Ukraine, and the canceling of the planned signing of the U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement. In a post on Truth Social after the meeting, Trump said that Zelensky &quot;disrespected the United States of America in the cherished Oval Office.&quot; &quot;He can come back when he is ready for peace,&quot; he added. Zelensky met Trump in Washington on Feb. 28 as the two leaders were expected to sign a framework deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources. But during a press conference, a scuffle began following Zelensky&apos;s answer to U.S. Vice President JD Vance&apos;s comments. In response to a journalist&#x2019;s question that Trump and his administration were aligning themselves with President Vladimir Putin and Russia, Vance interjected, saying that former President Joe Biden had done nothing to end the war in Ukraine through diplomatic means. &quot;The path to peace and the path to prosperity is engaging in diplomacy. What makes America is a good country is America engaging in diplomacy. That is what President Trump is doing,&quot; Vance said. Zelensky responded by explaining the history of Russian aggression against Ukraine that began in 2014 with Russia&#x2019;s invasion in the east and the annexation of Crimea, noting that Moscow had broken a ceasefire deal negotiated in 2019 through diplomatic efforts with France and Germany. &quot;What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?&quot; Zelensky asked. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; &quot;I&#x2019;m talking about the kind of diplomacy that&#x2019;s going to end the destruction of your country,&quot; Vance said in response. It was at that point that Vance became noticeably irritated and began chastising Zelensky. &quot;Mr. President, with respect, I think it&apos;s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media,&quot; Vance said. &quot;Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems. You should be thanking the President for trying to bring an end to this conflict.&quot; Zelensky asked Vance if he&apos;d been to Ukraine himself to see the problems the country faced. &quot;I&apos;ve been... I&apos;ve actually seen and watched the stories,&quot; Vance said. At one point when Zelensky began to respond, Trump said: &quot;You&apos;ve done a lot of talking. Your country is in big trouble. You&apos;re not winning this.&quot; &quot;We are staying, Mr. President, we are staying in our country, staying strong. From the very beginning of the war, we&apos;ve been alone. And we are thankful. I said thanks in this Cabinet,&quot; Zelensky responded. &quot;You are not in a good position. You don&apos;t have the right cards right now,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I&apos;m not playing cards,&quot; Zelensky responded. &quot;You&apos;re gambling with World War III. You&apos;re gambling with World War III! And what you&apos;re doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country. It&apos;s back to you,&quot; Trump said. Trump also said Ukraine had not been alone because &quot;stupid&quot; former President Biden gave Kyiv military aid. &quot;If you didn&apos;t have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks. Okay?&quot; Trump added. &quot;You&apos;ve gotta be more thankful&quot; -- remarkable scenes out of the White House as Trump and JD Vance team up to do Putin&apos;s bidding and demean Zelenskyy pic.twitter.com/wjp8UfqN0G Trump said it was going to be a &quot;very hard thing to do business like this&quot; before Vance falsely suggested Zelensky had never thanked the U.S. for aid. Zelensky once again said he was thankful before Trump accused him of not being serious about wanting a ceasefire. &quot;You&#x2019;re buried there. You&#x2019;re &#x2026; people are dying. You&apos;re running low on soldiers,&quot; he said. &quot;Of course, we want to stop the war,&quot; Zelensky replied. &quot;But you&apos;re saying you don&apos;t want a ceasefire? I want a ceasefire. Because you&#x2019;ll get a ceasefire faster than an agreement,&quot; Trump said. &quot;It&#x2019;s going to make great television,&quot; Trump said after the argument. The press briefing ended shortly after. In one of the videos posted online, Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova is seen shaking her head in disbelief.

Zelensky&apos;s visit was preceded by weeks of tense negotiations as Ukraine rejected the initial two draft mineral deal proposals, presenting them as one-sided obligations for Ukraine without any security commitments on Washington&apos;s side. The long-debated agreement would have established a fund to which Ukraine would contribute 50% of proceeds from the future monetization of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) was instructed by the State Department to terminate initiatives set to help restore Ukraine&apos;s energy grid, NBC News reported, citing two USAID officials working on the matter. The termination was finalized prior to Zelensky&apos;s visit to Washington. &#x201C;It significantly undercuts this administration&#x2019;s abilities to negotiate on the ceasefire, and it&#x2019;d signal to Russia that we don&#x2019;t care about Ukraine or our past investments,&#x201D; a USAID official told NBC News. Russia has launched more than 30 mass strikes on Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure over the three years of its full-scale invasion, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said on Feb. 24. &quot;Each large-scale attack on the energy sector involves 100-200, and now 3,000 different munitions that simultaneously hit power generation facilities, substations, power lines, and gas infrastructure,&quot; Halushchenko wrote on Facebook. Russia continues to target Ukrainian energy infrastructure, testing Ukraine&apos;s resolve as the country endures another winter. Material losses from Russian attacks have amounted to &quot;billions of dollars,&quot; according to the minister. USAID has funded a wide range of initiatives in Ukraine, from energy security to civil society development. Trump ordered a 90-day freeze on all foreign assistance upon taking office, effectively halting USAID-funded programs worldwide. Ukraine is working to secure alternative funding sources for critical programs previously supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and has already reached preliminary agreements on some, Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna said on Feb. 7. &quot;The negotiations are ongoing. Ministers in the Ukrainian government have held meetings on critical programs &#x2014; Energy, Infrastructure, Digital Transformation, and Justice Ministries,&quot; she said at a conference attended by the Kyiv Independent. Stefanishyna emphasized that urgent funding has already been identified for recovery efforts, energy resilience, and cyber defense projects. President Donald Trump is considering ending ongoing shipments of military aid to Ukraine following a heated exchange in the White House between Trump and Zelensky, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Feb. 28, citing a senior Trump administration official. Zelensky has repeatedly urged the U.S. to continue shipping arms to Ukraine as a security guarantee that would strengthen Kyiv&apos;s position in future peace negotiations with Russia. After taking office on Jan. 20, the Trump administration was initially inclined to stop all aid to Ukraine, but has since continued to send weapons to the embattled nation. The Trump administration has said it would not support additional weapons shipments, but has not halted weapons shipments that were started under the previous Biden administration. Trump signed an executive order on the first day of his term freezing foreign aid funding for 90 days. Reuters reported in early February that opposing factions within the administration had been debating whether the U.S. should continue providing weapons. The U.S. has provided Ukraine with $65.9 billion in military aid since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Russian officials commented on the heated exchange between Zelensky and Trump at the White House on Feb. 28, calling the clash &quot;historic&quot; and &quot;a livid reprimand from the Oval Office.&quot; Kremlin adviser Kirill Dmitriev called the argument &quot;historic&quot; in a post on X. Dmitriev serves as special envoy to Russian President Vladimir Putin and took part in the recent direct talks between the U.S. and Russia in Saudi Arabia. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev praised Trump for telling &quot;the truth,&quot; calling the argument &quot;a livid reprimand&quot; delivered to an &quot;ungrateful&quot; Zelensky. Medvedev, currently a deputy chairman of Russia&apos;s Security Council, has made numerous inflammatory statements on social media platforms and has openly challenged Ukraine&apos;s right to exist as an independent nation. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni called on Feb. 28 for an &quot;immediate&quot; summit between the United States, EU, and Western allies to discuss Ukraine amid ongoing peace talks. Meloni&apos;s call for the summit follows a heated meeting between Zelensky and Trump in the White House on Feb. 28 that culminated in the Ukrainian delegation being ordered to leave the White House. The meeting ended without an agreement on a mineral deal after a 45-minute press briefing escalated into a heated exchange over U.S. aid to Ukraine and the conditions of a potential peace deal with Russia. Meloni called for the summit to &quot;talk frankly about how we intend to deal with the great challenges of today, starting with Ukraine, which together we have defended in recent years, and those that we will be called upon to face in the future,&quot; according to a statement. &quot;Any division of the West makes us all weaker and favors those who would like to see the decline of our civilization. A decline not of its power or influence, but of the principles that founded it, first and foremost freedom. A division would not benefit anyone,&quot; the statement continued. Italy will be communicating with allies to propose the meeting &quot;in the coming hours.&quot; Meloni&apos;s proposal comes as a number of European leaders on Feb. 28 reaffirmed their support for Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky, following his tense meeting. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said that &quot;Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader,&quot; following the exchange. The proposed summit follows one that French President Emmanuel Macron convened in Paris on Feb. 17, that brought together leaders from Europe&apos;s largest nations and Britain, as well as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and top EU officials. European allies have become increasingly concerned that they will not have a role in negotiations between the U.S. and Russia&apos;s about ending the war &#x2014; talks that Kyiv has also been sidelined from. A number of European leaders on Feb. 28 reaffirmed their support for Ukraine and Zelensky, following his tense meeting with Trump at the White House. &quot;Dear Volodymyr Zelensky, dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone,&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on X. Zelensky met with Trump in the Oval Office, where they were expected to finalize a framework deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources. The meeting ended without an agreement after a 45-minute press briefing escalated into a heated exchange over U.S. aid to Ukraine and the conditions of a potential peace deal with Russia. Zelensky left the White House early without signing the minerals deal, which had been the focus of weeks of negotiations between Washington and Kyiv. Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that. In response to the meeting, French President Emmanuel Macron reiterated that Russia is the aggressor in its war against Ukraine. &quot;There is an aggressor, which is Russia, and an attacked people, which is Ukraine,&quot; Macron told reporters in Portugal. &quot;We must thank all those who helped, and we must respect those who have been fighting since the beginning.&quot; According to Christopher Miller, the Financial Times&apos; chief correspondent in Kyiv, Zelensky spoke by phone with Macron and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte following the clash with Trump. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reaffirmed the EU&apos;s commitment to supporting Ukraine. &quot;Your dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people. Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone, dear President Volodymyr Zelensky,&quot; she posted. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas emphasized the EU&apos;s commitment to stepping up assistance to Ukraine, enabling the country to continue resisting the aggressor. &quot;Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader.

Friedrich Merz, leader of Germany&apos;s conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), echoed similar sentiments, saying, &quot;We must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war.&quot; German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock emphasized that Germany, along with its European allies, remains firmly on Ukraine&apos;s side against Russian aggression. Moldovan President Maia Sandu underscored Ukraine&apos;s broader role in defending freedom. &quot;The truth is simple. Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia is the aggressor,&quot; she wrote on X. Czech President Petr Pavel expressed strong support for Ukraine, saying that the country stands with Ukraine more than ever. &quot;Time for Europe to step up its efforts,&quot; he said. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala also voiced support, writing, &quot;We stand with Ukraine and on the side of the free world.&quot; Officials from Spain, Lithuania, Latvia, Norway, and the Netherlands also issued statements reaffirming their commitment to Ukraine in the wake of the White House meeting. Russian forces attempted to cross the Russia-Ukraine border in Sumy Oblast near the village of Novenke on Feb. 25 but were repelled, Dmytro Lyhkovii, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, told the Interfax-Ukraine news agency on Feb. 28. Moscow&apos;s troops have since then continued in attempts to carry out attacks in the area, Lykhovii said amid recent reports on Russian forces attempting to storm the border. The spokesperson&apos;s comments follow the DeepState monitoring group marking Novenke as a contested area, suggesting that Russian forces crossed the border into Sumy Oblast. The village of Novenke lies just across the border, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the regional center, Sumy. Northeastern Sumy Oblast borders Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukrainian forces launched an incursion last summer to draw away Moscow&apos;s troops from Donbas and disrupt Russian plans for an offensive from the north. &quot;On Feb. 25, (Russia) stormed this section of the border (at Novenke) with forces of up to two mechanized units, crossed the state border of Ukraine, but was blocked and thrown back to the territory of the Russian Federation,&quot; Lykhovii told Interfax-Ukraine. &quot;Subsequently, Russian troops continue to attempt assault actions, now with infantry groups.&quot; Novenke, Sumy Oblast, as of Feb. 28, 2025. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation, said that Russia has been carrying out infantry assaults near Novenke for several days, leading to localized skirmishes at the border. Kovalenko denied that the attacks would mark the start of a new offensive as Russia does not have &quot;neither the strength nor the means for this.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, the Russian military claimed. Russian casualties have reached nearly 40,000 in Kursk Oblast, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 6. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said last November that the incursion thwarted Russia&apos;s plans to invade Sumy Oblast in an attempt to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; in the region.

Trump may halt all military aid to Ukraine following Oval Office clash, WP reports	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. President Donald Trump is considering ending ongoing shipments of military aid to Ukraine following a heated exchange in the White House between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Feb. 28, citing a senior Trump administration official. The meeting between Trump and Zelensky ended without an agreement on a mineral deal after a 45-minute press briefing that escalated into a heated exchange over U.S. aid to Ukraine and the conditions of a potential peace deal with Russia. Trump later ordered his officials to tell the Ukrainian officials to leave the White House, despite protest from the Ukrainian delegation. Zelensky has repeatedly urged the U.S. to continue shipping arms to Ukraine as a security guarantee that would strengthen Kyiv&apos;s position in future peace negotiations with Russia. After taking office on Jan. 20, the Trump administration was initially inclined to stop all aid to Ukraine, but has since continued to send weapons to the embattled nation. The Trump administration has said it would not support additional weapons shipments, but has not halted weapons shipments that were started under the previous Biden administration. Trump signed an executive order on the first day of his term freezing foreign aid funding for 90 days. Reuters reported in early February that opposing factions within the administration had been debating whether the U.S. should continue providing weapons. The U.S. has provided Ukraine with $65.9 billion in military aid since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-may-halt-all-military-aid-to-ukraine-following-oval-office-clash-wp-reports/	2025-02-28T14:46:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2181306833.jpg
Editorial: A president just disrespected America in the Oval Office. It wasn’t Zelensky	It&#x2019;s time to say it plainly. America&#x2019;s leadership has switched sides in the war. The American people have not, and they should speak up. In the past several weeks, the U.S. leadership has demonstrated explicit hostility towards Ukraine and aligned its rhetoric and policy with Russia. The animosity culminated today when U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Ukraine&#x2019;s President Volodymyr Zelensky at a meeting in the Oval Office. After a hostile meeting, Zelensky left the White House. Trump reportedly ordered the Ukrainian delegation out. Let this sink in. The president of a battered Ukraine, an ally of the U.S., became the first world leader in history to be kicked out of the White House. Not a dictator, not a disgraced politician &#x2014; the president of Ukraine, a country suffering from the worst invasion in the 21st century. The country that the U.S. administration swore to bring peace to. In an ugly exchange, the president and vice president joined forces to admonish Zelensky for &#x201C;not being grateful&#x201D; enough for the help Ukraine was getting. To that, Zelensky reminded them that he had thanked the American people multiple times, including earlier that day. But it appears that gratitude to the American people isn&#x2019;t what Trump and Vance were looking for &#x2014; they wanted him to grovel and prostrate himself in front of Trump. Kiss the ring. For sure, Zelensky could have done a better job composing himself and restraining his reactions, but it&#x2019;s fair to say that he was put in a situation he couldn&#x2019;t win. If he let Trump and Vance &#x2014; and apparently, it takes two of them to win a verbal argument against one non-native English speaker &#x2014; continue their line of attack on Ukraine, unchecked, he would be seen as weak both at home and abroad. Weakness is something a country at war can&#x2019;t afford to project. Trump didn&#x2019;t get into the same kind of arguments with other world leaders who publicly disagreed with him during recent meetings. He smiled and shrugged when French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer corrected him and Vance on their provocative and false statements about Europe. Will Trump and Vance hit Vladimir Putin with the same attitude they showed towards Zelensky and scold the Russian leader for attacking Ukraine? By now, we&#x2019;ve seen enough to know for sure that they won&#x2019;t. If any ring-kissing happens in their meeting with Putin, the ring will be Russian. During the heated exchange in the Oval Office, Trump even complained that Zelensky has &#x201C;hatred&#x201D; for Putin &#x2014; the man who ordered an invasion of his country, killing thousands of civilians &#x2014; saying it would be &#x201C;tough&#x201D; for him to &#x201C;make a deal with that kind of hate.&#x201D; After the meeting, Trump claimed that Zelensky didn&#x2019;t want peace. That&#x2019;s a dangerous lie. Let&#x2019;s be clear. There is only one force in the world that can bring peace unilaterally, at any moment: Russia. Putin can order his troops to leave Ukraine and end the war any minute he wants. But Putin doesn&#x2019;t want peace, he wants Ukraine. Zelensky, and Ukraine, want a fair peace &#x2014; one that would bring security to the embattled country and pay honor to the enormous price that it paid, losing the best of its people in a bloody fight against the invader. What happened in the Oval Office is unprecedented, but it&#x2019;s not entirely a surprise. Throughout the weeks leading up to it, Trump has demonstrated hostility towards Zelensky and Ukraine, while embracing Russia. We&#x2019;ve seen it in the things he has said and done. At every turn, there were people that stayed optimistic and tried to interpret it in a way that isn&#x2019;t so bad for Ukraine &#x2014; saying it&#x2019;s part of a strategy, or that it&#x2019;s different from what goes on behind the scenes. It appears it&#x2019;s much simpler than that. Today, Trump said that he is both &#x201C;for Ukraine and Russia&#x201D; in the talks. Then, he kicked Ukraine&#x2019;s delegation out of the White House. There is only one simple way to understand what happened: Donald Trump is for Russia. The president of the United States picked Russia&#x2019;s side in the war it started against its democratic neighbor &#x2014; whose only fault was that it wanted to stay a democracy. Trump is choosing to side with a murderous tyrant over a democratically elected leader. Trump and his government are now making sure Ukraine will lose this war. They are also choking their other allies in the process. But most importantly, they are betraying the interests of America, and making it weaker. The tragedy is that Trump is doing it all in the name of millions of Americans who completely disagree with that and are disgusted with Trump&#x2019;s line. The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s emails have been overflowing with words of support, embarrassment, disgust, and apologies from our American readers who support Ukraine and disagree with Trump&#x2019;s actions. But the U.S. remains a democracy, whether its leadership cherishes it or not &#x2014; and in a democracy, the people&#x2019;s voices can and must be heard. If you disagree with America&#x2019;s current trajectory, with the idea that emboldening tyrants is the path to sustainable peace and prosperity, you have the power to make a difference: Call and email your representatives. Demand support for Ukraine. Organize and go to pro-Ukraine rallies. Write, post, speak, advocate. Donate to Ukrainian causes. Disagree. You are America &#x2014; make your voice heard. Americans should stand up and send their political leadership a clear message: We don&#x2019;t support what you&#x2019;re doing, so stop doing it in our name. We don&#x2019;t want an alliance with Russia, and we don&#x2019;t want a betrayal of Ukraine. And frankly, we are embarrassed. Speak up now, before it&#x2019;s too late. America&#x2019;s president may have chosen his side of history. The American people are still free to choose theirs.	https://kyivindependent.com/editorial-a-president-just-disrespected-america-in-the-oval-office-it-wasnt-zelensky/	2025-02-28T14:17:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201823715.jpg

Mixed reactions from U.S. officials, lawmakers emerge following Oval Office clash	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. lawmakers and officials voiced mixed reaction following a heated exchange between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 28, that culminated in the Ukrainian delegation being ordered to leave the White House. Zelensky departed in his motorcade around 1:45 p.m. local time, without holding a joint news conference scheduled for later in the day, after the two leaders got into a heated argument while speaking with journalists in the Oval Office. A source familiar with the matter told CNN that the mineral deal between the U.S. and Ukraine was not signed following the tense exchange. Elon Musk, tapped by Trump to be the appointed head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) said on X that &quot;Zelensky destroyed himself in the eyes of the American people.&quot; Zelensky destroyed himself in the eyes of the American people Musk, who is often critical of support for Ukraine, reportedly threatened to shut off Starlink in Ukraine unless Kyiv agreed to a minerals deal, a claim he later denied. Musk&apos;s comments echo those of senior Republican Senator Lindsey Graham who told Fox News after the exchance in the White House that he was &quot;proud of President Trump.&quot; &quot;(Trump) wants to end the war and Zelensky felt like he needed to bait Trump in the Oval Office,&quot; Graham said, added that Zelensky &quot;is either going to have to fundamentally change or go.&quot; Graham, a staunch supporter of Trump, has previously visited Ukraine and voiced support for Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast during a visit to Kyiv on Aug. 12. Graham previously called on the Biden administration to support Russia&apos;s inclusion in the list of countries sponsoring terrorism. &#x1F6A8;BREAKING: Unfortunately, America was disrespected and the deal is off.

NBC: US terminated support for Ukraine's energy grid restoration	The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) was instructed by the State Department to terminate initiatives set to help restore Ukraine&apos;s energy grid, NBC News reported citing two USAID officials working on the matter. The termination was finalized prior to President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s visit to Washington. &#x201C;It significantly undercuts this administration&#x2019;s abilities to negotiate on the ceasefire, and it&#x2019;d signal to Russia that we don&#x2019;t care about Ukraine or our past investments,&#x201D; a USAID official told NBC News. Russia has launched more than 30 mass strikes on Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure over the three years of its full-scale invasion, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said on Feb. 24. &quot;Each large-scale attack on the energy sector involves 100-200, and now 3,000 different munitions that simultaneously hit power generation facilities, substations, power lines, and gas infrastructure,&quot; Halushchenko wrote on Facebook. Russia continues to target Ukrainian energy infrastructure, testing Ukraine&apos;s resolve as the country is enduring another winter. Material losses from Russian attacks have amounted to &quot;billions of dollars,&quot; according to the minister. USAID has funded a wide range of initiatives in Ukraine, from energy security to civil society development. U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a 90-day freeze on all foreign assistance upon taking office, effectively halting USAID-funded programs worldwide. Ukraine is working to secure alternative funding sources for critical programs previously supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and has already reached preliminary agreements on some, Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna said on Feb. 7. &quot;The negotiations are ongoing. Ministers in the Ukrainian government have held meetings on critical programs &#x2014; Energy, Infrastructure, Digital Transformation, and Justice Ministries,&quot; she said at a conference attended by the Kyiv Independent. Stefanishyna emphasized that urgent funding has already been identified for recovery efforts, energy resilience, and cyber defense projects.	https://kyivindependent.com/nbc-us-terminated-support-of-ukraine-energy-grid-restoration/	2025-02-28T12:21:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1247620452.jpg
Kremlin officials praise Trump's treatment of Zelensky	Russian officials commented on the heated exchange between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Feb. 28, calling the clash &quot;historic&quot; and &quot;a livid reprimand from the Oval Office.&quot; Kremlin adviser Kirill Dmitriev called the argument &quot;historic&quot; in a post on X. &#xA0; Dmitriev serves as special envoy to Russian President Vladimir Putin and took part in the recent direct talks between the U.S. and Russia in Saudi Arabia. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev praised Trump for telling &quot;the truth,&quot; calling the argument &quot;a livid reprimand&quot; delivered to an &quot;ungrateful&quot; Zelensky. Medvedev, currently a deputy chairman of Russia&apos;s Security Council, has made numerous inflammatory statements on social media platforms and has openly challenged Ukraine&apos;s right to exist as an independent nation. During an Oval Office meeting earlier today, Zelensky, Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance got into an increasingly tense argument regarding U.S. aid to Ukraine and Ukraine&apos;s ability to trust a ceasefire with Russia in the absence of concrete security guarantees. In the exchange, Vance berated Zelensky for not being more grateful for U.S. aid. &quot;You&apos;re not in a good position. You don&apos;t have the cards right now,&quot; Trump said, raising his voice and speaking over Zelensky. &quot;I&apos;m not playing cards,&quot; Zelensky responded. Following the argument, Zelensky reportedly left the White House on Trump&apos;s orders, without signing the critical minerals deal between the U.S. and Ukraine. Trump said on social media following the meeting that Zelensky &quot;disrespected&quot; the U.S. and wasn&apos;t ready for peace.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-envoy-calls-trump-zelensky-clash-historic/	2025-02-28T12:03:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1243385348.jpg
Zelensky thanks US after tense meeting with Trump	President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the United States for it&apos;s ongoing support of Ukraine in a social media post following a tense meeting at the White House on Feb. 28. &quot;Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit,&quot; Zelensky wrote on X. &quot;Thank you POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.&quot; Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that. Zelensky&apos;s thanks followed a heated argument with U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance in the White House, during which the American leaders berated him for being insufficiently grateful for U.S. aid. Zelensky left the meeting without holding the planned press conference with Trump or signing the much-anticipated critical minerals deal with the U.S. Trump reportedly ordered Zelensky and the Ukrainian delegation to leave the White House after the Oval Office argument. Following the meeting, Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social that Zelensky had &quot;disrespected&quot; the U.S. and could return to the White House &quot;when he is ready for peace.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-thanks-us-after-tense-meeting-with-trump/	2025-02-28T11:43:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164821112.jpg
There is an aggressor, which is Russia,' says Macron after Zelensky-Trump clash	French President Emmanuel Macron emphasized that Russia is the aggressor in its war against Ukraine following a heated exchange between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Feb. 28. &quot;There is an aggressor, which is Russia, and an attacked people, which is Ukraine,&quot; Macron told reporters in Portugal. He emphasized that supporting Ukraine and sanctioning Russia was the right decision three years ago and remains so today. &quot;We must thank all those who helped, and we must respect those who have been fighting since the beginning,&quot; he added. Zelensky met Trump in the Oval Office as the two leaders were expected to sign a framework deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources. His visit followed weeks of tense negotiations. Ukraine rejected two initial draft proposals, arguing that they imposed one-sided obligations on Kyiv without security commitments from Washington. The meeting ended without a deal after a 45-minute press briefing between Zelensky and Trump turned heated over U.S. aid to Ukraine and the conditions of a potential peace deal with Russia. Following the talks, Trump said that Zelensky &quot;is not ready for peace&quot; and accused him of disrespecting the U.S. in the Oval Office. &quot;He can come back when he is ready for peace,&quot; Trump posted on Truth Social. Zelensky left the White House early without signing a mineral deal with the United States following a heated exchange with Trump. Macron&apos;s trip to Portugal followed a visit to Washington, where he sought to convince Trump to commit to post-war security guarantees for Ukraine. The French president has reportedly failed to receive any clear commitments from Trump, with an undisclosed EU official describing the trip as a &quot;waste of time&quot; in comments for Politico. The issue of security guarantees has been linked to the potential deployment of a European-led peacekeeping force in Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. The Washington Post reported on Feb. 17 that up to 30,000 European troops could be sent to Ukraine to monitor a ceasefire.	https://kyivindependent.com/there-is-an-aggressor-which-is-russia-says-macron-after-zelensky-trump-clash/	2025-02-28T11:42:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1977990485.jpg
Polish PM Tusk says Ukraine 'not alone' after Trump-Zelensky clash	Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk voiced supported for Ukraine following the dispute between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Feb. 28. &quot;Dear Volodymyr Zelensky, dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone,&quot; Tusk wrote on X. Zelensky met Trump in the Oval Office as the two leaders were expected to sign a framework deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources. His visit followed weeks of tense negotiations. Ukraine rejected two initial draft proposals, arguing that they imposed one-sided obligations on Kyiv without security commitments from Washington. The meeting culminated in a 45-minute press briefing, which ended in a heated exchange over U.S. aid to Ukraine and the conditions of a potential peace deal with Russia. Following the talks, Trump said that Zelensky &quot;is not ready for peace&quot; and accused him of disrespecting the U.S. in the Oval Office. &quot;He can come back when he is ready for peace,&quot; Trump posted on Truth Social. Zelensky has since left the White House, according to Reuters. Poland has been a key ally of Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, providing extensive military aid, including tanks, heavy equipment, and ammunition. Warsaw has delivered 45 military aid packages to Kyiv since 2022, totaling over $4 billion, according to former Ukrainian Ambassador to Poland Vasyl Zvarych.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-pm-tusk-voices-support-for-ukraine-amid-zelensky-trump-clash/	2025-02-28T11:21:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183928589.jpg
Zelensky leaves White House early following following heated exchange with Trump; minerals deal left unsigned	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky left the White House early without signing a rare earth mineral deal with the United States following a heated exchange with President Donald Trump on Feb. 28. Zelensky departed in his motorcade around 1:45 p.m. local time, without holding a joint news conference scheduled for later in the day. A source familiar with the matter told CNN that rare earth minerals deal between the U.S. and Ukraine was not signed following the tense exchange. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 28, after meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House, that Zelensky &quot;is not ready for peace.&quot; &quot;He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for peace,&quot; Trump posted on TruthSocial. This came as the two leaders got into a heated argument while speaking with journalists in the Oval Office.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-leaves-white-house-early-following-following-heated-exchange-with-trump-minerals-deal-left-unsigned/	2025-02-28T11:02:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2202528427-1.jpg
We asked Americans about Trump’s Ukraine policy. Here’s what they said	The Kyiv Independent invited its American readers to share their thoughts on U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s policy on Ukraine and Russia on Feb. 24, the third-year anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. In less than a day, we received over 400 emails, expressing views that ranged from cautious skepticism about the U.S. approach to Ukraine to outright condemnation of Trump&#x2019;s statements on the issue. After carefully reviewing the responses, we are publishing a selection that reflects both the thematic and geographical diversity of the feedback. &quot;I am extremely disappointed with the Trump administration&#x2019;s handling of the negotiations. How can they negotiate without Ukraine at the table? Why did they publicly give away any negotiation positions? This is nuts! The Trump administration&apos;s position that Russia was provoked to attack Ukraine is preposterous&#x2014;making Russia the victim is preposterous. Calling Zelensky a dictator and not Putin is insane.&quot; &#x2014; Tom Livingston (Spokane, Washington) &quot;Regarding Team Trump&apos;s approach to Ukraine and Russia, I am feeling most of the same emotions as the rest of your American readership: disgust, shame, anger, worry. The Ukrainian people have had to deal with unimaginable tragedy and yet continue to fight relentlessly every day. Thank God for their strength. I only wish they didn&apos;t have to continue being this strong.&quot; &#x2014; Josh Onkala (Dearborn, Michigan) &quot;For America to engineer the conquering of this century&#x2019;s best ally and to punish it by plundering its mineral wealth &#x2014; which is a greater share of GDP than the reparations demanded of Germany at Versailles &#x2014; is shooting itself in the foot and wasting the lives of good Ukrainians.&quot; &#x2014; Eli Crowley (Albuquerque, New Mexico) &quot;While the idea of peace talks overall is a good one, any discussion of peace that involves Ukraine having to give up something should involve Ukraine. With Trump&apos;s increasing comments revealing his pro-Russian sentiment, I feel so ashamed to have him as my president for the next four years. Every comment diminishes the idea I had back in November that I could just ride the next four years out completely fine like 2016 to 2020. Instead, we are going into a world where the president of the &apos;land of the free&apos; is bending over backward for autocracy. This is the most shameful act of a president in my lifetime.&quot; &#x2014; Brian Mai (California) &quot;Americans have always been proud to be the beacon of democracy, and we have always been eager to promote freedom. It looks like those days are gone. I am embarrassed by our &apos;leader,&apos; but as a Christian, I believe God is in control and pray for your country for a fast end to this terrible war.&quot; &#x2014; Jeff Borger (Ocala, Florida) &quot;Although congressional Republicans have largely edged on the side of cautious compliance with the administration, some are now choosing to speak strongly in favor of Ukraine despite the risks. It was refreshing to see Sen. Thom Tillis (N.C.) rearticulate Putin&#x2019;s &apos;threat to democracy&apos; and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick&#x2019;s (Pa.-1) commitment to do &apos;whatever it takes&apos; to bring the war to a just and sustainable end, just to name a few. Although weakened, I am guardedly hopeful that bipartisan support for Ukraine in Congress remains and that Congress can become a voice of reason and a partner for lasting peace in Ukraine.&quot; &#x2014; Cody Fritz (Washington, D.C.) &quot;If we demand that Ukraine hand over its mineral resources in exchange for support, we will signal to our allies that they need not think of us as anything more than short-term partners. This is especially true given that Trump is demanding payment not for future help, but for aid that was already given. If he succeeds, no nation will trust any prior agreement with the United States, and without these agreements, we will be substantially weaker.&quot; &#x2014; David Papiasvili (Brooklyn, New York) &quot;Any &apos;deal&apos; that Trump makes with Putin will surely benefit the aggressor.&quot; &#x2014; Andrew Kelly (Abilene, Texas) &quot;While I want the war to end, I believe Trump is the one who has been &apos;played,&apos; as evidenced by the Kremlin&#x2019;s talking points now coming out of Trump&#x2019;s own mouth. It appears the Trump administration&#x2019;s plan to negotiate peace is to give Putin everything he wants, blame Ukraine for standing up to Russia, and extort precious resources from Ukraine without providing any security guarantees.&quot; &#x2014; Chris Twiggs (Fernandina Beach, Florida) &quot;Any deal between Ukraine and Russia must be very fair to Ukraine, as they were invaded and suffered greatly. What about Russian compensation to Ukraine? What about the return of all Ukrainian children taken to Russia? The deal is about more than money and minerals.&quot; &#x2014; James Casey, Esq., CPP (San Antonio, Texas)&quot;The moment I respected President Trump the most was when he responded against Bashar al-Assad during his first presidency. That strength is needed against Putin. A victory for Ukraine is a victory for all of the free world and free peoples everywhere. I am proud to be Ukrainian. I am proud that Ukraine inspires people around the world to stand up to tyranny.&quot; &#x2014; David Goncharuk (Dalton, Georgia) &quot;Maybe it is because Americans have not had a war on our land and we have become too comfortable. Maybe we have forgotten the value of freedom, and quite possibly, we have no idea what the definition of freedom is altogether. We definitely do not believe just how fast we could lose it. Too many believe conspiracies that Ukraine provoked Russia to have no choice but to invade, and I fear the misinformation has infected both the populace and our government.&quot; &#x2014; Tara Laraway (New York City, New York)&quot;Trump is an absolute disgrace to Americans. The example of how he handled the Gaza situation in an effort to grab land from a vulnerable group of people indicates his motive for peace talks for Ukraine &#x2014; he only wants access to rare minerals. It also showcases his efforts to try and obtain Greenland. I have a tremendous amount of respect for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. Most intelligent and kindhearted Americans feel the same sentiments.&quot; &#x2014; Amanda Killanbury (Midwest) &quot;Trump wants to get credit for bringing the war to an end. But the peace needs to be a righteous peace, not a surrender. I think Trump should use U.S. troops to go in and get some rare earth minerals and open the way to free Donetsk and Luhansk.&quot; &#x2014; Michaela Hochmuth (Bowie, Maryland)&quot;The honorable course that I wish the administration would follow would be to sit down with Zelensky to determine the support level necessary to win this war decisively and then take the required political and military steps to achieve that level of support as soon as possible. Stop discussing support for Ukraine as a political issue and recognize it as a necessity for the safety and security of all countries and peoples. This vacillating support looks like weakness and cowardice and signals the beginning of a new age of expanding imperial powers.&quot; &#x2014; Todd Buchkovich (Tennessee) &quot;Trump has the guts and ability to put Putin in his place but chooses not to. The Russians are hurting&#x2014;economy, supplies, manpower, etc. &#x2014; and now is the time to work toward a better ending for Ukraine. Apply more sanctions wherever needed, supply more and better arms, and provide any other help toward that end. Europe should take a stronger stand than it has in the past, with more money allocated for defense and to help Ukraine&#x2014;along with the U.S. Ukraine can win with the proper help, not the trickled help of the past.&quot; &#x2014; Bob Olaf (Danville, Pennsylvania) &quot;It&#x2019;s frustrating to watch such an ill-informed person play with the lives of millions while remaining completely unaffected himself. Trump treats geopolitics like a reality TV show where everything is just a deal to be made, and the consequences for actual people don&#x2019;t matter. Ukrainians don&#x2019;t get to wake up from this. This isn&#x2019;t some game. It&#x2019;s life or death, and it&#x2019;s sickening that so many people in power are acting like it&#x2019;s anything less.&quot; &#x2014; Michelle Tansey (Yorkville, Illinois) I think Trump&apos;s push to end the war could actually benefit Europe, though at the expense of Ukraine. For Ukrainians, it is even possible that their government might transition from a democracy to a fragile, decentralized system, potentially giving rise to warlord alliances reminiscent of Afghanistan. While this may seem unjust, it is worth noting that the people of Afghanistan faced similar hardships. Life, unfortunately, is often unfair. &#x2014; George Gee (California) &quot;If a peace deal is so easy to achieve, and if Trump is so eager to stop bloodshed, why didn&apos;t he hammer out a peace deal during his first term when there was a hot war in the Donbas?&quot; &#x2014; Catherine Siegel (New York City, New York) &quot;Negotiating without Ukraine at the table disrespects the struggle of a nation fighting against oppression and territorial aggression. It sends a troubling message that the sacrifices of the Ukrainian people are secondary to political maneuvering. This approach not only compromises their sovereignty but also undermines the values we claim to uphold as a nation &#x2014; principles of democracy, self-determination, and respect for human rights.&quot; &#x2014; Jane Rea (Pennsylvania) &quot;I live in the San Francisco Bay Area with two children attending university. My daughter is horrified at Trump&apos;s actions. My son and ex-husband find Trump&apos;s &apos;hard power&apos; appealing. I have to be careful what I say to my son to not drive him away. I refuse to discuss politics. He enjoys watching World War II movies and recently visited Normandy with his grandfather (my dad, who is British). I do not understand how he cannot see the tragedy of not supporting Ukraine. Imagine if the USA did not fight with the Allies against Hitler unless Europe gave up its coal!&quot; &#x2014; Linda Hall (California (California) &quot;Ukraine&#x2019;s fight is about more than territorial sovereignty &#x2014; it is a battle for democracy, self-determination, and the principles of international law. Any approach that suggests &apos;peace&apos; through concessions to Russia is deeply flawed. Russia has repeatedly shown that it does not honor agreements and that any pause in aggression is merely a chance to regroup and strike again. True peace cannot come at the cost of Ukrainian land, people, or future.&quot; &#x2014; Kristy Black (Utah) &quot;I am a former U.S. Marine and a retired law enforcement officer. I have been volunteering in Ukraine since the war began. I am disgusted and livid about the actions of our so-called &apos;president.&apos; It is clear that he has allied himself with dictators and is implementing a transactional foreign policy based not on values or morals, but on profit, greed, and misplaced nationalism. I wore my country&apos;s uniform for almost 30 years. Now, I am embarrassed to be an American.&quot; &#x2014; &#xA0;Mark Cary (Tennessee) &quot;There are so many Americans who support Ukraine in the United States, please don&apos;t take our president&apos;s horrific actions and rhetoric to think that our entire nation feels this way. The propaganda and disinformation in the United States have been extensive, but there are still those of us who support, defend, and advocate for Ukraine &#x2014; and always will. Putin must be stopped. Unfortunately, it appears the United States still has not learned its lesson on appeasement.&quot; &#x2014; Nicole Ellison (North Carolina) &quot;Speaking as a wife whose husband served as a U.S. Department of Defense civilian for 40+ years &#x2014; nearly 10 of which were under Top Secret Security Clearance &#x2014; we&#x2019;ve never been as terrified for the world&#x2019;s safety as we are now. But the only &apos;peace deal&apos; acceptable to us and other true Americans is for Putin to get the fuck out of Ukraine.&quot; &#x2014; Kimberly Willardson (North Carolina)&quot;The VAST majority of Americans do not support our president&#x2019;s betrayal of your country. However, he tends to flip-flop based on who he thinks will win. Go on, show him, show Russia, show the WORLD why you are not to be underestimated, why you are not the underdog in this fight: YOU are the victors of this war, and do not forget it. The world is watching, waiting for you to finish off what we started. Be brave. Be strong.&quot; &#x2014; Skye Anastasion (Salt Lake City, Utah) &quot;I have five adopted children from Ukraine (adopted from Kharkiv in 2010, Khmelnytskyi in 2013 and 2018). My oldest daughter&#x2019;s brother was drafted and sent to the front in 2024. He has been missing since October. I have been a lifelong Republican, and I voted for Trump twice in 2016 and 2020. Trump uses the fact that many Americans do not understand that most of the military aid Ukraine receives went to replenishing our own military equipment as we sent the older items to Ukraine. It was smart for us, smart for Europe, and lifesaving for Ukraine.&quot; &#x2014; Erin Johnson (Virginia) &quot;Outside my house, I fly two flags &#x2014; America&#x2019;s and Ukraine&#x2019;s &#x2014; but I don&#x2019;t know if I can fly the stars and stripes anymore. Currently, Ukraine represents the ideals of the free world better than we do. I regret that we elected Trump, and I can only hope that Europe will step up where we have failed. I am sorry, Ukraine.&quot; &#x2014; Luke Greenway (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) &quot;I believe there is a stronger likelihood that Trump is attempting to strengthen ties with Russia and pursue another &apos;pivot to Asia,&apos; rather than what some pro-Ukraine Republicans suggest &#x2014; that he is trying to pressure Europe into doing more for Ukraine.&quot; &#x2014; Johnny Diaz (NY, New York) &quot;This shift from supporting democratic allies to appeasing authoritarian regimes tarnishes America&#x2019;s global reputation and erodes the principles upon which the nation was built. The lack of empathy in current U.S. foreign policy reflects a broader moral decline. It&#x2019;s disheartening to witness the country I once admired for its commitment to freedom and justice now falter on the world stage. The American flag I knew was a symbol of hope and solidarity. Now, it serves as a reminder of broken promises and misplaced priorities.&quot; &#x2014; Christopher Briscoe (Ashland, Oregon) &quot;I am a long-term supporter of President Trump. My opinion on his handling of the current situation is that I agree with his goal of finding an off-ramp from the war toward peace, but from the knowledge that is publicly available of how that is going, I am having doubts about the current approach. I do not agree with his untruthful rhetoric, and I do not agree with the amount of concessions toward Russia that have been indicated publicly with the lack of concessions in return. Regarding the minerals deal, I agree with the general idea of an economic joint deal between the U.S. and Ukraine involving development of the post-war economy and ties between both nations, but I feel like it needs to include some degree of security guarantees for Ukraine.&quot; &#x2014; Caleb Ford (Missouri) &quot;Although it is true that we have provided billions of dollars to assist Ukraine when the federal government should be investing more in its own people and infrastructure, I do not agree with the American government&apos;s attempt to profit from this war by requiring access to Ukraine&apos;s minerals. It is being painted as an attempt to recoup funds that have been directed to Ukraine, yet we are not doing the same thing to Israel, which has also benefited greatly from our assistance.&quot; &#x2014; Andrew Arslan (New York) &quot;On the positive side, I believe we&apos;re already seeing signs here that there will be massive pushback against Trump&apos;s desire to align the United States with what Reagan called the Evil Empire. Even some normally spineless Republican lawmakers are appalled at Trump&apos;s seeming abandonment of Ukraine.&quot; &#x2014; Valerie Klauscher (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) &quot;Trump is offering Ukraine a Trojan Horse. President Zelensky should be cautious. Trump&#x2019;s loyalties are with dictators, and whatever Trump promises Ukraine, he will have no problem going back on his word.&quot; &#x2014; John Seger (Redmond, Oregon) &quot;America used to be the &apos;good-guys,&apos; I am so sad we are just Putin&apos;s lap dogs now.&quot; &#x2014; Jed Peretz (Portland, Oregon)&quot;My one hope is that even conservative news outlets, like the New York Post and Fox News, question Trump&apos;s rhetoric, which I have rarely seen before, and that the American people as a whole continue to support Ukraine.&quot; &#x2014; Michael O&apos;Connor (New York City, New York) &quot;Ukraine and Russia can, I believe, ultimately achieve a negotiated outcome, one that preserves a secure Ukrainian nation-state, while lessening the threat that Russia sees from a NATO expansion (or similar Western security commitment) into Ukraine. An armed but neutral Ukraine is probably the best hope for peace in Europe; realistic expectations and conversations are the way forward.&quot; &#x2014; John Byrnes (Oak Island North Carolina) &quot;I hope that the rest of the world looks at what is happening in the U.S. and is preparing to treat us as we should be treated &#x2014; as a country in decline, a country going through a constitutional crisis with a democratically elected authoritarian ruler whose primary objectives are all about his own wealth and cronyism. Corruption is rampant. We are no longer a world leader. We should be censured by the rest of the world.&quot; &#x2014; Eva Rick (Montana) &quot;I&#x2019;m disgusted by any potential abandonment of Ukraine. America is tired of the endless Afghan and Iraq wars, sending our finest to fight for countries that wouldn&#x2019;t defend themselves. Supporting Ukraine should have been the perfect antidote; we support, the Ukrainians fight bravely, embarrass Putin, expand NATO, and the U.S. updates its defense industrial base.&quot; &#x2014; Steve Mulvey (Groveland, Florida) &quot;Holding Ukraine hostage over continuing military and recovery support by insisting that the U.S. gets to take as much of their rare earths and resources is an embarrassment to me as a U.S. citizen. It&apos;s like kicking someone when they are down&#x2014;which is exactly the kind of &apos;justice&apos; that Donald Trump likes to mete out to people.&quot; &#x2014; Johnny Roland (Pleasanton, California) &quot;I think all opinions on the outcome of the negotiations and Trump&#x2019;s intentions are premature. Trump&#x2019;s repeated tactics are to praise his opponents in negotiations and, while I don&#x2019;t personally think it&#x2019;s going to work with Putin, I think the opposite &#x2014; calling Putin a &apos;war criminal&apos; etc. &#x2014; would destroy any possibility of a fair agreement.&quot; &#x2014; Bernard Thomas (San Francisco, California) &quot;Trump and his team are trying to break up a fight in the dog park by throwing bones at both parties: this approach intends to force Zelensky to give up and pay up, while purposefully insinuating to Putin that there is a future without retribution for his initial aggression. It is not only insensitive, but dangerous.&quot; &#x2014; Lily Bolash (Connecticut) &quot;I do not believe that Ukraine owes anything to the United States. Ukraine gave up its nuclear capabilities in return for military protection from the U.S. The loss of that is what emboldens Putin to do what he has done. I am confused as to why Donald Trump thinks Ukraine owes &apos;him&apos; anything. I hope your president stands up to him and does not give in.&quot; &#x2014; Elizabeth Lindsey (Katonah, New York) &quot;As an American with connections to Ukraine, I&apos;m absolutely appalled by Trump&apos;s extortionist approach to foreign policy vis-&#xE0;-vis Ukraine. It is nothing short of a monstrous betrayal of a critical ally, parroting Russian disinformation. How can the U.S. be taken seriously as an international partner, if we turn our backs on allies, present deals which amount to economic colonization, and don&apos;t fully support the fundamental rules of international law and sovereignty? I&apos;m shocked and dismayed. Not only that, but Trump&apos;s team has given away any negotiating leverage before talks even started.&quot; &#x2014; Mikaela Inoue (Brunswick, Maine) &quot;There is unfortunately nothing that can be said by even decent Americans to quell the fear that the U.S. is abandoning its commitment to the system that has kept Europe safe since 1945. We should call it what it is &#x2014; a complete and total capitulation to a revisionist, imperialist Russia and a retreat to the isolationism that echoes the interwar period. A chilling truth needs to be recognized: our reversal on Ukraine makes the U.S., at least for the time being, an adversary to open and free societies, and we must be treated accordingly.&quot; &#x2014; Luca Iwasykiw &#xA0;(Washington, D.C.) &quot;The longer Ukraine lasts, the more fragile Russia becomes, and at some point, it will break.&quot; &#x2014; Charles Corfield (Denver, Colorado) &quot;I think that most Americans do not realize that Ukraine gave up a huge stockpile of nuclear weapons and received security guarantees from the U.S. and Russia as signatories. Russia ignored their own promises and did exactly the opposite of those promises by invading Ukraine, starting with Crimea and then trying to destroy the whole country of Ukraine.&quot; &#x2014; Michael Bowe (Winthrop, Maine) &quot;Any peace agreement that cedes Ukrainian territory &#x2014; that, which is currently Russian-occupied or annexed&#x2014;would mean abandoning thousands of Ukrainian citizens and subjecting them to Russian persecution and pro-Kremlin reeducation. Trump&#x2019;s willingness to normalize annexation and occupation seems to serve his own administration&#x2019;s goals, as it turns its own sights on foreign territories.&quot; &#x2014; Marika Olijar and Isabella Palange (Madison, Wisconsin) &quot;Negotiating directly with Russia without European or Ukrainian representatives is a victory for the Russian Federation. Continuing this approach will allow Russia to dictate the future of Europe without opposition. The Russians have previously stated that they want to control territory in southern and eastern Ukraine, and giving this territory to Russia would reward that country for its unprovoked war.&quot; &#x2014; Mark Temnycky (U.S.) &quot;I&apos;m a retired U.S. Marine and have been to Kharkiv (2015) and Odessa (2021). I&apos;m bitterly disappointed with the Trump administration&apos;s policy in this war. In my opinion, President Trump drank the Russians&apos; disinformation campaign Kool-Aid and his ego won&apos;t allow him to admit he&apos;s wrong.&quot; &#x2014; Dudley Garidel (Baton Rouge, Louisiana) &quot;I feel that the U.S. has absolutely betrayed Ukraine. Given the Budapest Memorandum, we should have given Zelensky everything he asked for in a timely manner.&quot; &#x2014; Rich Letrent (Hamilton, NJ USA) &quot;I have fought two wars and was wounded several times for my country. The Marines I lost in those wars knew we were fighting so others could live in relative peace and freedom. We were willing to die just for the possibility of it. They weren&#x2019;t having to pay for their peace, so why would Ukraine have to pay in mineral rights for theirs? The Budapest Memorandum was backed by American values, and Russia knew that. Defending Ukraine should have started in 2014, but we failed, and Europe failed. History and mankind are watching and we are on the wrong side of it.&quot; &#x2014; Thomas W. Whorl (Cambridge, Maryland) &quot;Trump admires Putin because he wants to be Putin, so of course this is unraveling in a terrifying way. And everyone has become so desensitized to all the nonsense mixed with hate speech that we&apos;ve somehow landed here. In what feels like 1930s Germany, except the whole world is involved because social cultures don&apos;t need to bother with physical borders anymore.&quot; &#x2014; Maring Ladd (Chicago, Illinois) &quot;I am appalled by the shifts in policy under the Trump administration. As it begins to partner with Putin and Russia, the Trump administration is becoming complicit in war crimes and crimes against humanity. The approach reminds me of negotiations conducted by mafiosos. The demand for Ukraine&#x2019;s mineral wealth is criminal blackmail. As an old man (77), my solidarity with you and with Ukraine is probably not worth very much, but it is&#x2014;and will be&#x2014;unwavering. Think of me as a student of Timothy Snyder.&quot; &#x2014; Tony Brinkley (Bangor, Maine) &quot;Walk carefully, my friends, Trump is a snake and he cares not for you.&quot; &#x2014; Michael Christie (Michigan) &quot;Although nothing can compare to what sense of betrayal the average Ukrainian must be feeling right now, I have become embarrassed to have seen ourselves align with the dictatorships of Russia and North Korea.&quot; &#x2014; Alex Sanchez (Sacramento, California) &quot;Donald Drumpf (I cannot even bear to say his name) cares only about himself, a classic narcissist. I think he also admires the narcissism of Putin. Both spin lies to gain traction. The good news here might be that Drumpf has notoriously poor follow-through. And his minions are largely unproven idiots.&quot; &#x2014; J. Moor&#x435; (Boulder, Colorado) &quot;The American people, even many who voted for Trump, are horrified at his moves to gut our government of anybody with expertise and his adoption of Kremlin talking points and viewpoints. I can only hope and pray that our Congress grows a spine and shuts this fool down.&quot; &#x2014; JF Smith (Atlanta, Georgia) &quot;There is no precedent in American history for this apparent retreat from support for a democratic nation under attack, let alone for siding with the aggressor nation.&quot; &#x2014; Robert Gillette (Ossipee, New Hampshire) &quot;As a second-generation Ukrainian, I am deeply disgusted by President Trump&#x2019;s blatant betrayal of my friends, my family, and the values that this country claims to uphold. This is not merely a political misstep; it is a moral failing that undermines the very essence of what America claims to represent. For the first time in my life, I feel estranged from this nation, as our ideals of justice and solidarity have been shamelessly discarded by those in power.&quot; &#x2014; Hanna Liszniansky (Cleveland, Ohio) &quot;The American people are not so foolish. We still support your struggle and understand the value of allies like NATO. Our maniac leader wants to surrender your future; we do not.&quot; &#x2014; Dave Roberts (Santa Rosa, California) &quot;Ukraine belongs in NATO and the European Union. We need to have 1991 borders including Crimea. In addition, we need a lasting peace with security guarantees &#x2014; not useless agreements like the Budapest Memorandum or Minsk Accords.

I know that if Ukraine runs out of rockets, they&apos;ll use shells. If they run out of shells, they&apos;ll use bullets. &#xA0;If they run out of bullets, they&apos;ll use stones.

BREAKING: Zelensky 'not ready for peace,' Trump says after heated Oval Office clash	Editor&apos;s note: This story has been updated with the latest details. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 28, after meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House, that Zelensky &quot;is not ready for peace.&quot; &quot;He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for peace,&quot; Trump posted on Truth Social shortly after the meeting. Zelensky has since left the White House, according to Reuters. Trump said his meeting with Zelensky at the White House was meaningful and revealed things that &quot;could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure.&quot; He also claimed that Zelensky was &quot;not ready for peace if America is involved&quot; because he believed U.S. support gave him an advantage in negotiations. &quot;I don&apos;t want advantage, I want peace,&quot; Trump added. The two leaders held a 45-minute press briefing in the Oval Office, which ended in a heated exchange over American aid to Ukraine and the conditions of a potential peace deal with Russia. The dispute began when Zelensky responded to U.S. Vice President JD Vance&apos;s assertion that Ukraine must accept U.S.-proposed peace terms. As Zelensky attempted to make his case, Trump interrupted: &quot;You&apos;ve done a lot of talking.&quot; Zelensky pushed back, saying, &quot;From the start of the war, we were alone.&quot; Trump countered: &quot;If you didn&apos;t have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s visit was preceded by weeks of tense negotiations as Ukraine rejected the initial two draft proposals, presenting them as one-sided obligations for Ukraine without any security commitments on Washington&apos;s side. The long-debated agreement establishes a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the future monetization of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. Zelensky&apos;s reluctance to pen the initial draft, presented to him by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Kyiv on Feb. 12, prompted Trump to publicly lash out against the Ukrainian president. Last week, Trump denounced Ukraine&apos;s head of state as a &quot;dictator,&quot; accusing him of refusing to hold elections while echoing the Kremlin&apos;s false narratives about Zelensky&apos;s illegitimacy.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-not-ready-for-peace-trump-says-after-heated-oval-office-clash/	2025-02-28T10:42:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201830448.jpg

Trump says he's 'for both Ukraine and Russia' during meeting with Zelensky	U.S. President Donald Trump said he is &quot;for both Ukraine and Russia&quot; during a press conference with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House on Feb. 28. Talking about his role in negotiations to end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Trump said he was &quot;in the middle.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m for both Ukraine and Russia...

Ukraine's security guarantees are Europe's responsibility, Trump tells Zelensky	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 28 during a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington that security guarantees for Ukraine would be Europe&apos;s responsibility. Trump said he wants to finalize the peace deal between Ukraine and Russia first, emphasizing that security guarantees are only a minor part of the issue. &quot;I know that France is going to (provide guarantees), I know the U.K. is going to&#x2026; But we would have security in a different form.

BREAKING: Zelensky meets Trump in Washington to sign natural resources deal	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Feb. 28 as the two leaders are expected to sign a framework deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources.

As the U.S. and Ukrainian teams made progress on the deal, the final version of which was obtained by the Kyiv Independent, Trump softened his rhetoric, seemingly retracting his earlier statements. &quot;Did I say that? I can&apos;t believe I would say that,&quot; Trump said during a meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Feb. 27 when asked by a journalist whether he still considers Zelensky a &quot;dictator.&quot; While Ukrainian negotiators succeeded in pushing back on the toughest conditions set by the U.S. in the initial drafts, such as a demand for Kyiv to fill a $500 billion reconstruction fund and a 2:1 investment clause for Kyiv to double the aid given by the U.S., the current framework agreement still contains little in regard to security guarantees. Zelensky said that security commitments would be discussed in future rounds of talks with the U.S. and other partners, though Trump has already signaled he expects European partners to take responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s post-war security.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-trump-in-washington-to-conclude-natural-resources-deal/	2025-02-28T08:26:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-28-at-7_23_46-PM.jpeg
Belarus Weekly: Russia, Belarus confirm Zapad-2025 joint military drills in September	After 3 years of full-scale war, EU imposes sanctions on Belarus&apos; Integral micro-electronics producer for supplying Russia with microchips for its missiles. Russia, Belarus confirm they will hold Zapad-2025 joint military drills in September. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko extends the power of local authorities allowing them to approve heads of private companies. Belarusian journalist Ihar Ilyash goes on trial for &#x2018;extremist&#x2019; interviews. PEN International calls for the release of Belarusian-Polish journalist Andrzej Poczobut. The European Council imposed restrictions on Integral, a Belarusian micro-electronics producer supplying the Russian military, under the European Union&#x2019;s 16th sanctions package, which was adopted on Feb. 24 &#x2013; three years since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Belarus, a staunch ally of the Kremlin, has not sent its own troops to the battlefield, but allowed the Russian military to use its territory and infrastructure extensively when Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It has also helped Russia circumvent sanctions. The latest EU package imposes sanctions on JSC Integral, which makes semiconductors that were found as part of the wreckage of Russian missiles such as the R-37, Kh-59M2A, S-300, Kh-101, and Iskander, according to earlier media reports. JSC Integral cooperates with Russian defense sector firms Ulyanovsk Instrument Design Bureau and Radar MMS, and has received $350 million in investment from Russia.

(Thierry Monasse/Getty Images)Integral has increased its profits fortyfold since 2021, reporting $50 million in profits in 2023 &#x2013; despite being under U.S. sanctions. The new EU measures also block Belarusian citizens&#x2019; access to European crypto-asset platforms to prevent sanction circumvention. Belarusian nationals without valid European residence permits can no longer hold crypto-asset wallets, and are barred from managing positions in crypto-exchange platforms. Other provisions of the 16th sanction package for Belarus mirror trade restrictions already imposed by the EU on Russia. &#x201C;With talks underway to end Russia&#x2019;s aggression, we must put Ukraine in the strongest possible position, and sanctions provide leverage,&#x201D; said Kaja Kallas, the EU&#x2019;s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. The new sanction package, adopted on the third anniversary of the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, also targets the Russian shadow fleet of vessels used to circumvent the oil price cap mechanism, support Russia&#x2019;s energy sector, and transport military equipment or stolen Ukrainian grain. In addition, restrictions were imposed on 13 regional banks and 53 trade entities directly supporting the Russian defense sector as the Kremlin wages its war of aggression against Ukraine. The council also suspended broadcasting licenses for a range of Russia-controlled media outlets. Russia and Belarus will hold a major military exercise, titled Zapad-2025, in mid-September this year, Belarusian state-owned news agency Belta reported on Feb. 20, officially confirming the date for the first time. Military allies Russia and Belarus have been conducting the Zapad (&quot;West&quot; in Russian) strategic drills every two years since 2009. The exercises in 2025 were announced in October 2024, though no dates were given. Belarus will host 13,000 Russian troops during Zapad 2025, Belta reports, citing the head of the Department of International Military Cooperation of the Belarusian Defense Ministry, Valery Revenka. Revenka claimed that Belarus is &quot;developing its position&quot; regarding the invitations for OSCE member states to observe the drills, and also declared Belarus&apos;s readiness to conduct a mutual military inspection with Poland of the areas within 80 kilometers of their mutual border. The drills come amid growing concern over a potential buildup of Russian troops in Belarus in 2025. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed Russia plans to deploy 15 divisions, totaling 100,000 to 150,000 troops, primarily in Belarus in preparation for a major military escalation. However, the Lithuanian Armed Forces press office said on Feb. 25 that no redeployment of Russian forces has been detected so far. &#xA0; &quot;At the moment, military intelligence is monitoring Russia&apos;s actions in Ukraine, and there is no indication that forces are being redeployed closer to Lithuania,&#x201D; a statement from the Lithuanian Armed Forces reads. &#x201C;The situation in Belarus remains unchanged: intensive but stable military training,&quot; the statement says. The previous Zapad strategic exercises were held in 2021, and involved 200,000 Russian and Belarusian troops. The exercise was followed by another military drill, &quot;Union Resolve 2022,&quot; which was used to disguise the buildup of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border in late 2021 ahead of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Longtime Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko signed a decree on Feb. 21 granting district and city executive committee chairs the right to approve the heads of organizations operating in the territories they govern, including those under private ownership, Lukashenko&#x2019;s press office reported. Lukashenko first proposed allowing local authorities to govern privately owned companies in November 2024. His administration confirmed on Feb. 6 that a decree was in being drafted, targeting major employers while exempting small businesses. The decree foresees a wholesale expansion of the powers of local authorities. It will enter into effect on March 1. &#xA0; The decree stipulates that local executive committees are to draw up a list of firms operating under their jurisdiction, excluding organizations that are the sole owners of their property. The chairmen of local committees would then have a say in the appointment of the heads of organizations, deputy heads of organizations managing communal property in the area, and key specialists in agricultural organizations on the list. It remains unclear how local authorities will execute the decree. In 2024, payments from organizations accounted for 94.1% of all tax revenues in Belarus, with privately owned companies contributing 55.7%. Belarusian entrepreneur and economic analyst Aliaksandr Knyrovich sees the decree as an attempt by the government to control private enterprises, but described it as an unfeasible formality &#x2013; &#x201C;a monarchic whim that the villeins will try to pretend to fulfill.&#x201D; &#x201C;Two economies have been formed in Belarus: the one that creates value &#x2013; private business &#x2013; and the one that devours it,&#x201D; Knyrovich told the Kyiv Independent. The perceived grandeur of Belarus&#x2019;s state-run economy is an &#x201C;optical illusion,&#x201D; he said, adding that private firms are responsible for 52% of investment. The analyst said such attempts to control private businesses were due to the economic shortcomings in the Russian market of Lukashenko&#x2019;s state-run enterprises, and the administration&apos;s desire to stop the outflow of the workforce from the regions. According to Knyrovich, the government already has enough mechanisms to control private firms &#x2013; virtually non-stop inspections leading to fines or criminal cases. In dire scenarios, prison terms for the leadership are used as a pretext to nationalize an enterprise. However, the analyst said he does not expect the decree to lead to mass nationalization in Belarus. This is not the first non-market economic intervention by Lukashenko&#x2019;s government. In October 2022, on Lukashenko&#x2019;s orders, the government imposed sweeping price caps on consumer goods to stop rising prices. The restrictions have been slightly relaxed since then, but government control over consumer prices remains in place, artificially suppressing inflation that could otherwise reach 10-11% in 2024 instead of 5.5%, according to economists at BEROC &#x2013; the country&#x2019;s leading market economics think tank. Belarusian journalist and co-author of the book &#x201C;Belarusian Donbas,&#x201D; Ihar Ilyash, was put on trial on Feb. 21 on charges of discrediting Belarus and aiding &#x201C;extremist activities,&#x201D; the Viasna Human Rights Center has reported. Formerly a journalist for the Polish-funded satellite TV channel Belsat, Ilyash was detained in late October 2024 over interviews he gave to media that have been designated as extremists by Belarusian authorities. If found guilty, he faces up to three and five years of imprisonment. European and British diplomats, including representatives of Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, Slovakia, the Netherlands, and Sweden, gathered at the Minsk City Court building in a show of solidarity with the political prisoner. &#x201C;Today, we came to support Ihar Ilyash,&#x201D; the German Embassy said in a statement. &quot;There is a lawsuit against him because of his statements about the arrest of his wife, Katerina Bahvalova, for political reasons, and about Belarus&#x2019;s participation in Russia&#x2019;s illegal war of conquest against Ukraine. The right to freedom of speech and expression must be respected.&#x201D; Together with his wife, Belsat correspondent Katerina Bahvalova, Ilyash co-authored &#x201C;Belarusian Donbas,&#x201D; a book documenting Belarus&#x2019;s involvement in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine since 2014. Published in Kyiv in 2020, the book was slapped with an &#x201C;extremist&#x201D; label in Belarus in March 2021. Despite the threat of his arrest, Ilyash opted to stay in Belarus to support his wife. Bahvalova, detained in November 2020 as she was covering a protest rally in Minsk, was among the first Belarusian journalists jailed for their work. When she had almost served her term in full, she was charged with treason and sentenced to another eight years in prison. Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders says there are 39 journalists and five media workers among Belarus&#x2019;s 1,220 political prisoners. Around 35 independent media outlets and 33 individuals have been designated as extremists in Belarus, and 12 journalists have been included on the state list of &#x201C;terrorists,&#x201D; according to a Belarusian Association of Journalists report. Before Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Belarus was considered Europe&#x2019;s most dangerous country for journalists. Worldwide association of writers PEN International on Feb. 24 called for the release of Andrzej Poczobut, a Polish-Belarusian activist and correspondent for Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, who was sentenced to eight years in prison in Belarus in 2023 on charges of &#x201C;encouraging actions aimed at harming national security.&#x201D; PEN International, which advocates freedom of expression worldwide, claimed that Poczobut&#x2019;s case was emblematic of the type of oppression experienced by writers and journalists who speak up for the rights of oppressed minorities. &#x201C;Locked away, deprived of the very freedoms he seeks to protect, his persecution is a chilling reminder of the lengths to which the Belarusian authorities will go to crush dissent,&#x201D; Urtzi Urrutikoetxea, the Chair of the Translation and Linguistic Rights Committee of PEN International, said in a statement.

(Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Poland dismisses Poczobut&#x2019;s charges as politically motivated and has made his release one of three conditions for normalizing relations with Belarus. The rift between Poland and Belarus has grown over the past five years, particularly after the 2020 Belarusian election crisis, during which Poland supported the Belarusian opposition. Relations further soured due to Belarus&#x2019;s involvement in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine and its fomenting of a migration crisis on the borders of the European Union. The release of political prisoners has been the subject of recent discussions between the U.S. and Belarus, with the United States potentially providing sanctions relief in return for the release of those kept captive in Belarus on politically motivated charges, the New York Times reported last week. However, even as Belarus has been negotiating with Washington, and &#x201C;pardoning&#x201D; around 260 political prisoners in small batches in recent months, human rights organizations have said that at the same time even more individuals became political prisoners.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-russia-belarus-confirm-zapad-2025-joint-military-drills-in-september/	2025-02-28T08:06:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-3.28.40-AM.png
Weapons, cash seized as Romania targets far-right politician Georgescu's network, Reuters reports	Romanian prosecutors requested the temporary arrest of 21 individuals linked to far-right politician Calin Georgescu on Feb. 28, days after his detention, Reuters reported. During raids at multiple addresses linked to Georgescu and his associates, prosecutors seized a cache of weapons, including grenade launchers, as well as hidden cash. Georgescu, a pro-Russian politician who has called Ukraine a &quot;fictional state,&quot; won the first round of Romania&apos;s presidential election on Nov. 24. The country&apos;s Constitutional Court later nullified the results, citing &quot;organized manipulation from abroad.&quot; The Romania&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office has charged Georgescu with &quot;incitement to actions against the constitutional order&quot; and other offenses in a six-count indictment. Authorities say a broader investigation into election-related crimes uncovered links to an alleged illegal weapons network. Among the 21 individuals now facing arrest is former French Foreign Legion soldier Horatiu Potra, who served under contract in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. &quot;About the weapons, I will admit to illegal possession, but first I want to say that... rather than die legally, it is better to live illegally,&quot; Potra said, as quoted by Reuters. Romanian intelligence agencies have attributed Georgescu&apos;s unexpected electoral success to &quot;aggressive Russian hybrid attacks, including cyberattacks, information leaks, and sabotage.&quot; The country&apos;s foreign intelligence service (SIE) reported that a &quot;state actor&quot; had backed a sophisticated disinformation campaign to promote the far-right candidate. U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance criticized Romania&apos;s decision to annul the election results, calling it &quot;flimsy&quot; and politically motivated. Billionaire Elon Musk, an ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, also weighed in, denouncing Georgescu&apos;s detention in a post on X, the social media platform he owns. Bloomberg reported on Feb. 18 that the Trump administration has pressured the Romanian government to allow Georgescu&apos;s candidacy to proceed, despite intelligence pointing to Russian interference. If elected president, Georgescu has vowed to ban Ukrainian grain exports through Romania and halt military aid to Kyiv. The ongoing criminal case could prevent him from running in Romania&apos;s rescheduled presidential election, set for May 4.	https://kyivindependent.com/weapons-cash-seized-as-romania-targets-far-right-leader-georgescus-network-reuters-reports/	2025-02-28T08:05:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2186353250.jpg
How Ukrainians fund their own fight against Russia	While Ukraine heavily relies on foreign aid, the country&#x2019;s war effort is also funded by its own people. In 2024 alone, individual volunteers and fundraisers have raised nearly $1 billion to buy critical weapons and equipment for the Ukrainian military. But why do ordinary Ukrainians continue donating when international aid exists? And how has Ukraine&#x2019;s unique culture of giving become a lifeline for the country&#x2019;s survival?	https://kyivindependent.com/how-ukrainians-fund-their-own-fight-against-russia/	2025-02-28T07:29:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/telegram-cloud-document-2-5336824738788437908--1-.jpg
Orban opposes Ukraine's EU accession, claiming it would 'destroy' Hungary	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban reiterated his opposition to Ukraine&apos;s accession to the European Union on Feb. 28, warning that it would &quot;destroy&quot; Hungary, the country&apos;s public broadcaster Hirado reported. &quot;It will destroy us. First of all, it will destroy Hungarian farmers and Hungarian agriculture; secondly, it will destroy the entire Hungarian national economy, and I have no idea how we will control the crime that will flood into Hungary with this,&quot; Orban said. While he acknowledged that circumstances could change in the future, Orban insisted that Ukraine&apos;s accession was &quot;unthinkable&quot; under current conditions. Orban, widely seen as the EU&apos;s most pro-Russian leader, has repeatedly opposed military aid for Ukraine, arguing that Western support prolongs the war. He has maintained close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting him despite the full-scale invasion and amplifying Kremlin narratives in Europe. Hungary has used its veto power to stall key EU decisions on Ukraine, including military aid and accession talks. Budapest has also demanded the removal of eight individuals from the EU&apos;s Russia sanctions list and fresh guarantees on Ukraine&apos;s gas transit negotiations before agreeing to renew the restrictions, Reuters reported on Feb. 25. In previous negotiations, Hungary secured exemptions for Moscow Patriarch Kirill and the domestic use of Russian oil products. Kirill, a close ally of the Kremlin, has publicly endorsed Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, yet Budapest has blocked EU efforts to sanction him. Ukraine applied for EU membership in 2022 and achieved candidate status within months. Accession talks formally began in June 2024, with European leaders setting a 2030 target for Ukraine&apos;s potential entry. Unanimity among EU members is required for further progress, giving Hungary leverage to delay or block the process.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-eu-accession-would-destroy-hungary-orban-says-vows-opposition/	2025-02-28T07:18:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1697749423.jpg
Russia interested in lifting US sanctions against oligarchs, energy exports, Zelensky's adviser says	Lifting sanctions was one of Moscow&apos;s priorities during U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia earlier this month, Vladyslav Vlasiuk, the Ukrainian president&#x2019;s commissioner for sanctions, told journalists on Feb. 28. &quot;Our understanding is that they are most concerned about two things. The first thing is those oligarchs who are under U.S., EU and U.K. sanctions, because this is a real problem for them. And the second thing is what prevents Russia from making money &#x2014; energy (sanctions),&quot; he said. After the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on a number of oligarchs linked to the Kremlin. The Biden administration said that such a move would allow the seizure of yachts, money and other assets belonging to Russian oligarchs in U.S. jurisdiction. In early February, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that the U.S. Justice Department is shutting down a program that sanctioned Kremlin-linked oligarchs, launched in 2022. The Biden-era task force seized assets worth about $700 million as of February 2024. At the technical level, Kyiv continues to cooperate with Washington on further sanctions against Russia. Vlasiuk said that the U.S. has a &quot;good appetite&quot; for continuing work on sanctions against Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; a group of aging tankers routinely used for sanction evasion, as well as &quot;everything related to critical components.&quot; The European Union, the U.K., and the U.S. have slapped sanctions on oil-carrying vessels of Russia&apos;s so-called shadow fleet. Ukraine imposed sanctions on Russian &quot;shadow fleet&quot; captains, targeting Russian citizens and one Iranian national engaged in illicit oil exports through ship-to-ship transfers and other methods to bypass price caps. Drones and missiles used by Russia in its daily attacks on Ukraine contain tens of thousands of Western components, according to Ukrainian officials. Moscow continues to avoid sanctions through the use of sanctions evasion networks and shell companies and is also aided in sanctions evasion through its allies, including China, Iran, and North Korea. Washington is less eager for new individual and financial sanctions against Russia, Vlasiuk said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russi-most-interested-in-lifting-us-sanctions-on-oligarchs-energy-sources-zelenskys-adviser-says/	2025-02-28T07:12:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2037956454.jpg
Washington approves new Russian ambassador to US, Russian Foreign Ministry says	Russia has received U.S. approval to appoint Alexander Darchiev as its new ambassador to Washington, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced on Feb. 28. Darchiev&apos;s departure for his post in Washington is expected soon, the ministry said. Darchiev, a veteran diplomat with a half-decade of experience in Washington, previously served as Russia&apos;s ambassador to Canada from 2014 to 2021 and later as the director of the North American Department at the Russian Foreign Ministry. The approval comes amid renewed diplomatic engagement between the U.S. and Russia. A Russian delegation arrived at the U.S. Consul General&#x2019;s residence in Istanbul on Feb. 27 for a second round of talks, following an initial meeting in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. While the first meeting reportedly focused on Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine, the second round did not include discussions on the war, a U.S. State Department spokesperson confirmed. According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the Istanbul discussions centered on embassy operations. The previous Russian ambassador to the U.S., Anatoly Antonov, was dismissed from his post on Oct. 10, 2024. Under the U.S. President Joe Biden administration, the U.S. had largely severed official diplomatic contacts with Russia in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s return to office has shifted U.S. foreign policy. His administration engages more directly with Moscow while adopting a more critical stance toward Ukraine and its allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-approves-russias-new-ambassador-to-washington-as-talks-resume/	2025-02-28T06:52:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1813426206.jpg
Russia proposes resuming direct flights with US during talks in Turkey, Reuters reports	Russia has suggested resuming direct air travel with the United States during diplomatic talks in Istanbul, Reuters reported, citing the Russian Foreign Ministry. Direct flights between the two countries were suspended in 2022 due to Western sanctions over Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Russian Foreign Ministry has not disclosed the U.S. response to the proposal, but Reuters noted that the shares of Russia&apos;s largest airline, Aeroflot, rose 3.8% following the news. The Istanbul meeting between top U.S. and Russian officials lasted six hours and followed a phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 12, as well as a high-level meeting in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. Both countries claim they are seeking to end the Russian-Ukrainian war and explore major business opportunities, but they are first focusing on reestablishing basic diplomatic ties, Reuters wrote. &quot;The need for practical results aimed at creating conditions for improving bilateral relations in the interests of the peoples of our countries was particularly emphasized,&quot; the Russian Foreign Ministry said in its statement. According to the ministry, both sides agreed on steps to ensure the uninterrupted funding of embassies and allow diplomats to work normally after years of expulsions and retaliatory disputes. Russia also raised the issue of reclaiming six embassy properties in the United States that were confiscated between 2016 and 2018. The U.S. State Department&#x2019;s statement on Feb. 27 did not mention any discussion of air travel. Washington said the two sides had identified specific initial steps to &quot;stabilize&quot; the operations of diplomatic missions, including discussions on embassy staffing, visas, and diplomatic banking services with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-proposes-resuming-us-air-links-during-talks-in-turkey-reuters-reports/	2025-02-28T06:44:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-172750694--1-.jpeg
Klitschko announces dismissals of top Kyiv administration officials over corruption accusations	Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko announced on Feb. 28 that Petro Olenych, the deputy head of the Kyiv City Administration, and several other officials embroiled in a corruption probe would be dismissed. A day earlier, Ukraine&apos;s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&apos;s Office (SAPO) released recordings of conversations of Kyiv officials taken as part of a sting operation aimed at exposing functionaries involved in corruption in the city&apos;s land and budget sectors. Yurii Leonov, deputy director of the city&apos;s special housing fund, and Oleksii Mushta, deputy head of an urban infrastructure management agency, will also be dismissed. Kyiv City Council member and head of the land commission Mykhailo Terentiiev is also to resign, according to Klitschko&apos;s statement. &quot;There will be a reorganization in urban planning and land relations. And not only in these areas. As for the high-profile &apos;land case,&apos; the city provides law enforcement with all requested documents and facilitates the investigation,&quot; Klitschko said. The suspects reportedly found suitable land plots and registered ownership of buildings that never existed there in the name of controlled entities, according to the investigation. Subsequently, the applications for ownership for the maintenance of these structures were submitted to the city council, which allegedly helped them avoid a fair tender. On Feb. 7, the High Anti-Corruption Court imposed pre-trial restraints on the Kyiv officials suspected in the case. The court remanded Olenych in custody for two months, until April 6, with the possibility of posting Hr 15 million (nearly $360,000) bail. Olenych was released from the pre-trial detention center on bail on Feb. 21. Olenych said that his family had borrowed the money for bail and that he would file a motion for suspension from office during the investigation. On Feb. 10, NABU said the alleged head of the corruption scheme, former Kyiv City Council member Denys Komarnytskyi, was put on the wanted list in Ukraine. Ten people were charged in the case, seven of whom have been detained.	https://kyivindependent.com/klitschko-announces-several-dismissals-in-kyiv-city-administration-due-to-corruption-accusations/	2025-02-28T06:13:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1886723516.jpg
North Korea tests strategic cruise missiles as Kim orders nuclear readiness, state media reports	North Korea carried out a test launch of strategic cruise missiles to showcase its nuclear deterrence capabilities, the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported on Feb. 28. According to the KCNA, the missile exercise was conducted &quot;to inform the enemies seriously violating&quot; North Korea&apos;s security environment &quot;of the Korean People&apos;s Army counterattack capability in any space and the readiness of its various nuclear operation means.&quot; The test came as South Korea prepares for the &quot;Freedom Shield&quot; exercises with the U.S. in March. North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, who oversaw the launch, ordered the country&apos;s military to be in full nuclear strike readiness, calling it &quot;the most perfect deterrence.&quot; The strike was reportedly carried out on Feb. 26 west of the Korean peninsula, with the missile flying a trajectory of 1,587 kilometers (986 miles) for 133 minutes before hitting the targets. Tensions on the Korean peninsula are mounting amid North Korea&apos;s series of missile tests intended as a warning to its South Korean neighbors and the U.S. Kim has reportedly received technological assistance for his missile and nuclear programs from Russia in exchange for arms and soldiers provided for Moscow&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces, reportedly suffering significant losses. South Korea&apos;s military believes that Pyongyang could dispatch more than 1,000 additional troops to Russia this year.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-tests-missile-to-showcase-nuclear-readiness/	2025-02-28T05:24:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2152788663.jpg
Ukrainian forces destroy Russian thermobaric munitions depot in Donetsk Oblast, General Staff reports	Ukrainian forces destroyed a thermobaric munitions depot in Russian-occupied territory of Donetsk Oblast overnight on Feb. 28, the General Staff reported in a post on Telegram. The post was accompanied by a video of the strike near the town of Selydove in the embattled Pokrovsk district &#x2014; an initial explosion is followed by a spectacular series of much larger subsequent explosions in what appears to be the detonation of material on the ground. 0:00/1&#xD7;The General Staff described the target as a &quot;thermobaric ammunition storage facility of the Russian invaders.&quot; The results of the attacks are still being determined, according to the report. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Ukrainian forces also hit three other facilities in Russia, the General Staff said, including the Ilsky oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai &#x2014; the second time in February it has been hit. The previous attack, carried out by Ukraine on Feb. 17, caused a fire at the plant, which includes six oil refining units with a total capacity of 6.6 million tons per year, a source told the Kyiv Independent. Ukraine considers Russian oil facilities to be valid military targets, as fossil fuel profits supply Moscow&apos;s war machine. The Ukrainian military has launched repeated attacks against Russian refineries with long-range drones.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-forces-destroy-munitions-depot-in-russian-occupied-territory-of-donetsk-oblast-hit-oil-depot-in-russia/	2025-02-28T04:21:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-28-at-13_55_15.png
Russia reportedly attacking Sumy Oblast border; military hasn't confirmed	Russian infantry units are attempting to storm the Russia-Ukraine border in Sumy Oblast but are failing to achieve a breakthrough, claimed Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation, on Feb. 28. The official&apos;s comments come as the DeepState monitoring group marked the Ukrainian border village of Novenke as a contested area, suggesting that Russian forces crossed the border into Sumy Oblast. The northeastern region borders Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukrainian forces launched an incursion last summer to draw away Moscow&apos;s troops from Donbas and disrupt Russian plans for an offensive from the north. &quot;Currently, Russian forces are attempting to storm the border in infantry groups without vehicle columns,&quot; Kovalenko said on Telegram. &quot;There has been no breakthrough at the moment; the fighting continues.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Vadym Mysnyk, the spokesperson of the Operational Tactical Group Siversk, has declined to comment. Novenke, Sumy Oblast. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, the Russian military claimed. Russian casualties have reached nearly 40,000 in Kursk Oblast, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 6. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said last November that the incursion thwarted Russia&apos;s plans to invade Sumy Oblast in an attempt to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-reportedly-attacking-sumy-oblast-border-military-hasnt-confirmed/	2025-02-28T03:34:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167241364.jpg
Kyiv Independent’s film about military medics will be screened in 6 more European cities	The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s documentary about Ukrainian military medics who save lives on the front lines of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war will be screened in six more European cities in March 2025. &#x201C;Can You Hear Me? The Invisible Battles of Ukrainian Military Medics&#x201D; will be shown in Brussels, London, Strasbourg, Paris, Amsterdam and The Hague. All screenings will be followed by discussions with the film&#x2019;s authors, journalists Francis Farrell and Olena Zashko. The tour is organized in partnership with the Repower charitable organization that provides mental health retreats for Ukrainian medics. The film&#x2019;s authors followed a group of military medics as they journeyed from the heat of battle in war-torn Ukraine to the serene forests of Sweden for a short mental health retreat in the spring of 2024. Witnessing an endless conveyor belt of severe injuries and deaths since the beginning of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022 has taken a heavy toll on the medics&#x2019; mental health. Although crucial to address, the issue of their psychological well-being is rarely talked about and often overlooked, leaving them alone in this invisible battle. As they find themselves in a peaceful, quiet environment in Sweden for the first time since 2022, the medics have a chance to process the accumulated trauma, opening up about losing brothers-in-arms, surviving Russian captivity, and the inescapable feeling of guilt for not being able to save some of the soldiers they treated. The film premiered in December 2024 in Kyiv and was followed by a tour across nine European capitals. &quot;Since our last screening tour to Poland, Germany, and the Nordic and Baltic countries, it&apos;s fair to say a lot has happened. It is now more and more clear that the fate of Ukraine, and of Europe, is something that our neighbors on this continent, in the EU and NATO, will have to grasp and shape with their own hands, however scary that action may be. Given this, we believe it is all the more important that supporters, decision-makers, and ordinary people in Western Europe can watch our film and be reminded who the people defending the frontiers of freedom are, and why they and Ukraine need more bravery to end this war sooner with a just and secure peace,&quot; says Francis Farrell, a co-author of the film. &#x201C;When we showed our documentary in Europe in December, I realized something simple yet important. People in different countries who watched the film told me that they saw the real faces of this war &#x2014; people who were still fighting for their independence. Here in Ukraine, we see these people on our streets every day, but for the foreign audience, this isn&#x2019;t common,&#x201D; says Olena Zashko, a co-author of the film. &#x201C;When I told one of our main characters, Misha, that people in Europe say he is a hero, he was confused. He said, &#x2018;I am not a hero. Heroes are people who fight on the front line. I just save people&#x2019;s lives.&#x2019; This is exactly what our film is about &#x2014; ordinary people who are doing extraordinary things,&quot; she adds.

The Invisible Battles of Ukrainian Military Medics&#x201D; took more than nine months to produce, involving multiple trips to the front line in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, as well as a 10-day visit to Sweden. The retreat was organized by the Ukrainian-Swedish charitable organization Repower. Given unprecedented permission from the Ukrainian high command, Repower takes hand-picked groups of medics for mental health retreats in Sweden, Denmark, and Spain. Since the organization&#x2019;s founding in 2023, 847 military medics have participated in their program. &#x201C;At this defining moment in global history, Ukraine stands as the front line of Europe&#x2019;s values and security. As the U.S. turns away, the burden of leadership falls squarely on Europe&#x2019;s shoulders. The question is clear: Do we have the courage and conviction to uphold our fundamental responsibility &#x2014; to defend our shared values and ensure that no aggressor can invade a sovereign nation and walk away unchallenged?&#x201D; says Sebastian Lindstrom, a senior project coordinator at Repower. &#x201C;This screening tour brings the raw reality of war to the halls of power across Europe. Through the lens of the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s front-line journalists, we are forced to confront our moral compass. The combat medics, surgeons, and doctors who risk their lives daily to save others &#x2014; they embody the sacrifice and duty that must inspire our response. Their struggle demands more than words, it demands action.&#x201D; The film will be screened in Ukrainian with English subtitles (in France, with French subtitles).

Europe must finally take charge of its security — starting in Ukraine	It ended with a bang, not a whimper. By the close of this year&#x2019;s Munich Security Conference, the old U.S.-led security order appeared to have changed unrecognizably. Now, as Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war enters its fourth year and peace talks begin, without clarity on Europe&#x2019;s or Ukraine&#x2019;s roles, both should adjust to their new strategic reality. If it wants lasting peace on the continent, Europe must finally take responsibility for its own security &#x2013; starting in Ukraine. The outcome of peace talks (they are not negotiations until Ukraine is in the room) depends on battlefield expectations. Russia has little reason to keep its promises if it believes it has a fighting chance. Even after a settlement, Europe would remain permanently vulnerable to Russian aggression without credible deterrence. The best way to ensure lasting peace is to enable Ukraine to end the war on its own terms and keep the peace after it&#x2019;s won. Giving Ukraine the upper hand over Russia is less difficult than many expect. If Ukrainians have taught us anything, it&#x2019;s that Russia can be beaten. Even with support from North Korea and Iran, Russia hasn&#x2019;t yet managed to dislodge Ukrainians from Pokrovsk (in Ukraine) or Kursk Oblast (in Russia), and has been humiliated in Syria. All the while, it has suffered an estimated 850,000 casualties since its full-scale invasion. A combination of military fragility and economic decline means that time is not on Russia&#x2019;s side. Interest rates have soared to roughly 20% and inflation to 10%. Despite spending 30% of its budget on defense, Russia&#x2019;s artillery advantage (a good proxy for military production capacity) has reportedly fallen from 10:1 in 2022 to 1.5:1. The unsustainable loss of manpower and machinery, for only small battlefield gains, suggests Russia is stretched to near its breaking point.

(Eduard Kryzhanivskyi/Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)By comparison, the West is an economic behemoth. The combined GDP of countries that provided military aid to Ukraine was nearly $70 trillion in 2024, compared to roughly $2 trillion for Russia. Europe&#x2019;s NATO members alone have over 10 times Russia&#x2019;s GDP. However, despite its economic advantages, Russia has spent 40% more on destroying Ukraine than the combined West has spent defending it. The only way for Europe to ensure its relevance is by investing in its own security in Ukraine. This is not a trade-off in the name of solidarity. It is rational self-interest. That&#x2019;s because Ukraine is Europe: an investment in Ukraine&#x2019;s defense is an investment in Europe&#x2019;s defense. Emergency meetings in Paris last week suggested Europeans have received the message, though how much is &#x201C;enough&#x201D; is an open question. New research from the Tony Blair Institute suggests that an additional $40 billion per year &#x2014; just 0.2% of European GDP &#x2014; would likely match Russia&#x2019;s war spending and deliver Ukraine a battlefield advantage. This is no more expensive than other fiscal interventions, like those after the Global Financial Crisis and Covid-19. It&#x2019;s also far cheaper than the likely alternatives: a new Cold War, or even a hot war in Europe. To be sure, meaningful investment must be accompanied by ironclad, mutual security guarantees. But if wars are fought on the battlefield, they are won on the factory floor. Radically scaling up defense industrial capacity is crucial if Europe means to win. Ukraine can and should play a key role here: the country has mobilized its defense industry faster than any other in Europe. By following the Danish model of procuring equipment directly from Ukraine, for Ukrainians, Europe could achieve scale at lower cost while drawing on lessons from its most experienced military. All wars end. Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine will end too, but how it ends will determine whether it starts again. To ensure lasting peace, Europe must invest in its own security, and the best way is by defending Ukraine. It is vanishingly rare in world politics that right and wrong are so obvious. We should all find the courage to tell the difference.

Police raid Ukraine's 3 country's largest pharmaceutical plants, media reports	Ukraine&apos;s National Police is conducting searches at three of the country&apos;s major pharmaceutical plants, Ukrainska Pravda reported on Feb. 28, citing its sources. Earlier, the police announced that it was conducting investigations at four companies &quot;specializing in the production of medicine.&quot; The law enforcement agency did not disclose the names of the companies. In the morning on Feb. 28, the police searched the offices and production facilities of Arterium Corporation, Farmak Joint Stock Company, and Darnytsia Pharmaceutical Company, Ukrainska Pravda&apos;s source said. &quot;Searches are being conducted both at factories and in employees&apos; homes,&quot; the source said. The source added that the actions of law enforcement agencies resemble the case of Ukrainian businessman Ihor Mazepa, who was detained in early 2024. Mazepa&apos;s detention was related to his acquisition of land rights for the construction of the luxurious cottage resort Goodlife Park in the Vyshhorod district, Kyiv Oblast. The investment banker and his press service called his detention an unfounded attack against his business. According to the source, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) provides operational support during the raids. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 11 that prices in Ukrainian pharmacies are &quot;unacceptably high&quot; and announced a meeting of the National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) dedicated to the availability of medicines. Following the meeting, the NSDC approved steps to reduce drug prices in Ukraine. On Feb. 14, the Ukrainian government limited the pharmacy trade margin to no more than 35% for over-the-counter drugs and established a regressive scale for prescription drugs. According to the implemented changes, suppliers will be able to add no more than 8% to the wholesale price depending on the cost of the drug. On Feb. 19, the Health Ministry announced that prices for 100 of Ukraine&apos;s most popular medicines would be reduced by 30% starting March 1, 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-national-police-conduct-searches-at-3-countrys-largest-pharmaceutical-plants-media-reports/	2025-02-28T03:15:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/480478545_1065796045581561_845190653392661255_n.jpg
Europe is sitting on Russia's $198 billion. Giving it all to Ukraine is tricky	Europe has been left scrambling to find ways to boost defense spending and continue the flow of support to Ukraine after U.S. President Donald Trump made clear the continent won&apos;t be able to rely on Washington for its long-term security needs. The latest reports suggest that EU officials are considering loosening fiscal rules to free up at least 160 billion euros ($168 billion), which could be used to create a joint EU instrument for defense investment. But there is, potentially, an even bigger sum sitting right under their noses &#x2014; the $198 billion in Russian central bank reserves, currently frozen in Belgium. The EU, along with G7 countries, holds a total of more than $300 billion in frozen Russian assets. Interest from the frozen funds has been agreed to be used to cover the $50 billion loan pledged to Ukraine by the G7. However, some European countries are eager to use the funds more aggressively, offer more financial and military support to Ukraine, or fund the country&apos;s reconstruction. Yet figuring out exactly how this can be done, or if it should be done, still divides the continent. One option would be to continue using the profits generated by the assets to support Ukraine&apos;s war effort, a move that at one point was unprecedented. &quot;It was the first time in history that we faced this situation,&quot; an EU official told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity. &quot;Having a huge amount, (nearly) $200 billion, of Russian immobilized assets in Belgium &#x2014; there was no legal text, no jurisprudence, no precedent.&quot; Belgian and European lawyers worked to figure out if the profits generated by the assets could be seized and given to Ukraine. It took months, but they found a way. &quot;It&apos;s already quite something that we are using Russian money for Ukraine to buy weapons,&quot; the official added. Since July 2024, profits from these assets have already been used by the European Commission and G7 countries to give Ukraine around $4.7 billion in support so far. Crucially, the legality of this move has not been successfully challenged. While the sums generated by these profits are a fraction of the total amount of frozen assets, this method provides Ukraine with reliable and consistent funds. What&apos;s more, this has broad support from EU member states and G7 countries, which can&apos;t be said of the other ways in which Russia&apos;s assets might be used. EU nations could also seize the entirety of Russia&apos;s assets across Europe and redirect the money to Ukraine or shore up their own spending. It would be a dramatic move and hugely consequential for Ukraine. Though the chances of it happening are slim, it does have some support. &quot;Estonia has been pushing for seizing Russia&apos;s immobilized state assets for the benefit of Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale war,&quot; the country&apos;s Foreign Minister, Margus Tsahkna, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The decision to use the windfall profits was a step in the right direction. I see that the time is ripe now to take the next step. The EU must start a serious discussion that would lead to the decision to mobilize the bulk of Russia&apos;s sovereign assets.&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk also expressed his support for the idea in a post on X on Feb. 20. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk during his meeting with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in Warsaw, Poland on April 23, 2024. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)&quot;Enough talking, it&apos;s time to act! Let&apos;s finance our aid for Ukraine from the Russian frozen assets,&quot; he said. Despite these calls, it almost certainly won&apos;t happen. &quot;It is very clear that legally you cannot do it,&quot; an EU official told the Kyiv Independent, adding: &quot;Every financial institution, the European Central Bank, the European Commission, will tell you that.&quot; While the move would be legally dubious, some suggest it could also be strategically reckless. &quot;If we decide to take that step, we are playing Russia&apos;s game,&quot; the EU official said. &quot;We risk neglecting the international laws and rules that we have established to turn them into our advantage. I can imagine that in Ukraine especially, it can be very frustrating to see all that money sitting in Europe that cannot be seized. &quot;But we really need to resist the temptation because otherwise, we&apos;re turning our backs on the very principles and values that we are all fighting for, that Ukraine is fighting for most of all.&quot; French President Emmanuel Macron has also expressed skepticism. Sat next to Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 24, the French leader said Russia&apos;s assets &quot;are not our belongings, so they are frozen.&quot; implying that a full seizure would be unacceptable. Belgium, where the assets are currently frozen, has also opposed a full seizure because of what it sees as shaky legal justification, and a weakening of Ukraine&apos;s hand in future peace negotiations.

(Sarah Meyssonnier/Pool/AFP via Getty Images)&quot;Whenever peace negotiations take place, having these frozen assets will be massive leverage for Ukraine,&quot; the EU diplomat said. &quot;If we spend them now, Ukraine will be at the negotiating table with less leverage than it could have had. Our hope is that Russia will have to compensate Ukraine and repay Ukraine for all the atrocities committed and all the destruction.&quot; A newer option being considered by European leaders is to hold Russia&apos;s billions as collateral to ensure Moscow pays compensation to Ukraine if and when a peace deal is agreed. Negotiations on exactly how this might work are ongoing among European leaders, and the timeline for when this might happen remains unclear, but experts say it can be done legally. Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric Dopagne, professor of Public International Law at Belgian UCLouvain University, told the Kyiv Independent that Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine constitutes a &quot;serious violation of a fundamental rule of international law, the prohibition of aggression.&quot; &quot;All states are entitled to take countermeasures to ensure the cessation of the violation and reparation of damages in the interest of Ukraine,&quot; he added. Dopagne says that although there is limited precedent for this, he sees no major impediment to such a move under international law, adding that &quot;Russia itself has engaged in such patterns of unilateral confiscations of foreign sovereign property for war damages in recent years.&quot; This means that should Russia fail to pay sufficient damages to Ukraine for the death and destruction caused by the full-scale invasion, European nations could seize the frozen billions to make up for any shortfall.

(Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)This option will, however, be down to political will in Europe, and for now, the EU&apos;s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, says there is no path to a deal on this. Baltic and Nordic countries, as well as Poland could support the move, but a number of other European countries still haven&apos;t taken a clear stance. Crucially, Belgian officials told the Kyiv Independent that they don&apos;t rule out the idea of using Russian assets as collateral in a post-peace compensation deal. However, they would need to be certain that any deal is legally watertight. Other EU countries will almost certainly want similar assurances, a process which could take months. Of all the potential options, diplomats and legal experts behind the scenes say this could be the most viable, but exactly when it could be put into practice remains unclear. European leaders have shown a willingness to explore ways of using Russia&apos;s frozen billions to help Ukraine, and continue to use the profits they generate to fund Kyiv&apos;s war effort in the meantime. The options available to them, however, have either been dismissed outright, or mean wading through uncharted legal waters and complex political wranglings. A determinant factor will be the negotiations between Russia and the U.S. on how to end Moscow&apos;s war of aggression in Ukraine &#x2014; negotiations in which Washington has been reluctant to include its Ukrainian and European allies. Whatever the outcome of those negotiations and decisions made in European capitals, using more of Russia&apos;s assets in support of Ukraine, if it happens at all, will almost certainly take months.	https://kyivindependent.com/can-europe-give-russias-frozen-billions-to-ukraine/	2025-02-28T02:34:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200258505.jpg
Starmer invites Zelensky, other leaders to summit on Ukraine, security on March 2	U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer invited over a dozen European leaders, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, to a summit on Ukraine and security on March 2 in London, AFP reported on Feb. 28, citing Starmer&apos;s office. The news comes as Starmer met U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House the day earlier to discuss the Western allies&apos; role in securing a lasting peace in Ukraine. Among those invited to the summit are leaders of France, Germany, Denmark, Italy, and Turkey. Following Starmer&apos;s meeting with Trump, the leaders of the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Finland, Sweden, Czechia, and Romania were added to the list of invitees. NATO chief Mark Rutte and EU leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa are also expected to join. &quot;The prime minister will use the summit to drive forward European action on Ukraine &#x2013; signaling our collective unwavering support to securing a just and enduring peace, and a lasting deal, that ensures Ukraine&apos;s future sovereignty and security,&quot; his office said. Before the summit, Starmer will have a call with representatives of the Baltic states in the morning, after which he will meet with Zelensky in Downing Street to discuss the war against Russia, according to the office. Prior to the summit, Starmer will hold one-on-one talks with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. During the meeting, they will focus on &quot;strengthening Ukraine&apos;s position now &#x2014; including ongoing military support and increased economic pressure on Russia,&quot; AFP reported. Trump has been pushing Ukraine and Russia to quickly negotiate a ceasefire, though no formal peace talks involving both Kyiv and Moscow have taken place. U.S. officials have held direct talks with Russian delegates in recent days, without Ukraine&apos;s participation. The U.S. has also reached an agreement on critical mineral revenues with Ukraine that President Volodymyr Zelensky will sign during a visit to the White House on Feb. 28.	https://kyivindependent.com/starmer-invites-over-dozen-european-leaders-to-summit-on-ukraine-security-on-march-2-in-london/	2025-02-28T02:26:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184127273.jpg
Europe cannot be vassal of US, Macron says amid Trump's foreign policy shifts	French President Emmanuel Macron called upon Europe to &quot;rediscover taste for risk, ambition, and power&quot; and reject dependence on the U.S., the French news channel BFM TV reported on Feb. 28. The comments come amid seismic geopolitical shifts as U.S. President Donald Trump upends Washington&apos;s long-standing policy on Ukraine and Russia while casting doubt on his commitments to transatlantic security. Speaking during his two-day visit to Portugal, Macron said that Europe must be &quot;more united and stronger than ever&quot; and take decisive steps in &quot;technological, industrial, (and) defense matters.&quot; &quot;I see a lot of people in Europe saying, &apos;we&apos;ll have to be nice to the Americans, it&apos;ll pass, we have to bend our backs,&apos;&quot; Macron said in comments quoted by BFM TV. But &quot;submission is not an answer,&quot; the French president added, warning Europe against entering into a &quot;happy vassalage.&quot; The statement follows discussions within Europe on boosting defense spending to strengthen its own capabilities and Ukraine&apos;s. Macron&apos;s trip to Portugal came after he visited Washington, where he sought to convince Trump to commit to post-war security guarantees for Ukraine. The French president has reportedly failed to receive any clear commitments from Trump, with an undisclosed EU official describing the trip as a &quot;waste of time&quot; in comments for Politico. While made in an unprecedented geopolitical context, Macron&apos;s views on Europe&apos;s autonomy are not new. He has long called on Europe to forge its strategic independence and cast off reliance on the U.S. As the continued U.S. support for Ukraine against Russian aggression grows uncertain, Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who visited Trump shortly after the French president, have spearheaded a plan to deploy European peacekeepers in the country to monitor a potential ceasefire. Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to discuss the U.S.&apos;s possible security guarantees with Trump during his visit to Washington on Feb. 28. The two leaders are also expected to sign a framework agreement on Ukrainian minerals and other resources.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-cannot-be-vassal-of-us-macron-says/	2025-02-28T01:49:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201589115.jpg
Ireland open to sending peacekeepers to Ukraine, PM says	Ireland is open to sending peacekeepers to Ukraine to monitor a potential ceasefire, Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin told President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Irish Examiner newspaper reported on Feb. 27. Zelensky&apos;s visit to Ireland came before his planned talks with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Feb. 28, where he is expected to sign a natural resources agreement with the U.S. While Ireland maintains a policy of military neutrality and is not a NATO member, Dublin has provided over 380 million euros ($420 million) in humanitarian, economic, and non-lethal defense support to Ukraine. The concept of a multinational peacekeeping force, spearheaded by the U.K. and France, has been floated as a potential security guarantee for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. Apart from Ireland, Switzerland and Turkey are also reportedly considering sending their troops to Ukraine. Russia opposed NATO peacekeepers in Ukraine, but Ireland and Switzerland are not members of the alliance, while Turkey maintains good bilateral relations with Moscow. Previously, Zelensky said that European partners would need to station 100,000 to 150,000 soldiers in Ukraine to effectively deter Russia. The U.S. has ruled out sending its own troops while encouraging European allies to take the lead in securing Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability. The U.K. and France are considering deploying a much smaller European-led peacekeeping force with up to 30,000 soldiers, the Telegraph reported. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Feb. 27 that London is ready &quot;to put boots on the ground, planes in the air&quot; to back a peace deal for Ukraine. Apart from the U.K. and France, other countries remain cautious about sending their troops to Ukraine, citing concerns over the escalation and limited military resources, according to the Washington Post.	https://kyivindependent.com/ireland-open-to-sending-peacekeepers-to-ukraine-mp-says/	2025-02-28T01:01:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1241839072.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 3, injure 20 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed three people and injured 20 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Feb. 28. Ukrainian forces downed 107 out of the 208 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Ninety-seven drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are usually decoys. Russia launches them alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense. A Russian drone strike on the city of Zaporizhzhia damaged three high-rise buildings and five houses, according to Governor Ivan Fedorov. Three apartments were destroyed by fire. The attack injured an 82-year-old woman, the governor said. The aftermath of a Russian attack on the city of Zaporizhzhia overnight on Feb. 28, 2025. (State Emergency Service)Three people were killed in the cities of Pokrovsk and Kostiantynivka as well as in the village of Torske in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Seven more people were injured in the region over the past day. A Russian drone attack on the city of Balakliia in Kharkiv Oblast destroyed an apartment building, injuring two men and a woman, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Russian drones also targeted residential areas, an enterprise, and a power grid facility near Kharkiv overnight, damaging around 20 residential buildings. A woman and a man suffered injuries, according to the governor. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 36 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Seven people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-three/	2025-02-27T23:46:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-28_00-44-17.jpg
Initial steps' identified — US comments on Istanbul talks with Russia about embassy operations	U.S.-Russia talks in Istanbul on Feb. 27 were &quot;constructive&quot; and helped identify &quot;initial steps to stabilize bilateral mission operations,&quot; the U.S. State Department said. The already second round of high-level talks between Russia and the Trump administration was focused on embassy operations and came amid Washington&apos;s intensifying diplomatic outreach to Moscow. The deliberations allegedly did not concern a potential peace deal in Ukraine. &quot;The United States raised concerns regarding access to banking and contracted services as well as the need to ensure stable and sustainable staffing levels at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow,&quot; the State Department said in a statement. The Russian delegation was led by Foreign Ministry Atlantic Department Director Ambassador Alexander Darchiyev, while the U.S. side was headed by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Sonata Coulter. The discussions, held at the U.S. Consul General&apos;s residence in Istanbul, concluded after more than six hours without comments for the press. Moscow hopes that the &quot;expert consultation&quot; was the first of many and would help Russia and the U.S. in &quot;overcoming disagreements and strengthening trust,&quot; Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said. The meeting came as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to broker a swift peace deal to end Russia&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine, which recently entered its fourth year. An exclusion of Ukraine and other partners from the initial U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 sparked fears that Trump might sideline Kyiv and Europe in the peace process. Upending former President Joe Biden&apos;s policy on Ukraine and Russia, the Trump administration has adopted a more hostile rhetoric toward Kyiv while refusing to name Russia as the aggressor, claiming that such labels undermine peace efforts. Russian President Vladimir Putin praised the Trump administration for its supposed &quot;pragmatism,&quot; saying that Moscow and Washington are ready to restart cooperation as first contacts &quot;inspire certain hopes.&quot; The U.S. has been Ukraine&apos;s key ally during the full-scale war, providing around $100 billion in military and economic support. Trump&apos;s foreign policy shift has raised doubt about his continued commitment to Ukraine&apos;s resistance and the security of the European continent.	https://kyivindependent.com/initial-steps-identified-us-comments-on-russia-talks/	2025-02-27T23:37:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-859334850.jpg
UK ready 'to put boots on the ground, planes in the air' to back Ukraine peace deal, Starmer says	London is ready to send its troops to Ukraine to secure a &quot;good deal&quot; on ending Russia&apos;s full-scale war, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said at a press conference with U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House on Feb. 27. The two leaders met earlier in the day for talks that focused heavily on the Western allies&apos; role in securing a lasting peace in Ukraine. The U.K. prime minister&apos;s visit took place a day before President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s trip to Washington, where he is expected to sign a minerals agreement with the U.S. According to Starmer, he and Trump discussed a plan to reach a just peace &quot;that Ukraine will help shape,&quot; and that is &quot;backed by strength to stop (Russian President Vladimir) Putin (from) coming back for more.&quot; &quot;We agree history must be on the side of the peacemaker, not the invader,&quot; Starmer said. &quot;I&apos;m working closely with other European leaders on this, and I&apos;m clear that the U.K. is ready to put boots on the ground and planes in the air to support a deal, working together with our allies, because that is the only way that peace will last,&quot; he added. Previously, Zelensky said that European partners would need to station 100,000 to 150,000 soldiers in Ukraine to effectively deter Russia. The U.S. has ruled out sending its own troops while encouraging European allies to take the lead in securing Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability.

US-Ukraine natural resources deal ready for signing, treasury secretary says	The framework agreement between Washington and Kyiv on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources has been finalized and will be signed by the two countries&apos; heads of state on Feb. 28, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Fox Business. The long-debated agreement establishes a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the future monetization of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose plane reportedly landed in the U.S. earlier on Feb. 28, is expected to discuss the deal and possibly sign the framework agreement during a meeting with his U.S. counterpart, Donald Trump. &quot;Their (Ukrainian) governing council approved the deal last night. So, I have an agreement from their economy minister (Yuliia Svyrydenko). The deal is done,&quot; Bessent said in an interview with Fox Business on Feb. 27. &quot;President Zelensky is coming to sign the deal tomorrow... I&apos;m sure President Zelensky and President Trump will have a wide-ranging discussion. But as far as the deal, it is complete, it is on paper.&quot; Bessent clarified that the agreement concerns Ukraine&apos;s strategic minerals, oil, gas, and infrastructure assets, calling it a &quot;win-win&quot; as it &quot;brings the Ukrainian people and the American business community together.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s reluctance to pen the deal prompted Trump to lash out against the Ukrainian president publicly, denouncing him as a &quot;dictator&quot; and accusing him of refusing to hold elections while echoing the Kremlin&apos;s false narratives about Zelensky&apos;s illegitimacy. As the U.S. and Ukrainian teams made progress on the deal, the final version of which was obtained by the Kyiv Independent, Trump softened his rhetoric, seemingly retracting his earlier statements. &quot;Did I say that? I can&apos;t believe I would say that,&quot; Trump said during a meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer when asked by a journalist whether he still considers Zelensky a &quot;dictator.&quot; While Ukrainian negotiators succeeded in pushing back on the toughest conditions set by the U.S. in the initial drafts, such as a demand for Kyiv to fill a $500 billion reconstruction fund and a 2:1 investment clause for Kyiv to double the aid given by the U.S., the current framework agreement still contains little regarding security guarantees. Zelensky said that security commitments would be discussed in future rounds of talks with the U.S. and other partners, though Trump has already signaled he expects European partners to take responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-ukraine-natural-resources-deal-ready-for-signing-treasury-secretary-says/	2025-02-27T22:48:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201520583.jpg

Ukrainian activist, soldier Vasyl Ratushnyi killed on front lines	Vasyl Ratushnyi, an activist and drone pilot in Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, died while fighting on the front lines on Feb. 27, according to his family. Ratushnyi was the son of the writer Svitlana Povalyaeva and the brother of the prominent activist Roman Ratushnyi, who died in combat in 2022. Ratushnyi, a member of Ukraine&apos;s Birds of Magyar drone unit, was killed in a direct attack by a first-person-view (FPV) drone during an overnight combat mission, Povalyaeva said in a Facebook post. &quot;My eldest son, my life,&quot; she wrote. Previously, Ratushnyi participated in Ukraine&apos;s EuroMaidan Revolution, alongside his younger brother, renowned activist Roman Ratushnyi. Roman was killed while fighting near Izium in Kharkiv Oblast in June 2022. Following EuroMaidan and Russia&apos;s subsequent invasion of Donbas, Vasyl, then 18, volunteered to fight on the front lines in eastern Ukraine. Following Roman&apos;s death in 2022, Vasyl said he carried with him military gear that his brother left him in his will. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-activist-soldier-vasyl-ratushnyi-killed-on-front-lines/	2025-02-27T22:01:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/vasyl2.jpeg
Don't 'give Russia what they want' — Kallas decries taking NATO membership off the table for Ukraine	EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas decried ruling out NATO membership for Ukraine in an interview with AFP published on Feb. 27. To the dismay of Ukraine and its allies in Europe, U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly ruled out NATO membership for Ukraine as a security guarantee against future Russian aggression. Kallas told AFP during a visit to Washington that there was no reason to offer concessions to Russia before formal peace negotiations even begin, especially given their ongoing occupation of Ukraine. &quot;My question is, why we should give Russia what they want on top of what they have already done &#x2014; attacking Ukraine, annexing territory, occupying territory, and now offering something on top of it?&quot; Kallas likened the proposed concessions to attempts to appease Al Qaeda following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks against the U.S.. &quot;Consider here in America that after 9/11 you would have sat down with Osama bin Laden and said, &apos;OK, what else do you want?&apos; I mean, it&apos;s unimaginable,&quot; she said. Russia has long advocated against NATO membership for Ukraine and alleged that Ukraine&apos;s desire to join the alliance provoked the full-scale invasion &#x2014;&#xA0;a justification Trump has repeated. Kallas called these claims &quot;totally untrue.&quot; &quot;That is the Russian narrative that we should not buy,&quot; she said. Kallas, the former prime minister of Estonia, said the Baltic country joined NATO because it is &quot;afraid of Russia,&quot; with which it shares a border. &quot;And the only thing that really works &#x2014; the only security guarantee that works &#x2014; is NATO&apos;s umbrella,&quot; she said. Europe won&apos;t be able to assist Ukraine in an eventual peace deal if the White House does not include European nations in the process, the official added. Kallas has voiced strong support for Ukraine&apos;s defense and urged Western partners to maintain a robust alliance against Russian aggression.On Feb. 18 Kallas said &quot;Russia will try to divide us,&quot; Kallas said on Feb. 18 following the U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia. &quot;Let&apos;s not walk into their traps. By working together with the U.S., we can achieve a just and lasting peace &#x2014; on Ukraine&apos;s terms.&quot; Amid the shift in U.S. foreign policy, European NATO allies are preparing to send more military aid to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/kallas-decries-taking-nato-membership-off-the-table-for-ukraine/	2025-02-27T21:24:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2160829296.jpg
Trump eyeing Russian minerals after war ends, US official says	The U.S. is open to a minerals deal with Russia, Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s envoy to the Middle East, said in an interview with Fox News on Feb. 27. Witkoff&apos;s remarks come as President Volodymyr Zelensky prepares to sign a critical minerals agreement between Ukraine and the U.S. on Feb. 28. In addition to Ukraine&apos;s mineral resources, the U.S. is interested in exploring Russia&apos;s significant mineral deposits once a peace agreement is reached, Witkoff said. &quot;I think there will be plenty of opportunities for the United States with Russia when this peace deal gets finished,&quot; Witkoff said. Witkoff said he believed there would be &quot;be plenty of economic cooperation opportunities&quot; between the U.S. and Russia once the war ends. Earlier this week, Trump said he was open to striking a deal on critical minerals with Russia, though he denied having spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin about accessing minerals in Russian-occupied Ukrainian lands. &quot;I&apos;d like to buy minerals on Russian land too if we can,&quot; Trump said. &quot;The rare earth, they have very good rare earth ... It&apos;s great for Russia too, because we could do deals there.&quot; Putin said on Feb. 24 that Moscow was open to working with foreign partners on developing rare earth metal deposits, including in occupied regions of Ukraine. In a significant foreign policy shift for the U.S., the Trump administration has been looking to increase cooperation with Russia despite the deterioration of relations between the two countries in recent years. While he is officially Trump&apos;s Middle East envoy, Witkoff has emerged as a key figure in the evolving negotiations between the U.S. and Russia. Witkoff traveled to Moscow earlier in February for the release of imprisoned U.S. teacher Marc Fogel, meeting personally with Putin during his visit. Witkoff also participated in the U.S.-Russia talks in Saudia Arabia on &#xA0;Feb. 18. No Ukrainian officials were present at the Riyadh negotiations. Some experts have suggested that Witkoff&apos;s increased role reflects Russia&apos;s belief that Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, holds stronger pro-Ukrainian views. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-administration-considering-russian-minerals-us-official-says/	2025-02-27T20:08:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2195072233.jpg
Turkish imports of Russian oil drop nearly fourfold after new sanctions	Turkish imports of Russian oil have quietly plummeted since harsher sanctions were imposed earlier this year, the Moscow Times reported on Feb. 27. The U.S. and U.K. passed sweeping sanctions against Russia&apos;s oil sector on Jan. 10, particularly targeting Moscow&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of tankers. Shipments of Russian Urals, the country&apos;s flagship crude oil, have dropped to a low not seen since December 2022. Turkish imports of Russian Urals fell to 0.24 million tons in February, down from 1.56 million tons in January, the Moscow Times reported. Turkey&apos;s top refiner, Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri (Tupras), has stopped accepting shipments of Russian crude, demanding that they comply with the $60 per barrel G7 price cap, Reuters Reuters reported earler this month. The change in policy began after the Jan. 10 sanctions. The drop in Turkish demand for Russian oil has impacted operations at Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegaz, major Russian oil and gas companies, and has affected over 180 tankers of the so-called &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; a large group of vessels Russia uses to circumvent Western sanctions. Amid sanctions on Russian oil, Turkey has sought to import from other producers. Turkish imports of oil from Africa reached a five-year high in February. Turkish imports of Nigerian Forcados Blend oil reached 0.26 million tons in February, the highest amount the nation has purchased from Nigeria since 2020. The country imported 0.36 million tons of Libyan Es Sider and Amna grade oil in February compared to only 80,000 tons in January &#x2014; a fourfold increase. Turkey has been long singled out as one of the main facilitators of circumventing sanctions imposed on Russia by the West over the invasion of Ukraine. In November 2024, the European Union&apos;s anti-fraud agency opened an investigation into the possible exporting of rebranded Russian oil via Turkey into the EU. Turkey, a member of NATO, has been pursuing a standalone Russia policy since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began, retaining a mediator role between Russia, Ukraine, and the West. Russian and U.S. officials held talks in Istanbul on Feb. 27, their second round of direct discussions this month. Ukraine was not a topic of the discussion, the U.S. State Department said.	https://kyivindependent.com/turkish-imports-of-russian-oil-drop-nearly-fourfold-amid-sanctions/	2025-02-27T18:30:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/taneco.jpg
If it doesn't happen quickly, it may not happen at all' — Trump on peace in Ukraine	A peace deal to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine will happen &quot;quickly&quot; or not at all, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 27 during a joint press conference with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The two leaders met earlier in the day for talks that focused heavily on Western allies&apos; role in securing a lasting peace in Ukraine. Trump said that steps towards a peace deal were &quot;moving along pretty rapidly&quot; and that he expected an agreement to be negotiated &quot;fairly soon,&quot; or not at all. &quot;If it doesn&apos;t happen quickly, it may not happen at all,&quot; he said. Trump has been pushing Ukraine and Russia to quickly negotiate a ceasefire, though no formal peace talks involving both Kyiv and Moscow have taken place. U.S. officials have held direct talks with Russian delegates in recent days, without Ukraine&apos;s participation. The U.S. has also reached an agreement on critical mineral revenues with Ukraine that President Volodymyr Zelensky will sign during a visit to the White House on Feb. 28. The minerals deal does not include ongoing security guarantees for Ukraine. Starmer has pressed Trump to pledge U.S. backing for a European-led peacekeeping force that would deter future Russian aggression in Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. No committments were announced following the meeting, though Starmer said he had &quot;a very productive discussion&quot; with Trump. &quot;The deal has to come first,&quot; Starmer said, adding that their respective teams would continue to talk about ways to make sure a future ceasefire holds. Starmer reiterated the U.K.&apos;s support for Ukraine and its plans to send record amounts of military aid to Kyiv this year. He insisted that a peace deal must be &quot;backed by strength&quot; and fair to Ukraine. &quot;It can&apos;t be peace that rewards the aggressor .... history must be on the side of the peacemaker, not the invader,&quot; he said. The U.S. and U.K. are discussing a peace deal that would be &quot;tough and fair&quot; and shaped directly by Ukraine, Starmer said. Starmer&apos;s visit to Washington comes shortly after French President Emmanuel Macron met with Trump at the White House to discuss European security interests and U.S. support for Ukraine. Starmer and Macron have championed a plan to deploy European peacekeeprs to Ukraine to monitor a ceasefire. The Kremlin has said it would not accept European troops in Ukraine as a condition of a peace agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/if-it-doesnt-happen-quickly-it-may-not-happen-at-all-trump-on-peace-in-ukraine/	2025-02-27T17:18:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201663269.jpg
EU leaders to discuss special envoy for Ukraine peace talks, Bloomberg reports	European Union leaders will consider appointing a special envoy for potential negotiations to end Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine during a meeting next week, sources familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg. The proposal follows growing concerns that the EU has been sidelined from early talks involving the United States and Russia. The discussion gained urgency after Washington engaged in direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, excluding both Ukraine and Europe from the conversation. In mid-February, U.S. and Russian officials held a first round of talks in Saudi Arabia without European or Ukrainian participation. Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s envoy for Ukraine and Russia, has been meeting with European officials and reportedly indicated at the Munich Security Conference that the EU is unlikely to have a role in the negotiations. Ukrainian officials have urged the EU to move quickly in naming a representative for potential peace discussions. European leaders are expected to use the March 6 summit to define a unified stance on defense and security guarantees for Ukraine, according to sources who requested anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the issue. The summit will also serve as a platform to outline the EU&#x2019;s broader vision for Ukraine&#x2019;s future security and potential post-war settlement. Leaders will discuss what peace terms should look like and what commitments the bloc is willing to make to support Kyiv in any negotiations with Moscow and Washington. Additionally, the European Commission is set to present a plan to boost the continent&#x2019;s defense industry with an injection of hundreds of billions of euros. The commission is also expected to propose measures allowing more flexible defense spending while ensuring compliance with EU fiscal rules, according to the sources.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-leaders-to-discuss-special-envoy-for-ukraine-peace-talks/	2025-02-27T15:41:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158001247.jpg
EBRD lowers Ukraine’s 2025 growth forecast amid inflation, war impact	The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has lowered its 2025 growth forecast for Ukraine&#x2019;s economy, now expecting 3.5% growth instead of the previously projected 4.7%, the bank announced in a press release on Feb. 27. The downgrade comes as inflation accelerates due to the ongoing war. In December 2024, inflation reached 12%, driven by rising electricity costs, utility price hikes, wage increases, and the weakening hryvnia against the U.S. dollar. According to the EBRD, Russian attacks on Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure and severe labor shortages have slowed economic growth from 5% to just 2% in late 2024. &#x201C;The continuation of the war and massive attacks by Russia on Ukraine&#x2019;s electricity infrastructure have caused both power shortages&#x2014;forcing Ukrainians to pay high prices for imported electricity&#x2014;and acute labor shortages,&#x201D; the EBRD wrote. Despite these challenges, Ukraine&#x2019;s economy still grew by 3% in 2024. The EBRD predicts growth could reach 5% in 2026, but only if the war ends this year. To curb inflation, Ukraine&#x2019;s central bank has raised interest rates from 13% to 14.5% since December and may increase them further. The bank previously projected inflation would peak at 15% by mid-2025 before falling to 8.4% by year-end. Meanwhile, Ukraine&#x2019;s 2025 budget deficit is expected to reach 19.4% of GDP, but the country has secured $38.4 billion in foreign aid to cover the shortfall. This includes $13.7 billion from the EU, $22 billion from G7 countries using frozen Russian assets, and $2.7 billion from the IMF. Despite ongoing wartime challenges, the EBRD sees several factors supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s economy in 2025: resilient businesses, a functioning Black Sea trade corridor, strong government spending, and increased military orders for domestic manufacturers.	https://kyivindependent.com/ebrd-lowers-ukraines-2025-growth-forecast-amid-inflation-war-impact/	2025-02-27T14:58:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1238699802.jpg
General accused of botching Kharkiv defense released from detention facility, lawyer says	The Kyiv Court of Appeal has released Lieutenant General Artur Horbenko from a detention facility and placed him under house arrest until March 20, online newspaper Ukrainian Pravda reported on Feb. 27, citing his lawyer Maksym Tkhorivsky. Horbenko, along with General Yurii Halushkin and Colonel Illia Lapin, was arrested on Jan. 21 on charges of mismanaging Ukraine&apos;s defense in Kharkiv Oblast during Russia&apos;s cross-border offensive in May 2024. Horbenko is suspected of negligence in military service. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) accused the three officers of failing to properly fortify the region and use all available resources to repel Russian forces. Russia&apos;s offensive into northeastern Kharkiv Oblast saw rapid advances of several kilometers, prompting criticism of military and regional leadership for inadequate defensive preparations. Although Ukrainian forces eventually stalled the Russian advance roughly 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Kharkiv, the initial breach raised concerns over strategic failures. Halushkin was accused of assigning inadequate defensive positions to the 125th Territorial Defense Brigade, which was under Horbenko&apos;s command, and failing to provide sufficient artillery and air support. While Horbenko will remain under house arrest, the status of the other detained officers remains unchanged.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-accused-of-mismanaging-kharkiv-defense-granted-house-arrest-ukrainian-pravda-reports/	2025-02-27T14:24:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/474329165_1146672037460027_6619400731941116373_n.jpg
Rutte announces NATO allies will provide Ukraine with billions more in aid	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has announced that alliance members are ramping up their defense investments and preparing additional financial support for Ukraine. His remarks came after a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 27. &quot;Great to talk with Donald Trump. US &amp; NATO are getting stronger. NATO Allies are moving quickly to invest more in defense. Big increases announced &amp; others to follow,&quot; Rutte said in a post on X. He also emphasized NATO&apos;s continued support for Ukraine, adding that &quot;on Ukraine, Allies are preparing billions more in aid and contributions to security guarantees.&quot; Rutte&#x2019;s comments signal a concerted effort by NATO members to bolster collective defense and sustain military assistance to Ukraine as the war with Russia continues. Rutte previously said that Europe is prepared to take the lead in providing security guarantees for Ukraine. His statement, posted on X on Feb. 17, followed a Paris summit hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron, where European leaders gathered ahead of upcoming U.S.-Russia talks on ending the war. &quot;Europe is ready and willing to step up. To lead in providing security guarantees for Ukraine. Ready and willing to invest a lot more in our security. The details will need to be decided, but the commitment is clear,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/rutte-announces-nato-allies-will-provide-ukraine-with-billions-more-in-aid/	2025-02-27T13:39:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2149020115.jpg
Future peacekeeping force may patrol air, sea space, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry says	Ukraine is in talks with Western allies to ensure that any future military contingent monitoring a potential ceasefire also has a role in patrolling air and sea space, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said at a news briefing on Feb. 27. &quot;If our partners and allies are ready to discuss the possible deployment of these contingents to ensure peace and security in Ukraine... then we think it is quite possible to talk about the safety of the sky,&quot; Tykhyi said. The discussion comes as the concept of a multinational peacekeeping force has been raised as a potential security guarantee for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. Tykhyi emphasized the importance of strengthening security in the Black Sea, given Russia&#x2019;s continued threats to the freedom of navigation. &quot;We are already talking about this in the negotiations with them (Western partners) and believe that this is a serious topic that needs to be discussed,&quot; he said, adding that the issue may be further addressed at the EU summit on Mar. 6. Washington has backed the idea of a European-led peacekeeping force, with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth saying on Feb. 12 that such a mission would not include U.S. troops. U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated on Feb. 26 that Europe should take primary responsibility for regional security. France, the U.K., and several other countries have signaled support for deploying peacekeepers, though European nations have yet to reach a consensus. The Washington Post reported on Feb. 17 that up to 30,000 European troops could be sent to Ukraine as part of a ceasefire monitoring mission.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-seeks-expanded-role-for-possible-peacekeeping-forces-in-air-sea-monitoring-foreign-ministry-says/	2025-02-27T13:21:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2166614075.jpg
Is Donald Trump a Russian asset? This US author is 'completely certain' he is	Questions about U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s possibly shady relationship with Russia and the country&apos;s security services have long swirled, even culminating in a special counsel investigation during his first term in office. Though that investigation found evidence of &quot;extensive criminal activity&quot; by Trump, his associates, and some of his family members, it found no evidence that he was working for, or had ever been recruited by, Russia&apos;s security services. Yet despite this, the topic refuses to go away &#x2014; most recently in a viral Facebook post from a former Kazakh security official that claimed Trump was recruited by the Soviet Union&apos;s spy agency, the KGB, in 1987 and given the code name &quot;Krasnov.&quot; Craig Unger, an American journalist and writer who has written two books on Trump&#x2019;s connections to Russia&#x2019;s security services and the Russian mafia stretching all the way back to the 1980s, says he is &quot;absolutely certain&quot; that the U.S. president is a Russian asset. According to Unger, Trump&#x2019;s current actions are benefiting Russian President Vladimir Putin, and destroying relationships with long-time allies. The Kyiv Independent sat down with Unger to hear what makes him so certain. The Kyiv Independent: A lot of the discussion around Trump and his connections to Russia gets dismissed as conspiracy theories based on circumstantial evidence. What would you say to those accusations? Craig Unger: First of all, I want to distinguish between an asset and an agent. An agent is someone who has signed on with the KGB, can be given specific tasks, and is actually paid by them. That&apos;s not the way it works with an asset. The KGB made a point of cultivating powerful businessmen &#x2014; I&apos;m thinking of Armand Hammer. He was an enormously wealthy American oil man, who was very much an asset. And he was sort of aging out when the KGB began cultivating Trump. The Kyiv Independent: How certain are you that Donald Trump is a Russian asset? Craig Unger: Completely certain. I&apos;ve written two books about it. &#x201C;House of Trump, House of Putin,&#x201D; and &#x201C;American Kompromat,&#x201D; and not a single fact has been challenged in my reporting. It really goes back to 1980 when Donald Trump was just starting out and had his first successful real estate adventure. He&apos;s had a lot of failures. This one was actually a success &#x2014; he developed the Grand Hyatt Hotel right near Grand Central Station here in New York. And like every big hotel, he needed a lot of TV sets. And he ended up buying them from the Joy Lud electronics store, which was a front for the KGB. And I got that information from a former agent with the KGB, Yuri Shvets. And it really all started from that. They sent out a spotter agent, someone who&apos;s trying to recruit talent for someone who can help the KGB later on &#x2014; and they came to Donald Trump. And that set off a series of meetings and events, which led to Trump&apos;s first visit to Moscow in 1987. Women walk past a Voentorg military store ad featuring U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in central Moscow, Russia on Jan. 19, 2017. Russian chain of military stores informed of a 10% discount for US citizens and employees of the US embassy. (Vasily Maximov/AFP via Getty Images)&#xA0;The Kyiv Independent: If you had to pick three things that are the biggest pieces of evidence that Trump was, or is a Russian asset, what would you choose? Craig Unger: In 1984, a man named David Bogatin came to Trump Tower, which is a crown jewel among Trump&apos;s buildings, and put down $6 million on the table and bought five condos. What was interesting about that was that according to FBI files, Bogatin was a member of the Russian mafia. And this was the first of many such people who are affiliated with the Russian mafia &#x2014; I found a total of 13 people &#x2014; who lived in Trump Tower or other Trump buildings. Trump was hosting the Russian mafia for many years before he even ran for president. So that&apos;s one thing. Another is when he went to Moscow in 1987. &#xA0;This was a visit that was set up by the KGB, according to Shvets. And when Trump got there, he was sort of groomed by the KGB. He came back and a lot of people have forgotten this, but he made a brief abortive run for president in 1988. He also took out a full page ad in The New York Times (NYT), that was assailing America&apos;s alliance with NATO. People are shocked today that Trump is betraying Ukraine, he&apos;s betraying Europe, he&apos;s siding with Putin. Well, he did it as early as 1987, when he was starting to run for the presidency in 1988. And that is very well documented, it was printed in the NYT. It&apos;s exactly the foreign policy he is acting out today that is so horrifying. This is the end of NATO, it&apos;s the end of the Western alliance. Trump is allying with Vladimir Putin, and against Ukraine and all of Western Europe. The Kyiv Independent: What has happened more recently to make you believe Trump is a Russian asset? Craig Unger: You saw him during his first term as president when he met with Putin in Helsinki &#x2014; he essentially said that he trusted Putin far more than American intelligence (agencies). And what we see happening now is, he is essentially destroying Western intelligence. I can&apos;t imagine Ukraine or any European partners wanting to share intelligence with the U.S., as long as Trump is president, because it&apos;s likely to be passed straight along to Vladimir Putin. The Kyiv Independent: Just last week there was a Facebook post from somebody who professes to have been part of the KGB in Kazakhstan during the 1980s and he said Trump was recruited then. Craig Unger: Yes, I&apos;m aware of that post, I have not been able to corroborate it. If I&apos;m not mistaken, he was talking about the sixth directorate in the KGB. I&apos;m not sure they were recruiting American assets. And the first director and the second director of the KGB were doing that mostly. So I really can&apos;t corroborate it. The Kyiv Independent: As an American citizen, how does all of this make you feel? Craig Unger: I&apos;m petrified, to be honest. When I grew up, the movie that I loved in my childhood was &#x201C;The Manchurian Candidate,&#x201D; the original, 1962 version. It posited that the communists had gotten inside the White House. And that was the whole premise. And it was seen as incredibly conspiratorial. The idea that it could actually happen in some way is just breathtaking. And I think we&apos;re entering a new era in the U.S. And we have to fight back. Because I would very much like to keep an alliance with my friends in Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/is-donald-trump-a-russian-asset-this-us-author-is-completely-certain-he-is/	2025-02-27T12:27:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198674851.jpg
Trump extends some sanctions against Russia until 2026	U.S. President Donald Trump has extended some of the sanctions against Russia until March 6, 2026, according to a decree set to be published in the U.S. Federal Register on Feb. 28. The decree, which is available on the U.S. Federal Register&apos;s site, extends the state of emergency over the situation in Ukraine that was first declared on March 6, 2014 under then-President Barack Obama in response to Russia&apos;s annexation of Crimea. The decree also extends related sanctions imposed by Obama. &quot;The actions and policies addressed in these Executive Orders continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States,&quot; the decree reads. The decision comes amid Trump&apos;s renewed engagement with Russia, including talks on Feb. 18 on ending the war in Ukraine and the potential reopening of embassies in Washington and Moscow. While Trump said on Feb. 25 that sanctions against Russia would be lifted &quot;at some point,&quot; he has also said they would remain in place until a peace deal is reached. Trump suggested on Jan. 21 that additional sanctions would be imposed on Russia if President Vladimir Putin did not reach an agreement with Ukraine. The U.S. has maintained extensive economic restrictions on Russia since the start of its full-scale invasion in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-signs-decree-extending-sanctions-on-russia-emergency-status/	2025-02-27T12:27:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198945928.jpg
Trump, Starmer meet as UK urges continued US support for Ukraine	U.S. President Donald Trump met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House on Feb. 27, as Starmer sought to convince Washington to maintain its role in Ukraine&apos;s security amid ongoing Russian aggression. Starmer reiterated the need for a U.S. &quot;backstop&quot; for a proposed European peacekeeping force in Ukraine, arguing that American support would be necessary for ensuring a lasting peace. Trump emphasized that a peace deal must be reached before any peacekeeping forces are deployed. &quot;I have confidence if we make a deal, it&apos;s going to hold,&quot; he said, adding that securing Ukraine&apos;s long-term stability after an agreement is reached would be &quot;the easy part.&quot; The idea of a multinational peacekeeping force has been floated as a potential security guarantee for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. The meeting came ahead of President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s scheduled visit to Washington on Feb. 28, where he is set to sign a critical minerals agreement with the U.S. The deal establishes a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the &quot;future monetization&quot; of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. Zelensky initially rejected the agreement over the absence of security guarantees but later said that discussions on guarantees would take place in future negotiations. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump referenced Zelensky&apos;s upcoming visit, emphasizing America&apos;s need for rare earth minerals. &quot;President Zelensky is coming to see me on Friday morning,&quot; Trump said. &quot;And we&apos;re going to be signing really a very important agreement for both sides because it&apos;s really going to get us into that country, working there.&quot; The past few weeks have seen a shift in U.S. policy, with the Trump administration taking a more confrontational stance toward Ukraine while intensifying diplomatic outreach to Russia in an effort to broker a swift agreement. U.S. and Russian officials have resumed high-level bilateral talks, holding meetings in Riyadh on Feb. 18 and Istanbul on Feb. 27.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-starmer-meet-as-uk-urges-continued-us-support-for-ukraine/	2025-02-27T12:20:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2202329109.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Trump says he 'can't believe' he called Zelensky 'dictator'	Key developments on Feb. 27: U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 27 that he could not believe he had called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator.&quot; Trump made the comment at a briefing with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House. &quot;Did I say that? I can&apos;t believe I would say that,&quot; Trump responded when asked whether he still considers Zelensky a &quot;dictator.&quot; Trump referred to Zelensky as a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; in a Truth Social post on Feb. 19, falsely accusing him of refusing to hold elections and repeating the Kremlin narrative about Zelensky&apos;s alleged illegitimacy. Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. If martial law had not been imposed, Zelensky&apos;s term would have ended on May 20, 2024. Both Russia and some of Zelensky&apos;s domestic critics claim that he ceased to be a legitimate president on May 20. Major Ukrainian constitutional lawyers and legal experts believe the claim is false and unfounded. A Feb. 19 poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) showed that 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky, marking a five-point increase since December. Asked about the potential longevity of a peace agreement with Russia, Trump expressed confidence that any deal his administration reaches would hold. &quot;I have confidence if we make a deal it&apos;s going to hold,&quot; he said, adding that securing Ukraine&apos;s long-term stability after a deal is reached would be &quot;the easy part.&quot; The Trump administration has disrupted years of U.S. foreign policy towards Russia. U.S. and Russian officials have resumed high-level bilateral talks, holding meetings in Riyadh on Feb. 18 and Istanbul on Feb. 27. The U.S. president also said that he does not believe Putin would launch another invasion of Ukraine once a peace deal is reached. When asked on Feb. 24 whether he considers Putin a dictator, Trump avoided the question, saying, &quot;I don&apos;t use those words lightly... I think we&apos;re going to see how it all works out.&quot; Elections have been routinely rigged in Russia, genuine opposition candidates have not been allowed to run, and the Kremlin&apos;s monopoly on television ensured that only government-backed candidates have air time. In 2020, Russia held a rigged vote on constitutional amendments that eliminated limits on Putin&apos;s presidential terms, effectively making him dictator for life. More than 20 opponents of Putin have been killed or died in mysterious circumstances. Moscow and Washington are ready to re-establish cooperation, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Feb. 27 during a meeting of the Federal Security Service&apos;s (FSB) board, praising the Trump administration for its &quot;pragmatism.&quot; In recent days, the Trump administration has upended years of U.S. foreign policy towards Russia and Ukraine. U.S. and Russian officials resumed high-level bilateral contacts, holding meetings in Riyadh on Feb. 18 and Istanbul on Feb. 27. Speaking as the Russian delegates were concluding their talks in Turkey, Putin described the first contacts between Russia and the U.S. as &quot;inspiring certain hopes.&quot; He also claimed that some Western countries are dissatisfied with the restoration of Russian-American relations and want to &quot;create instability in the world.&quot; &quot;These forces will try to disrupt or compromise the dialogue that has begun,&quot; Putin said, without providing any evidence. &quot;We need to take it into account and use all the means of diplomacy and intelligence services to disrupt such attempts.&quot; Ukraine has been excluded from the talks in Saudi Arabia, sparking concerns that the Trump administration seeks to sideline Kyiv. The subsequent talks in Istanbul were allegedly focused on embassy operations and did not concern the Russia-Ukraine war. During the talks in Riyadh, Moscow allegedly demanded that the U.S. withdraw NATO forces from eastern Europe as a condition for &quot;normalizing relations,&quot; the Financial Times reported, citing two officials in the region. The U.S. delegation reportedly rejected the demand, but concerns remain over what concessions President Donald Trump might consider to secure a deal with Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that he wants European allies to be involved in peace negotiations. Kyiv insists that no talks about Ukraine and ending Russia&apos;s war should be held without Ukraine. Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, said that Europe will not be directly involved in negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, but its interests will be considered. Russia may lose its chance for world leadership if it does not halt its full-scale war against Ukraine by 2026, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) head Kyrylo Budanov said in an interview with Ukrinform published on Feb. 27. Earlier this month, Budanov said he believes that Ukraine and Russia will reach a ceasefire this year. His comments come as U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed to mediate a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia while using increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Kyiv. Asked whether the Kremlin wants to make a peace deal now to build up its strength, Budanov agreed, saying that Russia needs a break. &quot;According to their (Russia&apos;s) strategy, if they don&apos;t get out of this war by 2026, they lose even a chance for world leadership. They will be left with a maximum level of regional leadership, which they are absolutely not satisfied with,&quot; the spy chief said. According to Budanov, the financial cost of the war is &quot;too high&quot; for Moscow, which prevents it from focusing on development and large-scale projects. Russia has problems with its economy, but it will be able to &quot;balance&quot; it out as long as it has oil, gas, and precious metals, he added. &quot;There is a lack of technologies, technological solutions that are not available in Russia, primarily for the development of the Arctic region, gas production, etc.,&quot; Budanov said. Throughout the three years of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine&apos;s Western partners imposed heavy sanctions on Moscow to undermine its ability to wage war. Initially, Russia has largely weathered the sanctions, circumventing economic restrictions through third-party countries and various loopholes. The situation appears to be shifting as Russia has faced mounting economic challenges over the past months, compounded by labor shortages and military spending-induced inflation that led to record interest rates. In the fall of 2023, Budanov said that Russia likely has the economic and technical capacity to continue its war against Ukraine until 2025 or 2026. In office since 2020, Budanov has at times made radical predictions about the full-scale war that have not always come true. Turkey has indicated its openness to deploying troops in Ukraine as part of a potential peacekeeping force, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 27, citing sources familiar with the matter. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan discussed the possibility with President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov during separate meetings in Ankara earlier in February, according to Bloomberg. Moscow has publicly opposed NATO troops in Ukraine, but Russia has not given Turkey a concrete response on the proposal, Bloomberg reported. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 20 that Russia was concerned about NATO countries discussing a potential deployment of peacekeepers. Sources told Bloomberg that Turkey would not participate unless it is directly involved in all consultations and preparations for such a mission. The idea of a multinational peacekeeping force has been floated as a potential security guarantee for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. While Washington has supported the concept, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Feb. 12 that such a mission would not include U.S. troops and should be led by European and non-European allies. France, the U.K., and several other countries have expressed support for a peacekeeping force, but European nations have yet to reach a consensus. Ukraine has regrouped its troops on the battlefield, slowing down Russian forces&apos; advance in the most &quot;threatening areas,&quot; Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Feb. 27. Russian troops are actively pushing on the Novopavlivka sector in eastern Donetsk Oblast, trying to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense and capture three settlements, according to Syrskyi.He did not specify which settlements he meant.The village of Novopavlivka in Donetsk Oblast lies some 5 kilometers (3 miles) north of the embattled city of Pokrovsk, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian troops in the region. The estimated Russian advance near Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, as of Feb. 26, 2025, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)&quot;However, our side has taken a number of measures to improve the interaction of military units and subdivisions, regrouped troops, which slowed down... (Russia&apos;s) advance in most threatening areas,&quot; the general said after visiting the front line.Since the beginning of the day, 110 clashes between Ukrainian and Russian forces have taken place along the front line, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said in its latest update on Feb. 27. According to Syrskyi, Russia continues trying to reach the administrative border of Donetsk Oblast, suffering heavy losses. &quot;The plans remain unfulfilled,&quot; he said.A day before, the 25th Separate Airborne Brigade reported that Ukrainian troops had regained control of the village of Kotlyne, near Pokrovsk. Kotlyne and Pokrovsk are connected by the T 0406 highway, which also leads to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Russian troops recaptured the village of Nikolsky in embattled Kursk Oblast, some 42 kilometers (26 miles) north of the Ukrainian-occupied town of Sudzha, Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Feb. 27. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, senior Russian General Staff officer Sergei Rudsky said earlier in February. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claims that its troops continue to advance and push Ukrainian forces out of the salient. Kyiv has not commented on purportedly lost settlements in Kursk Oblast. According to Rudsky, Ukrainian soldiers control about 500 square kilometers (193 square miles) out of 1,268 square kilometers (490 square miles) initially seized by Kyiv. Russian casualties have reached nearly 40,000 in Kursk Oblast, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 6. Another 909 have been reportedly taken as prisoners of war. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Ukraine likely seeks to use its foothold in Kursk Oblast as leverage in potential peace talks. Russia&apos;s forces in Kursk Oblast have been bolstered by North Korean troops, deployed last fall to help counter the Ukrainian incursion. President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that the offensive disrupted Russia&apos;s ability to carry out large-scale operations in northeastern and southern Ukraine.

US Senator Bernie Sanders: ‘Trump likes what Putin does’	As Ukraine enters the fourth year of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, shifting political dynamics in the U.S. threaten to influence the course of the war. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly misrepresented the war&#x2019;s origins, excluded Ukraine from initial negotiations, and advocated for what many see as an exploitative deal that would force Ukraine to surrender national resources as &#x201C;repayment&#x201D; for U.S. aid. Trump&#x2019;s rhetoric raises urgent questions about America&apos;s long-term commitment to aiding Ukraine. In an interview with the Kyiv Independent, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders shares his concerns about Trump&#x2019;s growing alignment with Russia and other authoritarian regimes, what a possible U.S.-Russia alliance would mean for the American people, the role of billionaires like Elon Musk in shaping both domestic and international political discourse, and why defending Ukraine is crucial for the future of global democracy. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. The Kyiv Independent: Recently, a number of Republicans have hesitated to say outright that Russia invaded Ukraine. At the same time, Donald Trump has not only called President Volodymyr Zelensky a dictator &#x2014; he has spoken in increasingly favorable terms about Russian President Vladimir Putin. What is going on with the state of the GOP right now? Bernie Sanders: What is extraordinarily distressing to the majority of the American people is that we now have a president who has very strong authoritarian tendencies, and in many ways, is moving the U.S., the longest-standing democracy on Earth, into an authoritarian-style society. In many ways, Trump likes what Putin does. Putin does not allow freedom of the press. Putin kills his opponents. Putin does not allow dissent &#x2014; and that&apos;s kind of a model that Trump likes. For the first time in modern history, we have a president who is aligning himself with authoritarian governments all over the world, not only Russia but with Iran, with Belarus, rather than with democratic governments in Europe and Ukraine. It is a very distressing moment. As part of that movement toward authoritarianism, you have people like Elon Musk, the richest guy in the world, who says to Republicans that if you don&apos;t do what the U.S. president wants you to do, we&apos;re going to spend unlimited amounts of money to defeat you (in your next election) &#x2014; so you better get in line. Obviously, everybody in America knows that Russia started this war. But you have Republicans who are just too afraid to speak up against Trump. It&apos;s a sad state of affairs. The Kyiv Independent: Let&apos;s imagine the worst-case scenario where American foreign interests align with Russia&apos;s. How would that impact the lives of average Americans? Bernie Sanders: Well, for a start, it would undermine what the U.S. has been about for 250 years. America is the longest-standing democracy on Earth. For so many years, it hasn&#x2019;t been perfect. God knows American democracy is not perfect and that our foreign policy over the years has had many, many flaws. But the truth is that developing nations look to the U.S., to our constitution, to our Declaration of Independence, to our appreciation of human freedom and democracy and say that that makes sense.And now for us to shift into alliances with authoritarian thugs and murderers like Putin or the Saudi Arabian government or other oligarchies is extremely distressing to the vast majority of American people. The Kyiv Independent: Do you think that history will look back favorably upon the past decade of military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine? Bernie Sanders: I think what history will show is that a country was invaded by a large authoritarian nation with a powerful army who thought that they could conquer another country in a few days. But that country, Ukraine, fought back with extraordinary courage and has suffered terribly as a result. Its European allies, democratic nations, have stood up to Putin and come to their aid. And up until now, the U.S. and the people of America have also supported Ukraine. At a time when democracy all over the world is under threat, when we&apos;re seeing increased power for oligarchs and authoritarians, I think defending Ukraine is defending democracy and justice all over the world.

(Charly Triballeau/ AFP P/ Pugliano/Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: We see figures like Musk working alongside Trump while also regularly spreading Russian disinformation online. What can the U.S. do to better fight Russian propaganda? Bernie Sanders: That&apos;s an issue that we are thinking about and working on every single day. And I&apos;ll give you another example. It&apos;s not just Musk and his power from owning Twitter, which is extraordinary. He has extraordinary reach. And by the way, don&apos;t think it&apos;s just Ukraine that he is going after. In terms of domestic policies, we passed some important legislation here. Musk lied about that legislation and got Republicans to defeat it a couple of months ago. But it&apos;s not just Musk. The second wealthiest man in the country, Jeff Bezos, decided to convert the Washington Post, one of our major newspapers, from what I would call a centrist moderate paper to a right-wing editorial page. He just made that public yesterday. So this is a difficult moment for my country, for people who believe in democracy and who don&#x2019;t believe in oligarchy. And we are doing our best, not only in terms of Ukraine but in many, many other areas, to take on Musk and his enormous power and Trump. But I do want to say &#x2014; as somebody who has gone around the country &#x2014; &#xA0;I want the people of Ukraine to know that the majority of the American people do not believe Trump. Trump is a pathological liar, and most Americans know that. Most Americans know that Russia started the war, not Ukraine. Most Americans know that Putin is the dictator, not Zelensky. Most Americans know that under terrible conditions, Ukraine has fought back valiantly and is admired and respected by people all over the world. I want you all to know that. The Kyiv Independent: What can the average American do in these uncertain coming weeks and months to show their support for Ukraine? Bernie Sanders: I think we have got to stand up and expose Trump for the liar that he is. The idea that he would, in the middle of a terrible war where you have lost tens and tens of thousands of people &#x2014; (among them) men, women, and children &#x2014; propose extractions of rare minerals from Ukraine when it is struggling so much is quite outrageous. What we are doing (here in the U.S.) is going all over the country. We&apos;re seeing large numbers of people coming out and saying Trumpism, authoritarianism, and oligarchy are not what the U.S. is about. We have reason to be proud that we are the longest-standing democracy on Earth, and we intend to keep it that way. It was a great honor for me to talk to U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, a politician I&apos;ve admired my whole adult life. Hearing people like him speak the truth about the threat of global authoritarianism and the importance of continuing to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia&apos;s war of total annihilation is more important than ever.

Trump says he 'can't believe' he called Zelensky 'dictator'	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 27 that he could not believe he had called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator.&quot; Trump made the comment at a briefing with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House. &quot;Did I say that? I can&apos;t believe I would say that,&quot; Trump responded when asked whether he still considers Zelensky a &quot;dictator.&quot; Trump referred to Zelensky as a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; in a Truth Social post on Feb. 19, falsely accusing him of refusing to hold elections and repeating the Kremlin narrative about Zelensky&apos;s alleged illegitimacy. Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. If martial law had not been imposed, Zelensky&apos;s term would have ended on May 20, 2024. Both Russia and some of Zelensky&apos;s domestic critics claim that he ceased to be a legitimate president on May 20. Major Ukrainian constitutional lawyers and legal experts believe the claim is false and unfounded. A Feb. 19 poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) showed that 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky, marking a five-point increase since December. Asked about the potential longevity of a peace agreement with Russia, Trump expressed confidence that any deal his administration reaches would hold. &quot;I have confidence if we make a deal it&apos;s going to hold,&quot; he said, adding that securing Ukraine&apos;s long-term stability after a deal is reached would be &quot;the easy part.&quot; The Trump administration has disrupted years of U.S. foreign policy towards Russia. U.S. and Russian officials have resumed high-level bilateral talks, holding meetings in Riyadh on Feb. 18 and Istanbul on Feb. 27. The U.S. president also said that he does not believe Putin would launch another invasion of Ukraine once a peace deal is reached. When asked on Feb. 24 whether he considers Putin a dictator, Trump avoided the question, saying, &quot;I don&apos;t use those words lightly... I think we&apos;re going to see how it all works out.&quot; Elections have been routinely rigged in Russia, genuine opposition candidates have not been allowed to run, and the Kremlin&apos;s monopoly on television ensured that only government-backed candidates have air time. In 2020, Russia held a rigged vote on constitutional amendments that eliminated limits on Putin&apos;s presidential terms, effectively making him dictator for life. More than 20 opponents of Putin have been killed or died in mysterious circumstances.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-says-he-cant-believe-he-called-zelensky-a-dictator/	2025-02-27T11:28:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197144376--1-.jpg
63-year-old Russian film critic put under house arrest in Moscow for ‘fake news’ about war in Ukraine	Independent Russian film critic Ekaterina Barabash was placed under house arrest by a Moscow court for posting &#x201C;fake news&#x201D; on her Facebook account about the war in Ukraine, her son Yurii Barabash reported on Facebook on Feb. 26. Detained by the Russian Investigative Committee on Feb. 25, Barabash will remain under house arrest until April 25. The Russian Investigative Committee, which is supposed to probe serious federal crimes, claimed in a Telegram post on Feb. 26 that Barabash &#x201C;admitted her guilt in full&#x201D; during an interrogation. Crackdowns on freedom of expression in Russia have only intensified since the start of Moscow&#x2019;s full-scale war against Ukraine. &#x201C;We do not know who reported her. Given that she is a public figure, it&#x2019;s possible that her social media could have been under digital surveillance by the Russian security services,&#x201D; Yurii, who was born in Russia but has lived and worked in Ukraine for more than 15 years, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;She understood the risks involved (in speaking out). For her, it was impossible to remain silent while witnessing what the country she had lived in all her life was doing to the country where she was born &#x2014; a country she loves and considers her true homeland.&#x201D; Born in Kharkiv, Barabash is the daughter of a famous Ukrainian literary scholar. For speaking out in support of Ukraine fighting against a war of total annihilation, the 63-year-old could face a financial fine of up to five million rubles ($57,500) or up to 10 years in prison. Accusing Russian citizens under Article 207.3, Part 2 of the criminal code of spreading &#x201C;knowingly false&#x201D; information about the military is a common method used by the Russian regime to silence dissent. In 2024 alone, at least 620 people faced politically motivated charges in Russia and the occupied Ukrainian territories, with a 25% surge in imprisonments compared to 2023, according to the independent human rights group OVD-Info. The court documents in Barabash&#x2019;s case cite four specific Facebook posts that were scrutinized by the authorities, but only one of them remains accessible online. &#x201C;Lord, save me, make it so that I don&#x2019;t choke with hatred for these hypocrites, liars, and murders. I won&#x2019;t be able to take it anymore soon &#x2014; my heart is breaking into pieces,&#x201D; the post from early spring 2022 reads. &#x201C;(You) bastards bomb a country, raze entire cities to the ground, kill hundreds of children, shoot at peaceful people for no reason, keep Mariupol under a blockade, deprive millions of people of a normal life, and force them to leave for foreign countries. &#xA0;For what? For the sake of friendship with Ukraine? You are Evil on a planetary scale.&#x201D; Russian authorities arrested Barabash following a search of her home, according to her son. Prior to her arrest, she had returned to Moscow from attending the Berlinale Film Festival as an accredited journalist. Barabash being put under house arrest following her detention is &#x201C;the best scenario we could have hoped for (given the alternatives),&#x201D; Yurii said. However, he remains unable to communicate directly with his mother, as she is prohibited from using any electronic devices. &#x201C;All the information I receive comes through her friends, who are allowed to visit her,&#x201D; he said. In a video released by Russian independent media outlet Sota Vision, Barabash can be seen in more or less good spirits following the court hearing. With a hint of irony, she inquires, &#x201C;Will it be a pretty bracelet?&#x201D; in reference to the surveillance tag authorities are set to impose on her during house arrest.

(Alexander Nemenov/AFP via Getty Images)Strength in Ukrainian heritageAfter Russia&#x2019;s 2014 invasion of Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and its illegal annexation of Crimea, Barabash considered leaving the country. But with elderly parents to care for, she made the difficult choice to stay. &#x201C;Relocating people of such an advanced age is dangerous &#x2014; some do not survive the journey. I understand her in this regard,&#x201D; Ukrainian poet Lyuba Yakimchuk, who is Barabash&#x2019;s daughter-in-law, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;My grandmother, who relocated from Russian occupation (in Luhansk Oblast) at a much younger age, did not endure the move, struggled to adapt, and passed away soon after.&#x201D; Barabash&#x2019;s father, a recipient of Ukraine&#x2019;s prestigious Shevchenko Prize for his work on Ukrainian literature, passed away in November. Barabash&#x2019;s mother marked her 96th birthday just two days before her daughter&#x2019;s arrest. According to Yurii, Barabash&#x2019;s father &#x201C;raised his daughter to think freely and critically,&#x201D; and the Barabash family &#x201C;has always been proud of our Ukrainian heritage.&quot; Yurii was raised in a home where Ukrainian was spoken freely, instilling in him a deep understanding of his heritage &#x2014; one untouched by Russian imperialist narratives. Her deep connection to her Ukrainian heritage gave her the resolve to speak out against Russian aggression and those who support it, according to her family. Her most recent article, published on Feb. 25 in Republic &#x2014; a media outlet designated a &#x201C;foreign agent&#x201D; by the Kremlin in 2022 &#x2014; criticized Russian theater director Konstantin Bogomolov, who had expressed interest in staging a play glorifying Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s &#x201C;successes.&#x201D; Bogomolov is also the husband of Ksenia Sobchak, a socialite who once cast herself as an opposition figure but has long been seen as a Kremlin insider. In the article, Barabash delivered a scathing takedown of Bogomolov and all those who promote Russian state propaganda, suggesting the play be titled &#x201C;Kyiv in Three Days&#x201D; &#x2014; a nod to the Kremlin&#x2019;s boasts back in 2022 of what they thought would be a swift victory in Ukraine. &#x201C;After all, that&#x2019;s the greatest victory of your new object of admiration,&#x201D; Barabash wrote. As U.S. President Donald Trump speaks in increasingly favorable terms about Russia, it&apos;s important not to forget that Russian President Vladimir Putin is a dictator who has held onto power through brutal crackdowns on dissent. We have to admire those in Russia who are brave enough to stand up to the Kremlin despite knowing the terrible risk, especially those who are openly pro-Ukrainian in the midst of their country&apos;s genocidal war.

Trump considered canceling Zelensky's visit, changed his mind after meeting Macron, TV channel reports	U.S. President Donald Trump considered canceling President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s visit to Washington but reversed the decision after speaking with French President Emmanuel Macron, the French TV network BFMTV reported on Feb. 27, citing a French diplomatic source. Zelensky&apos;s visit to the U.S. is scheduled for Feb. 28. According to the report, Kyiv received a message on Feb. 26 from Washington stating that Zelensky&apos;s visit and meeting with Trump would not take place. &#xA0; This development follows weeks of pressure from Trump&apos;s administration on Ukraine to finalize a minerals deal. Trump publicly attacked Zelensky on Feb. 19, calling him a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; and warning that he must &quot;move fast, or he won&apos;t have a country left.&quot; After Zelensky had talked to Macron, the French president allegedly intervened and convinced Trump to proceed with the meeting, BFMTV reported. Macron visited the U.S. president in Washington on Feb. 24 to discuss Ukraine&apos;s postwar security options in the event of a peace deal with Russia. The U.S. president announced on Feb. 26 that Zelensky would visit Washington on Feb. 28. Zelensky&apos;s visit comes as Kyiv and Washington agreed to establish a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the &quot;future monetization&quot; of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. While Zelensky initially rejected the agreement due to the absence of security guarantees, he later said discussions on guarantees would take place in future negotiations. The finalized deal does not include specific security commitments from the U.S., though the agreement references Washington&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s efforts to obtain such guarantees.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-considered-canceling-zelenskys-washington-visit-changed-mind-after-macron-talks-media-reports/	2025-02-27T10:28:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170591813.jpg
Lawmakers fail to summon ministers for explanation of Ukraine-US minerals deal	Ukrainian lawmakers failed to secure enough votes on Feb. 27 to summon ministers for an explanation of the mineral agreement with the U.S. approved by the Cabinet. On Feb. 26, Ukraine&apos;s Cabinet of Ministers approved the decision to sign the deal. The agreement, which is expected to be signed in Washington on Feb. 28, establishes a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the future monetization of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. The final version of the agreement excludes revenue streams already contributing to Ukraine&apos;s budget and drops an earlier U.S. demand for a $500 billion claim over Ukraine&#x2019;s resources. A proposal to summon Shmyhal and Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko for questioning on the deal fell short, with only 138 lawmakers voting to summon the prime minister and 125 supporting a hearing for Svyrydenko. While media have published the agreement&apos;s text, a separate agreement will outline further details, including the structure of the Investment Fund for Recovery. Zelensky confirmed in his evening address on Feb. 26 that he will meet Trump on Feb. 28 to finalize the deal.	https://kyivindependent.com/lawmakers-fail-to-summon-ministers-for-explanation-of-ukraine-us-minerals-deal/	2025-02-27T09:16:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1643784971.jpg
‘As long as Russia is advancing, the war will continue’— military analyst Rob Lee on what awaits Ukraine in 2025	As Ukraine entered its fourth year of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war, it was geopolitics, not the war itself, that dominated headlines, as Kyiv&#x2019;s relationship with new U.S. President Donald Trump nosedived over a proposed minerals deal. In the meantime though, the battlefield continues to rage on multiple fronts, with daily Russian assaults continuing through a period of consistent sub-zero temperatures across eastern Ukraine. The most intense fighting continues to be in southern Donetsk Oblast, where, although Russian territorial gains have slowed to a halt outside the key city of Pokrovsk, Ukraine&#x2019;s defense of the area around Kurakhove buckled over the first months of 2025. Going forward, many unpredictable factors hang over the next year of the war. Ukraine is trying to solidify its defense with new reforms, Russia faces questions over its ability to sustain its current rate of attacks and losses, while looming largest is the future of U.S. aid. To reflect on the key conclusions of the third year of the full-scale war and what to look out for in the fourth, the Kyiv Independent sat down with the U.S.-based military analyst and senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Rob Lee during a working visit to Kyiv. Rob Lee, the U.S.-based military analyst and Senior Fellow at the Foreign Policy Research on Feb. 22, 2025, in Kyiv, Ukraine. (The Kyiv Independent)The interview has been edited for clarity and length. The Kyiv Independent: How would you describe how 2024 went for Ukraine, and what kind of core issues have really defined it? Rob Lee: 2024 was a year in which Russia had a number of advantages. They had scaled the production of ammunition before this &#x2013; the U.S. and Europe were trying to catch up to that. They had already received significant support from North Korea, from Iran, both in terms of ammunition, equipment, and now obviously troops from North Korea. Ukraine began the year in a position of weakness, where they struggled to replace manpower losses from the summer of 2023 offensive. And we know the U.S. delayed passing the aid package for about six months until April 2024. So last winter was a quite difficult time for Ukraine, where there was a lack of fortifications. We know that Ukraine has improved on that since then. There&apos;s a lack of manpower, still a problem, and there was a key lack of ammunition too. I would say on the positive side, it&apos;s obviously been a very difficult year for Ukraine, but the worst-case scenario did not happen. We didn&apos;t see any kind of significant breakthrough, like an operational breakthrough. We&apos;ve seen incremental attritional assaults. Russia has made advances. It is still a very difficult situation on the front line, but there was a possibility that things would have gotten worse. We came here three times in 2024. If I gave a summary of the findings from those trips, the manpower situation progressively got worse each time. The brigades we were meeting at the front line were more and more on their strength each time we came. The average age of Ukrainian infantry was going up each time, so maybe it was 40 at the beginning of the year. It became 45 later on, and we were hearing in October that brigades had an average age of 50-year-olds as infantry. It was very clear that there was a sense of maybe not exhaustion, but just of being fatigued or tired. Obviously, people have been fighting this war for three years now, a high-intensity conventional war. But look, Ukrainians are still fighting. They&apos;re still putting up a very tough defense. The Kyiv Independent: The Russian advance now seems to have really slowed down, is that, from the Russian side, more resembling to you an operational pause or a greater kind of lack of this same ability to attack with expendable infantry at the same rate? Rob Lee: So on both sides, there&apos;s a general sense of weakness. When we look at the forces, both militaries have significant experience now in combat. Three years of experience. But the experience is not evenly distributed across the force. So UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) units, UAV pilots are extremely capable on both sides now. Artillery crews are very capable because many of these people have three years of experience. The attrition of FPV (first-person view drone) pilots and artillery is lower, and so in many cases you have cohesive units that have operated for years. So they&apos;re very, very capable. But the infantry side has become degraded on both sides. Most of the attrition and casualties is suffered by the infantry. And so in many cases, in an infantry squad, many of the people are going to be new, with probably less than a month of experience in many cases. I think Russia made a choice: Instead of trying to develop well-trained, cohesive units, they&apos;ve kind of accepted this attritional fight where we&apos;re going to get a lot of infantry, we&apos;re going to get a lot of manpower, we&apos;re going to throw them into assaults. We&apos;re not going to train them that much. We&apos;re not going to really focus on that. And, of course, the quality is not that great. On both sides, the average age (of the infantry) is quite high. The Russian side is probably lower than Ukraine, but you&apos;re still getting plenty of people in their 40s, 50s, 60s. You&apos;re getting people who are in debt that need the money. If you sign a contract to join the Russian military, you go into an assault unit, the likelihood of being killed or wounded within a month is quite high. And I think it&apos;s a question about how much the Russians know about that. Do they know how dire the situation is? That&apos;s not clear. But it&apos;s certainly an issue where Ukrainian brigades are very understrength. Russia is still struggling to break through them. And that&apos;s partially because Russia has weaknesses. They just don&apos;t have as much equipment as they did before. They don&apos;t have the artillery advantage they had before. Their infantry is not as capable as it was before. So even if their infantry takes a position, they&apos;re not really trying to achieve a breakthrough. It&apos;s kind of trying to take the next tree line, and they&apos;re content doing that. On the Ukrainian side, despite the issues with infantry, we know they&apos;ve significantly scaled the production of FPVs and UAVs. The Defense Ministry said it was 1.6 million produced last year &#x2013; very impressive numbers. Pilots of the &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot; division prepare drones for a combat flight in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine, on May 16, 2024. (Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)The quality of FPVs has gone up tremendously. The best Ukrainian young engineers are all working on these things. And so the innovation is very fast. You have a number of (drone) regiments that are being formed as separate regiments. And those units are just extremely efficient. They are like industrial-size killing machines at the front line. And they&apos;ve really improved the coordination between UAV units, which was a really significant issue early in the war. And so I think there are two factors. On one hand, Ukraine has improved a number of things in terms of UAV use. And out of necessity, Ukraine has to innovate because they don&apos;t have enough manpower. There is a greater political sensitivity to catalysts in Ukraine than there is in Russia, where it&apos;s obviously very low. And they can&apos;t fight the same way that Russia can fight. So on one hand, it&apos;s this innovation that Ukraine is succeeding in. On the other hand, it&apos;s Russia &#x2013; they have resource advantage, but they&apos;re struggling to really capitalize on it as much as they possibly could. The Kyiv Independent: When we talk with experts and commanders, manpower seems to be the biggest issue. And it almost seems like it can only get worse because Ukraine&apos;s overall manpower is limited. It&apos;s not something that foreign aid can replace. What are the most important steps Ukraine can make? Rob Lee: One of the things that&apos;s been announced is an attempt to increase the number of volunteers from the 18 to 24-year-old age bracket. Someone mentioned this week that they&apos;d received 10,000 applications &#x2013; I don&apos;t know all the facts there, we&apos;ll have to wait and see. In the beginning of the war in 2022, Ukraine obviously had a professional military and then there was a massive influx of volunteers. And those volunteers really sustained the war in 2022. You had very motivated people. You had some of the best, most educated, the highest-ranked people in Ukraine fighting in 2022. And as casualties mounted in 2023 and 2024, it went back to being a kind of mobilized military, in which case you get kind of a mix of results. You get some people who are still motivated to fight, some people who are less motivated to fight. And of course, the military in 2025, it&apos;s a mobilized military. In the infantry in particular, you&apos;re not getting volunteers. I think the last group of volunteers for the infantry were the convicts. There are several issues. One of them is trust. It&apos;s about if you were sent to the military and you were given a certain job, to know that you are not going to be sent into infantry. The Kyiv Independent: But the infantry is where you need the new people in the first place.Rob Lee: Right. In all wars, it&apos;s the infantry that has the highest burden by far, that shows the burden. They don&apos;t rotate that often. We should not underestimate how much of a burden these guys are holding. It&apos;s really tremendous. And there&apos;s no end date. There&apos;s no demobilization system. And so it&apos;s very difficult. The U.S. has been pushing for the mobilization age to be reduced to 18. I don&apos;t know, and I&apos;m not Ukrainian. It&apos;s kind of a political decision, so I don&apos;t want to wade into it. There are Ukrainians who believe that&apos;s the right move to do, but I also know many that don&apos;t think it&apos;s the right move to do, including people who are fighting, who think that the age pool from 30 to 50 is still large enough. There are more people who can mobilize to fight. And if you keep reducing the age pool, then men or boys who are in high school are going to be sent out of the country, so more families are going to be broken apart. You&apos;ll get more people who go AWOL to avoid the war. And of course, a lot of the most educated, best engineers are 18 to 24-year-olds, and you want them to be able to sustain the economy. So it&apos;s not fully clear that that&apos;s the solution. But the problem is that we&apos;re three years into the war, and the manpower pool is not what it was at the beginning of the war. And look, Russia has a lot of men, and they clearly have a lot of men who are willing to sign up for contracts to go into fighting. There&apos;s little political sensitivity.

(Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)We know Vladimir Putin has been resisting another mobilization campaign, but he probably can do it. He could probably do an unlimited campaign. I think he has enough control domestically in Russia, where it probably won&apos;t create such significant political turmoil. So this is still a really big issue for 2025 &#x2013; if Ukraine can at least fix or not let the manpower situation worsen &#x2013; because I think Russia could probably sustain this war this year. The Kyiv Independent: Yes, with mobilization, it&apos;s being done here in a democracy, and it is causing tensions. But when people say it will cause real unrest in Russia, I think people forget about what kind of a state Russia is. Rob Lee: And just one thing to add: In Russia, they can execute soldiers. If soldiers turn around, they will be executed. And so they don&apos;t, so they get pushed forward. And we also see all these videos of Russian soldiers committing suicide &#x2013; just kind of can&apos;t imagine a worse situation than basically serving the Russian military. In Ukraine, that&apos;s not going to happen, right? The Ukrainian commanders are not going to execute soldiers who are unwilling to fight, and so you have to deal with it in different ways. It is a democracy, and there&apos;s greater value for the lives of Ukrainian soldiers than there is for the Russian military. The Kyiv Independent: How realistic is, maybe not completely, but to what scale can infantry be truly replaced by unmanned systems on the ground? Rob Lee: Well, we&apos;re going to see this year. One of the key priorities, I think, for Ukraine&apos;s government this year is to scale up the production of unmanned ground vehicles. There are significantly more companies developing new GVs, offering them, than last year. There are some brigades that are very far forward using new GVs. I was told some things I can&apos;t repeat, so I&apos;ll be careful here, but I do think this year we&apos;re going to see a quite significant expansion in use of new GVs. The main priority is probably going to be logistics. So as we know, the most dangerous situation right now is the rotation of infantry. This is not when they&apos;re in the trenches. Once they&apos;ve built good dugouts, they can hold them pretty well. But it&apos;s rotating between the rear area to the front line, which is quite difficult with vehicles because FPVs present this kind of new threat, which often can fly maybe 10 miles or 10 kilometers past the front line. So if you can replace the use of vehicles for logistics, that can really significantly improve the situation. Some of these new GVs are quite large. They can bring logs and other things to build better fortifications. And for some of the brigades, a majority of supplies are being moved by UGVs right now. There are still limitations. So operating UAVs, UGVs is still very manpower intensive. We&apos;re talking about four-man teams. Usually, it requires a lot of coordination. This is how Ukraine has to innovate and adapt to the situation. Russia has more manpower. Ukraine cannot afford to lose more infantry. That is a key issue. And so UGVs are part of this, just as UAVs were for compensating for lack of artillery ammunition or lack of infantry right now. The Kyiv Independent: We&apos;ve heard about plans to change the Ukrainian military into a corps system. How do you assess that decision and how can it be executed in a situation where the military is so overstretched along the front line? Rob Lee: The idea is the right one. A consistent problem throughout the war is that Ukraine is a brigade-style military, and there isn&apos;t really much of a command and control structure above that. You have operational strategic groups, operational tactical groups, but these commands, they&apos;re not really responsible for the units under their command. Units kind of come in and leave, whereas you want them to have long-term responsibility because then you&apos;re going to be more careful about how you use them, you&apos;re not going to have too many casualties. One of the broader problems in the Ukrainian military the last year and a half, because there&apos;s a manpower problem, is that often brigades will be piecemeal deployed across the front line, where a brigade may have two battalions in one direction, a battalion in another direction. Those battalions are attached to other brigades. That other brigade commander, they&apos;re probably going to use the attached units more aggressively than their own units, just out of a sense of survival. This has created a variety of problems. So the move to a corps structure would be useful, and I think the idea that the brigade commanders &#x2013; I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s official &#x2013; but like Khartiia Brigade, Azov, 3rd Assault, 92nd, some of the really famous units, taking the lead &#x2013; it makes sense. One of the problems last year is that Ukraine set up a number of new brigades, the 150 series. Many of them had a variety of problems, which I won&apos;t go into, but if you put those brigades under the command of another brigade that has a good culture, that does training the right way, that does leadership the right way, you can in some ways ameliorate those problems, and that&apos;s kind of an ideal situation. But as you mentioned, forming the corps right now is quite difficult. So it&apos;s going to be a big question about how it&apos;s executed. The Kyiv Independent: Going back to Russia, it almost seems like in the information space, there are two images of the Russian military. One is that Russia has upscaled its recruiting and its production, and is almost a truly unstoppable military machine. But then other people say that all they can do is human wave attacks and, at the rate of their loss, they&apos;ll lose so many million people to take this much of Ukraine. What is the real picture of the Russian military? Rob Lee: So it&apos;s a mix. There are strengths, and there are really serious weaknesses, too. Russia&apos;s certainly not unstoppable. Russia, since October 2023, they&apos;ve been strategically on the offensive, they&apos;ve had the initiative, they&apos;ve advanced in the Avdiivka direction, but other places: In Toretsk, the fight began sometime in the summer, Chasiv Yar, they got there around April, and they&apos;ve almost taken the city, but it&apos;s taken a very long time, heavy casualties. And they&apos;re still struggling to take back Kursk. A lot of this comes back to what Russia&apos;s political objectives and the military means are. So Vladimir Putin last year laid out that the minimum conditions for negotiations is control of all four oblasts that he says are part of Russia, right? Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson. Russia is a very long way from taking all those oblasts, right? So obviously Luhansk, almost all of it is Russia-controlled, although there&apos;s still very heavy fighting for the last part of it. Donetsk, there&apos;s a lot of fighting to go. Russian forces got to Pokrovsk around August, and they still have not been able to encircle it for a long time at heavy costs, and obviously Ukraine has had some counterattacks the last few weeks, retaking some areas. So not only have they not taken Pokrovsk, but trying to get to Kostiantynivka, Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk, Sloviansk &#x2013; at this rate, it could take quite a long time. And of course, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, this is something far, far removed. Russia&apos;s still very far from achieving its minimum objectives in this war. But they have a significant manpower advantage. They recruited a large number of contract soldiers last year. That means they can sustain this war for this year, at least, in terms of manpower. As it later goes on, this could be a more significant issue. Some capabilities Russia has are much more capable now than they were before. They&apos;ve got FPV units, they have far more ISR (intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition) units, although, obviously, Ukraine has had success countering them. They&apos;ve improved and modernized many of the missiles, such as KH-101s and Iskander-Ms. Their long-range missile strikes, they&apos;ve improved the tactics behind it. They do adapt. We shouldn&apos;t say that they don&apos;t. Russian EW (electronic warfare), depending on who you talk to, is still quite effective. And they have some other supporting capabilities that have gotten effective. And Russian air defenses are not as effective as the air defense systems we&apos;ve seen in this war, but they still do shoot down a lot of missiles. They have shot down plenty of Storm Shadows and ATACMS. Obviously, these UAV attacks Ukraine conducts on Russia, most UAVs get shot down, although still, if a few get through, that&apos;s often enough. The Kyiv Independent: There is a prospect of the U.S. really abandoning Ukraine in terms of military aid, and then there are other more political questions like intelligence and Starlink. How bad could it be for Ukraine if that&apos;s cut off? Rob Lee: The short answer is I don&apos;t know. I think there are different scenarios. One is where the U.S. does not pass an aid package, but they are open to Europe purchasing U.S. weapons or ammunition to form military sales for Ukraine, in which case, that could potentially supplant this, and Europe is still a very rich group, they still have plenty of money, and if they tap into Russian currency reserves, that is another option. At the same time, if the U.S. does not pass an aid package, then the artillery expenditure rate for Ukraine is going to go down. Instead of 2 to 1, if it&apos;s 3 to 1, 4 to 1, what that means in the front line is that more Ukrainian soldiers will die, on a very basic level. It doesn&apos;t necessarily mean it will be decisive, but it will become more difficult for Ukraine to fight. There are other systems that I believe only the U.S. produces, like the interceptors for Patriots, munitions for HIMARS, I&apos;m sure there are a variety of other things, too, like Stingers, Javelins. Some of those things will be really critical. HIMARS fills a very critical role in the Ukrainian military for operational-level fire. There&apos;s nothing else that replaces it. And then Patriot interceptors &#x2013; Patriot is the main anti-ballistic missile defense system for Ukraine. And that is what is protecting Kyiv and all other cities from ballistic missile threats. Ukraine has the ability to shoot down cruise missiles pretty effectively. We know they can shoot down Shaheds and other UAVs very effectively. But ballistic missiles, the options aren&apos;t as great. If you lose this kind of ballistic missile defense, then that could be a key issue. Russia might go after defense industrial factories again or go after the energy grid more successfully. And that could pose significant issues. So it won&apos;t be a complete breakdown, but a loss of U.S. aid could have significant effects. Starlink, obviously, plays a really important role in communications, in integrating the UAV systems. If the U.S. not only stops providing aid but also refuses to allow Europe to buy munitions, that could have a really significant effect, particularly because we know Ukraine already has a manpower problem, and that would compound the issues Ukraine faces.

(Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: Russia&apos;s going forward and they are advancing, there&apos;s no real reason for them to be interested in stopping the war, and I think that&apos;s always the key question about a negotiated peace. So if we&apos;re looking first and foremost at the battlefield beyond grand geopolitics, what would it take for Russia to feel at this point that they just can&apos;t go any further forward and they&apos;re happy to take what they have? Rob Lee: For this war to end, it begins with Russia not being able to advance on the battlefield. As I said before, the minimum objectives that Russia has are to take control of all four of those oblasts, which Russia only partially controls right now. Russia, at this rate, is quite far from achieving that. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s likely that Russia would take all of Donetsk Oblast this year, unless there&apos;s a kind of catastrophic breakdown of Ukrainian forces. And again, it comes back to the U.S. aid and other factors. And so for Russia, as long as they&apos;re advancing on the battlefield, and they have not achieved taking all of Donetsk Oblast, I think the war is going to continue. Peace negotiations can go on, but the gap there is too significant, and I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any chance that President Zelensky is going to give up territory that Ukraine currently controls. I just don&apos;t think that is politically palatable, and I don&apos;t think Ukrainians would allow it. So right now, we have a gap between the Russian demands and the Ukrainian version of what they would be willing to accept as the end of the war. The other big factor here is that how the war ends is really critical. There&apos;s a reason why Ukraine keeps asking for security guarantees, because &#x2013; people talk that Ukraine is tired of this war, exhausted, and that&apos;s true &#x2013; but I think my sense is that what Ukraine is really tired of is this persistent threat from Russia. This threat has been going on for quite a long time, the war began 11 years ago, and for Ukraine, it&apos;s important that however the war ends, that it ends and does not begin again. There&apos;s a chance that if the Trump administration offers concessions that are outside of Ukraine, such as about the security architecture of Europe, maybe that will allow Russia to end the war on different terms in Ukraine because that would be a significant victory for Russia. This war is in part about changing the security architecture of Europe. It&apos;s not just about Ukraine. We saw the demands that Russia made back in December 2021 about going back to what the NATO borders looked like in 1997 and so on. I think Russia still wants that, and they&apos;re still talking about that publicly. My view is that this war is going to continue. It will likely continue as of this summer. Maybe we&apos;ll see a ceasefire, but not necessarily a permanent ceasefire because Russia has not achieved even its minimum objectives in the war. It has not been a success for Russia, it&apos;s come at a high cost, and even though Putin has very strong control of Russia, can he sell what he&apos;s achieved so far as a victory to the Russian people? I&apos;m not sure he can because he really hasn&apos;t succeeded, and the costs have been quite significant. So, unfortunately, I think the war is probably going to continue. We&apos;ll see how the U.S. responds because I think negotiations are going to be more difficult than maybe some U.S. officials currently imagine. The way to end this war is to prevent Russia from advancing on the battlefield, to get to a point where Russia can&apos;t have success. But as long as Russia advances on the battlefield, it&apos;s going to continue. And for the U.S., the best ability to affect that is to continue providing greater aid because then that will enable Ukraine to stop Russian advances.	https://kyivindependent.com/despite-negotiations-buzz-russias-war-is-likely-to-continue-says-military-analyst-rob-lee/	2025-02-27T09:14:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199653261.jpg
What the US-Ukraine mineral deal actually means	As Kyiv and Washington celebrate agreeing to jointly develop Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources after weeks of tense negotiations, the deal still has a long way to go before the money starts flowing. Officials, experts, and those close to the deal say the current version of the agreement is an improvement to earlier drafts. But they caution this is just the first step to more negotiations rather than a concrete deal. And with no signatures yet on paper, things could change in the coming days. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s definitely much better compared to what we saw before. I don&#x2019;t see any traps, but we need to reach a final conclusion,&#x201D; Oleksandr Merezhko, an MP, told the Kyiv Independent. After weeks of back and forth, Kyiv and Washington agreed on a deal on Feb. 25. A final draft of the agreement dropped Ukraine&#x2019;s major objections, including a demand for Kyiv to fill a $500 billion reconstruction fund and a 2:1 investment clause for Kyiv to double the aid given by the U.S. The agreement would create a reconstruction fund to be jointly managed by Kyiv and Washington. Ukrainian state-owned enterprises involved in mineral deposits, oil, gas, and hydrocarbons, as well as infrastructure like liquified natural gas terminals and ports, would contribute 50% of their future revenue to the fund. The contributions would then be invested in Ukraine at least annually with the goal of encouraging foreign investment into the country&#x2019;s natural resources. Just the publicity around the fund will bring Ukraine to the attention of average U.S. investors, said Serhii Fursa, deputy managing director at investment firm Dragon Capital. The current draft of the agreement reads more like a memorandum of understanding than an international treaty, said Merezhko, meaning it is neither politically binding nor requires ratification by Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament. A second &#x201C;Fund Agreement&#x201D; mentioned in the draft deal that is set to be negotiated next will require parliamentary approval. At this point, the agreement is &#x201C;mainly symbolic&#x201D; to show that Kyiv and Washington remain committed to &#x201C;achieving common goals,&#x201D; said Edward Chow, a non-resident senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But without the most basic elements and clarity on how the fund will work, there is a risk that &#x201C;it sets up expectations that may be dashed,&#x201D; he added. President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump could sign the agreement in Washington on Feb. 28. While the deal doesn&#x2019;t contain the security guarantees Kyiv was hoping for, the very presence of American assets in Ukraine is seen as a way to potentially encourage the U.S. to invest in Ukraine&#x2019;s defense. &#x201C;Americans tend to defend more those countries where they have investments, where they have economic interests,&#x201D; said Merezhko. &#x201C;The more American and European companies we have in Ukraine, the better for our economy and our security.&#x201D; American involvement in state-owned enterprises, of which there are over 3,000 in Ukraine, could lead to better governance, said Andy Hunder, head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine. A terrikon rises near a coal mine in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on Feb. 22, 2025. (Pierre Crom/Getty Images)&#x201C;If you have the right management, you could see many of these state-owned enterprises showing good results,&#x201D; he told the Kyiv Independent. The current agreement says that the revenues will not come from state enterprises that are &#x201C;already part of the general budget revenues,&#x201D; meaning big taxpayers like oil and gas giant Naftogaz are excluded. The agreement also notes that the U.S. and Ukraine want to ensure that adversarial countries &#x201C;do not benefit from the reconstruction&#x201D; process after a peace agreement. With the White House not wanting Ukraine to fall into the orbit of its economic rival, Beijing, Merezhko believes the clause could be a &#x201C;hint at China.&#x201D;The U.S. is trying to peel Russia away from China&#x2019;s grip, with State Secretary Marco Rubio saying Moscow can&#x2019;t become Beiijing&#x2019;s &#x201C;junior partner,&#x201D; in an interview with media outlet Breitbart. During a press briefing on Jan. 26, Zelensky stressed the importance of the fund being &#xA0;Ukrainian-American rather than not simply controlled by the U.S., as in the previous proposal. He added that the absence of debt and the removal of the 2:1 investment clause were &#x201C;particularly important.&#x201D; The Ukrainian government will no longer have to pay two dollars for every dollar given by the White House under the current agreement. &#x201C;The most risky factors are off the table,&#x201D; Fursa told the Kyiv Independent. In his opinion, the current deal is on &#x201C;much more acceptable terms&#x201D; as it removes the demand Ukraine pay back U.S. aid provided to Kyiv. If the reconstruction fund is done right, it could help funnel much-needed capital into Ukraine and open the country up to U.S. investors. The issue now is what exactly will be agreed upon once the two sides get into the weeds of it. The current agreement does not explain how the fund will be managed as this will be established in the subsequent fund agreement. &#x201C;We all pretty much have an understanding of what we want the fund to do. We want this to generate cash to fill the American and Ukrainian state coffers,&#x201D; Hunder said. Yet questions remain about under what jurisdiction the fund will be registered, its size, and its timeframe as there&#x2019;s no set end date. Moreover, Ukraine&#x2019;s tax laws need to be changed to redirect the cash flow from the state budget to the fund. The fund itself may not actually come to fruition, said Fursa. He doesn&#x2019;t see enough revenue from Ukraine to make it work while the U.S. government hasn&#x2019;t agreed to invest into it either.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)Trump likely imagines private American companies will come into Ukraine and get first pick on investment projects. Ukraine initially offered up its critical mineral deposits to Trump, promising to have trillions of dollars worth of raw materials buried in its subsoil. Ukraine&#x2019;s underinvested mining sector was hopeful that a deal could bring American capital, technology, and innovation. With the current agreement encompassing all natural resources, including the more lucrative oil and gas sectors, critical minerals have become less relevant. The agreement&#x2019;s lack of secure investment guarantees into mineral mining concerns George Popov, a research analyst at the National Association of Extractive Industry of Ukraine. &#x201C;As an extractive industries association, we would like to see real guarantees of development in the mineral sector in Ukraine. Like exporting resources, developing infrastructure, or even geological investigations here made by the United States,&#x201D; he said. Focusing on new deposits rather than the current mines would be a positive step, as would privatizing some of the mining companies, said Volodymyr Landa, a senior economist at the Kyiv-based Center for Economic Strategy. &#x201C;A lot of resources that are economically feasible to mine are already mined. There are probably some cases in which we are mining some unfeasible resources,&#x201D; he said. But for any investment there needs to be a &#x201C;long and lasting peace,&#x201D; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/first-we-need-peace-us-ukraine-minerals-deal-first-step-on-long-road-to-investment/	2025-02-27T08:37:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201331167.jpg
Turkey considers sending peacekeepers to Ukraine, Bloomberg reports	Turkey has indicated its openness to deploying troops in Ukraine as part of a potential peacekeeping force, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 27, citing sources familiar with the matter. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan discussed the possibility with President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov during separate meetings in Ankara earlier in February, according to Bloomberg. Moscow has publicly opposed NATO troops in Ukraine, but Russia has not given Turkey a concrete response on the proposal, Bloomberg reported. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 20 that Russia was concerned about NATO countries discussing a potential deployment of peacekeepers. Sources told Bloomberg that Turkey would not participate unless it is directly involved in all consultations and preparations for such a mission. The idea of a multinational peacekeeping force has been floated as a potential security guarantee for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. While Washington has supported the concept, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Feb. 12 that such a mission would not include U.S. troops and should be led by European and non-European allies. France, the U.K., and several other countries have expressed support for a peacekeeping force, but European nations have yet to reach a consensus.	https://kyivindependent.com/turkey-considers-sending-troops-to-ukraine-as-part-of-peacekeeping-force-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-27T08:20:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-18-at-4.45.24-PM.png
Russia seized boats, harassed volunteers, concealed gravesites ― Kakhovka Dam explosion investigation	Russian-controlled forces in Kherson Oblast have deliberately made it harder for civilians to evacuate the flood zone following the Russian destruction of the Kakhovka Dam in June 2023. According to an investigation by the Kyiv Independent, the Russian military interfered with the work of locals who were evacuating people from the flooded areas on their own &#x2014; their boats were confiscated, while the volunteers were threatened and forced to stop the efforts. In turn, the local rescue services, working under occupation, did not have enough resources for the evacuation, while the occupation authorities deliberately concealed the magnitude of the disaster. As a result of these actions, civilians on the occupied east bank of Kherson Oblast that could have been rescued have died. The Kyiv Independent&apos;s War Crimes Investigation Unit recorded fifty testimonies from eyewitnesses, relatives of eyewitnesses, and volunteers who stayed in the occupied territories during the flooding following the Kakhovka Dam explosion and were involved in rescuing people. The testimonies laid the basis for the Kyiv Independent&apos;s investigative documentary, When the Water Screams, which premiered on Feb. 27. Following the explosion, the water from the Kakhovka Reservoir began to flood settlements located downstream. On the Ukrainian-controlled part of Kherson Oblast, an immediate evacuation took place, including from the regional capital of Kherson, which saw several neighborhoods being flooded. The Russian-occupied eastern bank of the Dnipro River, however, had been hit the hardest. The witnesses told the Kyiv Independent that they didn&apos;t hear announcements about an evacuation. Boats carrying rescuers from the Russian-controlled emergency services did not appear until several days after the explosion. The evacuation of civilians fell on the shoulders of the locals, who organized and coordinated the rescue themselves, in particular, via a Telegram chat. Yet, Russian soldiers did not allow volunteers to enter all the flooded areas, and confiscated their boats under threat of punishment. The Kyiv Independent identified a man from the east bank involved in the rescue operation, who went missing. Volodymyr Saldo, the Russian-installed head of the occupied part of Kherson Oblast, put Andrey Alekseenko, the so-called head of the government of the occupied eastern bank, in charge of the emergency response. Alekseenko is the former mayor of Krasnodar, a Russian city. At the time of the explosion, the local rescue service was headed by Ivan Pavlienko &#x2014; a Russian Major General. Pavlienko, who had vast experience in dealing with emergency situations in Russia, was in charge of the utility services set to deal with the flooding. However, the resources Russia allocated to combat the disaster were inadequate. In Russia&apos;s Ivanovo Oblast, which is almost the same size as the occupied part of Ukraine&apos;s Kherson Oblast, there were eight times more personnel and 18 times more &quot;special equipment.&quot; A year after the Kakhovka Dam explosion, Russian-controlled official Saldo reported that over 60 people died due to the flooding. According to eyewitnesses and volunteers involved in the evacuation, hundreds of people may have died on the occupied eastern bank of Kherson Oblast, and the authorities attempted to conceal the extent of civilian casualties. When the waters rose, doctors at the Oleshky Polyclinic managed to issue six death certificates, after which they were forbidden from issuing such documents. The bodies of the dead were then taken away. The Kyiv Independent recorded five cases in which the relatives of the victims were not informed about the fate of their deceased, and their burial place remains unknown.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-seized-boats-harassed-volunteers-concealed-gravesites-kakhovka-dam-explosion-investigation/	2025-02-27T07:29:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Desktop--1-.png
As ‘negotiations’ weigh Ukraine’s land, the lives lost under Russian occupation are forgotten	For Viktoriia Hrinienkova, life came to a standstill in June 2023. Three of her family members &#x2014; her mother, father, and grandmother &#x2014; died in their own home in Hola Prystan, a Ukrainian town in the Russian-occupied part of Kherson Oblast. They were killed in the aftermath of Russia&#x2019;s destruction of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant&#x2019;s dam. The Russian forces controlling the plant blew up its engine room from the inside on June 6, 2023. The dam&#x2019;s destruction caused severe flooding across dozens of communities in Kherson Oblast. The occupied east bank suffered the most damage, as it was at a lower elevation. Thousands of people still lived there. Viktoriia learned of the explosion from thousands of kilometers away. She and her family had left the occupied territory a few months after the full-scale invasion, but her parents and grandmother refused to leave. Her father had both legs amputated, and her grandmother was nearly blind. They feared they wouldn&#x2019;t be able to handle the move to another country and adjust to an unfamiliar place. From the day of the explosion onward, Viktoriia clung to her phone, desperate for any updates. She stayed in contact with her mother while frantically searching for someone who could rescue her family. She could hear the water rising inside her parents&#x2019; house &#x2014; but she could do nothing. Rescue services in the occupied territory ignored her pleas for help. &#x201C;My mom called and said, &#x2018;The water has entered the house. It&#x2019;s up to our knees. Now we&#x2019;re sitting on the table. Now we&#x2019;re on chairs on top of the table. The water is up to our waists. We&#x2019;re up to our necks in water,&#x2019;&#x201D; Viktoriia told me. The day after the dam&#x2019;s destruction Viktoriia learned that a boat carrying local residents had reached her family&#x2019;s house. They heard her family shouting for help. But they couldn&#x2019;t take them &#x2014; the boat was already full. After that, Viktoriia&#x2019;s mother stopped answering her phone. Presumably, it was that day they died. I met Viktoriia in her new home in the Czech Republic almost a year and a half after the tragedy. We spoke for nearly an entire day. It was clear how deeply her loss had affected her &#x2014; how raw the wound still was and how unbearable it was for her to accept that her family had died in such a cruel way. Among its many methods of warfare, Russia chooses the most ruthless. As it captures Ukrainian cities and villages, it shows no regard for civilians. Human rights investigators who examined the dam explosion found the same patterns of violations and crimes that the Russian military committed in Mariupol, Bucha, and other occupied cities. People were denied safe evacuation, subjected to filtration procedures, and left without access to drinking water and food. My conversations with witnesses as part of the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s War Crimes Investigation Unit&#x2019;s new documentary confirm this. Over six months of investigation, I spoke with 50 eyewitnesses, relatives of victims, and volunteers who rescued people from the east bank of Kherson Oblast. One question haunted me &#x2014; if Russia planned and carried out the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, why did it do nothing to evacuate civilians from the flooded areas? Under international humanitarian law, the occupying authorities are responsible for ensuring the safety of people under their control. Yet in the first days after the dam&#x2019;s destruction, local occupation officials denied the scale of the disaster, claiming there was no need for evacuations. Witnesses told me they saw Russian emergency services only days after the explosion &#x2014; by then, the water had already peaked. And when locals took it upon themselves to rescue neighbors from rooftops, they faced obstacles. Russian soldiers seized their boats, chased them down, and threatened them. Some families still don&#x2019;t know where their loved ones are buried. There is evidence suggesting that occupation officials deliberately concealed the true death toll. They reportedly forbade local doctors from issuing death certificates, took control of documentation for the deceased, and transported bodies to unknown locations. It is possible that many of the drowned were buried in mass graves. Viktoriia showed me a photo of her parents on her phone &#x2014; a beautiful mother standing among roses, a smiling father, and a grandmother in the backyard of their home. The next photos were of their graves. They are buried in a cemetery in a town 90 kilometers from their home. A relative of Viktoriia&#x2019;s found and identified their bodies there. Viktoriia hopes to one day return to Kherson Oblast to rebury her family. I was conducting my final interviews for this investigation as the U.S. election campaign was heating up and the first reports surfaced about possible negotiations with Russia &#x2014; about the idea of surrendering occupied territories in exchange for peace. The publication of this article comes at one of the most uncertain moments for Ukraine and the world. The aggressor is being given a human face, and justice is slipping further and further away. These days, I can&#x2019;t stop thinking about Viktoriia and her family. Will she ever be able to visit her parents&#x2019; graves? Will those responsible for their brutal deaths ever be held accountable? Peace will not come until evil is punished.

Zelensky meets Irish prime minister ahead of Washington visit	President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin on Feb. 27 at Shannon International Airport in County Clare, Ireland. Zelensky&apos;s visit to Ireland comes before his planned talks with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Feb. 28, where he is expected to sign a minerals agreement with the U.S. The president thanked Ireland for its support of Ukrainians who fled Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The country has taken in nearly 100,000 Ukrainian refugees since 2022. &#x2066;@MichealMartinTD&#x2069; meets Pres Zelensky &#x2066;@ShannonAirport&#x2069; he&#x2019;s very happy to land &amp; meet Taoiseach &amp; thank him for his support &amp; Irelands support for Ukrainian citizens here &#x2066;@rtenews&#x2069; pic.twitter.com/ITFDG1x7Lt Speaking after the meeting, Martin said Zelensky was &quot;very thankful to the people of Ireland for our sustained support for the people of Ukraine.&quot; &quot;We discussed how, together with the EU, we can advance a just, sustainable, and durable peace in Ukraine,&quot; Martin added. While Ireland maintains a policy of military neutrality and is not a NATO member, Dublin has provided over 380 million euros ($420 million) in humanitarian, economic, and non-lethal defense support to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-irish-pm-martin-in-shannon-ahead-of-washington-trip/	2025-02-27T07:07:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GkzUJGDWwAAeChO.jpeg
Russian troops 'bogged down' near Pokrovsk, Ukrainian military claims	Russian troops have been bogged down near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, Viktor Trehubov, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty on Feb. 27. The embattled town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast is among the most hotly contested areas of the front. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi previously claimed that 7,000 Russian soldiers were killed near Pokrovsk in January alone. Ukrainian forces repelled 33 Russian attacks in the Pokrovsk sector over the past day, the General Staff said in its latest update. According to Trehubov, Russia&apos;s offensive from the south and an attempt to bypass Pokrovsk from the west failed. The spokesperson claimed that Russian forces deployed in the area are becoming exhausted. &quot;I am not saying that Ukrainian forces caught some second, third, or 100th and 500th breath... But Russian troops have indeed begun to show some physical, moral, and material exhaustion,&quot; Trehubov said. The spokesperson attributed the situation&apos;s improvement mainly to Ukrainian drone units, which established &quot;effective defense&quot; and cooperated with the infantry. He said that after the start of U.S.-Russian negotiations, Russian soldiers&apos; motivation to fight decreased in the sector where the Khortytsia group of forces operates. A day before, the 25th Separate Airborne Brigade reported that Ukrainian troops had regained control of the village of Kotlyne, near Pokrovsk. Kotlyne and Pokrovsk are connected by the T 0406 highway, which also leads to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-bogged-down-near-pokrovsk-ukrainian-military-claims/	2025-02-27T06:04:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184404872.jpg
First contacts with Trump administration 'inspire certain hopes,' Putin says	Moscow and Washington are ready to re-establish cooperation, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Feb. 27 during a meeting of the Federal Security Service&apos;s (FSB) board, praising the Trump administration for its &quot;pragmatism.&quot; In recent days, the Trump administration has upended years of U.S. foreign policy towards Russia and Ukraine. U.S. and Russian officials resumed high-level bilateral contacts, holding meetings in Riyadh on Feb. 18 and Istanbul on Feb. 27. Speaking as the Russian delegates were concluding their talks in Turkey, Putin described the first contacts between Russia and the U.S. as &quot;inspiring certain hopes.&quot; He also claimed that some Western countries are dissatisfied with the restoration of Russian-American relations and want to &quot;create instability in the world.&quot; &quot;These forces will try to disrupt or compromise the dialogue that has begun,&quot; Putin said, without providing any evidence. &quot;We need to take it into account and use all the means of diplomacy and intelligence services to disrupt such attempts.&quot; Ukraine has been excluded from the talks in Saudi Arabia, sparking concerns that the Trump administration seeks to sideline Kyiv. The subsequent talks in Istanbul were allegedly focused on embassy operations and did not concern the Russia-Ukraine war. During the talks in Riyadh, Moscow allegedly demanded that the U.S. withdraw NATO forces from eastern Europe as a condition for &quot;normalizing relations,&quot; the Financial Times reported, citing two officials in the region. The U.S. delegation reportedly rejected the demand, but concerns remain over what concessions President Donald Trump might consider to secure a deal with Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that he wants European allies to be involved in peace negotiations. Kyiv insists that no talks about Ukraine and ending Russia&apos;s war should be held without Ukraine. Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, said that Europe will not be directly involved in negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, but its interests will be considered.	https://kyivindependent.com/first-contacts-with-trump-administration-inspire-certain-hopes-putin-says/	2025-02-27T05:43:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200258270.jpg
France has led talks on Ukraine's minerals since October 2024, French minister says	France and Ukraine have been discussing the use of Ukrainian minerals for the purposes of the French defense industry since October 2024, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said, as France Info reported on Feb. 27. The comments come as the U.S. and Kyiv reached an initial agreement on a deal on the use of Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, including rare earth minerals, oil, and gas. President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to visit Washington on Feb. 28 to discuss the deal and a possible inclusion of security guarantees. Speaking on the 8h30 franceinfo program, Lecornu said that the French leadership has been considering the issue since last fall when Zelensky presented international partnerships on Ukrainian natural resources in his victory plan. &quot;Volodymyr Zelensky and his team saw that this issue of raw materials could be one of the transactional elements with us, to create endurance,&quot; Lecornu said. &quot;So, President Trump did not invent it because it was the Ukrainians themselves who did.&quot; French President Emmanuel Macron instructed Lecornu to enter into bilateral talks with Ukraine on the issue last October to diversify the supply of rare earth minerals for the French defense industry, the minister said. &quot;Our defense industry will need a certain number of key raw materials in our own weapons systems, not for next year, but for the next 30 or 40 years,&quot; Lecornu added. The U.S.-Ukraine deal, finalized on Feb. 25, follows weeks of negotiations that strained relations between Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump. Washington initially proposed three versions, with Kyiv rejecting the first two over the absence of security guarantees. The latest version of the agreement, which the Kyiv Independent obtained, aims to create a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the &quot;future monetization&quot; of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. While it does not contain concrete security guarantees, the agreement states that the U.S. government &quot;supports Ukraine&apos;s efforts to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace.&quot; The AFP news agency reported earlier this week that the EU had proposed its own version of a deal on minerals that is &quot;mutually beneficial.&quot; Soon after, the European Commission denied any such proposal.	https://kyivindependent.com/france-has-led-talks-with-ukraine-on-minerals-since-october-2024-minister-says/	2025-02-27T05:14:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1695287073.jpg
Russia claims to recapture village north of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast	Russian troops recaptured the village of Nikolsky in embattled Kursk Oblast, some 42 kilometers (26 miles) north of the Ukrainian-occupied town of Sudzha, Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Feb. 27. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, senior Russian General Staff officer Sergei Rudsky said earlier in February. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claims that its troops continue to advance and push Ukrainian forces out of the salient. Kyiv has not commented on purportedly lost settlements in Kursk Oblast. According to Rudsky, Ukrainian soldiers control about 500 square kilometers (193 square miles) out of 1,268 square kilometers (490 square miles) initially seized by Kyiv. Russian casualties have reached nearly 40,000 in Kursk Oblast, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 6. Another 909 have been reportedly taken as prisoners of war. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Ukraine likely seeks to use its foothold in Kursk Oblast as leverage in potential peace talks. Russia&apos;s forces in Kursk Oblast have been bolstered by North Korean troops, deployed last fall to help counter the Ukrainian incursion. President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that the offensive disrupted Russia&apos;s ability to carry out large-scale operations in northeastern and southern Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-to-recapture-village-north-of-sudzha-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-02-27T04:42:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2166312567.jpg
Revolut operating illegally in Ukraine without required license, National Bank says	London-based digital bank Revolut has not obtained the required license to conduct banking activities in Ukraine, &#xA0;the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) said in a press release on Feb. 27. According to Ukrainian banking law, a foreign bank can only operate in Ukraine if it opens a local branch or obtains a banking license. This process must first be approved by the NBU, the bank said in the press release. Revolut officially launched its services in Ukraine on Feb. 11, offering Ukrainian residents access to features like instant, free transfers between app users by setting up a European Revolut account. Revolut said its services for Ukrainian residents were provided by Revolut Bank UAB, a Lithuania-based bank supervised by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Lithuania. The NBU argues that while this license allows Revolut to operate in EU countries, the fintech company has not applied for a license to operate in Ukraine as required by law. &quot;We support open competition and financial technology development, but all market players must follow legal and regulatory requirements,&quot; the NBU wrote. The Ukrainian regulator also warned that Revolut customers in Ukraine will not be protected by local laws on financial consumer rights or deposit guarantees. Revolut is a British multinational neobank and fintech company, co-founded by Ukrainian tech entrepreneur Vlad Yatsenko and Russian-born Nikolai Storonsky, who renounced his Russian citizenship after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The company has also stopped all operations in Russia and Belarus.	https://kyivindependent.com/revolut-operating-illegally-in-ukraine-without-required-license-national-bank-says/	2025-02-27T04:31:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-11-at-6_14_44-PM.png
Russia to lose 'chance for world leadership' if it doesn't get out of war by 2026, Budanov says	Russia may lose its chance for world leadership if it does not halt its full-scale war against Ukraine by 2026, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) head Kyrylo Budanov said in an interview with Ukrinform published on Feb. 27. Earlier this month, Budanov said he believes that Ukraine and Russia will reach a ceasefire this year. His comments come as U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed to mediate a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia while using increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Kyiv. Asked whether the Kremlin wants to make a peace deal now to build up its strength, Budanov agreed, saying that Russia needs a break. &quot;According to their (Russia&apos;s) strategy, if they don&apos;t get out of this war by 2026, they lose even a chance for world leadership. They will be left with a maximum level of regional leadership, which they are absolutely not satisfied with,&quot; the spy chief said. According to Budanov, the financial cost of the war is &quot;too high&quot; for Moscow, which prevents it from focusing on development and large-scale projects. Russia has problems with its economy, but it will be able to &quot;balance&quot; it out as long as it has oil, gas, and precious metals, he added. &quot;There is a lack of technologies, technological solutions that are not available in Russia, primarily for the development of the Arctic region, gas production, etc.,&quot; Budanov said. Throughout the three years of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine&apos;s Western partners imposed heavy sanctions on Moscow to undermine its ability to wage war. Initially, Russia has largely weathered the sanctions, circumventing economic restrictions through third-party countries and various loopholes. The situation appears to be shifting as Russia has faced mounting economic challenges over the past months, compounded by labor shortages and military spending-induced inflation that led to record interest rates. In the fall of 2023, Budanov said that Russia likely has the economic and technical capacity to continue its war against Ukraine until 2025 or 2026. In office since 2020, Budanov has at times made radical predictions about the full-scale war that have not always come true.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-to-lose-chance-for-world-leadership-if-it-doesnt-get-out-of-war-by-2026-budanov-says/	2025-02-27T04:24:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201657947.jpg
US-Russia talks in Istanbul meant to 'strengthen trust,' first of many, Moscow says	Russia hopes the meeting with U.S. officials in Istanbul will &quot;strengthen the trust&quot; between the two countries, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Feb. 27. &quot;We expect that today&apos;s meeting will be first in the series of similar expert consultations that will move us closer, together with the U.S., in overcoming disagreements and strengthening trust,&quot; spokesperson Maria Zakharova said during a press briefing. U.S. and Russian delegations began their meeting in Istanbul earlier on Feb. 27, following up on the initial round of talks in Riyadh on Feb. 18. The meetings come amid U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s efforts to broker a swift peace deal with Russia, speaking concerns that Washington&apos;s partners in Kyiv and Europe are being sidelined in the process. The second meeting will not include discussions on Ukraine, a U.S. State Department spokesperson told the media. According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the deliberations will focus on embassy operations. The discussions would concern &quot;systemic problems that have accumulated as a result of the illegal activities of the previous U.S. administration to create artificial obstacles to the activities of the Russian Embassy,&quot; leading Moscow to &quot;respond in kind,&quot; Lavrov said. The Biden administration has cut most official contacts with Russia after the outbreak of the full-scale war in an attempt to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin on the global stage.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-russian-talks-in-istanbul-meant-to-strengthen-trust-moscow-says/	2025-02-27T04:07:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1237721878.jpg
US 'backstop' necessary for peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, Starmer says ahead of Trump meeting	U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Feb. 26 that a U.S. &quot;backstop&quot; for a potential Europeacekeeper contingent in Ukraine would be necessary to ensure a just and lasting peace, Reuters reported. Starmer is heading to Washington to meet U.S. President Donald Trump and convince him to continue playing a role in Ukraine&apos;s security amid Russian aggression. Recent weeks saw major geopolitical shifts as the Trump administration has adopted more antagonistic rhetoric toward Ukraine and other partners while intensifying diplomatic outreach to Russia in an effort to broker a swift agreement. The U.S. president has avoided making any security commitments to Kyiv and made clear he expects Europe to take up responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s defense. &quot;I&apos;m absolutely convinced that we need a lasting peace, not a ceasefire, and for that to happen, we need security guarantees,&quot; Starmer told journalists during his trip to Washington. The Telegraph previously reported that Starmer aims to present Trump with a plan to deploy up to 30,000 European peacekeepers in Ukraine to monitor a ceasefire. While Trump has backed the idea of a European peacekeeping force, there is no consensus among European partners, and Moscow has rejected it outright. The British prime minister reiterated that the U.K. is ready to take part in the mission but added that a U.S. &quot;backstop&quot; would be essential for such a plan, without elaborating on what concrete measures he expects from Washington. Starmer&apos;s visit follows that of French President Emmanuel Macron, who also sought to convince Trump to remain engaged in Ukraine. Macron has reportedly failed to receive any clear commitments about a U.S. backstop, with an undisclosed EU official describing the trip as a &quot;waste of time&quot; in comments for Politico.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-backstop-necessary-for-lasting-peace-in-ukraine-starmer-says-ahead-of-meeting-trump/	2025-02-27T03:36:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2159996904.jpg
Zelensky invited to special EU summit on defense, Ukraine next week	President Volodymyr Zelensky has been invited to a special EU summit on March 6 that will be dedicated to &quot;European defense and Ukraine,&quot; European Council President Antonio Costa said in an open letter dated Feb. 26. The agenda for the meeting aims to make &quot;first decisions for the short-term&quot; that will enable Europe &quot;to become more sovereign, more capable and better equipped,&quot; Costa said. The official added that a &quot;major aim&quot; of the summit is to prepare EU countries for &quot;the possible European contribution to the security guarantees that will be necessary to ensure a lasting peace in Ukraine.&quot; The summit comes amid major shifts in U.S.-European relations, with U.S. President Donald Trump sending clear signals that the U.S. expects the continent to take a larger role in the defense of Ukraine against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The recent mineral deal negotiated between the U.S. and Ukraine does not contain specific security guarantees, with Zelensky on Feb. 26 saying they will be discussed in future negotiations. &quot;The EU and its member states are ready to take more responsibility for Europe&apos;s security,&quot; Costa said. &quot;I have invited President Zelensky to come to Brussels on the occasion of the meeting of the European Council to discuss with us the latest developments.&quot; Zelensky will visit Washington on Feb. 28 to sign a minerals agreement, Trump said on Feb. 26. He is also scheduled to visit the European Security Summit in the U.K. on March 2.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-invited-to-special-eu-summit-on-ukraine-next-week/	2025-02-27T03:04:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201484066.jpg
MH17 victims' relatives want Russian admission of responsibility for crash to be part of peace deal, media reports	Relatives of the MH17 crash victims insist that Russia&apos;s recognition of responsibility for the downing of the plane should be part of a possible peace deal on ending Moscow&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine, European Pravda reported on Feb. 26, citing obtained copies of letters. The letters were sent to U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen earlier this month, according to the media outlet. Flight MH17 departed from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport en-route to Kuala Lumpur International Airport on July 17, 2014. Three hours into the flight, the Boeing-777 was shot down by Russian proxy forces using a Buk surface-to-air missile above Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk Oblast. All 283 passengers and 15 crew members on board, among them 196 Dutch citizens, were killed. Russia never claimed responsibility for the disaster, instead fanning conspiracy theories to shift the blame elsewhere. The District Court of The Hague in November 2022 sentenced in absentia two Russian nationals and one Ukrainian national to life imprisonment for their involvement in the downing of flight MH17. A fourth defendant, also a Russian national, was acquitted on the grounds of insufficient evidence connecting him to the crime. Relatives of the victims have long urged Russia to admit its responsibility and investigate all those involved and the causes of the downing. Now, they want their demands to be included in any potential peace pact. According to the relatives, a credible agreement is difficult without Russia recognizing its responsibility for the downing. &quot;Without this (Russia&apos;s recognition of the downing of MH17), there can be no lasting peace with Russia,&quot; the letter read. Copies of the letters were also reportedly sent to Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof and the EU&apos;s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas.	https://kyivindependent.com/mh17-victims-relatives-demand-russian-admission-of-responsibility-for-crash-to-be-part-of-peace-deal/	2025-02-27T03:00:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1233114049.jpg
EU in talks on mobilizing 'hundreds of billions' for defense after Trump's foreign policy shift, Bloomberg reports	EU officials are discussing ways to mobilize hundreds of billions of euros for defense spending amid the U.S.&apos;s foreign policy shift away from Europe, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 27, citing undisclosed officials. U.S. Donald Trump has said he expects Europe to take responsibility for its own security, leading some to doubt his commitment to NATO and mutual defense. This led to calls for a rapid increase in defense spending across the continent as Russia continues to wage its full-scale war against Ukraine, the largest conflict in Europe since World War II. The EU faces major challenges in this effort, namely an undersized defense industry and empty stocks after delivering billions in arms and ammunition to Ukraine, Bloomberg reported. To address the issue, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen proposed a three-step plan to ramp up defense spending, officials told the outlet. This reportedly includes allowing member states to spend more by loosening fiscal rules &#x2013; potentially freeing up at least 160 billion euros ($168 billion) &#x2013; creating a joint EU instrument for defense investment, and loosening investment constraints on the European Investment Bank. Separately, von der Leyen also reportedly proposed redirecting the largely unused 392-billion-euro ($410 billion) Covid recovery fund to finance defense projects, Bloomberg wrote. EU officials are expected to discuss joint security during an emergency meeting on March 6, with the new defense industrial strategy to be unveiled on March 16. Individual European countries are also taking steps to boost defense spending. Germany&apos;s incoming leaders are reportedly in talks on a special defense spending fund of 200 billion euros ($210 billion). Outside the EU, the U.K. has committed to raising defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by April 2027.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-in-talks-for-freeing-up-massive-defense-spending-after-trumps-shift-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-27T02:50:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1997776047.jpg
Culture Ministry to suspend issuing permits for journalists, artists to travel abroad	The Culture Ministry will temporarily halt issuing permits for draft-age male journalists and culture professionals to travel abroad pending a legislative review, the ministry said on Feb. 26. The measure, which will take effect on March 3, comes in response to cases in which men used their permits to stay abroad longer than permitted. Men aged 18-60 are not permitted to travel abroad under martial law, instituted at the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, without special permission. Journalists and culture workers were allowed to travel abroad temporarily for professional purposes, provided they had the necessary documentation and permits. Multiple abuses of this rule were reported throughout the full-scale war, with men staying abroad beyond the permitted period or indefinitely. In response, the Culture Ministry submitted a draft amendment to regulate the requirements for granting permits. The suspension will be in place until the &quot;legal settlement of this issue,&quot; the ministry said. Manpower shortage has been described as a key challenge for the Ukrainian Armed Forces as the full-scale war with Russia entered its fourth year. Thousands of draft-age men have crossed or sought to cross the border illegally to avoid mobilization, deepening the crisis.	https://kyivindependent.com/culture-ministry-to-suspend-issuing-permits-to-journalists-artists-for-travel-abroad/	2025-02-27T02:01:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2190384600.jpg
US, Russia reportedly discuss Arctic cooperation as Trump seeks to pull Moscow from Beijing	American and Russian officials have identified the Arctic as a possible area of economic cooperation, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 26, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. U.S. President Donald Trump said that Washington and Moscow are discussing economic agreements, with his administration adopting a more amicable stance toward Russia than his predecessor, Joe Biden. Moscow is offering the Trump administration a deal on Russian natural resources and access to the Arctic, said Kirill Dmitriev, one of the Russian delegates in recent U.S.-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia. The news comes as U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the Trump administration is seeking to disengage Russia from China. China has remained a key ally of Russia throughout the full-scale invasion, deepening economic ties and becoming Moscow&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods &#x2014; equipment the Russian military uses in its war against Ukraine. In an interview with Breitbart News published on Feb. 26, Rubio said he did not know if it would ever be possible to completely peel Moscow off of relations with Beijing. &quot;I also don&#x2019;t think having China and Russia at each other&#x2019;s neck is good for global stability because they&#x2019;re both nuclear powers,&quot; he added. &quot;But I do think we&#x2019;re in a situation now where the Russians have become increasingly dependent on the Chinese and that&#x2019;s not a good outcome either if you think about it.&quot; Rubio fears that further rapprochement between China and Russia will become a problem for Washington if Moscow turns into Beijing&apos;s &quot;junior partner.&quot; &quot;We could find ourselves in a situation where whether Russia wants to improve its relations with the U.S. or not, they can&#x2019;t because they&#x2019;ve become completely dependent on the Chinese because we have cut them off,&quot; Rubio said. The U.S. secretary of state described the U.S.-China ties as &quot;the big story of the 21st century.&quot; According to him, Washington will have disagreements with Russia and China, but it is important to maintain relations with both. In recent days, the Trump administration has upended years of U.S. foreign policy towards Russia and Ukraine. American and Russian delegations are holding the second round of talks in Istanbul on Feb. 27. The first meeting between the two nations took place in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. No concrete decisions on peace negotiations were announced following the talks in Saudi Arabia, but Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the meeting sparked alarm in Kyiv and Europe. In early February, Trump imposed a 10% tariff on goods from China. Referring to the war in Ukraine, he said China has &quot;a great deal of power over that situation&quot; and that he hoped the U.S. could work with Beijing to end the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-aims-to-peel-russia-off-of-china-us-secretary-of-state-says/	2025-02-27T01:49:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194469087.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 15	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 15 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Feb. 17&#x2013;Feb. 23, 2025. The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Parliament set to vote on new administrative court reform bill in final reading Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, is scheduled to vote on draft law #12368-1 this week in its second and final reading. The legislation proposes establishing a new administrative court to replace the Kyiv District Administrative Court (OASK). However, the bill deviates from International Monetary Fund commitments, as it suggests creating two separate courts instead of a single high administrative court, as outlined in Ukraine&#x2019;s IMF memorandum. Given these discrepancies, the bill&#x2019;s chances of passage remain uncertain. Ukrainian lawmakers introduce bill to overhaul Financial Monitoring Service Ukrainian lawmakers have introduced Bill No. 13029, which aims to establish a transparent selection process for the head of the State Financial Monitoring Service (SFMS) and implement an independent audit of the agency&#x2019;s operations. The proposed legislation includes: The bill also responds to concerns over recent appointments at the SFMS. Just last week, a new deputy head, Bohdan Korolchuk, was appointed without a competition. Korolchuk previously served as first deputy to the new SFMS head at the Poltava Regional Administration and had prior experience in the National Police and the Interior Ministry. (Technology of Progress and research firm Gradus)Customs reform remains a priority for Ukrainian businesses, ToP&apos;s survey finds Customs reform remains a key priority for Ukrainian businesses, with the selection of a new head of the State Customs Service through a transparent process expected by June 2025, in line with Ukraine&#x2019;s IMF commitments. These findings come from a survey conducted by the NGO Technology of Progress and research firm Gradus, which polled 75 owners, executives, and senior managers of medium and large businesses across Ukraine. According to the results, 39% of respondents said the quality of customs services had remained unchanged in 2024, while 17% noted a deterioration in performance.

Ukraine Business Roundup — US, Ukraine agree on minerals deal	The following is the Feb. 25, 2025 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. After weeks of back-and-forth, during which U.S. President Donald Trump lobbed insults at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy, as well as public outcry over leaked details on the deal, Kyiv and Washington have reportedly agreed to a deal on Ukraine&#x2019;s mineral resources, the Financial Times and Ukrainian media outlet Ekonomichna Pravda reported late on Feb. 25 after obtaining access to the deal. Ukrainian officials told the FT that Kyiv is ready to move forward with a deal to develop Ukraine&#x2019;s mineral resources &#x2014; including oil and gas &#x2014; after the U.S. agreed to drop a demand for $500 billion in rights in potential revenue from developing the resources. The deal does not, however, contain any security guarantees for Ukraine &#x2014; a not-so-minor detail that was reportedly the reason why Zelensky refused to sign the first couple of versions of the agreement. The officials say the terms of the agreement are more favorable than the original versions of the deal, and according to the FT, see the deal as an important way to deepen their country&#x2019;s relationship with the U.S. Here&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s reportedly in the final version of the deal: The agreement will establish a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the &quot;future monetization&quot; of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and related logistics. The fund will invest in projects within Ukraine. Interestingly, the deal excludes resources that already contribute to Ukraine&apos;s state budget, meaning it will not cover operations by Naftogaz and Ukrnafta, the country&apos;s largest oil and gas producers. This piece right here caused a lot of alarm when it became known to the public that a deal could possibly include the state-owned oil and gas giants. The updated agreement also removed a provision that would have given the United States 100% control over the fund. The joint ownership of Ukraine and the U.S. over the fund will be calculated according to the countries&apos; actual contributions to it, according to EP. What&#x2019;s next: The agreement still has to be signed by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha. Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament will also have to ratify the deal. Specific details of the agreement will still have to be finalized in future negotiations. Speaking of details, in an op-ed published yesterday, titled &#x201C;Trump&#x2019;s Ukraine rare earths deal: &apos;The art of the steal&#x2019;,&#x201D; Edward C. Chow, non-resident senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, points out that &#x201C;the devil is in the details when assessing how such a deal might work.&#x201D; Firstly, Chow writes, the U.S. doesn&#x2019;t directly invest in mining projects, especially overseas. If the U.S. envisions the American private sector extracting Ukrainian resources, those investments can take five to 10 years to even secure financing. &#x201C;It is difficult to estimate how long this would take in a war-torn country whose territorial integrity is under attack,&#x201D; he writes. (Center for Economic Strategy)Will those who left ever return?The number of refugees who are planning to return to Ukraine after fleeing abroad due to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion continues to decline, according to a new report by the Kyiv-based Center for Economic Strategy. For the first time, the share of refugees planning to come home fell to below half of respondents in a poll conducted by the think tank. &#x201C;Many who previously expressed a definite or likely intention to return have now reconsidered, shifting towards staying abroad,&#x201D; CES wrote in its report. According to CES, the key factors discouraging refugees from returning are ongoing security risks and uncertainty, destroyed housing, low living standards, and challenges in finding employment in Ukraine. If the war does end this year as both President Volodymyr Zelensky and President Donald Trump have said is the goal, attracting Ukrainians back to the country will be crucial to getting Ukraine&#x2019;s economy on stable footing. Himera, the walkie-talkie startup is adding a new encryption layer to protect against future quantum computing threats. Thousands of Ukrainian troops already use Himera, and NATO is taking interest. (Facebook/Himera)Walkie-talkie revolutionOne Ukrainian startup has rebuilt the humble walkie-talkie to weather the waves of modern electronic war with Russia. With thousands of Ukrainian soldiers already using their handheld comms devices, NATO is tuning in, reporter Kollen Post writes in his latest. Himera, the walkie-talkie startup in question, is about to get a new layer of encryption that founder Misha Rudominsky says will guard their devices against the impending arrival of quantum computing on the battlefield &#x2014; a technological threat that is rattling wartime communications experts worldwide. More immediately, $1.2 million in fundraising, active EU manufacturing, U.S. Air Force testing, and a distribution deal with a Canadian firm are putting Himera on the threshold of selling to NATO and the U.S. Defense Department itself.

Ukraine will receive a new tranche of 3.5 billion euros ($3.7 billion) from the European Union in March, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Feb. 24 at the international Support Ukraine summit in Kyiv. In 2025, the EU is expected to provide Ukraine with 35 billion euros ($36 billion) in financial assistance under the G7 Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) credit initiative and the Ukraine Facility program. &quot;Thanks to our Ukraine Facility and the G7 loan, we have closed Ukraine&apos;s budgetary gap for the entire year 2025,&quot; she stressed. Meanwhile, the EU paid more for Russian fossil fuel imports than it gave to Ukraine in financial aid last year. The cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine after three years of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion will be $524 billion over the next decade, the U.N. said on Feb. 25, citing data from Ukraine&apos;s government, the World Bank, the European Commission, and the U.N. The required reconstruction costs are 2.8 times higher than Ukraine&apos;s nominal GDP for 2024. Direct losses in Ukraine reached $176 billion at the end of December 2024 compared to $152 billion in February last year. Educational technology company Headway became the first Ukraine-born business selected to join Endeavor, a global network of entrepreneurs. The membership gives Headway access to Endeavor&apos;s network of 2,800 entrepreneurs and potential funding through Endeavor Catalyst, the organization&apos;s investment fund that can invest up to $2 million in member companies. &quot;This is a powerful signal for Ukrainian startups: Our companies are visible to the whole world and have a great chance of entering global markets,&quot; said Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, noting that Endeavor&apos;s network includes companies like Glovo, Amazon, and Netflix. Ukraine&apos;s State Bureau of Investigation and Justice Ministry are preparing to nationalize Poltava Mining, a subsidiary of London-listed Ferrexpo, which is majority-owned by oligarch Konstantin Zhevago, the SBI announced on Feb. 20. The lawsuit seeks to transfer 49.5% of Poltava Mining and its assets to state ownership, including 541 properties, 172 land plots, and over 2,300 railway cars with tracks. Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) recently announced sanctions and criminal proceedings against a number of Ukrainian businessmen and former high-ranking officials, including Zhevago.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-business-roundup-us-ukraine-agree-on-minerals-deal/	2025-02-27T01:13:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179841418.jpg
Trump admin says it's cutting 90% of USAID foreign aid contracts	The Trump administration said on Feb. 26 that it is terminating over 90% of the U.S. Agency for International Development&apos;s (USAID) foreign aid contracts, cutting $60 billion in foreign assistance, the U.S. media reported. The step comes after U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration halted almost all foreign aid for 90 days for a review amid efforts to shutter the aid agency and merge it under the State Department. The cuts will include 5,800 of 6,200 USAID contracts, purportedly saving $54 billion, and 4,100 of 9,100 State Department grants, for a cut of $4.4 billion, Politico reported. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support to Kyiv. The agency has funded school reconstruction, bomb shelters, critical energy repairs, and civil society initiatives. The fate of the remaining USAID projects is to be determined in ongoing court battles with the administration. The White House has accused the agency of pushing a &quot;liberal agenda&quot; and widespread waste, despite foreign aid making up just 1% of the federal budget. Elon Musk, Trump&apos;s ally who oversees the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has led the charge against USAID, laying off staff and attacking the agency in public, often making baseless or false claims about its work. USAID cuts not only marked a significant realignment of U.S. foreign policy but also threatened various Ukrainian organizations and projects across multiple sectors reliant on U.S. funding. Ukraine is in talks with private and EU partners to replace funding sources for key projects in energy infrastructure, veterans&apos; affairs, and more.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-admin-says-its-cutting-90-of-usaid-foreign-aid-contracts/	2025-02-27T01:09:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2172231465.jpg
Ukraine to receive $730 million for demining equipment from partners by 2034	Western partners are planning to allocate 700 million euros ($732 million) to Kyiv for the purchase of demining equipment by 2034, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry said on Feb. 26. Over 139,300 square kilometers (53,800 square miles) of Ukrainian land are potentially contaminated with explosives as a result of the full-scale war, with clearance efforts expected to take over a decade and cost $35 billion, according to the Economy Ministry. The ministry&apos;s announcement came after the 11th meeting of the demining coalition for Ukraine, which involved 15 countries and was held in Vilnius. The participants prioritized the procurement of equipment and weapons for 2025 with a budget of 130 million euros ($157 million). A total of 51 million euros ($53 million) has already been raised, said Ruslan Berehulia, the head of the mine action department. Ukraine and Lithuania are also planning to set up working groups to study innovations, including the use of drones and artificial intelligence in mine action.Ukraine remains the most mined country in the world. Despite ongoing hostilities, Ukraine has reduced the area considered as potentially hazardous by over 35,000 square kilometers (13,500 square miles). Some 399 civilians have been killed, and 915 have been injured by mines since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, according to U.N. monitors. Multiple countries have been assisting Ukraine with demining efforts and providing training and equipment.	https://kyivindependent.com/demining/	2025-02-27T00:34:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1256100052.jpg
Trump to announce 25% tariffs on EU 'very soon'	U.S. President Donald Trump plans to impose 25% tariffs on imports from the European Union soon, he said during a cabinet meeting on Feb. 26. In early February, Trump placed 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods, albeit postponing their implementation soon after. He also imposed a 10% tariff on goods from China. Trump claimed that the EU was formed &quot;to screw the United States,&quot; criticizing European policies that, according to him, put American food and cars exporters at a disadvantage. &quot;We&apos;ll be announcing it very soon. It&apos;ll be 25% generally speaking, and that will be on cars and all other things,&quot; the U.S. president said. Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order for tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the U.S, prompting the European Commission to threaten retaliatory measures. The tariffs on steel will also affect Ukraine. Steel production is a key sector of Ukraine&apos;s economy, the second-largest source of foreign currency after agriculture. Ukraine&#x2019;s metallurgical products make up 57.9% of Ukraine&apos;s exports to the U.S., or in dollar amounts, $503 million out of $869 million, said Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko. The U.S.-EU dispute over tariffs dates back to Trump&apos;s first term, when his administration imposed duties on nearly $7 billion worth of European steel and aluminum exports in 2018, citing national security concerns. The EU retaliated with tariffs on American goods. A temporary truce was reached in 2021 under the Biden administration, with the U.S. partially lifting the tariffs and replacing them with a quota system. In exchange, the EU froze its countermeasures. Trump&apos;s latest move threatens to reignite the trade dispute. The European Commission argued that such restrictions would disrupt the deeply integrated supply chains between the EU and the U.S., raising costs and harming trade between both regions.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-to-announce-25-tariffs-on-eu-imports-very-soon/	2025-02-27T00:05:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201185317.jpg

Russia's advance slows down in critical areas after Ukraine regrouped, Syrskyi says	Ukraine has regrouped its troops on the battlefield, slowing down Russian forces&apos; advance in the most &quot;threatening areas,&quot; Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Feb. 27. Russian troops are actively pushing on the Novopavlivka sector in eastern Donetsk Oblast, trying to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense and capture three settlements, according to Syrskyi.He did not specify which settlements he meant. The village of Novopavlivka in Donetsk Oblast lies some 5 kilometers (3 miles) north of the embattled city of Pokrovsk, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian troops in the region. The estimated Russian advance near Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, as of Feb. 26, 2025, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)&quot;However, our side has taken a number of measures to improve the interaction of military units and subdivisions, regrouped troops, which slowed down...

According to Syrskyi, Russia continues trying to reach the administrative border of Donetsk Oblast, suffering heavy losses. &quot;The plans remain unfulfilled,&quot; he said.A day before, the 25th Separate Airborne Brigade reported that Ukrainian troops had regained control of the village of Kotlyne, near Pokrovsk. Kotlyne and Pokrovsk are connected by the T 0406 highway, which also leads to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-advance-slowed-in-most-threatening-areas-after-ukraines-regrouping/	2025-02-26T23:05:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2180021053.jpg
Australian philanthropists donate $3.15 million to Ukraine, urge governments to step up support	Minderoo Foundation on Feb. 27 donated 5 million Australian dollars ($3.15 million) to support Ukrainian communities impacted by Russian aggression and affirm Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity. The package builds upon 20 million Australian dollars ($12.6 million) that the Australia-based charity, founded by Andrew and Nicola Forrest, has already provided for demining, food and energy security, and the protection of children in Ukraine. Russia&apos;s full-scale war, which recently entered its fourth year, has sparked a deep humanitarian crisis in the country, leaving millions displaced and housing and infrastructure devastated in front-line regions. &quot;The invasion of one country by another is wholly offensive to civilization. Ukraine has every right to protect its borders, and the international community will be extremely shortsighted if it does not stand with Ukraine,&quot; said Andrew Forrest, an Australian billionaire, philanthropist, and founder of the Fortescue mining group. &quot;While philanthropy can play a crucial role, governments across Europe should redouble their efforts to make Russian assets and elite interests pay for the war of aggression they have waged on Ukraine.&quot; The foundation&apos;s latest assistance package focuses on regions in Ukraine&apos;s east, including Dnipro, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, and elsewhere. It targets communities impacted by Russia&apos;s use of cluster munitions in Mykolaiv in 2022 and Russia&apos;s deadly missile strike against an apartment building in Dnipro in January 2023. The donation will further provide support for demining in agricultural areas, households impacted by the war, and peace-building and community cohesion activities in cooperation with civil society organizations. Nicola Forrest noted that one-quarter of Ukraine&apos;s agricultural land remains contaminated by landmines and unexploded ammunition. &quot;Demining is a humanitarian and economic imperative. Recovery, growth and global food security depends on it,&quot; she said in a statement. The foundation said that the latest donation is intended to recognize Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity and reflects Minderoo&apos;s commitment to the Ukrainian leadership in peace efforts. &quot;President (Volodymyr) Zelensky is the democratically elected leader of his people and a man of great character and resilience,&quot; Andrew Forrest said on the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. &quot;As I have told the president before, we unequivocally support Ukraine to recover from this atrocious war on the terms acceptable to him and his people.&quot; The statement comes amid U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s diplomatic outreach to Russia in an effort to broker a peace deal, seemingly sidestepping Kyiv and Europe. The U.S. president caused an uproar in Ukraine and elsewhere when he called Zelensky a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; and said the Ukrainian head of state is not vital to the peace process.	https://kyivindependent.com/australian-charity-donates-3-million-to-regional-recovery-in-ukraine/	2025-02-26T22:54:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/1c248f5e630b858e5b896ae3512ede97_1708189465_extra_large.jpeg

North Korea deploys additional troops to Russia's Kursk Oblast, South Korean intelligence says	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. North Korea has deployed additional troops to Russia, an official for South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Agency (NIS) claimed on Feb. 27. An official from Seoul&apos;s spy agency told AFP that &quot;some additional troop deployments (are) appearing to have taken place,&quot; into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, adding that other troops had been &quot;redeployed&quot; within the region. No information was immediately available as to how many new troops were being sent into Russia, with the official adding that the &quot;exact scale is still being assessed.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims made by the National Intelligence Agency. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in August 2024. The New York Times reported on Jan. 30 that North Korean troops had been pulled from the front, a Special Operations Forces spokesperson confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that Ukraine&apos;s special forces had not faced Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers for three weeks. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov denied reports that North Korean soldiers have not been seen on the front line for weeks. However, Budanov noted that the number of North Korean troops has decreased, and Ukraine is trying to establish why. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 14 that North Korean troops fighting for Russia against Ukraine have suffered 4,000 casualties, two-thirds of whom have been killed. Zelensky&apos;s claim of the number killed is significantly higher than a Jan. 13 estimate from the NIS which said at least 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and another 2,700 wounded. The heavy losses of the North Korean army may be related to its lack of combat experience and the tactic of human waves attacks with a limited amount of equipment, Budanov said in an interview with The War Zone magazine published on Feb. 4. Amid the gruelling offensive, Ukraine has continued to lose territory initially gained in the surprise Kursk incursion. Russia has claimed to have regained control of about 64% of the territory captured by Ukraine. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-deploys-additional-troops-to-russia-south-korean-intelligence-claims/	2025-02-26T21:06:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157772464.jpg
Finland to provide Ukraine with $691 in military equipment	Finland announced on Feb. 26 that it would provide 660 million euros ($691 million) in military equipment for Ukraine, supplying the embattled country with domestically-produced equipment. The announcement did not provide detail as to what kind of equipment or weaponry the country will provide Ukraine, but will focus &quot;on Ukraine&#x2019;s critical needs,&quot; according to a news release Finland&apos;s Defense Ministry. &quot;The products will be delivered to Ukraine as part of future material aid packages,&quot; the news release added, without specifying a timeline. The announcement marks a shift in how the country delivers weaponry and equipment to Ukraine, having previously donated from the country&apos;s surplus stocks. Under the new framework, Finland will order new military products from domestic defense companies to be sent to Ukraine. &quot;With this new support program, Finnish companies and expertise will play a central role in supporting Ukraine,&quot; the news release read. &quot;These measures will strengthen both Ukraine&apos;s chances for a just peace and the long-term resilience of Finland&#x2019;s security industry and supply chain.&quot; The announcement comes amid new scrutiny surrounding Europe&apos;s role in supporting Ukraine in the wake of shifting U.S. policy towards Russia. European leaders have scrambled to deliver military support to Ukraine as the U.S., under the Trump administration, races to make a peace deal with Moscow. When U.S. and Russian officials met in Riyadh on Feb. 18 for preliminary talks on ending the war, EU officials feared Europe was being shut out of the peace process altogether. U.S. President Donald Trump has said he wants Europe to play a greater role in supporting Ukraine&apos;s financial and defense needs, but his administration has sent mixed signals as to whether Europeans are welcome in the negotiations process. Since the outbreak of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Finland has provided Ukraine with 2.5 billion euros ($2.6 billion) in defense aid. On Feb. 24, the day marking the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Nordic countries Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, announced additional aid funding for Ukraine &#x2014; with Finland providing 4.5 million euros ($4.7 million) through the Partnership Fund for a Resilient Ukraine (PFRU) for 2025-2027 to support Ukraine&apos;s resilience and stability.	https://kyivindependent.com/finland-to-provide-ukraine-with-691-in-military-equipment/	2025-02-26T20:12:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1250760048.jpg
Bulgarian court orders recount of parliamentary election results amid voting discrepancies	Bulgaria&#x2019;s Constitutional Court ordered a full recount of the country&apos;s October 2024 parliamentary election results on Feb. 26 following an audit that discovered various voting discrepancies. The court-issued recount puts at risk a slim six-seat majority for former Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, the current leader of the coalition government. Multiple parties contested the results of the vote at the local level after they were revealed, citing irregularities. Following a court-ordered audit, voting discrepancies were found in nearly half of the sampled polling stations. Following the recount, adjustments to the total seat counts in Bulgaria&apos;s parliament may be made, the court said, potentially impacting the fragile government coalition. The announcement of the recount comes amid a unstable last few years in the EU country, with a total of seven elections being held since 2021 &#x2014; none of which have been able to produce a stable government. Borissov, current head of the conservative-populist Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) party, resigned from his post in 2021 amid corruption allegations. The recount in the Balkan country comes alongside news on Feb. 26 that Calin Georgescu, presidential candidate and right-wing populist in neighboring Romania, was charged by prosecutors for alleged crimes related to the country&apos;s recent elections. Georgescu, a pro-Russian candidate, emerged as the frontrunner in Romania&apos;s presidential race in the first-round vote on Nov. 24. Romania&apos;s Constitutional Court annulled those results after reviewing evidence of &quot;organized manipulation from abroad.&quot; Bulgaria has provided Ukraine with a variety of aid since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, but the matter has been contentious due to significant pro-Russian sentiment in the country and opposition from President Rumen Radev.	https://kyivindependent.com/bulgarian-court-orders-recount-of-parliamentary-election-results-amid-voting-discrepancies/	2025-02-26T19:07:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2123616394.jpg
US declines to sign WTO statement condemning Russian aggression	The United States abstained from signing a statement by members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) condemning Russian aggression on Feb. 26, breaking from its Western allies. A total of 45 members, including Ukraine, agreed to the WTO statement. &quot;The decision not to co-sponsor was made in keeping with our position in the United Nations Security Council and U.N. General Assembly earlier this week&quot;, a U.S. official told Reuters after the decision. The statement, proposed during Ukraine&#x2019;s Trade Policy Review, emphasized members&apos; concerns surrounding the &quot;consequences of (the war&apos;s) destruction for Ukraine and for global trade,&quot; while explicitly naming Russia as the aggressor. The move aligns with recent U.S. efforts to soften language on Russia in international statements. The WTO agreement comes just days after the U.S. voted against a resolution at the UN General Assembly on Feb. 24 condemning Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, with 93 countries voting in favor and 18 against. The UN resolution, drafted by Kyiv and supported by all EU states except Hungary, reaffirmed Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity. It explicitly named Russia as the aggressor. On the same day, the General Assembly passed a separate U.S. resolution marking the third anniversary of the invasion. That resolution also received 93 votes in favor but avoided directly calling Russia the aggressor. Ukraine abstained from voting on the U.S. version. The shift in U.S. language extends across international institutions. The Financial Times reported that the U.S. opposed referring to Russia as the aggressor in a G7 statement commemorating the invasion&apos;s anniversary. U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia while adopting increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Kyiv. He recently called President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and falsely claimed Ukraine started the war &#x2014; before later conceding that &quot;Russia attacked, but they shouldn&#x2019;t have let him attack.&quot; Despite the developing rift, Kyiv and Washington agreed to a mineral deal agreement, with Zelensky likely headed to Washington for a signing ceremony on Feb. 28.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-declines-wto-statement-condemning-russian-aggression/	2025-02-26T17:58:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2170630663.jpg
Far-right Romanian presidential candidate detained, charged in election probe	Romanian presidential candidate and right-wing populist Calin Georgescu was detained by police on Feb. 26 and charged by prosecutors for alleged crimes related to the country&apos;s recent elections. Georgescu, a pro-Russian candidate who has referred to Ukraine as a &quot;fictional state,&quot; emerged as the frontrunner in Romania&apos;s presidential race in the first-round vote on Nov. 24. Romania&apos;s Constitutional Court annulled those results after reviewing evidence of &quot;organized manipulation from abroad.&quot; The Romanian Prosecutor General&apos;s office has now charged Georgescu with &quot;incitement to actions against the constitutional order&quot; and other crimes in a six-count indictment. Georgescu was allegedly on his way to newly register his candidacy on Feb. 26 when he was detained and called in for questioning at the Prosecutor General&apos;s office, his communications team claimed in a Facebook post. The post included video footage of police stopping Georgescu and serving him documents from state prosecutors. Romanian authorities on Dec. 4 declassified evidence of what they described as a &quot;highly organized&quot; social media campaign backed by a &quot;state actor&quot; to boost Georgescu, a fringe ultranationalist who has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin. A relative unknown, Georgescu won 23% of the votes in the first round, defeating pro-EU reformist Elena Lasconi, who took 19%. The Romanian foreign intelligence agency (SIE) reported that &quot;aggressive Russian hybrid attacks, including cyberattacks, information leaks, and sabotage&quot; contributed to Georgescu&apos;s unexpected victory. The subsequent court decision to annul the Nov. 24 election result triggered criticism from U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who claimed the ruling was the result of &quot;flimsy suspicions ... and enormous pressure&quot; during his speech at the Munich Security Conference. Billionaire Elon Musk, another key ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, responded to news of Georgescu&apos;s arrest with a post on X, the social media platform he owns. &quot;This is messed up,&quot; he wrote. Bloomberg reported on Feb. 18 that the Trump administration has pressured the Romanian government to allow Georgescu&apos;s candidacy to proceed, despite evidence of Russian interference. Georgescu has said that if elected president, he would ban Ukrainian grain exports through Romania and halt further military aid to Ukraine. A new first round of presidential elections in Romania is scheduled for May 4. The current indictment could interfere with Georgescu&apos;s ability to run a second time.	https://kyivindependent.com/far-right-romanian-presidential-candidate-detained-charged-in-election-probe/	2025-02-26T16:50:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2202150445.jpg
Romania approves shooting down drones that violate its airspace	The Romanian parliament passed a law on Feb. 26 that allows the country to shoot down drones that violate its airspace. The move comes after multiple incidents in which Russian drones crashed onto Romanian territory during attacks against neighboring Ukraine. &quot;Unmanned aircraft illegally crossing the Romanian state border and flying in national airspace without authorization may be destroyed, neutralized, or taken control of,&quot; the law says. Following its approval in parliament, the law will now advance to the desk of interim Romanian President Ilie Bolojan, who assumed the duties of the head of state after former President Klaus Iohannis announced his resignation on Feb. 10. &quot;We are strengthening Romania&apos;s defense!&quot; Interim Senate Chair Abrudean Mircea said in a Facebook post announcing the new law. Last month, Romania&apos;s Defense Ministry confirmed that it had found Russian drone fragments in two communities near the Romania-Ukraine border. The drone wreckage was found after Russia launched an overnight aerial attack against Ukraine. It was not the first time that wreckage of Russian drones has been found in Romania, a NATO member state. Romania&apos;s military has scrambled F-16 fighter jets to protect the country&apos;s airspace amid Russian attacks against Ukrainian port infrastructure on the Danube River. In response to Russia&apos;s escalating attacks, Romania&apos;s Defense Ministry in October 2024 published a draft law allowing Romania to shoot down aircraft illegally violating its airspace.	https://kyivindependent.com/romania-approves-shooting-down-drones-that-violate-airspace/	2025-02-26T15:28:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183433232.jpg
Ukraine not on agenda in next US-Russia talks, State Department says	U.S. and Russian officials will not discuss Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine during their meeting in Istanbul on Feb. 27, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said in an email to Reuters. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov announced on Feb. 26 that Washington and Moscow would hold a second round of talks in Turkey, just over a week after delegates from the two countries met in Saudi Arabia for their first direct talks since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The meeting will not include discussions on Ukraine, a State Department spokesperson told Reuters. &quot;To be clear, there are no political or security issues on the agenda. Ukraine is not &#x202F;on the agenda,&quot; the spokesperson said via email. Lavrov said the meeting would focus on the reopening of embassies and diplomatic missions, one of three main objectives named at the conclusion of the Saudi Arabia talks. President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Kyiv will not accept any decisions about Ukraine&apos;s future that arise from negotiations that exclude Ukraine. No Ukrainians were invited to participate in the U.S.-Russia talks in Riyadh. As American officials prepare to meet with a Russian delegation for the second time this month, U.S. President Donald Trump has claimed that a ceasefire deal between Kyiv and Moscow is imminent. Trump said on Feb. 24 &#x2014; the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion &#x2014;&#xA0;that the war could be over &quot;within weeks.&quot; Ahead of official peace negotiations, he has already said that Ukraine &quot;can forget about&quot; joining NATO and that he is interested in signing a deal with Russia on rare earth minerals. The drastic shift in U.S. foreign policy toward Russia has alarmed Ukrainian and European leaders. Zelensky is set to meet with Trump on Feb. 28 to sign a critical minerals agreement and press the U.S. to provide Ukraine with security guarantees. creating a high-level team to facilitate Ukraine peace talks, and exploring ways to strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-not-on-agenda-in-next-us-russia-talks-state-department-says/	2025-02-26T14:04:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193483462.jpg
Zelensky confirms upcoming meeting with Trump	President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 28 to finalize a critical minerals deal between Ukraine and the United States, the president confirmed in his evening address on Feb. 26. Previously, Trump announced that Zelensky would sign the deal at the White House on Feb. 28. &quot;Our teams are working with America, we are preparing for talks this Friday,&quot; Zelensky said in a video posted to his official Telegram channel. &quot;An agreement with America. ... I will meet with President Trump. It is important for me and all of us in the world that America&apos;s assistance is not stopped.&quot; Following a series of intensive negotiations, Washington and Kyiv agreed on a deal to establish a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the &quot;future monetization&quot; of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. Ukraine&apos;s Cabinet of Ministers approved the decision to sign the mineral resources agreement on Feb. 26, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said. The agreement does not lay out any concrete security guarantees in exchange for U.S. access to Ukraine&apos;s mineral resource revenues. Zelensky told reporters that although specific measures are not included in the current agreement, guarantees will be discussed in future negotiations. &quot;Guarantees of peace and security are the key to ensuring that Russia no longer destroys the lives of other nations,&quot; he said in his Feb. 26 address. Zelensky initially rejected a proposed U.S. minerals agreement because it lacked security guarantees for Ukraine, something Kyiv has said is essential to any deal. Zelensky&apos;s rejection triggered backlash from the Trump administration, which put increasing pressure on Ukraine to sign the deal even as it made overtures toward Moscow. The White House has characterized the agreement as a way for the U.S. to &quot;recoup&quot; the financial aid it has directed to Kyiv since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Trump said on Feb. 25 that the deal offers Ukraine &quot;military equipment and the right to fight on.&quot; In his remarks on Feb. 26, Zelensky said the agreement is a sign of U.S. support. &quot;It is important for me and all of us in the world that America&apos;s assistance is not stopped,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-confirms-upcoming-meeting-with-trump/	2025-02-26T12:53:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161013738.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Trump says he will meet Zelensky on Feb. 28 in Washington to sign agreement on minerals	Key developments on Feb. 26: U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will visit Washington on Feb. 28 to sign a minerals agreement between the two countries. &quot;It&apos;s now confirmed, and we&apos;re going to be signing an agreement which will be a very big agreement,&quot; Trump said on Feb. 26 during a White House cabinet meeting. Following weeks of tense negotiations, Washington and Kyiv agreed on a deal to establish a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the &quot;future monetization&quot; of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. It excludes revenue streams already flowing into Ukraine&apos;s budget, meaning it will not impact Naftogaz and Ukrnafta, the country&apos;s largest oil and gas producers. The final version drops earlier U.S. demands for a $500 billion claim over Ukraine&apos;s resources, which had been a major sticking point. Ukraine&apos;s Cabinet of Ministers approved the decision to sign the mineral resources agreement on Feb. 26, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said. Security guarantees, a key issue for Kyiv, are not explicitly included in the agreement but will be discussed in future negotiations, Zelensky told journalists on Feb. 26. Zelensky also said he plans to use the meeting with Trump to ask about continued U.S. support, Washington&apos;s direct talks with Moscow, and the prospect of a broader strategy to end the war. &quot;I have already emphasized that it is unacceptable for us if decisions about us are made without us,&quot; he said. The U.S. and Russia held their first direct negotiations in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, marking the first such meeting since Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion began. A second round is set for Feb. 27, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov saying discussions will include the reopening of embassies. Trump, who has repeatedly said he wants to broker a deal to end the war, suggested a ceasefire agreement was within reach. &quot;Most importantly, by far, we&apos;re going to make a deal with Russia and Ukraine to stop killing people,&quot; he said on Feb. 26. Zelensky noted he hopes to get more answers from the meeting about what to expect from the United States in the near future and &quot;what joint plan we can prepare to end this war.&quot; The meeting comes as Trump&apos;s outreach to Moscow fuels concerns in Kyiv and among European allies. He has also escalated rhetoric against Zelensky, calling him a &quot;dictator without elections,&quot; echoing Russian propaganda narratives. His remarks ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia launched its full-scale invasion. Security guarantees Kyiv is seeking are not specified in a mineral deal agreement with Washington, but will be discussed in future rounds of negotiations with the U.S. and other allies, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Feb. 26. The deal, finalized on Feb. 25, follows weeks of negotiations that strained relations between Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump. Washington initially proposed three versions, with Kyiv rejecting the first two over the absence of security guarantees. The latest version of the agreement, which was obtained by the Kyiv Independent, aims to create a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the &quot;future monetization&quot; of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. While it does not contain concrete security guarantees, the agreement states that the U.S. government &quot;supports Ukraine&apos;s efforts to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace.&quot; &quot;I asked for an understanding that all this is part of the future security guarantees of Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said of the deal, adding that he wanted &quot;at least a sentence about security guarantees for Ukraine to appear in the &#xA0;agreement &#x2014; and it did appear.&quot; Trump also on Feb. 26 said that Europe, rather than the U.S., would be mainly responsible for providing security guarantees to Ukraine. &quot;I&apos;m not going to make security guarantees beyond very much &#x2014; we&apos;re going to have Europe do that because we&apos;re talking about Europe is their next door neighbor,&quot; he said during a cabinet meeting at the White House. Trump added that the U.S. would ensure &quot;everything goes well&quot; and, as anticipated, would collaborate with Ukraine on rare earth minerals. &quot;We very much need rare earth &#x2014; they have great rare earth,&quot; he said. It&apos;s unclear whether Trump&apos;s reference to Ukraine&apos;s &quot;rare earth&quot; was meant to indicate the country&apos;s critical minerals or other resources, as Ukraine possesses only small deposits of rare earths. Earlier versions of the deal reportedly included a controversial clause requiring Ukraine to repay U.S. aid at a two-to-one ratio, meaning for every dollar received, Kyiv would have to return two. &quot;From what I was told, the &apos;two-to-one&apos; provision is not there, and thank God,&quot; Zelensky told reporters at the meeting. The president also emphasized that Ukraine would not assume debt under the agreement. &quot;Despite what is being said in the media, the agreement does not include any $500 billion debt, $350 billion, or $100 billion. Because that would be unfair to us,&quot; he said. The latest draft of the agreement drops earlier U.S. demands for a $500 billion claim over Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, which had been a major sticking point. This agreement will be followed by a more detailed Fund Agreement, which will define the terms of the Reconstruction Investment Fund, jointly managed by Ukraine and the U.S. The Fund Agreement will require ratification by Ukraine&apos;s parliament. U.S. and Russian officials will meet for a second round of Ukraine peace talks on Feb. 27 to discuss the reopening of embassies, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said. &quot;Such a meeting will take place tomorrow in Istanbul. I think that its results will show how quickly and effectively we can move forward,&quot; he said in comments reported by Russian state media. Lavrov also said that Russia will not allow the deployment of European peacekeepers in Ukraine. The first round of talks on Feb. 18 in Saudi Arabia marked the first direct negotiations between the U.S. and Russia since Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion began, with Russia&apos;s delegation, led by Lavrov, sitting down with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials. Ukraine was not invited to participate. Following the initial meeting, Rubio outlined three main objectives both sides had agreed to pursue. These include restoring embassy staff in Washington and Moscow, creating a high-level team to facilitate Ukraine peace talks, and exploring ways to strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries. Elsewhere, an agreement between Kyiv and Washington regarding Ukraine&apos;s critical minerals and natural resources will grant Ukraine &quot;military equipment and the right to fight on,&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 25. Speaking to reporters from the Oval Office of the White House, Trump said that the agreement gave Ukraine billions of dollars in aid and &quot;lots of equipment.&quot; Trump denied having spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding U.S. access to critical minerals in Russian-occupied Ukrainian lands. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 26 that Ukraine will not be allowed to join NATO as part of a future peace agreement with Russia and ruled out lifting sanctions on Moscow before a deal is reached. &quot;You can forget about (NATO membership). That&apos;s probably the reason the whole thing started,&quot; Trump said during a White House cabinet meeting when asked what concessions Ukraine should make in a settlement. Trump has repeatedly blamed President Joe Biden for provoking Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion by supporting Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations. Russian propaganda often cites Ukraine&apos;s potential alliance membership as a justification for the war. Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022. While the alliance declared in 2024 that Ukraine&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; no formal invitation has been extended. President Volodymyr Zelensky has called NATO membership the &quot;cheapest&quot; possible security guarantee for Ukraine. Asked whether sanctions relief for Russia would be part of peace negotiations, Trump said, &quot;No. I want to see if we make a deal (to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine) first.&quot; Washington has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion, targeting banks, energy exports, and dual-use goods. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio previously indicated that sanctions relief could be part of negotiations but insisted the U.S. would maintain restrictions at least until an agreement is reached. Trump&apos;s comments come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky prepares to visit Washington on Feb. 28 to sign a minerals agreement with the U.S. Ukrainian drones successfully struck the Tuapse oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai region overnight on Feb. 26, a source in Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;According to intelligence sources, the attack on the facility resulted in at least 40 explosions and a fire, damaging oil refining equipment,&quot; the source said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Earlier on Feb. 26, Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry said 128 Ukrainian drones had been downed over the country, 83 of them in Krasnodar Krai. It did not report any damage or casualties but unverified videos posted to social media showed explosions in the area, including at a nearby seaport. Last night, a large-scale drone attack targeted Russia&#x2019;s Krasnodar Krai as part of an effort to enforce peace. Key sites, including the commercial port in Tuapse and various facilities in the city, were struck. Russia&#x2019;s Ministry of Defense claimed to have intercepted 128 drones&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/8Fh20JC6uy The HUR source said the refinery and port &quot;plays an important role in ensuring the military logistics of the occupying Russian army.&quot; &quot;The oil terminal in Tuapse is one of the largest in the Russian Federation, and the Tuapse port is one of the key Russian cargo ports on the Black Sea,&quot; they added. Rosneft&apos;s Tuapse refinery has been repeatedly targeted by Ukrainian strikes over the past year. Following an earlier strike, the facility underwent an emergency shutdown in May. Ukraine has escalated attacks against Russia&apos;s oil industry, successfully reducing the processing capacities of multiple facilities. Ukrainian troops have regained control of the village of Kotlyne, near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, the 25th Separate Airborne Brigade reported on Feb. 26. The village of Kotlyne is located some 10 kilometers (6 miles) west of Pokrovsk. Kotlyne and Pokrovsk are connected by the T0406 highway, which also leads to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. &quot;Paratroopers of the 25th Separate Airborne Brigade of the Airborne Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces cleared the village of Kotlyne near Pokrovsk during the assault and recovery operations,&quot; the statement read. The estimated Russian advance at Kotlyne, Donetsk Oblast, as of Feb. 26, 2025, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)If Russian troops occupied the settlement, they would have been able to access the Pokrovsk-Dnipro highway, the military said. The embattled city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast is among the most hotly contested areas of the front. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi previously claimed that 7,000 Russian soldiers were killed near Pokrovsk in January alone. The Ukrainian military, which has published daily estimates of Russian losses since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, has reported that 870,700 personnel have been killed or wounded since the start of the all-out war. According to a report from the monitoring group DeepState in late January, Russian forces have been concentrating nearly half of their attacks in the Pokrovsk direction.

Ukraine hits key Russian military sites in Crimea, Krasnodar Krai, General Staff says	Ukraine targeted key Russian military and industrial sites in occupied Crimea and Krasnodar Krai, striking the Saky and Kacha military airfields and the Tuapse oil refinery, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 26. The operation, conducted by Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces and military intelligence agency (HUR) in coordination with other units, aimed to degrade Russia&apos;s air operations and logistical capabilities. Saky and Kacha airfields, located in occupied Crimea, are used by Russia to control airspace over the Black Sea and to launch strikes on Ukrainian territory. The Tuapse oil refinery, with an annual processing capacity of 12 million tons, is significant in supplying fuel to the Russian military. At least 40 explosions were reported near the refinery, with claims of damage to infrastructure, according to the General Staff. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its air forces shot down 128 Ukrainian drones overnight on Feb. 26. It reported downing 83 drones over Krasnodar Krai, 30 over occupied Crimea, and several others over the Azov and Black Seas, as well as in Bryansk and Kursk oblasts. &quot;Strikes on military and strategic facilities involved in the Russian armed aggression against Ukraine will continue,&quot; the General Staff said. Kyiv has intensified strikes on Russian fossil fuel infrastructure, aiming to disrupt revenue sources funding Moscow&apos;s war effort. Ukraine regularly conducts deep strikes on military and industrial targets in Russia, predominantly using domestically developed drones.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hits-key-russian-military-sites-in-crimea-krasnodar-krai-general-staff-claims/	2025-02-26T12:09:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2187953056.jpg

Zelensky officially dismisses Joint Forces Commander Andrii Hnatov, now serving in General Staff	President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 26 officially dismissed Brigadier General Andrii Hnatov as commander of the Joint Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, after appointing him deputy chief of the General Staff in January. Hnatov has held the position since June 26, 2024, replacing Yurii Sodol. In late January, Zelensky announced that Hnatov would be sent to the General Staff to serve as a deputy chief, saying, &quot;his task is a new level of training of operational headquarters and a higher quality of interaction between the headquarters and the front.&quot; &quot;We discussed these and some other changes with Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrsky,&quot; add that &quot;tasks have been set at all levels,&quot; the president said at the time. While holding the position of Joint Forces commander, Hnatov also served as the commander of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group. When announcing Hnatov would be moved to the General Staff in January, Zelensky appointed Major General Mykhailo Drapatyi, commander of Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces, to lead the Khortytsia operational-strategic group. Hnatov previously served as the deputy commander of the Southern Operational Command.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-dismisses-joint-forces-commander-hnatov/	2025-02-26T11:56:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/453631283_902313778591342_3007613341411061451_n.jpg
5 killed, 11 injured in Russian airstrike on Kostiantynivka in Donetsk Oblast	Russian airstrikes on Kostiantynivka in Donetsk Oblast killed at least five civilians and injured 11 others on Feb. 26, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. According to Ukraine&apos;s National Police, a 47-year-old woman and four men &#x2014; aged 56, 57, and 75, with one more yet to be identified &#x2014; were killed. The injured include five women and six men, ranging from 33 to 83 years old. Filashkin said Russian forces dropped three guided bombs on the city and its outskirts. The attack damaged or destroyed at least 52 civilian sites, including more than 20 residential buildings. Kostiantynivka, located about 10 kilometers (6 miles) southwest of the front-line city of Chasiv Yar, had a prewar population of around 67,000. Russian forces have regularly targeted settlements in Donetsk Oblast with artillery and airstrikes, often resulting in civilian casualties.	https://kyivindependent.com/5-killed-11-injured-in-russian-attack-on-kostiantynivka/	2025-02-26T10:44:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-26_16-53-10.jpg

No security guarantees in US minerals deal, to be discussed later, Zelensky says	Security guarantees Kyiv is seeking are not specified in a mineral deal agreement with Washington, but will be discussed in future rounds of negotiations with the U.S. and other allies, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Feb. 26. The deal, finalized on Feb. 25, follows weeks of negotiations that strained relations between Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump. Washington initially proposed three versions, with Kyiv rejecting the first two over the absence of security guarantees. The latest version of the agreement, which was obtained by the Kyiv Independent, aims to create a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the &quot;future monetization&quot; of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. While it does not contain concrete security guarantees, the agreement states that the U.S. government &quot;supports Ukraine&apos;s efforts to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace.&quot; &quot;I asked for an understanding that all this is part of the future security guarantees of Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said of the deal, adding that he wanted &quot;at least a sentence about security guarantees for Ukraine to appear in the &#xA0;agreement &#x2014; and it did appear.&quot; Trump also on Feb. 26 said that Europe, rather than the U.S., would be mainly responsible for providing security guarantees to Ukraine. &quot;I&apos;m not going to make security guarantees beyond very much &#x2014; we&apos;re going to have Europe do that because we&apos;re talking about Europe is their next door neighbor,&quot; he said during a cabinet meeting at the White House. Trump added that the U.S. would ensure &quot;everything goes well&quot; and, as anticipated, would collaborate with Ukraine on rare earth minerals. &quot;We very much need rare earth &#x2014; they have great rare earth,&quot; he said. It&apos;s unclear whether Trump&apos;s reference to Ukraine&apos;s &quot;rare earth&quot; was meant to indicate the country&apos;s critical minerals or other resources, as Ukraine possesses only small deposits of rare earths. Earlier versions of the deal reportedly included a controversial clause requiring Ukraine to repay U.S. aid at a two-to-one ratio, meaning for every dollar received, Kyiv would have to return two. &quot;From what I was told, the &apos;two-to-one&apos; provision is not there, and thank God,&quot; Zelensky told reporters at the meeting. The president also emphasized that Ukraine would not assume debt under the agreement. &quot;Despite what is being said in the media, the agreement does not include any $500 billion debt, $350 billion, or $100 billion. Because that would be unfair to us,&quot; he said. The latest draft of the agreement drops earlier U.S. demands for a $500 billion claim over Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, which had been a major sticking point. This agreement will be followed by a more detailed Fund Agreement, which will define the terms of the Reconstruction Investment Fund, jointly managed by Ukraine and the U.S. The Fund Agreement will require ratification by Ukraine&apos;s parliament. U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed that Zelensky will arrive in Washington on Feb. 28 to sign the mineral agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-us-minerals-deal-references-security-guarantees-without-specifics-zelensky-says/	2025-02-26T10:03:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161013738.jpg
Trump says he will meet Zelensky on Feb. 28 in Washington to sign agreement on minerals	U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will visit Washington on Feb. 28 to sign a minerals agreement between the two countries. &quot;It&apos;s now confirmed, and we&apos;re going to be signing an agreement which will be a very big agreement,&quot; Trump said on Feb. 26 during a White House cabinet meeting. Following weeks of tense negotiations, Washington and Kyiv agreed on a deal to establish a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the &quot;future monetization&quot; of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. It excludes revenue streams already flowing into Ukraine&apos;s budget, meaning it will not impact Naftogaz and Ukrnafta, the country&apos;s largest oil and gas producers. The final version drops earlier U.S. demands for a $500 billion claim over Ukraine&apos;s resources, which had been a major sticking point. Security guarantees, a key issue for Kyiv, are not explicitly included in the agreement but will be discussed in future negotiations, Zelensky told journalists on Feb. 26. Zelensky also said he plans to use the meeting with Trump to ask about continued U.S. support, Washington&apos;s direct talks with Moscow, and the prospect of a broader strategy to end the war. &quot;I have already emphasized that it is unacceptable for us if decisions about us are made without us,&quot; he said. The U.S. and Russia held their first direct negotiations in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, marking the first such meeting since Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion began. A second round is set for Feb. 27, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov saying discussions will include the reopening of embassies. Trump, who has repeatedly said he wants to broker a deal to end the war, suggested a ceasefire agreement was within reach. &quot;Most importantly, by far, we&apos;re going to make a deal with Russia and Ukraine to stop killing people,&quot; he said on Feb. 26. Zelensky noted he hopes to get more answers from the meeting about what to expect from the United States in the near future and &quot;what joint plan we can prepare to end this war.&quot; The meeting comes as Trump&apos;s outreach to Moscow fuels concerns in Kyiv and among European allies. He has also escalated rhetoric against Zelensky, calling him a &quot;dictator without elections,&quot; echoing Russian propaganda narratives. His remarks ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia launched its full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-says-to-meet-zelensky-on-feb-28-to-make-a-deal-on-minerals/	2025-02-26T09:55:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197144376--1-.jpg
Ukrainian director of commercials Vitalii Kokoshko killed in Russia's war	Vitalii Kokoshko, a Ukrainian director of commercials and veteran of the Ukrainian advertising industry, was killed in Russia&apos;s war, his daughter Olha Kokoshko wrote on Facebook on Feb. 25. Kokoshko joined the Ukrainian Armed Forces at the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. He served in the 72nd Mechanized Brigade, which defended Kyiv during the first days of the all-out war and then relocated to Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. &quot;My dad was a man of great heart and soul, so our hearts and souls are so deeply affected by his loss. Thank you for your support,&quot; his daughter wrote. The soldier&apos;s daughter added that he was killed in his brigade&apos;s unit, without specifying any other details. Kokoshko was 58 years old. As a director and producer, Kokoshko has made over 400 commercials. In 1998, he founded the Kinograf advertising agency. He received 43 Effie Ukraine awards and over 350 awards from creative advertising festivals, including Cannes Lions, Epica, Eurobest, and Golden Drum.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-commercials-director-vitalii-kokoshko-killed-in-russias-war/	2025-02-26T07:11:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/414007590_1661525397708968_7413840240881385105_n.jpg
Ukraine's DTEK plans LNG import deal by April, Bloomberg reports	Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy company, DTEK, is in talks with several sellers for a two-year liquefied natural gas (LNG) import contract into the country, CEO Maxim Timchenko said in an interview at IE Week in London, Bloomberg reports. &#xA0; The company expects to finalize and announce the deal within the next two months, with most potential partners based in the U.S. DTEK is also exploring longer-term agreements of 10 to 20 years with suppliers, including those from the Middle East. Timchenko declined to disclose specific suppliers, as negotiations are still in the early stages. &quot;We want to build a medium-term and long-term business,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;We want to see Ukraine be an offtaker with gas storage facilities.&quot; In June 2024, DTEK signed the first major deal with U.S. Venture Global to supply LNG to Ukraine for two years. It was the first time ever Ukraine has never purchased U.S. LNG directly. According to the agreement, Ukraine and other Eastern European countries would receive gas from Venture Global&apos;s Plaquemines plant located on the Gulf Coast in Louisiana. DTEK successfully imported Ukraine&apos;s first US LNG shipment through a Greek terminal in December, utilizing gas swaps to transfer it into the European system since Ukraine lacks its own import facility, Bloomberg wrote. The energy company plans to maintain monthly LNG imports and is exploring additional European terminals in Poland, Lithuania, Croatia, and Germany for future deliveries.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-dtek-plans-lng-import-deal-by-april-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-26T05:36:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201456171.jpg
Ukraine's agriculture industry has lost $80 billion due to Russian invasion, minister says	Ukraine&apos;s agricultural sector has suffered around $80 billion in losses due to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Agriculture Minister Vitalii Koval said on Feb. 25 during a World Bank report presentation. This figure includes not only direct damage but also indirect damage caused by disrupted logistics, increased fertilizer and fuel costs, expenses for land reclamation and demining, and occupied territories, the minister added. &quot;I&apos;m convinced that the restoration of the agricultural sector must begin today,&quot; Koval said. &quot;A key priority is helping farmers in front-line territories.&quot; The agricultural sector plays a vital role in Ukraine&apos;s economy, comprising approximately 20% of the country&apos;s GDP, Koval said earlier. After Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion broke out in 2022, Ukraine&apos;s previously dominant share of non-agricultural exports declined significantly. According to a study by the German-Ukrainian Agricultural Policy Dialogue project, after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion began, Ukraine&#x2019;s non-agricultural exports have declined significantly, while agricultural food exports have remained relatively stable, providing vital support to the Ukrainian economy. Koval previously said that farmers, together with agro-processors, produce about 60% of export revenues, playing a key role in the Ukrainian economy amid the full-scale war. Throughout the full-scale war, Moscow has attempted to obstruct Ukraine&apos;s agricultural exports by blockading the Black Sea and trying to replace Ukrainian products in global markets with its own, including grain looted from occupied territories. Despite these challenges, Ukraine reopened a maritime trade corridor in 2023, enabling the revival of its agricultural exports. In 2024, Ukraine&apos;s agricultural exports reached $24.5 billion, approaching pre-war levels and achieving the second-highest record after 2021&apos;s $27.7 billion. Last year, agricultural exports accounted for 59% of the country&apos;s total exports.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-agriculture-industry-lost-80-billion-due-to-russian-invasion-official-says/	2025-02-26T05:33:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1242310109.jpeg
Exclusive: The full text of the US-Ukraine mineral deal	The Kyiv Independent has obtained from a source in the Ukrainian government the full text of the mineral deal agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine and is publishing the text in full. Kyiv and Washington agreed on a deal on Feb. 25. The negotiations around the deal have fueled tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the past week. Zelensky will likely head to Washington for a signing ceremony in the coming weeks, according to reports. The signing could come as early as Feb. 28, a senior Ukrainian official reportedly told AFP. This first document will be followed by a Fund Agreement, which will further define the terms of the Reconstruction Investment Fund, created by the U.S. and Ukraine. That document will require ratification by Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament. The full text is as follows: BILATERAL AGREEMENT ESTABLISHING TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR A RECONSTRUCTION INVESTMENT FUND WHEREAS the United States of America has provided significant financial and material support to Ukraine since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022; WHEREAS the American people desire to invest alongside Ukraine in a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine; WHEREAS the United States of America and Ukraine desire a lasting peace in Ukraine and a durable partnership between their two peoples and governments; WHEREAS the United States of America and Ukraine recognize the contribution that Ukraine has made to strengthening international peace and security by voluntarily abandoning the world&apos;s third largest arsenal of nuclear weapons; WHEREAS the United States of America and Ukraine wish to ensure that those States and other persons that have acted adversely to Ukraine in the conflict do not benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine following a lasting peace; NOW, THEREFORE, the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Ukraine (each, a &#x201C;Participant&#x201D;) hereby enter into this Bilateral Agreement Establishing Terms and Conditions for a Reconstruction Investment Fund to deepen the partnership between the United States of America and Ukraine, as set forth herein. 1.

Joint ownership will take into consideration the actual contributions of the Participants as defined in Sections 3 and 4. The Fund will be jointly managed by representatives of the Government of Ukraine and the Government of the United States of America. More detailed terms pertaining to the Fund&#x2019;s governance and operation will be set forth in a subsequent agreement (the Fund Agreement) to be negotiated promptly after the conclusion of this Bilateral Agreement.

The Fund will collect and reinvest revenues contributed to the Fund, minus expenses incurred by the Fund, and will earn income from the future monetization of all relevant Ukrainian Government-owned natural resource assets (whether owned directly or indirectly by the Ukrainian Government), as defined in Section 3 3. The Government of Ukraine will contribute to the Fund 50 percent of all revenues earned from the future monetization of all relevant Ukrainian Government-owned natural resource assets (whether owned directly or indirectly by the Ukrainian Government), defined as deposits of minerals, hydrocarbons, oil, natural gas, and other extractable materials, and other infrastructure relevant to natural resource assets (such as liquified natural gas terminals and port infrastructure) as agreed by both Participants, as may be further described in the Fund Agreement.

Timeline, scope and sustainability of contributions will be further defined in the Fund Agreement. The Fund, in its sole discretion, may credit or return to the Government of Ukraine actual expenses incurred by the newly developed projects from which the Fund receives revenues. Contributions made to the Fund will be reinvested at least annually in Ukraine to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine, to be further defined in the Fund Agreement. The Fund Agreement will also provide for future distributions. 4. Subject to applicable United States law, the Government of the United States of America will maintain a long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine. Further contributions may be comprised of funds, financial instruments, and other tangible and intangible assets critical for the reconstruction of Ukraine. 5. The Fund&apos;s investment process will be designed so as to invest in projects in Ukraine and attract investments to increase the development, processing and monetization of all public and private Ukrainian assets including, but not limited to, deposits of minerals, hydrocarbons, oil, natural gas, and other extractable materials, infrastructure, ports, and state-owned enterprises as may be further described in the Fund Agreement. The Government of the United States of America and the Government of Ukraine intend that the investment process will lead to opportunities for distribution of additional funds and greater reinvestment, to ensure the sufficient supply of capital for the reconstruction of Ukraine as set out in the Fund Agreement. The Participants reserve the right to take such action as necessary to protect and maximize the value of their economic interests in the Fund. 6. The Fund Agreement will include appropriate representations and warranties, including those necessary to ensure that any obligations the Government of Ukraine may have to third parties, or such obligations that it may undertake in the future, do not sell, convey, transfer pledge, or otherwise encumber the Government of Ukraine&#x2019;s contributions to the Fund or the assets from which such contributions are derived, or the Fund&#x2019;s disposition of funds. In drafting the Fund Agreement, the Participants will strive to avoid conflicts with Ukraine&#x2019;s obligations under its accession to the European Union or its obligations under arrangements with international financial institutions and other official creditors. 7. The Fund Agreement will provide, inter alia, an acknowledgment that both the Fund Agreement and the activities provided for therein are commercial in nature. The Fund agreement shall be ratified by the Parliament of Ukraine according to the Law of Ukraine &#xAB;On International Treaties of Ukraine&#xBB;. 8. The Fund Agreement will pay particular attention to the control mechanisms that make it impossible to weaken, violate or circumvent sanctions and other restrictive measures. 9. The text of the Fund Agreement will be developed without delay by working groups chaired by authorized representatives of the Government of Ukraine and the Government of the United States of America. Contact persons responsible for preparing the Fund Agreement on the basis of this Bilateral Agreement are: from the Government of the United States of America: the Department of the Treasury; from the Government of Ukraine: Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Economy. 10. This Bilateral Agreement and the Fund Agreement will constitute integral elements of the architecture of bilateral and multilateral agreements, as well as concrete steps to establish lasting peace, and to strengthen economic security resilience and reflect the objectives set forth in the preamble to this Bilateral Agreement. The Government of the United States of America supports Ukraine&#x2019;s efforts to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace. Participants will seek to identify any necessary steps to protect mutual investments, as defined in the Fund Agreement. 11. This Bilateral Agreement is binding &#xA0;and will be implemented by each Participant according to its domestic procedures.

More than 40 explosions' — HUR confirms Ukrainian drone strike on Russia's Tuapse oil refinery	Ukrainian drones successfully struck the Tuapse oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai region overnight on Feb. 26, a source in Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;According to intelligence sources, the attack on the facility resulted in at least 40 explosions and a fire, damaging oil refining equipment,&quot; the source said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Earlier on Feb. 26, Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry said 128 Ukrainian drones had been downed over the country, 83 of them in Krasnodar Krai. It did not report any damage or casualties but unverified videos posted to social media showed explosions in the area, including at a nearby seaport. Last night, a large-scale drone attack targeted Russia&#x2019;s Krasnodar Krai as part of an effort to enforce peace. Key sites, including the commercial port in Tuapse and various facilities in the city, were struck. Russia&#x2019;s Ministry of Defense claimed to have intercepted 128 drones&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/8Fh20JC6uy The HUR source said the refinery and port &quot;plays an important role in ensuring the military logistics of the occupying Russian army.&quot; &quot;The oil terminal in Tuapse is one of the largest in the Russian Federation, and the Tuapse port is one of the key Russian cargo ports on the Black Sea,&quot; they added. Rosneft&apos;s Tuapse refinery has been repeatedly targeted by Ukrainian strikes over the past year. Following an earlier strike, the facility underwent an emergency shutdown in May. Ukraine has escalated attacks against Russia&apos;s oil industry, successfully reducing the processing capacities of multiple facilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/more-than-40-explosions-hur-confirms-ukrainian-drone-strike-on-russias-tuapse-oil-refinery/	2025-02-26T04:39:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-26-at-14_29_27-1.png
Ukrainian forces liberate Kotlyne village near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast	Ukrainian troops have regained control of the village of Kotlyne, near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, the 25th Separate Airborne Brigade reported on Feb. 26. The village of Kotlyne is located some 10 kilometers (6 miles) west of Pokrovsk. Kotlyne and Pokrovsk are connected by the T 0406 highway, which also leads to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. &quot;Paratroopers of the 25th Separate Airborne Brigade of the Airborne Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces cleared the village of Kotlyne near Pokrovsk during the assault and recovery operations,&quot; the statement read. The estimated Russian advance at Kotlyne, Donetsk Oblast, as of Feb. 26, 2025, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)If Russian troops occupied the settlement, they would have been able to access the Pokrovsk-Dnipro highway, the military said. The embattled city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast is among the most hotly contested areas of the front. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi previously claimed that 7,000 Russian soldiers were killed near Pokrovsk in January alone. The Ukrainian military, which has published daily estimates of Russian losses since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, has reported that 870,700 personnel have been killed or wounded since the start of the all-out war. According to a report from the monitoring group DeepState in late January, Russian forces have been concentrating nearly half of their attacks in the Pokrovsk direction.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-forces-liberate-kotlyne-village-near-pokrovsk-in-donetsk-oblast/	2025-02-26T03:58:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2191667263.jpg

Trump says sanctions against Russia to be lifted 'at some point'	Sanctions against Russia will be lifted &quot;at some point,&quot; President Donald Trump said on Feb. 25 during a press briefing at the White House. Trump&apos;s comments come as the U.S. and Russia renew contact between officials, including face-to-face discussions on ending the war in Ukraine, reopening embassies in Washington and Moscow, and resuming economic cooperation. &quot;No, we haven&apos;t lifted any sanctions on anybody&#x2026; I guess it will be at some point, but right now, we haven&apos;t agreed to lift sanctions on anybody,&quot; Trump said. Russia has been extensively targeted by Western sanctions since the launch of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Biden administration and the U.K. imposed in January their most extensive sanctions yet on Russia&apos;s oil sector, targeting nearly 200 vessels in the &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; key oil companies, and related entities. These measures, announced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on Jan. 10, have already impacted the global oil market, pushing Brent crude prices up by nearly $5 per barrel. Trump previously said that he would likely impose additional sanctions against Russia if Russian President Vladimir Putin fails to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine. The Trump team is reportedly weighing two primary approaches, according to Bloomberg. The first set of policy recommendations suggests that, if a resolution to the war appears possible, the administration should focus on good-faith measures to benefit sanctioned Russian oil producers that could help seal a peace deal. The second option would involve expanding sanctions to exert maximum pressure, increasing leverage over Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-admits-sanctions-against-russia-to-be-lifted-at-some-point/	2025-02-26T02:37:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194989577.jpg
Hitler wanted to kill me because I'm Jewish. Putin wants to kill me because I'm Ukrainian	Editor&#x2019;s Note: The following is a translated transcript of the address delivered by Roman Shvartsman, the chairman of the Odesa Association of Jews and a Holocaust survivor, at the Yalta European Strategy (YES) Special Gathering hosted by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 24, 2025, marking the third anniversary of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &#x201C;Ladies and gentlemen, A month ago, the German Bundestag commemorated the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. I had the opportunity to speak there as someone who lived through oppression, brutal violence, and endless suffering during World War II. I told them: (Adolf) Hitler wanted to kill me because I am Jewish. (Russian President Vladimir) Putin wants to kill me because I am Ukrainian. You swore: &#x2018;Never again.&#x2019; This &#x2018;never again&#x2019; has arrived. If you are serious, you must support Ukraine differently than you have before. Even if you have already done a lot, we now need action. I don&#x2019;t need to tell you about the suffering of Jews and Ukrainians under German occupation. Babyn Yar is widely known today as a symbol of this abuse, but there were around 2,000 such sites in Ukraine. People in the West know little about this. These were ordinary people carrying out shootings, beatings, burnings, and mass killings. And those who survived the war often returned to their civilian lives, undisturbed. Germany now does a lot to remember. &#x2018;Never again&#x2019; accompanies every memorial service, but this &#x2018;never again&#x2019; is missing a second part. After the unprecedented murders, after humanity stared into the abyss of National Socialism, simply saying &#x2018;never again&#x2019; is not enough. &#x2018;Never again&#x2019; needs a second part: &#x2018;Never again&#x2019; defenseless victims. &#x2018;Never again&#x2019; crimes against humanity. This is a lesson the world must learn from the horrors of the 20th century. The UN Charter enshrines this commitment, yet human rights are trampled every day, borders are forcibly redrawn, and entire nations are threatened. We (Ukraine) are a country under attack from our large neighbor for 11 years. The war has not lasted three years, but 11. Russia wants to conquer and destroy us as an independent state. We are bombed day and night, our energy system is destroyed, and our culture is under attack. There is real terror and the killing of civilians in Russian-occupied territories. And why? Because we want our freedom. Because we want to be part of a free Europe, not a Russian colony. Many countries have pledged their support. At the United Nations, 141 countries condemned the Russian invasion and called for the withdrawal of Putin&apos;s forces. We were hardly ready for war, but the war continued, and people kept dying. We were told that time had not run out. But what was that time when we hardly received any weapons? The time after the first Russian invasion was not used. Where was the military support from Germany, which emphasizes &#x2018;never again?&#x2019; When Putin gathered his troops around us, when he said we were &#x2018;Little Russia,&#x2019; when he announced he wanted to divide the world into zones of influence again, most countries refused to believe it. They were comfortable in their prosperous societies, enjoying cheap Russian gas, and denying that it could ever be their turn. While defense spending in Europe was cut, the American people were paying for Europe&#x2019;s security. We shouldn&#x2019;t be surprised when the man who won the election told Americans: &#x2018;We will not do it anymore. Europeans have to defend themselves.&#x2019; I think we must care for the democratic world together &#x2014; Ukraine, the European Union, and the United States. But now the oldest and most powerful democracy in the world has elected a leader who is turning everything upside down. Victims are being labeled as criminals.

(Les Kasyanov/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)We, Ukrainians, were shocked to see (U.S. President Donald) Trump negotiating with Putin as if nothing had happened. And we, the occupied, are told we should never have started this war. We cannot understand what the American president says and writes. But Europe, with its 450 million citizens and powerful economic space, must finally realize that the era of comfort and prosperity is over. Freedom is not free. Perhaps now we have Munich in 1938, the Hitler-Stalin Pact, and Yalta. If we allow this to happen, the war will not end with Putin conquering Ukraine. If Russia is not stopped in Ukraine, the threat of war for all of Europe will grow. That is why I tell my European friends: the war will come to you. Just as the calculations didn&#x2019;t work in Munich, they won&#x2019;t work this time if you abandon Ukraine. You are poorly armed. You cannot defend yourselves without Ukraine. That is why I tell you: Ukrainians are protecting you every day, year after year, for years. This is also your front, which Putin has opened in Eastern Europe. Finally, realize this. Have the courage now, or your free societies will also perish. Dear guests, I am an old man. I was in the ghetto. I looked the devil in the eye. I tell the democratic world: don&#x2019;t be afraid of him. You give too much power to evil. If you stand together and overcome your fear, you can defeat the devil. Thank you for listening.&#x201D; Editor&#x2019;s Note: The opinions expressed in the op-ed section are those of the authors and do not purport to reflect the views of the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/hitler-wanted-to-kill-me-because-im-jewish-putin-wants-to-kill-me-because-im-ukrainian/	2025-02-26T02:32:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/YES_3Years_time_to_WIN_0809.JPG
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 5, injure 36 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed five civilians and injured 36 others over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 26. Russian forces launched 177 drones from the Russian cities of Orel, Bryansk, Kursk, Shatalovo, Millerovo, and Primosk-Akhtarsk at Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 110 drones over Kharkiv, Sumy, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kirovohrad, Kherson, Mykolaiv, and Kyiv oblasts, the Air Force said. Another 67 drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are often decoys which Russia sends alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian forces killed one civilian and injured 16 others in the Krasnotorka village in the Kramatorsk community. One person was also killed in the village of Yampil, while another was injured in the town of Kostiantynivka, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 36 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, over the past day. As a result of the attacks, one person was killed, and eight other people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. On Feb. 26 morning, Russian forces also struck the village of Zelenivka with artillery, injuring a 72-year-old woman. She was hospitalized in a moderately severe condition. In Kharkiv Oblast, a man was killed, and another was injured in a Russian attack with multiple rocket launchers against the villages of Bilyi Kolodiaz and Karaiichne. Russia also targeted the village of Kutkivka with an FPV (first-person-view) drone, injuring a 55-year-old man. In the village of Zolochiv, two women suffered injuries as a result of glide bombs attacks, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. In Kyiv Oblast, Russia carried out several strikes with drones, causing a fire in the Bucha district. Rescuers found a body while extinguishing the fire, the local military administration reported. A woman and a man also suffered injuries in other settlements in Kyiv Oblast. In Chernihiv Oblast, one person was injured in an attack against the village of Halahanivka, and another suffered injuries in an FPV strike on the village of Manukhivka, Operational Command &quot;North&quot; reported. In Sumy Oblast, one civilian was injured in an FPV strike on the Bilopillia community, the local military administration reported. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, a 57-year-old man suffered injuries in an attack on the village of Stepnohirsk. Russian troops launched a total of 499 strikes on 12 settlements in Zaporizhzhia Oblast over the past day, according to the local military administration. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian forces hit a facility owned by DTEK, Ukraine&apos;s largest private energy company. The company did not specify which facility was affected. Power engineers are currently working on restoring its operation.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-5-injure-36-over-past-day/	2025-02-26T01:54:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-26-09_40_58.jpeg
128 Ukrainian drones attack Russia overnight, Krasnodar Krai port targeted	Russian forces downed 128 drones overnight on Feb. 26 over several Russian regions and Russian-occupied Crimea, the country&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed. The Russian air forces shot down 83 drones over Krasnodar Krai and destroyed another 30 drones over Russian-occupied Crimea. Eight drones were downed over the Azov, while another five over the Black Sea. Russia also reportedly shot down one drone in Bryansk and another in Kursk oblasts. Residents reported explosions in the cities of Tuapse and Anapa in Krasnodar Krai, while the airport in Sochi was closed due to a drone attack, the independent Telegram channel Astra reported. The Tuapse sea trade port was also reportedly targeted, according to Astra. The governor of Krasnodar Krai, Veniamin Kondratyev, said there were no casualties in the region, but several houses were damaged. Ukraine routinely launches deep strikes against military and industrial facilities in Russia, primarily relying on domestically developed drones. Kyiv has particularly taken aim at Russia&apos;s fossil fuel infrastructure as part of its strategy to undermine funding for the Kremlin&apos;s war chest.	https://kyivindependent.com/almost-130-drones-attack-russia-targeting-port-in-krasnodar-krai/	2025-02-25T23:13:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-26-08_49_50.jpeg
Poland to adapt all civilian airports for dual-military use	All civilian airports in Poland must be modernized and adapted for potential use by the country&apos;s military, Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said on Feb. 25. In comments reported by Polish Radio, Kosiniak-Kamysz said such adaptations would allow them to be used as transport hubs, evacuation points, cargo hubs, or aid points in the event of an emergency. &quot;Every airport must be adapted and in some way adapted to the possibility of cooperating and working with the military,&quot; he said. Kosiniak-Kamysz said work was already underway at some major Polish airports &#x2014; a &quot;cargo hub, together with a railway siding, with fuel supplies&quot; are being built at both Katowice and Wroclaw, and &quot;preparatory processes&quot; are underway at Krakow. Situated on NATO&apos;s eastern flank, Poland has taken several steps to boost its military since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk advocated for increased defense spending across NATO on Jan. 15, arguing that if all European members matched Poland&#x2019;s spending, NATO&#x2019;s defense budget would be ten times that of Russia&#x2019;s. &quot;Other countries should not pay 1.5 percent of their GDP for defense &#x2014; this is not enough,&quot; he said, emphasizing that robust European defense contributions could help maintain friendly U.S.-European relations. On Jan. 7, Trump called for NATO&#x2019;s spending target to rise to 5% of GDP, significantly higher than the current 2% goal. &quot;If all European countries start taking their obligations in NATO seriously, I am sure America will be happy to cooperate with us,&quot; Tusk added. While the 5% suggestion has faced resistance, some NATO members are reportedly open to a more modest increase, potentially to 3% of GDP, Reuters reported on Jan. 10.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-to-adapt-all-civilian-airports-for-dual-military-use/	2025-02-25T23:08:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2076698613.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 870,700 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 870,700 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 26. This number includes 1,170 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,201 tanks, 21,183 armored fighting vehicles, 38,702 vehicles and fuel tanks, 23,686 artillery systems, 1,299 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,085 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 26,961 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-870-700-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-02-25T22:24:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/DSCF7839.jpg
Media: Slovak National Party calls on Fico to apologize after Slovakia backs UN resolution condemning Russian aggression	The Slovak National Party has demanded that Prime Minister Robert Fico immediately apologize for supporting a UN resolution condemning Russia&#x2019;s aggression against Ukraine, Czech news outlet Denik N reported on Feb. 25. The UN General Assembly approved a Ukrainian resolution on Feb. 24 condemning Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, with 93 countries voting in favor and 18 against. The resolution, drafted by Kyiv and supported by all EU states except Hungary, reaffirms Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity. It explicitly names Russia as the aggressor. The Slovak National Party stated that an investigation should determine who authorized the Slovak representative at the UN to vote in this manner. The party also emphasized that Slovakia must uphold a consistent stance, and insisted that its representatives in international institutions should not vote against the policies set by Fico&#x2019;s government and backed by the Slovak National Party. &quot;It is important that the Slovak Republic maintains its position and a clear stance, as Hungary, led by Viktor Orban, does,&#x201D; the statement said. &#x201C;If the government declares something, it is unthinkable that our representatives in international institutions would vote contrary to the policy advocated by the government led by Robert Fico with the support of the Slovak National Party.&#x201D; Fico won Slovakia&apos;s parliamentary elections in September 2023. It is his fourth time at the helm of the Slovak government. Before Fico&apos;s return to power, Slovakia had been a staunch supporter of Ukraine. It was the first country to send Kyiv fighter jets after the full-scale invasion and a reliable supplier of military aid. Fico&apos;s government initiated a stark policy reversal, halting weapons deliveries to Ukraine and adopting rhetoric blaming the West for Russia&apos;s war.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-slovak-national-party-calls-on-fico-to-apologize-after-slovakia-backs-un-resolution-condemning-russian-aggression/	2025-02-25T21:47:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188638934.jpg
Poland to transfer 5,000 more Starlink terminals to Ukraine	Polish Deputy Prime Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski confirmed on Feb. 25 that Poland has ordered 5,000 Starlink terminals for Ukraine. He commented on the importance of Ukrainians having access to Starlink, especially after the start of the war. &#x201C;Starlink provides internet and security in both civilian and military spheres. Thanks to this, the front holds,&#x201D; he said. Gawkowski also noted that Poland helps to fund and maintain Starlink access in Ukraine, providing half of all terminals in Ukraine. &quot;Poland is maintaining it, Poland purchased Starlink and transferred it to Ukraine. Poland ensures security by paying the subscription fees. I cannot imagine any American corporation violating such agreements.&quot; More than 20,000 Starlink terminals have been lent to Ukraine by Warsaw since 2022. Tensions have been growing in recent months between Ukraine and Starlink&#x2019;s owner, billionaire Elon Musk, over his ties to Russia and comments about Ukraine. Starlink internet terminals have played a crucial role in securing communications in the war in Ukraine, with most battlefield positions equipped with their own terminal. Last year, Ukraine said that approximately 42,000 terminals were in operation across the military, hospitals, businesses, and aid organizations.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-to-transfer-5-000-more-starlink-terminals-to-ukraine/	2025-02-25T20:26:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1813800965.jpeg
Russian film critic who previously criticized authorities detained in Moscow	The Russian Investigative Committee detained film critic Ekaterina Barabash in Moscow, her son Yuri Barabash reported on Facebook on Feb. 25. The reasons for her detention remain unclear, but it is presumed to be linked to her professional activities, including her work for Republic, a Russian publication that was added to the foreign agent media register and banned in March 2022. Republic Editor-in-Chief Dmitry Kolezev, who recently left Russia, confirmed this on his Telegram channel. Russian state-owned outlet RIA Novosti also confirmed her detention. Barabash&#x2019;s legal status and the nature of the case remain unspecified. Both of her parents were born in Ukraine, and Barabash had publicly supported the country on her social media, most recently on Feb. 23. Her son, Yuri, has been living and working in Ukraine for many years. Previously, Barabash was fired from Interfax in 2016 for criticizing Russian authorities. Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s crackdown on dissent since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine has seen thousands of his citizens arrested and many jailed.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-film-critic-who-previously-criticized-authorities-detained-in-moscow/	2025-02-25T18:31:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/barabash.jpg
Trump says Russian oligarchs could be eligible for $5 million US 'gold card'	Russian oligarchs could be eligible to apply for the &quot;gold card,&quot; a $5 million path to U.S. residency and citizenship that U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Feb. 25. Trump unveiled his &quot;gold card,&quot; a scheme to attract &quot;people of wealth&quot; to the U.S. while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Feb. 25. &quot;We&apos;re going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million and that&apos;s going to give you green card privileges, plus it&apos;s going to be a route to citizenship,&quot; he said. Trump said individuals who apply for the card would be heavily vetted, but did not name any countries that would be restricted from the program. When asked if Russian oligarchs would be eligible for the gold card, Trump said they could likely apply. &quot;Yeah, possibly. Hey, I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people,&quot; he said. Trump said Russian oligarchs are &quot;not quite as wealthy as they used to be,&quot; an apparent reference to Western sanctions, but did not object to the idea of such individuals applying for the gold card. &quot;I think they can afford $5 million,&quot; he said. &#xA0; The Trump administration had previously taken measures to soften Washington&apos;s stance against Russian elites, shutting down a government task force that sanctioned Kremlin-linked oligarchs. The White House has meanwhile cracked down on immigration, suspending multiple programs allowing migrants to enter the country, including an initiative for Ukrainians established by former U.S. President Joe Biden. &#xA0; Trump has made increasingly friendly overtures to Moscow in recent days, including speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin and arranging direct talks between U.S. and Russian officials without Ukraine&apos;s participation. Trump also said he&apos;s open to striking a deal with Russia regarding rare earth deposits.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-says-russian-oligarchs-could-be-eligible-for-5-million-us-gold-card/	2025-02-25T16:06:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201360456.jpg
Military equipment and the right to fight on' — Trump on what US minerals deal gives Ukraine	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. An agreement between Kyiv and Washington regarding Ukraine&apos;s critical minerals and natural resources will grant Ukraine &quot;military equipment and the right to fight on,&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 25. President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s office confirmed on Feb. 25 that the U.S. and Ukraine had reached an agreement regarding Ukraine&apos;s critical minerals after an intense period of negotiations. Speaking to reporters from the Oval Office of the White House, Trump said that the agreement gave Ukraine billions of dollars in aid and &quot;lots of equipment.&quot; It was unclear if he was referring to future or past military aid packages from the U.S. The deal gives Ukraine &quot;military equipment and the right to fight on, and originally, the right to fight,&quot; Trump said. Trump also said that Zelensky would visit the White House on Feb. 28 to sign the deal. The finalized agreement, dated Feb. 24, reportedly offers Kyiv no security guarantees in exchange for 50% of revenues from the &quot;future monetization&quot; of Ukraine&apos;s state-owned mineral resources. The White House has said that the agreement is necessary in order for the U.S. to &quot;recoup&quot; the funds it has granted to Ukraine in aid packages over the past three years of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. &quot;Ukraine, I will say they&apos;re very brave, and they&apos;re good soldiers, but without the United States and its money and its military equipment, this war would have been over in a very short time,&quot; Trump said. Trump also said he was open to striking a deal on critical minerals with Russia. &quot;I&apos;d like to buy minerals on Russian land too if we can,&quot; he said. &quot;The rare earth, they have very good rare earth ... It&apos;s great for Russia too, because we could do deals there. They have very valuable land that isn&apos;t utilized, so something like that could take place.&quot; Trump denied having spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding U.S. access to critical minerals in Russian-occupied Ukrainian lands. Putin on Feb. 24 &#x2014;&#xA0;the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine &#x2014;&#xA0;said that Moscow was open to working with foreign partners on developing rare earth metal deposits, including in occupied regions of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/military-equipment-and-the-right-to-fight-on-trump-on-what-minerals-deal-gives-ukraine/	2025-02-25T14:52:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197654088.jpg
State Department officials want to unfreeze US aid to Ukraine, Politico reports	Officials at the U.S. State Department are requesting exemptions to Washington&apos;s freeze on foreign aid that would free up funds for Ukraine, Politico reported on Feb. 25. The U.S. imposed a 90-day freeze on nearly all foreign aid projects when President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20. The funding freeze affected critical humanitarian aid and reconstruction programs in Ukraine. Senior State Department officials are putting together a list of exemptions for Ukraine, Politico reported, citing an official, two other sources with knowledge of the matter, and a document obtained by the outlet. These exemptions would extend beyond the U.S. waiver for &quot;life-saving&quot; programs and would allow Ukraine to receive funding for demining, narcotics control, and civil society projects. Plans for the additional Ukraine exemptions have been in the works since late January, Politico reported. Internal conversations regarding the matter took place as recently as last week. According to a document seen by Politico, waivers cannot be granted for any initiatives supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). It remains uncertain whether the exemptions will be granted. In response to a question on new waivers for Ukraine, the State Department issued a statement saying that &quot;programs that serve our nation&apos;s interests will continue. However, programs that aren&apos;t aligned with our national interest will not.&quot; U.S. policy towards Ukraine has shifted dramatically in recent weeks, with American officials holding direct talks with Russian delegates, the U.S. siding with Russia on a U.N. resolution about the war, and Trump attacking President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s legitimacy in public comments. The U.S. has also said it wants to &quot;recoup&quot; the aid money it has granted to Kyiv over the course of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. The two countries reportedly reached an agreement on Feb. 25 that would give the U.S. access to Ukraine&apos;s natural resource revenues &#x2014;&#xA0;without offering Kyiv any security guarantees.	https://kyivindependent.com/state-department-officials-want-to-unfreeze-us-aid-to-ukraine-politico-reports/	2025-02-25T14:13:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193483462.jpg
Macron wins no security guarantees from Trump on peacekeepers plan, FT reports	French President Emmanuel Macron did not receive any specific security guarantees from the United States regarding a plan to deploy European peacekeepers to monitor a future ceasefire in Ukraine, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Feb. 25. Macron visited U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Feb. 24 to discuss Ukraine&apos;s postwar security options in the event of a peace deal with Russia. Trump claimed that such a deal could come &quot;within weeks.&quot; While Macron spoke optimistically about his meeting with Trump, calling it &quot;a turning point&quot; in U.S. support for European peacekeeping efforts, officials told the FT that Washington offered no specific guarantees. There is &quot;no definitive agreement&quot; as to how the U.S. will provide security assurances for peacekeeping forces in Ukraine, a French official said. Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who will meet with Trump later this week, are coordinating on a proposal for Ukraine&apos;s postwar security that involves a European peacekeeping force that would rely heavily on air power and be backed by the U.S. The plan would reportedly include a small land force of 30,000 European troops. &#xA0; Starmer has said that this plan requires a U.S. &quot;backstop&quot; to deter future Russian aggression. Following their meeting on Feb. 24, both Macron and Trump signaled openness to U.S. support for the European peacekeeping proposal.&quot;There are Europeans that are ready to engage to provide for these security guarantees,&quot; Macron said. &quot;Now there&apos;s a clear American message that the U.S. as an ally is ready to provide that solidarity for that approach.&quot; When asked if the U.S. would support European troops, Trump said that it would, without getting into details. &#xA0; &quot;We will have a backing of some kind. Obviously European countries are going to be involved,&quot; he said. Trump then said that Europe would not likely &quot;need much backing&quot; because he did not expect Russia to violate a ceasefire agreement. Trump also said that Russian President Vladimir Putin would accept the presence of European troops in Ukraine, a term the Kremlin has repeatedly opposed. The French official who spoke to the FT said that despite the lack of concrete security guarantees on the table at this stage, Trump appeared open to the idea of a U.S. backstop. &quot;There is no objection from President Trump to the Americans giving security guarantees,&quot; the official said.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-wins-no-security-guarantees-from-trump-on-peacekeepers-plan-ft-reports/	2025-02-25T13:08:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201784068.jpg
Taurus missiles, stronger Europe — what can Ukraine hope for after German elections	The victory of the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) led by Friedrich Merz was met with relief in Ukraine. The conservative leader has long criticized the supposedly cautious Ukraine strategy of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose government collapsed last November, triggering the snap vote. Merz&apos;s likely coalition with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) is sure to maintain Berlin&apos;s pro-Kyiv trajectory. And with Scholz leading the SPD into the election, saying that he would not take part in the next government, the two dominant parties would have the potential to push Europe to do more for Ukraine. Such a push would be crucial at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump seems to be sidestepping Kyiv&apos;s and Europe&apos;s interests to clinch a swift peace deal with Russia. Underscoring this tectonic geopolitical shift, Merz has used his victory speech to call for Europe&apos;s strategic &quot;independence&quot; from the U.S. &#x2014; a tall order amid the continent&apos;s lagging defense industry, rising populism, and unrelenting Russian threat. The CDU/CSU secured first place in the elections with 28.5% of the vote, almost eight percentage points ahead of the runner-up AfD. Scholz&apos;s SPD, in turn, suffered a historic defeat, coming in third with 16.4% &#x2014; its worst result since the 1880s. The SPD&apos;s former coalition partners fared no better, with the Greens dropping to 11.6% and the centrist Free Democratic Party (FDP) getting booted from the Bundestag. The Left party (Die Linke), which has condemned Russian aggression but opposes military aid to Ukraine, made a surprise comeback with 8.8%, while its Russian-leaning, anti-immigration splinter, the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), failed to hit the 5% parliamentary threshold by a razor-thin margin of 0.03%. Sahra Wagenknecht, party leader of the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), pictured at a press conference in the Haus der Bundespressekonferenz.

The conservative leader has already rejected any negotiations with the AfD over its far-right agenda and pro-Moscow stance, aiming instead to hash out a coalition deal with the ostensibly &quot;defeated&quot; SPD by Easter. &quot;The world won&apos;t wait for us, it won&apos;t wait for long, drawn-out coalition negotiations,&quot; Merz said as his party colleagues were celebrating the Sunday victory. The failure of the FDP and the BSW to hit the 5% threshold means a less fractured parliament and allows Merz to seek only a single coalition partner &#x2014; the SPD &#x2014; without entering into more complex three-way talks with the Greens. &quot;A possible triple-coalition would risk a less stable government, and that would, logically, benefit the AfD in the opposition,&quot; said Zuzana Zavadilova, a Germany researcher at the Prague-based Association for International Affairs think tank. Speaking to the Kyiv Independent, the expert said that the decisively pro-Ukraine Greens may play the role of a &quot;constructive opposition,&quot; standing in contrast to the Russian-friendly AfD and Ukraine-skeptic Left. As Scholz has ruled out participating in the CDU/CSU-SPD coalition talks, the question of the next leading figure among the Social Democrats remains. &quot;SPD leader Lars Klingbeil is expected to be elected as the leader of the SPD parliamentary group in the German Bundestag on (Feb. 26). He is already being referred to by many as &apos;the new powerhouse&apos; of the SPD,&quot; said Martin Bialecki, editor-in-chief of the journals Internationale Politik (IP) and Internationale Politik Quarterly (IPQ). &quot;The current defense minister, Boris Pistorius, will also play an important role,&quot; Bialecki predicts, referring to the popular politician under whom Germany stood as Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor. If both Klingbeil and Pistorius &quot;lead the SPD through much-needed reforms while being in government, this could be a net positive for Ukraine as both have been among the most hawkish in support of Kyiv,&quot; Jorn Fleck, senior director with the Europe Center at the Atlantic Council, told the Kyiv Independent. The conservative leader and long-time party rival of ex-Chancellor Angela Merkel has come into the spotlight of Ukraine watchers months before the German elections. Merz has repeatedly lambasted Scholz for his reluctance to provide Ukraine with Taurus missiles, long-range weapons capable of hitting targets 500 kilometers (300 miles) away. However, as Merz&apos;s future chancellorship became evident, the CDU chairman began tempering expectations. According to Fleck, Merz has toned down hawkish stances during his campaign to &quot;avoid alienating eastern German voters.&quot; The politician later clarified that Taurus deliveries must be coordinated with the U.S. and that the step should be taken only after long-range strikes with already provided arms prove insufficient to force Russia to talks. This would imply that the Trump administration&apos;s opposition to strikes inside Russia and its courting of the Kremlin in the name of a quick peace deal might complicate Taurus deliveries. But the events of the past few weeks made Merz, a lifelong Atlanticist, seemingly realize that Europe must forge its own path to ensure security for itself and Ukraine. &quot;My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the U.S.,&quot; Merz laid out his priorities after the elections. &quot;I never thought I would have to say something like this on a television program. But after Donald Trump&apos;s statements last week&#x2026; it is clear that the Americans, at least this part of the Americans, this administration, are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe.&quot; The shock turn came after Trump denounced Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky as a &quot;dictator&quot; and after U.S. Vice President JD Vance delivered a scathing speech against Germany and other European countries during the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15. Amid the uncertainty of the continued U.S. support, &quot;Merz has clearly positioned himself. He does understand that much more is expected of Europe&apos;s largest economy and political power, especially if Washington wavers, or worse,&quot; Fleck said. The chancellor-in-waiting has already launched talks with the SPD on 200 billion euros ($210 billion) in a special defense fund and floated the idea of nuclear sharing with France and the U.K. In light of Trump&apos;s comments, the German politician warned that NATO might not survive in its current form and that Europe should create its own alternative. As Europe is shaping up to be Kyiv&apos;s chief advocate and fears of a possible U.S.-Russia pact grow, Merz has also stressed that Ukraine must be part of any peace talks. But after decades of geopolitical dependence, decoupling from the U.S. is no easy feat. &quot;Even if Europe wants to become &apos;independent&apos; of the U.S., it will take many, many years. Europe has neither the military, nor the economic, nor the technological means to stand on its own two feet,&quot; Bialecki warns. According to Fleck, Merz&apos;s success will depend on three variables: &quot;the economy, his own party&apos;s stance on the debt break, and his junior coalition partner&apos;s disposition.&quot; Yet, not all is sunshine in Berlin. While it was effectively cut off from the government talks, the AfD&apos;s rise in popularity &#x2014; especially in Germany&apos;s east &#x2014; presents a stark warning to Ukraine. Gathering votes on economy and immigration issues, the far-right party has advocated for rapprochement with Russia, criticizing military assistance to Ukraine while calling for the lifting of sanctions and resumption of trade with Moscow. Suspicions that the AfD seeks to strengthen ties with autocracies like Russia and China were only reinforced after several top members came under investigation for collusion with Moscow and Beijing. After Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. election, the AfD gained another ally across the Atlantic. Alice Weidel, co-leader and chancellor candidate of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), speaks to supporters at AfD headquarters after the announcement of initial results in snap federal parliamentary elections on Feb. 23, 2025 in Berlin, Germany. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)The AfD&apos;s cause has been openly promoted by Trump&apos;s top ally, billionaire Elon Musk, who called the far-right party, whose members are suspected of Nazi sympathies, Germany&apos;s &quot;last spark of hope.&quot; And while Trump has congratulated the CDU/CSU on its victory, it was AfD chief Alice Weidel who received Vance in Germany after the U.S. vice president denounced the Munich Security Conference for not inviting Russian-friendly radicals to the event. Merz made clear he sees the AfD-Trump alliance as equally concerning as the far-right party&apos;s sympathies for Russia. &quot;The interventions from Washington were no less dramatic and drastic and ultimately outrageous than the interventions we have seen from Moscow,&quot; he said. Holding one-third of the parliament&apos;s seats, the AfD and the Left can still hamper Merz&apos;s efforts to ramp up defense spending. For example, they could block key funding decisions requiring two-thirds of the Bundestag&apos;s votes unless they are quickly adopted by the current outgoing parliament, Zavadilova notes. &quot;Clearly, the strength of the AfD, the Left, and the BSW should be a concern of all democrats. All three parrot Russian talking points and have at their core anti-American and anti-EU sentiments,&quot; Fleck said. &quot;Here, Merz and the next leadership will finally have to engage the German public in a frank conversation about what is at stake in Ukraine and in Europe.&quot; Hi, this is Martin Fornusek.

Ukraine war latest: Ukraine, US reach agreement on minerals deal	Key developments on Feb. 25: Ukraine has reached an agreement with the U.S. on a minerals deal, Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine&#x2019;s deputy prime minister and justice minister, told the Financial Times on Feb. 25. President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s office confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that an agreement has been reached. The negotiations around the deal have fueled tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and Zelensky in the past week. According to the Financial Times report, Ukraine has secured more favorable terms and framed the deal as a way to strengthen ties with the U.S. Zelensky is expected to head to Washington for a signing ceremony in the coming weeks, according to the Financial Times. The final version of the agreement, dated Feb. 24, establishes a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the &quot;future monetization&quot; of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and related logistics. The fund will invest in projects within Ukraine. The deal excludes resources that already contribute to Ukraine&apos;s state budget, meaning it will not cover operations by Naftogaz and Ukrnafta, the country&apos;s largest oil and gas producers. The agreement does not include security guarantees from the U.S., which Kyiv had initially insisted on. The latest draft of the agreement drops earlier U.S. demands for a $500 billion claim over Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources, which had been a major sticking point, according to the Ukrainian media outlet Economic Pravda, which has seen the agreement. Under the revised terms, the fund will receive 50% of revenues from Ukraine&#x2019;s resource-related infrastructure, including ports. Joint ownership will be determined based on actual financial contributions, and while management will be shared, the U.S. will have decision-making authority under its own laws.The questions of the U.S. stake in the fund and the terms of &#x201C;joint ownership&#x201D; will be addressed in follow-up agreements, according to the Financial Times. Zelensky had previously rejected the U.S. proposal, citing the lack of security guarantees and objecting to the 1:2 repayment structure, which would have required Ukraine to return two dollars for every one received in aid. The Trump administration has increased pressure on Ukraine to finalize the deal in the past weeks, with Trump publicly attacking Zelensky, calling him a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; and urging him to &quot;move fast, or he won&#x2019;t have a country left.&quot; Trump has framed the agreement as a way to strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s economy while ensuring the U.S. &quot;recoups the tens of billions of dollars and military equipment sent to Ukraine.&quot; Russia&apos;s stated goals in its war against Ukraine remain unachieved despite ongoing diplomatic efforts to start peace negotiations, Russian Foreign Ministry&apos;s Ambassador-at-Large Rodion Miroshnik said on Feb. 25, according to the Russian state-owned news agency TASS. &quot;The objectives of the Special Military Operation have not yet been achieved,&quot; Miroshnik said, using the Kremlin&apos;s term for its war against Ukraine. The objectives include Russia&apos;s failure to fully occupy Ukraine&apos;s four regions it has illegally annexed and the need to ensure Kyiv no longer &quot;poses a threat&quot; to Moscow. &quot;The constitutional territories of Russia have not been liberated,&quot; he said. Russia illegally annexed Ukraine&apos;s Crimea in 2014, followed by Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts in 2022. Moscow does not control all of these territories, including the regional capitals of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded Ukraine withdraw from all four oblasts as a condition for negotiations. Miroshnik said that while military objectives remain unachieved, Russia may attempt to achieve them through future negotiations. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Feb. 24 that Moscow would agree to a ceasefire only if negotiations yield a &quot;sustainable result&quot; that &quot;suits&quot; Russia. The U.S. held direct talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, excluding Ukraine from the meeting. The decision sparked criticism in Kyiv and Europe, with leaders concerned about being sidelined in negotiations. Preparations are underway for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin, with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov saying it could happen by the end of February. Trump said on Feb. 24 that Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine could end &quot;within weeks&quot; and claimed Putin would accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a potential deal. The U.K. is reportedly preparing a plan to deploy 30,000 European troops as a post-ceasefire security guarantee. Western intelligence officials have expressed skepticism about Moscow&apos;s willingness to negotiate in good faith. NBC News reported on Feb. 18 that Putin is not serious about a peace deal and is instead using talks to consolidate Russian territorial gains. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 24 that he believes Ukraine might be able to reclaim some of its territories occupied by Russia, but it would be challenging. He stated this in response to journalists during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, which took place at the White House. &quot;You&#x2019;re asking whether or not they (Ukrainians) could take back the land that they lost. And I say that yes, perhaps some of it, yes. But that&#x2019;s not an easy thing to do,&#x201D; Trump said. He also noted that this question is part of the current negotiations that have recently started with Russia. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll see,&#x201D; Trump said. &#x201C;There has been a lot of land that has been taken, so we will have to see how it works out. It&#x2019;s part of the negotiation.&#x201D; The U.S. held the first round of talks directly with Russia on Feb. 18, excluding Ukraine from the meeting. The decision sparked a backlash in Europe and Ukraine, with European leaders worried they were being sidelined by the U.S. Macron has recently rallied European counterparts to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to visit Washington later this week to meet with Trump. The cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine after three years of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion will be $524 billion over the next decade, the U.N. reported on Feb. 25, citing data from Ukraine&apos;s government, the World Bank, the European Commission, and the U.N. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Russia has been attacking Ukrainian cities and villages daily, destroying residential buildings, critical infrastructure, cultural heritage sites, and sports venues, among other facilities. The required reconstruction costs are 2.8 times higher than Ukraine&apos;s nominal GDP for 2024, according to the report. Direct losses in Ukraine reached $176 billion at the end of December 2024 compared to $152 billion in February last year, the Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (RDNA4) by the World Bank estimated. Housing, transportation, energy, trade and industry, and education sectors have suffered the most from Russian attacks, the report read. Some 13% of Ukraine&apos;s total housing stock was damaged or destroyed, affecting over 2.5 million homes. In the energy sector, the number of damaged or destroyed assets, including production, transmission, distribution, and district heating infrastructure, increased by 70%. Donetsk, Kharkiv, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, and Kyiv oblasts sustained nearly 72% of the total damage. Russia&#x2019;s Ryazan oil refinery suspended operations after a Ukrainian drone attack set its main crude distillation unit, CDU-6, on fire, Reuters reported on Feb. 24. The refinery, owned by Russia&apos;s state energy company Rosneft, halted oil processing entirely, multiple industry sources told Reuters. However, it may partially resume operations within days by using CDU-4 and CDU-3 units, while CDU-6 is repaired. The attack caused at least five explosions, with local authorities attributing the fire to falling drone debris. This refinery had only recently resumed activity on Feb. 11 following an 18-day shutdown after a previous attack. This is the third time since the beginning of 2025 that drones have attacked the Ryazan Oil Refinery, according to the independent Telegram channel Astra. The Ryazan Oil Refinery is one of Russia&apos;s five largest oil refining facilities, according to Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation. Its capacity is 17.1 million metric tons of oil per year. Kovalenko added that the fuel produced at the enterprise is used by the Russian army&apos;s strategic long-range aviation, which launches missile strikes against Ukraine.

Russia targets Ukraine’s supply lines in Kursk as both cling to gains ahead of peace talks	Russian forces have ramped up attacks on Ukraine&#x2019;s logistic networks in Kursk Oblast, further hampering the Ukrainian effort to hold on to the Russian territory it controls ahead of potential peace talks, analysts and soldiers on the ground told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;The Russians have been on the offensive in Kursk for several months,&#x201D; said Emil Kastehelmi, a Finnish military analyst from the Black Bird Group open-source intelligence collective. &#x201C;They have made only slow progress in the winter of 2024-25, but they seem to be determined,&#x201D; he added. While Russia has already rejected the possibility of trading its territory for occupied Ukrainian land, pledging to take the land back by military force, Ukraine continues to see its gains in Kursk Oblast as a bargaining chip in future negotiations. Since launching an incursion into the Russian region in early August, Ukraine has lost around two-thirds of the territory it initially captured but continues to control the remainder. Russia&#x2019;s six-month campaign to push Ukrainian soldiers out of Kursk Oblast, involving around 12,000 North Korean soldiers alongside Russian troops, has proved costly for Moscow. But with hampered logistics and in light of Washington&#x2019;s startling alignment with Russia ahead of talks, Ukraine may soon face difficult strategic decisions in the area. Russia&#x2019;s recent attacks in Kursk Oblast are focused on cutting off the only route Ukrainians use for resupply from the adjacent Sumy Oblast in northeastern Ukraine. On the left flank of the Ukraine-controlled salient in Kursk Oblast, Russia launches frequent mechanized assaults that are even more intense than Russian attacks in Pokrovsk, one of the hottest ongoing fights in Ukraine&#x2019;s east, Ruslan Mykula, a military analyst and co-founder of the DeepState OSINT project, said. Mechanized attacks &#x2014; where armored vehicles are used to quickly break through defenses, clearing the way for infantry groups to storm trenches &#x2014; helped Russia capture the village of Sverdlikovo northwest of Ukrainian-controlled Sudzha last week, Mykula told the Kyiv Independent. It brought the Russians &#x201C;uncomfortably close&#x201D; to key Ukrainian logistical routes, Kastehelmi said. &#x201C;There are now less than eight kilometers to the main supply road to Sudzha, which is already in range of Russian drones,&#x201D; he said, adding the complete cut-off of the route is &#x201C;unlikely to happen very quickly.&#x201D; The DeepState monitoring group map shows the Ukrainian gains in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast as of Feb. 25, 2025. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)A Ukrainian artilleryman who has been fighting near Sudzha since August told the Kyiv Independent that the supply situation had deteriorated during the last two weeks. &#x201C;(Logistics) are non-existent,&#x201D; said the soldier going by the callsign &#x201C;Spys.&#x201D; The Kyiv Independent doesn&apos;t use his first and last name for security reasons. &#x201C;The biggest losses of equipment are on the road (between Sumy Oblast and Ukraine&#x2019;s positions in Kursk Oblast),&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;We started rationing (our supplies).&#x201D; Russian forces deployed an elite drone unit that &#x201C;controls the road 24/7 and flies deep into the rear of Ukrainian territory,&#x201D; according to &#x201C;Spys.&#x201D; To be able to use this road, Ukrainian forces have to wait for weather conditions that are unsuitable for drone missions, such as heavy fog or snow. Ukraine has launched several offensive operations in Kursk Oblast after the initial push in August but has only made limited gains. &#x201C;(Russian troops) have a huge advantage in manpower and don&#x2019;t have such problems with logistics, so Ukrainian offensives usually don&#x2019;t end well,&#x201D; Mykula said. However, before Russia captured Sverdlikovo which allowed the ramping up of attacks on Ukraine&#x2019;s logistics, Ukrainian forces managed to fend off Russian attacks on the right flank of the salient and retake their positions after an assault made by North Korean infantry last month, &#x201C;Spys&#x201D; said. &#x201C;(North Koreans were) gaining ground due to the fact that there were so many of them that they simply couldn&#x2019;t (all) be physically killed,&#x201D; Mykula said. Ukrainians still hold the village of Cherkasskaya Konopelka southeast of Sudzha, which they took earlier this month to secure the logistics road on the right flank, despite ongoing Russian assaults. For weeks, &#x201D;Spys&#x201D; says he has not seen North Korean troops in his sector. Of nearly 12,000 North Korean soldiers deployed in Kursk Oblast, 4,000 were killed and wounded, President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on Feb. 14. About two-thirds of the 4,000 were killed, according to Zelensky. Zelensky also claimed that in total, Moscow has lost nearly 20,000 of its soldiers in the battles for Kursk Oblast. Exhausting Russia&#x2019;s &#x201C;human and logistical resources&#x201D; is one of the key Ukrainian objectives in the area, according to Mykula. Bringing some of the fiercest battles to Russian soil also means less destruction for Sumy Oblast villages bordering Russia, and losing ground in Kursk is better for Ukraine than losing its own territories to Russia elsewhere along the front line, experts said. &#x201C;The Kursk operation costs Ukraine a lot, of course, but it costs (Russia) way more,&#x201D; Mykula added.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-targets-ukraines-supply-lines-in-kursk-as-both-cling-to-gains-ahead-of-peace-talks/	2025-02-25T12:07:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168599341.jpg
‘Don’t try to build a whole new drone:’ How one Ukrainian wartime startup got into quantum encryption — and the West	One Ukrainian startup has rebuilt the humble walkie-talkie to weather the waves of modern electronic war with Russia. With thousands of Ukrainian soldiers already using their handheld comms devices, NATO is tuning in. Himera, the walkie-talkie startup in question is about to get a new layer of encryption that founder Misha Rudominsky says will guard their devices against the impending arrival of quantum computing on the battlefield &#x2014; a technological threat that is rattling wartime communications experts worldwide. More immediately, $1.2 million in fundraising, active EU manufacturing, U.S. Air Force testing, and a distribution deal with a Canadian firm are putting Himera on the threshold of selling to NATO and the U.S. Defense Department itself. Himera is one of Ukraine&#x2019;s first startups born in response to Russia&#x2019;s 2022 invasion to get a shot with the broader world&#x2019;s biggest armies. Himera grew out of Rudominsky&#x2019;s earlier project, Promin Aerospace &#x2014; like so many Ukrainian startups, a drone company. It&#x2019;s a market that Rudominsky found saturated, saying, &#x201C;There are a hundred companies in every niche who have tried everything,&#x201D; and advising anyone with startup aspirations not &#x201C;to build a whole new drone.&#x201D; Battlefield communications were, he found, a wide-open area for advancement. Ukrainian soldiers have largely depended on cheap Motorola walkie-talkies never meant to function in battle. By targeting that market, Rudominsky and his team have sold something like 6,000 of their G1 and G1 Pro models to Ukrainian units. They are not feats of physical engineering &#x2014; their components are off-the-shelf products that are easy to find within Ukraine or at other workshops in the European Union. But the software is resilient, Rudominsky says. The hand units link up to mobile phones, allowing encrypted texting and exchange of battlefield planning through apps via radio rather than depending on cell service or Starlink satellites. The complete set-up boasts coveted Ukrainian battlefield testing. The real inventiveness was in going small &#x2014; cheap tactical handhelds that operate on low radio frequencies and tiny electrical charges that slip by Russian sensors and jammers. A new algorithm securing communications between Himera&#x2019;s devices, says Jay Toth, a representative for Canadian encryption startup Quantropi, will also minimize both required computing power and battery consumption. &#x201C;Radio communication, satellite, and video are the three really important data streams on the modern battlefield and we&apos;ve got a pathway to help with the encryption and security on each one,&#x201D; Toth told the Kyiv Independent. A Ukrainian soldier uses a Himera walkie-talkie, a secure communication device designed to withstand modern electronic warfare. (Facebook/Himera)In February, Himera announced a deal with Quantropi to put the Ottawa-based startup&#x2019;s quantum-prepped encryption algorithms into their systems. Like top-secret encryption among the U.S. government and elsewhere worldwide, Himera currently uses Advanced Encryption Standard 256, or AES 256 &#x2014; for decades the gold standard but now under threat from quantum computing. Quantum computing is forcing cryptographers to reconsider how safe their communications are. In August, the U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology released new algorithms that jolted cryptographers with a warning to prepare for &#x201C;quantum computers that would operate in radically different ways from ordinary computers and could break the current encryption that provides security and privacy for just about everything we do online.&#x201D; Toth says Quantropi&#x2019;s default encryption keys are four times the size of AES-256&#x2019;s, but thanks to different math it runs between &#x201C;10&#x2013;14 times faster.&#x201D; The G1 Pros will, however, still have AES-256 as an option so they can link up with non-Himera devices. Specifically, says Rudominsky, this matters as more and more of their radio repeaters &#x2014; larger less mobile units that handle more data &#x2014; head out to market. These bigger terminals are prime targets for the &#x201C;record now, decode later,&#x201D; in which cyber powers are gathering data encrypted with AES-256 assuming that they&#x2019;ll be able to break it in a matter of years. &#x201C;At some point, we&apos;ll have quantum computers,&#x201D; says Rudominsky. &#x201C;Is it going to be in five years, 10, or 15 years? We don&apos;t really know. But what everyone is betting on &#x2014; what the Chinese are betting on, what the Americans are betting on, I don&apos;t know if the Russians are betting on it yet, but if you have enough capacity as a country to record a lot of information, you can break into some database, you might not be able to decode it, but you can at least record the encrypted information.&#x201D; Toth said Himera immediately catches the eye of representatives of upwards of half a dozen NATO militaries he has spoken to. As one of the 17 firms in NATO&#x2019;s DIANA defense tech accelerator, Quantropi is also getting in on a distribution deal to sell the walkie-talkies Himera is building in the EU to NATO countries. And conversely, Himera is helping Quantropi fulfill its pitch to get its technology on the battlefield. &#x201C;What we proposed that got us into the program was using our encryption on these small, resource-constrained devices in the battlefield,&#x201D; Toth explains. &#x201C;It wasn&apos;t any more specific than that when we made the pitch.&#x201D; A Himera walkie-talkie is a secure communication device designed to withstand modern electronic warfare. (Facebook/Himera)Pentagonal motionHimera is consequently coming close to the prized market of the U.S. Defense Department. The U.S. Air Force&#x2019;s Research Lab is currently testing out Himera&#x2019;s radios, says Toth, who estimates that a report on the lab&#x2019;s findings will go out in about a month. &#x201C;We&apos;ve been told anecdotally that everything is going to be very positive,&#x201D; he continued. &#x201C;The price point of a G1Pro is at a minimum five to ten times less expensive than most tactical radios on the market today,&#x201D; says Toth. &#x201C;Every NATO nation I&#x2019;ve talked to, every NATO Defense Ministry I&#x2019;ve talked to did a double-take when I told them what the price point was and said &#x2018;Yes, follow up, I&#x2019;m sending this to my people.&#x2019;&#x201D; Rudominsky similarly foresees a major market among less wealthy militaries in, especially, southeast Asia facing a technologically savvy and increasingly belligerent China. The U.S. Defense Department in contrast pays tens of thousands of dollars for individual military-grade walkie-talkies from brands like L3Harris. Rudominsky notes that the U.S. radio giant formally launched its Falcon IV model six years ago but hasn&#x2019;t released a more compact screen-less version ready for soldiers, despite teasing it. For comparison, he says, &#x201C;In less than three years, we&#x2019;ve already launched and sunset our first product.&#x201D; &#x201C;A lot of those companies are lacking in innovation,&#x201D; says Rudominsky. &#x201C;They used to be the most advanced products &#x2014; 10 years ago, I would say at that point, they probably were at the top of what could be done. But then everyone slowed down.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/dont-try-to-build-a-whole-new-drone-how-one-ukrainian-wartime-start-up-got-into-quantum-encryption-and-the-west/	2025-02-25T11:38:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/476273235_612638458372403_1180523204137655883_n.jpg
Russia's war objectives 'not yet achieved,' Kremlin's ambassador says	Russia&apos;s stated goals in its war against Ukraine remain unachieved despite ongoing diplomatic efforts to start peace negotiations, Russian Foreign Ministry&apos;s Ambassador-at-Large Rodion Miroshnik said on Feb. 25, according to the Russian state-owned news agency TASS. &quot;The objectives of the Special Military Operation have not yet been achieved,&quot; Miroshnik said, using the Kremlin&apos;s term for its war against Ukraine. The objectives include Russia&apos;s failure to fully occupy Ukraine&apos;s four regions it has illegally annexed and the need to ensure Kyiv no longer &quot;poses a threat&quot; to Moscow. &quot;The constitutional territories of Russia have not been liberated,&quot; he said. Russia illegally annexed Ukraine&apos;s Crimea in 2014, followed by Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts in 2022. Moscow does not control all of these territories, including the regional capitals of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded Ukraine withdraw from all four oblasts as a condition for negotiations. Miroshnik said that while military objectives remain unachieved, Russia may attempt to achieve them through future negotiations. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Feb. 24 that Moscow would agree to a ceasefire only if negotiations yield a &quot;sustainable result&quot; that &quot;suits&quot; Russia. The U.S. held direct talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, excluding Ukraine from the meeting. The decision sparked criticism in Kyiv and Europe, with leaders concerned about being sidelined in negotiations. Preparations are underway for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin, with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov saying it could happen by the end of February. Trump said on Feb. 24 that Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine could end &quot;within weeks&quot; and claimed Putin would accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a potential deal. The U.K. is reportedly preparing a plan to deploy 30,000 European troops as a post-ceasefire security guarantee. Western intelligence officials have expressed skepticism about Moscow&apos;s willingness to negotiate in good faith. NBC News reported on Feb. 18 that Putin is not serious about a peace deal and is instead using talks to consolidate Russian territorial gains.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-war-objectives-not-yet-achieved-ambassador-says/	2025-02-25T11:35:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-835906084.jpg
BREAKING: Kyiv, Washington reach agreement on minerals deal	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story. Ukraine has reached an agreement with the U.S. on a minerals deal, Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine&#x2019;s deputy prime minister and justice minister, told the Financial Times on Feb. 25. President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s office confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that an agreement has been reached. The negotiations around the deal have fueled tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and Zelensky in the past week. According to the Financial Times report, Ukraine has secured more favorable terms and framed the deal as a way to strengthen ties with the U.S. Zelensky is expected to head to Washington for a signing ceremony in the coming weeks, according to the Financial Times. The final version of the agreement, dated Feb. 24, establishes a fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of proceeds from the &quot;future monetization&quot; of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and related logistics. The fund will invest in projects within Ukraine. The deal excludes resources that already contribute to Ukraine&apos;s state budget, meaning it will not cover operations by Naftogaz and Ukrnafta, the country&apos;s largest oil and gas producers. The agreement does not include security guarantees from the U.S., which Kyiv had initially insisted on.	https://kyivindependent.com/breaking-kyiv-washington-reach-agreement-on-minerals-deal/	2025-02-25T11:19:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179841418.jpg
Hungary seeks removal of eight names from EU Russia sanctions list, Reuters reports	Hungary is demanding the removal of eight individuals from the EU&apos;s Russia sanctions list and guarantees on Ukraine&apos;s gas transit talks before agreeing to renew restrictions, Reuters reported on Feb. 25, citing sources familiar with the matter. EU sanctions against Russia must be renewed unanimously every six months, and Budapest has repeatedly used the process to negotiate concessions for itself. Hungary has previously secured exemptions for Moscow Patriarch Kirill and domestic use of Russian oil products. Kirill, a close Kremlin ally, has publicly supported Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, yet Budapest has blocked EU efforts to sanction him. The source declined to disclose the names of the individuals Hungary wants removed from the sanctions list. Earlier on Feb. 19, EU ambassadors agreed on a new package of sanctions, targeting Russia&apos;s aluminum trade and the &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of oil tankers. The EU&apos;s sanctions framework consists of economic measures and a list of over 2,400 individuals and entities subject to asset freezes and travel bans. Hungary&apos;s demand to hold gas transit talks with Ukraine is related to Kyiv&apos;s decision to not extend an agreement with Russia, which ensured a gas transit to Europe. As the agreement expired on Jan. 1, Kyiv said it would not finance Russia&apos;s war by allowing the transit going forward. While the EU has reduced reliance on Russian fossil fuels, Hungary and Slovakia remain dependent on Russian gas. Budapest imports around 4.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas annually under a 15-year agreement signed in 2021. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has maintained close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin despite the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, meeting with him and amplifying pro-Russian narratives in Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-seeks-removal-of-eight-names-from-eu-russia-sanctions-list-reuters-reports/	2025-02-25T10:46:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1239783290.jpg
Explainer: Did Trump lie about $350 billion aid to Ukraine, and does Kyiv have to repay it?	U.S. President Donald Trump has claimed that the U.S. spent $350 billion on assistance for Ukraine. He also said he wants it back. Trump has used the sum to pressure Ukraine into signing a deal that would give the U.S. at least a 50% interest in Ukrainian natural resources through a joint investment fund as payback for its support for Kyiv. According to media reports and President Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine would be supposed to gradually contribute $500 billion from its budget revenues from mineral resources to the fund. Ukraine had declined to sign Trump&apos;s version of the deal, with Zelensky saying, &quot;I am not signing something that will be paid by 10 generations of Ukrainians.&quot; The caveat is that both the $350 billion mentioned by Trump as aid provided and the $500 billion demanded in return are not factual and were presented by the White House without explaining where the figures are from. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, the U.S. has provided assistance worth $119.8 billion since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Only around $4 billion has to be repaid, and the repayment deadline is as late as 2065, according to prior agreements. The Kyiv Independent provides a detailed breakdown of the aid provided, how it was measured, and what has happened to it since. The $350 billion aid claim was made by Trump at a news conference on Feb. 19. The statement was immediately contradicted by the Pentagon. The Voice of America reported on Feb. 19, citing the Pentagon and the U.S. government&apos;s Ukraine Oversight interagency group, that the U.S. Congress had appropriated $183 billion for Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. This figure includes $65.9 billion in military aid that has already been sent to Ukraine and an additional $3.9 billion that remains unspent, according to the Pentagon. Zelensky made another claim at a news conference on Feb. 23, saying that the U.S. had allocated just around $100 billion for Ukraine during the full-scale invasion, including $67 billion in military aid and $31.5 billion in financial aid.

(Mustafa Yalcin / Anadolu / Getty Images)What are the facts?Facts confirm that Zelensky&apos;s claim was the closest to the truth. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy&apos;s Ukraine Support Tracker, the U.S. has allocated $119.8 billion for Ukraine during the full-scale war, including $67.1 billion in military aid, $49 billion in financial aid, and $3.6 billion in humanitarian aid. The discrepancy between the Kiel Institute&apos;s figure and the Pentagon&apos;s one is due to the fact that the Pentagon included some Ukraine-related allocations that were not actually sent to Ukraine. Specifically, about $58 billion of the $183 billion in total aid was spent on the U.S. defense industry and did not go to Ukraine. Some of this money was allocated to replace old U.S. weapons given to Kyiv with new U.S.-made weapons. Zelensky said on Feb. 23 that U.S. aid given to Ukraine cannot be counted as debt since it was disbursed in the form of grants. Taras Shchepel, a Ukrainian lawyer who has studied the legal aspects of U.S. aid, and Oleksandr Parashchiy, an analyst at Ukrainian investment bank Concorde Capital, told the Kyiv Independent that the entire military assistance given to Ukraine by the U.S. was in the form of grants and does not have to be repaid. In contrast with military aid, a small share of the financial assistance has been provided in the form of loans. Olena Bilan, chief economist at Ukrainian investment bank Dragon Capital, told the Kyiv Independent that U.S. financial aid to Ukraine includes $32 billion in the form of grants that don&apos;t have to be repaid and loans worth $4 billion. The $4 billion in loans has to be repaid in 2065 but the U.S. president has the authority to write off this debt before Jan. 1, 2026, she said. Additionally, the U.S. has disbursed a $20 billion loan as part of a G7 initiative, according to the Ukraine Oversight Group. However, Ukraine doesn&apos;t have to repay it because this money will be repaid by proceeds from $300 billion in frozen Russian assets. So far, Ukraine has actually received only $1 billion of the $20 billion loan allocated by the U.S., according to Parashchiy and Bilan.	https://kyivindependent.com/explainer-did-trump-lie-about-350-billion-aid-to-ukraine-and-does-kyiv-have-to-repay-it/	2025-02-25T10:42:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/1_GettyImages-2195744586.jpg
Ukraine approves Vidmak drone system to target Russian vehicles	Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry has authorized a new high-speed FPV (first-person view) drone, called Vidmak (Witcher), designed to intercept and destroy Russian vehicles, the ministry announced on Feb. 25. &quot;These high-speed FPV drones are capable of chasing down any wheeled vehicles of the invaders,&quot; the ministry wrote. The Vidmak is manufactured by a Ukrainian enterprise. The compact yet powerful drones can operate day and night, identifying and tracking targets. &quot;The complex was created taking into account the combat experience of our soldiers. Most of the components are domestically produced,&quot; the statement reads. Its high-speed maneuverability allows it to chase down any wheeled Russian vehicle, while its payload is strong enough to destroy armored targets and fortified positions. Kyiv has significantly expanded domestic drone production over the past year, integrating drones into reconnaissance and combat operations. On Feb. 9, the Defense Ministry launched the &quot;Drone Line&quot; initiative to accelerate their deployment on the battlefield. Ukraine has also developed long-range missile-drone hybrids, such as the Palianytsia and Peklo models, featuring turbojet engines as alternatives to cruise missiles. President Volodymyr Zelensky has set a target of producing at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025. The Peklo hybrid drone, described by Zelensky as a &quot;fundamentally new type&quot; of weapon, has a range of 700 kilometers (430 miles) and a top speed of 700 km/h (430 mph).	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-approves-vidmak-drone-system-to-target-russian-vehicles/	2025-02-25T10:16:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-25_14-38-37-2.jpg
What we know about the US, Ukraine minerals deal	The media cycle around a natural resources deal between Washington and Kyiv has been nonstop as the two sides lock horns over an agreement that has escalated from speculative critical minerals to Ukraine&#x2019;s fruitful oil and gas sector.The relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine has been tense since negotiations began at the start of the month. The U.S. has reportedly put forth three proposals, of which the first two have been turned down by the Ukrainian side for not including security agreements, even as Washington ramped up the pressure. As of Feb. 25, the two sides are currently hashing out the final details of the agreement. U.S. President Donald Trump said he will meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky &#x201C;very soon&#x201D; to sign it. But as no details of the agreement have been officially released, the public has had to rely on a whirlwind of leaked information and drafts of the deal to get a sense of what&#x2019;s at stake for Ukraine. Trump first said he wanted to make a deal back on Feb. 3 and a proposal was presented to Zelensky by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Feb. 12. Although the U.S. was keen to get the deal over and done with, Zelensky refused to sign over the lack of security guarantees, leading to an arduous back and forth for the last two weeks. &#xA0;An apparent second proposal dated Feb. 21 that was leaked by Axios correspondent Barak Ravid, set out plans for a U.S.-owned &#x201C;Reconstruction Investment Fund&#x201D; that would require Ukraine to transfer 50% of future profits from its natural resources, including oil and gas, and infrastructure like ports. Around the same time, Ukrainian media outlet New Voice on Feb. 22 reported, citing five sources close to the deal, that the second proposal was &#x201C;much stricter&#x201D; than the first one. In it, Washington would maintain 100% ownership of the fund, while Kyiv would have to contribute $500 billion to the fund as repayment for American aid to Ukraine. Again, no security guarantees were mentioned in the deal. President Volodymyr Zelensky slammed the fund&#x2019;s value, saying U.S. aid had totaled less than $100 billion. He told a conference in Kyiv on Feb. 23 that he wouldn&#x2019;t sign &#x201C;something that will be paid by 10 generations of Ukrainians,&#x201D; particularly without security guarantees. The half-a-trillion-dollar demand is more than twice Ukraine&#x2019;s pre-war GDP. He also took aim at the proposal&#x2019;s stipulation that the Ukrainian government should provide double the money given by the U.S. once the agreement is signed. &#x200B;&#x200B;&#x201C;For every U.S. dollar, Ukraine must return two. In simple terms, this is 100% of the loan,&#x201D; Zelensky said.The proposals so far have ultimately given the White House as much control over Ukraine&#x2019;s main sources of revenue as the Ukrainian government. In addition, the U.S. could earn more than 50% of revenue from assets in the occupied territories if they are liberated, Ukrainian media outlet Ekonomichna Pravda reported on Feb. 22.Since the latest leaked draft, the agreement has changed, with the U.S. dropping the $500 billion request &#x2014; although creating a fund is still on the table, Bloomberg reported citing sources close to the deal. The details will be ironed out after the agreement is signed, according to Bloomberg. Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, backed the latest version, saying that &#x201C;it&#x2019;s better than it was&#x201D; while speaking at the YES conference in Kyiv on Feb. 24.&#x201C;There will not be a penny incurred to that fund unless there is a free sovereign Ukraine. It says the profits will be reinvested at least annually. Ukrainians have negotiated it very, very well,&#x201D; he added. Johnson, a Trump supporter, encouraged Ukraine to sign the deal quickly while acknowledging that &#x201C;it doesn&#x2019;t go far enough on security.&#x201D; Nonetheless, he believes it&#x2019;s still a &#x201C;prospect of progress for Ukraine.&#x201D;Bessent has framed the deal as an economic boost for Ukraine that will incentivize foreign investment. In an op-ed for the Financial Times on Feb. 22, he said the fund would be used for &#xA0;&#x201C;the long-term reconstruction and development of Ukraine where the U.S. will have economic and governance rights in those future investments.&#x201D;During an interview with Fox News Sunday Morning Features on Feb. 23, Bessent said that the first part of the deal is a U.S.-Ukraine partnership for &#x201C;strategic minerals, energy, and state-owned enterprises.&#x201D; He added that Washington is offering an &#x201C;economic security guarantee,&#x201D; rather than meeting Kyiv&#x2019;s demands for a military assurance. The draft dated Feb. 21 stated that the U.S. wants to invest &#x201C;in a free, sovereign, and secure Ukraine&#x201D; and &#x201C;a lasting peace.&#x201D; While it made no mention of military guarantees, it said that the U.S. will work with Ukraine to &#x201C;identify any necessary steps to protect mutual investments.&#x201D; What was once Ukraine&#x2019;s attempt to win over President Trump has descended into a ruthless battle that risks Kyiv giving up its natural resources in return for very little. Kyiv first presented its natural resources, including critical minerals, to Senator Lindsey Graham in September 2024, but Ukraine delayed the deal until Trump&#x2019;s election in order to appeal to the president&#x2019;s business nature. Trump zeroed in on Ukraine&#x2019;s &#x201C;rare earths,&#x201D; although he likely meant critical minerals as Ukraine only has small deposits of rare earths, at the start of February. He said the minerals would be in exchange for American aid, claiming that Kyiv was ready to make a deal. Ukraine claims to have $12 trillion worth of minerals, including 22 types listed by the EU as &#x2018;critical,&#x2019; like titanium and lithium. In reality, the number is based on old Soviet-era estimations and Ukraine would need to carry out geological surveys to get a more accurate figure. Mineral deposits are also a state secret, despite calls to make them public. The Trump administration seemed aware that minerals may be a gamble. The first proposal presented by Bessent on Feb. 12, expanded its list of demands to include all natural resources. Zelenskly turned down the deal, stressing the need for security guarantees. Over the following days, the media leaked the details of the proposal sending shockwaves through Ukraine. Critics labeled the deal as &#x201C;colonial&#x201D; over its ask for 50% interest in resources and state-owned companies, including in the oil and gas sector. It also stated that &#x201C;for all future licenses, the U.S. will have the priority right to purchase exported minerals.&#x201D;Ukraine handed over its own proposal on Feb. 14 during a meeting with their American counterparts at the Munich Security Conference. The next day Zelensky said he wouldn&#x2019;t sign the agreement as it was &#x201C;not ready&#x201D; to protect Ukrainian interests. Over the following days, the U.S. ramped up its rhetoric. Trump labeled Zelensky &quot;a dictator&quot;and the White House was reportedly considering shutting off Starlink satellite terminals, which are critical for soldiers on the front line, unless Kyiv signed the agreement. This was later refuted by Starlink owner, billionaire Elon Musk. The White House sent Ukraine another version of the deal on the eve of Feb. 20, which then led to a lengthy overnight negotiation between Ukrainian and American officials.	https://kyivindependent.com/what-we-know-about-the-current-us-ukraine-minerals-deal/	2025-02-25T09:19:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199117207.jpg
1 killed, 14 injured in Russian attack on Kramatorsk	Russian forces attacked the city of Kramatorsk in Donetsk Oblast on Feb. 25, killing one person and injuring at least 14, including four children, Ukraine&apos;s National Police reported. A residential area came under attack at around 2:20 p.m., damaging at least 17 houses. Rescue operations are ongoing. &quot;We are identifying all the circumstances of the attack, the exact number of victims, and the extent of the damage,&quot; Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Kramatorsk, located about 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of the front line, remains a frequent target as Russian forces continue their offensive in the region. Russian artillery and airstrikes on settlements in Donetsk Oblast occur daily, often resulting in civilian casualties.	https://kyivindependent.com/1-killed-14-injured-in-russian-attack-on-kramatorsk/	2025-02-25T08:25:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-25_18-17-32-1.jpg
Poland pledges $210 million in new military aid for Ukraine	Poland is preparing its 46th military aid package for Ukraine worth 200 million euros ($210 million), Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said on Feb. 25, according to the Polish media outlet Interia. &quot;This is the forty-sixth contribution, and we will continue to help,&quot; Kosiniak-Kamysz said. Poland has been a key ally of Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, providing extensive military aid, including tanks, heavy equipment, and ammunition. The announcement comes amid the uncertainty of future aid from the U.S., which has been Ukraine&apos;s biggest supporter since 2022. Kosiniak-Kamysz didn&apos;t share what capabilities Poland&apos;s new military aid package will include aside from training. &quot;We will train the Ukrainian military,&quot; the minister said. &quot;Out of 80-90,000 soldiers trained by the EU countries, Poland has trained about a third &#x2014; 28,000 soldiers.&quot; Poland has delivered 45 military aid packages to Ukraine since 2022, totaling over $4 billion, according to former Ukrainian Ambassador to Poland Vasyl Zvarych. Despite Warsaw&apos;s ongoing support, Ukraine-Poland bilateral relations have been strained by trade disputes and historical grievances. Public support for military assistance to Ukraine in Poland has declined, with a Mieroszewski Center poll showing a drop from 54% to 49% throughout 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-pledges-210-million-in-new-military-aid-for-ukraine-defense-minister-says/	2025-02-25T08:09:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2079424446.jpg
US opposed Ukraine's UN resolution to avoid 'antagonizing' Russia, Rubio says	Washington voted against a UN resolution condemning Russian aggression against Ukraine because it contradicted U.S. efforts to bring both sides to the negotiating table, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Breitbart News on Feb. 24. &quot;We didn&apos;t feel it was conducive, frankly, to have something out there at the UN that&#x2019;s antagonistic to either side,&quot; Rubio said. He defended a separate U.S.-led resolution that avoided blaming Russia directly, calling it &quot;very fair language&quot; that states that &quot;war is a terrible thing.&quot; Rubio&apos;s comments come after the UN General Assembly vote on Kyiv&apos;s resolution on Feb. 24, the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, with 93 countries voting in favor and 18 against. The resolution, drafted by Kyiv and supported by all EU states except Hungary, reaffirms Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity and explicitly names Russia as the aggressor. The U.S., Israel, Hungary, Russia, and Belarus voted against it. On the same day, the UN Security Council passed a U.S.-drafted resolution, which calls for a swift end to the &quot;Russia-Ukraine conflict&quot; and avoids any criticism of Moscow&apos;s war of aggression. Out of the 15 members of the Security Council, 10 voted in favor, while the U.K., France, Denmark, Greece, and Slovenia abstained. Suspilne earlier reported that Washington sent letters to UN member states urging them to support the softer U.S. resolution, aligning with broader U.S. efforts to tone down language on Russia in international statements. The shift in tone comes as U.S. President Donald Trump pushes for a peace deal with Russia while increasingly criticizing Ukraine. Trump has called President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and falsely claimed that Ukraine started the war &#x2014; before later acknowledging that &quot;Russia attacked, but they shouldn&apos;t have let him attack.&quot; The Financial Times earlier reported that the U.S. also opposed referring to Russia as the aggressor in a G7 statement marking the war&apos;s anniversary.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-opposed-ukraines-un-resolution-to-avoid-antagonizing-russia-rubio-says/	2025-02-25T07:14:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194528244.jpg
UK to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, Starmer says	The U.K. aims to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced on Feb. 25 during a speech in the British Parliament. Starmer&apos;s statement comes amid growing uncertainty about the security situation in Europe, as the U.S. sends clear signals that the continent won&#x2019;t be able to rely on Washington for its security in the future. Starting in 2027, the UK will spend &#xA3;13.4 billion &#xA0;($17 billion) yearly on security needs. After the end of the parliament&apos;s term in 2029, it is expected to reach 3% of GDP, according to Starmer. It is the largest sustained increase in British defense spending since the end of the Cold War. &quot;(Vladimir) Putin thought he would weaken NATO. He has achieved the exact opposite,&quot; Starmer said. Due to the changes, the budget for foreign aid will have to be cut from this year&apos;s 0.5% of national income to 0.3% in 2027, Starmer added. &quot;It remains a cut, and I will not pretend otherwise. We will do everything we can to return to a world where that is not the case and rebuild a capability on development,&quot; Starmer said. &quot;But at times like this, the defense and security of the British people must always come first,&quot; he added. U.S. President Donald Trump previously urged NATO allies to increase their defense contributions beyond the current 2% benchmark, citing the need for Europe to take greater responsibility for its security amid Russia&apos;s ongoing full-scale war in Ukraine. Trump also blamed Ukraine for starting the war, saying Kyiv &quot;should have never started it&quot; and instead should have &quot;made a deal.&quot; Later, Trump added that President Volodymyr Zelensky is not essential to negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine and called him a &quot;dictator.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-plans-to-increase-defense-spending-to-2-5-of-gdp-by-2027-starmer-says/	2025-02-25T06:30:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2159996904.jpg
France could send nuclear-armed jets to Germany, Telegraph reports	France could deploy jet fighters equipped with nuclear weapons to Germany to send a &quot;strong message&quot; to Russia, the Telegraph reported on Feb. 24. The proposal comes as the U.S. shifts away from Europe and Ukraine, sending clear signals that the continent won&#x2019;t be able to rely on Washington for its security in the future. A French official speaking to the Telegraph said deploying fighter jets to Germany &quot;should not be difficult and would send a strong message,&quot; and would also pressure U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer to make a similar move. France is thought to have 300 nuclear weapons in its&apos; &apos;force de dissuasion&apos; program, with both sea and air-based launch systems. Meanwhile, the U.K.&apos;s Trident nuclear deterrent comprises four Vanguard-class submarines, each capable of carrying up to 16 warheads. The Telegraph report came on the same day that French President Emmanuel Macron met with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House where they discussed the future of support for Ukraine and possible peace negotiations. At a press conference after the pair met, Macron said that Europe needs U.S. support in any peace agreement &quot;because this is part of the credibility of security guarantees,&quot; but he also urged Europeans to take greater responsibility for safeguarding the continent. Before he met Trump, Macron talked to Friedrich Merz, who is expected to be Germany&apos;s next chancellor. Merz has also called on Britain and France to extend their nuclear protection as he seeks &quot;independence&quot; for Europe from the U.S. &quot;If those who really do not just make &apos;America first,&apos; but almost &apos;America alone&apos; their motto prevail, then it will be difficult,&quot; he said on Feb. 24. &quot;But I remain hopeful that we will succeed in maintaining the transatlantic relationship,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/france-could-send-nuclear-armed-jets-to-germany-telegraph-reports/	2025-02-25T06:05:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2191796999.jpg
Ukraine needs $524 billion for recovery, reconstruction after 3 years of Russia's full-scale war	The cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine after three years of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion will be $524 billion over the next decade, the U.N. reported on Feb. 25, citing data from Ukraine&apos;s government, the World Bank, the European Commission, and the U.N. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Russia has been attacking Ukrainian cities and villages daily, destroying residential buildings, critical infrastructure, cultural heritage sites, and sports venues, among other facilities. The required reconstruction costs are 2.8 times higher than Ukraine&apos;s nominal GDP for 2024, according to the report. Direct losses in Ukraine reached $176 billion at the end of December 2024 compared to $152 billion in February last year, the Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (RDNA4) by the World Bank estimated. Housing, transportation, energy, trade and industry, and education sectors have suffered the most from Russian attacks, the report read. Some 13% of Ukraine&apos;s total housing stock was damaged or destroyed, affecting over 2.5 million homes. In the energy sector, the number of damaged or destroyed assets, including production, transmission, distribution, and district heating infrastructure, increased by 70%. Donetsk, Kharkiv, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, and Kyiv oblasts sustained nearly 72% of the total damage.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-needs-524-billion-for-recovery-reconstruction-after-3-years-of-russias-full-scale-war/	2025-02-25T05:47:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1377903979.jpg
In calling Zelensky a ‘dictator without elections,’ Trump misunderstands democracy	After the top diplomats of Moscow and Washington met in Riyadh to discuss &#x201C;peace&#x201D; in Ukraine &#x2014; without Ukraine at the table &#x2014; the conversation quickly shifted to elections, as if they were the only topic discussed and the sole reason the war continues. And once again, U.S. President Donald Trump was at the center of the discourse. Beyond blaming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for starting the war and not ending it soon enough, Trump recently referred to him as a &#x201C;dictator without elections&#x201D; in a post on Truth Social. But in doing so, Trump wasn&#x2019;t just attacking a wartime leader &#x2014; he was promoting a deeply flawed understanding of democracy. His claims reflect a dangerous political mindset: electoralism, the notion that holding elections is the sole measure of democracy, regardless of whether institutions, public accountability, and the rule of law remain intact. Electoralism twists the truth. It provides a convenient justification for autocrats to present themselves as &#x201C;democratically elected&#x201D; while abusing power. At the same time, it undermines legitimate democracies, like Ukraine, when they make necessary, temporary deviations from the electoral cycle in times of crisis. And most ironically, it&#x2019;s a standard that Trump himself has never met. Let&#x2019;s start with the facts. Ukraine&#x2019;s constitution explicitly prohibits holding elections under martial law, which has been in place since Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022. This isn&#x2019;t a rule invented by Zelensky &#x2014; it&#x2019;s a necessity, recognized by both domestic and international legal experts. And from a purely practical standpoint, holding an election while a significant portion of the population is fighting for survival, many are in exile, and the majority live in fear would be neither free nor fair. History provides countless examples of elections being postponed during wartime. The most well-known case is the United Kingdom, which delayed its elections in 1940 to focus on battling Nazi Germany. None of this made Winston Churchill a dictator. Yet, according to Trump&#x2019;s logic, Zelensky&#x2019;s inability to hold elections makes him an authoritarian, despite Ukraine maintaining a free press, an independent judiciary, and ongoing debates about when and how elections should resume. Meanwhile, leaders like Putin and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb&#xE1;n &#x2014; whom Trump has openly praised &#x2014; continue to hold elections while consolidating power, silencing dissent, and rigging the system in their favor. If democracy is only about voting, why do these strongmen get a pass? Trump&#x2019;s call for democratic integrity might carry more weight if he weren&#x2019;t the last person who should be making it. This is the same man who tried to overturn a legitimate U.S. election in 2020, encouraged an insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, and still refuses to accept his own defeat. If anything, Trump&#x2019;s approach to democracy aligns much more closely with the leaders he claims to oppose. Like Putin, he undermines institutions when they don&#x2019;t serve his interests. Like Orb&#xE1;n, he tries to redefine democracy in ways that prioritize his hold on power rather than actual democratic principles. In his recent post on X, he even wrote a line that could have come from Lenin or Stalin: &#x201C;He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.&#x201D; And like many autocrats, he weaponizes democracy&#x2019;s own rhetoric to achieve the opposite of what it stands for. By calling Zelensky a dictator, Trump isn&#x2019;t defending democracy &#x2014; he&#x2019;s distorting it for political gain. Trump&#x2019;s labeling of Zelensky as a &#x201C;dictator without elections&#x201D; is more than just a verbal attack. It plays into Russian propaganda efforts, which have long sought to delegitimize Zelensky by portraying him as an unelected, Western-backed puppet. When a U.S. president amplifies that narrative, it weakens international support for Ukraine, fractures Western unity, and reinforces Russia&#x2019;s belief that Trump would be an ally to their cause. Beyond Ukraine, Trump&#x2019;s comments send a dangerous signal to global democracy. If the U.S. starts judging democracy solely by the presence of elections, it will allow authoritarian regimes to claim legitimacy simply by holding sham votes &#x2014; while penalizing legitimate democracies that make necessary adjustments during crises. That&#x2019;s a gift to strongmen from Moscow to Tehran. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky answers questions from the media during a press conference in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 23, 2025. (Kostiantyn Liberov / Libkos / Getty Images)If Trump truly believed democracy was only about elections, he would have accepted the results of 2020. If he truly believed that lacking an election makes someone a dictator, he would be far more critical of leaders who game the system to maintain permanent rule. But he doesn&#x2019;t. His attack on Zelensky isn&#x2019;t about democracy &#x2014; it&#x2019;s about politics. It&#x2019;s about shaping public opinion against continued U.S. support for Ukraine and laying the groundwork for a future in which the U.S. aligns more with authoritarian powers than democratic allies. Trump&#x2019;s claims demand more than just fact-checking. They require a deeper discussion about what democracy actually means &#x2014; and how its enemies, foreign and domestic, are trying to redefine it for their own benefit. The question isn&#x2019;t whether Ukraine is a democracy. It is. The real question is: Who benefits from pretending it isn&#x2019;t? The answer is clear: those who want to attack democratic institutions, normalize autocratic rule, and justify their own attacks on democratic norms. If the U.S. allows electoralism to define democracy, it will not only abandon Ukraine &#x2014; it will undermine its own democratic resilience. And that would be a victory for the very forces democracy was meant to resist.

In negotiations with Russia, Trump is repeating his ‘complete disaster’ peace deal with Taliban	Donald Trump is elected U.S. president after criticizing a war abroad and calling for its end. He negotiates a deal with an adversary of the United States under heavy sanctions, cutting an ally out of their own country&#x2019;s peace talks. The disastrous deal is viewed as a surrender to the opposition, prioritizing ending the conflict quickly over supporting U.S. allies or long-term stability in the region. If that sounds familiar, that&#x2019;s because it&#x2019;s what happened in Afghanistan during Trump&#x2019;s first term in office, and what Ukrainians and their partners fear may be happening to them now. When Trump began promising on the campaign trail to end the war in Ukraine, U.K. parliamentary member Mark Martin saw &#x201C;loads of similarities&#x201D; to how Trump ended the war in Afghanistan. &#x201C;The deal wasn&#x2019;t a deal, it was a capitulation,&#x201D; said Martin, who served in Afghanistan and wrote An Intimate War, a book on the conflict. &#x201C;And that&#x2019;s what Trump&#x2019;s trying to engineer here (in Ukraine).&#x201D; In February 2020, Trump&#x2019;s team signed an agreement with the Taliban, ending two decades of U.S. involvement in the war in Afghanistan. The Afghan government at the time &#x2014; a partner of the U.S. &#x2014; was excluded from negotiations. The subsequent withdrawal of U.S. troops, despite the Taliban&#x2019;s failure to adhere to its side of the agreement, was a key factor in the shocking takeover of Kabul by the Taliban in 2021. Though no comparison is exact, &#x201C;what&#x2019;s the same is the core instinct of the American leadership &#x2014; to reach out to the enemy and just give away the family jewels,&#x201D; said Martin. Since taking office, Trump and his staff have alarmed Ukrainian officials with their negotiating stance towards Russia. Immediately, officials appeared to undermine Ukraine&#x2019;s negotiating leverage by saying NATO membership was not an option and restoring Ukraine&#x2019;s borders was &#x201C;an unrealistic objective.&#x201D; An especially concerning development was a February meeting in Saudi Arabia between U.S. and Russian officials, to which Ukraine and Europe were not invited. Earlier this week, Trump said that it was &#x201C;not important&#x201D; for Zelensky to be present during the negotiations.

(Evelyn Hockstein / AFP via Getty Images)Of course, the United States had troops deployed in Afghanistan for two decades fighting a Taliban insurgency alongside Afghan Army troops, while Ukraine is fighting a land invasion by a sovereign nation without any U.S. boots on the ground. The deal with the Taliban also centered on ending U.S. involvement, not the entire conflict. However, the U.S. agreement signed with the Taliban in Doha was the only other peace deal Trump negotiated and is instructive in what his isolationist rhetoric looks like in practice. Many experts see clear parallels with the way peace talks are unfolding today. The lesson for Ukrainians, warns Martin, is clear: &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t rely on America. Find other allies.&#x201D; Trump had railed against the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan on social media and called for a withdrawal as far back as 2011. By the time Trump was inaugurated in 2017, almost 2,400 Americans had died serving in Afghanistan since the initial invasion in 2001. Trump began his efforts to directly negotiate with the Taliban in 2018 and appointed Zalmay Khalilzad as his special advisor tasked with facilitating talks. Meeting in Qatar, Khalilzad and Taliban representatives opened up peace talks, though they excluded the Afghan government at the Taliban&#x2019;s demand. &#x201C;The Afghan government was completely excluded. They were cut out,&#x201D; said Tim Willasey-Wilsey, a visiting professor at War Studies at King&apos;s College and former British diplomat. &#x201C;This is the same playbook (in Ukraine). Zelensky is out and Europe is out.&#x201D; John Bolton, Trump&#x2019;s national security advisor at the time of the Doha deal, was also frozen out of the Afghanistan talks once Trump realized Bolton didn&#x2019;t support his plans for a quick withdrawal at the expense of stability.

(Wakil Kohsar / AFP / Getty Images)This precedent bodes poorly for those hoping that U.S. officials who oppose Russia, like State Secretary Marco Rubio, might steer Trump away from siding with Moscow, Willasey-Wilsey added. Already, Keith Kellogg, Trump&#x2019;s current special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, was absent from recent U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia. There has been no indication from the Trump Administration that he will attend future rounds, and some experts argue he is actively being sidelined due to his relatively pro-Ukraine stance. In February 2020, during Trump&#x2019;s previous presidency, the Taliban signed a deal with the United States in Doha, Qatar. The U.S. promised to withdraw its troops within 14 months and signaled it would lift economic sanctions, while the Taliban agreed to not attack U.S. troops, eventually open talks with the Afghan government, and to prevent terrorist groups from operating in Taliban-controlled territory. The deal signed in Doha had secret agreements that were not publicized, leaving Afghan President Ashraf Ghani confused about exactly what the U.S. president had promised his foe. Meanwhile, the Taliban violated its pledges almost immediately. It escalated violent attacks and maintained ties with terrorist groups. Rather than holding the Taliban accountable, the Trump administration continued with its pledge to withdraw troops.

But in terms of the general behavior of Trump towards negotiations, I think it&#x2019;s very instructive,&#x201D; said Willasey-Wilsey. &#x201C;All Trump wanted was to say, &#x2018;I got out of Afghanistan.&#x2019; The details didn&#x2019;t really matter,&#x201D; said Willasey-Wilsey, calling his negotiating tactics a &#x201C;complete disaster.&#x201D; &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve got such short memories. It was only four years ago. But we should have remembered how this man operates,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;It&apos;s a bit of a condemnation of all of us that we weren&apos;t really ready.&#x201D; Trump&#x2019;s successor, Joe Biden, inherited the Doha deal and decided to see through the U.S. commitment. Within weeks of Biden&#x2019;s announcement in April 2021 that the war in Afghanistan would end and a full withdrawal was on track, violence surged and the Taliban began to rapidly conquer huge swaths of land &#x2014; culminating in a deadly and chaotic evacuation of more than a hundred thousand people from the main airport in Kabul. The poorly planned withdrawal has remained a stain on Joe Biden&#x2019;s legacy, but many in the U.S. and abroad have forgotten the role of Trump&#x2019;s negotiation priorities in laying the groundwork for one of Washington&#x2019;s worst foreign policy failures in recent history. Many from Trump&#x2019;s administration distanced themselves from the deal in the aftermath, and critics have seen it as an effective surrender. Should the Ukraine deal similarly fall apart, Trump may again try to blame anyone but himself, said Willasey-Wilsey: &#x201C;If the thing goes horribly wrong in two or three years&apos; time, because Putin kicks off again, and if the guarantees are hopeless, which they will be, he&apos;ll blame Biden, he&apos;ll blame the Europeans.&#x201D; U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in the Oval Office in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 24, 2025. (Bonnie Cash / UPI / Bloomberg / Getty Images)Trump blamed Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris for the &#x201C;humiliation in Afghanistan&#x201D; as recently as last year. Yet a review led by the U.S. National Security Council found that Biden&#x2019;s actions were constrained by the Doha deal, and placed the blame on Trump. &#x201C;The (Afghanistan) deal itself was highly flawed,&#x201D; said Philippe Lefevre, associate director of the University of Surrey&#x2019;s Centre for Britain and Europe. &#x201C;It gave everything to the Taliban with no real response back. The Taliban immediately reneged on the deal. There was no ability or mechanism for the U.S. or NATO forces in Afghanistan to hold them accountable.&#x201D; &#x201C;That is the same fear here&#x201D; in Ukraine, added Lefevre, &#x201C;that you will be giving (Russian President Vladimir) Putin everything he wants. He can promise whatever he wants. But if he reneges &#x2014; and my belief is he wants to renege &#x2014; what can you do?&#x201D; Both the Taliban and Putin have a track record of human rights violations, noted Lefevre, and have undermined their credibility during negotiations. Russia&#x2019;s 2022 full-scale invasion, for example, was a blatant violation of the Minsk Agreements signed in 2014 and 2015 after Russian military offensives in Ukraine&apos;s Donbas. In his negotiations, Zelensky has tried to protect against potential violations of a future agreement by maintaining that any ceasefire must come with security assurances. Zelensky recently provided U.S. officials with a list of more than two dozen times that he says Russia violated ceasefires negotiated between 2014 and 2022. Even Khalilzad, who negotiated the deal in Doha that led to Afghanistan&#x2019;s collapse, has chimed in on the issue. In a post on X on Feb. 18, Khalilzad wrote that &#x201C;credible security guarantees to deter future Russian invasions&#x201D; and &#x201C;a peace-keeping force&#x201D; are necessary for a permanent end to the war in Ukraine, perhaps drawing on his experience with Afghanistan. Zelensky has maintained that Ukraine will not accept any deal negotiated without its participation. And, since Trump is seeking an end to fighting involving Zelensky&#x2019;s forces &#x2014; rather than just a withdrawal of U.S. troops &#x2014; Zelensky&#x2019;s involvement can&#x2019;t be ignored as easily as in Afghanistan. Either way, Trump officials have made it clear that they want a deal quickly and have suggested that one is already &#x201C;close.&#x201D; A press secretary for the administration said it could arrive as soon as this week, while Moscow said it is open to a ceasefire only if the agreement &#x201C;suits&#x201D; Russia. One of the biggest differences between Afghanistan and Ukraine may also be one of the biggest hopes for Kyiv to avoid repeating the mistakes in Kabul, according to Lefevre: the role of other European countries. &#x201C;Europe has a much larger ability to manage this withdrawal, has a much larger interest in successfully bolstering Ukraine during this potential withdrawal, and could and should help Ukraine push back against some of the worst aspects of the negotiations,&#x201D; said Lefevre. Among the most egregious aspects, he said, is the discussion to transfer Ukrainian mineral rights and natural resources to the U.S., which is &#x201C;clearly one-sided.&#x201D; The U.S. has reportedly pressured Ukraine to give up $500 billion of its natural resources as repayment for American aid to Ukraine, which was given without the expectation of repayment. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy answers questions during a press conference in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 23, 2025. (Kostiantyn Liberov / Libkos / Getty Images)Zelensky has thus far refused, noting that the proposed agreement fails to provide any security guarantees and vastly outweighs the $100 billion provided by the U.S. Kellogg has said that Europe will not be directly included in peace negotiations but its interests will be taken into account. So far, Europe has vocally called for Ukraine&#x2019;s and its own inclusion in peace talks, is continuing to provide aid, and is reportedly forming a plan to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not an inevitability that there is a withdrawal like Afghanistan, but it is up to Europeans to make sure that&#x2019;s the case,&#x201D; said Lefevre. &#x201C;The Europeans must be far more prepared to go it alone. We were not prepared to go it alone in Kabul.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/in-negotiations-with-russia-trump-is-repeating-his-complete-disaster-peace-deal-with-taliban/	2025-02-25T04:34:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1240566522.jpg
How North Korea’s role in Russia’s war undermines the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty	The nuclear dimension has been a key aspect of the Russo-Ukrainian War since its onset in February 2014. Behavior in this war, not just of Moscow and Kyiv but of other states as well, has been conditioned by Russia&#x2019;s possession and Ukraine&#x2019;s lack of weapons of mass destruction. Russia holds the world&#x2019;s largest arsenal of nuclear warheads, while Ukraine has no weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Since 2014, Moscow has repeatedly reminded the world of its destructive nuclear power. In November 2024, the Kremlin publicly amended Russia&#x2019;s military doctrine, lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons to make its nuclear threats more credible. In contrast, Kyiv agreed in 1994 to give up its inherited Soviet-era atomic arms and all related delivery systems in exchange for promises from the U.S., U.K., France, Russia, and China never to attack or threaten Ukraine (under the Budapest Memorandum), leaving it without nuclear deterrence capability today. This situation is oddly legitimized, supported, and protected by international law. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) allows Russia, as an official nuclear-weapon state, to possess nuclear weapons. The NPT also explicitly forbids Ukraine, as a non-nuclear weapon state, from doing the same. Ukraine&#x2019;s non-atomic allies are similarly bound by the NPT to remain conventional military powers in supporting Ukraine. Having already defied international law and the Helsinki Final Act with its territorial expansions into Moldova, Georgia, and Ukraine, Moscow is further undermining the logic of the non-proliferation regime and the letter of the NPT with its nuclear posturing. The NPT&#x2019;s preamble prescribes that &quot;States must refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State.&quot; In particular, the use or threat of force by a nuclear-weapon state against a non-nuclear-weapon state is inadmissible. Russia further made a promise, under the NPT acquis, to refrain from the threat or use of force against Ukraine in exchange for joining the treaty as a non-nuclear-weapon state. The logic of nuclear non-proliferation is now further under attack through North Korea&#x2019;s involvement in the Russo-Ukrainian War. Since 2023, Russia has increasingly relied on North Korea, a state that violated the NPT in order to build its own atomic arsenal, in its assault on Ukraine. After already supplying military equipment and ammunition, Pyongyang deepened its collaboration with Moscow in the fall of 2024 by sending regular troops to fight against Ukraine. These North Korean military units have engaged in direct combat with Ukrainian forces and suffered significant casualties. North Korea&#x2019;s involvement is expanding the war&#x2019;s scope into a global conflagration. North Korea violated and then withdrew from the NPT in 2003, long before it entered a European war. Subsequent to its departure, Pyongyang revealed its nuclear weapon program, and it has since freely developed and tested atomic arms and their delivery systems. In fact, North Korea had already violated the NPT while still a party to the Treaty, flouting international consequences, including UN sanctions. Today, North Korea is one of four nuclear-weapon states outside the NPT, along with India, Pakistan, and Israel. Nonetheless, North Korea&#x2019;s change in status in 2003 does not diminish the importance of its participation, through weapon deliveries and the deployment of thousands of troops, in Russia&#x2019;s war on Ukraine. Neither Moscow&#x2019;s initiation of hostilities in 2014 nor Pyongyang&#x2019;s full entry into the war 10 years later has lessened the NPT&#x2019;s absolute restriction on Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to seek nuclear deterrence. By observing the NPT, Ukraine is now disadvantaged in the face of two nuclear-armed states: Russia, an official nuclear-weapon state, and North Korea, a de facto nuclear-weapon state outside the NPT. This novel situation puts even more pressure on the purpose of the NPT than was already the case during the bilateral phase of the Russo-Ukrainian War from 2014 to 2023. Treaty implementation by Ukraine and its non-nuclear allies now puts them at risk with Russia, one of the NPT&#x2019;s official nuclear-weapon states, while restricting their maneuvering room in relation to the war waged against Ukraine by North Korea. Ukraine is being attacked by nuclear-armed states with different legal statuses and losing its internationally recognized state territory to an official nuclear-weapon state, with no recourse in the context of the NPT to address this unprecedented situation. People watch a television screen showing a news broadcast with file footage of a North Korean missile test at a railway station in Seoul, South Korea, on July 22, 2023. (Jung Yeon-je / AFP via Getty Images)North Korea&#x2019;s violation of and absence from the non-proliferation regime as well as possession of atomic arms have given it freedom of international action. The Russian-North Korean alliance further undermines the NPT by showing that nuclearization need not have consequences and can even result in more security benefits. This lesson is surely being studied closely in capitals such as Seoul, Taipei, and Tokyo. In contrast, Ukraine&#x2019;s observance of the NPT limits its ability to defend itself against Russia and North Korea, within the right of states to defend themselves as defined under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. North Korea&#x2019;s new relationship with Russia also touches on other Russian obligations under the NPT. In June 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Treaty, which entered into force in December 2024. It includes a promise to defend each other in case of an armed attack, which could involve the use of nuclear weapons by either Russia or North Korea. Both sides also committed to opposing &quot;the application of unilateral compulsory measures including those that assume extraterritorial nature&quot; and Russia pledged to support North Korean interests in &#x201C;the United Nations and its specialized agencies,&#x201D; which includes the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Institute for the Study of War has described the new situation in this way: &#x201C;...Russia has abandoned its past opposition to North Korea&#x2019;s nuclear program. It vetoed a UN resolution to tighten sanctions on North Korea in 2022 and another resolution to extend the mandate of the UN sanctions monitoring committee on North Korea in 2024, effectively ending UN sanctions compliance monitoring.&#x201D; Although still officially a nuclear-weapon state, Russia no longer upholds sanctions on North Korea that it had introduced as a permanent member of the UN Security Council in response to, among others, North Korea&#x2019;s development of nuclear weapons outside the NPT. Instead, Moscow has legitimized Pyongyang&#x2019;s right to possess nuclear weapons. Russia&#x2019;s Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, said in September 2024 that &quot;applying the term &#x2018;denuclearization&#x2019; to (the) DPRK (Democratic People&#x2019;s Republic of Korea) no longer makes any sense. For us, this is off the table.&quot; The nuclear non-proliferation regime emerged with the entry into force of the NPT in 1970. It has since drawn its legitimacy from being an all-encompassing agreement of today 191 states aimed at preventing nuclear war and proliferation, while also ensuring that nuclear-weapon states do not use or threaten to use atomic arms against non-nuclear-weapon states in good standing with their NPT obligations. Since 2014, however, the NPT has inadvertently provided cover for Russia, an NPT-defined nuclear-weapon state and permanent member of the UN Security Council, to carry out expansionist and genocidal policies against Ukraine, an official non-nuclear-weapon state. Since 2023, moreover, the NPT has put the signatory states Ukraine and its non-nuclear allies in a disadvantageous position vis-a-vis Russia&#x2019;s nuclear-armed ally North Korea. The solution to this paradoxical situation is that all NPT signatory states interested in a continuation of the non-proliferation regime should provide Kyiv with as much as possible conventional military and non-military help in order to enable the Ukrainian armed forces to repel Russia&#x2019;s and North Korea&#x2019;s attack on the logic of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. &#xA0; Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article is based on a longer Stockholm Centre for Eastern European Studies (SCEEUS) commentary.

I was tired' — Serbia's president apologises for accidentally backing Ukraine's UN resolution	Serbia erroneously voted in favor of a Ukrainian resolution at the U.N. General Assembly calling Russia an aggressor state, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on Feb. 24, RTS reported. The U.N. General Assembly approved the resolution on Feb. 24 condemning Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, with 93 countries voting in favor and 18 against, including the U.S. Serbia was supposed to abstain from voting on the Ukrainian resolution, Vucic said. &quot;I believe that Serbia made a mistake today. I apologize to the citizens of Serbia for that, and I take the blame for that because I was probably tired and overwhelmed,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn&apos;t have time to deal with this (issue) enough, maybe I&apos;m too tired, maybe I have too many things (to deal with)... I don&apos;t think we should pander to any power, neither Russians nor Americans. I think it was in the interest of the state of Serbia. Unfortunately, it didn&apos;t happen,&quot; he added. Serbia maintains a friendly attitude toward Russia and has refused to join international sanctions against Moscow in the wake of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. At the same time, Vucic has called Ukraine a &quot;friendly country&quot; and previously affirmed that Crimea and Donbas are Ukrainian sovereign territories. Vucic expected his vote error would also result in him &quot;losing favor or political points in the EU.&quot; The Ukrainian resolution explicitly names Russia as the aggressor state and demands the complete withdrawal of troops. The American version of the resolution did not explicitly mention Russia as an aggressor, but after amendments from the EU countries, the document included the wording &quot;Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.&quot; The U.S. abstained from voting after these changes, while Russia opposed it. Both resolutions were adopted.	https://kyivindependent.com/serbia-mistakenly-backs-ukrainian-resolution-on-russias-war-at-un-general-assembly-vucic-says/	2025-02-25T04:14:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2189211336.jpg
Peace in Ukraine must look like Korea, not Vichy	Peace is an attractive, yet elusive, concept. It can mean different things to different people at different times. Ukraine is a case in point. The quest for peace could yield either of two fundamentally different outcomes: a Vichy-style capitulation, perhaps with an interim ceasefire that buys Russia more time to rearm and prepare its next attack, or a robust defense of a frozen front line, as one finds on the Korean Peninsula today. The Kremlin&#x2019;s vision for peace in Ukraine is clear. Russian forces would directly occupy swaths of illegally seized Ukrainian territory, and a compliant, helpless Ukrainian government (lacking any meaningful military capacity) would take orders from Moscow. Something quite similar happened in France during World War II, when the part of the country not under direct German occupation was run by General Philippe P&#xE9;tain&#x2019;s collaborationist government and took orders from Berlin. Thus, for most of World War II &#x2014; roughly between 1940 and 1944 &#x2014; the situation on the ground in France was &#x201C;peaceful.&#x201D; The Vichy regime under P&#xE9;tain regularly boasted that it had protected France, while blaming the Resistance &#x2014; French guerrillas (&quot;maquis&quot;) &#x2014; and periodic Allied bombing raids for any disturbances to the &#x201C;peace.&#x201D; This option has been on offer for Ukraine since the first hours of Russia&#x2019;s large-scale invasion. Yet having witnessed the executions, rapes, and other atrocities committed by Russian forces against civilians in Bucha and elsewhere, the Ukrainians have understandably refused to capitulate. The alternative is the type of peace that kept Germany peaceful for decades after World War II, and kept the Korean Peninsula peaceful since the 1953 armistice. In each case, the peace was secured by accepting de facto borders, which were fortified with massive defensive military buildups, boots on the ground, and credible security guarantees. While West Germany enjoyed NATO membership after 1955, South Korea relied on a bilateral alliance with the United States. Even today, the U.S. keeps around 28,000 active-duty troops in South Korea and 50,000 in Germany. Such backstops made the former wartime front line almost impregnable, allowing each rump state to consolidate, develop, and remain at peace. The equivalent of a West German or South Korean model for Ukraine today would require a freezing of the front line and either NATO accession or a deployment of tens of thousands of Western troops to its Ukrainian territory. The French government has pushed for this kind of solution since February 2024, and it now features prominently in discussions among European leaders. With the new U.S. administration demanding that Europe do more to ensure its own peace and security, at least a half-dozen European governments are said to be seriously considering it. Of course, if Europeans dislike the first model (a Vichy-style peace) but prove unable to deliver a sufficient security guarantee, that will create the conditions for a third possible scenario: a bogus peace leading to another war. A temporary ceasefire &#x2014; like the one that prevailed under the Minsk agreements after 2014 &#x2014; would allow Russia to regroup, rearm, and attack again sooner rather than later. Not only might this cycle be repeated more than once; it also could implicate countries beyond Ukraine &#x2014; such as the Baltics or Poland. Thus, if Ukraine does not get enough support in the coming months and years, Europe will find itself confronting a dangerous new strategic reality, one that would challenge NATO solidarity and leave EU territory perpetually vulnerable. With enough prodding and hybrid warfare, Russia could test the limits of NATO&#x2019;s mutual defense guarantee and either expose it as a dead letter or precipitate a direct military confrontation between nuclear powers. Such would be the consequences of a bogus peace. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio (C), U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz (R) and U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff attend an interview after meeting with Russian officials in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Feb. 18, 2025. (Evelyn Hockstein / AFP via Getty Images)The immediate task for Europe, then, is not only to navigate U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s unilateral pursuit of a settlement with Russia that could offer Ukraine on a platter to Russia, but also to ensure that any deal does not increase the likelihood of an even wider war in the near future. Many Europeans think that if Russia could not conquer Ukraine in 2022, Russia would not dare challenge NATO and the European Union. That is dangerously wishful thinking. Occupying most of Ukraine would not only allow Russia to expand its territory, but also allow it to unite Europe&#x2019;s biggest and second-biggest armies, under Kremlin command. Occupied territories bring in new people, defense production capacities, and resources &#x2014; from rare-earth minerals to gas and nuclear power plants. Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industrial capacity &#x2014; which has been impressive in multiple areas, from sea drones to the shear capacity to produce equipment en masse &#x2014; would be a welcome bonus for Russia as well, and it could be used against Europe. French President Emmanuel Macron already publicly warned that the combined armed forces of Russia and Ukraine would be unstoppable. The bottom line is that avoiding a Ukrainian capitulation or a fake peace will require a European commitment to, at the very least, freezing the current frontline. Otherwise, vulnerable EU and NATO members could be the next targets. European public opinion must wake up to the reality that the only alternative is something that no one wants: a perpetual threat of war for much of Central and Northern Europe, with all the security and economic uncertainty that comes with it.

Russia will not be readmitted to G7, German finance minister says, rebuffing Trump	Russia will not be readmitted to the Group of Seven (G7), Germany&apos;s finance minister, Joerg Kukies, told Reuters on Feb. 25, despite U.S. President Donald Trump saying he would &quot;love&quot; to see it happen. &quot;The condemnation of the G7 of Russia&apos;s war of aggression is very clear, especially on the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s brutal attack,&quot; Kukies said. Trump said on Feb. 13 that he would &quot;love&quot; to see Russia readmitted into the G7, calling Russia&apos;s 2014 expulsion from the group a &quot;mistake.&quot; &quot;I&apos;d love to have them back. I think it was a mistake to throw them out,&quot; Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. &quot;Look, it&apos;s not a question of liking Russia or not liking Russia. It was the G8,&quot; Trump said, referring to the former name of the international forum. Then-Group of Eight (G8) countries expelled Russia from the group in 2014 after it invaded parts of eastern Ukraine and annexed Crimea. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, G7 countries have collectively supported Ukraine with military and financial aid. But cracks have been showing in recent days after the U.S.&apos;s abrupt shift away from Ukraine since Trump took office last month. The G7 is still discussing a joint statement on the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine due to disagreements with the U.S., Reuters reported on Feb. 25, citing Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly. &quot;We&apos;ve been working, indeed, with the Europeans and Americans. We are still having some conversations,&quot; Joly said during the briefing when asked about the statement&apos;s status. Joly&apos;s statement comes after the U.S. joined Russia and Belarus in voting against a U.N. resolution condemning Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion on Feb. 24. &quot;Canada and other countries don&apos;t agree with the position that the U.S. advocated at the UN, particularly the resolution they brought up,&quot; Joly said. Washington also opposes the wording &quot;Russian aggression&quot; in any joint G7 statement on the war, according to Reuters.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-will-not-be-readmitted-to-g7-german-finance-minister-says-rebuffing-trump/	2025-02-25T04:01:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201260761.jpg
Ukraine passes resolution on elections when there is 'sustainable peace' at 2nd attempt	Ukraine&apos;s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, passed a resolution on Feb. 25 to hold elections after &quot;a comprehensive, just, and sustainable peace is secured&quot; in the country, lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said. The decision was supported by 268 members of parliament (MPs), while 12 abstained, according to Zhelezniak. A day earlier, the parliament lacked the votes to approve the resolution on its first attempt. The resolution to &quot;support for democracy in Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression&quot; stipulates that elections cannot be held under martial law, emphasizing the &quot;need for continuity of leadership&quot; in such circumstances. The resolution comes after U.S. President Donald Trump called President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; in a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Feb. 19, accusing him of refusing to hold elections, and repeating false claims about the war in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin is the only one who is responsible for making it impossible to hold &quot;free, transparent, and democratic elections&quot; in Ukraine with the participation of international observers, the resolution states. &quot;Martial law in Ukraine, introduced in response to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, does not allow for elections by Ukraine&apos;s Constitution of Ukraine. At the same time, the Ukrainian people are united in the opinion that such elections should be held after the war&apos;s end,&quot; the parliament declared. Russia has widely used the claim that Zelensky is illegitimate in its propaganda to discredit the Ukrainian government. The false claim is based on the premise that Zelensky&apos;s first term in office was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024. But Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and the subsequent declaration of martial law in Ukraine has meant elections have been impossible to hold, and his term has been extended, something constitutional lawyers say is allowed under Ukrainian law.	https://kyivindependent.com/parliament-passes-resolution-on-elections-when-there-is-sustainable-peace-at-2nd-attempt/	2025-02-25T03:26:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167201231.jpg
Second round of Saudi Arabia talks with US not happening today, Russia says	Russia&apos;s foreign ministry has said none of its representatives are scheduled to meet their U.S. counterparts in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 25, Russian state media RIA Novosti reported. The statement comes after Euronews reported on Feb. 22 that U.S. President Donald Trump had announced a second round of talks on how to end the war in Ukraine. The first round of talks on Feb. 18 in Saudi Arabia marked the first direct negotiations between the U.S. and Russia since Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion began, with Russia&apos;s delegation, led by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, sitting down with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials. Ukraine was not invited to participate. Following the initial meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlined three main objectives both sides had agreed to pursue. These include restoring embassy staff in Washington and Moscow, creating a high-level team to facilitate Ukraine peace talks, and exploring ways to strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries. Meanwhile, Russia&#x2019;s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said that preparations are underway for a potential face-to-face meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Speaking to Russian state media, Ryabkov said such a summit could cover a broad range of global issues beyond the war in Ukraine. He emphasized the need to &quot;move toward normalizing relations&quot; and address &quot;the most acute and potentially very, very dangerous situations, of which there are many, Ukraine among them.&quot; Ryabkov claimed that plans for the summit remain in the early stages and would require &quot;the most intensive preparatory work&quot; to materialize. He added that U.S. and Russian envoys may hold another meeting within the next two weeks to prepare for further high-level discussions. President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected any potential outcome from the talks, stressing that Kyiv was not included in the discussions. European allies have also voiced concerns over being sidelined in the negotiations, raising further doubts about the legitimacy of the ongoing diplomatic efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/second-round-of-saudi-arabia-talks-with-us-not-happening-today-russia-says/	2025-02-25T03:07:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199670497.jpg
G7 still discussing joint statement on Russia's full-scale invasion due to disagreement with US	The Group of Seven nations (G7) is still discussing a joint statement on the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine due to disagreements with the U.S., Reuters reported on Feb. 25, citing Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly. &quot;We&apos;ve been working, indeed, with the Europeans and Americans.

Washington also opposes the wording &quot;Russian aggression&quot; in any joint G7 statement on the war, according to Reuters. &quot;It is a fluid situation, and we&apos;ll continue to engage, but I&apos;ve been foreign minister now for three years and a half, and it&apos;s never been so intense in terms of diplomatic engagement, to say the least,&quot; Joly added. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz both declined to explicitly name Russia as the aggressor in Fox News interviews. Hegseth referred to the war as &quot;a very complicated situation&quot; when asked if Russia attacked Ukraine unprovoked. U.S. President Donald Trump also chose not to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a dictator while responding to journalists on the sidelines of a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron on Feb. 24. Trump called the Ukrainian leader a &quot;dictator&quot; in a post on his social media platform Truth Social, accusing him of refusing to hold elections and repeating false claims about the war in Ukraine. Yet, Trump&apos;s remarks disregard Ukraine&apos;s constitution, which prohibits elections under martial law, and echoed the narratives of Russian propaganda.	https://kyivindependent.com/g7-still-discussing-joint-statement-on-anniversary-of-full-scale-invasion-due-to-disagreement-with-us/	2025-02-25T02:20:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201807339.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 2, injure 36 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed two civilians and injured 36 others over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 25. The Russian military regularly attacks Ukrainian cities and villages with drones, missiles, glide bombs, and artillery. Despite overwhelming evidence, the Russian government has denied that its army is targeting civilians. In Sumy Oblast, Russia struck the Sumy community with a drone, injuring two people overnight on Feb. 25, the local military administration reported. The day prior, Russia targeted the Velykapysarivka community with artillery, drones, and mortars. One person was killed, and two others were injured in the attacks. In the Myropillia community, Russian forces struck the settlements with a glide bomb, drones, and mortars, injuring three civilians. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian strikes killed one person and injured two others in the town of Sloviansk. In Kramatorsk, two people suffered injuries and one person was injured in Kostiantynivka. One civilian was also injured in the attack against the village of Fedorivka, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 34 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, over the past day. As a result of the attacks, 13 people, including a child, were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. As of Feb. 25 morning, Russian forces struck Kherson again, injuring a 63-year-old man. He suffered a shrapnel wound to his leg and an explosive injury. In Kharkiv Oblast, a Russian glide bomb struck the town of Derhachi, injuring four women, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. Russian forces also attacked the village of Tsupivka, injuring four civilians. In Kyiv Oblast, Russian forces attacked several settlements with drones. A 44-year-old woman suffered leg injuries in the Obukhiv district, the local military administration reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-2-injure-36-over-past-day/	2025-02-25T02:06:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-25-10_05_52.jpeg
EU offers Ukraine 'mutually beneficial' minerals deal, despite Trump saying US version close to signing	The EU has offered Ukraine its own deal on the country&apos;s natural resources, describing it as &quot;mutually beneficial&quot; and a &quot;win-win partnership,&quot; AFP reported on Feb. 24. The European Commissioner for industrial strategy, Stephane Sejourne, said he&apos;d offered Kyiv an alternative to that proposed by the U.S. while on a visit to Ukraine to mark the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Negotiations on a deal to entrench U.S. interests in Ukraine&apos;s reserves are ongoing, with the latest draft presented by the White House reportedly demanding $500 billion of Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, including critical minerals, to recuperate American aid to Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky has so far refused to sign the deal because it does not contain any security guarantees for Ukraine and because the $500 billion sum vastly outnumbers the $100 billion provided under former President Joe Biden as a grant. &quot;Twenty-one of the 30 critical materials Europe needs can be provided by Ukraine in a win-win partnership,&quot; Sejourne said. &quot;The added value Europe offers is that we will never demand a deal that&apos;s not mutually beneficial.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump previously reiterated his push for a deal between the U.S. and Ukraine, arguing that it would help Kyiv&apos;s economy while ensuring that Washington &quot;recoups the tens of billions of dollars and military equipment sent to Ukraine.&quot; During a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House, Trump said he may soon meet President Volodymyr Zelensky to sign the agreement.

US, Ukraine close to signing deal on minerals worth 'hundreds of billions of dollars,' Axios reports	Ukraine and the U.S. are close to signing a deal on rare earths worth &quot;hundreds of billions of dollars,&quot; Axios reported on Feb. 24 after receiving a draft of the document. Negotiations on a deal to entrench U.S. interests in Ukraine&apos;s reserves are ongoing, with the latest draft presented by the White House reportedly demanding $500 billion of Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, including critical minerals, to recuperate American aid to Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky has so far refused to sign the deal because it does not contain any security guarantees for Ukraine and because the $500 billion sum vastly outnumbers the $100 billion provided under former President Joe Biden as a grant. According to the draft obtained by Axios, the U.S. would express its desire to keep Ukraine &quot;free, sovereign and secure.&quot; Yet the document does not provide for any military commitments on Washington&apos;s part. The draft deal includes establishing a &quot;Reconstruction Investment Fund&quot; jointly managed by Washington and Kyiv. The fund will be reportedly created to &quot;invest in projects in Ukraine and attract investments to increase development,&quot; including in areas like mining and ports. The U.S. will also be able to reimburse part of its costs associated with &quot;defending, reconstructing, and returning Ukraine&quot; to pre-war GDP levels, according to the agreement&apos;s text. The deal also includes provisions for the territories currently under Russian occupation. Much of Ukraine&apos;s rare mineral resources have been under Russian control since the beginning of the war. An unnamed Ukrainian official told Axios that the agreement could be signed as early as March 3. The source added that the document obtained by Axios is the latest version but may be subject to amendments. U.S. President Donald Trump previously reiterated his push for a deal between the U.S. and Ukraine, arguing that it would help Kyiv&apos;s economy while ensuring that Washington &quot;recoups the tens of billions of dollars and military equipment sent to Ukraine.&quot; During a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House, Trump said he may soon meet President Volodymyr Zelensky to sign the agreement.

Reclaiming occupied territories possible but 'not easy' for Ukraine, Trump claims	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 24 that he believes Ukraine might be able to reclaim some of its territories occupied by Russia, but it would be challenging. He stated this in response to journalists during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, which took place at the White House. &quot;You&#x2019;re asking whether or not they (Ukrainians) could take back the land that they lost. And I say that yes, perhaps some of it, yes. But that&#x2019;s not an easy thing to do,&#x201D; Trump said. He also noted that this question is part of the current negotiations that have recently started. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll see,&#x201D; Trump said. &#x201C;There has been a lot of land that has been taken, so we will have to see how it works out. It&#x2019;s part of the negotiation.&#x201D; The U.S. held the first round of talks directly with Russia on Feb. 18, excluding Ukraine from the meeting. The decision sparked a backlash in Europe and Ukraine, with European leaders worried they were being sidelined by the U.S. Macron has recently rallied European counterparts to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to visit Washington later this week to meet with Trump.	https://kyivindependent.com/reclaiming-occupied-territories-possible-but-not-easy-for-ukraine-trump-claims/	2025-02-24T20:21:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198721894.jpg
Russia's Ryazan oil refinery halts operations following drone strike, Reuters reports	Russia&#x2019;s Ryazan oil refinery suspended operations after a Ukrainian drone attack set its main crude distillation unit, CDU-6, on fire, Reuters reported on Feb. 24. The refinery, owned by Rosneft, halted oil processing entirely, multiple industry sources told Reuters. However, it may partially resume operations within days by using CDU-4 and CDU-3 units, while CDU-6 is repaired. The attack caused at least five explosions, with local authorities attributing the fire to falling drone debris. This refinery had only recently resumed activity on Feb. 11 following an 18-day shutdown after a previous attack. This is the third time since the beginning of 2025 that drones have attacked the Ryazan Oil Refinery, according to the independent Telegram channel Astra. The Ryazan Oil Refinery is one of Russia&apos;s five largest oil refining facilities, according to Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation. Its capacity is 17.1 million metric tons of oil per year. Kovalenko added that the fuel produced at the enterprise is used by the Russian army&apos;s strategic long-range aviation, which launches missile strikes against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-ryazan-oil-refinery-halts-operations-following-drone-strike-reuters-reports/	2025-02-24T18:41:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1245921994.jpg

Peace must not mean a surrender of Ukraine,' Macron says following Trump visit	French President Emmanuel Macron reaffirmed his commitment to Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty on the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine in a joint press conference with U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 24. &quot;I&apos;m going to tell him (Trump) &apos;You can&apos;t be weak with (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin,&apos;&quot; Macron said on Feb. 20 in the lead-up to his meeting with Trump. Europe has scrambled to strengthen support for Ukraine in response to uncertainty in U.S. foreign policy. Macron praised Trump for working on a minerals deal with President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the deal is a commitment to Ukrainian sovereignty. The minerals deal is an agreement in the works that would grant the U.S. preferential access to rare earth minerals among other resources such as oil in Ukraine. The deal could reportedly grant the U.S. $500 billion in value stemming from 50% of revenue from resource extraction in Ukraine, but has garnered criticism from many for being a &quot;colonial agreement.&quot; &quot;This peace must not mean a surrender of Ukraine. It must not mean a ceasefire without guarantees. This peace must allow for Ukrainian sovereignty and allow Ukraine to negotiate with other stakeholders,&quot; Macron said. Macron said he and Trump both share the view that a lasting peace must be established swiftly in Ukraine. The French leader stressed the need to ensure a peace agreement is not weak in response to Trump&apos;s calls for a swift peace settlement that many fear would favor Russia. Trump and Macron agreed on the importance of having European peacekeepers deployed to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. &quot;That is one of the great areas of progress that we&#x2019;ve made during this trip and during this discussion,&quot; Macron said referring to the deployment of peacekeepers to Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to visit Trump in a similar meeting on Feb. 27.	https://kyivindependent.com/peace-must-not-mean-a-surrender-of-ukraine-macron-says-following-trump-visit/	2025-02-24T16:15:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1258320110.jpg
Ukraine, Russia reach a deal to evacuate Kursk Oblast residents, Russian official claims	Ukraine and Russia have agreed to evacuate residents of Kursk Oblast through Belarus to other regions of the country, a Russian official claimed on Feb. 24. &quot;There are people who are already in Sumy (Oblast) today. And there is an agreement with the Red Cross and the Ukrainian side that they will be evacuated through Belarus to Russia,&quot; Russian rights commissioner Tatyana Moskalkova said on Feb. 24. It is unclear how many people would be relocated under this agreement. Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024 and still holds significant territory in the region. Many believe Ukraine&#x2019;s control of Kursk Oblast could be a bargaining chip in potential peace negotiations with Russia. Russian media has been reporting allegations that Ukrainian troops shot civilians, &quot;including women, children and the elderly, both in their own homes and while attempting to evacuate them in civilian vehicles&quot; in the areas where Ukrainian forces have been operating. Ukraine&#x2019;s Center for Countering Disinformation has dismissed these claims as disinformation, adding that Russia has been working to create a narrative of Ukrainian atrocities. &quot;The Kremlin has been pumping in lots of money to create a &apos;Russian Bucha&apos; (hundreds of civilians were massacred by Russian troops in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha during Russian occupation of the area in spring 2022) &#xA0;in the information space by any means necessary, spreading fakes about the alleged &apos;terrible crimes&apos; of Ukrainians on the territory of the Russian Federation for several months now,&quot; the center said in late January. Russian authorities routinely appeal to the international community and accuse Ukraine of committing atrocities, while simultaneously block the International Red Cross (IRC) representatives from accessing the sites of these alleged crimes. Instead, they rely on the complicity of the Russian Red Cross office, whose neutrality and impartiality remains questionable. Unlike these propaganda narratives, Russian war crimes have been documented by international organizations. The U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has recorded 79 executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war by Russian forces since August 2024. Russian officials claim 500 people are missing in Kursk Oblast, but many locals believe the true number is closer to 3,000. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has been pushing for Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine to be resolved swiftly. The first step came on Feb. 18 when Russian and U.S. officials met in Saudi Arabia for preliminary talks without Ukraine. Trump has previously promised to end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours. Since his victory in the U.S. presidential election, that timeline has been revised. The U.S administration has reportedly told European officials that it hopes to achieve a ceasefire agreement by Easter, which falls on April 20.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-and-russia-reached-a-deal-to-evacuate-kursk-oblast-residents-russian-official-claims/	2025-02-24T14:57:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/Red-Cross.jpeg
Trump refuses to label Putin a dictator	U.S. President Donald Trump chose not to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a dictator, responding to journalists on the sidelines of a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron on Feb. 24. &quot;I don&apos;t use those words lightly... I think we&apos;re going to see how it all works out,&quot; Trump said on Feb. 24 when asked if he would call Putin a dictator the same way he labeled President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 19. Trump called Ukrainian leader a &quot;dictator&quot; in a post on his social media platform Truth Social, accusing him of refusing to hold elections, and repeating false claims about the war in Ukraine. Trump&apos;s remarks disregard Ukraine&apos;s constitution which prohibits elections under martial law and echoed the narratives of Russian propaganda. Trump will meet with Zelensky within the next two weeks to finalize a minerals deal. Ukraine and the U.S. have been working out the terms of such a deal for weeks. Trump said in early February that he wanted to strike a deal with Ukraine involving access to rare earth minerals in exchange for continued aid. Trump later claimed that Kyiv has &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a $500 billion resource deal. A former Ukrainian official described the initial deal as &quot;a colonial agreement.&quot; Following Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to meet Trump on Feb. 27.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-refuses-to-label-putin-a-dictator/	2025-02-24T13:54:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200644008.jpg
Nobody can demand anything from Russia' — Putin talks about renewed US-Russia contacts, rare earth metals	Russian President Vladimir Putin met with officials on Feb. 24 to discuss rare earth metals production, calling it a strategic reserve crucial for Russia&apos;s economic growth and global competitiveness. He emphasized the importance of the newly launched national project, &quot;New Materials and Chemistry,&quot; which aims to strengthen the domestic industry. The initiative seeks to develop a full-cycle rare and rare-earth metals sector, from extraction to high-tech manufacturing, with a significant increase in production. In an interview with Russian propagandist Pavel Zarubin published on Feb. 24, Putin followed up on the minerals topic, adding that any potential agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine over natural resources would not affect Russia. He pointed out that Russia has significantly larger reserves of rare earth metals than Ukraine is open to working with foreign partners in developing rare earth deposits, including in the occupied parts of Ukraine which Putin called &quot;newly controlled regions.&quot; Putin also suggested that U.S. President Donald Trump has greater freedom in handling Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine than European leaders. &quot;He doesn&#x2019;t just say what he thinks&#x2014;he does what he wants. That is the privilege of the leader of a great power,&quot; Kremlin leader said. While Russia and the U.S. must restore mutual trust, he added that no substantial talks with Trump on Ukraine had taken place. Putin also claimed that President Volodymyr Zelensky has become a &quot;toxic figure for Ukraine&#x2019;s armed forces who &quot;blocks peace efforts and weakens his country.&quot; He blamed Zelensky&#x2019;s &quot;absurd orders&quot; for the military&apos;s &quot;catastrophic losses&quot; and accused the Ukrainian president of avoiding negotiations to delay elections. Putin went on to dismiss Europe&apos;s concerns over U.S.-Russia talks. &quot;Nobody can demand anything from Russia, especially not Europe. Let them make demands of someone else. For centuries, they have been making demands of their vassals&#x2014;now their own people are making demands of them. They should sit at home and think about how they ended up in this situation,&quot; he said. Putin also welcomed Trump&#x2019;s proposal to cut defense spending, suggesting that Russia and the U.S. could agree to a 50% reduction.	https://kyivindependent.com/nobody-can-demand-anything-from-russia-putin-talks-about-renewed-us-russia-contacts-rare-earth-metals/	2025-02-24T13:30:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164023634.jpg
Ukraine war latest: War in Ukraine could end 'within weeks,' Putin open to peacekeepers, Trump claims	Key developments on Feb. 24: U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 24 that Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine could end &quot;within weeks&quot; and claimed Russian President Vladimir Putin would allow European peacekeepers to be stationed in Ukraine as part of a potential agreement. &quot;I think we could end it within weeks. If we&apos;re smart. If we&apos;re not smart, it&apos;ll keep going, and we&apos;ll keep losing young, beautiful people that shouldn&apos;t be dying,&quot; he said, speaking alongside French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House. Trump claimed the U.S. supported sending European troops to monitor a ceasefire and that he had discussed the proposal with Putin, who &quot;would accept it.&quot; When asked whether Ukraine should be willing to cede territory to Russia as part of a negotiated settlement, Trump responded, &quot;We&apos;ll see,&quot; noting that talks are still in the early stages. Macron said Europe is prepared to provide security guarantees to Ukraine, including peacekeepers, in case of a ceasefire. American and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 without Ukrainian or European participation, with a follow-up meeting scheduled for Feb. 25. Macron has recently rallied European counterparts to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to visit Washington later this week to meet with Trump. The U.K. is reportedly preparing to propose a plan to deploy 30,000 European peacekeepers to Ukraine as a post-ceasefire security guarantee. Macron has also led calls for a European-led mission to ensure stability in Ukraine. Trump has repeatedly said he wants Europe to take over responsibility for funding and overseeing Ukraine&apos;s security. His administration has also pressured Kyiv to sign a minerals deal with the U.S., which President Volodymyr Zelensky has criticized for offering no security guarantees in return. The UN General Assembly approved a Ukrainian resolution on Feb. 24 condemning Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, with 93 countries voting in favor and 18 against. The U.S., Israel, Hungary, Russia, and Belarus have voted against the resolution. The resolution, drafted by Kyiv and supported by all EU states except Hungary, reaffirms Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity. It explicitly names Russia as the aggressor. On the same day, the General Assembly passed a separate U.S. resolution marking the third anniversary of the invasion. That resolution also received 93 votes in favor but avoided directly calling Russia the aggressor. Ukraine abstained from voting on the U.S. version. According to Suspilne, Washington sent letters to UN member states urging them to support its resolution. The move aligns with recent U.S. efforts to soften language on Russia in international statements. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz both declined to explicitly name Russia as the aggressor in Fox News interviews. Hegseth referred to the war as &quot;a very complicated situation&quot; when asked if Russia attacked Ukraine unprovoked. U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia while adopting increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Kyiv. He recently called President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and falsely claimed Ukraine started the war &#x2014; before later conceding that &quot;Russia attacked, but they shouldn&#x2019;t have let him attack.&quot; The shift in U.S. language extends beyond the UN. The Financial Times reported that the U.S. opposed referring to Russia as the aggressor in a G7 statement commemorating the invasion&apos;s anniversary. European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen arrived in Kyiv on Feb. 24 on the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. European leaders and other partners are arriving in Kyiv for a summit to discuss the country&apos;s strategy for possible negotiations and security guarantees. The meeting is taking place amid uncertainty about the U.S.&apos;s continued commitment to Ukraine&apos;s and Europe&apos;s security under President Donald Trump. &quot;We are in Kyiv today, because Ukraine is Europe,&quot; von der Leyen said on X. &quot;In this fight for survival, it is not only the destiny of Ukraine that is at stake. It&#x2019;s Europe&#x2019;s destiny.&quot; 0:00/1&#xD7;European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen arrived in Kyiv on Feb. 24, 2025, on the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. (Ursula von der Leyen/X)Thirteen leaders are expected to join the summit in person, and 24 would join the event online, President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed at a press conference on Feb. 23. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, and Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal arrived soon after Costa and von der Leyen. Other leaders, including Finnish President Alexander Stubb, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere, Icelandic Prime Minister, Kristrun Frostadottir, and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson are also in the capital, Suspilne reported. Boris Johnson, the former U.K. prime minister, also announced his arrival. &quot;I am proud to be here in Kyiv on the third anniversary of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&#x2019;s invasion. I salute the continuing heroism of the Ukrainian people in resisting a vile act of unprovoked aggression and I categorically reject the bizarre untruths currently being peddled about the origins of that war,&quot; Johnson said on X. Around 165,000 Russian troops have been killed since the launch of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to a report by Meduza and Mediazona, independent Russian media outlets, on Feb. 24. Using open-source research and statistical analysis, the report suggests that Russian losses have increased each year. In 2022, approximately 20,000 Russian soldiers were killed. That number more than doubled in 2023, reaching between 47,000 and 53,000, and surged to nearly 100,000 in 2024. The assessment does not account for foreign fighters or conscripts from occupied Ukrainian territories, whom Russia forcibly recruits to replenish its forces. The estimate is based on comparing roll call lists of the deceased with Russia&apos;s Register of Inheritance Cases. Russia&apos;s total losses &#x2014; including killed, wounded, missing, and captured personnel &#x2014; are significantly higher, with Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 24 of 868,230 such cases. President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on Feb. 15 that Moscow had lost around 250,000 soldiers, with 20,000 killed in battles for Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast alone. Over 610,000 Russian troops have been wounded since the invasion began, according to Zelensky. Kyiv launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk in August 2024, initially seizing about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. Up to 12,000 North Korean soldiers were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces after they failed to push out Ukrainian troops. The rising casualties have fueled a surge in missing persons cases in Russia, with courts handling 20,000 such claims in 2024 &#x2014; two-and-a-half times the pre-war annual average, Mediazona reported on Feb. 4. Drones operated by Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces struck an oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Ryazan Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 24. Kyiv considers oil refineries to be valid military targets, as profits from the fossil fuel industry fund Russia&apos;s war machine. This is the third time since the beginning of 2025 that drones have attacked the Ryazan Oil Refinery, according to the independent Telegram channel Astra. The Ryazan Oil Refining Company&apos;s facility was previously struck overnight on Jan. 24 and Jan. 26. At least five explosions were heard near the facility. According to preliminary data from the General Staff, the attack caused a fire near the primary oil processing facility. The full consequences of the attack are still being determined, according to the statement. Ryazan Oblast Governor Pavel Malkov confirmed that falling drone debris had caused a fire at &quot;one of the enterprises&quot; in the region. According to Malkov, no one was injured. Ryazan lies almost 500 kilometers (310 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border. The Ryazan Oil Refinery is one of Russia&apos;s five largest oil refining facilities, according to Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation. Its capacity is 17.1 million metric tons of oil per year. Kovalenko added that the fuel produced at the enterprise is used by the Russian army&apos;s strategic long-range aviation, which launches missile strikes against Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The Ryazan Oil Refinery previously suspended operations due to damage from Ukrainian drone attacks, Reuters reported on Jan. 27, citing two industry sources. Ukraine confirmed hitting the plant in an overnight drone strike on Jan. 24. Russia will agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine only once negotiations provide a &quot;sustainable result&quot; that &quot;suits&quot; the Russian leadership, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Feb. 24, Russian state-controlled news agency RIA Novosti reported. Lavrov&apos;s comments come as the White House said a peace deal with Russia could be hashed out this week. U.S. President Donald Trump has intensified diplomatic outreach to Russia, announcing a second round of talks in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 25. &quot;The president (Vladimir Putin) has clearly said that we are ready to negotiate with Ukraine, with Europe, and with any representatives who, in a spirit of goodwill, would like to help achieve peace,&quot; Lavrov claimed. &quot;But we will cease hostilities only when these negotiations produce a firm, sustainable result that suits the Russian Federation. Of course, the realities on the ground must be considered,&quot; Lavrov added. Lavrov added that consultations with U.S. officials on the reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and the Russian Embassy in Washington are scheduled for this week. Preparations are also underway for a meeting between Trump and Putin, Russia&apos;s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Feb. 22. Trump previously said he would &quot;probably&quot; meet Putin before the end of February. The U.S. held the first round of talks directly with Russia on Feb. 18, excluding Ukraine from the meeting. The decision sparked a backlash in Europe and Ukraine, with European leaders worried they were being sidelined by the U.S. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 24 he had provided U.S. President Donald Trump with a list of all ceasefires violated by Russia, warning against a quick peace deal without clear security guarantees. &quot;Peace cannot be concluded in an hour, a day, today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow,&quot; Zelensky said in an address to world leaders at the Support Ukraine summit in Kyiv. &quot;When General (Keith) Kellogg was in Kyiv, I handed him and the U.S. president a document with all the ceasefires, along with specific dates, that Russia had violated.&quot; According to Ukraine&apos;s president, Russia has violated 25 ceasefires since the start of its aggression in 2014. Zelensky&apos;s comments come amid growing concerns that Trump is seeking to sideline Ukraine and Europe in possible peace negotiations to cut a deal with Russia. U.S. and Russian delegates held talks in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 without Ukraine&apos;s participation, with a follow-up meeting scheduled for Feb. 25. While no specific plans for a peace deal were announced, Trump&apos;s diplomatic outreach to Moscow comes hand-in-hand with his increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Ukraine and Zelensky. The U.S. president has lambasted Zelensky as a &quot;dictator without elections,&quot; echoing Russian propaganda narratives about the latter&apos;s legitimacy. Trump&apos;s aides have also been pushing Kyiv to sign a deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, which Zelensky said provides no security guarantees in return. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly warned that a swift ceasefire deal without strong security guarantees, such as continued military support or NATO membership, would give Russia time to regain strength and resume its aggression at a later date. &quot;Therefore, peace must be based on balanced diplomacy and clear security guarantees,&quot; Zelensky said at the summit.

Despite growing Russian, US pressure, world rallies in support of Ukraine	Three years into Russia&#x2019;s all-out war, Ukraine is under increasing pressure from Russia on the battlefield and the U.S. in high cabinets. Russian troops have been gaining ground around Pokrovsk in Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk Oblast, while U.S. President Donald Trump has made increasingly hostile comments against President Volodymyr Zelensky in an attempt to force Ukraine to sign a deal that it doesn&#x2019;t want. But in these fights, Ukraine doesn&#x2019;t stand alone. On the days nearing the third anniversary, thousands of people around the world have taken to the streets their desire to show support for Ukraine and its fight for freedom. Ukrainian World Congress (UWC) told Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty on Feb. 24 that the demonstrations have been held in 78 countries, covering over 600 cities. Demonstrations were held in the EU, the U.S., Canada, as well as South Africa, Uruguay, Vietnam, Guatemala, Peru, Jordan, Indonesia, and Japan.	https://kyivindependent.com/the-world-rallies-in-support-of-ukraine/	2025-02-24T12:55:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200947529.jpg
War in Ukraine could end 'within weeks,' Putin open to peacekeepers, Trump claims	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 24 that Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine could end &quot;within weeks&quot; and claimed Russian President Vladimir Putin would allow European peacekeepers to be stationed in Ukraine as part of a potential agreement. &quot;I think we could end it within weeks. If we&apos;re smart. If we&apos;re not smart, it&apos;ll keep going, and we&apos;ll keep losing young, beautiful people that shouldn&apos;t be dying,&quot; he said, speaking alongside French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House.

Trump says Ukraine minerals deal to 'be signed very soon,' plans meeting Zelensky	U.S. President Donald Trump said in a Feb. 24 Truth Social post that he hopes the minerals deal with Ukraine &quot;will be signed very soon.&quot; Trump reiterated his push for a deal between the U.S. and Ukraine, arguing that it would help Kyiv&apos;s economy while ensuring that Washington &quot;recoups the tens of billions of dollars and military equipment sent to Ukraine.&quot; During a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House, Trump said he may soon meet President Volodymyr Zelensky to sign the agreement. He added that he expects Zelensky to visit Washington &quot;this week or next week.&quot; Trump&apos;s comments came after a virtual Group of Seven (G7) summit marking the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Zelensky spoke with Trump during the meeting and described their conversation as &quot;very good.&quot; A draft of the agreement, obtained by the New York Times, reportedly seeks 50% of revenues from Ukraine&apos;s natural resources without offering security commitments in return. Trump also claimed he was in &quot;serious discussions&quot; with Russian President Vladimir Putin on &quot;ending the war&quot; and on &quot;major economic development transactions between the United States and Russia.&quot; He added that &quot;talks are proceeding very well&quot; without providing further details. U.S. and Russian officials held talks in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 without Ukrainian participation, with a follow-up meeting scheduled for Feb. 25.

How Ukraine has pushed back and held the line against Russia for 3 years	Elon Musk on Feb. 21 questioned why Ukraine was still actively defending itself amid the ongoing Russian full-scale invasion, suggesting the country&apos;s fight against the Kremlin&apos;s imperialist ambitions was, in fact, a giant money-making scam. &quot;What are they dying for? What exactly are they dying for? The line of engagement has barely moved for two years. People are dead in trenches, and for what?&quot; Musk said at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). Without providing evidence and repeating unfounded claims, he added: &quot;I&apos;ll tell you what for, for the biggest graft machine I&apos;ve ever seen in my life.&quot; Three years ago, on Feb. 24, 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion against Ukraine in an attempt to wipe out the country and its people. Moscow&apos;s brutal invasion killed tens of thousands of Ukrainians, who have died defending their country&apos;s right to exist as a sovereign and democratic nation. On April 7, 2022, as Russia was pushed out of Kyiv&apos;s outskirts, Pentagon spokesperson Major General Pat Ryder said Russian President Vladimir Putin had &quot;achieved exactly zero of his objectives inside Ukraine.&quot; &quot;He didn&apos;t take Kyiv. He didn&apos;t topple the government. He didn&apos;t remove Ukraine as a nation state,&quot; he added. Three years on and this statement still holds true. In fact, Russia occupies less Ukrainian territory than it did when Ryder spoke. Before the start of the full-scale invasion, Russia occupied 7.1 percent of Ukrainian territory, according to U.S. intelligence assessments, consisting of the whole Crimean peninsula and around one-third of both Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts. According to data from Ukrainian data journalism website Texty, the peak of Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine was in March 2022. On the 31st of that month, Moscow&apos;s forces controlled 167,223 square kilometers of Ukraine, just under 28% of the country&apos;s total land mass of 603,628 square kilometers. A comparison of occupied Ukrainian territory &#x2014; at its peak in March 2022 vs. February 2025 (Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)Due to the fast moving nature of Russian advances in February 2022, there is no reliable data for how much land Moscow&apos;s forces fully controlled in the first few days of the full-scale invasion. Russia had advanced in the north, south, and east of Ukraine, with the northern push aiming to take the capital of Kyiv. Due to fierce Ukrainian resistance, this advance quickly stalled, and Russia was forced into a humiliating retreat at the beginning of April 2022, giving up around 40% of the land taken since Feb. 24, and exposing the myth of Russia&apos;s military superpower status. Moscow&apos;s initial advances in the south and east saw large parts of Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Kharkiv, and Luhansk oblasts fall under Russian control. But lightning Ukrainian counteroffensives launched in late summer 2022, saw Kyiv retake control of great swathes of land including the cities of Kherson. Russia illegally annexed Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts on Sept. 30, 2022, despite controlling none of the regions in full. At the beginning of 2023, Russia occupied 108,928 sq kilometers, or just over 18.04% of Ukrainian territory, according to the DeepState monitoring group. A long-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive launched in June 2023 stalled, and since then, the war in Ukraine has settled largely into one of attrition as Kyiv holds the line against Moscow&apos;s forces. Russian losses vs. Ukrainian land occupied. (The Kyiv Independent)One notable exception was Ukraine&apos;s surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. According to Russian General Staff officer Sergei Rudsky, Ukrainian soldiers are in control of about 500 square kilometers (193 square miles) out of 1,268 square kilometers (490 square miles) initially seized by Kyiv. As of Feb. 23, 2025, Russia occupies 112,333 sq kilometers, 18.61% of Ukrainian territory, with the small gains made in grinding advances in eastern Ukraine, taken at huge cost. According to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, Russia has lost 868,230 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. They are broadly in line with estimates from Western nations. Around 165,000 Russian troops have been killed since the launch of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to a report by Meduza and Mediazona, independent Russian media outlets, on Feb. 24. Russia&apos;s rate of advance has slowed over the last three months, and according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), at this speed, it would take Russia more than 83 years to capture the rest of Ukraine. &quot;Assuming that they can sustain massive personnel losses indefinitely,&quot; it added. Three years of war have also cost Ukraine dearly &#x2014; more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, and 380,000 have been injured, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with NBC published on Feb. 16.	https://kyivindependent.com/how-ukraine-has-pushed-back-and-held-the-line-against-russia-for-3-years/	2025-02-24T09:47:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2192693446.jpg
EU imports of Russian fossil fuels exceeded aid to Ukraine in third year of the Russian invasion, report says	The EU paid 21.9 billion euros ($22.9 billion) for Russian fossil fuel imports in the third year of Moscow&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, just a 1% year-on-year drop in volumes, according to a new report by the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) published on Feb. 24. The total of Russian imports exceeds the 18.7 billion euros ($19.6 billion) in financial aid that Europe sent to Ukraine in 2024, said the report, published on the third anniversary of the full-scale invasion. While Europe began reducing its dependence on Russian energy after Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Gazprom gradually cut flows to the EU to pressure Ukraine&apos;s allies, the EU has continued to fuel the Kremlin&#x2019;s war chest with imports of Russian fossil fuels. &quot;Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Europe has made significant progress in terms of energy independence. Imports of Russian oil and gas have decreased substantially, with gas imports dropping from 45% in 2021 to 18% in 2024,&#x201D; said Thomas Pellerin-Carlin, EU Parliament member, in a comment for the report. &#x201C;However, a quarter of Russia&apos;s fossil fuel export revenues still come from Europe.&quot; Despite reduction efforts, EU member states spent 7 billion euros ($7.3 billion) on Russian natural gas in the third year of the full-scale invasion, with volumes rising 9% compared to the previous year. Stronger sanctions could cut the Kremlin&apos;s fossil fuel revenues by 51 billion euros ($53.3 billion) annually, effectively reducing profits, said CREA. Russia&apos;s total global fossil fuel revenue reached 242 billion euros ($253 billion) in the third year of the full-scale invasion, mainly due to its increased use of &quot;shadow&quot; tankers to transport oil to new markets, bypassing oil price caps. &quot;Due to insufficient sanctions and loopholes, Russia has earned over 825 billion euros ($862.9 billion) from fossil fuel exports since the start of their invasion of Ukraine,&quot; said Isaac Levi, Europe-Russia Energy policy analyst of CREA. &quot;Sanctioning countries are fueling the very war that&apos;s killing their allies in Ukraine,&quot; Levi said. The European Union on Feb. 24 approved its 16th package of sanctions imposed against Russia in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, targeting Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of oil tankers, banks, aluminum imports, and other sectors. &quot;The West&#x2019;s strategic priority should be to impose sanctions on as many Russian shadow oil vessels as possible,&quot; said Petras Katinas, energy analyst at CREA. &quot;Targeting these ships would not only curtail Moscow&#x2019;s revenue from a key export but also strengthen leverage to enforce or adjust the price cap mechanism.&quot; EU members Slovakia, Hungary, and Czechia continue exploiting exemptions, importing 4.9 billion euros ($5.1 billion) of Russian pipeline oil in the third year. &quot;This isn&apos;t about technical constraints, but about putting profits from discounted Russian crude ahead of European security,&quot; said CREA analyst Luke Wickenden. Three countries now dominate Russian fossil fuel purchases: China (78 billion euros or $81.6 billion), India (49 billion euros or $51.3 billion), and Turkey (34 billion euros or $35.6 billion), accounting for 74% of Russia&apos;s fossil fuel revenues.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-imports-of-russian-fuels-exceed-financial-aid-to-ukraine-in-third-year-of-the-russian-invasion-report-says/	2025-02-24T09:25:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2159134814.jpg
Trump’s Ukraine rare earths deal: 'The art of the steal'	Among the bombshells coming out of the Trump administration in its first month in office is the president&#x2019;s demand that Ukraine pledge $500 billion worth of mineral resources to the United States in return for American support. U.S. President Donald Trump appears to see this as payback for vastly exaggerated sums of American military and financial assistance provided to Ukraine since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion three years ago. As always, the devil is in the details when assessing how such a deal might work. It is true that the Ukrainian government, as the sovereign owner of mineral rights, can sign agreements for development consistent with Ukrainian laws and the constitution. However, the U.S. government, which is the counterparty to the draft memorandum proposed by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Kyiv on Feb. 12, does not invest directly in mining projects &#x2014; especially those overseas. Presumably, Trump envisions the American private sector extracting Ukrainian resources included in the memorandum. Investors in mineral, oil, and gas development (a field I worked in for decades) must conduct detailed geological surveys, assay the quality of the ore or source rocks, carry out pilot projects and feasibility studies, and perform other due diligence to determine whether any project is commercially viable. Normally, it takes five to 10 years, including regulatory approvals, to reach a final investment decision and secure financing. It is difficult to estimate how long this would take in a war-torn country whose territorial integrity is under attack. If conceding to demands on critical minerals is a condition for security support, then America is no different from Russia&#x2019;s Wagner Group of mercenaries. The whole concept is a mirage &#x2014; or worse, a head fake. It is reminiscent of what Trump said in 2019 during his first term about why he was keeping American troops in Syria: &#x201C;I like oil, we&#x2019;re keeping the oil.&#x201D; Observers were left wondering how he planned to seize Syria&#x2019;s oil production, which in any case was not significant. Of course, nothing came of it. Now, Trump is fixated on Ukraine&#x2019;s rare earths. The total value of rare earths produced globally is estimated at $15 billion a year. It is hard to imagine how $500 billion in value could be extracted from Ukrainian rare earths. Perhaps Trump is confusing rare earths with critical minerals, such as titanium, base metals, and oil and gas, which may be included in the draft memorandum. These resources require larger-scale, long-term investments, and restoring peace and stability is a prerequisite. In 2010, the Pentagon estimated Afghanistan had $1 trillion in mineral deposits. Another decade of American presence in Afghanistan did not lead to their development. A memorandum granting rights to speculative Ukrainian minerals is just as worthless.

(Evgeniy Maloletka/Bloomberg via Getty Images)The U.S. has more important national interests in Ukraine than extracting economic benefits from transactions that are impossible to execute. Does the Trump administration understand this &#x2014; or is it setting up Ukraine for abandonment under the pretext that Kyiv is unwilling to accept Washington&#x2019;s new terms for continued support? That such basic questions can be asked after Russia&#x2019;s initial invasion in 2014 reflects Washington&#x2019;s policy confusion about why assisting Ukraine defends core American interests. This is a bipartisan failure, as demonstrated by President Joe Biden&#x2019;s timid and incremental military support for Ukraine and weak sanctions against Russia. Ironically, Biden left Trump with a stronger hand by finally enacting tougher sanctions on Jan. 10 before leaving office. Trump could use strict sanctions enforcement as leverage on Russia to reach a just settlement acceptable to Ukraine. Instead of pressuring the victim, he should pressure the aggressor. Given the sorry state of Russia&#x2019;s military and economy, Putin is desperate to declare victory and pocket any gains handed to him. If this were a game of poker, Putin would be bluffing with a weak hand &#x2014; while Trump is poised to fold without even looking at his own stronger hand. The danger to Ukraine is obvious, but the risks to America&#x2019;s global standing are just as great. If America betrays both its principles and its own interests in Ukraine, every nation will have to recalibrate its relationship with the U.S. Allies and partners would reevaluate the value of American commitments to them, while adversaries would be emboldened to test America&#x2019;s resolve. Putin overreached after America&#x2019;s abrupt and chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the world became a more dangerous place. Losing in Europe would turn the idea of America refocusing on the Asia-Pacific into a sick joke.

Zelensky, Trump have 'good' conversation during G7 meeting	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump during the G7 meeting held online on Feb. 24. &quot;As for Donald Trump... We have just had a conversation. It was a very good conversation within the framework of the G7 meeting led by Canada,&quot; Zelensky said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, together with around a dozen European leaders and top officials, have visited Kyiv on Feb. 24, marking three years since the start of Russia&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-trump-have-good-conversation-on-g7-meeting-sidelines/	2025-02-24T08:46:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/photo_2024-01-29_14-15-42.jpg
In 3 years of war, Ukraine's mothers have been forced underground	As Ukraine reaches the three-year mark since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, the impact on women&#x2019;s health &#x2014; and especially maternal health &#x2014; has grown increasingly dire. Missiles and drone attacks strike without warning, putting pregnant women and their newborns at constant risk. In areas closer to the front line, the challenges are even greater, with higher rates of premature births, a lack of consistent medical services, and overwhelming mental stress that reverberates through every aspect of daily life. I recently learned of Ira, a 31-year-old mother already raising a six-year-old boy when she discovered she was pregnant with triplets. Living in Kherson Oblast, a region routinely targeted by nighttime assaults, she and her husband faced a terrifying dilemma: endure the pregnancy amid constant shelling or uproot their entire lives. Ultimately, Ira gave birth prematurely. Though her babies initially required intensive care, they recovered and were able to leave the hospital. Her relief at their safe arrival mirrored the resolve of countless Ukrainian mothers who persist in bringing new life into the world despite difficult odds. Yet Ira&#x2019;s story is part of a broader crisis. Maternal health is consistently threatened by damaged hospitals, infrastructure, staff shortages, and the simple but devastating reality that an air raid can happen at any moment &#x2014; interrupting childbirth or prenatal care. According to 2023 data, the national rate of preterm births is around 6%, but in hard-hit regions such as Kherson Oblast, that rate rises to 11.8% &#x2014; nearly double the national average. Kherson also has the highest stillbirth rate in Ukraine. Doctors working in these conditions consistently link high stress levels to the uptick in adverse outcomes. Because of the environment, there is a need for bunkered maternity wards in areas close to the front lines. Facilities in Kharkiv and Kherson are setting up reinforced underground units designed to protect women in labor from shelling. These structures, supported by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the organization&#x2019;s sexual and reproductive health agency, allow full perinatal services to continue even during attacks, relieving pregnant women of the need to relocate in the middle of childbirth. A woman sits in a bomb shelter after a maternity ward moved underground for safety in Kharkiv, Ukraine, on March 25, 2022. (Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times)The Kherson City Perinatal Centre, for example, has been hit by shelling three times since the invasion began &#x2014; an unsettling reminder that medical facilities are still not safe. By creating safer underground spaces, staff and patients can focus on care rather than constant evacuation plans. Medical teams in these vulnerable areas are brave. Some, like the staff at Kherson&#x2019;s maternity hospital, have chosen not to leave despite the dangers. They know their departure could mean an absence of care for expectant mothers who decide to stay in their hometowns. As one obstetrician noted, many pregnant women refuse offers to relocate because they would rather remain in familiar surroundings and trust local doctors. There is a shared commitment to preserving a sense of normalcy &#x2014; even when bombs continue to fall. Unfortunately, the war does more than threaten physical safety. Psychological distress has become widespread. According to the UN&#x2019;s humanitarian coordination office, 63% of households in Ukraine report at least one mental health challenge &#x2014; ranging from anxiety to severe depression. Constant shelling, economic hardship, and the fear of future attacks compound these issues. For pregnant women, the added stress can increase the risk of complications and postpartum disorders. Such an environment also increases the prevalence of gender-based violence (GBV). Economic uncertainty and relentless fear fuel intimate partner violence, domestic abuse, and sexual exploitation. An estimated 2.4 million people in Ukraine &#x2014; most of them women and girls &#x2014; need GBV prevention and response services. UNFPA supports these interventions, however, while the war continues, international actors, community-based organizations, and health providers struggle to meet the rising demand. We know that safeguarding women&#x2019;s health is essential for any nation&#x2019;s future. Ensuring safe births today means ensuring a resilient generation tomorrow. By constructing bomb-proof maternity wards, delivering comprehensive healthcare, and expanding mental health and GBV services, Ukraine can mitigate some of the conflict&#x2019;s harshest effects. Yet none of these measures can fully substitute for the one factor that truly guarantees the well-being of mothers and newborns: lasting peace. Peace is the foundation on which we can work toward justice. Until it is achieved, we have a duty to support the well-being of women and families &#x2014; on the surface and underground.

Women account for 21% of applicants at Ukraine's army recruitment centers	Women make up 21% of applicants at Ukraine&apos;s army recruitment centers, the Defense Ministry said on Feb. 24. Since the centers began operations, 42,366 Ukrainians have applied, with the highest number of female candidates coming from western Chernivtsi, Khmelnytskyi, and Ternopil oblasts. Among all applicants, the most sought-after positions include drone operators, drivers, and shooting specialities. Ukraine currently operates 48 recruitment centers, including one online platform, to guide and support potential recruits. While Kyiv passed a major draft reform bill in April, mobilization slowed in the fall, leaving front-line units depleted. Russian forces have maintained an overwhelming numerical advantage, allowing them to advance in eastern Ukraine despite sustaining heavy casualties. Despite their persistent offensives, Russian forces have not achieved a major breakthrough, while Ukrainian defenses remain under constant pressure across multiple front-line sectors. Ukraine&apos;s government approved a one-year contract for volunteers aged 18-24 on Feb. 11, aiming to boost recruitment with financial incentives and social benefits.	https://kyivindependent.com/women-account-for-21-of-applicants-at-ukraines-army-recruitment-centers-defense-ministry-reports/	2025-02-24T08:40:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/valkiriya_training-17.jpg
Lithuania's Nauseda proposes 2030 as Ukraine's EU accession date	Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda proposed on Feb. 24 setting Jan. 1, 2030, as the official date for Ukraine&#x2019;s accession to the European Union. Speaking at the Support Ukraine summit in Kyiv, Nauseda called for decisive leadership to accelerate Ukraine&apos;s integration. &quot;The security of Europe depends on the security of Ukraine. That is why let us accelerate Ukraine&apos;s accession to the EU,&quot; Nauseda said. He added that the first cluster of accession talks could be opened in the coming weeks and urged European leaders to make Ukraine&apos;s path to the bloc &quot;inevitable.&quot; Ukraine applied for EU membership in 2022, shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion. The country achieved candidate status within months, and formal negotiations began in June 2024. President Volodymyr Zelensky has set an ambitious goal of opening five or six negotiation clusters in 2025, with the first phase expected under Poland&apos;s rotating EU presidency. EU Enlargement Commissioner Oliver Varhelyi previously suggested that Ukraine could join the bloc by 2029 if it successfully implements the necessary reforms. Ukraine&apos;s EU accession process is structured around six negotiation clusters, covering various political and economic reforms. The country aims to open at least two or three clusters in early 2025, with additional progress expected under Denmark&apos;s EU Council presidency in the latter half of the year.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuanias-nauseda-proposes-2030-as-ukraines-eu-accession-date/	2025-02-24T07:52:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2095080149.jpg

‘It’s not the end’ — Kyiv Independent staff on what they’d tell themselves right before Russia's invasion	Feb. 24, 2025 marks three years of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Three years since Ukraine, and the world, ceased to exist as we knew them. Kyiv Independent staff members have answered the question, &quot;If you could go back in time, what would you tell yourself on the eve of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion?&quot; The following reflections offer a window into the profound impact this war has had on a group of people covering the war &#x2014; and a nation &#x2014; changed forever. I would tell myself that everything about your life will change tomorrow: your understanding of war, peace, and life. And that you made a good call convincing your parents not to return to Ukraine, where they had been living, because you had good instincts about what was to come. Don&#x2019;t freak out, but the war that is about to consume your life is way worse than you could have ever imagined. The most important thing is that you know you are not alone. You have friends and colleagues who will be there for you, so just keep taking one step at a time. You are only a 21-year-old university student who just stepped into the world of journalism. Nothing is expected of you. So just cherish the last few hours in peace, the calm before the storm before the innocence of youth is taken away from you. Make sure that you are comfortable with the risk you are taking, and follow your gut &#x2014; it can sometimes save lives. Don&#x2019;t panic, and stay true to yourself. You will lose many friends to war, you will attend funerals for the first time, and you will witness horrifying scenes that you were always scared to watch in war movies. But you are loved, and there will be beautiful moments amid the uncertainty and darkness that shine so brightly. You will discover more about yourself along the way. But also, leave the Kyiv Independent office a little earlier on Feb. 23 so that you can get a good sleep in (I left at 2 a.m. on Feb. 24 and the invasion started a few hours later).

(Roman Pilipey/Getty Images)Toma Istomina, deputy chief editor I didn&#x2019;t sleep on Feb. 24, 2022. The days leading up to the full-scale invasion were already crazy enough to keep me in the office until late at night, and by late I mean past 2 a.m. By the time I got home, it was already clear that tonight was the night when Russia would go through with its sick plan. Just 30 minutes before the first explosions rocked Kyiv and Russian tanks started rolling over Ukrainian borders from all sides, I published a post on Instagram, saying: &#x201C;Again and again we prove to have something Russia can only envy. We are united, we are courageous, and our values prevail in the face of hundreds of thousands of fully equipped troops encircling our country. We might have been unfortunate to share a border with Russia. But we are damn fortunate to have each other. And nobody will ever take that away.&#x201D; Three years later, after everything we&#x2019;ve been through, I couldn&#x2019;t say it better. If I could go back in time to the eve of the full-scale invasion, I would take my own phone, open that post, and read it out loud to myself, with a lot of confidence. No words could have truly prepared me for the horror to come, but knowing my future self stood by this vision might have made it easier to see the light ahead. Oh, and I would tell myself to call our developers and ask them to prepare our website for record traffic at 5 a.m. Waking them up after the full-scale invasion had already started to fix our crashed website? A bit awkward. A woman carries a girl past the heavily damaged Ohmatdyt Children&apos;s Hospital after a Russian missile attack in Kyiv, Ukraine, on July 8, 2024. (Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)Natalia Yermak, reporterI had a picnic on a frozen lake with my friends on the eve of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. We fried eggs and sausages over a fire. I would have told myself in that moment that my old life was about to end forever. But I will not be the only one. I&#x2019;d also tell myself that my first impression of the war &#x2014; that it is bigger than just Ukraine, and will change people&#x2019;s lives all over the world &#x2014; will prove more true than ever in a few years. There are so many stories of strength and compassion that I&#x2019;ll see over three years, and so many tragedies &#x2014; more than I ever thought I could handle. Telling these stories will help me to get through. They&#x2019;ll stay with me, and hopefully, with you, our readers, so that one day, when you or I get to have a picnic with friends, we remember the people who stood up to evil to protect the good in our lives, and we ask ourselves: What can I do to repay them?

(Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)Elsa Court, audience development managerI&#x2019;d tell myself that it&#x2019;s going to feel like the end. It&#x2019;s going to feel like there is no hope, that Ukraine will be completely occupied, that you will never see Kyiv again. You&#x2019;re also going to feel powerless watching what is happening from abroad, like seeing a tsunami or earthquake rip into a piece of land from afar. You will feel like you are standing there, frozen, as the unthinkable happens, and an unstoppable force swallows Ukraine. But just because this is how it feels, doesn&#x2019;t mean it&#x2019;s true. First of all, it&#x2019;s not the end &#x2014; it&#x2019;s only the beginning, and not just for Ukraine, but for all of Europe. You are going to see Kyiv again (in fact, you will move there two years later). And you will find working at the Kyiv Independent will make you feel like you have some impact, at least on how other non-Ukrainians like you understand Ukraine and Russia&#x2019;s war. You will also find out that Russia is not an unstoppable force &#x2014; but so far, only Ukrainians have dared to stop it. You will become a lot less fatalist after moving to Ukraine &#x2014; there&#x2019;s something about being surrounded by people who continue to live, regardless of their neighbor&#x2019;s best effort to kill them, that will change your attitude. That doesn&#x2019;t mean feelings of hopelessness will ever go away. When I feel particularly hopeless, a good Ukrainian friend tells me, &#x201C;Elsa, do kinstya&#x201D; &#x2014; Ukrainian for &quot;keep going, until the end.&quot; After three years, you still won&#x2019;t know for sure when, or where, the end will be.

(Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)Kate Tsurkan, reporter If I could go back and tell myself anything on the eve of the invasion, it would be this: prepare yourself. You know what&#x2019;s coming &#x2014; you have no doubt. But you aren&#x2019;t ready for the full extent of Russia&#x2019;s cruelty. Prepare yourself for the fact that the country you were born in won&#x2019;t help the country you love as much as it can or should. And its next president? He might betray us completely. Prepare yourself to constantly worry about your friends on the front line, and to struggle with the dual feelings of gratitude and guilt from having some semblance of a normal life thanks to them. Prepare yourself to see a video, after a Russian attack, where your friend is clearly not going to make it. It can happen again. It can happen to anyone you know &#x2014; even you. The fact that you will spend two weeks in Kharkiv without hearing a single explosion is dumb luck. Still, you should not shrug off every air raid siren like you will in Chernivtsi. You should not become so acclimated to the sounds of war. Prepare yourself &#x2014; because you will have a child. And no matter what happens, you won&#x2019;t be allowed to cry about any of this in front of her. Your job will be to teach her to cherish her culture above all else, to hate Russia for bringing war to her lands, and most importantly, to survive.

I&#x2019;d also tell myself that this war concerns the whole world; there is no justice, but you should never lose hope and always act. Back then, on the first day of Russia&#x2019;s all-out invasion, as a Ukrainian and a journalist, I was sure that the world would not just sit by and watch; it would give us all the weapons we needed, close the skies, and do everything to stop Russia from destroying my nation. But this did not happen. I would tell myself that it was in fact Ukraine &#x2014; not other countries that are richer and have more means &#x2014; that would be the most powerful and decisive in the moment, even as it seemed it was about to fall into Russia&#x2019;s hands. Will was the only weapon that Russia did not have and will never have. Ukrainian military chaplains attend their graduation at Saint Sophia&apos;s Cathedral in Kyiv, Ukraine, on June 23, 2023. (Roman Pilipey/Getty Images)Dominic Culverwell, business reporter I would tell myself to be mentally prepared for a hard and emotional three years. And to be strong because tomorrow morning, you are going to wake up and have a panic attack, but just know that your friends are going to survive the battle of Kyiv and the occupation of Bucha. You are also going to meet some of the most incredible people and make amazing friends. Ukrainians are going to teach you so much about strength and unity but be prepared for a dark shift in your humor &#x2014; it&apos;s a coping mechanism, so don&apos;t be alarmed. Ukrainians are good at cracking a joke in bleak times. I&#x2019;d tell myself that there&apos;s a long road ahead and moving to Kyiv during the war will be one of the best decisions you&apos;ve ever made. Even though the night-time drone and missile attacks are exhausting and the stories you hear are emotionally gutting, you won&apos;t ever question your decision.	https://kyivindependent.com/its-not-the-end-what-kyiv-independent-journalists-would-tell-themselves-on-the-eve-of-russias-full-scale-invasion-3-years-ago/	2025-02-24T07:33:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196727689.jpg
Around 165,000 Russian troops killed in Ukraine, media reports	Around 165,000 Russian troops have been killed since the launch of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to a report by Meduza and Mediazona, independent Russian media outlets, on Feb. 24. Using open-source research and statistical analysis, the report suggests that Russian losses have increased each year. In 2022, approximately 20,000 Russian soldiers were killed. That number more than doubled in 2023, reaching between 47,000 and 53,000, and surged to nearly 100,000 in 2024. The assessment does not account for foreign fighters or conscripts from occupied Ukrainian territories, whom Russia forcibly recruits to replenish its forces. The estimate is based on comparing roll call lists of the deceased with Russia&apos;s Register of Inheritance Cases. Russia&apos;s total losses &#x2014; including killed, wounded, missing, and captured personnel &#x2014; are significantly higher, with Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 24 of 868,230 such cases. President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on Feb. 15 that Moscow had lost around 250,000 soldiers, with 20,000 killed in battles for Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast alone. Over 610,000 Russian troops have been wounded since the invasion began, according to Zelensky. Kyiv launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk in August 2024, initially seizing about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. Up to 12,000 North Korean soldiers were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces after they failed to push out Ukrainian troops. The rising casualties have fueled a surge in missing persons cases in Russia, with courts handling 20,000 such claims in 2024 &#x2014; two-and-a-half times the pre-war annual average, Mediazona reported on Feb. 4.	https://kyivindependent.com/around-165-000-russian-troops-killed-in-ukraine-media-reports/	2025-02-24T07:03:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1242120665.jpg
Russia has launched over 30 mass strikes on Ukraine's energy system in 3 years, ministry says	Russia has launched more than 30 mass strikes on Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure over the three years of its full-scale invasion, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said on Feb. 24. &quot;Each large-scale attack on the energy sector involves 100-200, and now 3,00 different munitions that simultaneously hit power generation facilities, substations, power lines, and gas infrastructure,&quot; Halushchenko wrote on Facebook. Russia continues to target Ukrainian energy infrastructure, testing Ukraine&apos;s resolve as the country is enduring another winter. Material losses from Russian attacks have amounted to &quot;billions of dollars,&quot; according to the minister. &quot;Russia is committing crimes by attacking facilities critical to the operation of nuclear power plants, threatening to cause a nuclear disaster,&quot; Halushchenko said. Over the past three years, Russian troops have occupied territories hosting energy facilities producing 18 gigawatts (GW) of generation. The occupied facilities include hydroelectric power plants, thermal power plants, and Europe&apos;s largest nuclear power plant, stationed in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Halushchenko added. &quot;No other energy system in the world has faced such challenges. Yet, despite Russia&apos;s unbridled desire to destroy our infrastructure, the Ukrainian energy system remains intact and functioning,&quot; the minister said. The Russian military regularly attacks Ukrainian cities and villages with drones, missiles, glide bombs, and artillery. Moscow&apos;s attacks have resulted in heavy civilian casualties and destroyed hospitals, schools, kindergartens, and energy and water supply facilities. Despite the overwhelming evidence, the Russian government has denied that its army is targeting civilian targets.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-has-launched-over-30-mass-strikes-on-ukraines-energy-system-during-3-years-of-war-ministry-says/	2025-02-24T06:17:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1244055383-16661182035zpcg.jpg
When your 'ass is burning, you start to move faster' — Lithuanian minister urges Europe to step up defense	Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene urged European countries on Feb. 24 to &quot;move faster&quot; in strengthening their security in the light of recent geopolitical shifts. Speaking in the context of Russian aggression in Ukraine and Europe&apos;s need to boost its defense capabilities, Sakaliene said, &quot;When you feel that your own ass is burning, you start to move faster.&quot; &quot;So I do hope that we will start to move faster in the next few months,&quot; Lithuania&apos;s defense chief said at the YES conference event held in Kyiv by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation on Feb. 24, the third anniversary of the Russian full-scale invasion. The comments come as European leaders and other partners gather in Kyiv to devise a common strategy for Ukraine&apos;s security and pledge further assistance. The stability of the pro-Ukraine coalition grows uncertain as U.S. President Donald Trump intensifies diplomatic outreach to Moscow while sidelining Ukraine and Europe, casting doubt on his commitment to Ukrainian security. &quot;We need to strengthen our transatlantic bond. Even though we are a dysfunctional family, a divorce is not an option,&quot; Sakaliene said at the event, which was attended by the Kyiv Independent. In contrast, Lithuania&apos;s former foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, said at the conference that &quot;Europe has to understand we are in this fight most likely alone, there&#x2019;s us and Ukrainians and no one else. We pick up this battle or lose.&quot; &quot;Is Europe actually alive? If it still hasn&apos;t woken up, what&#x2019;s happening with the patient?&quot; Landsbergis said. Lithuania&apos;s former diplomacy chief urged Europe to confiscate the roughly $200 billion in frozen assets frozen in European accounts and deploy peacekeepers on the ground in Ukraine. &quot;The only question that remains is whether we ask Putin for permission. It&#x2019;s not a joke. Leaders in Europe say, &apos;We will send troops if (Russian President Vladimir) Putin allows it.&apos; This is the mentality, and we need to break it,&quot; Landsbergis said. Calls for confiscating frozen Russian assets and taking more decisive steps against Russia were also supported by businessman and oligarch Viktor Pinchuk, the host of the conference. &quot;Europe needs to completely change its understanding of this moment and do something simple but revolutionary&#x2014;use $300 billion frozen Russian assets for Ukraine, increase the military budget at least to 3%, spend much more money on supporting Ukraine and your own defense, send soldiers to Ukraine, and take Ukraine into the EU now, not later,&quot; Pinchuk said at the event. &quot;This is the right response to this moment. You are not just witnesses to this moment; you are participants.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/when-your-ass-is-burning-you-start-to-move-faster-lithuanian-minister-urges-europe-to-move-faster-on-defense/	2025-02-24T05:53:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2189744856.jpg
US reportedly urges UN to back its Ukraine resolution not naming Russia as aggressor	The U.S. sent a letter to U.N. member states asking them to vote for the American version of a resolution marking the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine that does not name Moscow as the aggressor, Suspilne reported on Feb. 24, citing an obtained text of the letter. According to the letter, Washington calls for a vote against &quot;any other option or amendments presented during the 11th emergency special session on Feb. 24, 2025.&quot; The news underscores Washington&apos;s shifting views on the Russia-Ukraine war since the accession of President Donald Trump. According to reporting from last week, the U.S. allegedly refused to co-sponsor a U.N. resolution on Russia&apos;s all-out war, which reaffirms Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity and condemns Moscow&apos;s aggression. More than 50 countries, including all EU states and Ukraine, are the authors of the collective draft. It calls Russia an aggressor country and demands that it withdraw its troops from all of Ukraine&apos;s territory. The U.N. General Assembly is expected to consider the two resolutions on Russia&apos;s war later on Feb. 24. The U.S. version of the resolution, dubbed the &quot;Path to Peace,&quot; reportedly does not name Russia as the aggressor but calls for &quot;an immediate end to the conflict.&quot; Moscow proposed adding a phrase to this sentence &#x2014; &quot;including by addressing its root causes,&quot; the media outlet reported. The authors of the collective and competing resolution proposed to replace the word &quot;conflict&quot; with &quot;Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine&quot; and to call for a &quot;just lasting peace&quot; instead of merely a &quot;lasting peace.&quot; Last week, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz avoided directly naming Russia the aggressor in its war against Ukraine in interviews with Fox News. The Pentagon chief acknowledged there was &quot;an invasion into Ukraine&quot; without naming Russia. When asked if it&apos;s fair to say that Russia attacked Ukraine without provocation in 2022, Hegseth replied that it&apos;s &quot;fair to say it&#x2019;s a very complicated situation.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed to mediate a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia while using increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Kyiv. He dubbed President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and accused Ukraine of starting the war. Soon after, Trump admitted that Russia launched a full-scale war by attacking Ukraine. &quot;Russia attacked, but they shouldn&apos;t have let him attack,&quot; Trump said. The U.S. also opposed directly calling Russia the &quot;aggressor&quot; in a G7 statement devoted to the anniversary of the invasion, according to the Financial Times, which marked the first time the U.S. has pushed back on such language.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-urges-un-members-to-vote-for-american-version-of-resolution-on-russias-war-resists-aggressor-lable-media-reports/	2025-02-24T05:43:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1676985291.jpg
Spain to provide Ukraine with military aid package worth over $1 billion in 2025	Spain will deliver a new 1 billion euro ($1.04 billion) military aid package to Ukraine in 2025, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced on Feb. 24 during the Support Ukraine summit in Kyiv. Sanchez announced the new military aid during his visit to Kyiv on the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;We are ready to continue to provide military assistance and equipment with even more determination than we have in the past. I am ready to announce a new package of military assistance to Ukraine worth 1 billion euros ($1.04 billion) in 2025,&quot; Sanchez said. The new package will be provided as part of a 10-year bilateral security agreement signed between Ukraine and Spain in May 2024. Last year, Madrid also provided over 1 billion euros ($1.04 billion) in military aid to Ukraine, according to the Spanish government&apos;s statement. Speaking in Kyiv, Sanchez said that Spain will work with Ukraine on its post-war recovery, encourage its companies to participate in Ukraine&apos;s projects and programs, and address the needs of the Ukrainian diaspora. &quot;We must ensure that Ukraine joins the EU soon. Ukraine&apos;s accession to the EU is the biggest victory for the Ukrainian people,&quot; he added. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Antonio Costa, leaders of the Baltic States, Spain, and Canada, as well as leaders of Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, arrived in Kyiv for the international summit on the morning of Feb. 24, the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Nordic countries announced new humanitarian and military aid for Ukraine the same day.	https://kyivindependent.com/spain-to-provide-ukraine-with-new-military-aid-package-worth-over-1-billion-in-2025/	2025-02-24T05:07:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201111218.jpg
Moscow open to ceasefire only when talks yield results that 'suit Russia,' Lavrov says	Russia will agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine only once negotiations provide a &quot;sustainable result&quot; that &quot;suits&quot; the Russian leadership, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Feb. 24, Russian state-controlled news agency RIA Novosti reported. Lavrov&apos;s comments come as the White House said a peace deal with Russia could be hashed out this week. U.S. President Donald Trump has intensified diplomatic outreach to Russia, announcing a second round of talks in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 25. &quot;The president (Vladimir Putin) has clearly said that we are ready to negotiate with Ukraine, with Europe, and with any representatives who, in a spirit of goodwill, would like to help achieve peace,&quot; Lavrov claimed. &quot;But we will cease hostilities only when these negotiations produce a firm, sustainable result that suits the Russian Federation. Of course, the realities on the ground must be considered,&quot; Lavrov added. Lavrov added that consultations with U.S. officials on the reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and the Russian Embassy in Washington are scheduled for this week. Preparations are also underway for a meeting between Trump and Putin, Russia&apos;s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Feb. 22. Trump previously said he would &quot;probably&quot; meet Putin before the end of February. The U.S. held the first round of talks directly with Russia on Feb. 18, excluding Ukraine from the meeting. The decision sparked a backlash in Europe and Ukraine, with European leaders worried they were being sidelined by the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/hostilities-to-end-only-when-negotiations-yield-result-that-satisfies-russia-lavrov-says/	2025-02-24T04:59:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2050986119.jpg

Boris Johnson backs Trump's deal on Ukraine's natural resources	Former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson voiced support for the U.S.-proposed deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources during an event in Kyiv on Feb. 24. &quot;The deal should be signed,&quot; Johnson said, speaking at the YES conference event held in Kyiv by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation on Feb. 24, the third anniversary of the Russian full-scale invasion. &quot;It commits the U.S. to a free and sovereign Ukraine. A continued American support is well worth the price for Ukraine.&quot; Ukrainian officials said earlier the same day that negotiations on the deal, which would entrench U.S. interests in Ukraine&apos;s resources, are in their final stages. Despite pressure from Washington, President Volodymyr Zelensky has been reluctant to sign the initial drafts of the deal as they lacked security commitments for Ukraine and because the $500 billion demanded by Washington vastly outnumbered the $100 billion provided under the previous U.S. administration. The initial White House proposal reportedly sought a 50% interest in Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas, as well as critical infrastructure and ports. Zelensky said Ukraine is not ready to &quot;split 50/50 without knowing what&#x2019;s ahead.&quot; Johnson compared the deal to the World War II-era lend-lease deal, emphasizing that the U.S. imposed a harsh deal for the U.K., which &quot;gave up a lot&quot; and had to pay the U.S. back until 2006. &quot;I think Trump is trying to show Republicans that he&#x2019;s got something. The tragedy is he&#x2019;s been listening for too long to Tucker Carlson, who pedals the Russian propaganda,&quot; the former British prime minister said. &quot;Ukraine will win. I remain defiantly optimistic about the chances of this country. (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is going to fail, Ukraine is going to succeed.&quot; Johnson was critical of Europe&#x2019;s unwillingness to confiscate the roughly $300 billion in frozen Russian assets, of which roughly two-thirds are held in European accounts. &quot;Who in Europe in the past two years has been talking about these billions? Why haven&#x2019;t we been hearing from European leaders about $300 billion?&quot; he said. &quot;We only talk about it in the rooms like this, at conferences. There&#x2019;s not enough political will to do it.&quot; While hesitant to confiscate the funds outright, the G7 members pledged a $50 billion loan for Ukraine covered by proceeds from the immobilized Russian assets. Johnson backed the idea of putting British troops on the ground, saying it is about showing Putin who is in charge and asserting Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty as a free country that &quot;can choose which clubs to join.&quot; &quot;Putin says to Ukraine (that) you can&#x2019;t have foreign boots on the ground. By rejecting that, we show who&#x2019;s in charge of Ukraine. That&#x2019;s all it&#x2019;s about. You make visible the fact of Ukrainian sovereignty and independence.&quot; The comments come as U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed readiness to deploy British peacekeepers to Ukraine to monitor a potential ceasefire. The Telegraph previously reported that Starmer&apos;s plan includes deploying 30,000 peacekeepers in Ukraine in case of a ceasefire, who would be backed by U.S. firepower.	https://kyivindependent.com/boris-johnson-backs-trumps-mineral-deal-for-ukraine/	2025-02-24T04:36:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198441762.jpg
Nordic countries to provide Ukraine with additional humanitarian, military, energy aid	Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland will allocate additional humanitarian, military, and energy aid to Ukraine, the governments announced on Feb. 24, the day marking the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The Nordic governments&apos; statements coincided with their leaders&apos; visits to Kyiv on the anniversary of the beginning of the all-out war. Denmark will allocate 405 million Danish kroner ($56.8 million) for humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts in Ukraine, the Danish Foreign Ministry announced. The situation in Ukraine is still &quot;very serious,&quot; the ministry said, adding that nearly 13 million people in Ukraine will need humanitarian assistance in 2025, according to the U.N. The new aid package will be split into two halves. One-half of the financial assistance will be earmarked for humanitarian aid and will go to &quot;basic aid such as food, medicine, water and shelter for Ukrainians in the most affected areas.&quot; The other half will be used for reconstruction efforts. The latest package will bring Denmark&apos;s total humanitarian aid to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion to more than 1 billion Danish kroner (over $140 million). Denmark&apos;s military assistance to Ukraine over this period has totaled about $7.5 billion, the statement read. Norway will provide 12.5 billion Norwegian kroner ($1.1 billion) to Ukraine, which will be used for humanitarian aid and energy security, among other spheres, according to the Norwegian Foreign Ministry. These funds are part of the allocation approved by the Norwegian parliament last November for the Nansen Support Program for Ukraine in 2025. Norway has so far allocated 35 billion Norwegian kroner ($3 billion) under this program, 12.5 billion Norwegian kroner ($1.1 billion) of which are dedicated to civilian expenditures and another 22.5 billion Norwegian kroner ($2 billion) for military support. Sweden will provide Ukraine with air defense systems worth 1.2 billion Swedish kroner (over $113 million). The funds are part of an aid package worth 13.5 billion Swedish kroner ($1.2 billion), which was announced in January. &quot;For the past three years, the Ukrainian people have been fighting for freedom and security &#x2014; theirs and ours,&quot; Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson wrote on X, marking his visit to Kyiv. &quot;Today, we are announcing 100 million euros ($105 million) to support Ukraine&apos;s air defenses. Strengthening Ukraine&apos;s capability to defend itself against Russian aggression also increases our security,&quot; Kristersson added. Finland, for its part, is providing 4.5 million euros ($4.7 million) through the Partnership Fund for a Resilient Ukraine (PFRU) for 2025-2027 to support Ukraine&apos;s resilience and stability, the Finnish Foreign Ministry announced. &quot;Rebuilding Ukraine and supporting basic services will contribute to the country&apos;s resilience, which is also needed to achieve lasting peace,&quot; Finnish Foreign Trade and Development Minister Ville Tavio said. Finland provided 4.3 million euros ($4.5 million) for the fund between 2022 and 2024. Over this period, the PFRU implemented 577 recovery projects, helped 2 million people access basic services, implemented media campaigns, and supported mental health services in eastern and southern Ukraine, the statement read.	https://kyivindependent.com/nordic-countries-to-provide-ukraine-with-additional-humanitarian-military-energy-aid/	2025-02-24T04:13:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201117138.jpg
Starmer announces UK's largest package of sanctions against Russia, confirms readiness to deploy peacekeepers in Ukraine	The U.K. is imposing its largest-ever package of sanctions against Moscow, targeting its &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of tankers and foreign-based companies providing military parts to Russia, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Feb. 24. &quot;Later today, I will be discussing further steps with the G7. And I am clear that the G7 should take more risk, including the oil price cap, sanctioning Russia&apos;s oil giants, and going after banks that are enabling the evasion of sanctions,&quot; Starmer said in a video address to the Support Ukraine summit in Kyiv. Starmer&apos;s announcement, made on the third anniversary of the full-scale war, comes shortly after Australia and New Zealand announced additional sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Kyiv&apos;s international partners are ramping up economic pressure on Moscow just as the Trump administration pushes for peace talks and signals that sanction relief could be part of an eventual peace deal. Starmer did not reveal the full details of the new package. The British prime minister reiterated that the U.K. is ready to provide Ukraine with 4.5 billion pounds ($5.7 billion) in military aid in 2025, the most significant yearly sum provided since the outbreak of the full-scale war. U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey previously announced the sum during the Ramstein-format meeting on Feb. 12. According to the media, London is also expected to announce an additional defense aid package later on Feb. 24. European countries are looking for ways to increase military support for Ukraine as the continued U.S. commitment grows uncertain under President Donald Trump. &quot;If we want peace to endure, Ukraine must have a seat at the table, and any settlement must be based on sovereign Ukraine, backed by strong security guarantees,&quot; Starmer said. &quot;The U.K. is ready and willing to support this with troops on the ground, with the Europeans, and with the right conditions in place,&quot; Starmer said, adding that the U.S. &quot;backstop&quot; will be crucial to deter any future Russian aggression. The British prime minister is expected to meet Trump in Washington later this week to discuss peace efforts in Ukraine. The Telegraph previously reported that Starmer&apos;s plan includes deploying 30,000 peacekeepers in Ukraine in case of a ceasefire, who would be backed by U.S. firepower.	https://kyivindependent.com/starmer-announces-largest-package-of-sanctions-against-russia/	2025-02-24T04:06:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194219228.jpg
Ukraine-US talks on natural resources deal in 'final stages,' Deputy PM says	The U.S.-Ukraine talks on the use of Ukrainian natural resources are in their &quot;final stages&quot; as &quot;nearly all key details (have been) finalized, &quot; Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration and Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna said on Feb. 24. &quot;We are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature,&quot; Stefanishyna said on X. While praising the talks as &quot;constructive,&quot; the official did not provide any details on the deliberations or the content of the deal. Negotiations on a deal to entrench U.S. interests in Ukraine&apos;s reserves are ongoing, with the latest draft presented by the White House reportedly demanding $500 billion of Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources, including critical minerals, to recuperate American aid to Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky has so far refused to sign the deal because it does not contain any security guarantees for Ukraine and because the $500 billion sum vastly outnumbers the $100 billion provided under former President Joe Biden as a grant. &quot;We hope both U.S. and Ukrainian leaders might sign and endorse (the deal) in Washington (as soon as possible) to showcase our commitment for decades to come,&quot; Stefanishyna said. The initial White House proposal reportedly sought a 50% interest in Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas, as well as critical infrastructure and ports. Zelensky said Ukraine is not ready to &quot;split 50/50 without knowing what&#x2019;s ahead.&quot;The Ukrainian leader also pointed out that the U.S. proposed to return future aid with an interest of 1:2. &quot;For every U.S. dollar, Ukraine must return two. In simple terms, this is 100% of the loan,&quot; he said. The Trump administration has ramped up the pressure on Ukraine to sign the deal, with U.S. President Donald Trump lambasting Zelensky in public as a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; and urging him to &quot;move fast, or he won&#x2019;t have a country left.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-us-talks-on-natural-resources-deal-in-final-stages-deputy-pm-says/	2025-02-24T03:21:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2150526931.jpg
Canada disbursing 1st tranche of its G7 loan contribution for Ukraine	Canada is disbursing the first installment of 5 billion Canadian dollars ($3.5 billion) it contributed to the G7&apos;s $50 billion loan for Ukraine, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Feb. 24. The G7 loan, shouldered mainly by the U.S. and the EU, will be repaid by proceeds from roughly $300 billion in Russian assets held in Western bank accounts. The Canadian prime minister did not specify the sum of the first installment. Speaking at the Support Ukraine summit in Kyiv, Trudeau also announced new military support for the besieged country. This assistance will include 25 LAV III infantry fighting vehicles, two combat support vehicles, and four F-16 flight simulators, provided &quot;on top of million rounds of ammunition, components for drone cameras, and first aid kits,&quot; Trudeau said. Since the outbreak of the full-scale war, Canada has allocated 4.5 billion Canadian dollars ($3.2 billion) in military assistance to Ukraine, a figure that includes future commitments through 2029.	https://kyivindependent.com/canada-disbursing-1st-tranche-of-its-g7-loan-contribution-covered-by-russian-assets/	2025-02-24T02:54:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2160972094.jpg
EU to provide Ukraine with $3.7 billion tranche in March	Ukraine will receive a new tranche of 3.5 billion euros ($3.7 billion) from the European Union in March, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Feb. 24 at the international Support Ukraine summit in Kyiv. Von der Leyen&apos;s statement came during her official visit to Kyiv on the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;Europe is here to strengthen Ukraine in this critical moment. I can announce that a new 3.5 billion euros ($3.7 billion) payment for Ukraine will arrive already in March,&quot; von der Leyen said. In 2025, the EU is expected to provide Ukraine with 35 billion euros ($36 billion) in financial assistance under the G7 Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) credit initiative and the Ukraine Facility program. The European bloc pledged to contribute 18.1 billion euros ($19 billion) to the G7-backed $50 billion loan for Ukraine, which will be repaid by proceeds from Russian assets. The EU and its member states have provided 134 billion euros ($140 billion) in support to Ukraine since the all-out war began, more than any single country, according to von der Leyen. &quot;Thanks to our Ukraine Facility and the G7 loan, we have closed Ukraine&apos;s budgetary gap for the entire year 2025,&quot; she stressed. On Jan. 10, Ukraine received 3 billion euros ($3 billion) from the EU, the first tranche of loans from the bloc funded by proceeds of frozen Russian assets.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-to-provide-ukraine-with-new-3-7-billion-tranche-in-march/	2025-02-24T02:29:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1763769676.jpg
All-for-all prisoner exchange could be step toward peace, Zelensky says	Russia releasing all of its Ukrainian captives would be a good step toward peace, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the Support Ukraine summit on Feb. 24. &quot;Ukraine is ready for an all-for-all exchange, it is a fair option,&quot; Zelensky said in an address to world leaders. The comments come amid growing expectations of peace talks in 2025 amid U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s push for a swift ceasefire. Russia and Ukraine have held a number of prisoner swaps throughout the full-scale war, most recently on Feb. 5, when 150 Ukrainian soldiers were brought back from Russian captivity. Ukraine does not reveal the exact figures on how many Ukrainian prisoners of war (POW) are held in Russia. According to Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets, Russia holds over 16,000 Ukrainian civilians. Moscow has also deported or forcibly displaced over 19,500 Ukrainian children, transporting them to Russia, Belarus, or other Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine. &quot;Thousands of people are being held in Russia. And some of them have been held not only since 2022, but much earlier, since 2014,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine floated the idea of an all-for-all prisoner exchange already back in 2024, but Russia has not agreed to the proposal.	https://kyivindependent.com/all-for-all-prisoner-exchange-could-be-step-toward-peace-zelensky-says/	2025-02-24T02:13:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156503093.jpg
Zelensky sent Trump list of all 'ceasefires' violated by Russia	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 24 he had provided U.S. President Donald Trump with a list of all ceasefires violated by Russia, warning against a quick peace deal without clear security guarantees. &quot;Peace cannot be concluded in an hour, a day, today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow,&quot; Zelensky said in an address to world leaders at the Support Ukraine summit in Kyiv. &quot;When General (Keith) Kellogg was in Kyiv, I handed him and the U.S. president a document with all the ceasefires, along with specific dates, that Russia had violated.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s comments come amid growing concerns that Trump is seeking to sideline Ukraine and Europe in possible peace negotiations to cut a deal with Russia. U.S. and Russian delegates held talks in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 without Ukraine&apos;s participation, with a follow-up meeting scheduled for Feb. 25. While no specific plans for a peace deal were announced, Trump&apos;s diplomatic outreach to Moscow comes hand-in-hand with his increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Ukraine and Zelensky. The U.S. president has lambasted Zelensky as a &quot;dictator without elections,&quot; echoing Russian propaganda narratives about the latter&apos;s legitimacy. Trump&apos;s aides have also been pushing Kyiv to sign a deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, which Zelensky said provides no security guarantees in return. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly warned that a swift ceasefire deal without strong security guarantees, such as continued military support or NATO membership, would give Russia time to regain strength and resume its aggression at a later date. &quot;Therefore, peace must be based on balanced diplomacy and clear security guarantees,&quot; Zelensky said at the summit.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-gave-trump-list-of-all-ceasefires-violated-by-russia/	2025-02-24T01:38:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2188254103.jpg
Kallas to visit US to meet Rubio, discuss peace efforts in Ukraine	The EU&apos;s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, will visit the U.S. on Feb. 25 to meet Secretary of State Marco Rubio and discuss efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war, Kallas told journalists on Feb. 24 before a ministerial meeting in Brussels. Kallas&apos;s statement comes after American and Russian delegations met in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 for talks on ending the war in Ukraine. Neither Ukraine nor the European Union was invited to participate. Kallas stressed that no agreement regarding Ukraine or Europe can work without their participation. The EU&apos;s top diplomat said she plans to discuss &quot;these and other issues&quot; with Rubio and other officials in the U.S. Reacting to U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s denouncing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as a &quot;dictator,&quot; Kallas noted that, unlike Ukraine, Russia has not had fair elections in 25 years. Kallas also suggested that &quot;the messages coming out of the U.S.&quot; regarding the elections in Ukraine suggest that &quot;the Russian narrative is very strongly represented there.&quot; Kremlin propaganda has pushed the narrative that Zelensky is an illegitimate leader, relying on the premise that his first presidential term was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024. Trump&apos;s claim ignores the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. As a result, Zelensky&apos;s term has been extended, which constitutional lawyers argue is permitted under Ukrainian law.	https://kyivindependent.com/kallas-to-visit-us-to-meet-with-rubio-discuss-peace-deal-on-ukraine/	2025-02-24T01:30:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1401349176.jpg
Russian consulate in Marseille attacked with Molotov cocktails, media reports	Two Molotov cocktails were thrown into the garden of the Russian consulate building in Marseille, France, on Feb. 24, the French news channel BFM TV wrote. Local media previously reported a blast near the Russian consulate building in the southern French city and firefighters working on site. No casualties were reported. The incident was confirmed by Russian Consul General in Marseille Stanislav Oransky, who said that an explosion occurred &quot;inside the consulate.&quot; Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova claimed the incident has all the hallmarks of a &quot;terrorist attack&quot; and urged &quot;swift investigation&quot; and &quot;strengthening the security of Russian foreign institutions,&quot; according to the Russian news agency RBK. French authorities have not commented on the identity of the perpetrators or the motivations behind the attack, which took place on the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The incident took place less than a month after a man attempted to drive a passenger car through the gates of Russia&#x2019;s Embassy in Stockholm, Sweden.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-consulate-in-marseille-attacked-with-molotov-cocktails-media-reports/	2025-02-24T01:07:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1239890156.jpg
Ukrainian drones reportedly strike Russian refinery in Ryazan Oblast for 3rd time in 2025	Drones operated by Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces struck an oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Ryazan Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 24. Kyiv considers oil refineries to be valid military targets, as profits from the fossil fuel industry fund Russia&apos;s war machine. This is the third time since the beginning of 2025 that drones have attacked the Ryazan Oil Refinery, according to the independent Telegram channel Astra. The Ryazan Oil Refining Company&apos;s facility was previously struck overnight on Jan. 24 and Jan. 26. At least five explosions were heard near the facility. According to preliminary data from the General Staff, the attack caused a fire near the primary oil processing facility. The full consequences of the attack are still being determined, according to the statement. Ryazan Oblast Governor Pavel Malkov confirmed that falling drone debris had caused a fire at &quot;one of the enterprises&quot; in the region. According to Malkov, no one was injured. Ryazan lies almost 500 kilometers (310 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border. The Ryazan Oil Refinery is one of Russia&apos;s five largest oil refining facilities, according to Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation. Its capacity is 17.1 million metric tons of oil per year. Kovalenko added that the fuel produced at the enterprise is used by the Russian army&apos;s strategic long-range aviation, which launches missile strikes against Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The Ryazan Oil Refinery previously suspended operations due to damage from Ukrainian drone attacks, Reuters reported on Jan. 27, citing two industry sources. Ukraine confirmed hitting the plant in an overnight drone strike on Jan. 24.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-attack-oil-refinery-in-russias-ryazan-oblast-for-3rd-time-since-beginning-of-2025/	2025-02-24T00:47:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Gkihz5AXAAEt9p2.jpeg
EU officially adopts 16th package of sanctions against Russia	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. The European Union officially approved its 16th package of sanctions imposed against Russia in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The new measures, announced on the third anniversary of the all-out war, target Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of oil tankers, banks, aluminum imports, and other sectors. &quot;For three years now, Russia has relentlessly bombed Ukraine, attempting to steal land that isn&#x2019;t theirs to take,&quot; the EU&apos;s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said in a statement. &quot;There is no doubt about who the aggressor is, who should pay and be held accountable for this war. Every sanction package deprives the Kremlin of funds to wage war.&quot; Forty-eight persons and 35 entities were listed in the 16th package of sanctions, which was approved by EU ambassadors last week. The package expands restrictions against the &quot;shadow fleet&quot; &#x2014; a group of aging tankers used to evade sanctions&#x2014;by targeting 73 additional vessels, bringing the total to 153. For the first time, the EU also imposed a transaction ban on financial institutions outside Russia that use the Russian System for Transfer of Financial Messages (SPFS), a Russian alternative to the international SWIFT payment system.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-officially-adopts-16th-package-of-sanctions-against-russia/	2025-02-24T00:12:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1252156264.jpg
Australia, New Zealand impose new sanctions against Russia	The Australian and New Zealand governments announced new sanctions against Russia on Feb. 24 in a show of solidarity with Ukraine on the third anniversary of the full-scale invasion. The new measures, imposed mere days after the EU&apos;s ambassadors approved the bloc&apos;s 16th package of sanctions, come as the Trump administration signaled that sanctions relief could be part of peace talks with Russia. Australia has introduced the most extensive package of sanctions since the beginning of the all-out war, targeting 70 individuals and 79 organizations linked to Russia, the government&apos;s statement read. Sanctions were imposed on Russian government officials and individuals involved in &quot;deepening cooperation between Russia and North Korea.&quot; North Korea has been Russia&apos;s leading ally during the full-scale war, providing artillery, ballistic missiles, and up to 12,000 soldiers deployed against Ukraine in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. The Australian government has imposed over 1,400 sanctions in response to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine since 2022 and has provided over 1.5 billion Australian dollars ($960 million) to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression, according to the statement. New Zealand announced sanctions against 52 individuals and entities &quot;involved in Russia&apos;s military-industrial complex and energy sector, North Korea&apos;s support to Russia&apos;s war effort, and the forced relocation or re-education of Ukrainian children,&quot; New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters said. The sanctions list includes governors of several Russian regions, heads of military-industrial complex enterprises, and military unit commanders. Restrictions were also imposed on Russian NGOs and charitable foundations. The New Zealand government further introduced sanctions on a senior North Korean military officer who provided strategic assistance to Russia&apos;s military efforts. Peters also announced an additional 3 million New Zealand dollars ($1.7 million) in contribution to the World Bank-administered Ukraine Relief, Recovery, Reconstruction, and Reform Trust Fund. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, New Zealand has imposed sanctions on more than 1,800 individuals and entities, along with a range of trade restrictions.	https://kyivindependent.com/australia-new-zealand-introduce-new-sanctions-against-russia/	2025-02-23T23:40:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1941899735.jpg

European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen arrived in Kyiv on Feb. 24 on the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. &quot;We are in Kyiv today, because Ukraine is Europe,&quot; von der Leyen said on X. &quot;In this fight for survival, it is not only the destiny of Ukraine that is at stake.

General Staff: Russia has lost 868,230 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 868,230 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 24. This number includes 1,050 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day.

Switzerland would consider sending 200 troops for potential peacekeeping role if requested, Swiss army chief says	Switzerland could contribute around 200 troops to a prospective peacekeeping mission in Ukraine if such a request were received and if the government agreed, Swiss armed forces chief Thomas Suessli said on Feb. 23. &quot;We could probably field around 200 soldiers in nine to 12 months,&quot; Suessli stated in an interview with Blick newspaper. He made the distinction between peacekeeping and peace-enforcement operations and said that Switzerland would not participate in any peace-enforcement operations as they involve some degree of force. &quot;Peace-enforcement means peace must be imposed by force of arms. Switzerland does not participate,&#x201D; he said. &quot;Peacekeeping presupposes Russia and Ukraine agree to cease hostilities and accept the UN sending a peacekeeping force to guarantee peace,&quot; Suessli added. However, he also noted that at this point there are no concrete requests from the UN, and that these questions are currently hypothetical. While refusing to supply Kyiv with military aid on account of its long-term neutrality policy, Switzerland has provided economic and humanitarian support worth over $3 billion. Switzerland also hosted the 2024 global peace summit, which had representatives from around 100 countries, as well as the 2022 Ukraine Recovery Conference in Lugano, which laid down principles for Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction and recovery.	https://kyivindependent.com/switzerland-would-consider-sending-200-troops-for-potential-peacekeeping-role-if-requested-swiss-army-chief-says/	2025-02-23T21:37:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-155097444.jpg
Sweden to transfer air defense systems to Ukraine estimated at $113 million in new aid package	Sweden has announced a transfer of air defense systems worth 1.2 billion Swedish krona (approximately $113 million) to Ukraine, Svenska Dagbladet reported on Feb. 23. This announcement was made by Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, Deputy Prime Minister Ebba Busch, and Minister of Education Johan Pehrson. Under this package, Stockholm will transfer Robot 70 and Tridon Mk2 systems to Ukraine. Previously, on Jan. 30, Sweden announced its largest tranche of military assistance since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022.

UK to ban entry for Russian elites as Starmer heads to Washington for Ukraine talks	The U.K. will impose a travel ban on individuals who have significant ties to the Russian state or have built their wealth through Kremlin connections. The U.K.&#x2019;s new sanctions come amid broader Western efforts to tighten pressure on Moscow as the war enters its fourth year. The sanctions, set to be announced on the third anniversary of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, will also target those with access to the highest levels of the Russian government, including senior politicians, officials, and business figures, the U.K. government said. The measures will expand existing British sanctions against Russian elites accused of supporting President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s war effort. British Security Minister Dan Jarvis made it clear that those benefiting from the Kremlin&#x2019;s actions will no longer be welcome. &quot;You are not welcome in the U.K.,&quot; he said. &quot;The measures announced today slam the door shut to the oligarchs who have enriched themselves at the expense of the Russian people whilst bankrolling this illegal and unjustifiable war.&quot; U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer will travel to Washington this week for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump on the war in Ukraine. His visit follows that of French President Emmanuel Macron, who is scheduled to meet Trump at the White House on Monday. Both leaders aim to persuade the U.S. president to avoid rushing into a ceasefire deal with Putin that could undermine Ukraine&#x2019;s security. European leaders have grown increasingly concerned over Trump&#x2019;s recent decision to engage in direct negotiations with Moscow without Kyiv&#x2019;s involvement. Starmer and Macron are expected to push for continued Western military support for Ukraine and stress the importance of European involvement in any peace process. They will also discuss potential military guarantees for Ukraine&#x2019;s future security.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-to-ban-entry-for-russian-elites-as-starmer-heads-to-washington-for-ukraine-talks/	2025-02-23T17:50:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200011633.jpg
Trudeau presses Trump on Ukraine peace deal ahead of Kyiv summit	Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged U.S. President Donald Trump to ensure any peace agreement for Ukraine includes security guarantees and prevents further Russian aggression. During a Feb. 22 phone call, Trudeau emphasized that any deal must not be seen as appeasement by Russian President Vladimir Putin, warning that it could lead to future land grabs in eastern Europe and the Baltics, according to a source with direct knowledge of the conversation. Trudeau left Ottawa on Feb. 23 for a summit in Kyiv, where world leaders will mark the third anniversary of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. The summit coincides with a video conference of G7 leaders on Monday, where the Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine will be a key topic. Trump recently authorized direct talks with Moscow on ending the conflict, excluding Kyiv from the negotiations. His administration&#x2019;s proposal would allow Russia to retain some occupied territories while transferring control of billions of dollars&apos; worth of Ukrainian natural resources to the U.S. President Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking at a Feb. 23 news conference, insisted that Kyiv must be part of any negotiation and said he would step down if it ensured Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership. However, he firmly rejected any deal that would hand over Ukraine&#x2019;s critical minerals to the U.S. &quot;I am not signing something that 10 generations of Ukrainians will have to repay,&quot; Zelensky said. French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer will travel to Washington this week in an effort to convince Trump not to abandon Ukraine. They plan to propose a European-led deployment of &quot;reassurance&quot; troops to bolster Ukraine&#x2019;s security. It remains unclear whether Canada will be asked to participate, but Trudeau&#x2019;s discussions with Trump suggest Ottawa remains committed to supporting Ukraine as the war enters its fourth year. Since the beginning of 2022, Canada has committed around $3.15 billion (CAD $4.5 billion) in aid to Ukraine, inlcuding air defense, ammunition, artillery, tanks, field equipment and clothing.	https://kyivindependent.com/trudeau-presses-trump-on-ukraine-peace-deal-ahead-of-kyiv-summit/	2025-02-23T16:45:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2160972094.jpg
CDU wins German election, Friedrich Merz raises NATO concerns	Germany&#x2019;s center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is set to return to power, with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) emerging as the second-largest party, according to exit polls. The snap election was driven by concerns over immigration, economic issues, and the return of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency. Cheers erupted at CDU headquarters on the evening of Feb. 23 as exit polls confirmed the opposition party&#x2019;s victory, according to CNN. Outside the building, a small group of demonstrators protested against CDU leader Friedrich Merz&#x2019;s stance on immigration. Declaring victory, Merz addressed supporters in central Berlin, saying, &quot;Let&#x2019;s get the party started,&quot; signaling his intent to begin coalition talks swiftly. With 28.8% of the vote, according to exit polls, Merz is expected to become Germany&#x2019;s next chancellor. A staunch conservative who has never held government office, he will lead Europe&#x2019;s largest economy. The AfD secured 20.2%, an unprecedented result for the far-right party, which has long been considered extremist. Merz expressed doubts about NATO&#x2019;s future following recent comments from the Trump administration. &quot;I would never have thought that I would have to say something like this in a TV show but, after Donald Trump&#x2019;s remarks last week... it is clear that this government does not care much about the fate of Europe,&quot; he told German broadcaster ARD. He also questioned whether NATO would remain intact by the June summit and stressed the urgency of building an independent European defense strategy. Known for his hardline stance on Russia, Merz has supported sending medium-range Taurus missiles to Ukraine, a move the outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz has firmly opposed. On Feb. 21, Merz criticized Trump&apos;s recent statements on Ukraine, calling them &quot;shocking&quot; and aligned with Russian narratives. &quot;This is the Russian narrative; this is how Putin has presented it for years, and I&apos;m frankly shocked that Donald Trump has now apparently embraced it himself,&quot; Merz added.	https://kyivindependent.com/cdu-wins-german-election-friedrich-merz-raises-nato-concerns/	2025-02-23T15:37:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200983429.jpg
Thousands rally across Europe, Canada ahead of 3rd anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion	Thousands of people rallied in support of Ukraine on Feb. 23 ahead of the third anniversary of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion which began on Feb. 24, 2022. Rallies were held across Europe on Sunday, with thousands of demonstrators lining the streets of Prague and Brussels. Czech President Petr Pavel addressed rally-goers in Prague, emphasizing his country&apos;s support for Ukraine. &quot;From what happened, I think it is quite clear who is the aggressor, who violated international law, and who is the victim, whose side we should stand on,&quot; Pavel said. &quot;And if we allow (international law) to be compromised, if we reward the aggressor, then sooner or later it will affect us too.&quot; Thousands also took to the streets of Brussels&apos; city center to mark the third anniversary. Amid the start of the fourth year to Russia&apos;s full-scale war, European allies have grown increasingly concerned over Kyiv&apos;s role in upcoming peace talks between Russia and the United States to end the war. European leaders have scrambled to deliver military support to Ukraine as the U.S., under the Trump administration, races to make a deal with Moscow. Trump has said he wants Europe to play a greater role in supporting Ukraine&apos;s financial and defense needs, but his administration has sent mixed signals as to whether Europeans are welcome in the negotiations process. Thousands of Ukrainian Canadians also attended a protest against Russian aggression in Toronto, Canada, in a rally attended by the Kyiv Independent.

(Dmytro Basmat/The Kyiv Independent)Chrystia Freeland, Canada&apos;s former Finance Minister, who is running to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, attended the rally and touted the country&apos;s support for Ukraine. &quot;In this fight, we are on the side of democracy versus dictatorship,&quot; Freeland, who is of Ukrainian descent, said during the rally. &quot;We are on the side of rule and order, and not bullies.&quot; Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said on Feb. 18 that Canada is interested in partaking in conversations about security guarantees for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/thousands-rally-across-europe-canada-ahead-of-3rd-anniversary-of-russias-full-scale-invasion/	2025-02-23T13:32:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/pxl_20250223_202453998.jpg
US envoy suggests Ukraine-Russia peace deal is close	The United States is reportedly nearing a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia, according to Steve Witkoff, the U.S. envoy to the Middle East. He said that any potential deal would require both territorial and economic concessions from both sides. &quot;You will see concessions from both sides. And this is what the president does best. He brings people together. He makes them understand that the path to peace is through concessions and reaching a consensus,&quot; Vitkoff said on Feb. 23. He also suggested that the 2022 Istanbul agreements could serve as the foundation for a future peace treaty between Ukraine and Russia. The Istanbul agreements between Ukraine and Russia in 2022 refer to a series of negotiations held in Istanbul, Turkey in late March 2022, shortly after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The produced communique outlined potential terms for a peace agreement including Ukraine adopting a neutral status and abandoning NATO aspirations, limits on Ukraine&apos;s military forces, Western security guarantees for Ukraine, negotiation of Crimea&apos;s status over 10-15 years, and allowing Ukraine to apply for EU membership. While these negotiations were seen as a potential breakthrough, with both sides reportedly considering significant concessions, they did not result in a final agreement and were halted in May 2022. Vitkoff linked the ongoing war to discussions about Ukraine&#x2019;s possible NATO membership, which he claimed Russia perceived as a threat. His remarks contrast with the position of the previous U.S. administration, which viewed Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion as unprovoked aggression. U.S. President Donald Trump said a new phase of ceasefire negotiations between American and Russian delegations aimed to stop Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine would take place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Feb. 25. This meeting follows the first round of discussions held in the same city earlier in the week. No Ukrainian officials were present at the Saudi negotiations. Following the initial meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlined three main objectives both sides had agreed to pursue. These include restoring embassy staff in Washington and Moscow, creating a high-level team to facilitate Ukraine peace talks, and exploring ways to strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-envoy-suggests-ukraine-russia-peace-deal-is-close/	2025-02-23T13:24:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199709214.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Zelensky willing to step down in exchange for peace; Russia launches largest drone attack since start of full-scale invasion	Key developments on Feb. 22-23: President Volodymyr Zelensky is ready to step down as president if it means &#x201C;peace for Ukraine,&#x201D; he said during the Ukraine: Year 2025 forum in Kyiv on Feb. 23.Talks about elections in Ukraine have amplified in recent months despite martial law prohibiting them. Zelensky, who was elected in 2019 for five years, came under fire from U.S. President Donald Trump who recently accused the Ukrainian leader of not wanting to hold elections.&#x201C;I am focusing on security today and not in 20 years time. I don&#x2019;t plan to be in power for 10 years,&#x201D; Zelensky told the forum.Ukraine has repeatedly said that it won&#x2019;t hold elections until the war is over, in line with martial law as Russia constantly bombards the country and occupies one-fifth of its territory. With Trump amping up peace negotiations with Russia this month, many expect an election to follow shortly after a ceasefire is agreed.These constraints have not stopped Trump from repeating Russian propaganda points and accusing Zelensky of being &#x201C;a dictator.&#x201D; Ukrainian NGOs have said organizing an election during the war is &#x201C;impossible,&#x201D; as elections must be preceded by a stable ceasefire backed by security guarantees and proper preparations for the election process, including restoring relevant infrastructure.Zelensky&apos;s administration pledged to hold elections &quot;immediately&quot; after the end of the war, thus allowing soldiers and refugees to safely take part in the vote as well.&quot;The Ukrainian consensus on elections no earlier than six months after the end of martial law is supported by the authorities, the opposition, and the society,&quot; the statement by the Ukrainian NGOs read.According to a February survey, 69% of Ukrainians believe that Zelensky should remain in office until the next elections can be held after the end of martial law. Several opposition politicians also supported this position, warning against Russian attempts to use the elections to divide society. Russia launched its largest single drone attack overnight since the start of the full-scale invasion with 267 drones entering Ukrainian airspace, Air Force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said on Feb. 23.Explosions were heard across the country, including in Kyiv where drone debris fell in the center of the capital and other districts that two houses and a post office, Kyiv&#x2019;s military head Tymur Tkachenko reported. Ukraine&#x2019;s air defense shot down 138 drones while 119 decoy drones were lost.While there were no reported casualties in Kyiv, three people were injured in Odesa Oblast after a fire broke out at a residential house, reported Odesa Oblast military head Oleh Kiper.In addition to the drone attacks, Russian forces also launched missiles at Ukraine. In Zaporizhzhia, a 53-year-old woman was injured after Russian shelling hit residential areas causing a fire.The worst attack occurred in Kryvyi Rih, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, where a missile strike killed one person and injured five. The attack inflicted heavy damage on the city&apos;s civilian infrastructure, including 12 apartment buildings, an infrastructure facility, a retirement home, and a church.The strike also caused damage to social and industrial buildings, a gas station, and multiple vehicles.The night before, a Russian drone attack killed a man in Kyiv Oblast. Several civilian buildings were damaged in the city, including an apartment block and an educational facility. The current U.S. proposal regarding Ukraine&apos;s critical minerals seeks 50% of revenues from Ukraine&apos;s natural resources while offering no security guarantees in return, according to a draft of the agreement seen by the New York Times (NYT). The U.S. and Ukraine have been working intensively over the past few days to hammer out the details of a revised version of the agreement. Ruslan Stefanchuk, speaker of Ukraine&apos;s parliament, said Kyiv aims to conclude the agreement on Feb. 24, the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The terms of the revised draft are virtually the same as those of an earlier version rejected by Zelensky, the NYT reported, citing a draft of the agreement dated Feb. 21. In some cases, the U.S. demands are even more stringent. The agreement demands 50% of revenues from Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas, as well as stakes in ports and other key infrastructure through a joint investment fund. The new version says that the U.S. would hold a 100% financial interest in this fund, and that Ukraine should contribute to the fund until it reaches $500 billion. This amount vastly exceeds Ukraine&apos;s actual resource revenues, which totaled $1.1 billion in 2024, and is over four times the value of U.S. aid to Kyiv. That $500 billion figure was not listed in the original proposal presented to Zelensky by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Feb. 12. Trump has cited the number in public comments, claiming on Feb. 10 that Ukraine had &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a $500 billion resource deal. When Zelensky then refused to sign the proposed agreement on the grounds that it offered no security guarantees, Trump lashed out at the Ukrainian president, echoing Kremlin talking points by calling him an &quot;unelected dictator.&quot; A visit from Trump&apos;s Special Envoy on Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, appeared to ease tensions and revive negotiations on the resource deal. U.S. and Ukrainian officials have reportedly been working through the night to hammer out an agreement. Trump said on Feb. 21 that the U.S. and Ukraine were &quot;pretty close&quot; to reaching a deal. The new document provides no specific security guarantees, according to the NYT. It instead says the U.S. will provide long-term economic development support for Ukraine. Trump said in early February that he wanted to strike a deal with Ukraine involving access to rare earth minerals in exchange for continued aid &#x2014; a change in U.S. foreign policy that turned support for Ukraine&apos;s defense and sovereignty into a business transaction. Ukraine said it was open to such a deal and has stressed the need for concrete security guarantees. A former senior Ukrainian official called the first U.S. proposal &quot;a colonial agreement&quot; and said Zelensky could not sign the document on those terms. Reuters reported on Feb. 21 that the U.S. has threatened to cut off Ukraine&apos;s access to Starlink internet terminals it it does not sign the agreement &#x2014; a claim SpaceX CEO and Trump ally Elon Musk has denied. Zelensky pushed back at the U.S.&#x2019; demand for a $500 billion fund to be financed with Ukrainian natural resource revenue, saying that the U.S.&#x2019;s aid grants are not debts, during the Ukraine: Year 2025 forum in Kyiv on Feb. 23. Zelensky said that he will not recognize such a large sum since it vastly outweighs the $100 billion the U.S. has sent to Ukraine under former President Joe Biden.The president added that the aid given to Ukraine cannot be counted as debts since they are grants and stressed that security guarantees need to be included in the deal. So far no such guarantees have been put in place, he said.&#x201C;I am not signing something that will be paid by 10 generations of Ukrainians,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that he wants a dialogue with Trump.The initial White House proposal sought a 50% interest in Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources, including critical minerals, oil and gas, as well as critical infrastructure and ports. Zelensky said Ukraine is not ready to &#x201C;split 50/50 without knowing what&#x2019;s ahead.&#x201D;The Ukrainian leader also pointed out that the U.S. proposed to return future aid with an interest of 1:2. &#x201C;For every U.S. dollar, Ukraine must return two. In simple terms, this is 100% of the loan,&#x201D; he said.The exact details of the current proposal have been kept secret but the administration of President Donald Trump has ramped up pressure on Kyiv to sign. Ukraine has had a back and forth with its American counterparts for nearly two weeks and Kyiv will start working to conclude an agreement with the U.S. on Feb. 24, said Ruslan Stefanchuk, speaker of Ukraine&apos;s parliament.The value and volume of Ukraine&#x2019;s critical minerals are unknown with the figure hotly debated among experts as assessments are based on old Soviet-era figures. However, $350 billion worth of natural resources are located in the Russian-occupied territories, First Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said at the forum. Arrangements for an in-person meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are already underway, Russia&apos;s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov claimed on Feb. 22. Trump previously said he would &quot;probably&quot; meet Putin before the end of February. The two leaders could discuss a broad range of global topics in addition to the war in Ukraine, Ryabkov told Russian state media. &quot;The question is about starting to move toward normalizing relations between our countries, finding ways to resolve the most acute and potentially very, very dangerous situations, of which there are many, Ukraine among them,&quot; he said. Preparations for the meeting are still in the early stages, Ryabkov said, and organizing the summit will require &quot;the most intensive preparatory work.&quot; U.S. and Russian delegates may hold meetings over the next two weeks in preparation for the Trump-Putin talks, he added. The U.S. and Russia have already held their first direct talks since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, signaling and end to Moscow&apos;s political isolation from the West. Representatives met in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 to discuss preliminary steps towards ending the war in Ukraine. Trump announced that U.S. and Russian envoys will hold another round of talks in Riyadh on Feb. 25. Ryabkov did not provide any details as to a potential date or location for the meeting between Trump and Putin. Trump has said that the leaders&apos; first meeting will take place in Saudi Arabia. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the possibilities of a Trump-Putin meeting with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, during the Saudi Arabia talks. Rubio said on Feb. 20 that a face-to-face meeting between the two leaders would depend on whether &quot;we can make any progress&quot; towards a peace agreement. Ukraine and European leaders have objected to Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the U.S.-Russia talks. Zelensky said he would not accept the outcome of any negotiations that did not involve Kyiv&apos;s participation. Trump has already spoken to Putin regarding his goal to broker a quick ceasefire in Ukraine. Trump spoke to Putin for nearly 90 minutes in a phone call on Feb. 12, holding a separate call with Zelensky later that day. Following the Riyadh talks, Putin announced that he would &quot;gladly&quot; meet with Trump and said he hoped Washington and Moscow would work out the war in Ukraine in advance of their meeting.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-zelensky-willing-to-step-down-in-exchange-for-peace-russia-launches-largest-drone-attack-since-start-of-full-scale-invasion/	2025-02-23T10:54:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/gettyimages-2201504268-612x612.jpg
Do international observers want to be placed in Pokrovsk?' — Zelensky criticizes calls for elections following Trump's comments	President Volodymyr Zelensky lambasted ongoing calls to hold elections in Ukraine during a press conference on Feb. 23 amid an unstable security situation across the country. &quot;If we held elections right now, it&apos;s understandable that for (Ukraine), in terms of security, it&apos;s the number one priority that we have a democratic situation, democratic elections, and that they are determined (to be legitimate),&quot; Zelensky said, ahead of listing a number question surrounding concerns over how an democratic election would be conducted amid the ongoing war. &quot;This is just not right. How can we call an election in which half of the population of the country won&apos;t be able to vote in?&quot; Zelensky question. &quot;How will they be able to vote?&quot; &quot;How will military personnel be able to vote? There&apos;s no way. How can we vote normally when today (Kyiv was) attacked with 267 drones?&quot; he added. Zelensky&apos;s remarks follow those of U.S. President Donald Trump who said on Feb. 18 that he believes Ukraine should hold new elections, alleging, without evidence. that Zelensky holds a &quot;4% approval rating.&quot; Trump further called Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; in a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Feb. 19, accusing him of refusing to have elections. A poll release the same day by the case of Ukraine (IBIF) project in partnership with the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) found that around 63% of Ukrainians approve of Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s actions as a president. Ukraine has repeatedly said that it won&#x2019;t hold elections until the war is over, in line with martial law as Russia constantly bombards the country and occupies one-fifth of its territory. Ukraine was scheduled to hold a presidential election in March or April 2024, concluding Zelensky&apos;s first five-year term. The vote was postponed as the country&apos;s constitution does not permit elections under martial law, which was declared on Feb. 24, 2022, at the onset of Russia&apos;s all-out invasion. Earlier in the press conference, Zelensky said he was ready to step down as president if it means &#x201C;peace for Ukraine.&quot; &#x201C;I am focusing on security today and not in 20 years time. I don&#x2019;t plan to be in power for 10 years,&#x201D; Zelensky told the forum. Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to use the delay to portray Zelensky as &quot;illegitimate,&quot; saying that the authority should pass to Parliament speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk, a claim rejected by Kyiv as a distortion of the constitution.	https://kyivindependent.com/do-international-observers-want-to-be-placed-in-pokrovsk-zelensky-criticizes-calls-for-elections-following-trumps-comments/	2025-02-23T10:13:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/gettyimages-2201504276-612x612.jpg
Hungary playing role in spreading disinformation about rationale for Russia's invasion to Trump's team, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a press conference on Feb. 23 that it was &quot;dangerous&quot; that members of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban&apos;s team are spreading disinformation about the rationale for the start of the war to members of U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s orbit. &quot;I know that there are people from this Hungarian leader who have contact with people in President Trump&apos;s orbit, and are constantly raising questions... in regards to not expanding NATO into eastern Europe,&quot; Zelensky said, criticizing Kremlin talking points that NATO was at fault for Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Orban, known for his close ties with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump, has openly criticized EU aid for Ukraine and obstructed sanctions against Moscow. Hungarian government insiders revealed that Trump sought Orban&#x2019;s opinion on strategies to end the Ukraine war multiple times after Trump&apos;s victory in the 2024 presidential election. In February 2024, Orban said that Ukraine should be left as a &quot;buffer zone&quot; between Russia and the West, with allies giving the country security guarantees but not accepting it into the EU or NATO. Trump has himself previously criticized former President Joe Biden for provoking Russia&#x2019;s invasion, claiming Ukraine&#x2019;s potential NATO membership had long been a significant concern for Moscow. &quot;I could understand their feelings,&quot; he said, referring to the country that launched the deadliest war in Europe since World War II. &quot;Is it not a risk that all the countries that became NATO members after various agreements between the (former) Soviet Union and the U.S. that they could all be under attack or occupation by the Russian army on their territory,&quot; Zelensky added, criticizing disproven talking points about NATO expansionism. &quot;This is why all this disinformation... is dangerous, and I want President Trump to speak to me &#x2014; with those at the table, not those who walk around the table.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s comments come amid a strained week in U.S.-Ukraine relations. Earlier in the week, Trump blamed Ukraine for starting the war, saying Kyiv &quot;should have never started it&quot; and instead should have &quot;made a deal.&quot;Later Trump added that Zelensky is not essential to negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. &quot;I don&apos;t think he&apos;s very important to be at meetings, to be honest with you,&quot; Trump told Fox News Radio on Feb. 21. Trump later conceded that Russia, not Ukraine, was the aggressor. &quot;Russia attacked, but they shouldn&apos;t have let him attack,&quot; he said. On Feb. 19, Trump called Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; in a post on his social media platform Truth Social, accusing him of refusing to have elections, and repeating false claims about the war in Ukraine. &quot;He refuses to have elections, is very low in Ukrainian polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing Biden &apos;like a fiddle,&apos;&quot; Trump wrote. A poll release the same day by case of Ukraine (IBIF) project in partnership with the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) found that around 63% of Ukrainians approve of Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s actions as a president.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-playing-a-role-in-spreading-disinformation-about-rationale-for-russias-invasion-to-trumps-team-zelensky-says/	2025-02-23T09:26:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/gettyimages-2201504268-612x612.jpg
Ukraine needs the US to win, says Polish PM	Polish President Andrezj Duda said Ukraine cannot win the war without U.S. support in a press briefing following a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, Polish media RMF 24 reported on Feb. 23. Duda and Trump met at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland on Feb. 22. After the conversation, the Polish leader told reporters that Trump is determined to end Russia&#x2019;s war on Ukraine adding that Russia cannot be allowed to win.However, he noted that the question remains of how to end the bloodshed. In his opinion, &quot;without American support, Ukraine will not survive this war&#x201D; and that the war &#x201C;has to be ended somehow.&#x201D; According to Duda, a just and sustainable peace is needed to make sure &quot;the war will not return and that Russia will not attack anyone again.&quot; The Polish Prime Minister discussed the peace negotiations with Trump, reminding him that Russian President Vladimir Putin is a former KGB officer. The White House said that a deal with Russia could be expected in the coming week. Duda, who has served as Prime Minister since 2015, previously said in November that he does not believe Trump will allow Russia to win. However, Ukraine is growing anxious that U.S. military support will end as Trump negotiates with Russia. Tensions have grown between the U.S. and Europe over peace negotiations, as Washington held direct talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 without Ukraine and Europe. European allies, including the U.K., have stressed that Ukraine needs to be directly involved in the negotiations. The next round of talks between the U.S. and Russia is planned for Feb. 25, in Riyadh.Duda&#x2019;s comments echo that of other European leaders, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who stressed that only a U.S. security guarantee can deter Russia from launching further aggression. He called for the U.S. to support a peacekeeping force in Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-needs-the-us-to-win-says-polish-pm/	2025-02-23T08:22:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1249297634-1.jpg
Zelensky won't sign natural resource deal that 'will be paid by 10 generations of Ukrainians'	President Volodymyr Zelensky pushed back at the U.S.&#x2019; demand for a $500 billion fund to be financed with Ukrainian natural resource revenue, saying that the U.S.&#x2019;s aid grants are not debts, during the Ukraine: Year 2025 forum in Kyiv on Feb. 23.Negotiations on a deal to entrench U.S. interests in Ukraine&apos;s reserves are ongoing, with the latest draft presented by the White House demanding $500 billion of Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources, including critical minerals, to recuperate American aid to Ukraine. Zelensky said that he will not recognize such a large sum since it vastly outweighs the $100 billion the U.S. has sent to Ukraine under former President Joe Biden.

Defense Minister: Ukraine has alternatives to Starlink system	Ukraine has alternatives for the Starlink internet system widely used by front-line units and is making decisions about the use of the technology, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said at the Ukraine: Year 2025 forum in Kyiv on Feb. 23.Tensions have been growing in recent months between Ukraine and Starlink&#x2019;s owner, billionaire Elon Musk, over his ties to Russia and comments about Ukraine. Recently, Reuters reported that the U.S. threatened to block Starlink access in Ukraine unless Kyiv signs a deal on its natural resources although this was denied by Musk. Starlink internet terminals have played a crucial role in securing communications in the war in Ukraine, with most battlefield positions equipped with their own terminal. Last year, Ukraine said that approximately 42,000 terminals were in operation across the military, hospitals, businesses, and aid organizations.Umerov did not specify what the alternatives were or go into details about the discussions. Last month, the Digital Transformation Ministry told the Kyiv Independent that Starlinks were still a critical part of communication on the frontline and that a new order was underway. The U.S. has the ability to remotely cut off Starlink connections and has previously turned off Starlinks belonging to Russian forces in the military &#x2018;gray zone&#x2019;, akin to no man&#x2019;s land, Ukrainian military intelligence head Kyrylo Budanov told reporters at the forum. No Starlinks belonging to Ukrainians have been turned off so far, he said. Umerov also noted that when it comes to U.S. provision for air defense missiles, &#x201C;the situation is controlled.&#x201D;Continued U.S. support to Ukraine is critical and Ukraine has a &#x201C;very low chance of survival&#x201D; without U.S. weapons, President Volodymyr Zelensky told NBC News on Feb. 15.

Economy Minister: Occupied Ukrainian territories have over $350 billion in natural resources	Ukraine has $350 billion worth of natural resources in the Russian-occupied territories, First Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said at the &#x2018;Ukraine. Year 2025&#x2019; forum in Kyiv on Feb. 23. The minister&apos;s comment comes as Kyiv and Washington negotiate a deal for Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources in return for support and security guarantees. The exact value and reserves of Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources, which include critical minerals like lithium and titanium, are only estimated and further calculations are underway. Kyiv turned down the White House&#x2019;s first proposal stating that it did not contact security guarantees although the U.S. has pressured Ukraine into signing an agreement over the last week. U.S. President Donald Trump first said that he wanted $500 billion in minerals to recuperate American aid to Ukraine. &#x201C;The agreement that may emerge must meet the national interests of Ukraine and at the same time be interesting for our partners,&#x201D; Head of the President&#x2019;s Office Andrii Yermak said at the forum. &#x201C;We view American and European investments in mineral extraction primarily as an element of security guarantees,&#x201D; he added. Details of the agreement have not been made public. However, the media leaked the White House&#x2019;s initial proposal on Feb. 12 revealing that the U.S. is seeking a 50% interest in minerals and other natural resources like oil and gas, as well as critical infrastructure, sparking outrage in Ukraine with some officials calling the deal &#x201C;colonial.&#x201D; Since then, there has been a back and forth, with Kyiv presenting its own proposal to the U.S. during the Munich Security Forum on Feb. 14. If done right, it could be a win-win for Ukraine, several figures in Ukraine&#x2019;s business community told the Kyiv Independent. One idea could be sharing a large amount of the resources in the occupied territories, which have resources like gas and lithium, with the U.S. if it helps Ukraine liberate them from Russia, said Ukrainian MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak. Ukraine will start working to conclude an agreement with the U.S. on Feb. 24, Ruslan Stefanchuk, speaker of Ukraine&apos;s parliament, told Japanese media outlet NHK on Feb. 22.	https://kyivindependent.com/economy-minister-occupied-ukrainian-territories-have-over-350-billion-in-natural-resources/	2025-02-23T06:14:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1679993124.jpg
Foreign Minister: Ukraine plans to end war this year	Ukraine plans to end the war this year with a just peace, Ukraine&#x2019;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said at the Ukraine: Year 2025 conference in Kyiv on Feb. 23. Sybiha noted that this is the goal of President Volodymyr Zelensky and told partners that &#x201C;it is time to fasten our diplomatic seat belts&#x201D; and &#x201C;not give in to emotions.&#x201D;&#x201C;We are convinced that we really have a chance to end the war this year,&#x201D; Sybiha said. The minister&apos;s comments come as the White House announced that a peace deal with Russia could be hashed out this week. President Donald Trump has amped up negotiation efforts in the last week, with plans to hold a second round of peace talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 25. Preparations are underway for a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russia&apos;s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Feb. 22. Trump previously said he would &quot;probably&quot; meet Putin before the end of February. The U.S. held the first round of talks directly with Russia on Feb. 18, although notably did not include Ukraine in the meeting. The decision sparkeda backlash in Europe and Ukraine, with Europeans worried they are being sidelined by the U.S. Sybiha stressed that cooperation with the U.S. is important in order to achieve a just peace. Trump previously said that Zelensky is not important to the peace negotiations. Tensions have arisen in recent days after Trump labeled Zelensky a dictator and claimed that Ukraine started the war against Russia. He later walked back on the comment and admitted that Russia attacked Ukraine, although said Ukraine &#x201C;shouldn&#x2019;t have let&#x201D; Russia attack.	https://kyivindependent.com/foreign-minister-ukraine-plans-to-end-war-this-year/	2025-02-23T05:20:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197755028.jpg
Russia launches largest drone attack since start of full-scale invasion	Russia launched its largest single drone attack overnight since the start of the full-scale invasion with 267 drones entering Ukrainian airspace, Air Force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said on Feb. 23. Explosions were heard across the country, including in Kyiv where drone debris fell in the center of the capital and other districts that two houses and a post office, Kyiv&#x2019;s military head Tymur Tkachenko reported. Ukraine&#x2019;s air defense shot down 138 drones while 119 decoy drones were lost. While there were no reported casualties in Kyiv, three people were injured in Odesa Oblast after a fire broke out at a residential house, reported Odesa Oblast military head Oleh Kiper. In addition to the drone attacks, Russian forces also launched missiles at Ukraine. In Zaporizhzhia, a 53-year-old woman was injured after Russian shelling hit residential areas causing a fire. The worst attack occurred in Kryvyi Rih, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, where a missile strike killed one person and injured five. The attack inflicted heavy damage on the city&apos;s civilian infrastructure, including 12 apartment buildings, an infrastructure facility, a retirement home, and a church. The strike also caused damage to social and industrial buildings, a gas station, and multiple vehicles.The night before, a Russian drone attack killed a man in Kyiv Oblast. Several civilian buildings were damaged in the city, including an apartment block and an educational facility.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-largest-drone-attack-since-start-of-full-scale-invasion/	2025-02-23T02:28:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/air-defenses.jpg
Starmer urges Trump to put Ukraine at center of peace negotiations	British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will tell U.S. President Donald Trump that Ukraine must be &#x201C;at the heart&#x201D; of any peace negotiations, the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Office reported on Feb. 22. In the leadup to the third anniversary of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Starmer reiterated the U.K.&#x2019;s support for Ukraine and its commitment to a &#x201C;just and enduring&#x201D; peace in a call with President Volodymyr Zelensky. The call came a day after Trump said that Zelensky was not important in negotiations having previously labeled the Ukrainian leader a &#x201C;dictator.&#x201D; Trump&#x2019;s rhetoric and decision-making have alarmed allies, particularly after Washington held direct talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 without Ukraine and Europe. Starmer will visit Washington D.C. in the coming week where he will meet Trump and emphasize that Kyiv &#x201C;must be at the heart of any negotiations to end the war.&#x201D; Protecting Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty is &#x201C;essential&#x201D; to prevent further Russian aggression, the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Office added. Trump has repeatedly said he wants to negotiate a swift end to the full-scale war. On Feb. 22, the White House announced that a deal to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine could be reached as early as this week. Trump previously said he would &quot;probably&quot; meet Putin before the end of February. Arrangements for an in-person meeting between the two leaders are already underway, Russia&apos;s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov claimed on Feb. 22. With U.S. and Russian delegations already meeting in Saudi Arabia, Europe is pushing not to be sidelined from the process. Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said on Feb. 15 that Europe will not be directly involved in negotiations, but its interests will be considered.Starmer has ramped up vocal support for Kyiv in the last weeks and even said that British peacekeeping troops could be deployed to Ukraine. He also called on Trump to provide American military backing for a proposed European peacekeeping force in Ukraine, arguing that only a U.S. security guarantee can deter Russia from launching further aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/starmer-urges-trump-to-put-ukraine-at-center-of-peace-negotiations/	2025-02-23T01:04:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193601148.jpg

Russian missile attack in Kryvyi Rih kills 1, injures 5	Russia launched a missile attack on the city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast late in the evening on Feb. 22, killing one person and injuring five others. The missile attack left one person dead and five others wounded, Oleksandr Vilkul, head of the city&apos;s military administration &#xA0;reported. Four women and one man were injured. Three of the injured victims have been hospitalized, with one woman reportedly in critical condition. She is being treated in the hospital&apos;s intensive care unit. The attack inflicted heavy damage on the city&apos;s civilian infrastructure, Vilkul said. Twelve apartment buildings, an infrastructure facility, a retirement home, and a church sustained damage. The strike also caused damage to social and industrial buildings, a gas station, and multiple vehicles. A fire that broke out at the site of the attack has been extinguished, Vilkul reported. Kryvyi Rih, President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s hometown, is a frequent target of Russian missile strikes. With a population of approximately 660,000, it is the second-largest city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and lies about 70 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of the nearest front-line zone.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-in-kryvyi-rih-kills-1-injures-5/	2025-02-22T21:47:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/kryvyirih.jpg
Investigation names over 95,000 Russians killed in Ukraine	The names of over 95,000 Russians who died fighting in Ukraine have been verified in a joint investigative project by the BBC&apos;s Russia service and the independent media outlet Mediazona, the BBC reported on Feb. 22. Over 5,000 names have been added to the list of Russian casualties since Jan. 24. The project has been collecting data on losses since February 2022. While the project confirmed over 95,000 deaths since Russia launched its full-scale invasion, the true death toll is believed to be much highter. Military analysts consulted by researchers estimated that the list likely represents only 45% to 65% of Russia&apos;s total casualties. The current list includes 16,171 Russian convicts who were recruited from penal colonies to fight in Ukraine. The total number of convicts who have died on the front lines is likely much higher. Prisoners could account for a third of Russia&apos;s military losses since the full-scale invasion, researchers said. Russia has been recruiting prisoners for the war in Ukraine since the summer of 2022. Investigators verified the names of the dead using data from official reports, newspapers, social media, and graveyards. Russia has not released official figures on its military deaths in Ukraine since September 2022, when the Kremlin claimed only 5,937 personnel had been killed in the war. President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on Feb. 15 that nearly 250,000 soldiers fighting for Russia&apos;s armed forces have been killed in the war against Ukraine. Russian forces have suffered heavy losses in recent months amid Moscow&apos;s accelerating offensive in eastern Ukraine. Troop losses reached record levels in November and December, with casualties continuing to mount in 2025. According to Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces, Russia lost more soldiers fighting in the direction of Pokrovsk, a small city in Donetsk Oblast, than its total losses in the Second Chechen War.	https://kyivindependent.com/investigation-names-over-95-000-russians-killed-in-ukraine/	2025-02-22T20:32:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2159525304.jpg
Trump team could strike a deal to end war 'this week,' White House says	U.S. President Donald Trump is &quot;very confident&quot; that he will reach a deal to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, possibly as early as &quot;this week,&quot; White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Feb. 22. Trump has repeatedly said he wants to negotiate a swift end to the full-scale war. Members of his administration held direct talks with Russian officials earlier this week and are currently working to secure a critical minerals deal with Ukraine. &quot;The president, his team are very much focused on continuing negotiations with both sides of this war to end the conflict, and the president is very confident we can get it done this week,&quot; Leavitt said following the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Feb. 22. U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz will be &quot;working around the clock all weekend to get a deal and end this conflict with Ukraine,&quot; she said. According to Leavitt, Trump is confident that Moscow is prepared to negotiate an agreement to end the war. &quot;He believes very strongly that Russia is willing to make a deal, he&apos;s fighting to make a deal,&quot; she said. &quot;The president said he wants the killing to stop, he wants to stop seeing innocent men die, and he wants peace.&quot; Leavitt did not provide any additional details on the types of peace negotiations that would take place in the coming days. Trump previously announced that the U.S. and Russia would hold a second round of talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Feb. 25. Ukraine was not invited to participate in the Saudi Arabia discussions. In his address at CPAC earlier in the day, Trump claimed that the U.S. and Ukraine were &quot;pretty close&quot; to a deal regarding Ukraine&apos;s critical natural resources. The two countries have been working intensively over the past few days to hammer out the details of a revised version of the agreement after President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected an initial proposal on the grounds that it did not offer concrete security guarantees. Trump said at the conference that the deal would compensate the U.S. for the aid it sent Ukraine after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. &quot;I want them to give us something for all of the money that we put up,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re asking for rare earth and oil &#x2014; anything we can get.&quot; Leavitt told reporters that the resource agreement was &quot;very important&quot; to Trump. &quot;When it comes to the critical minerals, this is an important piece for the president,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s very important for the president, because it will recoup American tax dollars. And it also will be a great economic partnership between the United States of America and for the Ukrainian people as well, as they rebuild their country following this brutal war.&quot; Officials from the U.S. and Ukraine have indicated that they believe an agreement will be reached soon, but a draft of the new proposal seen by the New York Times (NYT) provides no specific security guarantees for Kyiv in exchange for 50% of the revenues from Ukraine&apos;s natural resources. Zelensky has objected to Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the U.S.-Russia negotiations and dismissed any potential outcomes of talks that do not involve Kyiv&apos;s direct participation. Trump&apos;s overtures toward Russia &#x2014;&#xA0;coupled with increasingly hostile rhetoric towards Zelensky and Ukraine &#x2014;&#xA0;have alarmed Kyiv and leaders across Europe. This week marks the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russia launched the all-out war on Feb. 24, 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-team-could-strike-a-deal-on-ending-war-this-week-white-house-says/	2025-02-22T19:29:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200647187.jpg
Trump-Putin meeting preparations already underway, Russia claims	Arrangements for an in-person meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are already underway, Russia&apos;s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov claimed on Feb. 22. Trump previously said he would &quot;probably&quot; meet Putin before the end of February. The two leaders could discuss a broad range of global topics in addition to the war in Ukraine, Ryabkov told Russian state media. &quot;The question is about starting to move toward normalizing relations between our countries, finding ways to resolve the most acute and potentially very, very dangerous situations, of which there are many, Ukraine among them,&quot; he said. Preparations for the meeting are still in the early stages, Ryabkov said, and organizing the summit will require &quot;the most intensive preparatory work.&quot; U.S. and Russian delegates may hold meetings over the next two weeks in preparation for the Trump-Putin talks, he added. The U.S. and Russia have already held their first direct talks since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, signaling and end to Moscow&apos;s political isolation from the West. Representatives met in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 to discuss preliminary steps towards ending the war in Ukraine. Trump announced that U.S. and Russian envoys will hold another round of talks in Riyadh on Feb. 25. Ryabkov did not provide any details as to a potential date or location for the meeting between Trump and Putin. Trump has said that the leaders&apos; first meeting will take place in Saudi Arabia. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the possibilities of a Trump-Putin meeting with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, during the Saudi Arabia talks. Rubio said on Feb. 20 that a face-to-face meeting between the two leaders would depend on whether &quot;we can make any progress&quot; towards a peace agreement. Ukraine and European leaders have objected to Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the U.S.-Russia talks. President Volodymyr Zelensky said he would not accept the outcome of any negotiations that did not involve Kyiv&apos;s participation. Trump has already spoken to Putin regarding his goal to broker a quick ceasefire in Ukraine. Trump spoke to Putin for nearly 90 minutes in a phone call on Feb. 12, holding a separate call with Zelensky later that day. Following the Riyadh talks, Putin announced that he would &quot;gladly&quot; meet with Trump and said he hoped Washington and Moscow would work out the war in Ukraine in advance of their meeting.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-putin-meeting-preparations-already-underway-russia-claims/	2025-02-22T17:53:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-810261630.jpg
We're going to get our money back' — Trump on US-Ukraine resources deal	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 22 that the United States would &quot;get our money back&quot; after Ukraine agrees to a deal giving Washington access to half its revenues from critical natural resources. &quot;We&apos;re going to get our money back because it&apos;s just not fair,&quot; Trump said at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Feb. 22. &quot;And we will see, but I think we&apos;re pretty close to a deal, and we better be close to a deal.&quot; The U.S. and Ukraine have been working intensively over the past few days to hammer out the details of a revised version of the resources agreement after President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected an initial proposal on the grounds that it did not offer concrete security guarantees. Officials from both countries have indicated that they believe an agreement will be reached soon, but a draft of the new proposal seen by the New York Times (NYT) provides no specific security guarantees for Ukraine. Trump has said that the U.S. deserves compensation for the military aid it has donated to Ukraine since Russia launched the full-scale invasion in 2022. &quot;I want them to give us something for all of the money that we put up,&quot; he said at CPAC. &quot;We&apos;re asking for rare earth and oil &#x2014; anything we can get. I&apos;m trying to get the money back or secured.&quot; The U.S. deal currently on the table demands 50% of revenues from Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas, as well as stakes in ports and other key infrastructure through a joint investment funds. The new version says that the U.S. would hold a 100% financial interest in this fund, and that Ukraine should contribute to the fund until it reaches $500 billion, according to the NYT. While Trump claims he wants to &quot;get the money back&quot; for the U.S., Washington has provided around $100 billion &#x2014;&#xA0;not $500 billion &#x2014;&#xA0;in aid to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war. Trump has cited the $500 billion figure in public comments, claiming on Feb. 10 that Ukraine had &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a $500 billion resource deal. That figure was not included in the original version of the deal presented to Zelensky on Feb. 12. Zelensky&apos;s rejection of the U.S. resource deal triggered a barrage of insults from Trump, who accused the Ukrainian president of being an &quot;unelected dictator.&quot; Reuters reported on Feb. 21 that the U.S. has threatened to cut off Ukraine&apos;s access to Starlink internet terminals it it does not sign the agreement &#x2014; a claim SpaceX CEO and Trump ally Elon Musk has denied.	https://kyivindependent.com/were-going-to-get-our-money-back-trump-on-us-ukraine-resources-deal/	2025-02-22T16:46:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201345531.jpg
Russia exceeded mobilization goals in occupied Ukrainian territories last year, official says	Russia fulfilled its goal of mobilizing thousands of men in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine last year, Bohdan Okhrimenko, head of the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, told the news outlet Ukrinform in an interview Feb. 22. In its efforts to avoid an unpopular mass mobilization campaign at home, Russia has illegally drafted thousands of residents living in occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, as well as in occupied Crimea. Russia exceeded its mobilization goals for these regions in 2024, Okhrimenko told Ukrinform, citing Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR). &quot;In 2024, Russia had to mobilize thousands of people from the newly occupied territories and those who had previously been under occupation,&quot; Okhrimenko said. &quot;According to &#xA0;(HUR), this plan has been fulfilled by 104%. They have a plan for mobilization here and for the current year. It is also thousands of people.&quot; Okhrimenko did not say exactly how many people in the occupied territories had been drafted into the Russian military. The Ukrainian government is working on amending legislation to remove prisoner of war (POW) status from forcibly mobilized Ukrainians who are later captured in Ukraine. &quot;There is a certain legal incident in international documents, international law, so we are working on amending Resolution No. 413 and a number of other resolutions,&quot; Okhrimenko said. Since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, Russia has supplemented its troops by forcibly drafting tens of thousands of Ukrainians in occuped territories. Nearly 5,500 residents of Russian-occupied Crimea were mobilized into the Russian army in 2024 &#x2014;&#xA0;a year that saw record personnel losses as Moscow ramped up its offensive in eastern Ukraine. Forced conscription under occupation constitutes a war crime under international law.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-exceed-mobilization-goals-in-occupied-ukrainian-territories-last-year-official-says/	2025-02-22T16:03:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2164323055.jpg
US mineral deal offers no security guarantees for Ukraine, NYT reports	The current U.S. proposal regarding Ukraine&apos;s critical minerals seeks 50% of revenues from Ukraine&apos;s natural resources while offering no security guarantees in return, according to a draft of the agreement seen by the New York Times (NYT). The U.S. and Ukraine have been working intensively over the past few days to hammer out the details of a revised version of the agreement. Ruslan Stefanchuk, speaker of Ukraine&apos;s parliament, said Kyiv aims to conclude the agreement on Feb. 24, the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. &#xA0; The terms of the revised draft are virtually the same as those of an earlier version rejected by President Volodymyr Zelensky, the NYT reported, citing a draft of the agreement dated Feb. 21. In some cases, the U.S. demands are even more stringent. The agreement demands 50% of revenues from Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas, as well as stakes in ports and other key infrastructure through a joint investment fund. The new version says that the U.S. would hold a 100% financial interest in this fund, and that Ukraine should contribute to the fund until it reaches $500 billion. This amount vastly exceeds Ukraine&apos;s actual resource revenues, which totaled $1.1 billion in 2024, and is over four times the value of U.S. aid to Kyiv. That $500 billion figure was not listed in the original proposal presented to Zelensky by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Feb. 12. U.S. President Donald Trump has cited the number in public comments, claiming on Feb. 10 that Ukraine had &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a $500 billion resource deal. When Zelensky then refused to sign the proposed agreement on the grounds that it offered no security guarantees, Trump lashed out at the Ukrainian president, echoing Kremlin talking points by calling him an &quot;unelected dictator.&quot; A visit from Trump&apos;s Special Envoy on Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, appeared to ease tensions and revive negotiations on the resource deal. U.S. and Ukrainian officials have reportedly been working through the night to hammer out an agreement. Trump said on Feb. 21 that the U.S. and Ukraine were &quot;pretty close&quot; to reaching a deal. The new document provides no specific security guarantees, according to the NYT. It instead says the U.S. will provide long-term economic development support for Ukraine. Trump said in early February that he wanted to strike a deal with Ukraine involving access to rare earth minerals in exchange for continued aid &#x2014;&#xA0;a change in U.S. foreign policy that turned support for Ukraine&apos;s defense and sovereignty into a business transaction. Ukraine said it was open to such a deal and has stressed the need for concrete security guarantees. A former senior Ukrainian official called the first U.S. proposal &quot;a colonial agreement&quot; and said Zelensky could not sign the document on those terms. Reuters reported on Feb. 21 that the U.S. has threatened to cut off Ukraine&apos;s access to Starlink internet terminals it it does not sign the agreement &#x2014;&#xA0;a claim SpaceX CEO and Trump ally Elon Musk has denied.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-mineral-deal-offers-no-security-guarantees-for-ukraine-nyt-reports/	2025-02-22T14:57:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1843522320.jpg
Ukraine expects further F-16 deliveries from the Netherlands, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky has confirmed that Ukraine anticipates continued deliveries of F-16 fighter jets from the Netherlands, emphasizing their importance in securing the country&#x2019;s airspace. Following his meeting with Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof at the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky stressed that bolstering Ukraine&#x2019;s air defenses remains a top priority. &quot;The sky over Ukraine must be closed and safe,&quot; he said on Feb. 22, highlighting the critical role of military support in countering Russian aggression. The president thanked the Netherlands for its ongoing assistance and commitment to increasing military aid. He emphasized that strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s defense capabilities is crucial not only for the country&#x2019;s security but also for broader European stability. Several countries have contributed F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine&apos;s defense efforts, with the Netherlands playing a significant role by committing 24 F-16s, the first batch of which arrived in summer 2024. Denmark has pledged 19 F-16s, with initial deliveries made in 2024, while Norway has promised between 6 and 22 aircraft. Belgium has also announced its intention to supply F-16s, though the exact number remains undisclosed. Zelensky also reiterated Ukraine&#x2019;s firm stance on international negotiations, stating: &quot;Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine, nothing about Europe without Europe.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-expects-further-f-16-deliveries-from-the-netherlands-zelensky-says/	2025-02-22T13:20:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1601919862.jpg
Musk denies US threat to cut Starlink over Ukraine minerals deal	Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has denied reports that the United States threatened to shut off Starlink in Ukraine unless Kyiv agreed to a minerals deal. Responding to a report by Reuters, Musk called the claim &quot;false&quot; and accused the news agency of lying. He offered no evidence to back up his statement. His response came after the Kyiv Independent shared the news, which cited anonymous sources alleging that Starlink&apos;s continued operation in Ukraine was being tied to an agreement over mineral resources. This is false. Reuters is lying. They are second only to AP (Associated Propaganda) as legacy news liars. https://t.co/UwbDPk7MWj The U.S. has threatened to cut Ukraine&#x2019;s access to Starlink if Kyiv doesn&#x2019;t agree to a critical minerals deal, Reuters reported on Feb. 21, citing sources. Negotiations are ongoing after President Zelensky refused an initial proposal, though Trump said a deal is near. SpaceX began providing Starlink terminals to Ukraine shortly after the full-scale invasion, giving Kyiv a crucial communications advantage on the battlefield. Since then, however, Musk has grown increasingly vocal in criticizing Ukraine. Musk, who Trump has tasked with eliminating &quot;fraud&quot; and &quot;waste&quot; from the government budget, has called for shutting down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), an organization that provides vital humanitarian aid to Ukraine. He has also amplified Russian disinformation and mocked Zelensky for calling Ukraine an independent country. Musk&apos;s comments on X are often misleading or outright false.	https://kyivindependent.com/musk-denies-us-threat-to-cut-starlink-over-ukraine-minerals-deal/	2025-02-22T12:01:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194950593.jpg
EU considers confiscating part of Russia’s frozen $280 billion, Bloomberg reports	The European Union is intensifying discussions on how to seize Russia&#x2019;s frozen central bank assets to provide financial and military aid to Ukraine, as concerns grow that the United States may scale back its support. EU officials are considering using these assets as collateral for a proposed International Claims Commission, which would assess damages owed to Ukraine, people familiar with the talks told Bloomberg. If Russia refuses to pay, the assets could be confiscated. The initiative follows signals from Washington that Ukraine may receive less assistance moving forward. Discussions on asset seizure come amid escalating tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump recently criticized Zelensky, calling him a &quot;dictator&quot; and falsely blaming Ukraine for Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. As a result, Zelensky has urged European leaders to take greater responsibility in ensuring Ukraine receives sustained financial and military backing. The EU, along with the Group of Seven and Australia, has already frozen approximately $280 billion in Russian central bank assets, primarily held by the Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear. An additional $58 billion in private Russian assets, including luxury properties and yachts, has been frozen under sanctions. Despite support from EU officials such as Valdis Dombrovskis and Maria Lu&#xED;s Albuquerque, EU&apos;s financial services commissioner, the proposal to confiscate Russian assets faces legal and economic hurdles. Some EU nations, including Germany and France, have voiced opposition, warning that such a move could have significant repercussions for the international role of the euro and undermine legal frameworks governing sovereign assets. Another option under review involves directing EU member states to seize Russian assets specifically to fund the reconstruction of Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure, though legal justifications remain under debate. The G7 has already pledged profits generated from frozen Russian assets to back a $50 billion loan for Ukraine. Meanwhile, EU legal teams are assessing whether judicial rulings would be necessary to authorize full asset confiscation or if a damage assessment alone could suffice. The European Commission recently informed EU ambassadors that negotiations to establish the International Claims Commission will begin on March 24. The commission&apos;s role will be to determine the exact amount Russia must pay for war damages.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-considers-confiscating-part-of-russias-frozen-280-billion-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-22T10:57:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158001247.jpg

Yesterday, drone pilots of his unit, the 23rd Special Purpose Battalion of Ukraine&#x2019;s Presidential Brigade, were hunting Russian infantrymen in the mine buildings; videos on Babai&#x2019;s phone show the last moments of the enemy soldiers&#x2019; lives, caught unaware as the drones flew right through the windows. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s just meat, meat, meat;&#x201D; says Babai of his enemy&#x2019;s tactics, &#x201C;they mobilize someone, and within a week, they&#x2019;re already sitting in a trench. They have this human conveyor belt, and they&#x2019;ll keep sending more and more.&#x201D; &#x201C;Here, the soldiers are unprepared &#x2014; there&#x2019;s no elite assault force or anything like that, just cannon fodder. They give them a rifle, tell them, &#x2018;Go there, those are your comrades, and shoot at anything that moves.&#x2019;&#x201D; A photo of a Ukrainian video feed showing a coal mine near Kotlyne, Donetsk Oblast, on Feb 2, 2025. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Rising by the railway just outside the village of Kotlyne, this small mine, one of dozens dotting the landscape of Donetsk Oblast, represents the very frontier of Russia&#x2019;s westward advance to outflank the embattled city of Pokrovsk. Failing to make progress with a direct assault on Pokrovsk since approaching the southern outskirts of the city in September, Russian forces have turned to a time-honored tactic of trying to surround defenders with wide pushes to Pokrovsk&#x2019;s west and east. Day by day, the offensive also brings with it a grim new reality: that Russia&#x2019;s war could soon enter a new Ukrainian region. According to open-source mapping, Russian forces are now less than five kilometers from the border of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which has not so far seen fighting on the ground. The highway from Pavlohrad to Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, on Feb 2, 2025. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Though Pokrovsk is still far from being surrounded, further south, the situation is markedly more dire. In the aftermath of the fall of Kurakhove in January, elite Ukrainian brigades, though badly depleted, continued to cling on to a pocket of territory just west of the city, despite being encircled on three sides. In mid-February, the Kurakhove pocket began to collapse, and now, the question looms of whether a more evened-out front line will be what Ukraine needs to truly knock the wind out of Russia&#x2019;s offensive, if only temporarily. On the geopolitical front, the last frosty weeks of winter have brought with them chilling signs for Ukraine. But as the world&#x2019;s focus fixates on U.S. President Donald Trump and his alignment with Moscow&#x2019;s war narrative, a desperate struggle to stabilize the Donetsk Oblast front line is continuing uninterrupted. The Kyiv Independent spent two weeks in the Pokrovsk and Kurakhove sectors of the front line, speaking to infantry and artillery commanders, medics, and drone pilots. Though all spoke of heavy fighting and frequent Russian assaults, attacks were reported to have seen a relative lull in the final weeks of winter. &#x201C;When you look at the whole situation, you could say it&apos;s a small operational pause that we&apos;ve observed,&#x201D; Emil Kastehelmi, a Finnish military analyst and member of the Black Bird Group open-source intelligence collective, told the Kyiv Independent &#x201C;They have kept the contact, advancing small steps here and there, but the larger-scale offensive operations have died down.&#x201D; In a narrow treeline between fields of frost, three Ukrainian mortarmen get to work by the dim red light of head torches. Dropping 82mm shells into a weapon that hasn&#x2019;t changed much for over a century, they go about their work without seeing the result, laying fire down on the coordinates given by Babai&#x2019;s officers at the command point. The crew fires around half a dozen shells throughout the night, laying down fire on Russian infantry positions in the hope of crippling the next planned enemy assault. These mortar positions are less than two kilometers (1.2 miles) from the Russian forces digging in around Kotlyne and the coal mine. A week earlier, said mortarman Artem &#x201C;Rio,&#x201D; things were a lot hotter here. &#xA0; &#x201C;When we came in, it was a chaotic situation, it seems to have evened out,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We held on to our positions well, but the flanks were pushed back, and we were basically surrounded for a while there.&#x201D; According to commander Babai, the hectic month his unit has spent fighting here outside Pokrovsk bears all the hallmark signs of systemic organization problems in the Ukrainian military. &#x201C;When we were brought here our battalion was already not combat-effective. We had less than 30 infantrymen left,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;When we came in here, into the chaos we found ourselves in, where there was no established position, no properly constructed supply routes, we ended up in a head-on battle. Some of us were killed while disembarking near trenches that were supposed to be ours, but in reality, they were occupied by the enemy.&#x201D; Two Ukrainian mortarmen prepare shells at a firing position near Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, on Feb. 3, 2025. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Problems in communication in command are only exacerbated by the manpower crisis, asserted Babai, who has routinely had to take the painful step of transferring his own artillerymen into the infantry. &#x201C;When the high command looks at the roster and sees 400 troops in the battalion, they think it&#x2019;s a combat-effective unit,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;They don&#x2019;t actually check how many soldiers are assigned to each company or realize that there is no infantry, and send us in anyway.&#x201D; &#x201C;Our infantry ran out pretty quickly, while our flanks folded, and we had to retreat to Kotlyne.&#x201D; The general chaos recalled by Babai testifies to the critical situations that arise when positions are lost in quick succession, leaving the flanks of neighboring units exposed without their knowledge, and leaving mortarmen like Rio&#x2019;s crew in danger of being trapped in a direct firefight. Worst of all is the lot of the infantry in such conditions, forced to fight off assaults from makeshift positions, with little prospect for planned rotation. &#x201C;A soldier deploys and might sit there for a week, two weeks, a month &#x2014; until he gets wounded or until someone else returns from the hospital to replace him,&#x201D; said Babai. &#x201C;Under these conditions, with constant assaults, guys hold out for a week or two, and then we see desertion cases. These are guys who fought hard, repelled dozens of attacks &#x2014; but the assaults don&#x2019;t stop, and their minds can&#x2019;t hold up forever. Their psyche breaks.&#x201D; Ukrainian mortar battery commander Tymur &quot;Babai&quot; near Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, on Feb 2, 2025. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)With the arrival of freezing temperatures in mid-February, Russian offensives in the Kotlyne sector have died down, even allowing for successful local counterattacks. On the southern outskirts of Pokrovsk, Ukrainian troops took back the village of Pishchane, while in Babai&#x2019;s sector, Ukrainian assault battalions and special forces took back the coal mine. &#x201C;In the Pokrovsk sector, the initiative is beginning to shift to us,&#x201D; said a Ukrainian Special Forces sniper fighting in the area, who declined to be identified for security reasons. &#x201C;They are taking crazy losses; I&#x2019;ve never seen anything like it.&#x201D; If Ukraine can keep up the pressure and uses its time to reorganize its defense, Russian attacks in the area could be stopped dead in their tracks for a long time, according to Babai. &#x201C;The enemy loses morale and can no longer assault,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;They scatter, hiding not even in trenches but in basements, and they don&#x2019;t move anywhere. Their commanders don&#x2019;t know where their personnel are, while we simply finish off the remnants.&#x201D; In a grove of trees somewhere southwest of Pokrovsk, company commander Oleksandr &#x201C;Willy&#x201D; arrives with his team at dusk in an armored vehicle to begin his shift. &#x201C;I hope the day will be quiet, but maybe we could see some movement from their infantry,&#x201D; he says as he takes his place in front of the computer screen. &#x201C;They could try to crawl up to our positions in their small groups.&#x201D; This group is an infantry company of Ukraine&#x2019;s 14th National Guard Brigade, better known as Chervona Kalyna (Red Viburnum) after the subject of a famous Ukrainian folk song. Formed in 2023 as part of the Assault Guard group of new brigades fighting under the Interior Ministry, Chervona Kalyna first saw action in the 2023 Zaporizhzhia Oblast counteroffensive before being transferred to the defense of Pokrovsk in the latter half of 2024. This small dugout, divided crudely into a workspace and a flat area for sleeping, is the brain of the day-to-day positional infantry warfare that has defined this war.

(Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Next to the ubiquitous drone feeds, a neat Excel spreadsheet displays the names of the company&#x2019;s men currently out on positions. Each column of callsigns in the table represents a small, isolated group of Ukraine&#x2019;s most precious resource at this stage of the full-scale war: trained, motivated infantrymen. Even when manning organized lines of defense, Ukrainian infantry have found themselves in isolated conditions that only get more brutal with each month, as the skies get increasingly saturated with Russian drones. Every hour throughout the night, Willy and his team check in on each position, one by one. The calm, laconic replies across the radio &#x201C;450 (Ukrainian military code for everything under control), online,&#x201D; provide a testament that the night is unusually quiet. A rarity in the Pokrovsk area, the Chervona Kalyna brigade has been able to hold the same positions for many months, thanks both to favorable terrain in their sector and a well-organized, well-manned defense. According to Willy though, this hasn&#x2019;t stopped Russian forces from attempting to break their line with near-daily assaults. &#xA0; &#x201C;We try to deal with them before they make it to the position, especially with drones,&#x201D; he said, &quot;the problem is that sometimes they manage to take shelter in the basements and dig in.&#x201D; &#x201C;They are looking for weak points, and when they find them, that&apos;s when they bring in more vehicles, from motorcycles to tanks.&#x201D; Ukrainian soldiers rotating positions near Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, on Feb. 3, 2025. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Sure enough, as dawn breaks, Russian forces are spotted on the move on the outskirts of the occupied town of Hrodivka. Two old motorcycles carrying two enemy infantrymen each can be seen speeding along the last street towards the Ukrainian lines. Before reaching their destination, the soldiers can be seen hastily abandoning their steeds in the middle of the road; sure enough, a few seconds later, the bikes are struck with two small explosions, one after the other. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s our FPVs (first-person view drones) working,&#x201D; says Willy, watching the screen closely. Abandoning whatever their original mission was, the four Russian soldiers take shelter in a wrecked basement. Now, throughout the day their location will be known to Ukrainian fire and drone teams, who have the rest of the day to smoke them out. Further south, in an unassuming hut on the edge of a village, the true cost of the fierce battles in the Kurakhove sector is on full display. At a stabilization point run by Ukraine&#x2019;s 37th Marine Brigade, casualties evacuated from the fighting right in the epicenter of the Kurakhove pocket are given emergency treatment before further transportation to larger military hospitals. Just before the Kyiv Independent arrived for the medics&#x2019; night shift, a large group of wounded and dead had passed through, victims of a Russian Lancet drone strike on their vehicle. The shift continues, first with a drone team who made it out of a Russian attack on their basement with no more than concussions, then a lone, newly-mobilized infantryman who took light shrapnel damage to the arm on his very first combat mission.

(Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Ukrainian medics at a stabilization point near Kurakhove, Donetsk Oblast, on Feb. 10, 2025. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Along with the 37th Marines, the Kurakhove pocket is being defended by some of Ukraine&#x2019;s top brigades, including the 46th Airmobile and 79th Air Assault Brigades, who have fought in the area since the battle of Marinka, over 30 kilometers to the east. Despite their heroic effort, the Ukrainian high command&#x2019;s decision to hold onto semi-encircled areas like this one has come under criticism for causing unnecessary personnel loss and exacerbating the already dire manpower crisis. &#x201C;In some places, it might be worth it to stay and defend, if there are especially favorable locations,&#x201D; said Kastehelmi, &#x201C;but in many places, it seems that the Ukrainians are just holding ground for the sake of holding ground.&#x201D; &#x201C;Getting into pockets stretches the front line, and creates excess amounts of front line in a situation where the units are already depleted of manpower.&#x201D; &#x201C;At the moment, all the wounded are all either very serious or very mild,&#x201D; said senior medic Illia &#x201C;Ptakh,&#x201D; speaking in between treating the wounded. &#x201C;Either they have been hit and can&apos;t be evacuated for days, making light wounds become serious, or they managed to get out as soon as they were hit.&#x201D; With the activity of enemy drones only increasing over 2024, the evacuation of soldiers several days after being wounded &#x2014; what used to be a nightmare scenario in military medicine &#x2014; is now a grim new normality. As the red winter sun rises over the steppe, a wounded infantryman is delivered to the stabilization point. &#x201C;Shrapnel wounds on the right side of the face, including the eye&#x201D; &#x2014; the paramedic&#x2019;s call lets the medics know who and what they can expect to come through the doors. Kostiantyn &#x201C;Hostryi,&#x201D; the wounded soldier, stumbles in, the medics helping him gingerly remove his clothes. &#x201C;It&apos;s very tense,&#x201D; he says, with an impressively calm tone as the medics tend his wounds with disinfectant swabs. &#xA0; &#x201C;I was the last one standing, I hung on there for four days on my own (after being wounded). There were assaults. My group was all killed, and they couldn&apos;t get us out. They just dismantled our dugouts with FPVs.&#x201D; Ukrainian medics attend a wounded soldier at a stabilization point near Kurakhove, Donetsk Oblast, on Feb. 10, 2025. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Within half an hour, Hostryi&#x2019;s company commander arrives, asking him about the hellish situation that his soldier escaped from. &#x201C;When you were retreating, were you shouting out to the guys that were hit?&#x201D; the commander asked. &#x201C;As I ran to the other basement, I couldn&#x2019;t stay outside long, they were dropping bombs on us from drones,&#x201D; Hostryi replied. &#x201C;But yes, I shouted, and nobody called back.&#x201D; &#x201C;Good job, now get healed up,&#x201D; the commander replies after a pause, tapping Hostryi&#x2019;s arm before heading out. For Ptakh, Hostryi&#x2019;s laconic tone after such a dramatic ordeal is no surprise; all in all, while everyone is tired, morale in his unit remains resolute. &#x201C;Of course, those who have lost limbs have lost a part of themselves, it&apos;s pretty hard to come back from that,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;but the others, who just took a little shrapnel, are the most motivated people I have seen, they get patched up and off they go to fight again. &#x201C;People have motivation, their country is being taken from them. It&apos;s not a question of fighting morale, it&apos;s motivation to continue living at all.&#x201D; The arrival of spring will likely bring with it new challenges to the defense of Donetsk Oblast, as the fresh leaves offer better cover from sight for enemy infantry assault groups, and the clearer skies open the field for the widespread use of Russia&#x2019;s feared heavy glide bombs. Going forward, the result of these battles will ultimately hinge greatly on Moscow&#x2019;s ability to keep feeding men into Russian infantry assault teams, said Kastehelmi. &#x201C;With the tactics the Russians use, it&apos;s really difficult to actually attrit them to the point where their offensive would culminate at all,&#x201D; he said. A Ukrainian soldier speaks to a military chaplain in a village near Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, on Feb. 8, 2025. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Over a year after attention was first brought to the need to build strong fortifications to wage the most effective defensive war possible, the failures to build extensive, well-designed lines of defense in advance have been well-documented. Shortcomings in fortification-building &#x2014; a task usually split between military engineers and civilian contractors &#x2014; have been particularly stark in Donetsk Oblast, where Russia&#x2019;s rapid advance and the proliferation of drones mean that excavators are frequently targeted, while chaotic retreats impede Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to prepare coherent lines of defense as positions get quickly overrun. In the case of the Kurakhove area, a formidable line of Ukrainian fortifications along the Vovcha River was rendered effectively useless, facing south rather than east, from where Russia attacked. More naturally favorable terrain in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which has been well-fortified in advance, offers some hope that Russian advances could be stopped in their tracks if they enter the region, according to Kastehelmi. &#x201C;There are some better places to defend, and there are new lines to retreat to,&#x201D; he said, but the problem is that if you don&apos;t have enough people to hold the worst positions, then the defensive line is basically only as strong as its weakest spot.&#x201D; With Trump&#x2019;s willingness to get tough on Russia in serious doubt, Moscow must be ground down here on the battlefield, by the hands of Ukrainians, according to Babai. &#x201C;What we need is to establish a solid defensive line and then move in the infantry,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We have the mortars, UAVs, and strike drones &#x2014; we just need to set up a strong defense.&#x201D; &#x201C;Relying on Western partners is pointless.&#x201D; A makeshift memorial at the entrance sign to Donetsk Oblast, on Feb. 1, 2025. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Here and now, the role of the Ukrainian soldiers fighting here in shifting the global balance of power against Moscow is pivotal, but not something many of them focus on. &#x201C;I don&apos;t watch the news anymore, it&apos;s just hard,&#x201D; said Willy in the dugout, &#x201C;my duty is to care for my people, not listen to politicians.&#x201D; &#x201C;Before, when you read about the possibility of negotiations, you might think: &apos;Maybe soon I&apos;ll be on the beach with my fiance, maybe I can start thinking about raising a child.&apos; But now it&apos;s the third year of the war, I&apos;m not interested in this theater.&#x201D; Natalia Yermak contributed to reporting. Hi, this is Francis Farrell, the author of this piece. It&apos;s quite a rare thing that as a journalist spending just a day with soldiers, that you are witness to this much action. What I saw in my time with Achilles is proof of two things: first, how damn good these guys are at their jobs, and second, how damn good Russia is at throwing endless waves of humans at Ukrainian defenses. This type of cyberpunk battlefield matchup could be defining for the war in 2025. Whatever ends up happening, you can count on the fact that we will take you right there. &#xA0;Please consider supporting our reporting.	https://kyivindependent.com/as-trump-and-moscow-align-their-vision-battle-to-stabilize-donetsk-front-rests-on-a-knife-edge/	2025-02-22T09:33:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/DSCF7839.jpg
Trump announces next round of Ukraine peace talks in Riyadh on Feb. 25	U.S. President Donald Trump said a new phase of ceasefire negotiations between American and Russian delegations aimed to stop Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine would take place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Feb. 25. This meeting follows the first round of discussions held in the same city earlier in the week. No Ukrainian officials were present at the Saudi negotiations. Following the initial meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlined three main objectives both sides had agreed to pursue. These include restoring embassy staff in Washington and Moscow, creating a high-level team to facilitate Ukraine peace talks, and exploring ways to strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries. Meanwhile, Russia&#x2019;s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said that preparations are underway for a potential face-to-face meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Speaking to Russian state media, Ryabkov said such a summit could cover a broad range of global issues beyond the war in Ukraine. He emphasized the need to &quot;move toward normalizing relations&quot; and address &quot;the most acute and potentially very, very dangerous situations, of which there are many, Ukraine among them.&quot; Ryabkov claimed that plans for the summit remain in the early stages and would require &quot;the most intensive preparatory work&quot; to materialize. He added that U.S. and Russian envoys may hold another meeting within the next two weeks to prepare for further high-level discussions. President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected any potential outcome from the talks, stressing that Kyiv was not included in the discussions. European allies have also voiced concerns over being sidelined in the negotiations, raising further doubts about the legitimacy of the ongoing diplomatic efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-announces-next-round-of-ukraine-peace-talks-in-riyadh-on-feb-25/	2025-02-22T09:18:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183214747.jpg
Ukraine’s work on finalizing minerals deal to start on Feb. 24, parliament speaker says	Ukraine will start working to conclude an agreement with the U.S. for its natural resources on Feb. 24, Ruslan Stefanchuk, speaker of Ukraine&apos;s parliament, told Japanese media outlet NHK. &#xA0; The U.S. is reportedly looking to obtain an interest in 50% of Ukraine&apos;s natural resources through a joint investment fund as payback for its support for Kyiv, according to a leaked version of the deal passed along to President Volodymyr Zelensky by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. According to the NHK report published on Feb. 22, the Ukrainian government will assemble an expert team to begin working on finalizing the agreement on Monday, which also marks the third anniversary of the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &#xA0; Stefanchuk said Ukraine is ready to work with partners on the agreement but wants to &quot;receive specific security guarantees,&quot; according to the report. He also said Ukraine seeks to have &quot;constructive discussions&quot; and a summit with the U.S. Zelensky previously said Kyiv was not ready to sign the document as it did not include any security guarantees. Earlier in the day, Bloomberg reported, citing its source with knowledge of the talks, that Ukraine and the U.S. need more time to finalize the agreement for Ukraine&apos;s natural resources. According to Bloomberg, the draft agreement proposed by the U.S. President Donald Trump administration &quot;currently has some questionable elements&quot; for the Ukrainian side, without specifying them. Sky News also reported, citing its source, that the agreement &#x201C;is not yet ready to be signed&#x201D; due to a number of &quot;problematic issues,&quot; adding that Zelensky is not ready to accept the current form of the draft. However, U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said on Feb. 21 that the deal &#x201C;was going to be done&#x201D; this week, according to Sky News. &quot;Here&apos;s the bottom line, President Zelensky is going to sign that deal, and you will see that in the very short term,&quot; he said during the Conservative Political Action Conference, as quoted by Sky News. Trump said in early February that he wanted to strike a deal with Ukraine involving access to rare earth minerals in exchange for continued aid. Trump later claimed that Kyiv had &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a $500 billion resource deal. However, the latest reports come shortly after Trump accused the Ukrainian president of being &quot;a dictator without elections,&quot; saying that &quot;Zelensky better move fast or he won&#x2019;t have a country left.&quot; On Feb. 19, Trump also said he aims to &quot;resurrect&quot; talks on the agreement for Ukraine&apos;s natural resources. &quot;I think I&#x2019;m gonna resurrect that deal, you know, we&apos;ll see what happens, but I&#x2019;m gonna resurrect it, or things are gonna not make him (President Volodymyr Zelensky) too happy. And look, it&#x2019;s time for elections,&quot; Trump said, without elaborating on the consequences for Ukraine and its president if the deal is not signed.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-work-on-rare-earth-agreement-to-start-on-feb-24-parliament-speaker-says/	2025-02-22T08:03:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1496402851.jpg
NATO to reportedly extend jet fuel pipeline to Czechia, Poland in case of war with Russia	NATO plans to construct a pipeline network connecting Germany with Poland and the Czech Republic to secure a swift jet fuel supply for fighter jets in case of a war with Russia, Reuters reported on Feb. 22, citing Der Speigel. According to an internal memo from Germany&#x2019;s armed forces, Bundeswehr, cited by Der Spiegel, there are &quot;major challenges in ensuring a reliable fuel supply&quot; for troops that would need to be deployed to the eastern border in an emergency. The current pipeline system of the alliance, dating back to the Cold War, ends in western Germany, Reuters reported. There has been no official confirmation from Polish and Czech officials yet. Reuters reports that internal discussions among NATO allies have concluded that pipeline systems are &quot;the backbone of NATO&#x2019;s fuel supply,&quot; as stated in a separate briefing document for senior German defense ministry leaders. The project is estimated to cost 21 billion euros ($22 billion) and is expected to be completed by 2035. The report comes amid growing concerns in Kyiv and among European allies about Washington&apos;s shifting stance on the war, particularly after the U.S. held direct talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. Moscow allegedly demanded that the U.S. withdraw NATO forces from eastern Europe during U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia as a condition for &quot;normalizing relations,&quot; the Financial Times (FT) reported on Feb. 20, citing two officials in the region. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claimed on Feb. 21 that Russia did not ask the U.S. to withdraw the troops, while the U.S. delegation also reportedly rejected the demand. However, concerns remain over what concessions U.S. President Donald Trump might consider to secure a deal with Russia on ending its war against Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin frequently claims that NATO poses a threat to Russia, accusing the alliance of seeking to expand its borders eastward. Moscow has repeatedly used Ukraine&apos;s possible entry into NATO as one of the justifications for launching its full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-to-reportedly-extend-jet-fuel-pipeline-to-czechia-and-poland/	2025-02-22T07:06:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-996215146.jpg

Fico says Zelensky 'needs this war,' justifies Russia's full-scale invasion	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has justified the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine, saying that Russia had &quot;serious security reasons&quot; for it. &#xA0; &quot;No one is disputing that Russia&apos;s use of military force in Ukraine was a violation of international law. However, Russia had serious security reasons for doing so because it has long been misled on the issue of NATO enlargement,&quot; Fico said at the Conservative Political Action Conference in the U.S. on Feb. 21. &quot;The conflict could have been brought to an end shortly after it began,&quot; he said. &#xA0; In his 15-minute-long speech, Fico also backed U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s recent criticism of President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying that Zelensky &quot;actually needs this war&quot; to remain in power. Earlier on Feb. 21, U.S. President Donald Trump claimed Zelensky is not essential to negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. He previously also accused Zelensky of being a &quot;dictator&quot; and espoused false claims about Ukraine. &quot;When there is a war, there cannot be democratic elections... When there is a war, it is difficult to investigate where a huge part of the funding given to Ukraine ended up,&quot; said Fico. The speech comes amid intensified tensions between Fico and Zelensky. Fico, who maintains friendly ties with Russia, has escalated threats against Kyiv following the termination of Russian gas transit via Ukrainian territory on Jan. 1. In his remarks on Jan. 28, Fico called Zelensky &quot;the enemy&quot; of Slovakia. Ukraine expressed &quot;deep disappointment&quot; over Fico&apos;s statements, accusing him of acting as &quot;the Kremlin&apos;s mouthpiece&quot; while ignoring Slovakia&apos;s EU membership. The Foreign Ministry warned that this undermines relations between the two countries and damages EU unity. On Jan. 29, the Slovak Foreign Ministry summoned Ukrainian Ambassador Myroslav Kastran, delivering a &quot;strong protest&quot; against what it called Ukrainian interference in Slovakia&apos;s internal affairs. In response, Ukraine summoned Slovak Ambassador Pavel Vizdal on Jan. 30. In his speech on Feb. 21, Fico also claimed the &quot;absolute majority&quot; of the EU member states, except &#xA0;Slovakia and Hungary, have &quot;endorsed the idea that the war in Ukraine should be used to weaken Russia politically and economically.&quot; &quot;Ukraine has been a victim of a bad strategy,&quot; Fico claimed. He also accused the EU of &quot;pushing themselves to the US-Russian peace negotiating table, even though for three years now, they have and still do openly support the war in Ukraine&quot; and said that &quot;peace talks&quot; may not lead to a just and sustainable peace for Ukraine and its territorial integrity. &quot;However, Europe should, in any case, help the US president to end the senseless killings in Ukraine as quickly as possible and not hinder him from achieving this goal,&quot; Fico said.	https://kyivindependent.com/fico-says-zelensky-needs-this-war-justifies-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/	2025-02-22T04:17:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192475502.jpg
Ukraine's SBU claims attack on Russian oil pumping station in Krasnodar Krai	Drones operated by Ukraine&#x2019;s Security Service (SBU) struck a substation powering the Novovelychkovskaya oil pumping station in Russia&#x2019;s Krasnodar Krai on Feb. 20, effectively disrupting its operations, a security source told the Kyiv Independent. According to the source, the station is one of the &quot;key facilities for transporting oil in the Kuban region, supplying the Afipsky and Ilysky oil refineries.&quot; Russian authorities are currently assessing the damage, the source said. On Feb. 20, several local Russian media outlets and Telegram channels reported explosions in the Krasnodar Krai region, claiming Russian air defense repelled the drone attack and there was no fire. &quot;This is the eighth successful SBU special operation since the beginning of the year targeting Russia&apos;s oil refining and pumping facilities. Each such explosion results in multimillion-dollar losses for Russia and complicates the provision of fuel to the Russian army,&quot; the source said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Ukraine routinely launches deep strikes against military and industrial facilities in Russia, primarily relying on domestically developed drones. Kyiv has particularly taken aim at Russia&apos;s fossil fuel infrastructure as part of its strategy to undermine funding for the Kremlin&apos;s war chest. Earlier on Feb. 20, a source in Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) confirmed they were behind the detonations of goggles for first-person-view (FPV) drones used by Russian soldiers. According to the source, HUR bought a large batch of FPV goggles for the operation and rigged them with explosives and a detonation mechanism.	https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-confirms-attack-on-russian-oil-pumping-station/	2025-02-22T03:13:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/photo_2024-07-07-18_27_19.jpeg
The US wants lasting peace' — Polish FM meets State Secretary Rubio	Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski met U.S. State Secretary Marco Rubio during his trip to the U.S. on Feb. 21, saying it was a &quot;powerful conversation between close allies.&quot; Sikorski said their meeting was &quot;substantial and cordial&quot; and it &quot;confirmed the durability of the Polish-American alliance,&quot; Polish RMF FM reported. When asked about the Ukraine peace negotiation tactics of U.S. President Donald Trump, Sikorski said it was better to ask the U.S. side about them, adding he &quot;got the impression that the United States wants lasting peace.&quot; Sikorski and Rubio&apos;s meeting comes amid growing concerns in Kyiv and among European allies about Washington&apos;s shifting stance on the war, particularly after the U.S. held direct talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. Earlier on Feb. 21, U.S. President Donald Trump claimed Zelensky is not essential to negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. He previously also accused Zelensky of being a &quot;dictator&quot; and espoused false claims about Ukraine. &quot;I don&apos;t think he&apos;s very important to be at meetings, to be honest with you,&quot; Trump told Fox News Radio on Feb. 21. &quot;When Zelensky said, &apos;Oh, he wasn&apos;t invited to a meeting,&apos; I mean, it wasn&apos;t a priority because he did such a bad job in negotiating so far.&quot; According to Polish media PAP, when speaking about security guarantees for Ukraine, Sikorski said that &quot;it is about Ukraine being able to determine its own future.&quot; Sikorski also told journalists the issue of the possible presence of European soldiers in Ukraine as part of security guarantees was not raised during his meeting with Rubio. Earlier on Feb. 21, Sikorski wrote on X that he had brought the &quot;Shahed&quot; drone, shot down by Ukrainian forces, to the Conservative Political Action Conference in the U.S. &quot;The Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington is one of the most influential political events in the world. This year, visitors can see the downed drone provided by Poland, which symbolizes the death of thousands of innocent lives: the Iranian &apos;Shahed.&apos; Together, we are effectively countering the axis of evil,&quot; he wrote.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-fm-meets-state-secretary-rubio-in-us-powerful-conversation-between-close-allies/	2025-02-22T02:24:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200311778.jpg
Zelensky, Scholz discuss 'ways to achieve just peace' in Ukraine	President Volodymyr Zelensky and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz discussed &quot;ways to achieve just peace in Ukraine&quot; during a phone call on Feb. 21. According to a statement from Steffen Hebestreit, the German Federal Government spokesman, Scholz &quot;reiterated his ongoing and unwavering solidarity with Ukraine,&quot; and assured that Germany would continue to support Ukraine in close coordination with European and international partners until a &quot;just, comprehensive and lasting peace is achieved.&quot; The phone call comes amid growing concerns in Kyiv and among European allies about Washington&apos;s shifting stance on the war, particularly after the U.S. held direct talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. Earlier on Feb. 21, U.S. President Donald Trump claimed Zelensky is not essential to negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine.

Both Zelensky and Scholz agreed that Ukraine must be &quot;at the table in future negotiations on peace,&quot; that &quot;questions about European security must be discussed together with the Europeans,&quot; and that &quot;close coordination between Ukraine and its closest partners is necessary.&quot; &#xA0; Following the call, Zelensky also announced their discussion on a shared approach to ending the war and ensuring reliable security guarantees was &quot;substantive.&quot; &quot;We discussed in detail the necessary steps to achieve a just peace, as well as Europe&#x2019;s role at the negotiating table,&quot; he said in a post on Telegram. Zelensky also thanked Scholz for his support, adding that since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Germany has provided Ukraine with 43.6 billion euros in assistance. &quot;I thanked him (Scholz) for Germany&#x2019;s contribution to protecting thousands of lives, as well as for its leadership in strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s air defense,&quot; Zelensky wrote. &quot;Ukrainian people will always remember such strong support.&quot; According to a recent poll released on Feb. 21 by Ukrainian polling firm Rating, 91% of Ukrainians surveyed oppose peace negotiations between the U.S. and Russia without Ukraine&apos;s participation.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-scholz-discuss-ways-to-achieve-just-peace-in-ukraine/	2025-02-22T00:17:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/Zelensky-and-Scholz-June-11.jpeg
Europe did more than the U.S.' — EU defense commissioner pushes back against Trump accusations	Editor&apos;s note: The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. Donald Trump&apos;s return to the White House has forced Kyiv and other European capitals to ask themselves a sobering question: What will happen to Western support for Ukraine if the U.S. withdraws? The U.S. has been, by far, the largest military donor to Kyiv, delivering $67 billion in arms since 2022, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky &#x2014; a figure slightly higher than the overall defense commitments by all European countries combined. Yet in recent days, Trump has attacked Europe over its supposed lack of contributions to Ukraine, overstated Washington&apos;s support, and given a very clear signal that the continent won&#x2019;t be able to rely on the U.S. for its security in the future. If the U.S. does withdraw, questions remain over whether Europe can realistically plug the gap and pay for the defense of Ukraine and the continent as a whole. Lulled by decades of peace, Europe&apos;s defense industry has struggled to catch up with the high-attrition warfare in Ukraine, often failing on its promises to deliver arms and ammunition as fast as needed. To whip the European defense industry into shape, Brussels has appointed veteran Lithuanian politician Andrius Kubilius as its first-ever defense commissioner. The Kyiv Independent sat down with Commissioner Kubilius to ask whether the EU is ready to step up in the light of recent shifts in the U.S. Speaking on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14, Kubilius pushed back against Washington&apos;s accusations while underscoring the strides made by the European defense industry since 2022. Nevertheless, catching up with Russia&apos;s wartime arms production remains a challenge to be overcome, Kubilius warns. The Kyiv Independent: U.S. officials said earlier this week that Europe should take up greater responsibility for supporting Ukraine militarily. Do you think the EU has the capacity to become Ukraine&apos;s leading supporter if the U.S. withdraws or reduces support? Andrius Kubilius: First of all, we need to look precisely at the numbers. During three years of the (full-scale) war, EU support to Ukraine, which includes military support, budgetary support, and humanitarian support, was around 134 billion euros ($140 billion). If you calculate the same support from the United States, it&apos;s around $100 billion. So, the overall support from the European Union is 30% bigger than support from the United States. When we look at military support, yes, Americans provided around $60 billion, and European support is 48 billion euros ($50 billion). But if we are looking at the scale of support, unfortunately, both the EU and American support for Ukrainian defense per year does not reach 0.1% of GDP. We need to look at how to increase support for Ukraine because we want to achieve this formula: &quot;Peace through strength.&quot; Strength demands, from our side, bigger military support for Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent: There are reports that the Americans are considering the idea that Europe would be buying U.S. weapons for Ukraine. What do you think about this proposal? Andrius Kubilius: First of all, it would be good for us to buy much more Ukrainian production under the so-called Danish model. This would allow us to procure two times more weapons, which are needed for the Ukrainian army, with the same amount of money because the Ukrainian defense industry is very successful and becoming stronger. Secondly, we can look at what we can provide from European Union industries. Then, perhaps there are some weapons that the Europeans are not producing and which are produced by Americans, and we need to look at how those weapons can be delivered to Ukraine. I don&apos;t know if the Americans will stop providing support to Ukraine. I still hope they understand how important it is to give Ukraine additional strength. For the time being, we cannot react to what Americans are saying because we can see some different statements from different members of the administration. The Kyiv Independent: The European defense industry has been criticized during the full-scale war for not delivering enough fast enough to Ukraine. For example, 1 million artillery shells were delivered only after a significant delay. Have these deficiencies been addressed? Andrius Kubilius: Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine and our effort to support Ukraine have shown quite deep problems in the European defense readiness and defense industry. I would remind you that back in 2022, the European industry was able to produce only around 300,000 artillery shells per year. Once the promise to give 1 million shells was given, suddenly it was clear that we were not able to produce (them). That is why the first European Union-level program, the so-called ASAP program, was introduced, which created mechanisms for how we can support European industries when they are expanding their production capacities on the EU level. According to the numbers, we will end this year with the ability to produce around 2 million artillery shells per year. So we increased our production capacity by almost eight times. We are now producing more than the Americans, but still, we see the challenge that the Russians, with their war economy and with assistance from North Korea, are able to produce more. We need to continue those programs and look at how to expand our defense industry production in all different areas. In our white paper about European defense, which we are now drafting, we are trying to have a very clear understanding of what NATO capability targets European member states need to achieve very soon. I&apos;m always saying that we need to increase our defense capabilities, not incrementally but in what I call a Big Bang approach. Bundeswehr soldiers participate in the final NATO exercise &quot;Quadriga 2024&quot; in Pabrade, Lithuania, on May 29, 2024 (Kay Nietfeld / picture alliance via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: Do you have an estimate for when the European defense industry will match Russia&apos;s production? Andrius Kubilius: We have a clear understanding from different EU intelligence services that Russia could be ready to test the European Union before 2030. Some, like the Danish intelligence, are saying even by 2027. So our task is to be ready to defend the European Union in such a way as to deter Russia from any ideas about military aggression against European member states. That is why we need to move very rapidly. The Kyiv Independent: President Donald Trump said that NATO countries should increase their defense spending benchmark to 5% of GDP, which is a level that none of the NATO countries, including the U.S., reached in 2024. How realistic do you think this goal is? Andrius Kubilius: It&apos;s very clear that we need to increase our defense spending from 2%. It&apos;s a question for NATO to agree on the target. And as you correctly mentioned, when President Trump is speaking about 5%, he needs to say in a very clear way that he is ready himself to increase American defense spending, because now, their defense spending is around 3.5%. There are quite a number of European member states who are now spending around the same amount, like 3.5%. Poland is leading with perhaps 4.5%. Now, the Baltic states are announcing they are going to raise defense spending up to 5% or 6%. But those decisions are made not because Trump is demanding them, but because there is such a guy as Putin. We understand very well what can happen if we don&apos;t increase our defense readiness radically in a very short period of time. The Kyiv Independent: You mentioned that one of the main goals now is to help Ukraine negotiate from a position of strength. But it seems time may be short, as President Trump is pushing for negotiations. Do you feel there is enough momentum from the EU to really help Ukraine negotiate from a position of strength? Andrius Kubilius: As I said, the EU has been doing quite a lot with our assistance to Ukraine, because during the war, it&apos;s not only military assistance that&apos;s important &#x2014; it&apos;s also assistance to the budget to keep the financial system stable. Humanitarian assistance is also very crucial. So the Europeans have done, we can say, more than Americans. If the Americans are criticizing us (by saying) the Europeans need to do more, we accept that criticism, but we can say that the Americans could also do more. I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s the best way for us to spend time, criticizing each other on who needs to do more. In my view, we need to do more to strengthen Ukraine and have a clear plan on how we can realize that. Note from the author: Hi, this is Martin Fornusek. I hope you enjoyed this interview.

US threatens to shut off Starlink if Ukraine won't sign minerals deal, sources tell Reuters	The United States has threatened to cut off Ukraine&apos;s access to Starlink satellite internet terminals if Kyiv does not reach a deal with the U.S. regarding critical mineral resources, Reuters reported on Feb. 21, citing three sources familiar with the negotiations. U.S. and Ukrainian officials are currently negotiating the terms of a revised minerals deal after President Volodymyr Zelensky refused to sign an initial proposal. U.S. President Donald Trump said earlier on Feb. 21 that the parties are &quot;pretty close&quot; to an agreement. U.S. negotiators have warned that Ukraine would lose access to Starlink terminals, owned by billionaire Elon Musk&apos;s company SpaceX, if Kyiv did not sign the deal, sources told Reuters. Starlink internet terminals have played a crucial role in securing communications in the war in Ukraine. Last year, Ukraine said that approximately 42,000 terminals were in operation across the military, hospitals, businesses, and aid organizations. Washington first raised the prospect of shutting off Starlink service after Zelensky rejected the deal presented by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Feb. 12, sources said. The deal reportedly sought a 50% stake in Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas, without offering Ukraine any concrete security guarantees. The Starlink threat came up again in talks with U.S. Special Envoy Keith Kellogg, who met with Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials in Kyiv on Feb. 20. A source told Reuters that the loss of Starlink access would be devastating for Ukraine. &quot;Ukraine runs on Starlink. They consider it their North Star,&quot; the source said. &quot;Losing Starlink ... would be a massive blow.&quot; SpaceX began providing Starlink terminals to Ukraine shortly after the full-scale invasion, giving Kyiv a crucial communications advantage on the battlefield. Since then, however, Musk has grown increasingly vocal in criticizing Ukraine. Musk, who Trump has tasked with eliminating &quot;fraud&quot; and &quot;waste&quot; from the government budget, has called for shutting down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), an organization that provides vital humanitarian aid to Ukraine. He has also amplified Russian disinformation and mocked Zelensky for calling Ukraine an independent country. Trump also began lashing out at Zelensky after he refused to sign the minerals deal. He&apos;s questioned Zelensky&apos;s legitimacy as president and claimed he&apos;s not important to peace negotiations with Russia. Trump said in early February that he wanted to strike a deal with Ukraine involving access to rare earth minerals in exchange for continued U.S. aid. Trump later claimed that Kyiv has &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a $500 billion resource deal. The contents of the revised agreement currently under discussion have not been disclosed. Trump claimed on Feb. 21 that Ukraine was &quot;very happy&quot; with the deal and that the U.S. would &quot;get our money back.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-threatens-to-shut-off-starlink-if-ukraine-wont-sign-minerals-deal-sources-tell-reuters/	2025-02-21T21:43:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1853200567.jpg
US proposes rival UN statement on Ukraine war, clashing with Kyiv, Europe, Reuters reports	The United States has prepared its own draft of a United Nations resolution marking the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, rivaling Kyiv and European countries&apos; joint statement, Reuters reported on Feb. 21. The move comes after the U.S. reportedly refused for the first time to co-sponsor the previous draft of the UN resolution, which reaffirms Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity and condemns Moscow&apos;s aggression. The new U.S. resolution mourns the casualties of the &quot;Russia-Ukraine conflict&quot; and &quot;implores a swift end to the conflict,&quot; according to a draft obtained by Reuters. It also affirms &quot;that the principal purpose of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security and to peacefully settle disputes.&quot; The resolution &quot;further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.&quot; According to Reuters, Russia has proposed an amendment that edits the text to &quot;implores a swift end to teh conflict, including by addressing its root causes, and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.&quot; Russia&apos;s envoy to the U.N., Vasily Nebenzya, called the U.S. draft a &quot;good move.&quot; He also said the U.S. briefed him on the text before circulating it to the other members of the General Assembly. Moscow would vote in favor of the U.S. resolution if the General Assembly voted to adopt it, a Russian official told Reuters, speaking on the condition of anonymity. European diplomats reportedly held a meeting on Feb. 21 to discuss the U.S. draft. The General Assembly will vote on the resolution on Feb. 24, which marks the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In previous years, the U.S. has co-sponsored resolutions condemning Russian aggression and calling for a just peace. The upcoming UN vote is considered a key indicator of global support for Ukraine. The softened language towards Russia reflects a dramatic shift in U.S. rhetoric towards Kyiv and Moscow over the past week. U.S. President Donald Trump has lashed out at President Volodymyr Zelensky, calling him a &quot;dictator&quot; and blaming Ukraine for starting the war. Trump on Feb. 21 acknowledged that &quot;Russia attacked&quot; Ukraine, but still shifted blame to Zelensky and former U.S. President Joe Biden for not preventing the invasion. The U.S. also opposed directly calling Russia the &quot;aggressor&quot; in a G7 statement marking the anniversary of the invasion, according to the Financial Times.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-proposes-rival-un-statement-on-ukraine-war-clashing-with-kyiv-europe-reuters-reports/	2025-02-21T20:38:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1676985291.jpg
EU preparing military aid package for Kyiv worth $20.9 billion, Bloomberg reports	The European Union is preparing a military aid package for Ukraine worth approximately 20 billion euros ($20.9 billion), Bloomberg reported on Feb. 21, citing a source familiar with the matter. The latest package aims to bolster Ukraine&apos;s strategic position as U.S. President Donald Trump presses for a speedy ceasefire agreement with Russia. The additional military support would aim to supply Kyiv with air defense systems, artillery ammunition, long-range missiles, and drones, Bloomberg reported. People familiar with the plans said that the details of the discussion will be discussed at an upcoming foreign ministers meeting. EU member states and allies could offer cash contributions or military equipment to the aid package, sources told Bloomberg, speaking on the condition of anonymity. European leaders would then agree on the final value of the package and approve the aid. The package could potentially be delayed, as Hungary &#x2014;&#xA0;one of Europe&apos;s most Kremlin-friendly countries &#x2014; has promised to oppose any additional aid to Ukraine. The German elections, set for Feb. 23, could also affect the timeline. Earlier this week, Politico reported that the EU was preparing additional security assistance for Ukraine worth at least $6.2 billion. European leaders have scrambled to deliver military support to Ukraine as the U.S., under the Trump administration, races to make a deal with Moscow. When U.S. and Russian officials met in Riyadh on Feb. 18 for preliminary talks on ending the war, EU officials feared Europe was being shut out of the peace process altogether. Trump has said he wants Europe to play a greater role in supporting Ukraine&apos;s financial and defense needs, but his administration has sent mixed signals as to whether Europeans are welcome in the negotiations process.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-preparing-military-aid-package-for-kyiv-worth-20-9-billion-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-21T19:34:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2151615401.jpg
Trump admits Russia attacked Ukraine	U.S. President Donald Trump admitted on Feb. 21 that Russia launched the full-scale war by attacking Ukraine. Earlier in the week, Trump blamed Ukraine for starting the war, saying Kyiv &quot;should have never started it&quot; and instead should have &quot;made a deal.&quot; During an interview with Fox News Radio, Trump conceded that Russia, not Ukraine, was the aggressor. &quot;Russia attacked, but they shouldn&apos;t have let him attack,&quot; he said. Trump said that President Volodymyr Zelensky and former U.S. President Joe Biden should have taken steps to prevent the full-scale invasion. In the same interview, Trump claimed that Zelensky was not important to future peace negotiations. The U.S. did not invite Zelensky or any Ukrainians to participate in talks between Russian and American officials in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. In the interview, Trump claimed there was no reason to invite Zelensky &quot;because he did such a bad job in negotiating so far.&quot; Trump has used increasingly hostile rhetoric towards Zelensky in recent days, calling him a dictator and accusing him of being partly to blame for Russia&apos;s attacks. Russia launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-admits-russia-attacked-ukraine/	2025-02-21T18:48:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198715828.jpg
US 'pretty close' to minerals deal with Ukraine, Trump claims	The United States is &quot;pretty close&quot; to signing a rare earth minerals agreement with Ukraine, U.S. President Donald Trump claimed on Feb. 21. Trump&apos;s remarks come after reports that the U.S. sent Ukraine a revised version of the deal on Feb. 20 after President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected an initial proposal presented on Feb. 12. &quot;I think we&apos;re pretty close,&quot; Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Feb. 21. &quot;I think (the Ukrainians) want it. They feel good about it, and it&apos;s a significant &#x2014; it&apos;s a big deal, but they want it, and it keeps us in that country, and they&apos;re very happy about it. We get our money back.&quot; U.S. and Ukrainian officials have been reportedly working through the night to hammer out an agreement that would give Washington access to Ukraine&apos;s rare earth mineral deposits in exchange for continued military aid to Kyiv. Earlier in the day, U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz predicted that Zelensky would sign the deal &quot;in the very short term.&quot; In his evening address on Feb. 21, Zelensky said the agreement could improve relations between the U.S. and Ukraine. &quot;This is an agreement that can strengthen our relations, and the key is to work out the details to ensure its effectiveness. I look forward to the outcome &#x2014;&#xA0;a just result,&quot; he said. The latest round of negotiations follow a week of heightened tensions between Trump and Zelensky. Shortly after U.S. and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia for talks on the war without inviting Ukraine, Trump blamed Ukraine for starting the war and called Zelensky a &quot;dictator.&quot; Zelensky in turn accused Trump of succumbing to Russian disinformation. A visit from Trump&apos;s Special Envoy on Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, appeared to ease tensions somewhat. Kellogg praised Zelensky as a &quot;courageous leader&quot; and Zelensky said the meeting &quot;restores hope&quot; for U.S.-Ukraine relations. &#xA0; Trump said in early February that he wanted to strike a deal with Ukraine involving access to rare earth minerals in exchange for continued aid. Trump later claimed that Kyiv has &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a $500 billion resource deal. The initial U.S. proposal reportedly sought a 50% stake in Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas, as well as stakes in ports and other key infrastructure through a joint investment fund. Zelensky aid Kyiv was not ready to sign the document as it lacked concrete security guarantees. A former senior Ukrainian official reportedly called the proposal &quot;a colonial agreement.&quot; The U.S. has revised the deal to better align with Ukrainian law, Axios reported. The details of the revised deal have not yet been disclosed.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-pretty-close-to-minerals-deal-with-ukraine-trump-claims/	2025-02-21T18:28:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194989577.jpg
Austria offers to host Ukraine peace negotiations, ambassador says	Austria is open to hosting Ukraine peace talks, Austrian Ambassador to Ukraine Arad Benko said in an interview with RBC-Ukraine on Feb. 21. With U.S.-led peace talks to stop Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine looming, various countries have put themselves forward as potential hosts for negotiations. &quot;(Austrian) Chancellor (Karl) Nehammer emphasized that as the capital of a neutral country, Vienna is always ready to host future peace talks,&quot; Benko said in an interview with RBC-Ukraine on Feb. 21. Austria has a history of hosting opposing sides for talks. The country hosted leaders of the U.S. and Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War, Benko said. &quot;Austria, as a neutral country, has offered its good services as a host of negotiations between parties involved. It&apos;s important to point out that Austria is also a seat of 52 international organizations including 18 UN organizations,&quot; he said. Austria, a permanently neutral nation under its constitution, hosts various international agencies, including the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Ukraine and the EU must be involved in the peace talks alongside Russia and the U.S., Benko added, echoing sentiment in Europe that the U.S. should not exclude Europe and Ukraine from peace talks. Europe must participate in potential peace talks &quot;not only because we are the biggest donors but because Ukraine is a European country fighting for our values and freedom,&quot; Benko said. Nehammer previously proposed Vienna as a site of talks between Kyiv and Moscow in September 2024. The Austrian chancellor reiterated the offer in a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in December. Nehammer also became the first EU leader to visit Russian President Vladimir Putin following the full-scale invasion in February 2022. He visited Moscow in April 2022, claiming it was his duty to open &quot;humanitarian corridors&quot; as a step towards ending the war. Other countries that have volunteered to host future peace talks include Turkey, China, and Saudi Arabia. U.S. and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 for preliminary talks without the participation of Ukraine or Europe. Kyiv continues to insist that no talks about ending Russia&apos;s all-out war should be held without Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/austria-offers-to-host-ukraine-peace-negotiations-official-says/	2025-02-21T17:27:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1243178046.jpg
One person killed in drone attack on Kyiv Oblast, warehouse on fire	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A 60-year-old man was killed at a railway crossing in Kyiv Oblast, amid a Russian drone attack on the region, the Kyiv Oblast Military Administration reported. The deceased man, an employee Ukrzaliznytsia &#x2014; Ukraine&apos;s state railway company, was pronounced dead when paramedics arrived at the scene. Multiple drones targeted Kyiv Oblast in the early hours of Feb. 22 in a Russian drone attack, local authorities reported. Drone debris fell in Kyiv and a fire broke out on private property, Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said on Feb. 22. A local warehouse in Kyiv Oblast is burning as firefighting operations are underway. The windows of an educational institution and residential high-rise building have also been shattered. The full extent of the damage caused was not immediately available. Russia has increased its drone attacks on Ukraine&apos;s capital and surrounding region in recent months, regularly launching dozens of attack drones towards Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/one-dead-in-kyiv-oblast-drone-attack-warehouse-buildings-on-fire/	2025-02-21T15:27:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/kyiv.jpg
Bulgarian parliament votes against deploying troops to Ukraine	The Bulgarian parliament voted overwhelmingly in favor of a non-binding declaration on Feb. 21 that would seek to halt any deployment of military forces to Ukraine. European leaders have increased discussions of sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine in a potential peace settlement. Bulgaria backed out of signing a security deal with Ukraine in December citing potential peace talks. The Bulgarian armed forces can not conduct military actions in Ukraine outside of its alliance and international commitments, the declaration read. The declaration does not rule out Bulgarian forces participating in missions led by the United Nations (UN), EU, NATO, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). In the declaration, the Bulgarian parliament called for a lasting and just peace in Ukraine and believes peace can be achieved through negotiations that include all directly impacted parties. 166 lawmakers voted in favor of the declaration, 27 lawmakers voted against, and 11 lawmakers abstained from voting. Lawmakers from the ruling majority voiced that the purpose of the declaration was to reassure the Bulgarian public. &quot;We hope that as Bulgarians we&#x2019;ll look after our own national interest,&quot; Boyko Borissov, leader of the ruling GERB party said. Pro-Russian lawmakers voted against an amendment condemning Russian aggression. Bulgaria has provided Ukraine with a variety of aid since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, but the matter has been contentious due to significant pro-Russian sentiment in the country and opposition from President Rumen Radev. European leaders have called for peacekeeping forces to be deployed in Ukraine to enforce a potential ceasefire. The U.K. is reportedly leading a plan to have 30,000 peacekeeping troops deployed to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/bulgarian-parliament-votes-against-deploying-troops-to-ukraine/	2025-02-21T15:13:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-507854558.jpg
Ukrainian, US officials negotiated throughout the night amid minerals deal dispute, Axios reports	Ukrainian and U.S. officials were at the table overnight and into the morning discussing an &quot;improved&quot; bilateral rare earth mineral deal on Feb. 21, Axios reported. The U.S. is looking to obtain 50% of Ukraine&apos;s rare earth minerals, NBC reported on Feb. 15. Washington has signaled openness to deploy American troops to guard these resources if there is a deal with Russia to end the war, unnamed American officials said. U.S. President Donald Trump said in early February that he wanted to strike a deal with Ukraine involving access to rare earth minerals in exchange for continued aid. Trump later claimed that Kyiv has &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a $500 billion resource deal. A former Ukrainian official described the initial deal as &quot;a colonial agreement.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump slammed President Volodymyr Zelensky for failing to accept the mineral deal on Feb. 19. The White House sent Ukraine the latest version of the deal on the eve of Feb. 20, Axios reported citing a U.S. official and a source with direct knowledge. It is not immediately clear to what the terms of the new deal are. The U.S. proposed an improved agreement earlier this week and has further modified the proposal. The original deal did not offer any security guarantees to Ukraine. The deal is a &quot;make or break scenario for the Ukrainians,&quot; the U.S. official told Axios. It is now up to Zelensky to accept the new deal, both sources expressed concern the rift between Trump and Zelensky may worsen if Ukraine does not accept a deal. During his evening address on Feb. 21, Zelensky said that as negotiations are ongoing, Ukraine was looking for the deal to culminate in a &quot;just result.&quot; &quot;This is an agreement that can strengthen our relations, and the key is to work out the details to ensure its effectiveness. I look forward to the outcome,&quot; Zelensky said. U.S. officials and some Ukrainian officials are reportedly pressuring Zelensky to come to an agreement, Axios reported. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said on Feb. 21 that President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to sign a minerals deal with the U.S. &quot;in the very short term,&quot; the Guardian reported. &quot;President Zelensky is going to sign that deal, and you will see that in the very short term,&quot; Waltz said at the Conservative Political Action Conference. &quot;And that is good for Ukraine. What better could you have for Ukraine than to be in an economic partnership with the United States?&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-and-us-officials-negotiated-all-night-amid-minerals-deal-dispute-axios-reports/	2025-02-21T14:06:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GkOwkA1XwAAtUyM.jpg
91% of Ukrainians oppose peace talks without Ukraine's participation, poll finds	A total of 91% of Ukrainians surveyed oppose peace negotiations between the U.S. and Russia without Ukraine&apos;s participation, a poll released on Feb. 21 by Ukrainian polling firm Rating suggests. The poll, commissioned between Feb. 20 - 21, comes amid growing concerns in Kyiv and among European allies about Washington&apos;s shifting stance on the war, particularly after the U.S. held direct talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. Concerns in Kyiv continued to mount on Feb. 21 as U.S. President Donald Trump claimed on Feb. 21 President Volodymyr Zelensky is not essential to negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. &quot;I don&apos;t think he&apos;s very important to be at meetings, to be honest with you,&quot; Trump told Fox News Radio on Feb. 21. &quot;When Zelensky said, &apos;Oh, he wasn&apos;t invited to a meeting,&apos; I mean, it wasn&apos;t a priority because he did such a bad job in negotiating so far.&quot; Zelensky on Feb. 16 rejected the idea of peace negotiations being conducted behind Ukraine&apos;s back. Ukrainian surveyed overwhelmingly agreed with Zelensky&apos;s assertion, with only 7% of respondents in favor of Ukraine not participating in the peace talks. Trump plans to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia in the coming months, though the extent of Ukraine&apos;s involvement in those talks remains unclear. NBC News reported on Feb. 16, citing two U.S. officials, that the intention is for the U.S. to host a bilateral meeting with Russia, followed by a bilateral meeting with Ukraine, and culminating with talks together. A vast majority, 64%, of Ukrainians surveyed in the poll support Ukraine participating in direct negotiations with Russia to end the war &#x2014; with 32% of respondents opposed. As negotiations to end the war begin, a total of 81% of respondents believe that negotiations involving other countries are necessary for a realistic solution to end the war, with a further 83% believing that that Ukraine should agree to a ceasefire only if security guarantees are provided. The survey was conducted across all regions of the country, except those currently under Russian occupation, and survey 1,200 adults. The results are deemed to be accurate within 2.8 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.	https://kyivindependent.com/91-of-ukrainian-oppose-peace-talks-without-ukraines-participation-poll-shows/	2025-02-21T13:34:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1152488863.jpg
Trump's Ukraine remarks 'shocking,' echo Russian narratives, German opposition leader says	German opposition leader Friedrich Merz has criticized U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s statements about Ukraine, calling them &quot;shocking&quot; and aligned with Russian narratives, the German TV news program Tagesschau reported on Feb. 21. &quot;This is the Russian narrative; this is how Putin has presented it for years, and I&apos;m frankly shocked that Donald Trump has now apparently embraced it himself,&quot; Merz, the leading candidate for chancellor in the upcoming Feb. 23 parliamentary election, said. Trump has made multiple false claims about Ukraine in recent days, including calling President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and accusing him of refusing to hold elections. His remarks ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections under martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. On Feb. 18, Trump appeared to place responsibility for the ongoing war on President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s wartime leadership. Merz described Trump&apos;s comments as &quot;a classic substitution of the criminal for the victim.&quot; The criticism comes as tensions between Kyiv and Washington escalate following U.S.-Russia talks in Riyadh on Feb. 18. Neither Ukraine nor Europe were represented at the talks. Merz stressed that Europe must not passively seek a seat at the negotiations but rather assert its influence through diplomatic efforts. &quot;We have to agree on a common strategy very, very quickly,&quot; he said. As the chancellor candidate for Germany&apos;s conservative CDU/CSU alliance in the upcoming Feb. 23 elections, Merz has been a vocal critic of incumbent Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos;s Ukraine policy. He has repeatedly urged the government to provide Kyiv with long-range Taurus missiles and accused Scholz of being too hesitant in supporting Ukraine. Recent polls indicate the CDU/CSU is leading ahead of the elections, which were called after Scholz&apos;s ruling coalition lost its parliamentary majority due to the departure of the Free Democratic Party (FDP).	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-ukraine-remarks-shocking-echo-russian-narratives-german-opposition-leader-says/	2025-02-21T13:02:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1929925182.jpg
How Trump could help Russia achieve the original aim of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s claim that Ukraine&apos;s president is an illegitimate &quot;dictator&quot; aligns with Kremlin war objectives and puts Volodymyr Zelensky in an almost impossible situation, experts and analysts have told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;In the last few days we&#x2019;ve seen how closely Trump has aligned himself with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&#x2019;s view of Ukraine in general and Zelensky in particular,&quot; Ruth Deyermond, senior lecturer in post-Soviet security at King&apos;s College London, said. &quot;The demand for elections at a point when they obviously can&#x2019;t be held fairly is a Kremlin talking point that seems designed to give Zelensky an impossible choice &#x2014; hold elections under impossible conditions, allowing Russia to try to steal them and install a puppet, or refuse and be labeled a dictator,&quot; she added. Russia has been demanding an election in Ukraine in hopes to get rid of Zelensky, destabilize the political situation and potentially install Russian puppets in power, experts say. Trump echoed the Russian demands this week. Trump&apos;s comments stunned Ukraine and its allies, and flipped reality on its head as he labeled Zelensky as a &#x201C;dictator&#x201D; and simultaneously embraced Putin &#x2014; a dictator who has not held a single free and fair election for many years &#x2014; as a legitimate democratic leader. Speaking after U.S. officials held their first official meeting with their Russian counterparts since the start of the full-scale invasion, Trump on Feb. 18 falsely claimed that Zelensky had a 4% approval rating, adding that in order to &quot;have a seat at the table&quot; during negotiations, Ukraine should hold elections despite Russia&apos;s war. The day after, Trump went even further, saying Zelensky &quot;refuses to have elections, is very low in Ukrainian polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing (former U.S. President Joe) Biden like a fiddle.&quot; &quot;A dictator without elections, Zelensky better move fast or he is not going to have a country left,&quot; he added. Most of the elections held by Ukraine since 1991 have been recognized by domestic and international observers as free and competitive. In contrast with Ukraine, elections have been routinely rigged in Russia, genuine opposition candidates have not been allowed to run, and the Kremlin&apos;s monopoly on television ensured that only government-backed candidates have air time. In 2020, Russia held a rigged vote on constitutional amendments that eliminated limits on Putin&apos;s presidential terms, effectively making him dictator for life. More than 20 opponents of Putin have been killed or died in mysterious circumstances. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny died in prison in February 2024, with independent analysts accusing Putin of either ordering his murder or creating conditions that led to his death. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrives to meet with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the 61st Munich Security Conference on February 15, 2025 in Munich, Germany ( Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Elections in UkraineUnder the martial law act passed by Ukraine after Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, presidential, parliamentary and local elections are banned. If martial law had not been imposed, Zelensky&apos;s term would have ended on May 20, 2024. Both Russia and some of Zelensky&apos;s critics claim that he ceased to be a legitimate president on May 20. Major Ukrainian constitutional lawyers and legal experts believe the claim is false and unfounded. The Kremlin has long been pushing the narrative that, since Zelensky is allegedly illegitimate, he cannot sign any documents in peace talks. According to the Kremlin, Ukraine must hold elections, and a newly elected president should sign a peace deal. Stefan Wolff, professor of international security at the University of Birmingham, told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;elections in Ukraine before a final peace deal will be better for Russia than for Ukraine.&quot; &quot;It will offer Russia an opportunity to unleash its usual election meddling and to sow further division and instability,&quot; he said. &quot;Replacing Zelensky has been a war aim for Russia since the (first) day of the full-scale invasion in 2022, so this is also part of Putin&#x2019;s victory narrative.&quot; Bettina Renz, a professor of international security at Nottingham University, said that Trump &quot;is reiterating various longstanding Kremlin narratives about Ukraine and this is playing into the Kremlin&#x2019;s hands.&quot; &quot;Ukraine is a sovereign state and the idea that the timing of elections should be dictated by external powers as a precondition for a ceasefire or peace deal is baffling,&quot; she added. While the U.S. may not share the Kremlin&apos;s aim of installing a pro-Kremlin president in Ukraine, Trump&apos;s actions could inadvertently aid it. Deyermond argued that Trump&apos;s &quot;tantrum&quot; could be a reaction to Zelensky&apos;s reluctance to immediately sign a deal that would give the U.S. a stake in 50% of Ukraine&apos;s natural resources through a joint investment fund as payback for its support for Kyiv. Zelensky pushed back against a first version &#xA0;of the deal, suggesting he couldn&apos;t sign it as it didn&apos;t include security guarantees for Ukraine. &quot;Trump seems angry that he can&#x2019;t bully Zelensky and he&#x2019;s trying to put the blame on him for the failure to get a quick &#x2018;deal&#x2019; on peace, which he promised American voters during the election,&quot; Deyremond said. Wolff and Ryhor Nizhnikau, a Russia expert at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, also attributed Trump&apos;s comments to his personal dislike of Zelensky. This predates Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and stems from Zelensky&apos;s refusal to investigate a Ukrainian firm linked to Hunter Biden, the son of Trump&apos;s political opponent and ex-President Joe Biden, in 2019, they said. Trump&apos;s pressure on Zelensky resulted in his first impeachment. Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during while visiting the Radar MMC military plant, February 19, 2025, in Saint Petersburg, Russia (Contributor/Getty Images)What could happen if it works?If Ukraine found itself forced by U.S. pressure to hold elections, experts said Russia would almost certainly seek to destabilize the political situation within the country and install a pro-Kremlin leader. Olha Aivazovska, head of Ukrainian watchdog Opora, told the Kyiv Independent that any Russian attacks on or around an election day &quot;would lead to low voter turnout,&#x201D; which in turn would lead to &quot;weak&quot; legitimacy for the newly-elected Ukrainian government. &quot;If the ceasefire is violated at the start of the electoral process, Ukraine will lose the opportunity to properly organize these elections,&#x201D; she added. Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko said that as part of peace negotiations, Russia could demand that Ukraine legalize pro-Russian parties in the election, which would trigger a conflict with nationalist groups, destabilize the political situation and create another excuse for the Kremlin not to recognize the election. &quot;Russia&#x2019;s goal is to weaken the state and implement a Georgian-style scenario in Ukraine,&quot; Aivazovska said, referring to the country&#x2019;s Georgian Dream party, which initially positioned itself as pro-Western but has drifted into Russia&#x2019;s orbit. &quot;(In Ukraine) Russia can achieve the same through elections &#x2014; elections that Russia will control and influence, enabling it to incorporate its political groups (into Ukrainian politics),&quot; she said. &quot;This is something Russia will certainly do if the elections are not conducted in a protected manner.&quot; Russia could, in short, achieve the original aims of its full-scale invasion by political rather than military means, aided in part by the U.S. Nizhnikau stressed that &quot;the original goal of the military invasion was to orchestrate regime change in Kyiv and install a puppet government.&quot; Experts say that, contrary to the Kremlin narrative about immediate elections, Ukraine should only hold elections when there is stable peace and when the country is fully prepared. Aivazovska believes that Ukraine should prepare its election infrastructure within a 12-month period after a ceasefire deal is signed. But elections can only be held when a final peace deal is signed and implemented, she added. &quot;Demobilization and the lifting of martial law must occur at the stage of the peace agreement and its implementation,&quot; she said. &quot;Only then will martial law be lifted, and a fully-fledged, democratic, and transparent electoral process will begin.&quot; Politicians and experts the Kyiv Independent has spoken to emphasized that elections could only be held when peace is secure, and Ukraine is fully prepared. Nizhinikau said that &quot;if the elections occur before the peace deal, it will be self-defeating at the very least.&quot; &quot;It will create an illegitimate government in Ukraine because holding free and fair elections under current conditions is impossible,&quot; he said. &quot;The electoral campaign will undermine a fragile consensus and unity inside Ukraine: it rests on the war efforts against the common enemy and elections may ruin it.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/how-trump-could-help-russia-achieve-the-original-aim-of-its-full-scale-invasion/	2025-02-21T12:37:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200472517-2.jpg
Ukraine periodically loses up to 40% of gas production due to Russian attacks, Reuters reports	Ukraine will import up to 800 million cubic meters (mcm) of gas from Europe in February and March to make up for lost domestic production caused by Russian missile attacks, Reuters reported on Feb. 21, citing a senior industry source. Russian strikes have repeatedly hit Ukraine&#x2019;s gas infrastructure over the course of the war, reducing production by as much as 40% at certain periods following an attack. Ukraine&apos;s main gas production facilities are primarily located in frontline regions such as Kharkiv and neighbouring Poltava, making them vulnerable to Russian attacks. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukrainian infrastructure with missiles and drones over the course of the war, including gas storage facilities in western Ukraine as well. Before the onslaught of Russian attacks, Ukraine produced about 52 mcm of gas daily but needed 110&#x2013;140 mcm per day in winter, covering the shortfall from storage. Energy experts had previously warned that storage reserves were close to a critically low 10% of the storage capacity of around 30 billion cubic meters. Earlier this month, Ukraine&apos;s Energy Ministry Herman Halushchenko said Russian strikes had severely impacted Ukraine&apos;s domestic gas production capacity, and that the country would need to import an estimated 1 billion cubic meters of gas by the end of the year. He declined to provide figures on the severity of the impact. According to the Reuters, Ukraine needs to start pumping gas for next year&apos;s winter season in the spring, and that the country needs to accumulate about 13 billion cubic meters of gas. Naftogaz and private energy company DTEK confirmed to Reuters that Russian forces have attacked and damaged their facilities at least twice in February. At the beginning of this year, Ukraine halted its agreement with Russia to transport Russian gas to European customers using Ukraine&apos;s pipelines. The deal had expired at the end of 2024 and was not renewed by Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-loses-up-to-40-of-gas-production-due-to-russian-attacks-reuters-reports/	2025-02-21T12:24:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1228384175.jpg
Canada opposes Russia's return to G7, vows to 'stand its ground,' ambassador says	Canada, which currently chairs the Group of Seven (G7), opposes Russia&apos;s return to the format, Canadian Ambassador to Ukraine Natalka Cmoc said on Feb. 21. &quot;Canada is not ready for a change in the membership of the G7 and is standing its ground,&quot; she said at the Kyiv Security Forum&apos;s event marking three years since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Her remarks follow U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s statement on Feb. 13 that he would &quot;love&quot; to see Russia readmitted to the G7, calling its 2014 expulsion a &quot;mistake.&quot; Cmoc stressed that the G7 should strengthen support for Ukraine and increase diplomatic, financial, and economic pressure on Russia. She emphasized the need to lower the oil price ceiling, expand sanctions to new sectors, and close loopholes that allow their circumvention. Russia was expelled from the then-Group of Eight (G8) in 2014 following its illegal annexation of Crimea. Since the start of the full-scale war, G7 countries have provided Ukraine with substantial military and financial aid. The Financial Times reported that U.S. officials are opposing the use of the phrase &quot;Russian aggression&quot; in a planned G7 statement commemorating the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Traditionally, G7 leaders issue a joint declaration on Feb. 24 reaffirming support for Ukraine, but U.S. envoys have reportedly objected to language that explicitly blames Russia. Trump&apos;s statements have raised concerns in Kyiv and among European allies about Washington&apos;s shifting position on the war, particularly after the U.S. held direct talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 without Ukraine&apos;s participation. Trump has also made multiple false claims about Ukraine in recent days, including calling Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and accusing him of refusing to hold elections. His remarks ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in place since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. EU Ambassador to Ukraine Katarina Mathernova reaffirmed that Europe does not insist Ukraine hold elections under martial law, emphasizing that Ukraine&apos;s constitution regulates the matter. &quot;All the reasons that led to the introduction of martial law remain in force,&quot; she said. Kremlin propaganda has pushed the narrative that Zelensky is an illegitimate leader, falsely claiming that his first presidential term was set to end on May 20, 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/canada-opposes-russias-return-to-g7-vows-to-stand-its-ground-ambassador-says/	2025-02-21T12:08:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2158427632.jpg
The Kyiv Independent presents its first magazine — ‘The Power Within’	The Kyiv Independent has presented its first-ever magazine, &#x201C;The Power Within,&#x201D; as a record of Ukrainian resilience and life three years into Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. This special edition marks a departure from the solely digital presence that the Kyiv Independent has maintained since its foundation in November 2021. It was born from a desire to create something tangible and permanent amid the uncertainty of war. Original stories crafted specifically for this magazine capture the multifaceted reality of wartime Ukraine. &quot;We founded the Kyiv Independent just before the invasion, and for three years, we&apos;ve been a war publication, delivering breaking news and in-depth reporting online,&quot; says Olga Rudenko, editor-in-chief at the Kyiv Independent. &quot;This print edition is our way of taking a step back, of creating a permanent record of this moment in Ukrainian history &#x2013; a testament to the resilience and complexity of life here.&quot; This print edition takes readers on a journey across Ukraine, from the front lines of the Donbas to the vibrant cultural spaces of Kyiv. It profiles the bravery of those resisting occupation, the sorrow of those displaced because of Russia&#x2019;s invasion, and the enduring spirit of a nation refusing to be defined solely by war. &quot;Not only was this our first experience creating a print product, but it was also a bold challenge to craft something permanent at a time when nothing is,&quot; says Toma Istomina, deputy chief editor. &quot;As with all our work, we cared deeply about this magazine and had passionate discussions during the creative process &#x2014; like when we went through nearly 30 cover options before choosing the final one,&quot; she goes on. &quot;But we are proud of the magazine we present to you today and hope you will like it too, placing it in a special spot at home or in your office as a sign of support for Ukraine.&quot; In the cover photo, taken near occupied Bakhmut, a drone operator from the 93rd Separate Mechanized Brigade readies a heavy bomber drone &#x2014; once built for farming, now repurposed for war. About 200 kilometers north, in Kharkiv, people dance at a rave, moving to the beat of a city that refuses to fall silent despite constant Russian attacks. (The Kyiv Independent)The magazine features work by 12 Ukrainian photographers and illustrators, as well as foreign contributors. &#x201C;It was essential for us to tell our own story &#x2014; showing Ukraine through Ukrainian eyes, imagination, and creativity. Featuring Ukrainian photojournalists and illustrators, and printed in Ukraine, this magazine stands as a testament to the fact that even in wartime, we continue to create,&#x201D; says Irynka Hromotska, photo editor. The launch of the magazine comes at a critical juncture in the war, a time of heightened uncertainty. The Kyiv Independent views this project as a powerful statement of Ukrainian perseverance. &#x201C;The Power Within&#x201D; is now available to pre-order at The Kyiv Independent store, and shipping will begin in April.

Ukraine war latest: Russia wants to declare 'victory' over Ukraine on Feb. 24, Ukrainian intel claims	Key developments on Feb. 21: Russia is instructing its propagandists to declare &quot;victory&quot; in the war &quot;against Ukraine and NATO&quot; on Feb. 24, the third anniversary of its full-scale invasion, Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) claimed on Feb. 21. After Russia failed to take over Ukraine within days in 2022 and suffered several defeats in 2022, the Kremlin began to push the false claim that Russia was at war with NATO. Western partners have been providing Ukraine with weapons since the beginning of the all-out war but have never sent troops to Ukraine, fearing escalation. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported in its daily update on Feb. 21 that Moscow had lost 864,860 troops in Ukraine since February 2022, including 1,280 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to Ukraine&apos;s intelligence agency, Russia now aims to sow despair among Ukrainians, destabilize the situation in the country, and discredit Ukraine among its allies. Russian intelligence services plan to spread the narrative that &quot;Ukraine has been betrayed&quot; by the West and the U.S., HUR claimed. Russian propaganda will also keep on questioning the legitimacy of President Volodymyr Zelensky and &quot;the corrupt Ukrainian officials who steal U.S. aid.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s allies had generally ignored a propaganda narrative about Zelensky&apos;s legitimacy until U.S. President Donald Trump accused Ukraine of starting the war and appeared to echo the Kremlin&apos;s lines, dubbing Ukraine&apos;s president as a dictator. This claim ignores the fact that it is impossible to hold elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. As a result, Zelensky&apos;s term has been extended, which constitutional lawyers argue is permitted under Ukrainian law. HUR says that the Kremlin may use the recent U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia to impose its terms of peace on the world, trying to portray governments in Europe that back Kyiv as &quot;enemies of peace.&quot; No concrete decisions were announced following the meeting between American and Russian delegations, but Ukraine&apos;s exclusion sparked alarm in Kyiv and Europe. Echoing HUR&apos;s warnings, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) pointed to mounting cases of Russia&apos;s informational and psychological operations aimed against Ukraine. Using bot farms and fake social media accounts, Russian intelligence services aim to divide Ukrainian society and call for public order disruptions, the SBU said. U.S. President Donald Trump claimed on Feb. 21 that President Volodymyr Zelensky is not essential to negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. &quot;I don&apos;t think he&apos;s very important to be at meetings, to be honest with you,&quot; Trump told Fox News Radio on Feb. 21. &quot;When Zelensky said, &apos;Oh, he wasn&apos;t invited to a meeting,&apos; I mean, it wasn&apos;t a priority because he did such a bad job in negotiating so far.&quot; Trump&apos;s remarks come amid growing concerns in Kyiv and among European allies about Washington&apos;s shifting stance on the war, particularly after the U.S. held direct talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. Zelensky on Feb. 16 rejected the idea of peace negotiations being conducted behind Ukraine&apos;s back. Trump has also made multiple false claims about Ukraine in recent days, including calling Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and accusing him of refusing to hold elections. His remarks ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said on Feb. 15 that Europe will not be directly involved in negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, but its interests will be considered. Trump said on Feb. 20 that Russia &quot;holds the cards&quot; in any peace talks due to its control over a significant portion of Ukrainian territory. He further announced plans to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia, though the extent of Ukraine&apos;s involvement in those talks remains unclear. Moscow has positioned the U.S. as its &quot;main counterpart&quot; in negotiations, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 13. On Feb. 18, Trump appeared to place responsibility for the ongoing war on President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s wartime leadership. U.S. Vice President JD Vance also criticized Zelensky on Feb. 19, calling his public remarks about Trump &quot;counterproductive&quot; after the Ukrainian president dismissed Trump&apos;s claim that his support in Ukraine had fallen to 4%, labeling it Russian disinformation. A Feb. 19 poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) showed that 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky, marking a five-point increase since December. There is no appetite for another assistance bill for Ukraine, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said in an interview with Newsmax on Feb. 20 amid growing tensions between Washington and Kyiv. U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed to mediate a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia while using increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Kyiv. After accusing Ukraine of starting the war, Trump dubbed President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator without elections.&quot; &quot;We have to bring (the war) to an end. And I can tell you that our European allies understand the necessity as well. It&apos;s (dragged) on too long,&quot; Johnson said. Johnson, a Republican and staunch Trump supporter, has served as the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives since October 2023. He delayed aid to Kyiv for six months by refusing to hold a vote on various iterations of a $61 billion foreign assistance bill but eventually reached a deal to pass the legislation in April 2024. The speaker voiced support for the U.S. president, saying he is &quot;the brute force&quot; that can end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Trump&apos;s plan to end the war remains unclear. His special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, said the war could end this year, pledging to &quot;engage all parties&quot; within 180 days to achieve this. American and Russian delegations met in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. No concrete decisions were announced following the talks, but Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the meeting sparked alarm in Kyiv and Europe. Unofficial U.S. and Russian representatives have also reportedly been quietly meeting in Switzerland in recent months for informal discussions regarding Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, lauded on Feb. 21 &quot;positive discussions&quot; he held with President Volodymyr Zelensky a day earlier. &quot;A long and intense day with the senior leadership of Ukraine,&quot; Kellogg said on X after his meetings with Zelensky and top Ukrainian officials in Kyiv this week. &quot;Extensive and positive discussions with (President Volodymyr Zelensky), the embattled and courageous leader of a nation at war, and his talented national security team.&quot; Kellogg&apos;s appraisal of Zelensky stands in stark contrast to recent statements from the White House. Earlier this week, Trump has denounced the Ukrainian president as a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; who is doing a &quot;terrible job.&quot; Trump&apos;s aides have linked his displeasure to Kyiv&apos;s reluctance to sign the U.S.-proposed deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources and to Zelensky&apos;s statement that the U.S. president lives in a &quot;disinformation space&quot; after refuting some of his false claims. Zelensky and Kellogg held a bilateral meeting on Feb. 20. Even though the expected joint press conference was canceled at Washington&apos;s request, the Ukrainian president said the meeting &quot;restored hope.&quot; &quot;And we need strong agreements with America &#x2014; agreements that will really work,&quot; Zelensky added. Axios reported on Feb. 20 that after Ukraine refused to sign the natural resource agreement due to a lack of security guarantees, the Trump administration presented an &quot;improved&quot; draft that was likely to be accepted by the Ukrainian side. Russia may be willing to use a portion of its $300 billion in frozen assets to help rebuild Ukraine as part of a potential peace deal but insist that some of the funds be allocated to occupied territories, Reuters reported on Feb. 21, citing sources familiar with the matter. The discussions reportedly come amid negotiations between U.S. and Russian officials following their Feb. 18 meeting in Saudi Arabia. It is unclear whether the frozen assets were discussed during the talks. According to Reuters, one of the sources said Russia could agree to allocate up to two-thirds of frozen assets for Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction, provided accountability guarantees. The remaining funds, Moscow reportedly insists, would go toward rebuilding Russian-occupied territories in eastern Ukraine, which the Kremlin claims as part of Russia. Another source noted that, while Moscow appears open to using the frozen assets, the distribution of funds and the allocation of reconstruction contracts remain key points of contention. A separate Kremlin-linked source, not directly involved in negotiations, said Russia still demands a gradual easing of sanctions and the full release of its frozen assets. Following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, over $300 billion in Russian central bank reserves were frozen, with most &#x2014; 191 billion euros ($198 billion) &#x2014; held in Belgium&apos;s Euroclear depository. The G7 has previously announced that these funds will remain frozen until Russia pays for the destruction it has caused in Ukraine. The EU has already begun leveraging proceeds from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine. In January, Ukraine received 3 billion euros ($3.09 billion) as part of the EU&apos;s Ukraine Facility, funded through interest earned on the frozen reserves. The U.S. and G7 partners have pledged nearly $50 billion in loans to Ukraine, backed by revenue from Russian assets. Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the illegal annexation of Ukraine&apos;s Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kherson oblasts on Sept. 30, 2022. Moscow&apos;s latest position signals a potential shift in its approach to post-war financial settlements but underscores its continued insistence on legitimizing its occupation of Ukrainian territories. Ukraine&apos;s Defense Procurement Agency is launching a new supply model for delivering drones to the front line within weeks rather than months, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Feb. 20. Kyiv has ramped up domestic drone production over the past year. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks throughout the full-scale with Russia. According to the new model, military units will be able to choose the unmanned systems best suited to their needs. The system also aims to support manufacturers through advance orders, allowing them to plan for scaling up their production. The model aims to boost transparency in procurement as it establishes clear supply mechanisms and stimulates competition. The structure is based on the DOT-Chain, an IT system already used by the State Rear Operator (DOT), an agency dealing with non-lethal procurement for the military. DOT-Chain is designed to streamline and digitize procurement processes while reducing delivery time. &quot;Together with manufacturers, we are working to ensure that no soldier waits for weeks or months for what they need,&quot; Umerov said after a meeting with representatives of 200 drone manufacturers.

Putin orders ministers to prepare for Western companies' return to Russia	Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed his Cabinet of Ministers on Feb. 21 to prepare for the return of Western companies, saying Russian firms should have &quot;certain advantages&quot; over those re-entering the market. &quot;We can adjust accordingly the return to our market of those who want to return,&quot; Putin said during a speech at the Future Technologies Forum plenary session, suggesting potential restrictions or conditions for Western firms looking to resume operations in Russia. &quot;External problems, sanctions, with all the challenges and difficulties for us, have played an important stimulating role,&quot; &#xA0;he added. The comments come amid a rapprochement between Russia and the U.S. A Russian delegation led by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met on Feb. 18 with a U.S. delegation led by State Secretary Marco Rubio, marking the highest-level meeting between the two sides since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. and Russia agreed to start the process on Ukrainian settlement, appoint ambassadors to each other, lift &quot;obstacles to diplomatic missions&quot; and create conditions for starting U.S.-Russian cooperation, according to Lavrov. Russia is also offering the Trump administration a deal on Russian natural resources and access to the Arctic, The Moscow Times reported on Feb. 18, citing Kirill Dmitriev, one of the Russian delegates in recent Saudi Arabia talks. Following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, hundreds of Western companies exited the Russian market, unwilling to contribute to the country&apos;s economy or war effort. According to the Kyiv School of Economics Institute, 472 foreign firms have fully withdrawn, while another 1,360 have scaled back their operations. The Kremlin imposed strict exit requirements, including approval from a government commission, a mandatory 50% discount on asset sales, and an &quot;exit tax&quot; of at least 10%. Russian authorities have also seized assets from subsidiaries of Western companies that remained operational. Moscow&apos;s measures have been widely seen as retaliation for Western sanctions, including the freezing of around $300 billion in Russian central bank assets. Despite these efforts, many foreign companies have either found ways to continue business in Russia or have re-entered the market after a temporary pause.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-orders-ministers-to-prepare-for-western-companies-return-to-russia/	2025-02-21T11:17:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1259097881.jpg
Zelensky is not 'important' to negotiations on ending war, Trump says	U.S. President Donald Trump claimed on Feb. 21 President Volodymyr Zelensky is not essential to negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. &quot;I don&apos;t think he&apos;s very important to be at meetings, to be honest with you,&quot; Trump told Fox News Radio on Feb. 21. &quot;When Zelensky said, &apos;Oh, he wasn&apos;t invited to a meeting,&apos; I mean, it wasn&apos;t a priority because he did such a bad job in negotiating so far.&quot; Trump&apos;s remarks come amid growing concerns in Kyiv and among European allies about Washington&apos;s shifting stance on the war, particularly after the U.S. held direct talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18.

Zelensky to sign US minerals deal soon, Waltz says	U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said on Feb. 21 that President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to sign a minerals deal with the U.S. &quot;in the very short term,&quot; the Guardian reported. &quot;President Zelensky is going to sign that deal, and you will see that in the very short term,&quot; Waltz said at the Conservative Political Action Conference. &quot;And that is good for Ukraine. What better could you have for Ukraine than to be in an economic partnership with the United States?&quot; Waltz also predicted that U.S. President Donald Trump would be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to negotiate an end to Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. His comments follow reports that the Trump administration has presented Kyiv with a revised version of a minerals agreement after Zelensky rejected an initial proposal. Axios reported on Feb. 20 that U.S. officials made changes to align the deal with Ukrainian law, while some of Zelensky&apos;s aides have encouraged him to sign it to avoid further tension with Washington. Following his meeting with Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, on Feb. 21, Zelensky signaled Kyiv&apos;s openness to a &quot;strong, beneficial agreement&quot; with the U.S. on investments and security. The initial U.S. proposal reportedly sought a 50% stake in Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas, as well as stakes in ports and other key infrastructure through a joint investment fund. The document was delivered to Zelensky during U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent&apos;s visit to Kyiv last week. Ukraine&apos;s leader previously said Kyiv was not ready to sign the document as it lacked concrete security guarantees. The issue has become a key sticking point in U.S.-Ukraine relations, as Trump has linked future aid to trade deals with Ukraine. Trump has made multiple controversial statements about Ukraine in recent days, including calling Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and falsely claiming that he refuses to hold elections. His remarks ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. U.S. Vice President JD Vance also criticized Zelensky on Feb. 19, calling his remarks about Trump &quot;counterproductive&quot; after the Ukrainian president dismissed Trump&apos;s claim that his support among Ukrainians had fallen to 4%, labeling it Russian disinformation. A Feb. 19 poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) showed that 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky, a five-point increase since December.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-sign-us-minerals-deal-in-very-short-term-waltz-says/	2025-02-21T09:07:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2162467139.jpg
After 3 years of war in Ukraine, sometimes I think: Stop the planet, I want to get off	I bet you woke up this morning, read the world news, and couldn&#x2019;t believe it &#x2014; how is this really happening? Has the world truly plunged into total chaos and madness? You just want to wake up from this nightmare, but instead, it keeps insisting on becoming the new normal &#x2014; your everyday reality. This is exactly how Ukrainians felt three years ago &#x2014; only multiplied by the horrors of war &#x2014; when Russia launched its criminal full-scale invasion and began bombing our peaceful cities. It made us want to scream: Stop the planet, I want to get off! Over these three years of full-scale war, we Ukrainians have gone through several stages in our relationship with reality. At first, there was complete rejection and denial &#x2014; it seemed impossible to believe that a war was not only a crime but utter madness, something that had no place in the 21st century. It felt like all we had to do was take millions of photos of the war, flood social media with stories and reels, translate our messages into every language, and the world would wake up, see the truth &#x2014; and within weeks, this nightmare would be over. Righteous anger and fury soon took over, driving the Ukrainian army to carry out brilliant military operations, expelling the occupiers from our land with unimaginable effort. By the end of 2022, there was a sense of euphoria &#x2014; of mutual support within the country and solidarity from the Western world. It felt like people of goodwill, standing for moral and just principles, could achieve anything together. By 2023, the war had become our daily reality, just a part of life. Anger turned into powerless hatred, and fear lost its sting &#x2014; we had grown used to it. When the Kremlin tried to scare us with nuclear strikes, we simply laughed in response. Because what else can an ordinary person do when faced with the most terrifying bomb? Ukrainians instantly came up with a meme about Shchekavytsia, a historic hill in the center of Kyiv. The joke went that if a nuclear strike were to wipe us all out in a millisecond, we would first gather on Shchekavytsia for a joyful, carefree, ancient Greek-style orgy. The tyrant wouldn&#x2019;t scare us &#x2014; if we were to die, we&#x2019;d do so with dignity, laughing, and with our heads held high. Almost immediately, one of the most popular T-shirts in Ukraine became the one with the slogan: &quot;I&#x2019;ll be the first on Shchekavytsia.&quot; By the third year of war, there was no energy left for anger, hatred, or even laughter. It turned out that fear, like hatred, is an incredibly draining emotion &#x2014; one simply cannot live with it for too long. A sense of emptiness set in, exhaustion, an acceptance of reality as fate&#x2014;something inescapable. Whatever strength remained was directed toward the daily struggle for existence &#x2014; often without light or heat in our homes, and most importantly, without hope that this would ever end. What can be said today, as the fourth year of this bloody invasion and assault on the world order begins? We have regressed from dreaming of victory over the aggressor to the humiliating hope for an unjust peace. In practice, this means that the idea of reclaiming the 1991 borders is no longer popular in Ukrainian society. No one seriously talks about territories anymore &#x2014; the only thing that matters is ending the war, stopping our people from dying on the front lines and in the rear. Even the word &quot;victory&quot; has become almost taboo. In the past, every birthday toast ended with wishes for a swift victory; every good deed was described on Facebook as &quot;our contribution to the common victory.&quot; Now, speaking like this feels embarrassing. Such lofty words might still belong in the trenches, spoken by soldiers-turned-heroes &#x2014; but there are fewer and fewer of them every day. On the home front, that kind of rhetoric sounds cheap and hollow. Now, we hear talks of a potential peace agreement, but it&#x2019;s already clear that no matter how it plays out, for Ukraine, it will be humiliating &#x2014; some outcomes worse than others, but none truly just. A peace deal may at least temporarily stop the bloodshed, but it won&#x2019;t restore the most important thing. And I&#x2019;m not talking about lost territory &#x2014; I&#x2019;m talking about justice. What kind of world will we wake up to after this so-called peace? Not just a world where a stronger country has bitten off 20% of a weaker one. We are about to start living in a world where a war criminal orders the execution of unarmed prisoners of war kneeling before their killers and then proudly spreads footage of the massacre through his own propaganda channels. A world where people are beheaded or bludgeoned to death with sledgehammers, where children&#x2019;s oncology hospitals are bombed, where power stations are destroyed in the dead of winter to freeze millions of civilians to death, where a drone packed with explosives is deliberately aimed at the sarcophagus of a nuclear power plant during the most critical security conference. And no one is held accountable for any of it. Ukrainian soldiers rest alongside a T-72 tank in Sumy Oblast, Ukraine, on Aug. 12, 2024.

(Photo by Roman Pilipey / AFP via Getty Images)Yes, the disgust you feel reading these lines is absolutely justified &#x2014; and to Ukrainians, it has long been familiar. From now on, this feeling will slowly become a part of your daily life, too. Because even a so-called peace agreement &#x2014; however humiliating &#x2014; will not deliver what matters most: the punishment of war criminals and the condemnation of their atrocities. Instead of facing prison or isolation, the aggressor will take a seat at prestigious international gatherings, dictating his own terms. A murderer whose crimes have been captured on camera millions of times in the most documented war in human history will not stand trial but will instead laugh in our faces. And it makes you want to scream: This cannot be! This is exactly what we felt three years ago, in February 2022. We wanted to shake the world awake, to scream until someone listened. The West sympathized with us, helped us, but refused to acknowledge the truth: this war was against them, too. Today, that terrifying realization is finally dawning on Europeans, as it becomes clear to all that if war comes, America will not fight for Europe, and NATO no longer works. Tragically, it wasn&#x2019;t Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s crimes or Ukraine&#x2019;s warnings that woke Europe up &#x2014; it was Donald Trump. This geopolitical shift &#x2014; what is, in reality, America&#x2019;s betrayal &#x2014; has forced Europe to face a conclusion that was already obvious three years ago. The reason for the global chaos we now see &#x2014; where Trump openly speaks about occupying Greenland and makes it clear that Europe is no longer under America&#x2019;s security umbrella &#x2014; is painfully simple. It is the unpunished evil of Putin&#x2019;s aggression against Ukraine. That is what ultimately shattered the world order and erased all rules. It was this cynical and successful assault on global stability that led to the absurd reality where the International Criminal Court, which issued an arrest warrant for Putin, is now facing sanctions from what was once the leading democratic nation in the world. This is now a world of mockery, humiliation, and the brazen trampling of not just political norms but the moral and ethical values that define Europe itself. The evil genie has been let out of the bottle, and with each passing day, it grows stronger, bolder, more aggressive. Does anyone still doubt that if it is not stopped, not punished, it will attack again after some so-called peace agreement? And next time, it likely won&#x2019;t be just Ukraine. So forgive me, but after four years of war, my message to you from Ukraine may not be to your liking. We, Ukrainians, are glad that you are finally beginning to realize the truth: this war is against all of us &#x2014; including you. And the criminal does not even bother to hide his bloodstained teeth. Yes, it is good &#x2014; though tragically late &#x2014; that after 1,100 days of war, from Kyiv to Brussels, there is finally a shared understanding: we are all aboard the same Titanic. A ship that will never reach America &#x2014; because America is far away, and our disaster is here. We, Ukrainians, clenched our teeth long ago and did what needed to be done to survive this Titanic. Now, it will be interesting to see what choice you make: will you search for a lifeboat together with us &#x2014; or will you continue to sink helplessly beneath the waves to the sentimental strains of &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;? Editor&#x2019;s Note: The opinions expressed in the op-ed section are those of the authors and do not purport to reflect the views of the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/after-3-years-of-war-in-ukraine-sometimes-i-think-stop-the-planet-i-want-to-get-off/	2025-02-21T08:39:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2175223756.jpg
Why Ukraine can’t hold elections during wartime	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This op-ed was first published by the Ukrainian NGO Civil Network OPORA as an open statement, which garnered nearly 300 signatures at the time it was published by the Kyiv Independent. Democracy during wartime must be protected even more than in peacetime, as the consequences of mistakes or a loss of trust are far too high. Our partners and allies must ensure that elections in Ukraine result in a genuine expression of the nation&apos;s will. International standards for peaceful and post-conflict elections are the same, and there is no measure of democracy other than the true access of citizens to govern their state through their representatives, legally elected in free, fair elections by secret ballot &#x2014; without intimidation or threats. Russia&#x2019;s unprovoked aggression against a sovereign state makes holding presidential and parliamentary elections in Ukraine impossible. Russia is not a democracy: there is no real opposition, independent media, or political pluralism. In contrast, there is strong consensus in Ukraine on the need for elections no earlier than six months after martial law ends, supported by the government, opposition, and society. The legitimacy of Ukraine&#x2019;s government is an exclusive prerogative of the Ukrainian people. Any peace process must account for Ukraine&apos;s voice and include a logical sequence of democratic steps for elections. First, a sustainable ceasefire with security guarantees from allied countries. Second, the proper preparation for elections and restoration of relevant infrastructure. And third, holding elections after sustainable peace is achieved, martial law is lifted, and the war is settled internationally. Holding elections within the next six months is not aligned with security realities, the political and economic situation, or public sentiment in Ukraine. As of February 2024, 69% of Ukrainians believed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky should remain in office until the end of martial law without holding elections. This reflects unity in society and respect for the military, which is currently defending Ukraine and cannot fully participate in the political process. From the perspective of Ukraine&apos;s Constitution and legislation, holding elections during martial law is prohibited, and the authorities continue to exercise their powers legitimately.

(Jose Colon / Anadolu via Getty Images)A significant challenge to holding elections in Ukraine without sustainable peace is the lack of legal mechanisms for organizing them and ensuring voter participation. These mechanisms must account for the consequences of Russian aggression. In addition to creating the necessary legal framework for post-war elections, Ukraine must ensure millions of citizens, including those who have fled abroad, internally displaced people, and military personnel, can vote. To properly hold elections, democratic conditions must be established, including the free activity of the media, political parties, and civil society organizations, as well as parliamentary consensus on election rules. This requires additional time to transition from martial law to the election period. Elections are not only about expressing political will &#x2014; they involve preparation and organization. Equally important are tasks critical in a post-war environment: election commissions, secure voting facilities, cyber-attack-proof information systems, and ensuring transparency and security. The unstable security situation, threats of shelling, terrorist acts, sabotage, landmines, and unexploded ordnance present substantial obstacles at every stage of the electoral process. From ballot delivery to proper election observation, free campaigning, and potential voter turnout due to security threats, the principles of equal and universal suffrage could be jeopardized. Holding elections where candidates and voters face missile and drone threats violates human rights principles. The greatest challenge to electoral democracy in Ukraine is interference from Russia, which will use any means possible: from cyberattacks to direct voter bribery, spreading disinformation to dividing society, and discrediting candidates deemed unacceptable by Russian authorities. Ukraine &#x2014; both its government and society &#x2014; must prepare for such interference to protect its sovereignty, democracy, and freedom, which are being defended on the battlefield. This preparation requires sufficient time, an independent risk audit, and a strengthened mechanism to counter illegal election interference. Elections in Ukraine must take place, but only after the war ends, sustainable peace is achieved, and conditions are set to ensure free, fair, democratic, and accessible elections. Ukraine has never refused to hold elections, but organizing them requires time, resources, and careful planning &#x2014; not demands. We sincerely urge the leaders of the free world to prioritize guaranteeing security for Ukraine and preparing for the first post-war elections. This will ensure they are held as soon as possible and in line with international standards.

Russia may offer frozen assets for Ukraine's reconstruction, demand funds for occupied territories, Reuters reports	Russia may be willing to use a portion of its $300 billion in frozen assets to help rebuild Ukraine as part of a potential peace deal but insist that some of the funds be allocated to occupied territories, Reuters reported on Feb. 21, citing sources familiar with the matter. The discussions reportedly come amid negotiations between U.S. and Russian officials following their Feb. 18 meeting in Saudi Arabia. It is unclear whether the frozen assets were discussed during the talks. According to Reuters, one of the sources said Russia could agree to allocate up to two-thirds of frozen assets for Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction, provided accountability guarantees. The remaining funds, Moscow reportedly insists, would go toward rebuilding Russian-occupied territories in eastern Ukraine, which the Kremlin claims as part of Russia. Another source noted that, while Moscow appears open to using the frozen assets, the distribution of funds and the allocation of reconstruction contracts remain key points of contention. A separate Kremlin-linked source, not directly involved in negotiations, said Russia still demands a gradual easing of sanctions and the full release of its frozen assets. Following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, over $300 billion in Russian central bank reserves were frozen, with most &#x2014; 191 billion euros ($198 billion) &#x2014; held in Belgium&apos;s Euroclear depository. The G7 has previously announced that these funds will remain frozen until Russia pays for the destruction it has caused in Ukraine. The EU has already begun leveraging proceeds from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine. In January, Ukraine received 3 billion euros ($3.09 billion) as part of the EU&apos;s Ukraine Facility, funded through interest earned on the frozen reserves. The U.S. and G7 partners have pledged nearly $50 billion in loans to Ukraine, backed by revenue from Russian assets. Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the illegal annexation of Ukraine&apos;s Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kherson oblasts on Sept. 30, 2022. Moscow&apos;s latest position signals a potential shift in its approach to post-war financial settlements but underscores its continued insistence on legitimizing its occupation of Ukrainian territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-may-offer-frozen-assets-for-ukraines-reconstruction-demands-funds-for-occupied-territories-reuters-reports/	2025-02-21T08:08:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1496360455-2.jpg
With coal miners fighting to keep Ukraine's lights on	A decade ago, Ukraine&#x2019;s Donbas region was known for its thriving heavy industry and coal mining. Today, most of the region&apos;s mines are closed due to the destruction caused by Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, which has brought global attention to this area. The Kyiv Independent team visited one of the last remaining operating mines in the region to highlight the resilience of the workers who continue their work despite danger and tough conditions.	https://kyivindependent.com/with-coal-miners-fighting-to-keep-ukraines-lights-on/	2025-02-21T08:07:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/telegram-cloud-document-2-5316643267285116352.jpg
Lawmaker from Zelensky's party resigns after corruption charges, MP says	Iryna Kormyshkina, a member of parliament from President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Servant of the People party, has submitted a resignation letter amid a corruption investigation against her, Oleksii Honcharenko, an MP from the European Solidarity party, said on Feb. 21. Kormyshkina was charged by Ukraine&apos;s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) on Oct. 17 with illicit enrichment worth more than Hr 20 million ($480,000). In early January 2025, the NABU filed an additional charge against her for allegedly falsifying data in her electronic asset declaration. According to Honcharenko, parliament&apos;s rules committee will now review her resignation request before parliament holds a vote on the matter. Ukraine&apos;s asset declaration system was initially introduced as part of anti-corruption reforms following the 2013-2014 EuroMaidan Revolution. The requirement was suspended after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion but reinstated in October 2023, when Zelensky signed a law restoring mandatory declarations and making them publicly accessible. Ukraine&apos;s National Agency for Corruption Prevention (NACP) re-opened public access to the asset declaration system in December 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelenskys-party-lawmaker-kormyshkina-resigns-after-corruption-charges-mp-says/	2025-02-21T06:57:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167201231.jpg
Most Danes back sending peacekeepers to Ukraine, poll shows	Around 53% of Danes are in favor of sending peacekeepers to Ukraine after Russia&apos;s full-scale war ends, according to a poll published by Ritzau news agency on Feb. 21, Bloomberg reported. The news comes amid growing Western deliberations over stationing peacekeeping forces in Ukraine if negotiations with Russia lead to a ceasefire. The U.S. has ruled out sending its own troops while encouraging European allies to take the lead in securing Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability. The Danish poll showed that around 15% of Danes are against sending peacekeepers, while 32% are undecided or have no opinion. The survey, conducted by Voxmeter research agency, included 1,021 interviews between Feb. 18 and 20. U.K. Prime Minister Starmer is heading to Washington next week to present U.S. President Donald Trump with a plan to station 30,000 European peacekeepers in Ukraine after a ceasefire, provided they are backed by U.S. firepower, the Telegraph reported. While the U.K. and France have backed the deployment of peacekeepers, other countries remain cautious about sending their troops to Ukraine, citing concerns over the escalation and limited military resources. Denmark has provided Ukraine with about $7.5 billion worth of military aid since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. It was also the first country to offer military aid to Ukraine through direct purchases from Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industry.	https://kyivindependent.com/most-danes-back-sending-peacekeepers-to-ukraine-poll-shows/	2025-02-21T06:29:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199052386--1-.jpg
Trump's envoy Kellogg praises Zelensky as 'courageous leader' after talks	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, lauded on Feb. 21 &quot;positive discussions&quot; he held with President Volodymyr Zelensky a day earlier. &quot;A long and intense day with the senior leadership of Ukraine,&quot; Kellogg said on X after his meetings with Zelensky and top Ukrainian officials in Kyiv earlier this week. &quot;Extensive and positive discussions with (President Volodymyr Zelensky), the embattled and courageous leader of a nation at war, and his talented national security team.&quot; Kellogg&apos;s appraisal of Zelensky stands in stark contrast to recent statements from the White House. Earlier this week, Trump has denounced the Ukrainian president as a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; who is doing a &quot;terrible job.&quot; Trump&apos;s aides have linked his displeasure to Kyiv&apos;s reluctance to sign the U.S.-proposed deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources and to Zelensky&apos;s statement that the U.S. president lives in a &quot;disinformation space&quot; after refuting some of his false claims. Zelensky and Kellogg held a bilateral meeting on Feb. 20. Even though the expected joint press conference was canceled at Washington&apos;s request, the Ukrainian president said the meeting &quot;restored hope.&quot; &quot;And we need strong agreements with America &#x2014; agreements that will really work,&quot; Zelensky added. Axios reported on Feb. 20 that after Ukraine refused to sign the natural resource agreement due to a lack of security guarantees, the Trump administration presented an &quot;improved&quot; draft more that was likely to be accepted by the Ukrainian side.	https://kyivindependent.com/kellogg-praises-zelensky-as-courageous-leader-after-talks/	2025-02-21T06:05:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200011457.jpg
5.2 million Ukrainian refugees remain abroad, less than half plan to return, poll says	The share of Ukrainian refugees planning to return home has fallen to 43% by the end of 2024, compared to 74% in December 2022, according to a study by Ukrainian think tank the Center for Economic Strategy (CES) published on Feb. 21. Around 5.2 million Ukrainian refugees remain abroad, according to the report. The mass exodus peaked in March 2022, when 2.5 million people fled Ukraine in a matter of weeks following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The outflow has since slowed, with about 300,000 people leaving Ukraine last year. Most refugees come from Ukraine&apos;s northern and eastern regions, with Kyiv accounting for 18% of those surveyed, followed by Kharkiv (13.8%) and Donetsk (9.5%) oblasts, the study found. The CES projects that between 1.7 and 2.7 million Ukrainians may permanently remain abroad, potentially reducing Ukraine&apos;s annual GDP by 5.1% to 7.8%. &quot;A decrease in those willing to come back home may indicate that some refugees who initially planned to return in early 2024 have already done so,&quot; said Dariia Mykhailyshyna, co-author of the study and senior economist at CES. &quot;Yet, Ukrainians abroad are increasingly adapting, shifting their opinions towards staying abroad.&quot; The main obstacles to return are of both military and economic nature, including ongoing security risks, destroyed housing, low living standards, and challenges in finding employment in Ukraine, according to CES. Women and children remain the predominant demographic among refugees. Adult women make up the largest group at 44%, down from 50% in early 2024. The latest study pointed to a growing proportion of men among Ukrainians living abroad. &quot;The profile of Ukrainian refugees has changed significantly since late 2022. While women and children comprised the vast majority at the start of the war, the proportion of adult men has risen substantially,&quot; said Mykhailyshyna. The study found that women are 31% more likely to want to return than men, and those working remotely for Ukrainian companies are 67% more likely to return than unemployed refugees. Those with higher pre-war incomes are nearly three times more likely to return than those with the lowest incomes. The study found that refugees in Poland are 90% more likely to want to return than those in Germany. Most Ukrainian refugees have settled in Germany (20%) and Poland (18%), while the United States hosts only 5.4% of all refugees. Together with Canada, North American countries have taken in less than 10% of Ukrainian refugees, with most finding refuge in European countries, CES wrote. By the end of November 2024, approximately 4.2 million Ukrainians held temporary protection status in EU countries, with the largest numbers in Germany (1.2 million), Poland (988,000), and the Czech Republic (385,000).	https://kyivindependent.com/5-2-million-ukrainian-refugees-remain-abroad-less-than-half-plan-to-return-poll-says/	2025-02-21T05:46:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2028788729.jpg
EU seeks more US gas to replace Russian supplies	The European Union will seek to increase gas purchases from the U.S. and other countries to replace Russian supplies, EU Energy Commissioner Dan Jorgensen said in a joint media interview, Reuters reported on Feb. 21. Europe began to wean itself off Russian energy commodities after Moscow&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, while Gazprom steadily reduced flows to the EU to pressure Ukraine&#x2019;s allies. Russian gas imports to the EU had dropped by 75% as of January, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. According to Jorgensen, the EU is also looking to develop renewable energy faster to reduce its overall dependence on fossil fuels. &quot;Instead of using taxpayers&apos; money, citizens&apos; money, to pay for gas where the revenue goes into (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&apos;s war chest, we need to make sure that we produce our own energy,&quot; Jorgensen said. Jorgensen added that Brussels is preparing changes to its permitting rules to speed up the construction of renewable energy facilities. He added that the EU is stepping up efforts to find alternative sources of supply for industry and home heating, where gas cannot be quickly replaced by electricity. &quot;There will still be a need for gas, and we will have to look for sources other than Russia, and that could also mean more imports from the U.S.,&quot; Jorgensen said. The U.S. has been boosting its exports of liquified natural gas (LNG) to Europe to reduce the continent&apos;s dependency on Russia. Kyiv&apos;s decision not to prolong a gas transit deal with Gazprom past December 2024 ended the supply of Russian pipeline gas to the EU. European countries continue buying Russian LNG, purchasing record amounts in 2024. The European Union rejected any connection between the possibility of resuming Russian pipeline gas purchases and peace talks on ending the Russia-Ukraine war. The EU imposed its first major restrictions on Russian gas, including LNG, in its 14th sanctions package in June 2024. Russia still remains Europe&apos;s second-largest importer of LNG after the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-seeks-more-us-gas-to-replace-russian-supplies-energy-comissioner-says/	2025-02-21T05:11:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2159134522.jpg
Over 130 Ukrainian NGOs say elections 'impossible' during war	Over 130 Ukrainian civil society organizations said that Russia&apos;s war of aggression makes it impossible for Ukraine to hold presidential and parliamentary elections while martial law is in effect in a joint statement published on Feb. 20. &quot;The legitimacy of the Ukrainian government is the exclusive prerogative of the Ukrainian people,&quot; the statement of the Ukrainian NGOs read. The news comes after U.S. President Donald Trump denounced Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky as a &quot;dictator&quot; while lambasting the country for not holding elections under daily Russian strikes and with one-fifth of its territory occupied. Trump&apos;s statement echoes Russian narratives attacking Zelensky&apos;s presidential legitimacy. Ukraine was set to hold the presidential election in the spring of 2024, but the vote was postponed as martial law, imposed after the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, does not allow elections, according to Ukraine&apos;s constitution. According to the NGO statement spearheaded by the Civil Network Opora, elections must be preceded by a stable ceasefire backed by security guarantees and proper preparations for the election process, including restoring relevant infrastructure. The declaration names the lack of legal mechanisms for ensuring voter participation during wartime as the key obstacle. Zelensky&apos;s administration pledged to hold elections &quot;immediately&quot; after the end of the war, thus allowing soldiers and refugees to safely take part in the vote as well. &quot;The Ukrainian consensus on elections no earlier than six months after the end of martial law is supported by the authorities, the opposition, and the society,&quot; the statement by the Ukrainian NGOs read. According to a February survey, 69% of Ukrainians believe that Zelensky should remain in office until the next elections can be held after the end of martial law. Several opposition politicians also supported this position, warning against Russian attempts to use the elections to divide society.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-130-ukrainian-ngos-say-elections-impossible-during-war/	2025-02-21T04:53:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1156984375.jpg
Kremlin denies demanding NATO eastern rollback in talks with US	Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claimed on Feb. 21 that Russia did not ask the U.S. to withdraw troops from NATO&apos;s eastern flank during talks in Saudi Arabia. The spokesperson said this in reaction to an article by the Financial Times claiming that during the talks in Riyadh on Feb. 18, Russian delegates demanded the NATO rollback as a condition for &quot;normalizing relations.&quot; &quot;No, this is not true,&quot; Peskov told journalists when asked about the claims, the state new agency TASS reported. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. &quot;Our stance on the expansion of NATO&apos;s military infrastructure over several waves toward our borders is a cause of concern for us. This position is well known; it is no secret to anyone,&quot; Peskov added. The U.S. delegation reportedly rejected the demand, but concerns remain over what concessions President Donald Trump might consider to secure a deal with Russia on ending its war against Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin frequently claims that NATO poses a threat to Russia, accusing the alliance of seeking to expand its borders eastward. Moscow has repeatedly used Ukraine&apos;s possible entry into NATO as one of the justifications for launching its full-scale invasion. Russia previously demanded the NATO rollback from its eastern flank during unsuccessful talks in late 2021 that were meant to stave off the impending full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The alliance rejected the demand at the time.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-denies-demanding-nato-eastern-rollback-in-talks-with-us/	2025-02-21T03:46:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245735181.jpeg
63% of Ukrainians approve Zelensky as president, poll shows	Around 63% of Ukrainians approve of Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s actions as a president, according to a survey carried out by the Identity and Borders in Flux: The case of Ukraine (IBIF) project in partnership with the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) and published on Feb. 19. The poll was published shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump alleged that Zelensky holds a &quot;4% approval rating&quot; without providing a source to back his claim. Soon after, Trump dubbed Zelensky as a &quot;dictator.&quot; The survey was conducted between November 2024 and January 2025 with the participation of 1,600 respondents. The IBIF project is primarily funded by the British Academy, with additional funding from ZOiS and George Washington University&apos;s Institute for European, Russian, and Eurasian Studies. Some 26.1% of Ukrainians said they fully approve of Zelensky, while another 36.9% said they tend to approve of him. The overall figure is higher than in polls conducted before Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and in the spring of 2024. The poll showed that 14.4% fully disapprove of Zelensky&apos;s actions as a president, while 18.3% said they tend to disapprove of him. A total of 73% of respondents said they could call Zelensky an &quot;intelligent person,&quot; while 63% called him a &quot;strong leader.&quot; Zelensky remains the most popular Ukrainian politician, leading in polls for the future presidential election, KIIS wrote. Around 26%-32% of Ukrainians are ready to vote for Zelensky in the first round, according to the survey. Zelensky significantly outpaces his predecessor, businessman and lawmaker Petro Poroshenko, who polled at 5%-6%. &quot;A potential contender in a run-off could be a popular military figure General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, former &#x441;ommander-in-&#x441;hief and current Ukrainian ambassador to the U.K., but he has not voiced publicly any political ambitions,&quot; KIIS said. Another KIIS poll published on Feb. 19 showed that, as of February, around 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky, an increase of five percentage points since December. Ukraine was to hold the presidential election in the spring of 2024 but the vote was postponed due to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The Ukrainian constitution does not permit elections during martial law. Russia has sought to use this to undermine Zelensky&apos;s legitimacy as president, a narrative more recently promoted by Trump.	https://kyivindependent.com/63-of-ukrainians-approve-zelensky-as-president-poll-shows/	2025-02-21T03:14:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199789864-2.jpg
Sweden suspects sabotage after new undersea cable damage	The Swedish authorities have launched a sabotage investigation after an undersea telecoms cable was damaged in the Baltic Sea, the Swedish newspaper Goteborgs-Posten reported on Feb. 21. The news comes following a string of cases of damaged undersea infrastructure in the region, with some officials connecting the incidents to hybrid attacks and Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet.&quot; The fiber-optic cable running between Finland and Germany was damaged near Gotland Island within the Swedish exclusive economic zone, Sweden&apos;s Coast Guard said. The Finnish telecom operator Cinia described the damage as minor and said it did not impact the cable&apos;s functionality. According to the Finnish media, this is the third time the cable has been damaged in a short span of time. The Swedish Coast Guard said the incident was first recorded on Feb. 20, but it remains unclear when it occurred. &quot;We take all reports of potential damage to infrastructure in the Baltic Sea very seriously,&quot; Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on X. &quot;As I have already said, these incidents must be viewed in the context of the existing serious security situation.&quot; NATO has ramped up its presence in the Baltic Sea following multiple cases of damaged infrastructure, deploying additional patrol vessels to ward off potential sabotage. While Russian-linked vessels have been detained in connection to the incidents, some voices in the U.S. and European intelligence community believe them to be the result of simple accidents. The suspicions nevertheless add to the tensions between NATO and Russia as the West threw its support behind Ukraine in the face of the Russian invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/sweden-suspects-sabotage-after-new-undersea-cable-damage/	2025-02-21T02:49:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197221651.jpg
Ukrainian edtech company Headway joins global entrepreneur network Endeavor	Educational technology company Headway has become the first Ukraine-born business selected to join Endeavor, a global network of entrepreneurs, the company announced in a press release on Feb. 21. The selection marks a milestone for Ukraine&apos;s tech sector, coming almost three years after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and following Endeavor&apos;s launch in the country in October 2024. The membership gives Headway access to Endeavor&apos;s network of 2,800 entrepreneurs and potential funding through Endeavor Catalyst, the organization&apos;s investment fund that can invest up to $2 million in member companies. &quot;This is a powerful signal for Ukrainian startups: our companies are visible to the whole world and have a great chance of entering global markets,&quot; said Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, noting that Endeavor&apos;s network includes companies like Glovo, Amazon, and Netflix. Headway, founded in 2019, develops educational applications focused on lifelong learning and has reached more than 130 million users worldwide. The company operates in over 170 countries, including the U.S. and the U.K. &quot;It&apos;s a mark of quality, as Endeavor brings together companies with a high level of trust &#x2014; they all undergo a rigorous selection process,&quot; said Headway founder Anton Pavlovsky. The organization evaluates approximately 5,000 companies annually, selecting only 80-90 for membership. Currently, Endeavor Ukraine is reviewing about 100 companies with Ukrainian roots for potential membership, with several already undergoing the selection process. Vargha Moayed, who helped build UiPath into a $20 billion company and participated in Headway&apos;s evaluation, praised the company&apos;s track record. &quot;Headway has proven success, having bootstrapped the company,&quot; Moayed said. &quot;The company&apos;s leaders remain eager to scale the business further.&quot; Sviatoslav Sviatnenko, Endeavor Ukraine&apos;s founding managing director, aims to select at least three companies with Ukrainian roots annually. &quot;For a long time, Ukraine&apos;s tech ecosystem remained somewhat isolated from international hubs, networks, and markets,&quot; Sviatnenko said. He added that Endeavor Catalyst might make its first investment in Ukraine in 2025. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the Ukraine-Moldova American Enterprise Fund (UMAEF) supported Endeavor&apos;s launch in Ukraine. The organization&apos;s board includes Vital Laptenok, Flyer One Ventures general partner and Genesis co-founder, as chair. Founded in 1997, Endeavor operates in 45 countries across Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and the United States. The organization&apos;s portfolio companies generate $67 billion in revenue and provide 4.1 million jobs globally. One in six Endeavor portfolio companies has reached a $1 billion valuation.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-edtech-company-headway-joins-global-entrepreneur-network-endeavor/	2025-02-21T02:03:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/472748632_1675389803406063_6407089676055390814_n.jpg
Russia wants to declare 'victory' over Ukraine on Feb. 24, Ukrainian intel claims	Russia is instructing its propagandists to declare &quot;victory&quot; in the war &quot;against Ukraine and NATO&quot; on Feb. 24, the third anniversary of its full-scale invasion, Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) claimed on Feb. 21. After Russia failed to take over Ukraine within days in 2022 and suffered several defeats in 2022, the Kremlin began to push the false claim that Russia was at war with NATO. Western partners have been providing Ukraine with weapons since the beginning of the all-out war but have never sent troops to Ukraine, fearing escalation. According to the intelligence agency, Russia aims to sow despair among Ukrainians, destabilize the situation in the country, and discredit Ukraine among its allies. Russian intelligence services plan to spread the narrative that &quot;Ukraine has been betrayed&quot; by the West and the U.S., HUR claimed. Russian propaganda will also keep on questioning the legitimacy of President Volodymyr Zelensky and &quot;the corrupt Ukrainian officials who steal U.S. aid.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s allies had generally ignored a propaganda narrative about Zelensky&apos;s legitimacy until U.S. President Donald Trump accused Ukraine of starting the war and appeared to echo the Kremlin&apos;s lines, dubbing Ukraine&apos;s president as a dictator. This claim ignores the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. As a result, Zelensky&apos;s term has been extended, which constitutional lawyers argue is permitted under Ukrainian law. HUR says that the Kremlin may use the recent U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia to impose its terms of peace on the world, trying to portray governments in Europe that back Kyiv as &quot;enemies of peace.&quot; No concrete decisions were announced following the meeting between American and Russian delegations, but Ukraine&apos;s exclusion sparked alarm in Kyiv and Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-wants-to-declare-victory-over-ukraine-on-feb-24-military-intelligence-claims/	2025-02-21T01:37:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200027818.jpg
Azerbaijan suspends local BBC News office	Baku has ordered the suspension of the BBC News Azerbaijani office, allowing only one journalist to remain active in the country, the BBC said on Feb. 20. The British broadcaster confirmed that it had taken the &quot;reluctant decision&quot; to close the office following verbal instructions from the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry. Azerbaijani authorities did not disclose reasons for the decisions but said their steps are always &quot;guided by the principle of reciprocity in all its decisions and relations with the media of foreign countries.&quot; Observers have pointed to deteriorating freedom of the press in the South Caucasus state, which Reporters Without Borders ranked 164th out of 180 countries last year. &quot;We deeply regret this restrictive move against press freedom, which will hinder our ability to report to and from Azerbaijan for our audiences inside and outside the country,&quot; the BBC said in a statement. The BBC News Azerbaijani has been in operation since 1994, providing Azerbaijani-language news to roughly 1 million people weekly via radio and online platforms, the news agency said.	https://kyivindependent.com/azerbaijan-suspends-local-bbc-news-office/	2025-02-21T01:28:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1134811110.jpg
UK, Norway discuss Arctic defense pact over Russian threat	The U.K. and Norway on Feb. 20 launched discussions on a major defense pact to deter possible Russian aggression in the Arctic region. The agreement, designed to bolster British and Norwegian armed forces while deepening industrial cooperation, comes amid mounting tensions between Russia and NATO and concerns about the U.S.&apos;s commitment to Europe&apos;s security. &quot;With Russia continuing to militarise the High North and Arctic, this new agreement will boost security for the U.K., Norway, and our NATO allies, bolstering defenses on NATO&#x2019;s northern flank,&quot; the British government said in a statement. The discussions also concern the protection of undersea infrastructure after several cables were damaged in recent months with suspected Russian involvement. &quot;The U.K. is determined to play a leadership role on European security, supporting the foundations for our security and prosperity at home and showing our adversaries that we are united in our determination to protect our interests,&quot; U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said. European countries are looking to jointly strengthen security as the Trump administration signals reduced presence on the continent and urges Europe to take up responsibility for backing Ukraine against Russian aggression. After two European summits earlier this week, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is planning to visit Washington to meet Trump and reportedly pitch a plan for 30,000 European peacekeepers in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-norway-discuss-arctic-defense-pact-over-russian-threat/	2025-02-21T00:48:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/brit.jpg
Trump-Putin meeting depends on progress on ending war, Rubio says	A possible meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin will largely depend on whether &quot;we can make any progress&quot; on ending the war in Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview with journalist Catherine Herridge aired on X on Feb. 20. Rubio discussed a potential Trump-Putin meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Saudi Arabia, the U.S. secretary of state said. Trump said he would &quot;probably&quot; meet Putin before the end of February. When asked if he expected the meeting later in 2025, the U.S. secretary of state replied that he did not know the timing. &quot;There isn&#x2019;t going to be a meeting until we know what the meeting is going to be about,&quot; he said. American and Russian delegations met in Riyadh on Feb. 18. No concrete decisions on peace talks were announced following the talks, but Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the meeting sparked alarm in Kyiv and Europe. Rubio voiced uncertainty about whether Moscow was serious about ending the war, adding that Trump wanted to know the answer before a possible meeting. &quot;The only way is to test them, to basically engage them and say, okay, are you serious about ending the war, and if so, what are your demands? &#xA0;Are your public demands and your private demands different?&quot; Rubio said. &quot;It may turn out that they don&#x2019;t want to end the war. &#xA0;I don&#x2019;t know; we&#x2019;re going to find out.&quot; Rubio said the necessity for peace talks was &quot;the only thing&quot; the U.S. and Russia agreed on. &quot;What they (Russia) offer, what they&apos;re willing to give up, what they&apos;re willing to consider will determine whether they&apos;re serious about peace or not,&quot; he added. Following U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia, Rubio told alarmed European officials that the Trump administration has no plans to impose the terms of any bilateral agreements with Russia on Ukraine and Europe, the New York Times reported on Feb. 21, citing an obtained summary of the call. According to Rubio, Washington clearly understood that Russia could try to use the talks to split the West or to weaken Moscow&apos;s isolation in the world, according to the NYT. He also reportedly told European partners that Washington would not lift U.S. sanctions against Russia without a marked change in Russia&apos;s stance, but he did not rule out a limited easing of some sanctions if Moscow took the steps the U.S. administration wanted. Trump has pushed to mediate a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia while using increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Kyiv. After accusing Ukraine of starting the war, Trump dubbed President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator without elections.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/the-only-way-is-to-test-them-trump-putin-meeting-depends-on-progress-on-ending-russian-war-rubio-says/	2025-02-21T00:27:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1152488863.jpg
Ukraine launching faster drone supply model for military	Ukraine&apos;s Defense Procurement Agency is launching a new supply model for delivering drones to the front line within weeks rather than months, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Feb. 20. Kyiv has ramped up domestic drone production over the past year. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks throughout the full-scale with Russia. According to the new model, military units will be able to choose the unmanned systems best suited to their needs. The system also aims to support manufacturers through advance orders, allowing them to plan for scaling up their production. The model aims to boost transparency in procurement as it establishes clear supply mechanisms and stimulates competition. The structure is based on the DOT-Chain, an IT system already used by the State Rear Operator (DOT), an agency dealing with non-lethal procurement for the military. DOT-Chain is designed to streamline and digitize procurement processes while reducing delivery time. &quot;Together with manufacturers, we are working to ensure that no soldier waits for weeks or months for what they need,&quot; Umerov said after a meeting with representatives of 200 drone manufacturers.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-launching-faster-drone-supply-model-for-military/	2025-02-20T23:51:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1242279354.jpg
12 killed, 6 injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks across Ukrainian oblasts killed at least 12 civilians and injured at least six over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 21. Russia launched 160 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force said. Eighty-seven drones were shot down, while 70 were lost without causing damage, according to the statement. Russian forces also reportedly fired two Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missiles against Odesa Oblast, the Air Force reported, without providing details on the consequences. During Russian attacks against the Nikopol district in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, two men aged 57 and 73 were killed, and a woman was injured, Governor Serhii Lysak said. Two enterprises, two shops, a cafe, two high-rise buildings, six houses, and other buildings were damaged. Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast killed seven people and injured two, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. An airstrike against the city of Kostiantynivka killed five people, injured one, and damaged multiple buildings. Two more people were reported killed in Mykolaivka and Vesele, and one civilian was injured in Pokrovsk, according to Filashkin. In Kherson Oblast, two people were killed and two injured in Russian attacks, said the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. Fifteen houses and a multi-story building were damaged. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, a man was killed during a Russian attack against Huliaipole, and a woman was injured during a strike on Bilenke, according to Governor Ivan Fedorov.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-130/	2025-02-20T23:09:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-20_15-07-53.jpg
No appetite' for new Ukraine aid bill, US House speaker says	There is no appetite for another assistance bill for Ukraine, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said in an interview with Newsmax on Feb. 20 amid growing tensions between Washington and Kyiv. U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed to mediate a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia while using increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Kyiv. After accusing Ukraine of starting the war, Trump dubbed President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator without elections.&quot; &quot;We have to bring (the war) to an end. And I can tell you that our European allies understand the necessity as well. It&apos;s (dragged) on too long,&quot; Johnson said. Johnson, a Republican and staunch Trump supporter, has served as the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives since October 2023. He delayed aid to Kyiv for six months by refusing to hold a vote on various iterations of a $61 billion foreign assistance bill but eventually reached a deal to pass the legislation in April 2024. The speaker voiced support for the U.S. president, saying he is &quot;the brute force&quot; that can end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Trump&apos;s plan to end the war remains unclear. His special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, said the war could end this year, pledging to &quot;engage all parties&quot; within 180 days to achieve this. American and Russian delegations met in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. No concrete decisions were announced following the talks, but Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the meeting sparked alarm in Kyiv and Europe. Unofficial U.S. and Russian representatives have also reportedly been quietly meeting in Switzerland in recent months for informal discussions regarding Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/no-appetite-for-new-ukraine-aid-bill-us-house-speaker-says/	2025-02-20T22:59:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2036326775-1.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 864,860 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 864,860 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 21. This number includes 1,280 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,146 tanks, 23,462 armored fighting vehicles, 38,104 vehicles and fuel tanks, 23,462 artillery systems, 1,295 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,080 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 26,156 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-864-860-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-02-20T22:08:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1250886494.jpeg
Europe needs 'massive defense plan,' US 'can't be weak' with Putin, Macron says	Europe needs a &quot;massive defense plan&quot; to face the growing threat from Russia, French President Emmanuel Macron said in a wide-ranging social media live feed on Feb. 20. Macron&apos;s remarks come ahead of his planned visit to Washington, D.C., where the French president is set to meet next week with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss peace negotiations in Ukraine. &quot;I&apos;m going to tell him (Trump) &apos;You can&apos;t be weak with (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin. That&apos;s not who you are, it&apos;s not your trademark, it&apos;s not in your interest,&apos;&quot; Macron said on Feb. 20. Macron has been rallying European leaders in recent days to discuss European and Ukrainian security in the wake of shifting U.S. policy towards Russia. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer will join Macron in Washington and will also speak with Trump in a separate meeting. In his Feb. 20 remarks, Macron slammed Russia as a &quot;dangerous military power that has become imperialist.&quot; He said Russia had &quot;globalized&quot; the war in Ukraine by bringing in North Korean troops, and said a worldwide conflict was not off the table. Macron called on Europe to come together to create a &quot;massive defense plan&quot; for the continent. Europe is not likely to form a common army, Macron clarified, but can work to create joint defense capabilities and autonomy from the U.S. Regarding Ukraine, France is open to providing Kyiv with security guarantees, including deploying peacekeeping forces to monitor a potential ceasefire. &quot;I have not decided to send troops to Ukraine tomorrow, no,&quot; Macron added. &quot;What we are considering instead is sending forces to guarantee peace once it has been negotiated.&quot; In partnership with the U.K., France is ready to consider sending experts or even a limited number of troops beyond the front line to demonstrate solidarity and help Ukraine defend itself, Macron said. Supporting NATO membership for Ukraine is among a number of ways France is ready to support Ukraine in its battle against Russia&apos;s aggression, he added. While Macron on Feb. 18 said he would not send combat troops to Ukraine, the French president has been at the forefront of calls to deploy European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire. The U.K. is reportedly going to pitch Trump a plan to deploy 30,000 peacekeepers to Ukraine as a post-ceasefire security guarantee. Trump has said he wants Europe to take over the responsibility of funding and monitoring Ukraine&apos;s defense.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-needs-massive-defense-plan-us-cant-be-weak-with-putin-macron-says/	2025-02-20T21:46:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2033880055.jpg
China backs US-Russia 'consensus' on Ukraine war	China supports the &quot;recent consensus&quot; reached by U.S. and Russian officials regarding the war in Ukraine, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement published Feb. 21. The statement came days after a U.S. delegation sat down with high-level Russian officials in Saudi Arabi on Feb. 18 to discuss ending the war against Ukraine &#x2014;&#xA0;without the participation of Ukraine itself. &quot;China supports all efforts committed to peace, including the recent consensus reached by the United States and Russia, and hopes that all parties concerned can find a sustainable and lasting solution that takes into account each other&apos;s concerns,&quot; the ministry&apos;s statement read. The statement echoed Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi&apos;s remarks at the Group of 20 (G20) foreign ministers meeting in Johannesburg on Feb. 20. Wang also met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the G20 meeting. Beijing is prepared &quot;to play a constructive role in the political settlement of the crisis,&quot; the ministry said. China has remained a key ally of Russia throughout the full-scale invasion, deepening economic ties and becoming Moscow&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods &#x2014; equipment the Russian military uses in its war against Ukraine. Despite these ties, China has insisted it is a neutral party to the war and has long positioned itself as a potential mediator in the conflict. Chinese officials have offered to host a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Feb. 13. In recent days, the Trump administration has upended years of U.S. foreign policy towards Russia and Ukraine. Trump spoke to Putin directly in a phone call on Feb. 12, before calling President Volodymyr Zelensky later that day. Soon after, the U.S. and Russia held talks on Ukraine without Ukraine. Along with ending Moscow&apos;s political isolation, Trump also began parroting Kremlin talking points in his public comments. He repeated false claims about Ukrainian elections and called Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; on social media.	https://kyivindependent.com/china-backs-us-russia-consensus-on-ukraine-war/	2025-02-20T21:02:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200862383.jpg
Tusk proposes 3-point plan to strengthen Ukraine, European security	Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Feb. 20 proposed a three-point plan to strengthen Ukraine in its fight against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and enhance European security. Tusk currently represents the rotating presidency of the EU Council. European leaders have called for increased support for Ukraine and are rethinking security in response to U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s threats to stop supporting security on the continent. Tusk renewed calls to finance Ukraine aid with funds from Russian frozen assets, the majority of which are held in EU banks. &quot;Let&apos;s finance our aid for Ukraine from the Russian frozen assets,&quot; he &#xA0;said in a social media post on Feb. 20. &quot;Let&apos;s strengthen air policing, the Baltic sentry, and the EU borders with Russia. Let&apos;s swiftly adopt new fiscal measures to immediately fund security and defense.&quot; Tusk&apos;s comments come as a shift in U.S. foreign policy towards Ukraine is pushing European officials to consider stepping up support for Kyiv and further toughening their stance on Russia. The U.S. ended a years-long policy of isolating Moscow when American and Russian officials sat down in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 for preliminary talks about ending the war in Ukraine. Neither Ukraine nor Europe were represented at the talks. Trump previously spoke directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call on Feb. 12, holding a separate phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky the same day. The U.S. President has vowed to bring about a speedy end to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;We have no doubt that the threat to Europe is Vladimir Putin&apos;s Russia, Trump&apos;s phone call to Putin was a mistake,&quot; Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said on Feb. 16. The EU introduced a 16th sanctions package against Russia on Feb. 19, targeting Russian aluminum and oil exports in response to Moscow&apos;s continued armed aggression against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/tusk-proposes-3-point-plan-to-strengthen-ukraine-european-security/	2025-02-20T20:08:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183928589.jpg
US, Russian participants held unofficial talks on Ukraine in Switzerland, Reuters reports	Unofficial U.S. and Russian representatives have been quietly meeting in Switzerland in recent months for informal discussions regarding Ukraine, Reuters reported on Feb. 21. The disclosure comes shortly after Russia and the U.S. held preliminary peace talks between high-level officials in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 without Ukraine&apos;s participation. The informal meetings were described as &quot;track two meetings,&quot; a type of unofficial diplomacy meant to lower tension, Reuters reported, citing three unnamed sources. Russia and the U.S. exchanged communication following U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s election victory on Nov. 5, sources said. A few of Trump&apos;s advisors are aware of the informal meetings, one of the unnamed sources with direct knowledge of the meetings told Reuters. The informal meetings held in Switzerland occurred as recently as days ago, coinciding with the Munich Security Conference. The two sides met in Geneva while the conference was still ongoing, two sources said. It is uncertain when the informal meetings began and whether or not Ukrainian representatives were involved, one source said. The attendees are not state officials but held security and diplomatic experience, two of the sources said. It is not clear if their governments sent them to participate in these meetings. The unnamed sources declined to name the attendees of the informal meetings. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Trump&apos;s re-election signaled a dramatic shift in U.S. foreign policy toward Russia. Following the Feb. 18 talks in Riyadh, relations between Kyiv and the Trump administration degenerated further, with Trump going so far as to call President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; &#x2014; a Kremlin talking point meant to undermine the Ukrainian government&apos;s legitimacy. Ukrainian and European officials have warned against holding negotiations about Ukraine without Ukraine&apos;s participation. Ukraine will not accept a peace deal negotiated behind its back, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 17.	https://kyivindependent.com/unofficial-russian-and-u-s-representatives-quietly-met-to-discuss-ukraine-in-switzerland-reuters-reports/	2025-02-20T18:54:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1248858240.jpeg
Meeting with Kellogg 'restores hope,' Zelensky says	U.S. Special Envoy Keith Kellogg&apos;s visit to Kyiv &quot;restores hope,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said following their meeting on Feb. 20. Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, spoke to Zelensky earlier in the day as part of Washington&apos;s efforts to broker a resolution in Russia&apos;s full-scale war. It was &quot;a meeting that restores hope,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;(A)nd we need strong agreements with America &#x2014; agreements that will really work.&quot; The meeting occurred on the backdrop of mounting tensions between Washington and Kyiv in recent days. Ukraine was not invited when the U.S. and Russia held talks in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. Trump praised the U.S.-Russia talks and shortly thereafter began parroting Kremlin talking points in his public remarks, calling Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and lying about his approval rating. Zelensky objected to Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the Riyadh talks and shot back at Trump&apos;s false claims, saying he would &quot;like there to be more truth in Trump&apos;s team.&quot; When Kellogg arrived in Ukraine on Feb. 19, he said his aim was to &quot;listen&quot; to Kyiv&apos;s concerns and relay his findings to the White House. Kellogg had been sidelined from the talks in Saudi Arabia, possibly because the Russian delegation disliked his perceived pro-Ukraine stance. Kellogg met with top Ukrainian military and government officials during his visit. While Zelensky sounded a hopeful note after his meeting with Kellogg, Washington requested that there be no joint press briefing following the conversation. Zelensky said the talks focused on front-line developments, prisoners of war (POWs) in Russian captivity, and Ukraine&apos;s need for long-term security guarantees. &quot;We all need peace: Ukraine, Europe, America, everyone in the world,&quot; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/meeting-with-kellogg-restores-hope-zelensky-says/	2025-02-20T18:20:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200014655.jpg
UK’s Lammy sees no Russian willingness for peace at G20 meeting	U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that the Kremlin shows no interest in pursuing peace in Ukraine, following a speech by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at a closed-door session of the G20 foreign ministers&apos; meeting in Johannesburg on Feb. 20. Speaking to reporters after the session, Lammy criticized Lavrov&#x2019;s remarks, saying they did not indicate any willingness to negotiate a settlement, according to the Associated Press. He also noted that Lavrov left the room before Lammy had the chance to deliver his own speech. The G20 meeting, taking place in South Africa, follows recent U.S.-Russia bilateral talks over ending the war in Ukraine&#x2014;talks that excluded both Ukraine and its European allies. Tensions have been further heightened by U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s comments blaming Ukraine for the war and his criticism of President Volodymyr Zelensky. In his speech, released by the U.K. Foreign Office, Lammy accused Russia of engaging in &quot;Tsarist imperialism&quot; and failing to learn from historical colonial wars. He expressed disappointment in Lavrov&#x2019;s speech, saying he had hoped for acknowledgment of civilian suffering and a commitment to a durable peace, but instead heard what he described as &quot;the logic of imperialism.&quot; Lammy dismissed Lavrov&#x2019;s remarks as &quot;tired fabrications&quot; and urged G20 members not to be misled by Russia&#x2019;s justifications for its actions. The G20, which includes major global economies alongside the EU and African Union, has struggled to find common ground on key geopolitical issues, particularly Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, in his opening address, urged member states to engage in constructive dialogue amid ongoing global crises, including war, climate change, and economic instability. However, U.S. disengagement from the summit signals the Trump administration&#x2019;s continued prioritization of its &quot;America First&quot; agenda over multilateral cooperation.	https://kyivindependent.com/uks-lammy-sees-no-russian-willingness-for-peace-at-g20-meeting/	2025-02-20T16:34:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172936127.jpg
US objects to 'Russian aggression' language in G7 statement, straining unity on Ukraine, FT reports	The United States is opposing the use of the term &quot;Russian aggression&quot; in a planned G7 statement marking the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, creating tensions among allied nations, an official familiar with the matter told the Financial Times (FT). Traditionally, G7 leaders issue a joint declaration on Feb. 24 reaffirming their support for Ukraine, but U.S. envoys have objected to language that explicitly blames Russia, according to Western officials. Meanwhile, President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s participation in the virtual G7 summit has not yet been confirmed, and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has announced she will not take part. &quot;We are adamant that there must be a distinction made between Russia and Ukraine. They are not the same,&quot; the official told the Financial Times. &quot;The Americans are blocking that language, but we are still working on it and hopeful of an agreement.&quot; The shift in U.S. rhetoric follows statements from President Donald Trump, who has blamed Ukraine for the war, accused Zelensky of acting like a &quot;dictator,&quot; and suggested that Russia should be invited back into the G7. Trump has also engaged directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin, authorizing bilateral talks aimed at ending the war. These moves have alarmed Ukraine and European allies, who see them as a departure from Washington&#x2019;s previous firm stance against Russian military actions. The U.S. State Department has increasingly used the phrase &quot;Ukraine conflict&quot; instead of referring to Russian aggression, signaling a broader policy shift. Adding to tensions, a scheduled news conference between Zelensky and Trump&#x2019;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, was canceled at Washington&#x2019;s request. While Zelensky described his discussions with Kellogg as constructive and detailed, the cancellation reinforced concerns about the changing US approach. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz escalated criticism of Kyiv, saying Trump was frustrated with Zelenskyy&#x2019;s perceived lack of gratitude for US support. Waltz also suggested Ukraine should reopen talks on a critical minerals deal, after Trump claimed the US was owed $500 billion worth of Ukrainian resources in exchange for military aid. In the US, Republican leaders have signaled growing reluctance to approve additional funding for Ukraine. House Speaker Mike Johnson stated that there is &#x201C;no appetite&#x201D; for another aid package, adding that the conflict must be brought to an end. Tech billionaire Elon Musk, a key Trump ally, echoed the US president&#x2019;s criticisms of Zelensky, falsely claiming that he is unpopular in Ukraine and has avoided holding elections. However, polling by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology contradicts this, showing Zelensky&#x2019;s approval rating at 57%, an increase from 52% in December. French President Emmanuel Macron has announced plans to meet Trump in Washington to discuss Ukraine, warning that the US must not appear weak in dealing with Putin. Macron defended Zelensky&#x2019;s legitimacy, adding that elections are impossible under wartime conditions. Meanwhile, Meloni&#x2019;s absence from the G7 call has raised questions about how she will navigate the growing divide between Trump&apos;s administration and European leaders. While she has been a strong supporter of Ukraine, her alignment with Trump could position her as a key EU liaison with the White House in future discussions on the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-objects-to-russian-aggression-language-in-g7-statement-straining-unity-on-ukraine-ft-reports/	2025-02-20T14:44:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2161853322.jpg
Russian hackers target Signal accounts in growing espionage effort	Google&#x2019;s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) has identified a rise in Russian state-backed hacking attempts aimed at compromising Signal messenger accounts. These attacks primarily target individuals of interest to Russia&apos;s intelligence services, including military personnel, government officials, journalists, and activists. While these efforts are currently tied to Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine, experts warn that similar tactics may soon be adopted by other threat actors worldwide. The broader concern extends beyond Signal, as Russian-aligned groups have also been observed targeting messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram using comparable methods, according to the group&apos;s latest report published on Feb. 19. Experts warn that these attacks signal a growing global trend in cyber espionage, where governments and hacking groups are increasingly seeking to infiltrate secure messaging apps. The primary technique used in these attacks involves exploiting Signal&#x2019;s &quot;linked devices&quot; feature, which allows users to connect additional devices to their accounts. Hackers have crafted malicious QR codes that, when scanned, link a victim&#x2019;s Signal account to a hacker-controlled device. This enables them to intercept messages in real-time without needing direct access to the victim&#x2019;s phone. Phishing campaigns distributing these malicious QR codes have been disguised as legitimate Signal security alerts, group invitations, or even official device-pairing instructions from the Signal website. In some cases, hackers have embedded these QR codes within fake applications designed to mimic software used by the Ukrainian military. Beyond remote phishing, Russian cyber operatives have also deployed this tactic in battlefield scenarios. The group APT44&#x2014;also known as Sandworm, a unit linked to Russia&#x2019;s military intelligence agency (GRU)&#x2014;has reportedly used the method on captured devices. Soldiers&#x2019; Signal accounts are being linked to Russian-controlled infrastructure, allowing continued surveillance of sensitive conversations. This approach is difficult to detect because Signal does not have a centralized system for flagging new linked devices, meaning a successful breach could remain unnoticed for an extended period. Signal, in collaboration with Google, has since strengthened its security measures to counter these phishing attempts. The latest updates for both Android and iOS include enhanced protections designed to prevent unauthorized device linking. Users are urged to update their apps to the newest version and remain cautious of suspicious QR codes or unexpected device-linking requests.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-hackers-target-signal-accounts-in-growing-espionage-effort/	2025-02-20T14:17:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2150495001.jpg
Trump administration presents 'improved' minerals draft to Ukraine after Zelensky's rejection, Axios reports	The U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration has presented Ukraine with an &quot;improved&quot; draft of a minerals agreement after President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected the initial proposal, Axios reported on Feb. 20, citing sources familiar with the matter. &quot;This is a negotiation. And in a negotiation, you negotiate. Ukraine wants to negotiate minerals, so we&apos;re talking about it,&quot; a White House official was quoted as saying. Following his meeting with Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Zelensky signaled Kyiv&apos;s openness to a &quot;strong, beneficial agreement&quot; with the U.S. on investments and security. &quot;We have proposed the quickest and most constructive way to achieve results,&quot; he said. According to Axios, several of Zelensky&apos;s aides encouraged him to sign the updated deal to avoid further tensions with Trump and allow the president to justify continued American support for Ukraine. The revised draft has reportedly been &quot;significantly improved&quot; to align with Ukrainian law. Trump previously suggested that new aid shipments could depend on trade deals the U.S. negotiates with Ukraine. On Feb. 3, Trump said he wanted to provide Kyiv with weapons and aid in exchange for &quot;rare earths and other things.&quot; The original U.S. proposal reportedly sought a 50% interest in Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas, as well as stakes in ports and other key infrastructure through a joint investment fund. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent delivered the initial draft to Zelensky during his visit to Kyiv last week. Ukraine&apos;s leader said Kyiv is not ready to sign the document as it did not include any security guarantees. The proposal comes amid growing tensions between Kyiv and Washington, as Trump has made multiple false claims about Ukraine in recent days, including calling Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and accusing him of refusing to hold elections. Trump&apos;s remarks ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. A Ukrainian official told the Kyiv Independent that Washington had initially sought to condition Ukraine&apos;s signing of the memorandum on Zelensky&apos;s meeting with U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14. Vance also criticized Zelensky on Feb. 19, calling his public remarks about Trump &quot;counterproductive&quot; after the Ukrainian president dismissed Trump&apos;s claim that his support in Ukraine had fallen to 4%, labeling it Russian disinformation. A Feb. 19 poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) showed that 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky, marking a five-point increase since December.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-administration-presents-improved-minerals-draft-to-ukraine-after-zelenskys-rejection-axios-reports/	2025-02-20T12:45:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198422010.jpg
Exploitation or opportunity? Ukrainian business sees potential in Trump resource deal — if done right	Within weeks of U.S. President Donald Trump saying he wanted to do a deal with Kyiv on its &#x201C;rare earths and other things,&#x201D; it became clear the U.S. wasn&#x2019;t just interested in Ukraine&#x2019;s critical minerals and rare earth elements. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent visited Kyiv on Feb. 12 to present a deal to President Volodymyr Zelensky. After the Ukrainian president refused to sign citing a lack of security guarantees in it, details of the proposed agreement began to surface, setting off a wave of panic the U.S. was asking for too much. According to several reports and a leaked version of the deal, the U.S. was looking for a 50% interest in mineral resources, oil and gas resources, ports, and other infrastructure through a joint investment fund. Such a deal would potentially include some of the country&#x2019;s largest companies, including state-owned oil and gas giants. The proposal, particularly for stakes in Ukraine&#x2019;s large oil and gas sector, hasn&#x2019;t gone over well. Reactions to the deal have included calling it &quot;colonial,&quot; and amounting to asking a country that was invaded to pay reparations, and to its ally. &#x201C;We are not a colony, and there are no other examples of when allies demanded (this) in the middle of the war from their friends. The proposal definitely looks like reparations,&#x201D; said Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a Ukrainian MP.

(Andrew Kravchenko/Bloomberg via Getty Images)The deal is, however, likely just in its early phases. It could be that the Trump administration started the negotiations by asking for a lot with the expectation that the two sides will meet somewhere in the middle, said the President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine, Andy Hunder, who is familiar with the deal. &#x201C;The new administration team came in like a bull into a china shop. So yeah, of course, they&apos;re going to break some cups and plates.&#x201D; Reuters reported on Feb. 20 that the White House may opt for a simplified agreement with details sorted out down the line. If a happy middle ground is found, business people in Ukraine and experts believe the deal could be an opportunity to inject fresh capital into Ukraine&#x2019;s economy, particularly some of its struggling state-owned companies. &#x201C;Our understanding was that the (proposed) deal would help professional fund managers bring better returns to state-owned enterprises &#x2014; many of which have been mismanaged over the past number of years,&#x201D; said Hunder. A deal that includes more than Ukraine&#x2019;s mineral resources or rare earth minerals, may also be due to the fact that the actual volume and value of Ukraine&#x2019;s critical minerals are hugely speculative and hotly debated with official figures based on optimistic Soviet estimates of $12 trillion. On the flip side, Ukraine is known to be rich in natural gas and its ports are strategically located on the Black Sea at the crossroads between Europe and Western Asia. Despite the public outcry against the deal, Kyiv isn&#x2019;t casting it aside. In addition to looking to tie any agreement on resources to security guarantees to bolster its defense, Ukraine&#x2019;s struggling economy needs investment. If done right, the deal could be a win-win situation for both Ukraine and the U.S., said Oleksandr Kharchenko, managing director of the Energy Industry Research Center, a consultancy in Kyiv. &#x201C;In any kind of development in the Ukrainian oil and gas sector, we need money and technology. It&apos;s not something which you can take and it will generate profit. You have to invest a lot to make money in this business,&#x201D; he said. Ukraine&#x2019;s energy sector is lucrative. State oil and gas giant Naftogaz earned 32.4 billion hryvnia ($779 million) in profit in the first nine months of 2024. DTEK, the largest private energy company, earned a gross profit of Hr 4.6 billion ($111 million) from oil and gas production in the first half of 2024, despite the war. State-owned companies have a checkered history of corruption and mismanagement. Large parts of Ukraine&#x2019;s economy have long been dominated by oligarchs. U.S. investors in Ukraine&#x2019;s state-owned enterprises could lead to positive corporate reforms and attract more money, Kharchenko said. More financing and access to American technology will boost Ukraine&#x2019;s oil and gas production, he noted. In turn, Ukraine will have more gas to sustain itself, expand its influence on the gas market, and help replace Russian gas in Europe, an issue that persists despite the EU&#x2019;s efforts to diversify. While it would be &quot;beneficial for international players to come in, Ukraine&#x2019;s interests should be preserved&quot; in any deal, said a representative of a Ukrainian energy company, speaking on condition of anonymity. Zelensky has batted away the idea of Ukraine becoming a piggy bank for countries exploiting its natural resources. Speaking to CNN Turk on Feb. 19, he emphasized Ukraine wants to be &quot;friends and partners&quot; rather than a &#x201C;center for the extraction of raw materials for any continent.&#x201D; One path is offering investment opportunities in return for the liberation of occupied territories, where resources like lithium and gas are located. &#x201C;It&apos;s wise to propose the large share of (occupied resources) to the U.S. if they are able to help us to liberate them,&#x201D; said Zhelezniak.

(Christopher Occhicone/Bloomberg via Getty Images)The question still remains of how the U.S. will offer protection guarantees in the long run although NBC reported that Washington may deploy troops to guard the resources. There is an underlying concern that Trump is not interested in the security of Ukraine as a whole but instead seeking to exploit a vulnerable ally. &#x201C;It is not in anyone&#x2019;s interest to see Ukraine in the future being a devastated land under constant missile and drone bombardment by Russia, with a few plants or resource sites guarded by U.S. special forces &#x2014; like what we saw in Iraq and Syria until very recently,&#x201D; said Roman Sulzhyk, a partner at Ukraine Breakthrough Investments, an investment firm. &#x201C;A more equitable deal would involve only future revenue, from resources developed with U.S. investment and expertise, and tangible security guarantees &#x2014; not just for the sites where Americans operate, but for the whole country,&#x201D; he added. Part of the reaction to the deal may be due to its messaging. If the Trump administration had presented the deal as a concession or a private-public partnership (PPP), it would have offered a different understanding, Hunder said. &#x201C;If you come along and say: &#x2018;give us this,&#x2019; then it&#x2019;s going to be perceived very differently.&#x201D; Ukraine is no stranger to PPPs. Big institutions like the International Finance Corporation (IFC) have overseen billions of dollars in projects in the last decades including in the energy and transportation sectors. Zhelezniak agrees that overall, joint ventures of some kind are &#x201C;a good idea.&#x201D; &#x201C;But it&#x2019;s better to just privatize (state enterprises) and sell them to foreign investors,&#x201D; he said, referencing the sale of UMC Titanium, a state titanium producer that was sold to Cemin Ukraine in October 2024.

(Vincent Mundy/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Since investments in natural resources are a long-term commitment rather than a short-term gain, Zhelezniak emphasizes the need to ensure the agreement is clear and sustainable. It shouldn&#x2019;t be vulnerable to revisions when new governments come into Washington and Kyiv. There is also a legal question. The U.S. proposed governing the deal under New York law, but that could change. Establishing how any part of the deal would be governed will be key, especially given the Ukrainian court system&apos;s bad reputation. Moreover, Ukraine&#x2019;s constitution states the resources belong to the people so it is unclear whether the president has the power to even make this type of deal. Doing so could require constitutional changes. Any deal will &#x201C;have to be ratified and explained to the Ukrainian people. If not, it will create a lot of noise, and zero investments,&#x201D; said Zhelezniak.

Ukraine war latest: Zelensky-Kellogg meeting ends with no joint statements at US request, spokesperson says	Key developments on Feb. 20: President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, in Kyiv on Feb. 20. &quot;We discussed in detail the situation on the battlefield and how to return all our POWs (prisoners of war), as well as effective security guarantees,&quot; the president said on Telegram after the meeting. According to Zelensky, Ukraine is ready for a strong, beneficial agreement with the U.S. regarding investments and security. &quot;We have proposed the quickest and most constructive way to achieve results,&quot; he said. The meeting in Kyiv was expected to be followed by a press briefing, but Washington requested that no joint statements be made, Zelensky&apos;s spokesperson, Serhii Nykyforov, told reporters. Kellogg arrived in Ukraine on Feb. 19 as part of Washington&apos;s efforts to broker a resolution to Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Upon arrival, he said his primary mission was to &quot;listen&quot; to Kyiv&apos;s concerns and relay his findings to the White House. The visit follows U.S.-Russia negotiations in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, where American and Russian officials discussed the war without Ukrainian participation. Zelensky strongly rejected the idea of peace talks being conducted behind Ukraine&apos;s back. Zelensky&apos;s meeting with Kellogg comes amid growing tensions between Kyiv and Washington, as Trump has made several false remarks about Ukraine in recent days, including calling Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and accusing him of refusing to hold elections. His claims ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. During his visit to Ukraine, Kellogg also met with top Ukrainian military and government officials. Kellogg&apos;s role in Trump&apos;s peace efforts remains unclear, as he was not involved in the Feb. 18 talks in Saudi Arabia. Some experts suggest he has been sidelined due to his perceived pro-Ukraine stance and alleged Russian objections to his participation. Trump&apos;s recent remarks have raised concerns in Kyiv and among European allies about Washington&apos;s shifting stance on the war. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer will present U.S. President Donald Trump with a plan to deploy up to 30,000 European troops to monitor a possible ceasefire in Ukraine, the Telegraph reported on Feb. 19, citing undisclosed Western officials. Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron are going to travel to the U.S. next week to discuss the prospects of peace negotiations with Trump. European leaders gathered in Paris on Feb. 17 for an emergency summit amid concerns that Washington is advancing peace talks with Moscow without Europe&#x2019;s involvement. A broader meeting was held on Feb. 19, after which Macron reaffirmed the &quot;united&quot; stance of France and its allies on Ukraine. Starmer is reportedly planning to reveal details of how European troops would be able to enforce any ceasefire brokered by Trump. According to the plan, European troops would be deployed in Ukrainian cities, ports, and other critical infrastructure such as nuclear power plants &quot;far away from the current front lines,&quot; the Telegraph wrote. The U.S. has ruled out sending its own troops while encouraging European allies to take the lead in securing Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability. A Western official claimed the mission would rely on &quot;technical monitoring,&quot; including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, as well as drones and satellites. They also added that sufficient firepower would support the mission to &quot;monitor and shoot those attacks down&quot; to reopen Ukraine&apos;s airspace and allow commercial flights. The purpose of this support is to ensure that &quot;whatever forces are deployed will not be challenged by Russia,&quot; a source told the newspaper. According to the Telegraph, Starmer will urge Trump to keep U.S. fighter jets and missiles in NATO countries in Eastern Europe ready to respond to any future Russian aggression. Apart from the U.K. and France, other countries remain cautious about sending their troops to Ukraine, citing concerns over the escalation and limited military resources, according to the Washington Post. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Kyiv had made significant progress in securing a foreign military presence on its territory. On Jan. 22, Zelensky said the number of European peacekeepers required to maintain peace in Ukraine would depend on the size of Ukraine&apos;s own military. The U.S. is refusing to co-sponsor a UN resolution marking the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, which reaffirms Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity and condemns Moscow&apos;s aggression, Reuters reported on Feb. 20, citing sources familiar with the matter. &quot;In previous years, the United States has consistently co-sponsored such resolutions in support of a just peace in Ukraine,&quot; a source told Reuters. The upcoming UN vote, considered a key indicator of global support for Ukraine, can proceed without U.S. backing but may struggle to gain widespread support in the General Assembly. The U.S. also opposed directly calling Russia the &quot;aggressor&quot; in a G7 statement marking the anniversary of the invasion, according to the Financial Times. This is the first time the U.S. has pushed back on such language. The reports follow recent diplomatic efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration to engage with Russia, as well as a number of Trump&apos;s false accusations against Ukraine and its President Volodymyr Zelensky. On Feb. 18, Secretary of State Marco Rubio led a U.S. delegation to Saudi Arabia for direct talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Trump has made several controversial statements about Ukraine in recent days, including calling President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and falsely accusing him of refusing to hold elections. His claims ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. Trump has also suggested that Ukraine should repay the U.S. for its military assistance through a deal involving the country&apos;s natural resources, claiming &#x2014; without evidence &#x2014; that Kyiv had &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a deal worth $500 billion. On Feb. 19, Zelensky said that Ukraine&apos;s wartime military expenses had totaled $320 billion, with the U.S. and EU providing a combined $200 billion in defense support. &quot;We, the people of Ukraine, (covered) $120 billion, the U.S. and the EU &#x2014; $200 billion. We are talking about arms; this is a weapons package worth $320 billion,&quot; Zelensky said in Kyiv. Trump&apos;s recent remarks have raised concerns in Kyiv and among European allies about Washington&apos;s shifting stance on the war. U.S. President Donald Trump said that Russia holds &quot;the cards&quot; in any peace talks with Ukraine as they occupy a significant part of Ukrainian territory, the BBC reported on Feb. 20. &quot;I think the Russians want to see the war end, I really do. I think they have the cards a little bit, because they&apos;ve taken a lot of territory. They have the cards,&quot; Trump told journalists on Air Force One. A U.S. delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio met top Russian officials for talks in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, marking the highest-level meeting between the two sides since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022. Ukraine was not invited to participate. No concrete decisions were announced following the U.S.-Russia talks, though both Moscow and Washington praised the meeting as constructive. Ukraine&apos;s exclusion sparked alarm in Kyiv and Europe. The U.S. and Russia signaled that a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin could occur before the end of February. Speaking after the Riyadh talks, Trump voiced his belief that Russia wishes to end the war and laid the blame for the ongoing hostilities on Ukraine. He subsequently attacked President Volodymyr Zelensky as a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; while pressing the besieged country to hold a vote. Kremlin propaganda has pushed the narrative that Zelensky is an illegitimate leader, relying on the premise that his first presidential term was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024. Trump&apos;s claim ignores the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. A Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) operation was behind the detonations of goggles for first-person-view (FPV) drones used by Russian soldiers, a HUR source told the Kyiv Independent on Feb. 20. The news comes after Russian pro-war Telegram channels reported a series of explosions of FPV goggles while they were being used by Russian drone operators. According to the source, HUR bought a large batch of FPV goggles for the operation and rigged them with explosives and a detonation mechanism. According to the source, a large batch of FPV goggles was bought for the operation and equipped with explosives and a remote detonation function. (HUR source)&quot;Russian volunteers&quot; subsequently donated the goggles to Russian drone units &quot;in coordination&quot; with the agency, according to the source.&quot;Today, the horrors of war are literally happening right before the eyes of Russian FPV pilots. This is a well-deserved punishment for the war crimes that the Russian occupiers commit against Ukraine every day,&quot; the HUR source said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Throughout Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing warfare. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks by Ukrainian troops. FPV drones are cheap to manufacture and can be precisely flown into targets, allowing their users to destroy much more expensive military equipment. Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in its Kursk Oblast captured by Ukraine, senior Russian General Staff officer Sergei Rudsky claimed in an interview with the Russian Defense Ministry newspaper published on Feb. 20. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. According to Rudsky, Ukrainian soldiers are in control of about 500 square kilometers (193 square miles) out of 1,268 square kilometers (490 square miles) initially seized by Kyiv. The Russian general claimed that Russian troops were now advancing in Kursk Oblast in all directions, and the Ukrainian army was &quot;retreating from their positions.&quot; The Ukrainian military has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed on Feb. 18 that Russian forces had crossed into Ukrainian territory from Kursk Oblast, which Ukraine&apos;s General Staff dismissed. Despite months of being on the defensive, Ukrainian forces reportedly advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in the region in a new offensive in early February. Over six months of fighting in the region, Russian casualties have reached nearly 40,000 personnel, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 6. Another 909 have been reportedly taken as prisoners of war. Ukraine is likely looking to use its foothold in Kursk Oblast as leverage in potential peace talks. Russia&apos;s forces in Kursk Oblast have been bolstered by North Korean troops, deployed last fall to help counter the Ukrainian incursion. President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that the offensive disrupted Russia&apos;s ability to carry out large-scale operations in northeastern and southern Ukraine.

Moscow demanded NATO withdrawal from eastern Europe during US-Russia talks, FT reports	During U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia, Moscow allegedly demanded that the U.S. withdraw NATO forces from eastern Europe as a condition for &quot;normalizing relations,&quot; the Financial Times (FT) reported on Feb. 20, citing two officials in the region. The U.S. delegation reportedly rejected the demand, but concerns remain over what concessions President Donald Trump might consider to secure a deal with Russia. French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer are set to visit Washington next week for talks with Trump, where they are expected to urge him not to concede to Russia&apos;s demands. One unnamed eastern European official told the FT that regional governments are increasingly worried about the trajectory of U.S.-Russia talks and whether their concerns will be taken seriously in the White House. Cristian Diaconescu, the Romanian president&apos;s chief of staff, warned that the U.S.-Russia dialogue risks a &quot;new Yalta,&quot; referring to the 1945 conference where the Allies divided post-war Europe into spheres of influence. Russian President Vladimir Putin frequently claims that NATO poses a threat to Russia, accusing the alliance of seeking to expand its borders eastward. Moscow has repeatedly used Ukraine&apos;s possible entry into NATO as one of the justifications for launching its full-scale invasion. Kyiv argues that joining the alliance would provide it with a vital security guarantee, preventing any future invasion of its territory. The Saudi Arabia meeting on Feb. 18 marked the highest-level U.S.-Russia talks since the full-scale invasion began in 2022. No concrete decisions were announced, but Moscow and Washington described the discussions as constructive. Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the talks has sparked concerns in Kyiv and Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/moscow-demands-nato-withdrawal-from-eastern-europe-in-us-russia-talks-ft-reports/	2025-02-20T11:41:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199670478.jpg
‘We cannot survive’ without foreign weapons, say Ukrainian soldiers fearing looming Trump cuts	A looming dropoff in U.S. weapons deliveries is threatening to strain Ukraine&#x2019;s budding domestic arms production to the breaking point. As U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s administration prepares negotiations with their Russian counterparts, Ukrainians fear being cut out of negotiations &#x2014; and cut off from future U.S. support, including weaponry. Despite Ukraine placing massive bets on localizing arms production, the outlook is grim for a self-sustained Ukrainian war effort. Clever front-line improvisations in drones and electronic warfare have yet to overcome Russia&#x2019;s wartime output of tanks, mortars, missiles, and mines. Russia&#x2019;s drones are, moreover, not half bad. When it comes to armor, Ukraine is often left rehabbing old Soviet vehicles. Ukraine&#x2019;s military still needs to ask the West for a steady stream of long-range missiles and precision air defense. Continuing failures in artillery reveal a core weapons industry that cannot deliver simple weapons en masse. Ukraine has a &#x201C;very low chance of survival&#x201D; without U.S. weapons, President Volodymyr Zelensky told NBC News on Feb. 15. Ukraine has built out its domestic arms production in a big way since the Russian war machine rolled in on Feb.24, 2022. Speaking to Piers Morgan last month, President Volodymyr Zelensky said 40% of Ukraine&#x2019;s weapons are made in Ukraine, as opposed to 10% of total arms used at the outset of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. One of the points of Russia&#x2019;s greatest advantage since the outset of the war is artillery. Specifically, mortar shells &#x2014; a disparity that Ukraine has tried hard to balance. Ukraine&#x2019;s Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin has said that Ukraine already produced 50% of its artillery ammunition in 2024, and will produce &#x201C;just about everything we use&#x201D; in 2025. Smetanin&#x2019;s recently reassigned predecessor Alexander Kamyshin said in September that Ukraine had begun producing 155 mm shells &#x2014; a NATO standard size for howitzers, as opposed to the Soviet 152 mm. But the problem is simple, says Roman &#x201C;Cat&#x201D; Kotliarov, an artillerist in the Ukrainian military who recently relocated from Donbas to man a 122 mm mortar in northern Kharkiv Oblast, near the Russian border. &#x201C;Those shells are no good,&#x201D; referring to Ukrainian-made mortar shells. &#x201C;If you&apos;re talking about Ukrainian mortar shells, which are produced in Ukraine, they&#x2019;re very low quality. I don&apos;t like to work with them,&#x201D; Kotliarov told the Kyiv Independent. Ukrainian soldiers preparing a mortar in the direction of Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk Oblast on Feb. 9, 2024. (Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu via Getty Images)About 70% of the ammunition that reaches Kotliarov and his team these days is made in Ukraine. His four-man crew is scared to use them. &#x201C;Last time I was in a position where my guys were fighting, they put a shell in the mortar. It made a boom and the shell fell five meters away from them,&#x201D; Kotliarov said. &#x201C;It&apos;s very dangerous. Thank god my guys are alive and everything&#x2019;s ok.&#x201D; An embarrassing series of investigations from Ukrainian outlet Suspilne forced the Strategic Industries Ministry to recall some 30,000 defective mortar shells in January. In addition to incompetence, those reports suggest a siphoning off of powder somewhere along the supply line. Accounts like Kotliarov&#x2019;s show that bad shells continue to dog soldiers rebuffing Russian assaults. The functional mortar shell supply remains dependent on international detritus. &#x201C;The U.S., Poland, Italy &#x2014; we even get mortar rounds from India. Foreign shells are more or less ok,&#x201D; he continued. &#x201C;Ukrainian shells, where my president spent a lot of money &#x2014; they&#x2019;re trash.&#x201D; Another soldier, a captain by the call sign of &#x201C;Artem&#x201D; who recently rebased after two and a half years in frontline artillery to a desk job in Kyiv, is similarly critical of Ukraine&#x2019;s local production of the mortars themselves. &#x201C;The only Ukrainian-made mortar I used was made in Sumy. In 1942,&#x201D; he told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;It weighed maybe 800 kilograms.&#x201D; Contrary to government announcements, the situation, he says, has not improved. The struggle with shells is just one striking case study in the broader reality of Ukrainian manufacturing of traditional weapons. As for armored vehicles and tanks, local production is too often just refurbishment of Soviet-era equipment. And indeed Ukrainian local war vehicle makers like Ukrainian Armor have converted their factories to produce shells. A representative for the Strategic Industries Ministry declined to comment, other than to describe the shell industry as &#x201C;sensitive.&#x201D; Kotliarov was more forthcoming. &#x201C;Without (U.S.) assistance, we cannot survive,&#x201D; said Kotliarov. The mishmash of shells from different countries and eras required Artem&#x2019;s team to empty, weigh, and reapportion gunpowder between them in various warehouses near the front. Gunpowder is a key issue. A global arms race in response to Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine has led nations to scrape the bottom of the powder barrel. As one example, General Dynamics&#x2019; ordnance subsidiary, among the largest ammunition manufacturers in the world, said in its February annual report that it plans to grow its potential powder production from 5 million to 16 million pounds by 2028. Ukraine makes none of its own powder, despite tentative experiments to grow cotton to turn into powder.

(Vincenzo Circosta / Anadolu via Getty Images)So while local shell producers have emerged, they&#x2019;re limited. Steel Hornets, for instance, produces the empty casings for shells, but leaves it up to soldiers receiving the shells to fill them, a representative told the Kyiv Independent. While Western nations have given Ukraine much of their old arms stockpiles, it&#x2019;s been less generous with raw materials that Ukrainian industry could use to make its own equipment. &#x201C;Western countries are not interested in supplying raw materials,&#x201D; says Kateryna Bondar, a Ukrainian fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. &#x201C;They see a market for European defense companies in Ukraine.&#x201D; On the plus side for Ukraine, Russian equipment is riddled with many identical problems &#x2014; Soviet flotsam and jetsam rehabbed and presented as something shiny and new. On the downside, Russia&#x2019;s top-down arms industry is nonetheless producing traditional military gear at a scale that Ukraine simply cannot match. The growth of the Ukrainian defense industry has also depended on foreign money. Information Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration released in its twilight hours claimed that the U.S. had put over $2 billion into Ukraine&#x2019;s much-vaunted domestic drone industry. At Davos, Zelensky continued to plead for foreign money into Ukrainian drones as key to Europe&#x2019;s future security. The U.S. weapons supply is at risk of crumbling, calling into question Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to defend itself unaided. &#x201C;I think the general intention and idea is to cut off any military support,&#x201D; Bondar says, describing the Trump administration&#x2019;s posture toward Ukraine. The fault is far from Ukraine&#x2019;s alone. The EU and the U.S. are failing to keep up with collective quotas. Despite having an economy less than a tenth the size of either the U.S. or EU, Russia is still outproducing the entire West in key areas like ammunition for artillery. Western arms giants ranging from the German Rheinmetall to the U.S. Northrop Grumman have announced factory agreements to set up production inside of Ukraine. Their output within Ukraine is questionable. Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger, last year the subject of a foiled Russian assassination attempt, told German news outlet DW that the firm&#x2019;s 155mm factories in Ukraine won&#x2019;t be up and running until 2026. 155 mm artillery shells that are ready to be shipped are stored at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, U.S. on April 12, 2023. (Hannah Beier/Getty Images)That&#x2019;s not to say all of Ukraine&#x2019;s weapon localization is stalled or glitching. The wartime birth of local mass production of technological weapons, especially drones, electronic warfare, and communications systems has been impressive &#x2014; and vitally useful. But when it comes to high-tech traditional weapons like long-range missiles, Ukraine remains in a bind, partially because it is dependent on a goodwill supply of Western components like high-end inertial guidance modules or jet engines that Russia gets from China or via sanctions evasion. On the plus side, the U.S. may well have overestimated its own weapons deliveries to Ukraine, meaning that they make up a smaller proportion of existing arms. And at least politically, the EU remains more supportive of Ukraine than the new Trump administration, and European leaders are at least talking about escalating their own weapons production as U.S. protection looks less stable. But the largest economies of the EU have been slow to deliver on promised military industry expansion and have run through much of their pre-2022 stockpiles. That&#x2019;s especially true from neighbors from the former USSR or broader Warsaw Pact, who have been proportionately the most generous to Ukraine and who, like Ukraine, had Soviet weaponry lying around. Ukrainians consequently fear a pending cliff in weapons deliveries from both the U.S. and EU. The question is what Ukraine can and can&#x2019;t make on its own. &#x201C;I think Ukraine is very far away from being self-sufficient because the front line is huge, and the adversary is powerful and backed up by China,&#x201D; says Bondar. &#x201C;Ukraine is not able to sustain and not able to defend itself.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/we-cannot-survive-without-us-weapons-ukrainian-soldiers-cast-doubt-on-local-arms-industry/	2025-02-20T11:40:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2195734247.jpg
How Ukraine should deal with Trump, according to Ukrainians	Despite a long history of controversial and bombastic statements, U.S. President Donald Trump still managed to stun those watching this week by calling President Volodymyr Zelesnky a &quot;dictator&quot; and blaming Ukraine for Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Trump&apos;s comments were the latest example of increasingly hostile rhetoric towards Ukraine that has, in recent days, become disturbingly close to long-standing Kremlin propaganda lines. As well as the dictator comment, Trump has also criticized Zelensky for not holding elections, echoing comments from Moscow that have questioned the president&apos;s legitimacy. All of this has come at the same time as a concerted push from the White House to end the war, which so far has taken the form of a high-level meeting in Saudi Arabia between U.S. and Russian officials &#x2014; but not Ukraine&apos;s, adding to increasing fears that a peace negotiation could be reached that would be beneficial to Moscow at the expense of Kyiv. On the streets of Kyiv on Feb. 19, opinions about Trump and his outbursts over recent days weren&apos;t hard to find. &quot;It&apos;s complete nonsense. I think he&apos;s either an idiot, or he&apos;s pretending to be one,&quot; Yevhen, a charity fund employee told the Kyiv Independent. While blunt, the comment does highlight an important question &#x2014; are Trump&apos;s personal attacks on Zelensky and Ukraine just that, or is there a wider strategy at play? Benjamin Tallis, director of the Berlin-based Democratic Strategy Initiative, told the Kyiv Independent he believes there are three options. The first, he says, is a strategy all about &quot;putting the Europeans on notice.&quot; &quot;Saying, you need to toughen up, you need to take responsibility and to actually make a point in a way that has not been made before by effectively abandoning Europe,&quot; he said, adding this possibility is &quot;looking increasingly unlikely&quot; and Trump&apos;s cosying up to Putin suggests something else. The second option could be that the Trump administration is looking at the wider geo-political situation, identifies China as its biggest threat, and is therefore trying to &quot;split off Russia from China, to use Russia against China in the ongoing geopolitical competition.&quot; &quot;But the thing that mitigates against that is it seems strange on many levels to embrace such an unreliable potential partner as Russia when you have what would be a much more obvious partner and a richer partner in Europe,&quot; he says. Which leaves option three &#x2014; that Trump has &quot;moved over to the side, or embraced his position on the side of the dictators and the anti-freedom axis.&quot; &quot;And that&apos;s the nightmare scenario because that means that if Europe is in a systemic competition of free world versus the authoritarians of democracies versus dictatorships, we&apos;re basically on our own,&quot; Tallis said. Marci Shore, author and professor of European intellectual history at Yale University, gave a similarly downbeat assessment of the situation, bluntly stating that &quot;we&apos;re staring into a nihilist abyss.&quot; &quot;There are no first principles, no values, nothing beyond narcissism. Trump and Putin are alike in that the lives of other people mean absolutely nothing to them &#x2014; which gives them both a free hand,&quot; she told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Ukrainians &#x2014; and Zelensky personally &#x2014; should absolutely not count on and not trust us now &#x2014; this American administration is unpredictable, unreliable, and unhinged. This applies both domestically and globally. I say this as an American filled with shame and disgust.&quot; We asked three Ukrainian political experts how they think Ukraine should handle this very delicate, and hugely consequential moment. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks after signing two executive orders in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S. on Feb. 14, 2025. (Andrew Harnik / Getty Images)Dr. Volodymyr Dubovyk Expert on U.S.-Ukrainian relations and head of Odesa National University&apos;s Center for International Studies I do not believe that this is some sort of sophisticated strategy here on Trump&#x2019;s part. It is just Trump being Trump. He can&#x2019;t stand anyone opposing him, or standing in his way. Zelensky saying that Trump is wrong, even when he says that in the most reserved, polite way is bad enough for Trump. Only flattery works with him, but this is not a time for flattery if you are Ukraine&#x2019;s leader. Besides, he has a history with Ukraine and Zelensky, and that is a negative history. He is surrounded by people who have no regard for Ukraine. He is getting his view of Ukraine from people who wish it ill. Initially, I suppose, Trump tried to appear fair and balanced. But he has a bad temper and no patience, so his intrinsic thinking came to the surface really quickly. Zelensky is in a hard bind here &#x2014; he cannot not react to Trump&#x2019;s insinuations. Besides, he needs to position himself clearly with Ukraine&#x2019;s interests in the current situation, in light of a high-speed rapprochement with Moscow. On the other hand, of course, he does not want to antagonize Trump. That is why he appears animated and emotional, but still doing his best to be reserved and calm, not to cross certain lines. It would be wise, I think, for President Zelensky not to dive into this vicious cycle of back-and-forth mocking and poking, trading accusations. Perhaps, not all things Trump says call for a reproach. Expert on North American policy at the foreign policy think tank Ukrainian Prism When Zelensky and Trump first met in the US&#x2026; he was very praising of Trump. He was a good friend to him. So basically, Zelensky got it right on how to talk to Trump. And I do believe he should return to the strategy of interpersonal communication, of building bridges with Trump, of being his good buddy. First and foremost, we should once again make it personal, but on the good side of Trump. So to some extent, we should play by Trump&apos;s playbook. Of course, some may say it&apos;s a lame game to play, but if it provides weapons for Ukraine, if it provides security for Ukraine, and if it provides guarantees and a good deal for Ukraine, I don&apos;t care what means we use, we should save our country. The second point is don&apos;t look weak. Trump will never deal with somebody who is weak, who is losing, who is getting prepared to lose, or who is just giving up on all positions. It&apos;s not about being only nice. It&apos;s also about being a strong partner on whom Trump can rely, both economically, politically, security-wise, etc. We should play all our cards well. We should present all our pluses, especially the security and military ones. Ukraine should use all the pluses that Ukraine has and then just work, work, work, constant communication, constant exchanges, and just be there, just be present in Trump&apos;s informational bubble. Research advisor at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation If Trump believes Putin is ready to make peace and start negotiations, there is a high probability that because of the Russian approach &#x2014; they are not flexible and will try to push, push, push &#x2014; it may create a backlash from the United States, including from Trump himself. And as we know, Trump can always change his mind on matters. Right now he looks very disappointed by Zelensky, and is very aggressive towards him, repeating Russian arguments. But we don&apos;t know what will happen in one or two months&apos; time. So he may change his approach, and his approach to Russia may become harder, he may listen more carefully to Ukrainian arguments. It&apos;s very difficult to predict, frankly speaking. We can only hope.	https://kyivindependent.com/how-ukraine-should-deal-with-trump-according-to-ukrainians/	2025-02-20T11:39:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199467761.jpg
Zelensky-Kellogg meeting ends with no joint statements at US request, spokesperson says	President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, in Kyiv on Feb. 20. &quot;We discussed in detail the situation on the battlefield and how to return all our POWs (prisoners of war), as well as effective security guarantees,&quot; the president said on Telegram after the meeting. According to Zelensky, Ukraine is ready for a strong, beneficial agreement with the U.S. regarding investments and security. &quot;We have proposed the quickest and most constructive way to achieve results,&quot; he said. The meeting in Kyiv was expected to be followed by a press briefing, but Washington requested that no joint statements be made, Zelensky&apos;s spokesperson, Serhii Nykyforov, told reporters. Kellogg arrived in Ukraine on Feb. 19 as part of Washington&apos;s efforts to broker a resolution to Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Upon arrival, he said his primary mission was to &quot;listen&quot; to Kyiv&apos;s concerns and relay his findings to the White House. The visit follows U.S.-Russia negotiations in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, where American and Russian officials discussed the war without Ukrainian participation. Zelensky strongly rejected the idea of peace talks being conducted behind Ukraine&apos;s back. Zelensky&apos;s meeting with Kellogg comes amid growing tensions between Kyiv and Washington, as Trump has made several false remarks about Ukraine in recent days, including calling Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and accusing him of refusing to hold elections. His claims ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. During his visit to Ukraine, Kellogg also met with top Ukrainian military and government officials. Kellogg&apos;s role in Trump&apos;s peace efforts remains unclear, as he was not involved in the Feb. 18 talks in Saudi Arabia. Some experts suggest he has been sidelined due to his perceived pro-Ukraine stance and alleged Russian objections to his participation. Trump&apos;s recent remarks have raised concerns in Kyiv and among European allies about Washington&apos;s shifting stance on the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-kellogg-talks-end-with-no-joint-statements-at-us-request-spokesperson-says/	2025-02-20T10:21:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200011457.jpg
Ukraine needs to 'tone it down,' sign US minerals deal, Waltz says	U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz on Feb. 20 urged Kyiv to &quot;tone down&quot; its stance and sign a minerals deal that President Volodymyr Zelensky refused to make. &quot;They need to tone it down and take a hard look and sign that deal,&quot; Waltz told Fox News, referring to the memorandum presented by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Feb. 12. Kyiv had earlier announced that it was not ready to sign the U.S.-proposed agreement on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources. Zelensky said Ukraine is open to investment but argued that the memorandum lacks concrete security guarantees. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration reportedly seeks a 50% interest in Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas, and stakes in ports and other critical infrastructure through a joint investment fund. Waltz said Ukraine&apos;s rejection of the deal and resistance to Trump&apos;s approach to peace talks is &quot;completely unacceptable.&quot; Zelensky earlier reiterated his commitment to ending Russia&apos;s war in 2025, emphasizing the need for a resolution that is &quot;not just quick but fair and reliable.&quot; Trump has made multiple false statements about Ukraine in recent days, including calling Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and claiming that he refuses to hold elections. His remarks ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. U.S. Vice President JD Vance also criticized Zelensky on Feb. 19, saying his public remarks about Trump were &quot;counterproductive.&quot; The comment came after Zelensky dismissed Trump&apos;s claim that his support among Ukrainians had fallen to 4%, calling it Russian disinformation. A poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published on Feb. 19 showed that 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky, a five-point increase since December. Trump&apos;s recent remarks have sparked concerns in Kyiv and among European allies over a shift in his administration&apos;s stance on the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-needs-to-tone-down-sign-us-minerals-deal-waltz-says/	2025-02-20T10:04:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193394562.jpg
Confused about Zelensky’s legitimacy? Here’s what you need to know	U.S. President Donald Trump claimed on Feb. 19 that President Volodymyr Zelensky was a &quot;modestly successful comedian&quot; turned &quot;dictator&quot; who &quot;refused to have elections.&quot; This was the latest in a series of false accusations Trump has made about Ukraine while his team is engaging in peace negotiations with Russia, a country that wages a war of aggression against Ukraine. Trump&apos;s words led Ukraine&apos;s European allies to reaffirm their support for Zelensky and address that they see him as the legitimate president of Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized that Zelensky was Ukraine&apos;s &quot;democratically elected leader.&quot; It is &quot;perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during wartime as the U.K. did during World War II,&quot; the readout of Starmer&apos;s call with Zelensky on Feb. 19 said. We&apos;ve collected our articles and videos to help you understand why Zelensky&apos;s legitimacy is being questioned and how that plays into Russia&apos;s hands. The Kremlin has long sought to portray Zelensky as &quot;illegitimate&quot; in an attempt to discredit Kyiv. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 18 that Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has ruled Russia for over 20 years, is ready for talks with Zelensky, but &quot;legal aspects related to his legitimacy&quot; must be considered. Ukraine&apos;s allies had generally ignored this propaganda narrative until Trump appeared to echo the Kremlin&apos;s lines. Watch this video on our YouTube channel to understand why Russia is using this narrative: No, Zelensky did not cancel elections. The reason why Ukraine has not had elections during Russia&apos;s full-scale war is because they cannot be held under martial law. Martial law in Ukraine was declared on Feb 24., 2022, hours after Russia launched its full-scale invasion. Moreover, Ukrainian law requires an election to be safe, equal, and uninterrupted. This is impossible during a full-scale war, with Russia continuing to attack civilians and civic infrastructure. Read our guide to any potential elections in Ukraine: Zelensky was elected democratically in the 2019 Ukrainian presidential elections, winning 73% of the vote and beating then-incumbent President Petro Poroshenko. &#x201C;The presidential election was competitive and fundamental freedoms were generally respected,&#x201D; election observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) declared at the time. &quot;Ukraine is a democracy. Putin&apos;s Russia is not,&quot; European Commission spokesperson Stefan de Keersmaecker said on Feb. 20. Watch our video to learn about Zelensky&apos;s 2019 election campaign and how he came to power: If Ukraine had not been under martial law, Ukraine&apos;s next presidential election would have been held on March 31, 2024, and Zelensky&#x2019;s term would have ended on May 20, 2024. Read this article from May 2024 to understand why Zelensky stayed on as Ukraine&apos;s president past that date: According to a survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published on Feb. 19, around 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky as of February, marking an increase of five percentage points since December, when his approval rating polled at 52%. The day before, Trump claimed that Zelensky was down to a 4% approval rating. Trust in Zelensky skyrocketed after Russia launched its full-scale invasion and he remained in Kyiv to lead the country&apos;s fight. His approval rating began to drop in 2024 as the battlefield stalemate gave way to grinding Russian advances.

Explosion kills Russian occupation official in Berdiansk, Ukraine's intelligence claims	An explosion in Russian-occupied Berdiansk on Feb. 20 killed Yevgeny Bogdanov, deputy head of the local occupation administration, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) claimed. The intelligence agency accused him of committing multiple war crimes against Ukrainian citizens. Bogdanov oversaw financial management for the occupation administration and coordinated the construction of fortifications in Russian-occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia Oblast. A gray Renault Duster exploded and burned completely, according to HUR. Bogdanov was inside the vehicle, the agency claimed. Bogdanov reportedly arrived in Berdiansk immediately after Moscow&apos;s troops occupied the city in early 2022 and was appointed to the local administration on orders from Russian special services. Berdiansk, a key transport hub on the Azov Sea, remains strategically important for Russia, particularly for shipping looted Ukrainian grain and resources. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, multiple assassinations of Russian-appointed officials and military commanders in occupied Ukraine have been reported, often involving car bombs. In December, Vasyl Nechet, the Russian-installed head of Berdiansk, was injured in a similar car explosion. In October, Russian Major Dmitry Pervukha was killed in occupied Luhansk under similar circumstances.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-occupation-official-killed-in-berdiansk-ukraines-hur-accuses-him-of-war-crimes/	2025-02-20T08:48:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1242319542.jpg
Ukraine moves to nationalize Ferrexpo's mining subsidiary	Ukraine&apos;s State Bureau of Investigation and Justice Ministry are preparing to nationalize Poltava Mining, a subsidiary of London-listed Ferrexpo, which is majority owned by oligarch Konstantin Zhevago, the SBI announced on Feb. 20. The move comes amid Ukraine&apos;s broader crackdown on assets linked to sanctioned oligarchs during wartime. Ferrexpo is one of the country&apos;s largest iron ore exporters and employers in central Ukraine. The lawsuit seeks to transfer 49.5% of Poltava Mining and its assets to state ownership, including 541 properties, 172 land plots, and over 2,300 railway cars with tracks. Half of Ferrexpo&apos;s shares belong to Zhevago, who was arrested in absentia in July 2024 on embezzlement charges of Hr 1.4 billion ($33.6 million) in a case involving Finance and Credit Bank. Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) recently announced sanctions and criminal proceedings against against a number of Ukrainian businessmen and former high-ranking officials, including Zhevago. Poltava Mining in February was also hit by a civil claim for Hr 157 billion ($3.78 billion) over illegal mining in Ukraine and the sale of waste products. &quot;Initial accusations on the illegal sale of waste products have transformed into accusations that FPM is illegally mining and selling subsoil, which is said to have caused damage to the environment,&quot; Ferrexpo said in a statement on Feb. 4. The company denied the allegations, declaring its intentions to defend its position in the Ukrainian courts. The lawsuit does not affect the company&apos;s operations, the statement said. Earlier, in September 2024, the SBI sent a case to court against seven Poltava Mining officials for illegal mining and sale of minerals worth Hr 370 million ($8.9 million).	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-moves-to-nationalize-ferrexpos-mining-subsidiary/	2025-02-20T08:08:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-680305212.jpg
EU defense commissioner pushes back against Trump	After the Trump administration accused European allies of not pulling their weight in the support for Ukraine, the Kyiv Independent sat down with the EU&apos;s first-ever defense commissioner, Andrius Kubilius, to discuss whether Europe is ready to step up. Speaking on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14, Kubilius pushed back against Washington&apos;s accusations while underscoring the strides made by the European defense industry since 2022. Nevertheless, catching up with Russia&apos;s wartime arms production remains a challenge, the commissioner warns.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-defense-commissioner-pushes-back-against-trump/	2025-02-20T07:52:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/IMG_0436.JPG
US refuses to co-sponsor UN resolution condemning Russia, resists labeling Moscow 'aggressor' in G7 statement, media report	The U.S. is refusing to co-sponsor a UN resolution marking the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, which reaffirms Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity and condemns Moscow&apos;s aggression, Reuters reported on Feb. 20, citing sources familiar with the matter. &quot;In previous years, the United States has consistently co-sponsored such resolutions in support of a just peace in Ukraine,&quot; a source told Reuters. The upcoming UN vote, considered a key indicator of global support for Ukraine, can proceed without U.S. backing but may struggle to gain widespread support in the General Assembly. The U.S. also opposed directly calling Russia the &quot;aggressor&quot; in a G7 statement marking the anniversary of the invasion, according to the Financial Times. This is the first time the U.S. has pushed back on such language. The reports follow recent diplomatic efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration to engage with Russia, as well as a number of Trump&apos;s false accusations against Ukraine and its President Volodymyr Zelensky. On Feb. 18, Secretary of State Marco Rubio led a U.S. delegation to Saudi Arabia for direct talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Trump has made several controversial statements about Ukraine in recent days, including calling President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator&quot; and falsely accusing him of refusing to hold elections. His claims ignore the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. Trump has also suggested that Ukraine should repay the U.S. for its military assistance through a deal involving the country&apos;s natural resources, claiming &#x2014; without evidence &#x2014; that Kyiv had &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a deal worth $500 billion. On Feb. 19, Zelensky said that Ukraine&apos;s wartime military expenses had totaled $320 billion, with the U.S. and EU providing a combined $200 billion in defense support. &quot;We, the people of Ukraine, (covered) $120 billion, the U.S. and the EU &#x2014; $200 billion. We are talking about arms; this is a weapons package worth $320 billion,&quot; Zelensky said in Kyiv. Trump&apos;s recent remarks have raised concerns in Kyiv and among European allies about Washington&apos;s shifting stance on the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-refuses-to-co-sponsor-un-resolution-condemning-russia-resists-g7s-language-on-moscow/	2025-02-20T07:50:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1754907256.jpg
Ceasefire likely in 2025, Ukraine's spy chief says	Ukrainian military intelligence head Kyrylo Budanov believes that Ukraine and Russia will reach a ceasefire this year, he said in an interview with Azerbaijani journalist Eynulla Fatullayev published on Feb. 18. Budanov described the situation as &quot;paradoxical&quot; since the positions of Kyiv and Moscow are drastically opposite. &quot;At the same time, I think we will reach a ceasefire this year,&quot; Budanov said. &quot;How long it will be, how effective it will be, is another question. But I think it will happen. Most of the components needed for this to happen are there.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed to mediate a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia while using increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Kyiv. A day before dubbing President Volodymyr Zelensky a &quot;dictator,&quot; he accused Ukraine on Feb. 19 of starting the war. This was preceded by a meeting of the American and Russian delegations in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 and a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which took place before Trump&apos;s call with Zelensky. No concrete decisions were announced following the U.S.-Russia talks, but Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the meeting sparked alarm in Kyiv and Europe. According to the spy chief, while the NATO membership issue remains &quot;very complicated,&#x201D; there is no other relevant format for security guarantees. He also questioned the effectiveness of deploying a peacekeeping mission to Ukraine, saying that such a step has never met expectations in other war-torn countries. Previously, Zelensky said that European partners would need to station 100,000 to 150,000 soldiers in Ukraine to effectively deter Russia. The U.K. and France are considering deploying a much smaller European-led peacekeeping force with up to 30,000 soldiers, the Telegraph reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-russia-ceasefire-can-be-reached-in-2025-budanov-says/	2025-02-20T05:54:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2156902920.jpg
Kellogg meets Sybiha, Syrskyi, Yermak during Kyiv visit	Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, met with top Ukrainian military and government officials as part of his visit to the country that began on Feb. 19. Kellogg&apos;s visit comes amid a tense atmosphere as Trump adopts increasingly hostile rhetoric toward President Volodymyr Zelensky while planning a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. On his first day in Kyiv, Kellogg met Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak, and intelligence and security chiefs, Zelensky revealed. During the meeting, Yermak stressed that Kellogg should have &quot;complete and objective information about the events on the front and about the Ukrainians&apos; ability and desire to end the war with a just and lasting peace,&quot; the Presidential Office said. On Feb. 20, Kellogg also met Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha &quot;to discuss ways toward a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s top diplomat said. &quot;I affirmed Ukraine&apos;s willingness to achieve peace through strength and our vision for the necessary steps. I also reiterated that the security of Ukraine and the transatlantic is indivisible,&quot; Sybiha said on social media. Kellogg is expected to meet Zelensky later on Feb. 20. The Ukrainian president suggested that Trump&apos;s envoy could visit the front to inspect the situation there. &quot;We understand the need for security guarantees. We understand... the importance of the sovereignty of this nation,&quot; Kellogg said after arriving in Kyiv. &quot;Part of my mission is to sit and listen and see what your concerns are,&quot; he said, adding he will relay his findings to the White House. Trump&apos;s Ukraine envoy previously met with Zelensky and other top Ukrainian officials during the Munich Security Conference to discuss the war and the U.S.-proposed memorandum on Ukraine&apos;s rare earth minerals and other resources. Recent developments indicate that Kellogg is being sidelined in Trump&apos;s peace efforts as he was not involved in the talks in Saudi Arabia held on Feb. 18. Some experts attribute this to Kellogg&apos;s pro-Ukraine stances and Russia&apos;s alleged objections to him.	https://kyivindependent.com/kellogg-meets-sybiha-syrskyi-yermak-during-kyiv-visit/	2025-02-20T05:38:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GkOwkA1XwAAtUyM.jpg
Russia claims to retake 64% of Kursk Oblast territories seized by Ukraine	Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in Kursk Oblast captured by Ukraine, senior Russian General Staff officer Sergei Rudsky said in an interview with the Russian Defense Ministry newspaper published on Feb. 20. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. According to Rudsky, Ukrainian soldiers are in control of about 500 square kilometers (193 square miles) out of 1,268 square kilometers (490 square miles) initially seized by Kyiv. The Russian general claimed that Russian troops were now advancing in Kursk Oblast in all directions, and the Ukrainian army was &quot;retreating from their positions.&quot; The Ukrainian military has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed on Feb. 18 that Russian forces had crossed into Ukrainian territory from Kursk Oblast, which Ukraine&apos;s General Staff dismissed. Despite months of being on the defensive, Ukrainian forces reportedly advanced 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in the region in a new offensive in early February. Over six months of fighting in the region, Russian casualties have reached nearly 40,000 personnel, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 6. Another 909 have been reportedly taken as prisoners of war. Ukraine is likely looking to use its foothold in Kursk Oblast as leverage in potential peace talks. Russia&apos;s forces in Kursk Oblast have been bolstered by North Korean troops, deployed last fall to help counter the Ukrainian incursion. President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that the offensive disrupted Russia&apos;s ability to carry out large-scale operations in northeastern and southern Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-regains-control-of-64-of-seized-kursk-oblast-territories-russian-general-claims/	2025-02-20T05:21:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2166312603.jpg
EU's Costa, von der Leyen to visit Kyiv on Feb. 24	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will visit Kyiv on the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale war, Costa announced on Feb. 20. The visit aims to reaffirm the EU&apos;s &quot;support to the heroic Ukrainian people and to the democratically elected President Volodymyr Zelensky,&quot; Costa said on X.	https://kyivindependent.com/eus-costa-von-der-leyen-to-visit-kyiv-on-feb-24/	2025-02-20T05:01:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2190670425.jpg
Europe, rearming is cheaper than war	Europe urgently needs to rearm. Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, and the broader threat that Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s regime poses to Europe, requires nothing less. U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s administration has also now made clear that neither Ukraine nor America&#x2019;s NATO allies can count on continued U.S. support. Perhaps this particularly brutal wake-up call will finally jolt European governments out of their complacency. If so, the big question is how to finance the requisite increase in military investment at a time when Europe&#x2019;s economies are weak, public finances are stretched, and many voters are loath to accept cuts to other government spending. The scale of the challenge is indeed daunting. Russia&#x2019;s economy is on a war footing, its army is battle-hardened, and it has a huge stockpile of nuclear weapons. Even though Europe&#x2019;s economy dwarfs Russia&#x2019;s, a recent report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies estimates that, after adjusting for purchasing power, Russia&#x2019;s military expenditure last year ($462 billion) was higher than Europe&#x2019;s ($457 billion). Europe&#x2019;s big powers have struggled to meet NATO&#x2019;s previously agreed peacetime target of spending at least 2% of GDP on defense. France and Germany managed barely more than that last year, while the United Kingdom reached 2.3% of GDP. These figures are woefully inadequate for an age when war has returned to the continent and Europe must provide for its own security. Trump wants NATO&#x2019;s European members to raise their defense spending to 5% of GDP, while NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte acknowledges the need for &#x201C;considerably more than 3%.&#x201D; Poland has already upped its military spending to over 4% of GDP, with the aim of reaching 5%, and other front-line states such as Estonia and Lithuania are not far behind it. Now the rest of Europe must follow suit. But how should they finance the effort? With European economies stagnant and many Europeans struggling, governments are not keen to raise taxes or slash welfare spending. While such measures may ultimately be necessary nonetheless, the politically obvious solution for now is to borrow. This would make economic sense, too, since higher defense spending is, in fact, an investment in Europe&#x2019;s future. True, high government debts, EU fiscal rules, and domestic political constraints make increased borrowing tricky for many countries. But there are at least three options for mitigating these factors. The first is to exclude investment in defense from the bloc&#x2019;s fiscal rules, which broadly limit government borrowing to 3% of GDP. Last year, the European Commission launched an &#x201C;excessive deficit procedure&#x201D; against Poland, which rightly argued that its increased borrowing was necessary to protect the country &#x2014; and the rest of Europe &#x2014; from the heightened Russian threat. Fortunately, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen seems to have come around to the Polish position. She is proposing to activate the Stability and Growth Pact&#x2019;s escape clause (which allows higher borrowing during crises) to permit increased defense investment. While Germany and other fiscally frugal countries have previously objected to granting such additional flexibility, that may change after the German elections on February 23, given the country&#x2019;s belated awareness of its vulnerability. Since Germany itself has low public debt and a small budget deficit, EU fiscal rules would not prevent it from borrowing more to upgrade its feeble defenses. But it is shackled by its own constitutional &#x201C;debt brake,&#x201D; which then-Chancellor Angela Merkel introduced in 2009, and which the country&#x2019;s powerful constitutional court aggressively enforces. Again, though, there could be greater openness to amending this measure after the election. Fiscal rules are not the only constraint, however; so, too, are bond markets. France&#x2019;s public debt already exceeds 110% of GDP, and its minority government has struggled to pass a budget that would trim its bulging budget deficit (6.1% of GDP). The country&#x2019;s precarious political situation has further increased the premium that it must pay relative to German debt. Indeed, the interest rate on French debt briefly exceeded that of Greece last year. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk (L), French President Emmanuel Macron (C), and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (R) at a joint meeting in Berlin, Germany, on March 15, 2024. (Christoph Soeder/picture alliance via Getty Images)A second option, then, is for European governments to borrow collectively to finance a one-off investment in defense capacity, as French President Emmanuel Macron has suggested. There is a precedent for this: the EU&#x2019;s 750 billion euro ($782 billion) COVID-19 recovery fund. Another round of joint borrowing to the tune of 500 billion euros (3% of EU GDP) could amplify member states&#x2019; defense spending, help to rationalize European defense procurement, and potentially bolster European defense firms. The hitch is that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb&#xE1;n is openly pro-Putin, while four other EU countries (Austria, Ireland, Cyprus, and Malta) have maintained their official neutrality vis-&#xE0;-vis Russia. Moreover, fiscally frugal northern European countries have hitherto been reluctant to sanction further EU borrowing. One potential workaround is for a coalition of willing governments to set up a special purpose vehicle separate from the EU, which could issue joint bonds backed by guarantees from participating governments. This would not only bypass recalcitrant EU members; it would also allow for participation by non-EU defense partners such as Norway and the U.K.. The relatively new U.K. Labour government might find this especially attractive, given its own domestic fiscal constraints. Finally, the third option is to expand the scope of European Investment Bank lending. While the EIB can already finance dual-use (civilian/military) projects, such as those producing drones and satellites, 19 EU governments recently suggested that it should also be permitted to finance wholly military spending, such as investments in tank and ammunition manufacturing. However it is financed, Europe needs to rearm now. Upping defense spending to avert Ukraine&#x2019;s defeat and deter broader Russian aggression is much less costly than fighting an all-out war. Otherwise, as Rutte warns, Europeans will need either to learn Russian or to move to New Zealand. Editor&#x2019;s Note: Copyright, Project Syndicate.

Kremlin 'concerned' by Starmer's reported peacekeeper plan for Ukraine	Moscow is worried about recent discussions by NATO countries about a potential deployment of peacekeepers in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, the pro-Kremlin news agency Interfax reported on Feb. 20. Peskov made the statement in reaction to a recent Telegraph story saying that U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer plans to propose to U.S. President Donald Trump the deployment of up to 30,000 European troops to monitor a potential ceasefire deal in Ukraine. &quot;We are, of course, following all these reports most closely... This is a cause for concern because the discussion is about sending NATO military contingents to Ukraine,&quot; Peskov said at a press briefing. The Kremlin spokesperson reiterated earlier statements by the Russian Foreign Ministry that a deployment of NATO troops on Ukrainian soil would be &quot;unacceptable&quot; for Russia. The peacekeeper deployment has been discussed as a possible security guarantee for Ukraine in case of a ceasefire. Washington has supported the idea, with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth saying that the ceasefire should be &quot;backed by capable European and non-European troops&quot;&#x2014; with the exclusion of U.S. soldiers. While France, the U.K., and several other countries voiced support for the idea, European countries have yet to reach a consensus on the issue. According to Starmer&apos;s plan, European troops would be deployed in Ukrainian cities, ports, and other critical infrastructure such as nuclear power plants &quot;far away from the current front lines,&quot; the Telegraph wrote. Starmer reportedly also plans to urge Trump to keep U.S. fighter jets and missiles in NATO countries in Eastern Europe ready to respond to any future Russian aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-concerned-by-starmers-reported-peacekeeper-plan-for-ukraine/	2025-02-20T04:00:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2159849194--1-.jpg
Ukraine behind FPV goggles explosions in Russia, source claims	A Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) operation was behind the detonations of goggles for first-person-view (FPV) drones used by Russian soldiers, a HUR source told the Kyiv Independent on Feb. 20. The news comes after Russian pro-war Telegram channels reported a series of explosions of FPV goggles while they were being used by Russian drone operators. According to the source, HUR bought a large batch of FPV goggles for the operation and rigged them with explosives and a detonation mechanism. According to the source, a large batch of FPV goggles was bought for the operation and equipped with explosives and a remote detonation function. (HUR source)According to the source, a large batch of FPV goggles was bought for the operation and equipped with explosives and a remote detonation function. (HUR source)&quot;Russian volunteers&quot; subsequently donated the goggles to Russian drone units &quot;in coordination&quot; with the agency, according to the source.&quot;Today, the horrors of war are literally happening right before the eyes of Russian FPV pilots. This is a well-deserved punishment for the war crimes that the Russian occupiers commit against Ukraine every day,&quot; the HUR source said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Throughout Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing warfare. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks by Ukrainian troops. FPV drones are cheap to manufacture and can be precisely flown into targets, allowing their users to destroy much more expensive military equipment.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-behind-fpv-goggles-explosions-in-russia-source-claims/	2025-02-20T03:21:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2190445244.jpg
Russian vessel sanctioned over North Korean arms shipments entering European waters, researchers say	The Russian munitions carrier Maia-1 passed the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean Sea as it is likely heading for the Russian port of Ust-Luga in the Baltic Sea, the Open Source Center (OSC) research group said on Feb. 19. This would mark the first time that the Russian-flagged vessel, sanctioned by the U.S. and the EU, entered European waters, the Financial Times noted. Maia-1, owned by the sanctioned MG-Flot company, has reportedly made at least nine voyages to North Korea in the past five months. North Korea has become Moscow&apos;s leading supporter in its war against Ukraine, providing artillery, shells, ballistic missiles, and over up to 12,000 soldiers for deployment in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. The MarineTraffic monitoring channel shows Maia-1 north of Egypt&apos;s Mediterranean coast and well past the Suez Canal as of Feb. 20, heading west. The content of Maia-1&apos;s cargo remains unclear. Joe Byrne, a senior OSC analyst, told the Financial Times that Maia-1&apos;s trip is meant to &quot;test&quot; the Western resolve in enforcing sanctions. Ust-Luga, Maia-1&apos;s declared destination, lies in Russia&apos;s northeastern Leningrad Oblast, only some 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the border with NATO member Estonia. The city&apos;s port has reportedly served as a key hub for Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; tankers used to avoid sanctions. Russia has also been building a new liquified natural gas (LNG) terminal at the Baltic port, though Western sanctions have hampered the process. A Ukrainian drone strike against the Ust-Luga port was reported in January, while an oil tanker exploded at the port under unclear circumstances the following month.	https://kyivindependent.com/vessel-sanctioned-over-north-korean-arms-shipments-heading-to-russias-baltic-port-researchers-say/	2025-02-20T02:57:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-478570656.jpg
Russian mass attack targets Ukraine's gas facilities, energy minister says	Russian forces targeted Ukraine&apos;s gas infrastructure in a mass drone and missile attack overnight on Feb. 20, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukrainian energy infrastructure with missiles and drones over the course of the war, including gas storage facilities in Ukraine&apos;s west. Russia launched 161 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones and 14 Kh-101/55SM cruise missiles, Kalibr/Iskander-K cruise missiles, and Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missiles against Ukraine this night, the Air Force said. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 80 drones over 11 oblasts, while 78 drones were lost without causing damage, according to the statement. The attack damaged gas production facilities, Halushchenko said, without disclosing their locations. Explosions were reported in Kyiv, Odesa, and the adjacent regions. Russian aerial strikes targeted an energy facility of Ukraine&apos;s DTEK company in Odesa Oblast. A total of 49,000 consumers remained without power as of 9 a.m. local time, Governor Oleh Kiper said. The full consequences of the Russian attack are being determined. Restoration works are ongoing. &quot;The purpose of these criminal attacks is to stop the production of gas needed to meet the household needs of citizens and centralized heating,&quot; the minister said. In early February, Halushchenko said that Russian strikes had severely impacted Ukraine&apos;s domestic gas production capacity and that the country would need to import an estimated 1 billion cubic meters of gas by the end of the year.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-gas-facilities-targeted-in-russian-mass-attack-energy-minister-says/	2025-02-20T02:04:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1228384175.jpg
Trump may seek simplified resources deal with Ukraine, Reuters reports	The Trump administration may try to push through a simplified initial version of the U.S.-Ukraine deal on natural resources extraction, with details to be sorted out at a later date, Reuters reported on Feb. 20, citing two undisclosed sources. The news comes after U.S. President Donald Trump said that he aims to &quot;resurrect&quot; talks on the agreement, adding that otherwise, &quot;things are gonna not make him (President Volodymyr Zelensky) too happy.&quot; The Trump administration reportedly seeks a 50% interest in all of Ukraine&apos;s natural resources, including critical minerals, oil, and gas, as well as stakes in port and other critical infrastructure, through a joint investment fund. In early February, Trump said he wanted to strike a deal with Ukraine involving access to rare earth minerals in exchange for continued aid. Trump later claimed that Kyiv had &quot;essentially agreed&quot; to a $500 billion resource deal. The revised approach is one of the several directions being discussed in the White House on how to strike a deal with Kyiv in the coming weeks, according to the news agency. Postponing discussion on the agreement&apos;s details should help Washington bypass numerous legal and logistical obstacles and give the U.S. time to consider issues like revenue sharing at a later stage, Reuters wrote. Sources told Reuters that Trump wants to make a deal before potentially authorizing more U.S. military aid for Kyiv or moving forward with an attempt to broker formal Ukraine-Russia peace talks. Trump considers it important to publicly announce to domestic audiences that the U.S. is getting back the money allocated for assistance, the sources claimed. An undisclosed Trump adviser confirmed for Reuters that the U.S. would continue to pursue the agreement, adding that &quot;we need to get this guy (Zelensky) back to reality.&quot; Other sources told the news agency that Ukraine is open to concluding the deal but hopes it will be less &quot;rapacious&quot; than the original draft. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent passed Zelensky a draft of the Ukraine-U.S. natural resources agreement during his visit to Kyiv last week. Ukraine&apos;s leader said Kyiv is not ready to sign the document as it did not include any security guarantees. A Ukrainian official source told the Kyiv Independent that the U.S. initially wanted to make Ukraine&apos;s signing of the memorandum a condition for Zelensky&apos;s meeting with Vice President JD Vance at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14. After Ukrainian delegates pushed back, the meeting eventually took place, during which both sides discussed their proposals. The source described the talks as constructive. Trump blamed Ukraine for treating Bessent &quot;rather rudely&quot; when he arrived in Kyiv to pen the memorandum. The comments follow Trump&apos;s increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Ukraine. Only a day before dubbing Zelensky &quot;a dictator without elections,&quot; he accused Ukraine of starting the war while praising the U.S.-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-may-try-to-make-simplified-resources-deal-with-ukraine-reuters-reports/	2025-02-20T01:55:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173926230.jpg
Russia holds 'the cards' in possible peace talks, Trump says	U.S. President Donald Trump said that Russia holds &quot;the cards&quot; in any peace talks with Ukraine as they occupy a significant part of Ukrainian territory, the BBC reported on Feb. 20. &quot;I think the Russians want to see the war end, I really do. I think they have the cards a little bit, because they&apos;ve taken a lot of territory. They have the cards,&quot; Trump told journalists on Air Force One. A U.S. delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio met top Russian officials for talks in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, marking the highest-level meeting between the two sides since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022. Ukraine was not invited to participate. No concrete decisions were announced following the U.S.-Russia talks, though both Moscow and Washington praised the meeting as constructive. Ukraine&apos;s exclusion sparked alarm in Kyiv and Europe. The U.S. and Russia signaled that a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin could occur before the end of February. Speaking after the Riyadh talks, Trump voiced his belief that Russia wishes to end the war and laid the blame for the ongoing hostilities on Ukraine. He subsequently attacked President Volodymyr Zelensky as a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; while pressing the besieged country to hold a vote. Kremlin propaganda has pushed the narrative that Zelensky is an illegitimate leader, relying on the premise that his first presidential term was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024. Trump&apos;s claim ignores the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-has-the-cards-in-possible-peace-talks-trump-says/	2025-02-20T01:04:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-872780694.jpg
Starmer to pitch plan on 30,000 European peacekeepers in Ukraine to Trump, Telegraph reports	U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer will present U.S. President Donald Trump with a plan to deploy up to 30,000 European troops in Ukraine backed by U.S. firepower, the Telegraph reported on Feb. 19, citing undisclosed Western officials. Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron are going to travel to the U.S. next week to discuss the prospects of peace negotiations with Trump. European leaders gathered in Paris on Feb. 17 for an emergency summit amid concerns that Washington is advancing peace talks with Moscow without Europe&#x2019;s involvement. A broader meeting was held on Feb. 19, after which Macron reaffirmed the &quot;united&quot; stance of France and its allies on Ukraine. Starmer is reportedly planning to reveal details of how European troops would be able to enforce any ceasefire brokered by Trump. According to the plan, European troops would be deployed in Ukrainian cities, ports, and other critical infrastructure such as nuclear power plants &quot;far away from the current front lines,&quot; the Telegraph wrote. The U.S. has ruled out sending its own troops while encouraging European allies to take the lead in securing Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability. The Western official claimed the mission would rely on &quot;technical monitoring,&quot; including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, as well as drones and satellites. They also added that sufficient firepower would support the mission to &quot;monitor and shoot those attacks down&quot; to reopen Ukraine&apos;s airspace and allow commercial flights. The purpose of this support is to ensure that &quot;whatever forces are deployed will not be challenged by Russia,&quot; a source told the newspaper. According to the Telegraph, Starmer will urge Trump to keep U.S. fighter jets and missiles in NATO countries in Eastern Europe ready to respond to any future Russian aggression. Apart from the U.K. and France, other countries remain cautious about sending their troops to Ukraine, citing concerns over the escalation and limited military resources, according to the Washington Post. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Kyiv had made significant progress in securing a foreign military presence on its territory. On Jan. 22, Zelensky said the number of European peacekeepers required to maintain peace in Ukraine would depend on the size of Ukraine&apos;s own military.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-pm-to-present-trump-plan-to-send-30-000-european-troops-to-ukraine-telegraph-reports/	2025-02-20T00:16:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2159996904.jpg
5 killed, 17 injured in Russian attacks on Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least five civilians and injured at least 17 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 20. Three people were killed and 10 injured in Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Russian forces dropped four guided aerial bombs on the city of Kostiantynivka on the morning of Feb. 19, killing two people and injuring eight while damaging 34 houses, the governor said. One civilian was also killed in Predtechyne, and two were injured in Pokrovsk, according to the statement. In Kharkiv Oblast, two men aged 59 were killed during Russian attacks against Kupiansk, while five other civilians were injured in the town and elsewhere in the region, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Two men were injured during Russian attacks against the Vasylivka and Polohy district in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, according to Governor Ivan Fedorov. Russian aerial strikes targeted an energy facility of Ukraine&apos;s DTEK company in Odesa Oblast overnight, the company announced. Governor Oleh Kiper said that 49,000 consumers remain without power as of 9 a.m. local time as repairs continue.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-128/	2025-02-19T23:58:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-20_09-44-43.jpg
Trump wants to 'resurrect' Ukraine resources deal 'or things are not gonna make (Zelensky) too happy'	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 19 that he aims to &quot;resurrect&quot; talks on the agreement for the extraction of Ukraine&apos;s rare earth minerals, CNN reported shortly after the U.S. president accused his Ukrainian counterpart of being a &quot;dictator.&quot; &quot;I think I&#x2019;m gonna resurrect that deal, you know, we&apos;ll see what happens, but I&#x2019;m gonna resurrect it, or things are gonna not make him (President Volodymyr Zelensky) too happy. And look, it&#x2019;s time for elections,&quot; Trump said, without elaborating on the consequences for Ukraine and its president if the deal is not signed. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent passed Zelensky a draft of the Ukraine-U.S. natural resources agreement during his visit to Kyiv last week. Ukraine&apos;s leader said Kyiv is not ready to sign the document as it did not include any security guarantees. &quot;There are no security guarantees,&quot; in the proposed agreement, Zelensky said during the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15, adding that signing the memorandum &quot;was not in our interest today&quot; but did not rule out the possibility of an eventual agreement with the U.S. Trump blamed Ukraine for treating Bessent &quot;rather rudely&quot; when he arrived in Kyiv to pen the memorandum. &quot;They told him no, and Zelensky was sleeping and unavailable to meet him,&quot; the U.S. president claimed. &quot;He went there to get a document signed, and when he got there, he came back empty. They wouldn&#x2019;t sign the document.&quot; Trump did not specify what the terms of the deals could be and how Ukraine could benefit from them. The U.S. is looking to obtain 50% of Ukraine&apos;s rare earth minerals, NBC reported on Feb. 15. Washington has signaled openness to deploy American troops to guard these resources if there is a deal with Russia to end the war, undisclosed American officials told the outlet. Trump said in early February that he wanted to strike a deal with Ukraine involving access to rare earth minerals in exchange for continued aid.

European leaders back Zelensky after Trump's accusations	A number of European leaders on Feb. 19 reaffirmed their support for President Volodymyr Zelensky after U.S. President Donald Trump accused him of being a &quot;dictator&quot; and espousing false claims about Ukraine. &quot;Ukraine has been defending itself against Russia&apos;s merciless war of aggression for almost three years... And it is simply wrong and dangerous to deny President Zelensky&apos;s democratic legitimacy,&quot; German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on X. In his post on the Truth Social platform, Trump accused the Ukrainian president of refusing to hold elections and warned that &quot;Zelensky better move fast, or he won&#x2019;t have a country left.&quot; The U.S. president also falsely claimed that Washington had provided Ukraine with $350 billion in support and that Zelensky had an approval rating of 4%. The Ukrainian president refuted both claims earlier the same day, saying that Trump is trapped in a &quot;disinformation space.&quot; &quot;How do you organize elections with one-fifth of your territory occupied and under daily strikes across the country? Calling the president of such a country dictator requires a great deal of cynicism,&quot; Czech President Petr Pavel said. Kremlin propaganda has pushed the narrative that Zelensky is an illegitimate leader, relying on the premise that his first presidential term was originally meant to end on May 20, 2024. But Trump&apos;s claim ignores the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. As a result, Zelensky&apos;s term has been extended, which constitutional lawyers argue is permitted under Ukrainian law. French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who are visiting Washington next week to discuss peace negotiations and support for Ukraine with Trump, also reiterated their support for Zelensky in phone calls. &quot;The Prime Minister (Keir Starmer) expressed his support for President Zelensky as Ukraine&#x2019;s democratically elected leader and said that it was perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during wartime as the U.K. did during World War II,&quot; the readout of Starmer&apos;s call with Zelensky said. In the wake of Trump&apos;s comments, Finnish President Alexander Stubb tried to ease the tension and warned against &quot;hysteria.&quot; &quot;Finland supports Ukraine by all possible means. Finland supports the Ukrainian constitution and the democratically elected President Volodymyr Zelensky,&quot; Stubb said. &quot;The war of aggression was started solely by Russia and (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin. Our job is to have a discussion with Trump about what the consequences are if Putin gets his way.&quot; Trump&apos;s latest comments follow his increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Ukraine. Only a day before dubbing Zelensky a &quot;dictator without elections,&quot; he accused Ukraine of starting and continuing the war while praising the U.S.-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia. Recent statements from Washington have prompted European leaders to seek a united strategy for ensuring Ukraine&apos;s continued defense. European leaders gathered in Paris on Feb. 17 for an emergency summit amid concerns that the U.S. is advancing peace talks with Russia without Europe&#x2019;s involvement.

Macron, Starmer to visit Washington next week as they reaffirm support for Ukraine in calls with Zelensky	French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer will visit Washington next week to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump, Fox News reported on Feb. 19. The three leaders will discuss peace negotiations prospects to end Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine, U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said on Fox News. He described recent talks with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia as a &quot;positive step&#x201D; and mentioned the ongoing discussions in Kyiv and at the Munich Security Conference. Waltz also urged European nations to take a more &#x201C;active role&#x201D; in ensuring Ukraine&#x2019;s security. &#x201C;We welcome Europe. We&#x2019;ve been asking for years for Europe to step up and contribute more to not only their own defense but Ukraine&#x2019;s defense,&#x201D; he said. Ahead of their trip, both leaders spoke with President Volodymyr Zelensky, who highlighted the need for strong security guarantees to ensure lasting peace in Europe. Zelensky discussed Macron&#x2019;s recent talks with world leaders and reaffirmed Ukraine&#x2019;s aligned position with France. &quot;I had a great conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron. He shared details of his recent talks with world leaders. Europe needs a reliable and lasting peace&#x2014;one that can only be ensured and built on strong security guarantees. France values freedom just as much as we do. Thank you for your support,&quot; Zelensky wrote on X. In a separate conversation, the Ukrainian president emphasized the U.K.&#x2019;s crucial role in strengthening European security, expressing gratitude for London&apos;s continued support. &quot;I spoke with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The United Kingdom&#x2019;s role in fortifying Europe&#x2019;s defense and security is important for us. We discussed upcoming plans and opportunities. The U.K.&#x2019;s support matters indeed, and we will never forget the respect the British people have shown for Ukraine and our citizens,&quot; Zelensky wrote.

Sanctions remain vital for maintaining international pressure on Russia, Deputy PM says	Sanctions against Russia remain a key tool of international pressure, Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna said on Feb. 19. &quot;The majority of sanctions, including almost all sovereign assets of the Russian Federation, are frozen specifically in the territory and jurisdictions of the European Union. Therefore, this is precisely the moment when we understand that this is not a reversible issue,&quot; she said to RBC-Ukraine at the opening of the Ukraine&apos;s Path to the EU in Illustrations, Posters, and Artworks exhibition. Stefanishyna noted that Russia raising the issue of sanctions was unsurprising, as it had used similar leverage during negotiations over the Black Sea grain corridor agreement. She expressed uncertainty regarding the position of the U.S. and its next steps, but appeared confident in the EU&#x2019;s commitment to upholding sanctions. &quot;I am confident regarding the European Union. But, in principle, if we take into account the official statements of the US, particularly after the so-called consultations that took place (between the US and Russia), they did not appear radical,&quot; she said. EU envoys approved the 16th package of sanctions against Russia on Feb. 19, and the measures are set to be officially endorsed by EU ministers on Feb. 24, the third anniversary of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The newest sanctions package will target aluminum imports and the &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of oil tankers, referring to aging and poorly insured ships Russia uses to avoid sanctions on the oil trade.	https://kyivindependent.com/sanctions-remain-vital-for-maintaining-international-pressure-on-russia-deputy-pm-says/	2025-02-19T20:27:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2150526931.jpg
Russian court issues first prison sentence under ‘LGBT extremism’ law	A district court in Kemerovo Oblast has issued Russia&#x2019;s first prison sentence under the country&#x2019;s ban on the so-called &#x201C;international LGBT movement,&#x201D; independent Russian outlet Mediazona reported on Feb. 19. The individual, who had been serving a prior prison sentence, was convicted of &#x201C;LGBT extremism&#x201D; and sentenced to six years in a maximum-security facility, with their total sentence adjusted to 15 years. Authorities accused them of &#x201C;involving&#x201D; Russian citizens in the banned &#x201C;international LGBT movement&#x201D; while serving their time. The court&apos;s ruling is the first prison sentence issued under this law, but on Jan. 29, a court in Nizhny Novgorod sentenced a woman to serve five days in administrative detention under this legislation for the crime of wearing frog-shaped earrings that displayed the image of a rainbow. Then, on Feb. 1, a court in Volgograd Oblast found a defendant known as Artyom P. guilty after he posted a picture of an LBGT flag online and ordered him to pay a fine of 1,000 rubles ($11.05). In November 2023, the Russian Supreme Court&apos;s decision to label the &quot;international LGBT movement&quot; as &quot;extremist&quot; has starkly intensified the challenges faced by the LGBTQ+ community in general within the country. This ruling, emerging from a lawsuit by the Justice Ministry accusing the LGBT movement of inciting social and religious discord, has effectively jeopardized all forms of LGBTQ+ rights activism and expression in Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-court-issues-first-prison-sentence-under-lgbt-extremism-law/	2025-02-19T18:21:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-831141052.jpg
Belarus exports rapeseed oil from occupied Ukrainian territories to EU, RFE/RL investigation finds	The Belarusian company Agroproduct has been using raw materials from Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine&#x2019;s southern Kherson Oblast to produce rapeseed oil, which it then exported to the European Union. An investigation by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&apos;s (RFE/RL) Schemes&apos; in collaboration with journalists from Lithuania, Latvia, and Belarus, uncovered the supply chain that bypasses existing trade restrictions. Despite a mid-2024 ban on Belarusian food imports, including rapeseed oil, one of the key destinations for Agroproduct&#x2019;s shipments is Lithuania. Data from Russia&#x2019;s state information system Zerno shows that in 2023, Belarus imported nearly 5,000 tons of rapeseed from occupied Kherson, with five companies, including Agroproduct, receiving these shipments. According to Eurostat, EU nations purchased over 90,000 tons of rapeseed oil from Belarus in the first half of 2024, amounting to approximately &#x20AC;67 million. Alongside Lithuania, Latvia has also been identified as a key buyer. The Belarusian opposition group &quot;Community of Railway Workers of Belarus&quot; claims that around 50,000 tons of rapeseed oil exported to these countries last year came solely from Agroproduct. Agroproduct has not been subjected to either European or Ukrainian sanctions. This means the company can not only sell oil to the EU but also purchase rapeseed from European and Ukrainian farmers. Latvian and Lithuanian logistics firms confirmed their cooperation with Agroproduct during conversations with journalists, further linking the company to the illicit trade. Investigators also discovered connections between Agroproduct and the Belarusian government. The company&#x2019;s director, Oleg Teslyuk, has openly boasted about his ties to state authorities but refused to comment on whether the rapeseed used in production was sourced from occupied Ukrainian territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-exports-rapeseed-oil-from-occupied-kherson-to-eu-rfe-rl-investigation-finds/	2025-02-19T15:24:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2151234308.jpg
