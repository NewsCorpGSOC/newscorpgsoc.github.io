Russia hasn't received requests from foreign companies seeking to return, Medvedev says	Moscow has not received official requests from foreign companies seeking to return to Russia after exiting due to the Russia-Ukraine war and sanctions, Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chairman of Russia&apos;s Security Council and former president, told state-owned news agency TASS on March 20. &#x201C;No one has officially applied yet. So, they are informally probing the ground,&#x201D; Medvedev claimed. His statement follows Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s directive to the Cabinet of Ministers to prepare for the return of Western companies, emphasizing that Russian firms should have &quot;certain advantages&quot; over those re-entering the market. The decision comes as relations between Russia and the U.S. show signs of rapprochement. The Kremlin said on March 18 that U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin are developing &quot;mutually beneficial cooperation&quot; in several areas as part of efforts to normalize relations between the two countries. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, hundreds of Western companies have withdrawn from the Russian market, unwilling to contribute to the country&apos;s economy or war effort. According to the Kyiv School of Economics Institute, 472 foreign firms have fully exited, while another 1,360 have scaled down their operations. Medvedev insisted that Russia did not force foreign companies out, claiming they left &quot;under pressure from their governments&quot; and &quot;out of fear.&quot; The former president warned that any firms looking to return should expect &quot;a separate conversation&quot; and that those who stay out permanently are of no concern to Moscow. Despite intensified diplomatic contacts between Washington and Moscow over the war in Ukraine, no major Western companies have publicly indicated plans to return to Russia. The Kremlin has made it difficult for departing businesses by requiring government approval, imposing a mandatory 50% discount on asset sales, and enforcing a 10% &quot;exit tax.&quot; Russian authorities have also seized assets from subsidiaries of foreign companies that continued operating in the country. These restrictions are widely viewed as retaliation for Western sanctions, including the freezing of approximately $300 billion in Russian central bank assets. While some companies have found ways to continue limited operations in Russia through intermediaries or licensing agreements, large-scale reentry remains unlikely under current geopolitical conditions.	https://kyivindependent.com/moscow-has-received-no-requests-from-firms-seeking-to-return-medvedev-says/	2025-03-20T04:35:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1151696599.jpg
$5.4 billion on ammunition for Ukraine 'realistic' goal, EU's top diplomat says	The EU is working on providing Ukraine with 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion) for ammunition, top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas said on March 20, as a much larger 40-billion-euro ($43 billion) package still lacks consensus. Speaking to journalists ahead of an EU summit in Brussels, Kallas called the 5-billion-euro tranche a &quot;realistic plan&quot; that is currently under discussion. Despite Kallas saying earlier this week that the tranche of 40 billion euros has &#xA0;&quot;broad political support&quot; among EU members, some countries, such as Italy, France or Spain, remain hesitant. Additional European assistance is ever more crucial for Kyiv now as future support from the U.S., the leading military donor, grows increasingly uncertain under President Donald Trump. The sum of 5 billion euros for purchasing 2 million large-caliber ammunition rounds is seen as a first step that could be achieved before a possible consensus on the more significant tranche. EU officials have been discussing ways to move the bigger package forward, including basing contributions on consent to avoid a likely veto by Hungary, the bloc&apos;s most Russian-friendly country. The contributions are to be based on each member state&apos;s gross national income (GNI), which has also become a key sticking point in the discussions. &quot;Some countries have done more, and some countries are bigger economies,&quot; Kallas said. Some of the EU&apos;s smaller members, such as Denmark, Estonia, Lithuania, or Latvia, have committed considerably greater shares of their national GDP to support Ukraine than some larger economies like France, Spain, or Italy. &quot;In the short term, we have to support Ukraine, and it&apos;s absolutely obvious that Ukraine needs our military assistance; Ukraine needs ammunition, long-range missiles, and we are ready to provide it,&quot; Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said after arriving at the summit. European leaders have gathered for a two-day summit in Brussels to discuss support for Ukraine and ways to boost defense spending. President Volodymyr Zelensky is scheduled to deliver an online address to the summit on March 20.	https://kyivindependent.com/5-4-billion-on-ammuniton-for-ukraine-realistic-goal-eus-top-diplomat-says/	2025-03-20T04:26:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2205361033.jpg
Kharkiv's Faktor Druk printing house fully restored after Russian missile attack	The Faktor Druk printing house in Kharkiv, heavily damaged by a Russian missile attack in 2024, has been fully restored, First Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko announced on March 20. Russian forces struck the printing facility on May 23, killing seven people and injuring 21. The attack destroyed more than 50,000 books and vital printing equipment. Faktor Druk is part of the Faktor Group, which includes Vivat, Ukraine&apos;s third-largest publishing house. The Faktor Druk printing house in Kharkiv, heavily damaged by a Russian missile attack in 2024, has been fully restored, photo published on March 20, 2025. (Yulia Svyrydenko / Facebook)&quot;A year ago, a Russian attack destroyed a printing house in Kharkiv. I remember how Serhii Polituchyi (the printing plant&apos;s owner) brought burnt children&apos;s books &#x2014; the same ones my daughter reads &#x2014; and it just broke my heart,&quot; Svyrydenko wrote on Facebook. The restoration of the facility was financed by the Howard G. Buffett Foundation, which stepped in following the attack to help rebuild critical infrastructure. &quot;Then we looked for help. Howard Buffett (U.S. philanthropist) was the first to respond: &apos;We will rebuild.&apos; And today, here is a photo of the restored shop,&quot; Svyrydenko added. Faktor Druk is one of the largest full-cycle printing complexes in Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/kharkivs-faktor-druk-printing-house-fully-restored-after-russian-missile-attack/	2025-03-20T03:35:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2154319563.jpg
Zelensky arrives in Norway for talks with Norwegian PM	President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Oslo on March 20 to hold talks with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere, the Norwegian government said. &quot;I look forward to constructive discussions on how Norway can best provide assistance to Ukraine in both the short term and the long term,&quot; Stoere said in a statement. The visit comes ahead of Zelensky&apos;s scheduled online address to the European summit later the same day. Also on March 20, the U.K. is hosting military leaders from over 20 countries to discuss a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine within the so-called &quot;coalition of the willing.&quot; &quot;Norway supports Ukraine in its fight to defend itself and is contributing to the effort to achieve a lasting, just peace in the country,&quot; Norway&apos;s prime minister noted. Stoere and Zelensky will hold a series of meetings on March 20. Norwegian Finance Minister Jens Stoltenberg, Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide, and Defense Minister Tore Sandvik are also scheduled to meet members of Zelensky&apos;s delegation during the visit. Norway has supported Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Earlier this month, Norwegian parliamentary leaders agreed to increase aid for Ukraine by 50 billion Norwegian krone ($4.6 billion) to a total of 85 billion Norwegian krone ($7.8 billion) in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-arrives-in-norway-for-talks-with-norwegian-pm/	2025-03-20T03:03:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1620259298.jpeg
Shoigu claims Ukraine's Constitution 'obstacle' to peace efforts, cites ban on territorial changes	Russia sees Ukraine&apos;s Constitution as an &quot;obstacle&quot; to peace efforts as it does not permit territorial changes, Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu said on March 19, according to state-owned TASS news agency. &quot;On Ukraine&apos;s part, the main obstacle is the Constitution. Their Constitution prohibits any negotiations regarding changes in territory,&quot; Shoigu told journalists. The comments underscore Moscow&apos;s efforts to legitimize its occupation of one-fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory as part of a potential peace deal pushed forward by U.S. President Donald Trump. Russia occupied and illegally annexed Crimea at the start of its aggression against Ukraine in 2014. After the outbreak of the full-scale invasion in 2022, Moscow also illegally declared annexation of partially occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts. President Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected recognizing Russian occupation of Ukrainian territories in any peace talks, calling it a &quot;red line&quot; that Kyiv will not cross. Ukraine&apos;s Constitution states that the &quot;territory of Ukraine within its present border is indivisible and inviolable.&quot; The Semafor outlet reported earlier this week that the Trump administration is considering recognizing Crimea as part of a peace deal. Washington has not confirmed this claim. Shoigu also named the &quot;legitimacy of power&quot; as another supposed obstacle to peace talks, alluding to the Kremlin&apos;s long-standing narrative about Zelensky&apos;s illegitimacy, which Trump has also echoed. Russia claims that Zelensky is no longer a legitimate head of state since Ukraine suspended elections that were to be held in 2024. The Ukrainian Constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which was declared at the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Zelensky said that the next vote would be held after a peace deal is concluded and martial law is lifted.	https://kyivindependent.com/shoigu-claims-ukraines-constitution-obstacle-to-peace-efforts/	2025-03-20T02:51:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/shoigu.jpg
EU provides $1 billion in aid to Ukraine backed by frozen Russian assets	The European Commission has disbursed an additional 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA) to Ukraine, to be repaid with proceeds from frozen Russian assets, the commission announced on March 20. &quot;With today&apos;s payment of 1 billion euros, we are reiterating our steadfast commitment to Ukraine. We are helping the country&apos;s economy stay on course and rebuild critical infrastructure damaged by Russian aggression,&quot; Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. Western nations froze around $300 billion in Russian assets after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with roughly two-thirds held in Europe. The MFA amounts to 18.1 billion euros ($19.6 billion) in total, representing the EU&apos;s contribution to a G7-led initiative that collectively aims to provide Ukraine with approximately 45 billion euros ($48.8 billion) in financial support. With this latest payment, the European Commission has disbursed 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) to Ukraine under the MFA since the start of 2024. In October 2024, the Group of Seven agreed to provide Ukraine with nearly $50 billion in loans backed by the revenue generated from frozen Russian assets.	https://kyivindependent.com/european-commission-provides-1-billion-in-aid-to-ukraine-backed-by-frozen-russian-assets/	2025-03-20T02:40:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/DSC07899------.jpg
5 killed, 26 injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least five people and injured 26 others over the past day, regional officials reported on March 20. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reportedly intercepted 75 of the 171 Russian drones launched overnight, including Shahed-type attack drones. Another 63 drones disappeared from radars before reaching their targets, likely acting as decoys to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defenses. Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare systems, aviation, and mobile fire groups repelled the attack. In Kirovohrad Oblast, a Russian drone strike on Kropyvnytskyi injured 10 people, including four children, in what Governor Andrii Raikovych described as the most extensive Russian attack using Shahed drones against the region. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian attacks killed one resident in Kostiantynivka and wounded five others, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Kharkiv Oblast, four people were injured across the region, and one person was killed in Kupiansk when a Russian KAB-guided aerial bomb struck a house, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. In Kherson Oblast, two people were killed, and four others were wounded as Russian forces targeted critical and social infrastructure facilities and residential areas, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. In Sumy Oblast, Russian forces dropped six KAB-guided aerial bombs, killing one person and injuring another, the local military administration reported. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, two men were wounded in a Russian strike on the regional center, Zaporizhzhia, Governor Ivan Fedorov said.	https://kyivindependent.com/5-killed-26-injured-in-russian-attacks-against-ukraine-over-past-day/	2025-03-20T02:14:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/Kropy.jpg
Extending NATO's Article 5 to Ukraine would test Russia’s peace intentions, Meloni says	Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni reiterated calls for extending NATO&apos;s Article 5 security guarantees to Ukraine, arguing that doing so would demonstrate whether Russia is serious about peace, she said in a speech to the Italian Chamber of Deputies on March 19. Article 5, the cornerstone of NATO&apos;s collective defense, says that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all. It has only been invoked once, after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York. &quot;Extending NATO&apos;s Article 5 to Ukraine seems to be the simplest and most effective proposal of all, also because it would help call a possible bluff,&quot; Meloni said. &quot;If Russia does not plan to invade its neighbors again, it is not clear why it should not accept security guarantees that are only defensive.&quot; Meloni first suggested on March 6 that NATO could extend Article 5 protection to Ukraine without granting Kyiv full membership in the alliance. The Italian prime minister has positioned herself as a potential bridge between European leaders and the Trump administration, which has called Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations unrealistic. Washington has instead backed the idea of European-led peacekeeping forces monitoring a potential ceasefire but has not offered concrete security guarantees to Ukraine. Despite growing European support for bolstering Ukraine&apos;s security, Italy has ruled out sending peacekeepers to eastern Ukraine to enforce a potential ceasefire. &quot;We should not slavishly follow the proposals put forward by others simply because we have to decide what our position is. Our role is to participate with our own proposals,&quot; Meloni said, adding that her Article 5 proposal should be &quot;on the negotiating table.&quot; Over 30 countries have expressed willingness to contribute to a peacekeeping force in Ukraine, with the U.K. and France leading the initiative, according to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer&apos;s office. Canada and Australia have also signaled openness to participating. NATO allies reaffirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible&quot; path toward membership in July 2024 but have not extended a formal invitation despite repeated calls from Kyiv. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 24 that Russian President Vladimir Putin would allow European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a deal, though Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov publicly rejected the idea.	https://kyivindependent.com/extending-natos-article-5-to-ukraine-would-test-russias-peace-intentions-meloni-says/	2025-03-20T02:09:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2158921351.jpg
Berlin Wall is not an option' — Zelensky warns against dividing Ukrainian cities by contact line	Ukrainian towns and cities divided by a demarcation line in the event of a ceasefire would be left empty and desolate, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a briefing with journalists on March 20. Zelensky said he discussed the issue with U.S. President Donald Trump on March 19 and warned him against leaving Ukrainian settlements split by the contact line. &quot;There are regions, there are cities and towns that are cut off by a contact line, and if in some places you leave this line in place, you will simply leave these cities or towns without life; no one will return to half of the city,&quot; Zelensky said, comparing such cities to divided Berlin during the Cold War. &quot;I told President Trump honestly: Do we want Berlin?... I think we both understood that this was not an option. The Berlin Wall is not an option.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s comments come amid Trump&apos;s push to broker a ceasefire and, subsequently, a broader peace deal in Ukraine. The Ukrainian president acknowledged that the &quot;issue of territories will be the most difficult.&quot; Russia continues to occupy roughly 20% of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea and large parts of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts. Reports of systematic repression, torture, and forced deportations have been emerging from occupied territories. Zelensky has repeatedly stressed that Ukraine would never recognize the occupied territories as Russian soil. At the same time, the Ukrainian leadership has acknowledged that some territories, such as Crimea, are unlikely to be liberated by military means in the near future. The Semafor outlet reported earlier this week that the Trump administration is considering recognizing Crimea as part of a peace deal. Washington has not confirmed this claim.	https://kyivindependent.com/berlin-wall-is-not-an-option-zelensky-warns-against-dividing-ukrainian-cities-by-contact-line/	2025-03-20T01:39:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/photo_2024-01-29_14-15-42.jpg
Zelensky says he and Trump discussed US help in restoring Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 19 that he had discussed with U.S. President Donald Trump the possibility of U.S. assistance in restoring the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest nuclear facility in Europe, currently under Russian occupation. &quot;Water supply, technical staff, and many more steps to ensure that in a year and a half to two and a half, the plant starts to bring money and electricity to people. This is my vision,&quot; Zelensky said during a Zoom briefing for journalists. The Zaporizhzhia plant&apos;s location, the city of Enerhodar in Zaporizhzhia Oblast on the east bank of the Dnipro River, remains under Russian occupation, and Ukraine has no access to the surrounding territory. During the phone call, Trump suggested to Zelensky that the U.S. could be &quot;very helpful in running the plants with its electricity and utility expertise&quot; and that &quot;American ownership of those plants would be the best protection,&quot; the White House said, without naming specific facilities. During the March 19 briefing, Zelensky noted that Trump, during their phone call, had asked whether the U.S. could play a role in rebuilding the facility. &quot;Yes, if we can modernize it, invest money. This can be discussed, but we talked about only one station,&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky confirmed on March 14 that the fate of the Zaporizhzhia plant and adjacent Russian-occupied territories had been discussed with the U.S. during bilateral talks in Saudi Arabia a week earlier. While the station remains under Russian control, it does not generate electricity. The facility has been repeatedly disconnected from Ukraine&apos;s power grid due to Russian attacks on the country&apos;s energy infrastructure. Moscow has ignored calls to relinquish control of the facility. Experts told the Kyiv Independent that regaining control over the plant is challenging for Ukraine and that maintaining a military presence there without liberating the surrounding areas remains unlikely. Ukraine and its allies have consistently urged Russia to withdraw its troops from the plant, warning of nuclear safety risks posed by its militarization. Russian forces continue to occupy about 20% of Ukraine, with reports of systematic repression, torture, and forced deportations emerging from occupied territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-trump-discuss-us-help-in-restoring-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant/	2025-03-20T00:48:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1249892066.jpg

The number includes 1,400 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,377 tanks, 21,561 armored fighting vehicles, 41,094 vehicles and fuel tanks, 24,747 artillery systems, 1,322 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,110 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 29,895 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-899-470-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-03-19T23:29:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2096001857.jpg
Russian airfield in Saratov Oblast reportedly on fire after heaviest drone attack on region	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. The Russian cities of Saratov and Engels were targeted in the heaviest drone attack against Saratov Oblast throughout the entire full-scale war overnight on March 20, Governor Roman Busargin claimed, reporting a fire at a local airfield. Residents reported an air raid alert followed by a series of explosions in the region, according to Russian Telegram channels. At least four blasts could be heard at around 4 a.m. local time, according to Mash. The cities of Engels and Saratov lie near the Engels-2 military airbase, which hosts strategic bomber planes regularly used for aerial strikes on Ukraine. The independent news channel Astra reported explosions near the airbase. According to Busargin, residents living near the airfield are being evacuated. The Shot Telegram channel wrote that a fire also erupted in the area of a local oil depot in Engels. Russian officials have not commented on possible damages to oil infrastructure. Russian air defenses shot down 132 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 54 over Saratov Oblast, 40 over Voronezh Oblast, 22 over Belgorod Oblast, and others over the Rostov, Kursk, and Lipetsk oblasts, as well as over occupied Crimea, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-saratov-engels-reportedly-hit-by-massive-drone-attack/	2025-03-19T23:22:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/DeWatermark_ai_1742451380481.png
Finland to lead international bomb shelter coalition for Ukraine	Finnish President Alexander Stubb and President Volodymyr Zelensky finalized a &quot;civil protection coalition&quot; on March 19, Zelensky told reporters during a press briefing. Finland will seek out more international partners to partake in the coalition and assist Ukraine in building shelters in the face of regular Russian aerial attacks. Ministers from Finland and Ukraine signed the agreement on March 19. Details of the coalition will be outlined in the coming days. No additional information was provided as to how much funding would go into establishing addition air raid shelters. The announcement comes after Zelensky arrived on a state visit to Finland on March 18 with First Lady Olena Zelenska. &quot;Our nations understand the realities of being neighbors with Russia. Finland has a long-standing tradition of effective civil protection measures, and today we discussed how to expand this expertise,&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky noted Finland&apos;s leadership in guiding the coalition is &quot;extremely important&quot; amid uncertainty in Russia&apos;s commitment to a partial ceasefire on civilian and energy infrastructure. Finland previously announced that it would provide 660 million euros ($691 million) in military aid for Ukraine on Feb. 26. &quot;Finland will continue to provide strong assistance. We stand with Ukraine and will remain by its side for as long as necessary,&quot; Stubb said. Finland alongside other Nordic and Baltic nations urged the EU earlier in the day to provide concrete steps to accelerate Ukraine&apos;s accession to the bloc.	https://kyivindependent.com/finland-to-lead-international-bomb-shelter-coalition-for-ukraine/	2025-03-19T21:52:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/romania.jpg
US, Ukrainian delegations to meet in Saudi Arabia in 'coming days,' Zelensky says	Ukrainian and U.S. officials are expected to meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days for continued peace talks, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post to social media on March 19. Following a phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 18, a partial ceasefire on energy infrastructure strikes was agreed upon. Zelensky and Trump held a subsequent call on March 19 to discuss the U.S. president&apos;s conversation with Putin the day prior, with Zelensky ultimately agreeing to stop strikes on Russian energy infrastructure. Zelensky&apos;s announcement comes as U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said on March 19 on X that talks between Russian and American delegations to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine will also take place in the coming days in Riyadh. It was not immediately clear as to when the meetings would take place or whether the Ukrainian delegation will meet face-to-face with their Russian counterparts. &quot;Ukrainian and American teams are ready to meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to continue coordinating steps toward peace. We instructed our advisors and representatives to carry out this work as quickly as possible,&quot; Zelensky said following the call. Zelensky voiced that the U.S. and Ukrainian delegations will continue to work out &quot;technical issues&quot; regarding the partial ceasefire. During a joint press conference with Finnish President Alexander Stubb in Helsinki earlier in the day, Zelensky said that Kyiv will compile a list of energy, infrastructure, and civilian sites that Russia must cease attacking and present the document to international partners. &quot;In further meetings, the teams can agree on all necessary aspects of advancing toward lasting peace and security guarantees,&quot; he said. Ukrainian and U.S. delegations last met in Saudi Arabia on March 11, where Ukraine agreed to a U.S. proposal for a complete ceasefire. Russia did not agree to a complete ceasefire. Prior to the March 11 meeting, Ukrainian and U.S. relations were at a low point following a heated argument in the White House between Zelensky and Trump on Feb. 28. U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine were paused for several days until the two sides met in Saudi Arabia on March 11. Included in the Ukrainian delegation are Andriy Yermak, Zelensky&apos;s chief of staff, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Deputy Head of the Presidential Office Pavlo Palisa.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-ukraine-delegations-to-meet-in-saudi-arabia-for-new-talks-zelensky-says/	2025-03-19T20:34:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204495046.jpg
Massive' drone attack on Kirovohrad Oblast injures 8, including a child	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched its &quot;largest attack in recent years&quot; on Kropyvnytskyi in Kirovohrad Oblast overnight on March 20, injuring eight people, including a child, regional Governor Andriy Raykovych said. Over 20 Russian drones were launched at the city overnight, striking homes and residential buildings, Raykovych told Suspilne. A total of three people required hospitalization following the attack, with one of the injured victims, who is in critical condition, sustaining surface burns to 90% of their body. No additional information was provided on the extent of the injuries for the remaining victims. Ukrzaliznytsia, Ukraine&apos;s railway authority, reported that railway infrastructure has been damaged as a result of the attack. Emergency services are currently working at the scene. Kropyvnytskyi, with a population of around 220,000, is the administrative center of Kirovohrad Oblast in central Ukraine. Russia has regularly launched drone attack on various cities across Ukraine since the beginning of their full-scale invasion. Drone attacks have continued to ramp up in recent months with Russia deploying 150 to 200 drones per attack against Ukraine. Russian forces plan to increase their capabilities to 500 drones per aerial attack against Ukraine, Vadym Skibitskyi, the deputy head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), said in an interview with RBC Ukraine published on March 3.	https://kyivindependent.com/massive-drone-attack-on-kirovohrad-oblast-injures-8-including-a-child/	2025-03-19T19:50:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-19_22-38-01.jpg
State Department did not delete investigation data into abducted Ukrainian children, spokesperson says	The U.S. did not delete data collected from investigations Ukrainian children abducted by of Russians amid the full-scale war, U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said on March 19. The Trump administration cut funding to an initiative led by Yale University that tracked Russian war crimes, including the forced deportation of Ukrainian children. The database included thousands of Ukrainian children forcibly taken to Russia and there were concerns the data may have been deleted. Bruce clarified the data was not controlled by the State Department and remains intact at a press briefing at the State Department on March 19. &quot;The data exists, it was not in the State Department&#x2019;s control. It was the people running that framework, we know who was running the data and the website we know fully that the data exists and (it has) not been deleted and (is) not missing,&quot; Bruce said. The comments come amid the Trump administration&apos;s efforts to cut various agencies and initiatives, including foreign aid. The multiple cuts to foreign funding has begun to affect international efforts to hold Russia accountable, including for war crimes committed in Ukraine Bruce said it was &quot;good news&quot; that the data was not deleted in response to journalists. &quot;What I can tell you, though, is also that the conspiracy theory or the fear or whatever it was about data being deleted is untrue. So that is false,&quot; she said. Following a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 18, U.S. President Donald Trump followed up with President Volodymyr Zelensky on March 19, the spokesperson said. &quot;President Trump also asked President Zelensky about the children who (have) gone missing from Ukraine during the war, including the ones that had been abducted. President Trump promised to work closely with both parties to help make sure those children were returned home,&quot; Bruce said.

Zelensky confirms new arrival of F-16 jets to Ukraine	A new shipment of Western F-16 fighter jets has arrived in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed to journalists on March 19. The president stated that several F-16s had arrived but did not reveal the exact number of jets delivered. &quot;Additional F-16s have arrived in Ukraine. The Russians lied that they shot down something there, they didn&apos;t shoot anything down. And the good news is that several F-16 aircraft have arrived in Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky told reporters during a briefing, RBC Ukraine reported. Earlier in the day Russian media claimed that an F-16 jets was downed in Sumy Oblast, a claim that Ukraine&apos;s Air Force denied. Zelensky did not specify from where the jets were delivered from. Ukraine has been requesting F-16s since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, with the first jets arriving in August 2024 after approval from several Western countries. Several countries have contributed F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine&apos;s defense efforts, with the Netherlands &#x2014; who announced the continued deployment of F-16s to Ukraine &#x2014; playing a significant role by committing 24 F-16s. Denmark has pledged 19 F-16s, with initial deliveries made in 2024, while Norway has promised between 6 and 22 aircraft. Belgium has also announced its intention to supply F-16s, though the exact number remains undisclosed. F-16s are used in both offensive and defensive operations. The aircraft have been used for intercepting Russian missiles and drones during aerial strikes against Ukraine. They could also be deployed to launch missiles and bombs at Russian positions along the front line.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-confirms-new-arrival-of-f-16-jets-in-ukraine/	2025-03-19T17:53:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1601919862.jpg
Russian attacks on railway infrastructure in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast injure four workers	Russia carried out two attacks on Ukraine&apos;s railway energy infrastructure in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, injuring four workers, Ukrzaliznytsia reported on March 19. Of the four injured workers, two are reported to be in serious condition. Preliminary reports indicated that a ballistic missile was used in the attack. The second strike hit the original site as recovery efforts were ongoing. The attack caused power outages in some areas, but train services remained unaffected. Russian forces have continuously targeted Ukraine&apos;s critical infrastructure, targeting various regions of the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-on-dnipropetrovsk-oblast-injure-four/	2025-03-19T15:27:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1453964318.jpg
Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Plant in focus of Ukraine peace talks. What's at stake?	The White House on March 19 proposed Ukraine pass its nuclear facilities to the U.S. as part of the ongoing ceasefire talks. &quot;The United States could be very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise. American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure,&quot; White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a press briefing on March 19. The control of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), the largest one in Europe, has been actively discussed between Kyiv and Washington over the past week. President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed on March 14 that the fate of the plant and the adjacent Russian-occupied territories were discussed with the U.S. during bilateral talks in Saudi Arabia a week prior. Zelensky said that the return of the plant without Ukrainian control over the city in which the plant is located &#x2014; Enerhodar &#x2014; isn&apos;t possible. &quot;You can&apos;t just say: here&apos;s the plant, and the city (of Enerhodar) is separate,&quot; Zelensky said. Enerhodar, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, is located on the Russian-occupied east bank of the Dnipro River, with Ukraine having no access to the adjacent territory. Experts told the Kyiv Independent that regaining control over the plant is a difficult goal for Ukraine, and a potential prolonged military presence there without driving the Russians out of the surrounding territories is an unlikely option. &quot;This is a political, military, perhaps diplomatic, but definitely not an energy question,&quot; Oleksandr Kharchenko, managing director at the Energy Industry Research Center, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;(But) I sincerely believe that the creation of a joint venture, provided that the United States brings additional finances, corporate governance rules, access to investments and capacity expansion to Ukrainian Energoatom, would definitely, in my opinion, be in Ukraine&apos;s favor,&quot; he added. Russia has, so far, ignored the calls to relinquish control of the plant. Located on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is a strategically important facility that Russia turned into a military base, Ukrainian officials have said. According to Enerhodar&apos;s exiled mayor, Dmytro Orlov, around 1,000 Russian soldiers have been deployed on the plant&apos;s territory as of late summer 2024. Russian troops use the plant as a training ground and a launchpad for drone attacks targeting Ukraine-controlled territories, the military said. The city of Nikopol in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which sits across the river, regularly suffers from Russian attacks. The chances that Russia will voluntarily leave the plant remain &quot;slim given its value,&quot; said Emil Kastehelmi, an analyst at the Finland-based Black Bird Group. &quot;A withdrawal for whatever reason would be seen as a significant loss for Russia, and removing Russian forces from the area would most likely require significant military power,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. A fire at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant on Aug. 11, 2024. (Screenshot / President Volodymyr Zelensky / Telegram)&quot;It plays an important role in the future in supplying electricity to the occupied territories, which Russia also has no intention of giving back to their rightful owner.&quot; Kyiv pins hope to return the nuclear plant through diplomatic means after military attempts to regain control failed to succeed. Military Intelligence Chief Kyrylo Budanov and Ukrainian soldiers said the first attempt to create a bridgehead for the liberation of the occupied plant was made in August 2022. The two attempts of landing followed later the same year. Kastehelmi said that a potential large-scale offensive by Ukraine to retake the plant looks &quot;risky and unrealistic&quot; at this time. &quot;In theory, there could be a diplomatic breakthrough which would then give the plant back to Ukrainian control, but currently, it&apos;s difficult to see where Ukraine could gain such political leverage,&quot; the expert said. The Zaporizhzhia plant accounted for 20% of the country&apos;s electricity supplies and almost half of nuclear power generation before the full-scale war. Now, all of its si&#x445; reactors are in a cold shutdown. The plant does not generate power and relies on two power lines connected to Ukrainian-controlled territories for off-site electricity, compared to the 10 it had before the war. Both have suffered repeated disconnections due to Russian attacks. Energoatom, Ukraine&apos;s state-owned nuclear power plant operator, said that the plant has experienced eight blackouts and one partial shutdown since the beginning of the all-out war. A day after the U.S.-Russia talks in Riyadh in late February, Alexey Likhachev, the head of Russia&apos;s state-owned nuclear energy company Rosatom, said that Russia is planning to relaunch the plant. Energoatom Head Petro Kotin said that under current circumstances, it&apos;s impossible. The plant was dependent on the Kakhovka Reservoir for water used to cool the reactors. The reservoir dried out following the Russian destruction of the Kakhovka Dam. Russia also lacks power lines and qualified personnel, and the nuclear fuel at the plant is no longer usable, Kotin said. &quot;This is our plant, it will not work without us,&quot; Zelensky said on March 18. &quot;According to (Ukraine&apos;s) intelligence, the Russians really want it to work without us. They are trying to drag the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) into this.&quot; Inspectors from the IAEA, stationed at the Russian-occupied facility since the fall of 2022 to monitor risks and ensure the safety of operations, are meant to rotate every 80 days. In early March, the IAEA conducted its first rotation through the Russian-occupied territories, which was met with outrage and concern by Kyiv. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry blamed the situation on Russian blackmail, saying that Moscow&apos;s forces had blocked staff rotations through Ukrainian-controlled territory. Russian President Vladimir Putin meets with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director Rafael Mariano Grossi in Sochi, Russia, on March 6, 2024. (Kremlin Press Office/Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images)Greenpeace Ukraine saw this move as Russia&apos;s tactic to involve the IAEA in a potential relaunch of the plant&apos;s nuclear reactors. But IAEA Chief Rafael Grossi called the recent rotation an &quot;extraordinary exception,&quot; claiming that it was impossible to conduct it in a secure manner. Kharchenko believes that if the plant remains under Russian control in case of a ceasefire, Moscow will sooner or later be able to restart its work, albeit with difficulties. &#x201C;If they get enough time and do not face any opposition from Ukraine, they will be able to do it (relaunch the plant) in some foreseeable period. It is not easy and it won&apos;t be soon,&#x201D; he said. Fabian Hoffmann, a defense expert and doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo, said that if Ukraine could gain access to the plant and push Russian forces back enough to restart its work, it would give &quot;a significant boost&quot; to Ukrainian energy production. &quot;Essentially, that&apos;s another piece of energy infrastructure that Russia cannot target the same way that Russia throughout the war has not been targeting other Ukrainian nuclear infrastructure, simply because it&apos;s a big no,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;I think the Russians will try to maintain control over it just because it&apos;s politically useful for them. And it would be economically enormously useful for Ukraine to get it back. And that&apos;s reason enough for the Russians to try to hold it.&quot; Meanwhile, as the talks about the plant&apos;s future gain traction in Kyiv and Washington, the fate of the city remains unclear. Russia brought Rosatom employees to Enerhodar to take control of the plant, seeking to force locals to collaborate. Truth Hounds, a Ukrainian non-profit organization that documents and investigates war crimes, reported, citing witnesses, that with the knowledge of Rosatom, Russian troops have been abducting and torturing Ukrainian employees. Before the full-scale war, 11,000 people worked at the plant, of whom 5,000 remain under occupation to this day. Oleksandr Pavlichenko, executive director of the Ukrainian Helsinki Human Rights Union, said around 2,000 refused to sign a contract with Rosatom. The plant&apos;s employees are not allowed to leave the city and went through torture chambers set up by Russia in the city, he told the Kyiv Independent. Pavlichenko calls the resistance that Russian troops faced during attempts to occupy the city may be the reason for &quot;a very systematic terror against the entire population of Enerhodar.&quot; According to Pavlichenko, 21 employees of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are incarcerated as of March 18. In October 2022, the Kyiv Independent published a detailed report about the systematic torture in Enerhodar. Residents of the Russian-occupied city and those who were able to escape have detailed the abductions and torture practices that local citizens had faced. &quot;Those who show any disagreement are persecuted,&quot; Pavlichenko said. &quot;Now there is total control there. It&apos;s a so-called concentration camp.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-occupied-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-in-focus-of-ukraine-peace-talks-whats-at-stake/	2025-03-19T14:45:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1240384920-3.jpg
EU plans to supply at least 2 million shells annually to Ukraine	The European Union plans to supply Ukraine with at least 2 million shells annually, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas announced on March 19. Kallas revealed this during a press conference in Brussels, where the European Commission presented the White Paper on the future of EU defense. The White Paper outlines a new strategy for strengthening European defense and increasing military support for Ukraine. A dedicated section on Ukraine highlights plans to provide not only shells but also air defense systems, drones, and training and equipment for Ukrainian brigades. Kallas said that the new SAFE instrument, a 150 billion euro ($163 billion) credit tool proposed by the European Commission, will support the achievement of this objective. &#x201C;This is a pivotal moment for European security. It is a pivotal moment for action,&#x201D; Kallas stated. In 2024, the EU reached its goal of delivering one million shells to Ukraine, fulfilling the pledge it initially promised to deliver by the spring of 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-plans-to-supply-at-least-2-million-shells-annually-to-ukraine/	2025-03-19T14:23:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1775102025.jpeg
Ukraine war latest: Trump, Zelensky hold phone call to discuss ceasefire; Ukraine brings back 175 soldiers from Russian captivity	Key developments on March 19: President Volodymyr Zelensky said he agreed to stop strikes on Russian energy infrastructure during a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump on March 19. &quot;One of the first steps toward fully ending the war could be ending strikes on energy and other civilian infrastructure. I supported this step, and Ukraine confirmed that we are ready to implement it,&quot; Zelensky said on X following the hour-long call with Trump. The call between Trump and Zelensky came a day after the U.S. president spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the phone. Following the call, Putin announced he had agreed to a 30-day truce on strikes on energy infrastructure. The same night &#x2014; overnight on March 19 &#x2014;Russia carried out a large-scale drone attack that targeted energy infrastructure and other facilities. Russia has been bombing Ukraine&apos;s civilian energy infrastructure since 2022 and has been steadily expanding its air campaigns in recent months, with bombardments by swarms of Shahed drones now a nightly occurrence. Ukraine has also launched regular drone attacks on Russia in response. On the night of March 10, over 330 Ukrainian drones targeted Moscow. Other strikes have targeted Russia&apos;s fossil fuel infrastructure. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky held a phone call on March 19, during which Trump suggested American ownership of Ukraine&apos;s power plants could help ensure their security. Trump and Zelensky discussed Ukraine&apos;s electrical supply and nuclear power plants during the call, according to a readout of the conversation presented by White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt during a press briefing. Trump said the U.S. could be &quot;very helpful in running the plants with its electricity and utility expertise,&quot; adding that &quot;American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure.&quot; It is unclear from the readout what energy infrastructure or nuclear power plants the U.S. could help run or acquire. Trump on March 13 said that as part of peace deal talks, he had discussed Russian-occupied territory with Ukraine, including the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant &#x2014; Europe&apos;s largest nuclear site &#x2014; that has been under Russian control since the early days of the invasion. &quot;There&apos;s a power plant involved, a very big power plant involved. Who is going to get the power plant, and who is going to get this and that, and so you know it&apos;s not an easy process. But phase one is the ceasefire,&quot; Trump said on March 13. The Trump-Zelensky phone call follows an hour-and-a-half-long conversation between the U.S. president and Russian President Vladimir Putin a day prior on March 18. Following the call, Putin said he had agreed to a limited 30-day pause on energy attacks. Overnight on March 19, Russia launched an aerial attack on Ukraine, targeting energy infrastructure in some parts of the country. Russia has been targeting Ukraine&apos;s civilian energy infrastructure since 2022. In recent months, Moscow has intensified aerial campaigns with bombardments by swarms of Shahed drones a nightly occurrence. Ukraine has also launched regular attacks on Russia&apos;s fossil fuel production &#x2014; a major revenue source for the Russian state. Zelensky said after the call with Trump that he had also agreed to stop strikes on Russia&apos;s energy infrastructure. Material losses from Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure have amounted to &quot;billions of dollars,&quot; according to Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko. Halushchenko said on Feb. 24 that Russia has launched more than 30 mass strikes on Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure over the three years of its full-scale invasion. Over the past three years, Russian troops have occupied territories hosting energy facilities producing 18 gigawatts (GW) of generation. Ukraine has brought home 175 Ukrainian soldiers in a one-for-one prisoner exchange with Russia that was mediated by the United Arab Emirates, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on March 19. The news of the swap came after a phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin a day earlier. Another 22 Ukrainian service members returned through negotiations outside of the one-for-one exchange. As part of the swap, Russia also brought back 175 Russian soldiers. The recent exchange included Ukrainian military personnel who served in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, Sumy, and Kursk oblasts, as well as thosewho defended the city of Mariupol and its Azovstal steel plant, according to Zelensky. Among the prisoners of war who have returned are those that were seriously wounded and prosecuted by Russia for crimes they did not commit. All of them will be provided with the necessary medical and psychological assistance, Zelensky said. &quot;This is one of the largest exchanges. Our soldiers, sergeants and officers are returning. The soldiers who fought for our freedom in the Armed Forces, Navy, National Guard, Territorial Defense Forces and Border Guard,&quot; Zelensky wrote on Telegram. The Ukrainian president also expressed gratitude to the United Arab Emirates for making the exchange possible. &quot;Ukraine remembers each and every one of our heroes, and we will definitely bring all our people home,&quot; Zelensky said. Following a call with U.S. President Donald Trump on March 18, the Kremlin announced that it would conduct a one-for-one prisoner exchange with Ukraine. Moscow claimed that it would release 23 severely wounded Ukrainian soldiers, but only transferred 22. Ukraine, on Feb. 5, brought back 150 Ukrainian service members from Russian captivity. In 2024, 1,358 Ukrainians were released, and since the beginning of the all-out war, 3,956 Ukrainians have returned from Russian captivity, Zelensky said in his New Year&apos;s address. Ukrainian drones attacked the Kavkazskaya oil pumping station in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai overnight on March 19, damaging infrastructure and causing a fire, pro-Kremlin news outlet Shot and regional authorities claimed. The attack reportedly damaged a pipeline connecting storage tanks, sparking a fire that covered an area of about 20 square meters. The regional operational headquarters confirmed that 30 on-duty personnel were evacuated and that the facility suspended operations. No casualties were reported. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the reported attacks. The Kavkazskaya oil transshipment point is crucial in Russia&apos;s energy exports, connecting a railroad oil terminal and the Kropotkinskaya oil pumping station. It is part of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium system, which pumps up to 6 million metric tons of oil annually. The strike follows Ukraine&apos;s Feb. 17 drone attack on the Kropotkinskaya oil pumping station, also in Krasnodar Krai, where seven drones reportedly hit key infrastructure. Kyiv has intensified its campaign against Russia&apos;s energy and military infrastructure to disrupt Moscow&apos;s war effort. On March 17, Ukrainian drones struck a fuel and energy facility in Russia&apos;s Astrakhan Oblast, igniting a fire, regional Governor Igor Babushkin claimed. The attack comes amid talks about a possible halt on mutual strikes against energy targets. The same night, Russia launched 145 drones and six missiles against Ukraine, inflicting civilian casualties and damaging infrastructure. Ukraine has consistently targeted Russian refineries, oil depots, and defense industry sites, aiming to limit Russia&apos;s ability to sustain its full-scale invasion. The outgoing German government agreed to release an additional 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) in military assistance for Ukraine, a German Finance Ministry spokesperson confirmed for the Kyiv Independent on March 19. Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz has long blocked the package unless it is financed by additional borrowing. Friedrich Merz, who is set to become the next chancellor after his conservative CDU/CSU alliance won the elections in February, voiced confidence that the additional assistance would be approved as he unveiled massive efforts to boost defense spending by reforming Germany&apos;s debt brake. Merz, who is seeking to build a new government coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD), scored a major win earlier this week after the outgoing parliament approved a spending surge that could unleash up to 500 billion euros ($545 billion) for Germany&apos;s defense and infrastructure. According to Reuters, the parliamentary budget committee should approve the funds for Ukraine on March 21, as long as the Bundesrat, a legislative body representing Germany&apos;s federal states, approves Merz&apos;s reforms. Germany is Ukraine&apos;s largest military donor in Europe, and its role is likely only to grow as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to reduce American involvement on the continent and restore ties with Russia. The 3-billion-euro package is in addition to the 4 billion euros ($4.36 billion) already allocated for Kyiv in 2025. Reuters reported earlier on March 19 that German Finance Minister Joerg Kukies has informed parliament&apos;s budget committee that the requirements for additional funds for Ukraine have been met. This was later confirmed by the ministry&apos;s spokesperson to the Kyiv Independent. The sum of 3 billion euros includes 2.547 billion euros ($2.8 billion) from the German budget, with the rest being reimbursed by the European Peace Facility. Kukies also plans to authorize some 8.252 billion euros ($8.9 billion) in military aid to Ukraine between 2026 and 2029.

US has 'moved beyond minerals deal' to focus on lasting ceasefire in Ukraine, White House says	Washington has moved on from a minerals deal with Kyiv to focus on achieving a lasting ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a press briefing on March 19. Leavitt said that did not mean a deal for the U.S. to develop Ukraine&apos;s mineral resources was off the table, but that the two sides had &quot;moved beyond just the economic minerals deal framework, and (are) looking at a lasting ceasefire&quot; in Ukraine. After weeks of tense negotiations, the deal was set to be signed on Feb. 28, but that plan was derailed after a public clash between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, leaving the agreement&apos;s fate uncertain. After the U.S. froze military assistance for Kyiv, Zelensky issued a statement in which he called the spat &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his readiness to sign the minerals deal and work toward peace. Reuters reported that the deal was expected to be signed on March 4, but this claim was disputed by U.S. officials, and no agreement was signed. The long-debated agreement would establish a fund to which Ukraine would contribute 50% of proceeds from the future monetization of state-owned mineral resources, including oil, gas, and logistics infrastructure. The U.S. reportedly put forth three proposals of the mineral deal, but the Ukrainian side turned down the first two because they did not include security agreements, even as Washington ramped up the pressure. The third version was also void of concrete security commitments but included a line reading that the fund &quot;will be reinvested at least annually in Ukraine to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine.&quot; The Trump administration has been reluctant to commit to Ukraine&apos;s security, arguing that the economic agreement is a security guarantee of itself and that Europe should take responsibility for Kyiv&apos;s defense.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-has-moved-beyond-just-economic-minerals-deal-white-house-says/	2025-03-19T12:58:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/gettyimages-2205572300-612x612.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — McDonald's and DOGE in Ukraine	The following is the March 18, 2025 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. I&#x2019;ve always wanted an excuse to talk to this newsletter audience about McDonald&#x2019;s in Ukraine and now I have it. This past week, McDonald&#x2019;s announced it would be gradually reintroducing its breakfast menu in some cities after pausing the options at the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion more than three years ago. At every McDonald&#x2019;s press event I have been to over the last few years, the question of when breakfast would be back was always asked. After years of customer requests, viral social media trends asking for a comeback, and the &#x201C;operational hurdles&#x201D; McDonald&#x2019;s was always citing as the reason there was no breakfast, it&#x2019;s now being served in seven western Ukrainian cities. Kyiv will still have to wait a few more weeks. But while the return of McDonald&#x2019;s McMuffins and hash browns is exciting on its own, I wanted to take this opportunity to tell you about the company itself. This may come to a surprise to our foreign audience, but let me just put it plainly: McDonald&#x2019;s in Ukraine is good, like really good. (And no, this is not a sponsored ad &#x2014; but if you&#x2019;re reading McDonald&#x2019;s corporate, we wouldn&#x2019;t be opposed to a sponsored edition of the newsletter. Kidding, sort of.) As an American who grew up eating McDonald&#x2019;s (despite my mother&#x2019;s objections), and making fun of it, I feel I can be the judge of it. But just in case you don&#x2019;t take my word for it. When an American friend visited Kyiv last year and I told him he had to try Ukrainian McDonald&#x2019;s, he rolled his eyes. But as we were eating, he looked up at me and said, &#x201C;But why is it so good?&#x201D; Another American acquaintance recently showed up to a party in Kyiv with McDonald&#x2019;s in her hands, saying &#x201C;I would never eat McDonald&#x2019;s in the U.S., but when I&#x2019;m here, I just have to have it &#x2014; it&#x2019;s so good.&#x201D; Okay, so why is it &#x201C;so good&#x201D;? One reason is likely the company&#x2019;s structure. Unlike in the U.S. or U.K. where McDonald&#x2019;s operates under a decentralized franchise model, everything in Ukraine, along with some other countries, is highly controlled by HQ. The top-down approach keeps quality control in check. Everything from the freshness and taste of the food to cleanliness and the service (which is also really good in Ukraine) is tightly monitored. Many of its products are locally sourced from Ukrainian producers, like the buns and meat &#x2014; although surprisingly, not the potatoes, which are imported. The result? The burgers actually look, and taste, like burgers, the fries are never soggy, and the apple pies are always crispy (except of course if you get them delivered, in which case they can get a little bit soggy, truth be told.) Actually, the model was the same and the food just as good in Russia (I can confirm) and Belarus (hearsay) before McDonald&#x2019;s in 2022 sold off its assets in the two countries to local companies that rebranded the restaurants as &#x201C;Vkusno i Tochka!&#x201D; which translates from Russian to &#x201C;Tasty, period!&#x201D; If you think the name is silly, everyone here thinks so too, and it never gets brought up without a smirk, as if to say, &#x201C;Enjoy your knock-off McDonald&#x2019;s! We know it&#x2019;s not as good as the real thing.&#x201D; The &#x201C;real thing&#x201D; being the better Eastern European version, of course. It seems to me that the attention to high quality and good service have become a source of pride for the company, and therefore something it&#x2019;s really keen to preserve, perpetuating the well-oiled machine that is McDonald&#x2019;s Ukraine. At one press tour of its kitchen, a journalist asked why McDonald&#x2019;s didn&#x2019;t serve beer in Ukraine when KFC did. &#x201C;Why, this is a family restaurant!&#x201D; the company representative said. When McDonald&#x2019;s opened up in 1997 next to the Lukianivska metro station in Kyiv (which was actually hit in a Russian attack on the city not that long ago), it was, like the infamous opening in Moscow, a symbol of the post-Soviet countries opening up to the world. Similarly, when McDonald&#x2019;s started reopening restaurants in September 2022 after shutting down completely after the start of the full-scale invasion, people were ecstatic. Not just because they missed the tasty food, but because it signaled confidence in Ukraine and its future, despite Russia&#x2019;s onslaught. The company has opened 20 new restaurants since 2022, bringing the total number of operating restaurants to 109 in 36 cities. It also prides itself on being a &#x201C;white business&#x201D; in Ukraine, meaning that it employs all of its 10,000 or so workers officially and pays all of its taxes properly and transparently (something, unfortunately, not all businesses in Ukraine can boast). It is the largest taxpayer in the country&#x2019;s food and beverage industry, paying $65.3 million in taxes last year. Credit where credit is due. Ukrainian McDonald&#x2019;s is crushing it &#x2014; doing it better than its originators, and all while missiles and drones are flying overhead. One prominent businessman seems to have been inspired by the axe SpaceX and X owner Elon Musk is taking to the U.S. government as head of the new agency DOGE, or Department of Government Efficiency. In a post on Facebook, co-owner of Nova Poshta &#x2014; Ukraine&#x2019;s leading private postal service that has expanded rapidly across Europe and the world over the last few years &#x2014; said that as the company grows, its &#x201C;management and administrative apparati&#x201D; aren&#x2019;t able to keep up with its company of 30,000 or so employees. Volodymyr Popereshniuk&#x2019;s solution? Creating an &#x201C;efficiency department similar to DOGE&#x201D; in which he plans to &#x201C;divide employees into two categories, those who maintain the viability of the company and those who develop and improve it &#x2014; and to give an advantage and resources to the latter.&#x201D; While Popereshniuk admits he isn&#x2019;t sure DOGE is the perfect solution for business as it needs its employees to function, he supports the idea for the government. &#x201C;A commercial company is not a government, where you can fire every official and it will only get better,&#x201D; he writes, adding an emoji of a smiley face.

As the U.S. temporarily cut off military aid to Ukraine and halted intelligence sharing, rumors started to swirl that Musk would shut off his company SpaceX&#x2019;s Starlink satellite connection in Ukraine. It hasn&#x2019;t yet come to pass, but in the wake of the news, it became clear that Ukraine was preparing for that scenario if it did happen, and that some European satellite firms were hoping to fill the gap. But it isn&#x2019;t that easy. Today, Starlink satellite internet service dominates both worldwide and at Ukraine&#x2019;s front lines, the Kyiv Independent reporter Kollen Post writes in his latest. Moreover, Chinese rather than European competitors are building equivalent satellite constellations &#x2014; if Ukraine is left waiting on an ally to provide an alternative to Starlink, Russia will likely get one from China first.

Negotiations will reportedly focus on establishing the legal and financial framework to seize Russian assets despite opposition from some EU member states, particularly Belgium and Germany. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and EU diplomacy chief Kaja Kallas are expected to discuss the issue during their meeting on March 18, according to Bloomberg. Lviv&#x2019;s Danylo Halytskyi International Airport may resume aviation operations as early as April or May, according to an optimistic scenario under government consideration, its general director told Vysokyi Zamok media outlet on March 15. Other potential dates for reopening Ukraine&#x2019;s airspace include the summer months. Despite many airlines and airports expressing their readiness for a return to air travel in Ukraine, the reality is we have no idea when it will actually be safe enough for that to happen. Ukraine will receive 3.5 billion euros ($3.8 billion) after the Council of the EU approved the third installment of non-refundable grants and loans under the Ukraine Facility program, the Council announced on March 17. With this disbursement, Ukraine will have received nearly 20 billion euros ($21.7 billion) under the Ukraine Facility since the program was launched in early 2024. The Ukraine Plan outlines Kyiv&apos;s strategy for recovery, reconstruction, and modernization and a reform timetable as part of Ukraine&apos;s EU accession process over the next four years. Canada contributed another 50 million Canadian dollars ($34.8 million) to the Ukraine Energy Support Fund, Ukraine&apos;s Energy Ministry said on March 14. Canada&apos;s total contribution to the Ukraine Energy Support Fund is now over $41 million. Canada also declared a future contribution of 10 million Canadian dollars ($7 million) to the fund.

Trump agrees to help Ukraine find available Patriot air defense systems in Europe, White House says	U.S. President Donald Trump has agreed to assist Ukraine in finding additional U.S.-made Patriot air defenses available in Europe, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, citing a readout of a call between the two leaders on March 19. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky held an hour-long phone call, during which they discussed a ceasefire and bringing an end to Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, as well as protecting Ukrainian energy infrastructure. Zelensky asked Trump for additional air defense systems to protect Ukrainian civilians, in particular, Patriot missile systems, and the U.S. president agreed to find what was available, particularly in Europe, according to the readout. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Kyiv has called on its partners to provide additional air defense assets to protect its cities and infrastructure, especially its energy system, from Russian missile and drone strikes. The highly advanced Patriot systems have played a crucial role in protecting the Ukrainian sky. They are capable of downing even the most advanced ballistic missiles, such as Kinzhals. Throughout the full-scale war, there were several reports of damage to Patriot systems during Russia&apos;s aerial attacks. Ukraine also uses mock systems to protect the missile systems. Following Zelensky&apos;s clash with Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, Washington suspended all military and intelligence aid to Ukraine. After March talks between the Ukrainian and American delegations in Saudi Arabia, Washington&apos;s lifted the suspensions.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-agrees-to-help-find-patriot-air-defenses-for-ukraine-available-in-europe-white-house-says/	2025-03-19T12:16:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1229063956.jpeg
US ownership of Ukraine's power plants would be 'best protection' of energy infrastructure, White House says	President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky held a phone call on March 19, during which Trump suggested American ownership of Ukraine&apos;s power plants could help ensure their security. Trump and Zelensky discussed Ukraine&apos;s electrical supply and nuclear power plants during the call, according to a readout of the conversation presented by White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt during a press briefing. Trump said the U.S. could be &quot;very helpful in running the plants with its electricity and utility expertise,&quot; adding that &quot;American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure.&quot; It is unclear from the readout what energy infrastructure or nuclear power plants the U.S. could help run or acquire. Trump on March 13 said that as part of peace deal talks, he had discussed Russian-occupied territory with Ukraine, including the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant &#x2014; Europe&apos;s largest nuclear site &#x2014; that has been under Russian control since the early days of the invasion. &quot;There&apos;s a power plant involved, a very big power plant involved. Who is going to get the power plant, and who is going to get this and that, and so you know it&apos;s not an easy process. But phase one is the ceasefire,&quot; Trump said on March 13. The Trump-Zelensky phone call follows an hour-and-a-half-long conversation between the U.S. president and Russian President Vladimir Putin a day prior on March 18. Following the call, Putin said he had agreed to a limited 30-day pause on energy attacks. Overnight on March 19, Russia launched an aerial attack on Ukraine, targeting energy infrastructure in some parts of the country. &#xA0; Russia has been targeting Ukraine&apos;s civilian energy infrastructure since 2022. In recent months, Moscow has intensified aerial campaigns with bombardments by swarms of Shahed drones a nightly occurrence. Ukraine has also launched regular attacks on Russia&apos;s fossil fuel production &#x2014; a major revenue source for the Russian state. Zelensky said after the call with Trump that he had also agreed to stop strikes on Russia&apos;s energy infrastructure. Material losses from Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure have amounted to &quot;billions of dollars,&quot; according to Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko. Halushchenko said on Feb. 24 that Russia has launched more than 30 mass strikes on Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure over the three years of its full-scale invasion. Over the past three years, Russian troops have occupied territories hosting energy facilities producing 18 gigawatts (GW) of generation.	https://kyivindependent.com/u-s-ownership-of-ukraines-nuclear-electric-power-plants-to-be-best-protection-white-house-says/	2025-03-19T12:04:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196133049.jpg

Putin is stalling' — Trump 'ceasefire' call met with skepticism in Kyiv	U.S. President Donald Trump said it was a &quot;great call.&quot; A Kremlin aide declared the world had &quot;become a much safer place.&quot; But in Kyiv, the reaction to the call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 18 has been noticeably more muted. &#x201C;Judging by the news, there is nothing to comment on,&#x201D; Mykyta Poturayev, a lawmaker from the Servant of the People party, told the Kyiv Independent when asked what he thought of the announcements made after the call. The call was ostensibly to get Russia to agree to a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire, which Kyiv said it had agreed to, provided that Moscow did as well. On March 13, Putin said Russia was ready to agree but then followed up with a list of demands that Kyiv and Washington must accommodate in order for Moscow to proceed with peace talks. Putin once again failed to agree to the full ceasefire during the call with Trump, but the Kremlin did announce he had agreed to a limited 30-day halt on energy infrastructure strikes. Despite this, Ukraine was hit by widespread drone attacks overnight. It was also announced that there would be another prisoner swap, though these have occurred throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. While the White House has been keen to project the call as a success, Ukrainian lawmakers the Kyiv Independent spoke to saw no real progress. &quot;It looks like they just agreed to negotiate,&quot; Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, a lawmaker from the Holos party and chairman of the parliamentary committee on freedom of speech, said. &quot;Putin is trying to pass off what he needs as Trump&apos;s achievements &#x2014; stopping attacks on energy infrastructure or exchanging hostages &#x2014; and is stalling.&quot; Following the call, the Kremlin also reiterated its demand for a complete halt to foreign military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, calling it a &quot;key condition for avoiding an escalation of the war.&quot; Yelyzaveta Yasko, a lawmaker from the Servant of the People party, told the Kyiv Independent that she didn&apos;t think anything of substance was announced except the prisoner exchange. &quot;I remain suspicious and skeptical about the signals, about the wording,&quot; she said in reference to the Kremlin&apos;s statements, adding she has &quot;no hope&quot; that Russia will abide by the 30-day truce on energy infrastructure attacks. Both Yurchyshyn and Yasko believe that Trump is heading for some form of conflict with Putin as it becomes ever clearer the Kremlin has no real desire to stop the war in Ukraine.

(Contributor / Getty Images)&quot;Putin is only just starting his communications with Trump, and he&apos;s trying to get as much as he can from all these talks and conversations,&quot; Yasko said. &quot;I think the harsh reality of their relationship hasn&apos;t started yet.&quot; Yurchyshyn said Trump at this stage will &quot;pass off anything as a success,&quot; adding: &quot;Putin will definitely try to manipulate Trump&apos;s desire to achieve something quickly.&quot; Despite the muted response in Kyiv, the White House remained upbeat the following day. Trump&apos;s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, told Bloomberg TV he was confident a full ceasefire could be reached &quot;in a couple of weeks.&quot; &quot;So, lots of good things. Now, it&apos;s for the technical teams to dot the I&apos;s and cross the T&apos;s. And everybody is committed to that process,&quot; Witkoff said. According to Witkoff, the next round of U.S.-Russia talks is set to take place in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 23, and will be led by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. He did not confirm who would make up the Russian delegation this time but said the discussions would focus on key ceasefire details. Witkoff emphasized that achieving a full ceasefire depends on the 2,000-kilometer front line where Ukrainian and Russian forces are engaged in combat, noting that conditions vary significantly along different sections.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-is-stalling-trump-ceasefire-call-met-with-skepticism-in-kyiv/	2025-03-19T10:58:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204976882.jpg
Zelensky agrees to halt strikes on Russian energy infrastructure during call with Trump, Bloomberg reports	Editor&#x2019;s note: This story is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to stop strikes on Russian energy infrastructure during a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, Bloomberg reported on March 19, citing an unnamed source familiar with the situation. The call between Trump and Zelensky came a day after the U.S. president spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the phone. Following the call, Putin announced he had agreed to a 30-day truce on strikes on energy infrastructure. The same night &#x2014;&#xA0;overnight on March 19 &#x2014;Russia carried out a large-scale drone attack that targeted energy infrastructure and other facilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-agrees-to-halt-strikes-on-russian-energy-infrastructure-during-call-with-trump-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-19T10:16:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204723303.jpg

Leading Ukrainian mobile operator Kyivstar acquires ride-hailing service Uklon for $155 million	Ukraine&#x2019;s largest telecom operator, Kyivstar, has signed an agreement to acquire Uklon, a leading ride-hailing and delivery platform in the country, for $155.2 million, Kyistar&#x2019;s parent company, Veon, announced in a press release on March 19. Kyivstar &#x2014;&#xA0;which has 24 million customers in Ukraine &#x2014; has been actively expanding its portfolio since 2023 when it acquired the medical tech platform Helsi. In December, the mobile operator announced a deal with Elon Musk&apos;s SpaceX to become one of the first countries with access to Starlink&apos;s direct-to-cell service. Veon said Kyivstar would acquire 97% of Uklon&#x2019;s shares, while Uklon&#x2019;s CEO, Serhii Hryshkov, will remain in his position to continue expanding the company in Ukraine and abroad. The deal is now going through customary closing conditions and approvals, Veon said in its press release. Uklon operates in 27 cities across Ukraine, has over 100,000 drivers, and facilitated 100 million rides and 3 million deliveries in 2024. In 2023, it entered Uzbekistan, where Veon&#x2019;s subsidiary Beeline Uzbekistan is a key player. &#x201C;Uklon is the leader in its market, a favorite brand for many Ukrainians, and a technology pioneer in ride-hailing,&quot; said Oleksandr Komarov, CEO of Kyivstar. &quot;With this acquisition, we are happy to bring together two market-leading companies with strong value propositions, enhancing our ability to offer digital experiences for millions of Ukrainians 1,440 minutes a day,&quot; Komarov said. Veon Group CEO Kaan Terzioglu said the company sees potential for Uklon&#x2019;s expansion beyond Ukraine and Uzbekistan, with plans to support its growth in Kazakhstan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh through Veon&#x2019;s digital operators. &#x201C;We have always had ambitions to move forward, both into new market verticals in Ukraine and into new geographies,&quot; co-founder of Uklon Dmytro Dubrovsky said in a comment included in Veon&apos;s press release. Uklon has faced difficulties entering other markets due to strong competition from established players, such as Uber and Bolt. Since 2017, Uklon launched operations in Georgia, Moldova, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan but subsequently withdrew from all except Uzbekistan. Veon on March 18 announced it had agreed to a deal with special purpose acquisition company Cohen Circle to list Kyivstar on Nasdaq under the ticker Kyiv. The transaction is awaiting shareholder approval and is expected to close in Q3 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/leading-ukrainian-mobile-operator-kyivstar-acquires-ride-hailing-service-uklon-for-155-million/	2025-03-19T10:07:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/corp-taxi-jpeg.jpg
Success of peacekeeping forces in Ukraine hinges on deterrence	We are at a critical moment for Europe, with continental security hanging in the balance. In late February, the United Kingdom announced plans to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027. U.K. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also recently suggested he is prepared to send British troops and aircraft to enforce an American-brokered peace deal with Russia, should Ukraine approve it. Starmer has also called on other European leaders to place a greater emphasis on defense. But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has criticized these plans, warning that it would mean the &#x201C;direct, official, and unveiled involvement of NATO members in the war against Russia.&#x201D; Since returning to the White House, U.S. President Donald Trump has reopened a dialogue with Russia. He has publicly stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin could dictate the terms of any emerging peace deal, given Russia&#x2019;s significant territorial gains since February 2022. As part of his broader effort to restart diplomatic ties with Moscow, Trump believes he can negotiate a deal to end the war. Whatever form this takes, Ukraine must feel that it is beneficial. The U.K. and other European nations must step up; Europe is their continent. They must be prepared to send troops to Ukraine to reassure Kyiv and deter future Russian aggression. However, the key issue is the potential for misunderstanding or neglecting the level of engagement required. The mere presence of peacekeeping troops on the ground in Ukraine, potentially near a contested border, would not be enough to deter the Kremlin. A more robust force is necessary. Ukraine and its allies can only guard against potential Russian aggression if the Kremlin fears the consequences of launching another attack. Ideally, the U.S. would serve as the ultimate &#x201C;backstop,&#x201D; as Starmer has requested from Trump. But what if America refuses? This would be a significant setback, but it should not dissuade Europeans from stepping up. They have the means, which could be bolstered with financial support; what they seem to lack is the will. Britain is the country most likely to strengthen their resolve. If European forces are deployed, a mere peacekeeping force would not suffice. Would Russia truly fear lightly armed peacekeepers? Even after three years of war and the depletion of its forces, Moscow would not take such a force seriously. This could even provoke further aggression, potentially leading to a serious crisis down the road. For this reason, nuclear deterrence must be part of the answer. It is the ultimate &#x2014; and arguably the only &#x2014; sustainable way to ensure long-term deterrence against Russian belligerence. While the U.K.&#x2019;s nuclear deterrent is smaller than Russia&#x2019;s, it still has the capacity to devastate Russia&#x2019;s major population centers. If France is willing to help lead the coalition, it would add additional nuclear capability, with both greater firepower and a sub-strategic delivery system. But nuclear deterrence alone is not enough. It must be backed by a sufficient number of forward-deployed conventional forces so that Russia has no illusion that Britain and other European countries would be unable to disengage if it invades again. Moreover, a strong focus on bolstering naval and air capabilities across Europe would enhance the continent&#x2019;s ability to defend itself on multiple fronts and strengthen the reassurance force in Ukraine. Alongside this, there is a need to improve the Ukrainian Armed Forces&apos; ability to protect their country. Investing in technology, equipment, and strategy will all shape how the forces operate. This is critical for deterring Russia. French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and President Volodymyr Zelensky meet at Lancaster House in London on March 2, 2025. (Justin Tallis / Pool / AFP via Getty Images)Narrative projection is also essential. Through clear, resolute, and strong messaging, leaders across Europe can outline the consequences of any future invasion and the restarting of the war. Alongside allies, including French President Emmanuel Macron, Starmer must maintain an unyielding stance. The Kremlin must understand that Europe stands united against any resumption of war on the continent. Finally, Europe needs to outline the escalatory steps it would take if confronted by Russian action. While this should not be too tactical, the Kremlin must not be left with the impression that a new offensive would go unchallenged. Despite tough statements on sanctions, Europe has spent more on Russian energy since February 2022 than it has on Ukrainian aid. As such, British and European threats must remain credible, and nothing should be done to ease pressure on the Russian economy in the near future. How can we achieve this? With investment. The U.K. and European countries must allocate more resources to defense and defense-related infrastructure. European governments must invest in rearming and preparing their armed forces for potential future engagement. The situation is severe, but not insurmountable; bold leadership is required to ensure a strong defense against Russian hostility. The UK, in particular, should aim to fill any leadership void left by the U.S. Spending 2.5% of GDP on defense by 2027 is a welcome first step to ensuring broader European security. But beyond that? The goal should be 3% or even 3.5% by the end of the decade. Russia is not a superpower in the making. The U.K. and Europe possess far greater latent strength. It is time for them to enforce peace on their own continent and rise to the challenge.

US, Russian officials to meet in Saudi Arabia in 'coming days,' Waltz says	Talks between Russian and American delegations to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine will take place in the coming days in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said on March 19 on X. Waltz said he discussed Trump&apos;s efforts to stop the fighting in Ukraine with Yuri Ushakov, a close adviser to Putin. &quot;We agreed our technical teams would meet in Riyadh in the coming days to focus on implementing and expanding the partial ceasefire President Trump secured from Russia,&quot; Waltz wrote on X. Waltz&apos;s statement comes after a March 18 call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. During the call, Putin and Trump agreed that the war needs to end with &quot;a lasting peace,&quot; and the first steps towards this will be an energy and infrastructure ceasefire and technical negotiations on implementing a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea. After the Trump-Putin call, the Kremlin agreed to a 30-day pause on energy infrastructure strikes. Despite this commitment, Russia launched a large-scale assault on Ukraine&apos;s infrastructure overnight on March 19. A U.S. delegation earlier met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and top presidential aide Yuri Ushakov in Riyadh on Feb. 18 to initiate talks on ending the war in the first official meeting between the two sides since the full-scale invasion began. Ukraine was excluded from the discussions. No concrete decisions were announced following the U.S.-Russia talks, but Ukraine&apos;s exclusion from the meeting sparked alarm in Kyiv and Europe. On March 11, U.S.-Ukraine talks took place in Jeddah, in which the two sides sought a common path toward a peace deal after weeks of tense relations. After the negotiations with Washington, Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office announced that it was ready to accept a U.S. proposal for a temporary 30-day ceasefire if Russia also did the same.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-russian-officials-to-meet-in-saudi-arabia-in-coming-days-waltz-says/	2025-03-19T09:42:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203986392.jpg

Ukraine denies Russian claims of thwarted attempt to invade Belgorod Oblast — here’s what we know	Russia&#x2019;s Defense Ministry on March 18 said it had stopped a significant Ukrainian ground assault from entering Russia&#x2019;s Belgorod Oblast, a claim Kyiv swiftly dismissed as a propaganda effort. The Belgorod settlements named by Russian officials as the site of the alleged thwarted operation lie only a few dozen kilometers southeast of Sudzha, where Ukraine has almost fully retreated from the land it captured last August in the adjacent Kursk Oblast. The Kyiv Independent was not able to independently verify either party&#x2019;s claim. Here&#x2019;s what we know about the situation. Russia&#x2019;s Defense Ministry made its claims shortly after a phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump, in which Putin agreed to halt attacks on energy infrastructure but rejected an outright ceasefire with Ukraine. US President Donald Trump (Center L) and Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin (Center R) at Finland&apos;s Presidential Palace in Helsinki, Finland on July 16, 2018. (Brendan Smialowski / AFP via Getty Images)The Defense Ministry framed the alleged attacks as a Ukrainian attempt to discredit peace initiatives. It said the attacks involved up to 200 soldiers and were targeted at the settlements of Demidovka and Prilesye. &quot;A total of five attacks were carried out by the enemy during the day,&quot; the ministry said. &quot;No crossing of the state border of the Russian Federation was allowed.&quot; Several Russian military bloggers also reported the claims of a failed Ukrainian cross-border attempt. Belgorod Oblast authorities have repeatedly accused Ukraine of launching attacks against the region throughout the full-scale war. In 2023, Ukrainian-aligned militia groups carried out a series of temporary raids into Belgorod Oblast. Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, rejected Russia&#x2019;s claims in a post on Telegram. Border battles using artillery have been happening &quot;almost constantly&quot; throughout the full-scale invasion, Kovalenko wrote, adding the latest claim was a propaganda effort to paint Ukraine as uncooperative in peace efforts. &quot;It&#x2019;s not surprising that it&#x2019;s now very beneficial for the Russians to pump up the air before Trump&#x2019;s conversation with Putin. Their main information strategy is to accuse Ukraine of unwillingness to end the war, although in reality, they are attacking from the front, as well as from the air,&quot; he wrote. &quot;And it is Putin who is dragging his feet with Trump&apos;s proposal for a ceasefire.&quot; At a press conference, however, Zelensky neither confirmed nor denied Ukrainian operations in Belgorod Oblast when directly asked about Russia&#x2019;s claims. &quot;Ukraine is fulfilling its mission in the Kursk region,&quot; he said. &quot;We have seen a new concentration of troops on the border with Sumy Oblast. We can see what they want to do &#x2014; they want to strike Sumy, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. That is what we are seeing. Well, we will not let them do it so easily,&quot; Zelensky said. The claims added to mounting tensions in Ukraine&#x2019;s Sumy Oblast, which borders Russia&#x2019;s Belgorod, Kursk, and Bryansk oblasts. On March 15, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is amassing forces at the Sumy border to prepare for a new attack. Hours after the phone call with Trump in which Putin agreed to stop targeting energy infrastructure for 30 days, two hospitals within Sumy Oblast were among targets struck by Russian drones. In response, Zelensky said the attacks were evidence that &quot;Putin de facto rejected the proposal for a complete ceasefire.&quot; Residents in Sumy&#x2019;s vulnerable border communities experience multiple attacks per day. With the situation at the border escalating, Sumy Oblast&#x2019;s Defense Council expanded mandatory evacuations last week to include eight settlements in Sumy covering over 500 people.

In 24 hours, it had been attacked by 49 drones, 12 of which were intercepted, he claimed. His message did not include claims of an attempt at a cross-border incursion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-denies-russian-claims-of-a-thwarted-attempt-to-invade-russias-belgorod-heres-what-we-know/	2025-03-19T07:56:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167241344.jpg
Ukraine brings home 175 prisoners of war in swap with Russia	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. Ukraine has brought home 175 Ukrainian soldiers in a one-for-one prisoner exchange with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on March 19. Another 22 Ukrainian service members returned through negotiations outside of the one-for-one exchange. &quot;This is one of the largest exchanges. Our soldiers, sergeants and officers are returning. The soldiers who fought for our freedom in the Armed Forces, Navy, National Guard, Territorial Defense Forces and Border Guard,&quot; Zelensky wrote on Telegram.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-returns-175-ukrainian-service-members-from-russian-captivity/	2025-03-19T07:24:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-19-16_09_17.jpeg
Putin is playing a game here' — Germany's Pistorius criticizes Trump's ceasefire call with Moscow	Germany&apos;s Defense Minister Boris Pistorius on March 19 criticized the call between the U.S. and Russian presidents the day before, saying the partial ceasefire announced afterwards &quot;doesn&apos;t actually mean anything.&quot; Speaking to the German broadcaster ZDF, Pistorius said the call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin amounted to a &quot;nullnummer&quot; (a zero-zero-draw). Despite still not agreeing to a full 30-day ceasefire proposed by the U.S., the Kremlin said it had agreed to a 30-day pause in attacks on energy infrastructure. &quot;After this supposedly groundbreaking, great phone call, the Russian attacks have not decreased,&quot; Pistorius said, referencing drone strikes recorded across Ukraine overnight. &quot;So Putin is playing a game here, and I&apos;m sure the American president won&apos;t be able to stand by and watch for long without reacting,&quot; Pistorius said, adding he believes that Putin is playing for time to regroup his troops and weaken Ukraine&apos;s defense capability. The Kremlin has also demanded a complete cessation of foreign military aid and intelligence to Ukraine as a &quot;key condition for avoiding an escalation of the war,&quot; according to its statement released after the call. Elsewhere, current German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, standing by French President Emmanuel Macron in Berlin, welcomed news of the partial ceasefire agreement. Scholz called it an important &quot;first step&quot; towards a complete ceasefire, Deutsche Welle reported on March 18. Shortly after the call, air raid sirens blared, and explosions rocked Ukraine. Ukraine said that Moscow had launched as many as 145 attack and decoy drones, as well as six missiles, against Ukraine, of which 72 were shot down and 56 disappeared from radars. &quot;Today, Putin de facto rejected the proposal for a complete ceasefire. It would be right for the world to reject in response any attempts by Putin to drag out the war,&#x201D; President Volodymyr Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-is-playing-a-game-here-germanys-pistorius-criticizes-trumps-ceasefire-call-with-mosocw/	2025-03-19T07:19:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203131237.jpg
Ukraine ceasefire could be reached 'in a couple of weeks,' Witkoff says	A ceasefire in Ukraine could be reached within weeks, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, told Bloomberg TV on March 19. &quot;I actually think in a couple of weeks we&apos;re going to get to it (a ceasefire). So, lots of good things. Now, it&apos;s for the technical teams to dot the I&apos;s and cross the T&apos;s. And everybody is committed to that process,&quot; Witkoff said. His statement follows Trump&apos;s March 18 call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which the Russian leader agreed to a limited 30-day halt on energy infrastructure strikes but did not commit to the broader U.S.-proposed ceasefire. Following the call, the Kremlin reiterated its demand for a complete halt to foreign military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, calling it a &quot;key condition for avoiding an escalation of the war.&quot; Witkoff emphasized that achieving a full ceasefire depends on the 2,000-kilometer front line where Ukrainian and Russian forces are engaged in combat, noting that conditions vary significantly along different sections. &quot;We don&apos;t need to have the larger, overarching discussions that have been had. It was completed yesterday between the two leaders. They (Putin and Trump) agreed on a pathway to some ceasefire conditions today and to a full-on ceasefire that will be negotiated over the coming days,&quot; he said. The next round of U.S.-Russia talks is set to take place in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 23, Witkoff told Fox News on March 18. The discussions will be led by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, focusing on key ceasefire details. Witkoff did not confirm who the U.S. delegation would meet with. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 19 that the next meeting in Saudi Arabia could focus on discussing a partial ceasefire, particularly regarding infrastructure and energy and the security of shipping routes. &quot;It will be a technical team. From our side, there will definitely be military officials, engineers, and people who understand port infrastructure. This is the technical level,&quot; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ceasefire-in-ukraine-could-be-reached-in-a-couple-of-weeks-witkoff-says/	2025-03-19T07:14:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203660315.jpg
German government backs additional $3.3 billion in military aid for Ukraine	The outgoing German government agreed to release an additional 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) in military assistance for Ukraine, a German Finance Ministry spokesperson confirmed for the Kyiv Independent on March 19. Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz has long blocked the package unless it is financed by additional borrowing. Friedrich Merz, who is set to become the next chancellor after his conservative CDU/CSU alliance won the elections in February, voiced confidence that the additional assistance would be approved as he unveiled massive efforts to boost defense spending by reforming Germany&apos;s debt brake. Merz, who is seeking to build a new government coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD), scored a major win earlier this week after the outgoing parliament approved a spending surge that could unleash up to 500 billion euros ($545 billion) for Germany&apos;s defense. According to Reuters, the parliamentary budget committee should approve the funds for Ukraine on March 21, as long as the Bundesrat, a legislative body representing Germany&apos;s federal states, approves Merz&apos;s reforms. Germany is Ukraine&apos;s largest military donor in Europe, and its role is likely only to grow as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to reduce American involvement on the continent and restore ties with Russia. The 3-billion-euro package is in addition to the 4 billion euros ($4.36 billion) already allocated for Kyiv in 2025. Reuters reported earlier on March 19 that German Finance Minister Joerg Kukies has informed parliament&apos;s budget committee that the requirements for additional funds for Ukraine have been met. This was later confirmed by the ministry&apos;s spokesperson to the Kyiv Independent. The sum of 3 billion euros includes 2.547 billion euros ($2.8 billion) from the German budget, with the rest being reimbursed by the European Peace Facility. Kukies also plans to authorize some 8.252 billion euros ($8.9 billion) in military aid to Ukraine between 2026 and 2029.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-agrees-on-additional-3-3-billion-in-military-aid-for-ukraine/	2025-03-19T06:48:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198031078.jpg
US court blocks cuts to USAID, says Musk's DOGE likely violated Constitution	A U.S. federal court has barred further cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), ruling that its dismantling by Elon Musk&apos;s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) likely violated the U.S. Constitution, the Associated Press reported on March 19. The move follows the Trump administration&apos;s termination of 83% of USAID&apos;s foreign aid contracts while most of the agency&apos;s staff members have been laid off or placed on administrative leave. The dismantling of USAID had broad implications, particularly for Ukraine, where the agency has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and over $30 billion in direct budget support since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began. The court order requires the Trump administration to restore email and computer access to all USAID employees, including those on administrative leave. The move does not reinstate the agency in full or reverse staff firings. U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang in Maryland rejected the administration&apos;s claim that Musk, the world&apos;s richest man and DOGE chief, is merely an adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump. Chuang pointed to Musk&apos;s public statements and social media activity as evidence of his control over DOGE, citing a post in which Musk wrote that he had &quot;fed USAID into the wood chipper.&quot; Musk, a close Trump ally, has aggressively pushed to dismantle USAID, slashing staff and publicly attacking the agency&apos;s work. The ruling states that USAID is likely unable to perform its legally mandated functions due to these actions. &quot;Taken together, these facts support the conclusion that USAID has been effectively eliminated,&quot; Chuang wrote in the preliminary injunction. The lawsuit, filed by USAID employees and contractors, argues that Musk and DOGE exercise powers reserved by the Constitution for elected officials or Senate-confirmed appointees. Their attorneys said the ruling &quot;effectively halts or reverses&quot; many steps taken to shut down the agency. Judge Chuang also ruled that Musk&apos;s actions likely harmed the public interest by stripping Congress of its constitutional authority to determine whether, when, and how to close a government agency. The Trump administration&apos;s broader effort to curtail foreign aid has drawn criticism from health officials and humanitarian groups, who warn that such cuts will worsen global crises.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-court-blocks-cuts-to-usaid-ruling-musks-doge-likely-violated-the-constitution/	2025-03-19T06:19:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2197432945.jpg
Trump Jr., Witkoff, Carlson involved in secret talks with Zelensky's rivals, Politico reports	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s son, Donald Jr., news host Tucker Carlson, Trump&apos;s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and special envoy Steve Witkoff were involved in backchannel talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s political rivals, Politico reported on March 18, citing undisclosed sources. Politico reported back on March 6 that members of Trump&apos;s team led secret discussions with ex-President Petro Poroshenko&apos;s allies and former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko as the Trump administration grew displeased with Zelensky. These backchannel talks were part of an effort to make Zelensky more compliant and show that the U.S. has other potential partners in Ukraine, Politico reported. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Witkoff is the only person named by three Ukrainian lawmakers and a Republican foreign policy expert for Politico who holds an official position in Trump&apos;s team. Formally a special envoy for the Middle East, Witkoff has been involved in U.S. talks with both Russia and Ukraine. Carlson is a controversial, far-right host who repeatedly promoted anti-Ukrainian narratives and interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Trump Jr., the U.S. president&apos;s eldest son and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, has also often lashed out against U.S. support for Kyiv on social media. Kushner is a businessman and investor who served as Trump&apos;s advisor during his first administration and is married to the president&apos;s daughter, Ivanka Trump. According to the Politico sources, U.S. officials are convinced that Zelensky would lose elections if it were held today, despite numerous polls saying otherwise. Trump has repeatedly called for elections in Ukraine and, at one point, dubbed Zelensky a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; before seemingly walking back on that statement. These comments echo the Kremlin&apos;s propaganda about Zelensky&apos;s supposed illegitimacy. The Ukrainian Constitution does not permit elections under martial law, which was instituted at the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Recent opinion polls give Poroshenko and Tymoshenko slim chances of beating Zelensky if the vote was held today. One poll from February said that 44% of Ukrainians would vote for Zelensky in the first round, the highest number of all potential candidates. The incumbent president was followed by ex-Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi with 21%, Poroshenko with 10%, and Tymoshenko with 6%. Both Poroshenko and Tymoshenko acknowledged only public contacts with foreign partners, including the U.S., and rejected calls for holding elections during the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-jr-witkoff-tucker-carlson-involved-in-backchannel-talks-with-zelenskys-rivals-politico-reports/	2025-03-19T06:10:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2161596727.jpg
Trump’s push for regime change in Ukraine has only boosted Zelensky	The debate over Ukraine&#x2019;s elections and future leadership is intensifying. With peace talks gaining momentum, calls for elections are growing louder, and both the Russian and American sides are questioning Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s legitimacy. However, criticism from the Kremlin and the Oval Office has inadvertently solidified his position. For months, Zelensky&#x2019;s approval ratings, though always high, had been under pressure due to military setbacks, internal disputes, and questions over governance. That changed almost overnight. Recent polling shows a sharp rise in his ratings, with the increase directly tied to Ukraine&#x2019;s growing rift with the United States, creating a strong rally-round-the-flag effect. When U.S. President Donald Trump cast Zelensky as the obstacle to his &#x201C;instant peace&#x201D; plan, the Ukrainian president became a political martyr &#x2014; positioned as a leader standing up to a powerful external force demanding concessions. As seen in past crises, Ukrainian political survival depends on defiance, not accommodation. Zelensky is not alone in this. French President Emmanuel Macron sharpened his image as a European strongman by challenging Trump&#x2019;s America-first policies. In Canada, the governing Liberal Party gained 15% as Trump waged his campaign of threats and tariffs. Even U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has used his positioning as a &quot;bridge to Washington&quot; to consolidate his leadership. Politicians across the West are having their &#x201C;Love Actually&#x201D; moment, courtesy of Trump&#x2019;s bullying. Yet Zelensky is not merely posturing &#x2014; he is actively resisting U.S. pressure to accept terms that would weaken Ukraine&#x2019;s position. This resistance has transformed him from a leader facing difficult re-election prospects into a figure once again seen as indispensable. Trump wants Zelensky gone, but he faces a significant problem: Who would the U.S. want as its preferred candidate? The idea that Washington could simply appoint a pro-American successor reflects a misunderstanding of Ukraine&#x2019;s political landscape &#x2014; a mistake Russia has made repeatedly. The most likely contender is Yulia Tymoshenko, who has maintained political relevance through decades of reinvention. However, despite her longevity, Tymoshenko has never won a presidential election, and her appeal is increasingly limited to specific voter blocs. If Washington backed her, it would be backing a losing bet. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky answers questions from the media during a press conference in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 23, 2025. (Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)Another name emerging in speculation about private talks with the Trump administration is former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, Zelensky&#x2019;s primary political rival. Like Tymoshenko, Poroshenko is a fixture of Ukrainian politics &#x2014; an old-guard figure with a sizable anti-rating. His time as president left deep divisions, and while he remains influential, his chances of winning the presidency are slim. His polarizing legacy makes him an unlikely unifying candidate with little chance of securing a national mandate. That leaves former Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and current Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.K. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, frequently mentioned in speculation. However, the idea that Zaluzhnyi could become a pro-American candidate overlooks the reality of his position. Zaluzhnyi&#x2019;s primary allegiance is to Ukraine&#x2019;s military, not any foreign political agenda. Aligning too closely with U.S. demands &#x2014; especially those perceived as capitulatory &#x2014; would risk alienating the Ukrainian electorate and could potentially even be seen as treasonous by former Ukrainian military comrades. While Zelensky is often criticized for his domestic policies and personnel choices, in foreign policy, he channels the will of the Ukrainian people. His firm stance earns him their trust. Sure, another negotiator could be sent, but they would lack legitimacy and largely share the same position. If a leader were to concede to Russian demands, history suggests they wouldn&#x2019;t last long. Ukraine has a well-established tradition of overthrowing leaders who serve Russian interests (see the Orange Revolution and the Revolution of Dignity). Any deal would need not just a president&#x2019;s signature; it would require the backing of the Ukrainian people. More importantly, it would need the acceptance of Ukraine&#x2019;s military &#x2014; one million men and women who have sacrificed too much to take orders from a Trump-anointed puppet. If Washington believes it can install a leader who tells them to lay down their weapons, why would they listen? Why wouldn&#x2019;t they turn their guns (and shiny Western tanks) on them instead? The idea that Ukraine&#x2019;s war can be resolved by simply reshuffling its leadership is naive at best, and at worst, a recipe for even greater chaos. The irony is that those most eager to see Zelensky replaced &#x2014; whether in Washington or Moscow &#x2014; may have done the most to secure his continued leadership. Attempts to sideline him and paint him as an obstacle to negotiations have only strengthened his position. Just as external pressure has historically galvanized Ukrainian resistance, it has also cemented Zelensky&#x2019;s role at the helm. With no viable pro-American alternative and no serious internal challengers gaining momentum, the Ukrainian president appears poised to remain in power for the foreseeable future.

Ukraine to compile list of energy sites Russia must stop attacking, Zelensky says	Ukraine will compile a list of energy, infrastructure, and civilian sites that Russia must cease attacking and present the document to international partners, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on March 19. &quot;And if the Russians don&apos;t hit our facilities, we won&apos;t hit their facilities,&quot; Zelensky said during a joint press conference with Finnish President Alexander Stubb in Helsinki. His statement follows Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s pledge during a March 18 call with U.S. President Donald Trump to pause strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure for 30 days. Despite this commitment, Zelensky noted that Russia launched a large-scale assault on Ukraine&apos;s infrastructure overnight on March 19. The Ukrainian leader stressed that Ukraine expects the United States to take a leading role in monitoring Russia&apos;s compliance. &quot;An example is yesterday&apos;s strike after Putin said there would be no strikes on energy and civilian infrastructure. He said he had given the order. And after that, there were 145 attack drones, four S-300 missiles, two Iskander ballistic missiles,&quot; Zelensky said. Russian forces have systematically targeted Ukraine&apos;s civilian energy infrastructure since 2022, intensifying their aerial campaign in recent months with nightly drone and missile attacks. Ukrainian authorities reported that the latest strikes hit energy facilities, hospitals, and civilian infrastructure, causing outages in the Donetsk Oblast city of Sloviansk. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry accused Ukraine of launching three drones at an energy facility in Krasnodar Krai on March 19, resulting in a fire. Moscow labeled the attack a &quot;provocation&quot; aimed at disrupting Trump&apos;s ongoing peace efforts. Zelensky is set to speak with Trump later on March 19 and expects to receive details on Trump&apos;s phone conversation with Putin.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-create-list-of-energy-infrastructure-civilian-sites-russia-must-cease-attacking-zelensky-says/	2025-03-19T05:41:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1247442902-1677276960d6gz6.jpg
RFE/RL sues Trump administration over funding cuts	Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) sued the United States Agency for Global Media (USAGM) on March 18 over the termination of grant funding, calling the action unconstitutional. The congressionally authorized grant funding for RFE/RL has been terminated after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the USAGM, a government agency overseeing RFE/RL, Radio Free Asia, and Voice of America, to be dismantled. RFE/RL was founded early in the Cold War to counter Soviet propaganda in Eastern Bloc countries. It has since continued providing coverage of Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, and countries in Central Asia, the Balkans, the Caucasus, and elsewhere. The outlet argues that the Trump administration&apos;s decision violates the Constitution as the funding was approved by Congress. &quot;This is not the time to cede terrain to the propaganda and censorship of America&#x2019;s adversaries. We believe the law is on our side and that the celebration of our demise by despots around the world is premature,&quot; said RFE/RL President and CEO Stephen Capus. Trump&apos;s crackdown against RFE/RL and VoA, which has been celebrated by Russian propagandists, coincides with his outreach to Moscow as he seeks to broker a peace deal in Ukraine. U.S. courts have previously sought to stall some of the executive&apos;s most radical cuts, which were presented as an effort to slash waste, including the gutting of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Trump&apos;s allies have publicly questioned the court&apos;s jurisdiction over the executive branch&apos;s decisions, raising concerns about a looming constitutional crisis. As the future of U.S. legal battles remains uncertain, European countries launched discussions on stepping in and taking over the outlet&apos;s funding needs. &quot;Do we see value in such an organization, broadcasting to countries like Russia, Belarus, Iran, and many others? And if we see such value, what are we willing to do to keep such a service in our favor?&quot; Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said. RFE/RL&apos;s headquarters is located in Prague. Martin Dvorak, the Czech European affairs minister, said that the Czech initiative to fund RFE/RL has already received backing from 10 countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/rfe-rl-sues-trump-administration-over-funding-cuts/	2025-03-19T05:02:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-87128053.jpg
EU, UNDP unveil interactive online exhibition about Ukraine’s rescuers and police officers	The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Ukraine, in partnership with the European Union (EU), has launched an interactive online exhibition titled &#x201C;Moments Before,&#x201D; offering an in-depth look into the work of Ukraine&#x2019;s first responders and police officers amid Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war against Ukraine. The exhibition features contributions from units of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine and the National Police of Ukraine in the cities of Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia, and Mykolaiv. Through a series of documentary photographs and personal testimonies, the exhibition immerses viewers in the daily realities of emergency response teams. It goes beyond their immediate duties &#x2014; clearing the aftermath of attacks, evacuating civilians, demining territories, maintaining public order, and working with canine units &#x2014; to reveal the human side of their work. The project delves into what rescuers and police officers experience in their most critical moments, how they manage psychological and physical pressure, what their mission means to them, and what keeps them going despite the immense challenges. The exhibition aims to capture the emotional and psychological dimensions of their work, offering audiences a closer look at the people who risk their lives daily to protect others. It presents them not only as skilled professionals but also as individuals &#x2014; people who face fear and exhaustion, yet remain steadfast in their duty, driven by determination and commitment. Head of Cooperation at the EU Delegation to Ukraine Stefan Schleuning noted that the exhibition highlights an aspect, often overlooked in the work of police officers and first responders in Ukraine &#x2013; their personal struggles. &#x201C;Rescuers and police officers put their lives on the line every day, and we are used to seeing them in action. But behind this, there is a world of emotions, pressure, and fatigue &#x2014; things that statistics and numbers cannot capture. This project allows us to see their work not just as a duty but through a deeply human perspective,&#x201D; said Schleuning. UNDP Resident Representative in Ukraine Jaco Cilliers highlighted that the exhibition reflects broader changes taking place in Ukrainian society. &#x201C;Rescuers and police officers do more than respond to emergencies &#x2014; they help communities adapt to the realities of war. Their role extends beyond their standard responsibilities, and it is crucial to support them not only with resources, but also by fostering resilience and development. At UNDP, with the support of partners such as the European Union, we are committed to this mission,&#x201D; Cilliers said. The exhibition was developed as part of the flagship EU-UNDP partnership &#x201C;EU4Recovery &#x2013; Empowering Communities in Ukraine,&#x201D; in collaboration with the State Emergency Service and the National Police in Ukraine). The project was implemented by the Vandog Agency.

Russia claims it downed 7 own drones to uphold energy ceasefire; Kyiv says Moscow launched 145	Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on March 19 that its forces downed seven Russian drones sent to attack Ukrainian energy facilities after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a temporary pause on such strikes. In turn, Ukraine said that Moscow had launched as many as 145 attack and decoy drones, as well as six missiles, against Ukraine, of which 72 were shot down and 56 disappeared from radars. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the drones targeted energy facilities, hospitals, and civilian infrastructure. Outages were reported in the Donetsk Oblast city of Sloviansk. Putin publicly agreed to a 30-day halt on attacks against energy facilities following his phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump on March 18. The Kremlin nevertheless refused Washington&apos;s proposal for a full temporary ceasefire as it insisted on a complete halt of military support flowing to Ukraine. &quot;Putin&#x2019;s words are very different from reality,&quot; Zelensky said during a press conference with Finnish President Alexander Stubb, urging continued military support for Ukraine. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, seven drones were in the air and sent to attack Ukrainian energy facilities in Mykolaiv Oblast. Six were allegedly downed by a Pantsir air defense system and one by a Russian fighter jet. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the reported attack in Krasnodar Krai.

US reportedly assures EU about role in Ukraine peace talks as Russia seeks sanctions relief	The U.S. has signaled that European partners will be included in peace talks on the war in Ukraine, as Russia pushes for the lifting of EU-imposed sanctions, Bloomberg reported on March 18, citing unnamed sources. The move may reassure European leaders, who have expressed concerns that the U.S. would attempt to broker a deal without their involvement. So far, U.S. President Donald Trump has largely excluded Europe from his direct conversations with Ukraine and Russia. The EU&#x2019;s sanctions framework includes economic measures and restrictions on over 2,400 individuals and entities linked to Russia. Moscow has sought to have these penalties lifted as part of a negotiation process. According to Bloomberg, Washington has made it clear to European partners that its immediate priority is to halt hostilities in Ukraine. Only after a ceasefire is secured would discussions on security guarantees take place. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio claimed on March 10 that the U.S. has discussed easing the sanctions on Russia with the EU. Trump previously said on March 7 that he is considering imposing additional banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and peace agreement are reached. Since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has faced sweeping economic sanctions from both the U.S. and the EU, targeting key industries, financial institutions, and individuals close to the Kremlin.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-reportedly-signals-eu-role-in-ukraine-peace-talks-as-russia-seeks-sanctions-relief/	2025-03-19T03:40:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-688109050.jpg
Zelensky announces talk with Trump on March 19	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky will speak with U.S. President Donald Trump on March 19, Zelensky said during a joint press conference with Finnish President Alexander Stubb. &quot;Today, I will contact President Trump. We will discuss the details of the next steps. We had a really good meeting between our teams in Jeddah. I believe everything was going in the right direction, if not for Russia, which is always unhappy when something goes right,&quot; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-trump-to-hold-a-conversation-on-march-19/	2025-03-19T03:26:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201813711.jpg
Nordics, Baltics urge concrete steps toward Ukraine's EU membership	Six EU member countries are urging the European Union to provide concrete steps to accelerate Ukraine&apos;s accession process, Politico reported on March 18, citing a joint letter it had obtained. In the letter, the foreign ministers of Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia called on Brussels to put forward &quot;concrete proposals on how to decisively advance Ukraine&apos;s accession process.&quot; Ukraine applied for EU membership in 2022 and was granted candidate status within months. Accession talks began in June 2024, with European leaders setting 2030 as a target for Ukraine&apos;s potential entry. &quot;Reaffirming full and unequivocal commitment to the EU membership perspective of Ukraine, we call for accelerating the accession process,&quot; the letter reads. &quot;The time has come for ambitious and effective decisions in this regard.&quot; The diplomats emphasized that EU enlargement should remain &quot;predictable and based on own merits&quot; and that bilateral disputes should not be used to block progress but instead resolved through good-faith dialogue. Despite broad EU support for Ukraine&apos;s accession, Hungary remains a major obstacle. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced on March 7 that his government would conduct an opinion survey on Ukraine&apos;s potential EU membership. Orban, widely regarded as the EU&apos;s most Russian-friendly leader, has repeatedly opposed military aid for Ukraine and warned that Kyiv&apos;s accession would &quot;destroy&quot; Hungary. He has also maintained warm ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin despite Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, frequently amplifying Kremlin narratives in Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/northern-european-countries-demand-concrete-steps-for-ukraines-eu-membership/	2025-03-19T02:46:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1252156264.jpg
US scales down efforts in countering Russian sabotage, Reuters reports	Some U.S. national security agencies have suspended cooperation with international partners in countering Russian sabotage and cyber operations, Reuters reported on March 19, citing undisclosed official sources. The news comes amid the Trump administration&apos;s efforts to restore ties with Russia while seeking to broker a swift peace deal in Ukraine. Under former U.S. President Joe Biden, the National Security Council coordinated the effort of at least seven security agencies, who worked with European partners to disrupt Russia&apos;s escalating hybrid activities across the European continent. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s team was briefed by the Biden administration on Russian disruptive activities during a transition period, according to Reuters. Since Trump took office on Jan. 20, the National Security Council has ceased coordinating these efforts while expected meetings with European partners did not happen, Reuters wrote. The news agency noted that it remains unclear whether this was a direct decision by the Trump administration or individual initiative of the relevant agencies. The news follows earlier reporting claiming that U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a halt to all cyber operations against Russia. The Pentagon later denied the claim. The U.S. has also reportedly cut support for a group tracking Ukrainian children abducted by Russia, moved to withdraw from a body investigating the Russian leadership for crimes in Ukraine, and froze USAID funding crucial for various humanitarian, economic, and social projects in the country. Washington has also temporarily paused military and intelligence support for Ukraine earlier this month to push it to the negotiating table. The U.S. has threatened additional sanctions against Russia unless it agrees to a ceasefire but has yet to take the step, putting considerably greater pressure on Ukraine. Trump&apos;s outreach to Moscow has caused concerns in Europe and Kyiv that Washington might cut a peace deal unfavorable to the U.S.&apos;s allies. On March 18, Trump held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss a pause on strikes against both Ukrainian and Russian energy facilities, as well as the prospects of U.S.-Russian economic cooperation.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-scales-down-efforts-in-countering-russian-sabotage-reuters-reports/	2025-03-19T02:34:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1813426206.jpg
46% of Americans think US support for Ukraine is insufficient, poll finds	Nearly half of Americans believe the U.S. is not doing enough to support Ukraine, while two-thirds would favor increased military aid if Russia violates a potential ceasefire, according to a Gallup poll published on March 18. The survey comes as the Trump administration has yet to approve any new aid packages for Kyiv as it seeks to restore ties with Moscow. The weapons currently flowing to Ukraine were authorized under the former Biden administration. According to the poll, 46% of Americans believe Washington is not providing sufficient assistance to Ukraine &#x2014; 16% more than in December. Meanwhile, the number of those who think U.S. support is excessive (30%) or sufficient (23%) has decreased. Among Democrats, 79% believe the U.S. should be doing more, compared to 46% of independents and just 12% of Republicans. Analysts attribute this shift to U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s approach to the war. The poll was conducted from March 3 to 11, following the failed White House talks between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky and Washington&apos;s announcement of a pause in military aid. The highest recorded dissatisfaction with U.S. support for Ukraine was 38% in August 2022. Now, 53% of Americans say the U.S. should back Ukraine until all its territories are restored, even if it takes time. This position is held by 82% of Democrats, 54% of independents, and 22% of Republicans. Regarding the proposed ceasefire, 79% of respondents fear Russia will violate the agreement, and 70% believe any deal could favor Moscow. If Russia breaks the truce, 64% of Americans would support an increase in military aid to Ukraine, 42% would back airstrikes on Russian military facilities in Ukraine, and 30% would favor deploying U.S. troops. Trump said during a meeting with Zelensky in Washington on Feb. 28 &#xA0;that security guarantees for Ukraine would be Europe&apos;s responsibility. Rising support for Ukraine among the American public could pressure the Trump administration to shift its policy, mainly if Russia violates a possible ceasefire, analysts said. Meanwhile, a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on March 13 found that 56% of Americans believe Trump is &quot;too closely aligned&quot; with Russia amid his administration&apos;s evolving foreign policy.	https://kyivindependent.com/46-of-americans-think-us-support-for-ukraine-is-insufficient-poll-finds/	2025-03-19T01:57:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1244028095.jpg
Poroshenko attacks Zelensky over sanctions; says Ukraine must stay on defensive	Former President Petro Poroshenko called sanctions imposed against him by the Ukrainian government an &quot;attack on freedom and democracy&quot; in an interview with the German tabloid Bild published on March 18. Poroshenko, head of the opposition European Solidarity party and Ukraine&apos;s president between 2014 and 2019, was among several politicians and oligarchs sanctioned by Kyiv in February. The media speculated that the sanctions against Poroshenko were connected to his high treason case. The ex-president&apos;s assets have been frozen, and he says he is not allowed to leave the country. &quot;What is happening here is unconstitutional, it is illegal, there is no court decision,&quot; Poroshenko claimed in the interview. When asked about U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s accusations toward President Volodymyr Zelensky, Poroshenko responded, &quot;If you ask me about a dictatorship, the answer is clear &#x2013; the dictator is (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.&quot; At the same time, Poroshenko accused Zelensky&apos;s team of &quot;moving the country toward dictatorship&quot; while denouncing the sanctions imposed against him. Trump has falsely accused Zelensky of being a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; on account of not holding a presidential vote during wartime. Ukraine&apos;s Constitution prohibits elections under martial law, which was instituted at the outbreak of Russia&apos;s full-scale war in 2022. Trump&apos;s public attack on Zelensky was followed by rumors that the U.S. president&apos;s team has been secretly in contact with Ukrainian opposition figures, including senior members of Poroshenko&apos;s party. Poroshenko acknowledged only &quot;public and transparent&quot; contacts with U.S. partners and rejected the possibility of holding elections during martial law. The businessman and owner of the confectionery manufacturing group Roshen was defeated by Zelensky by a landslide in the 2019 elections. Since then, the two have remained bitter political rivals, often resorting to verbal attacks. One of the recent opinion polls showed Poroshenko&apos;s support at 10%, below ex-Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi (21%) and Zelensky (44%.) Poroshenko was charged in 2021 with high treason and aiding terrorist organizations for allegedly conspiring with Russian-backed separatists between November 2014 and January 2015. The scheme reportedly generated over Hr 3 billion ($72 million) in profits from coal supplies. If found guilty, Poroshenko could face 10 to 15 years in prison. Speaking about the battlefield situation, Poroshenko said that Ukraine &quot;must immediately stop losing people and immediately stop losing territory.&quot; &quot;Defending the territory is the top priority. Use fortifications, minefields, and the most modern anti-aircraft defenses against guided bombs,&quot; the ex-president added, saying that Ukraine should &quot;forget the word &apos;offensive operation.&apos;&quot; Ukraine has been resisting Russian onslaught across a more than 1,000-kilometer-long front for more than three years. Earlier this month, Ukraine lost significant positions in the Russian border region of Kursk, which it attacked last August.	https://kyivindependent.com/poroshenko-attacks-zelensky-over-sanctions-says-ukraine-must-go-on-defensive/	2025-03-19T01:36:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2055613178.jpg
US may relinquish leadership of NATO's European command, NBC reports	The Trump administration is considering scrapping the longstanding role of the U.S. in leading NATO&apos;s military operations in Europe, NBC News reported on March 18, citing unnamed defense officials. For nearly 75 years, a four-star U.S. general has held the position of Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), overseeing NATO&apos;s military strategy and operations. According to two defense officials familiar with internal discussions and a Pentagon briefing reviewed by NBC News, the administration is evaluating whether to relinquish this post as part of a broader effort to reduce U.S. commitments in Europe. Retired Admiral James Stavridis, who served as SACEUR from 2009 to 2013, warned that such a move would dramatically weaken U.S. influence within the alliance. &quot;We would lose an enormous amount of influence within NATO, and this would be seen, correctly, as probably the first step toward leaving the alliance altogether,&quot; Stavridis said. The potential shift follows repeated calls by U.S. President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for NATO allies to assume greater responsibility for Europe&apos;s defense. If Washington abandons the SACEUR role, NATO members would have to determine which European country would nominate a new supreme commander. The Pentagon has not commented on the matter. Trump has long demanded that NATO allies increase their military spending. He previously called for the alliance to raise its benchmark from 2% to 5% of the GDP. Italy, Canada, and Spain remain below the current 2% target. Some NATO members are reportedly considering raising the spending target to 3% by 2030. In 2023, Trump suggested that Russia should be allowed to &quot;do whatever the hell they want&quot; to alliance members failing to meet their defense obligations, a statement widely interpreted as undermining NATO&apos;s unity.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-may-relinquish-leadership-in-nato-military-command-nbc-reports/	2025-03-19T01:18:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-996942026-1.jpg
Ukrainian drone strike halts operations at Russia's Krasnodar Krai oil station, authorities claim	Ukrainian drones attacked the Kavkazskaya oil pumping station in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai overnight on March 19, damaging infrastructure and causing fire, pro-Kremlin news outlet Shot and regional authorities claimed. The attack reportedly damaged a pipeline connecting storage tanks, sparking a fire that covered an area of about 20 square meters. The regional operational headquarters confirmed that 30 on-duty personnel were evacuated and that the facility suspended operations. No casualties have been reported. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the reported attacks. The Kavkazskaya oil transshipment point is crucial in Russia&apos;s energy exports, connecting a railroad oil terminal and the Kropotkinskaya oil pumping station. It is part of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium system, which pumps up to 6 million metric tons of oil annually. The strike follows Ukraine&apos;s Feb. 17 drone attack on the Kropotkinskaya oil pumping station, also in Krasnodar Krai, where seven drones reportedly hit key infrastructure. Kyiv has intensified its campaign against Russia&apos;s energy and military infrastructure to disrupt Moscow&apos;s war effort. On March 17, Ukrainian drones struck a fuel and energy facility in Russia&apos;s Astrakhan Oblast, igniting a fire, regional Governor Igor Babushkin claimed. The attack comes as both Kyiv and Moscow signaled openness to a mutual halt on strikes against the energy sector. The same night, Russia launched 145 drones and six missiles against Ukraine, inflicting civilian casualties and damaging infrastructure. Ukraine has consistently targeted Russian refineries, oil depots, and defense industry sites, aiming to limit Russia&apos;s ability to sustain its full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drone-strike-halts-operations-at-russias-kavkazskaya-oil-station/	2025-03-19T00:28:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/Krasnodar-Krai-March-19.png
2 killed, 18 injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least two civilians and injured at least 18 over the past day, regional authorities reported on March 19. Russia launched two Iskander-M ballistic missiles, four S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, and 145 attack and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 72 drones over 12 oblasts, while 56 decoy drones disappeared from radars without causing damage, according to the statement. The Air Force did not comment on the consequences of the missile strikes. Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast injured three people in Sloviansk late on March 18, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Part of the city was reportedly left without electricity, even as Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed with U.S. President Donald Trump to temporarily halt energy strikes against Ukraine a few hours earlier. In Kharkiv Oblast, a 45-year-old woman was killed and four people were injured when a Russian first-person-view (FPV) drone hit a service car of a utility company on the Kupiansk-Kindrashivka highway, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Houses, a warehouse, tractors, and cars were damaged elsewhere in the region. Seven people were injured in Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Four apartment buildings and 29 houses were damaged. A 60-year-old man was injured during strikes in the Bucha district of Kyiv Oblast, according to the regional military administration. Nine houses were damaged or partially destroyed in three different settlements of the district. A hospital in Ukraine&apos;s northeastern city of Sumy and another in the town of Krasnopillia in Sumy Oblast were hit by drones, authorities said. Patients have been evacuated, and no injuries were reported. The blast in Sumy also damaged the premises of a children&apos;s medical facility, according to the State Emergency Service. Separately, a Russian attack on the village of Uhroidy in the Krasnopillia community killed one person, injured three, and damaged a two-story house, the regional military administration reported. On the morning of March 19, Russian drones struck the railway power grid in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, causing partial outages but not disrupting train schedules, Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia) announced.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-135/	2025-03-19T00:10:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-19_07-20-30.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 898,070 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 898,070 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on March 19. The number includes 1,060 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,364 tanks, 21,523 armored fighting vehicles, 41,003 vehicles and fuel tanks, 24,704 artillery systems, 1,320 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,107 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 29,716 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-898-070-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-03-18T23:52:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192142645.jpg
Trump administration cuts funding for initiative tracking Russian abductions of Ukrainian children, WP reports	The Trump administration has ended U.S. government funding for an initiative that tracked Russian war crimes, including the forced deportation of Ukrainian children, the Washington Post (WP) reported on March 18. The program, led by Yale University&#x2019;s Humanitarian Research Lab under the State Department&#x2019;s Conflict Observatory, collected biometric data and satellite imagery to document Russia&#x2019;s abduction of Ukrainian children. Researchers lost access to the database last month after officials terminated the contract, cutting off critical evidence from investigators pursuing war crimes cases, the WP reported. Lawmakers are alarmed that the research lab&#x2019;s database may have been permanently deleted, jeopardizing efforts to locate the children and hold those responsible accountable. A group of U.S. representatives, including Democrat Greg Landsman, warned Secretary of State Marco Rubio that losing the data would have &quot;devastating consequences,&quot; according to a copy of the letter obtained by the WP. The database, which contained detailed dossiers on thousands of Ukrainian children taken to Russia, was being transferred to Europol to support international prosecutions. However, the funding cut blocked that process. The Observatory&#x2019;s research has been a key source of evidence for international investigations. It contributed to multiple reports on Russia&#x2019;s actions in Ukraine and played a role in securing six International Criminal Court (ICC) indictments, including the 2023 arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his commissioner for children&#x2019;s rights, Maria Lvova-Belova. The ICC accused them of overseeing the unlawful deportation of Ukrainian children, an act Ukraine considers an attempt to erase their national identity. Despite Moscow&#x2019;s claims that it relocates children from combat zones for their safety, Ukraine and human rights groups argue that Russia is systematically adopting and indoctrinating them. Putin even signed a decree in 2022, making it easier for Russian families to adopt Ukrainian children. The Observatory&#x2019;s reports identified at least 35,000 children affected by these forced transfers, with researchers insisting that their findings are crucial for Ukraine&#x2019;s efforts to bring them home. The Ukrainian government has managed to return 1,240 children so far, according to the Ukrainian national database &quot;Children of War.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-administration-cuts-funding-for-initiative-tracking-russian-abductions-of-ukrainian-children-wp-reports/	2025-03-18T21:46:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1241879367-1661793078wugow.jpg
2 Sumy Oblast hospitals hit by drones hours after Putin agrees to halt energy grid attacks	A hospital in Ukraine&apos;s northeastern city of Sumy and another in the town of Krasnopillia were hit by drones during a series of attacks on Ukraine, prompting President Volodymyr Zelensky to accuse Vladimir Putin of de facto rejecting a ceasefire. No casualties were reported following the Sumy Oblast strikes at the time of publication. First responders have been dispatched to the sites of the attacks. This came after a call between U.S. President Donald Trump and the Russian president, in which Putin had agreed to halt strikes on Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure. The Kremlin had announced that Putin had given immediate orders to cease such attacks. However, shortly after the call, air raid sirens blared, and explosions rocked Ukraine. Zelensky confirmed the strikes targeted civilian infrastructure. Local reports indicated that power infrastructure in Donetsk Oblast&apos;s Slovyansk was damaged, causing partial blackouts. According to Zelensky, over 40 Russian drones were launched in the assault. &quot;It is precisely such night attacks by Russia that destroy our energy systems, our infrastructure, the normal life of Ukrainians. And the fact that this night was no exception shows that pressure must continue on Russia for the sake of peace,&quot; he said. &quot;Today, Putin de facto rejected the proposal for a complete ceasefire. It would be right for the world to reject in response any attempts by Putin to drag out the war,&#x201D; the president said. Sumy Oblast borders Russia&apos;s Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod oblasts. Residents of the vulnerable border communities experience multiple attacks per day.	https://kyivindependent.com/2-sumy-oblast-hospitals-hit-by-drones-hours-after-putin-agrees-to-halt-energy-grid-attacks/	2025-03-18T21:12:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-18-21_57_34.jpeg
China signals willingness to aid Ukraine’s post-war reconstruction	China has delivered four batches of humanitarian aid to Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s all-out war, Li Ming, spokesperson for the China International Development Cooperation Agency, said on March 18. China remains committed to being a &quot;positive force for world peace and stability and a progressive force for global fairness and justice,&quot; Li reportedly said, addressing reports that President Volodymyr Zelensky had expressed hopes for China&apos;s involvement in restoring peace and supporting Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction. &quot;We are ready to continue to provide assistance within our capacity according to the wishes of parties involved, which, of course, includes post-war reconstruction,&quot; he added. Beijing has positioned itself as a neutral party in the war, calling for diplomatic solutions while maintaining ties with Moscow. China has deepened its ties with Russia since the start of the Kremlin&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine and has become Moscow&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry. Western officials remain wary of Beijing&apos;s deepening ties with Moscow, with NATO labeling China a &quot;decisive enabler&quot; of Russia&apos;s war.	https://kyivindependent.com/china-expresses-readiness-to-aid-ukraines-post-war-reconstruction/	2025-03-18T20:22:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1555636976.jpg
US-Russia ceasefire talks set for March 23 in Jeddah, US envoy Witkoff says	U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News on March 18 that diplomatic talks between the U.S. and Russia will take place on March 23 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The discussions, led by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, will focus on key details regarding the ceasefire. It remains unclear whether Ukraine will be invited to the talks. &quot;Up until recently, we really didn&apos;t have consensus around these two aspects - the energy and infrastructure ceasefire and the Black Sea moratorium on firing - and today we got to that place, and I think it&apos;s a relatively short distance to a full ceasefire from there,&quot; Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s special envoy to the Middle East, said on air. Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to a 30-day halt on strikes against energy infrastructure during a call with Trump, according to a Kremlin readout issued on March 18. The statement followed the 1.5-hour phone call between Putin and Trump, during which they discussed ending the war in Ukraine and the U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire to allow for further peace talks. &quot;During the conversation, Donald Trump proposed a mutual refusal of the parties to the conflict to strike for 30 days on energy infrastructure facilities,&quot; the statement read. &quot;Vladimir Putin responded positively to this initiative and immediately gave the appropriate command to the Russian military.&quot; The Kremlin also said Putin &quot;responded constructively to Donald Trump&apos;s idea of &#x200B;&#x200B;implementing a well-known initiative concerning the safety of navigation in the Black Sea.&quot; &quot;It was agreed to begin negotiations to further elaborate specific details of such an agreement,&quot; the statement added.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-russia-ceasefire-talks-set-for-march-23-in-jeddah-us-envoy-witkoff-says/	2025-03-18T18:58:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196945288.jpg
Putin didn't mention military aid in phone call, Trump says	Russian President Vladimir Putin did not discuss military aid to Ukraine during his phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, according to an interview Trump gave with Fox News following the call. Trump and Putin spoke for nearly two hours on March 18. During the call, Putin agreed to accept a limited 30-day pause on energy infrastructure attacks but did not agree to the broader ceasefire proposed by the U.S. The Kremlin later issued a statement demanding Ukraine stop receiving foreign military aid as a condition of the ceasefire. In an interview with Fox News correspondent Laura Ingraham following the call, Trump denied that Putin demanded a freeze on military aid to Kyiv. &quot;No he didn&apos;t, we didn&apos;t talk about aid, actually we didn&apos;t talk about aid at all,&quot; Trump said. &quot;We talked about a lot of things, but aid was never discussed.&quot; Trump described the conversation as &quot;a great call&quot; and said that other topics included improving U.S.-Russian relations and expanding trade. &quot;With Russia we don&apos;t have that much trade, and they&apos;d like to, and we&apos;d like to also,&quot; he said. &quot;They have some valuable things for us, including very big forms of rare earth. They have a lot of earth, you know. They have a big chunk of real estate. The biggest, actually. The biggest in the world, for a country, by far. And on that, they have things that we could use, frankly, and other people could use.&quot; Trump has previously expressed interest in exploring Russia&apos;s significant mineral deposits, even as he simultaneously pursues a natural resources deal with Kyiv. Putin also said on Feb. 24 that Moscow is open to working with foreign partners on developing rare earth metals, including in occupied regions of Ukraine. After the March 18 call, the Kremlin issued a statement saying Trump and Putin were open to developing &quot;mutually beneficial cooperation in the economy and energy sector.&quot; &quot;I think Russia wants to get along with the United States,&quot; Trump told Fox News. Russia is interested in gaining accesss to American &quot;economic power,&quot; he added. While Trump denied that Putin personally demanded a freeze on military aid to Ukraine during the phone call, he did not say whether the U.S. would agree to such a demand. The U.S. earlier this month suspended military aid and intelligence sharing to Ukraine for a week following a White House clash between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. The U.S. resumed sending weapons and intelligence after Ukrainian officials held talks with a White House delegation in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on March 11.

I don't want us to be on Putin's menu' — Zelensky says negotiations must include Ukraine	Ukraine must be included in all future negotiations regarding steps to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a virtual press conference on March 18. Zelensky&apos;s comments followed a phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who discussed the possibilities of a temporary ceasefire. Afterwards, Washington and Moscow announced that they planned to hold negotiations in the Middle East &quot;immediately.&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t want to offend anyone, but I don&apos;t want us to be on Putin&apos;s menu,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;We are not a salad ... We are an independent state. Without us, I think it&apos;s wrong to negotiate.&quot; In his call with Trump, Putin said he was prepared to accept a 30-day pause on all attacks targeting energy infrastructure &#x2014; a proposal Zelensky signaled he was willing to accept, once Kyiv was briefed on the details. Following the call, the White House and the Kremlin issued separate statements both affirming plans to hold peace negotiations in the Middle East. The talks will focus on the energy sector ceasefire and steps towards implementing a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea. Ukraine supports any proposals that lead to a just peace, Zelensky said, and must not be excluded from these negotiations. &quot;We must understand what is going on. ... Because in this war, there are two sides. Russia and Ukraine. And without Ukraine, it seems to me that it is hopeless to negotiate.&quot; Zelensky also said that Putin&apos;s rejection of the first U.S. ceasefire plan &#x2014;&#xA0;a 30-day cessation of all hostilities, which Ukraine agreed to on March 11 &#x2014; illustrated Russia&apos;s disinterest in ending the war. &quot;If you didn&apos;t want to continue the war on March 11, the numbers would probably be different,&quot; he said. &quot;And the numbers are as follows: 1342 KABs, eight rockets, 580 Shaheds, 44 Lancets, 250 other strikes. Not on the battlefield &#x2014; we are talking about everything, about civilian infrastructure.&quot; Zelensky said that despite Putin&apos;s demand that Ukraine stop receiving military aid in order to advance a ceasefire agreement, Kyiv expects its allies to continue providing security assistance. He also confirmed Putin&apos;s announcement that Ukraine and Russia would each exchange 175 prisoners on March 19.	https://kyivindependent.com/i-dont-want-us-to-be-on-putins-menu-zelensky-says-negotiations-must-include-ukraine/	2025-03-18T16:25:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2205000398.jpg
Kyiv supports energy sector ceasefire, expects military aid to continue, Zelensky says	Ukraine is willing to agree to a 30-day pause on attacks on energy infrastructure, but needs more details of the agreement, President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters in an online press briefing on March 18. Zelensky&apos;s remarks came after U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed a possible ceasefire in a phone call earlier that day. During the call, Putin said he would agree to a 30-day pause on energy infrastructure attacks. &quot;We will support such a proposal, but we&apos;re very interested in the details,&quot; Zelensky said via teleconference from Finland. &quot;What is the real proposal, what did the parties agree on? ... After we get the details from the American president, from the American side, we will prepare our answer and the team will be ready for technical talks.&quot; Russia has been bombing Ukraine&apos;s civilian energy infrastructure since 2022. In recent months, Moscow has intensified aerial campaigns with bombardments by swarms of Shahed drones a nightly occurrence. Zelensky noted during his briefing that there was an active air raid alert in Ukraine at that very moment. Following Putin&apos;s call with Trump, the Kremlin issued a statement demanding that Ukraine stop receiving all military aid and foreign intelligence as a &quot;key condition for avoiding an escalation of the war.&quot; Zelensky said he believed Ukraine&apos;s allies would not accept these conditions and that he expected Kyiv to continue receiving foreign weapons. &quot;I think that partners, serious partners, will not go for it ... This is not a game that is dictated exclusively by Putin,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;And I think that the aid will continue. We have the aid of the United States of America, we have the aid of our European colleagues. We are in constant contact. I am sure that there will be no betrayal from our partners.&quot; Zelensky reiterated Ukraine&apos;s longstanding support for peace and its desire to end attacks against energy infrastructure, seaports, and food corridors. &quot;We will support any proposals that lead to a fair peace,&quot; he said. The president also confirmed that Ukraine and Russia will each exchange 175 prisoners on March 19. Zelensky spoke to reporters virtually, as he and First Lady Olena Zelenska are currently in Helsinki, Finland for an official visit.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-supports-energy-sector-ceasefire-expects-military-aid-to-continue-zelensky-says/	2025-03-18T15:30:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/ze1.png
Trump, Putin open to 'mutually beneficial cooperation' in key sectors, Kremlin says	U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are developing &quot;mutually beneficial cooperation&quot; in a number of areas as part of efforts to normalize relations between the two countries, the Kremlin said in a readout of the leaders&apos; phone call on March 18. Earlier in the day, Trump and Putin spoke via phone for an hour and a half, discussing options for a ceasefire in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine and U.S.-Russian relations. Trump and Putin share a &quot;mutual interest&quot; in normalizing relations between Washington and Moscow due to &quot;the special responsibility of Russia and the United States for ensuring security and stability in the world,&quot; the Kremlin&apos;s statement reads. &quot;In this context, a wide range of areas in which our countries could establish interaction was considered. A number of ideas were discussed that are moving towards the development of mutually beneficial cooperation in the economy and energy sector.&quot; During the call, Putin agreed to pause Russia&apos;s attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure facilities for 30 days &#x2014; a significantly narrower proposal than Washington&apos;s initial plan for a total 30-day ceasefire between Kyiv and Moscow. Russia and the U.S. also during the call agreed to immediately begin another round of peace negotiations in the Middle East, focusing on the energy sector pause as well as technical negotiations for implementing a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea. The conversation was not solely focused on Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The leaders discussed improving bilateral relations, and the potential for what the White House later described as &quot;enormous economic deals.&quot; The Kremlin also claimed that Trump supported Putin&apos;s idea to organize hockey matches between professional Russian and American players. President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had not yet discussed the conversation with Trump, but that Kyiv supports a halt on energy infrastructure attacks. He also that Putin&apos;s rejection of a full ceasefire reflects Russia&apos;s desire to continue its offensives in multiple regions of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-putin-open-to-mutually-beneficial-cooperation-in-key-sectors-kremlin-says/	2025-03-18T14:25:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-810261630.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Putin, Trump hold 1.5-hour call, discuss ceasefire in Ukraine	Key developments on March 18: Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to a 30-day pause of energy infrastructure strikes during a call with U.S. President Donald Trump, according to a readout of the call issued by the Kremlin on March 18. &quot;During the conversation, Donald Trump proposed a mutual refusal of the parties to the conflict to strike for 30 days on energy infrastructure facilities,&quot; the statement said. &quot;Vladimir Putin responded positively to this initiative and immediately gave the appropriate command to the Russian military.&quot; Russia has been bombing Ukraine&apos;s civilian energy infrastructure since 2022 and has been steadily expanding its air campaigns in recent months, with bombardments by swarms of Shahed drones a nightly occurrence. Ukraine has recently had some success in counterattacks. On the night of March 10, over 330 Ukrainian drones targeted Moscow. Subsequent strikes have hit Russia&apos;s fossil fuel infrastructure. The Kremlin also said Putin &quot;responded constructively to Donald Trump&apos;s idea of &#x200B;&#x200B;implementing a well-known initiative concerning the safety of navigation in the Black Sea.&quot; &quot;It was agreed to begin negotiations to further elaborate specific details of such an agreement,&quot; the statement added. The statement followed a 1.5-hours phone call between Putin and Trump, during which they discussed ending the war in Ukraine and the U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire to allow for further peace talks. The Kremlin also demanded a complete cessation of foreign military aid and intelligence to Ukraine as a &quot;key condition for avoiding an escalation of the war.&quot; In addition to halting foreign military aid and intelligence, Russia also called for Ukraine to cease the mobilization and rearmament of its military. Washington announced on March 18 that another round of talks on the Russian war in Ukraine would &quot;begin immediately&quot; in the Middle East. The announcement follows a call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which they discussed a 30-day ceasefire proposal and steps to end the war. &quot;This conflict should never have started and should have been ended long ago with sincere and good faith peace efforts,&quot; the White House&apos;s statement read. Putin and Trump agreed that the war needs to end with &quot;a lasting peace,&quot; and the first steps towards this will be an energy and infrastructure ceasefire and technical negotiations on implementing a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea. The negotiations on these matters will &quot;begin immediately&quot; in the Middle East, according to the statement. Putin and Trump also agreed that there is a need for improved bilateral relations between the U.S. and Russia, saying this cooperation has &quot;a huge upside,&quot; including &quot;enormous economic deals and geopolitical stability when peace has been achieved.&quot; Trump called the conversation with Putin &quot;a very good and productive&quot; one. &quot;Many elements of a contract for peace were discussed, including the fact that thousands of soldiers are being killed, and both President Putin and President Zelensky would like to see it end,&quot; the U.S. president wrote on Truth Social. &quot;That process is now in full force and effect, and we will, hopefully, for the sake of humanity, get the job done!&quot; he added. Trump also supported an idea proposed by Putin to organize US-Russia hockey matches. &quot;Donald Trump supported Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s idea to organize hockey matches in the USA and Russia between Russian and American players playing in the NHL and KHL,&quot; the Kremlin said in a readout. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on March 18 that the Ukrainian Armed Forces attempted to enter Russia&apos;s Belgorod Oblast but were repelled by the Russian military. The news of an alleged Ukrainian offensive in Belgorod Oblast surfaced in Russian media just ahead of the phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump. Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation, denied the claims. Ukraine allegedly launched an offensive on Belgorod Oblast to &quot;discredit Trump&apos;s peace initiatives,&quot; the Russian Defense Ministry claimed. According to the ministry, Ukraine carried out five assaults toward the settlements of Demidovka and Prilesye. &quot;All attacks were repulsed by the actions of the state border protection units of the &apos;North&apos; forces group, artillery fire and the use of FPV (first-person-view) drones. No crossing of the state border of the Russian Federation was allowed,&quot; the ministry&apos;s statement read. Ukrainian authorities did not comment on the statement of the Russian Defense Ministry. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Belgorod Oblast borders Ukraine&apos;s Sumy, Kharkiv, and Luhansk oblasts and is regularly used by Russia to launch strikes against Ukrainian territory. Belgorod Oblast authorities have repeatedly accused Ukraine of launching attacks against the region and Belgorod proper throughout the full-scale war. Recently, multiple clashes have been reported in the region amid Ukraine&apos;s ongoing cross-border incursion focused on neighboring Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from one front-line sector in Donetsk Oblast to preserve troops and improve defensive operations, Lieutenant General Serhii Naiev, the commander of a tactical group in the region, reported on March 18. &quot;This allowed us not only to save our soldiers but also to improve our defense. (Russia) is suffering losses, and we can act more effectively,&quot; Naiev wrote on Facebook. It remains unclear which section of the front line the commander was referring to. Naiev, the former commander of Ukraine&apos;s Joint Forces, noted that his leadership of the tactical group in Donetsk Oblast has now entered its second month. The general emphasized that over the past month, coordinated efforts by scouts, drone operators, artillery, mortar units, tanks, and infantry have destroyed more than 30 Russian armored vehicles and taken out 2,000 Russian soldiers. &#x201C;This has significantly reduced the number of Russian attacks in our direction,&#x201D; he said. According to Interfax Ukraine&apos;s undisclosed source, Naiev has been appointed to command the Velyka Novosilka tactical group. The occupied village of Velyka Novosilka lies some 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of the administrative border between the Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk oblasts. The withdrawal was carried out in February and concerned Ukrainian units in the area of the villages Dachne, Zelenivka, and Andriivka north of Velyka Novosilka, Ukrainska Pravda&apos;s undisclosed sources claimed. Kyiv&apos;s forces stationed there pulled back to avoid encirclement in the so-called Kurakhove pocket, according to the outlet. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. A Ukrainian military spokesperson has declined to comment. The Ukrainian military reported that Russia has stepped up attacks in the southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast over the past few weeks but denied Russian claims of capturing the village of Stepove. Throughout the fall of 2024, Russian forces made operational gains in Donetsk Oblast, including areas near Toretsk and Chasiv Yar. Fighting remains intense in the eastern region, and Russian troops continue to advance, albeit slowly, this year. The Kremlin wants all Western arms supplies to Ukraine to stop during a proposed truce but prioritizes a pause on U.S. arms as its &quot;minimum aim,&quot; Bloomberg reported on March 18, citing two undisclosed sources in Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on March 13 that Moscow is open to a 30-day ceasefire, agreed upon by the U.S. and Ukraine, but only if Kyiv stops receiving foreign arms and conscripting and training its forces. These conditions have raised concerns that Ukraine would be left vulnerable to renewed Russian offensives as no such limitations are being proposed in regard to Russia&apos;s Armed Forces. Bloomberg&apos;s sources confirmed that the halt on Western arms supplies &#x2014; or at the very least, U.S. assistance &#x2014; remains as Putin&apos;s condition. Putin is scheduled to call with U.S. President Donald Trump later on March 18 between 4 and 6 p.m. Moscow time, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed. The two leaders are expected to discuss the proposed ceasefire plan. The U.S. temporarily halted military supplies for Ukraine earlier this month before restarting it after Kyiv agreed to the truce plan during talks in Jeddah on March 11. The ongoing supplies are covered by the presidential drawdown authority (PDA) packages approved by former President Joe Biden, who made the U.S. into Ukraine&apos;s leading military donor. Trump has not approved any new packages and has made it clear he does not seek a prolonged U.S. engagement in Ukraine. The EU reportedly has no intention of halting military aid to Ukraine during the proposed truce. European countries are seeking ways to bolster support for Kyiv as continued backing from the U.S. grows increasingly uncertain.

Zelensky confirms prisoner exchange, says he has not yet spoken with Trump after Putin call	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky has not spoken with U.S. President Donald Trump since his White House phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier on March 18, the Ukrainian news outlet Suspilne reported. Trump and Putin held a 1.5-hour phone call earlier in the day, during which Putin agreed to a 30-day pause on energy infrastructure attacks while rejecting Washington&apos;s proposal for a complete cessation of hostilities. Zelensky told reporters on March 18 that he had not yet spoken with Trump about his conversation with Putin, but that he expected to discuss the matter in detail soon. He also said Kyiv supports a halt on energy infrastructure attacks in principle. &quot;I expect that we will have a conversation with President Trump, we will understand the details,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;We have always supported the position of not attacking the energy sector with any weapons.&quot; During the conversation with Trump, Putin said that on March 19, Ukraine and Russia would each exchange 175 prisoners. He also said Moscow pledged to return more than 23 seriously wounded Ukrainian soldiers. Zelensky confirmed that a prisoner swap would take place on March 19, saying it was a pre-planned exchange. Zelensky also said that Putin&apos;s rejection of Washington&apos;s 30-day ceasefire plan signaled the Kremlin&apos;s desire to &quot;issue ultimatums&quot; rather than negotiate peace in good faith. &quot;I would really like President Trump to hear and see what Putin wants,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Putin wants to make several offensives in the Zaporizhzhia direction, in the east, in the Kharkiv and Sumy directions. Why? In order to put maximum pressure on Ukraine and then issue ultimatums from a position of strength.&quot; Following Putin&apos;s talk with Trump, the Kremlin issued a statement demanding a complete halt on all foreign military aid and intelligence to Ukraine, calling it a &quot;key condition for avoiding an escalation of the war.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-confirms-prisoner-exchange-says-he-has-not-yet-spoken-with-trump-after-putin-call/	2025-03-18T13:22:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1843522320.jpg

Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 18	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 18 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from March 10&#x2013;16, 2025. The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Commission eliminates 17 candidates in first round of Economic Security Bureau leadership race On March 14, the competition commission held the first stage of the selection process for the new director of the Bureau of Economic Security (BES) &#x2013; a general skills exam. Following the assessment, 17 candidates were eliminated, including the current acting BES chief, Serhii Perkhun. Only 16 candidates scored 107 points or higher and will advance to the next stage &#x2014; a legal knowledge exam. Parliament approves civil service pay reform, rejects several salaries increases Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, the Verkhovna Rada has passed draft law #8222, introducing a standardized pay structure for civil servants based on a position classification system. The reform, aimed at aligning public sector salaries with Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development standards, was supported by 259 MPs. The reform is a requirement under the Ukraine Facility financial mechanism, with a Q1 2025 deadline. However, amendments to raise salaries for several key ministries were partially rejected. Salary increases for the State Audit Service (DASU) were approved while proposed raises for the Justice Ministry, Finance Ministry, Digital Transformation Ministry, Economy Ministry and the Verkhovna Rada Secretariat were voted down. While the newly adopted civil service pay reform introduces a standardized classification system, it does not immediately address the broader issue of the public sector&apos;s lack of competitiveness in the job market. As Ugis Sics, head of EU4PAR project, noted: &#x201C;The position classification system needs to be expanded to cover all civil service roles, while fairness, transparency, and competitiveness in civil servants&apos; salaries must continue to improve in an increasingly competitive labor market.&quot; Zelensky signs law to purchase outdated Russian nuclear reactors for $1 billion Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has signed bill #11392, approving the $1 billion purchase of two outdated Russian nuclear reactors from Bulgaria. The reactors, originally manufactured by Rosatom for Bulgaria&#x2019;s unfinished Belene Nuclear Power Plant, are set to be used for the construction of reactor units No. 3 and No. 4 at Ukraine&#x2019;s Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant (KhNPP). However, Energoatom still hasn&#x2019;t received an approval from the Verkhovna Rada to launch the construction of these reactors. Ukrainian TV channel linked to Presidential Office receives around $4.4 million in state contracts at premium rates On March 13, Ukraine held a state procurement auction to allocate over Hr 700 million ($16.7 million) for content production for the United News Marathon in 2025. Major broadcasters Inter, StarLight Media, 1+1, and We &#x2014; Ukraine each secured Hr 184 million ($4.4 million) in contracts. However, We &#x2014; Ukraine received the highest per-hour rate at Hr 163,000 ($3,900) per hour &#x2014; a rate exceeding that of other networks. The channel has previously received the largest state contracts for producing United News content in 2023 and 2024. The Presidential Office&apos;s alleged connection to We &#x2013; Ukraine has been repeatedly discussed in the public sphere. Evidence supporting these claims can be found in reports by Detector media, Ukraiinska Pravda, and MP Iaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s YouTube channel.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-18/	2025-03-18T12:17:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1643784975.jpg

The call follows U.S.-led negotiations in Saudi Arabia, where Washington proposed a 30-day ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. The call between the presidents began at 10 a.m. EDT and lasted &quot;over an hour and a half,&quot; according to NBC. Putin-Trump call went &quot;very well,&quot; CNN reported, citing an unnamed Russian source with knowledge of the call. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino also said earlier the call was &quot;going well.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-trump-end-talks-after-2-5-hour-call/	2025-03-18T09:47:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-810261630.jpg
Meet the Ukrainian fashion brand that's making heritage trendy	Editor&#x2019;s note: This article is part of a series of profiles highlighting successful Ukrainian startups and businesses. The series is funded by the regional investment fund Ukraine-Moldova American Enterprise Fund (UMAEF) and created in partnership with Spend With Ukraine, a non-profit organization that launched a platform to showcase businesses with Ukrainian roots and provide one more meaningful way to support Ukraine &#x2013; by choosing to spend with Ukraine. The series&#x2019; sponsors are not involved in the editorial process of the writing of these profiles. &#x201C;Gunia wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be a brand about Ukraine,&#x201D; says co-founder Maria Gavryliuk in the company&#x2019;s downtown Kyiv office as she begins to recount the brand&#x2019;s origin story. In 2017, Gavryliuk&#x2019;s co-founder Natalia Kamenska had grown tired of a fashion industry she felt was too focused on mass production and commercial interests, rather than creativity. Kamenska sold her part of the company where both she and Gavryliuk worked &#x2014; the Ukrainian fashion brand Kamenskakononova &#x2014; and began traveling around Ukraine for inspiration. While in the Carpathian mountains, Kamenska encountered a &#x201C;gunia,&#x201D; a traditional western Ukrainian shag fur coat that weighs around six kilos (13 pounds). Her discoveries in the mountains were just the entry point into the vast world of Ukrainian folk traditions, and not just for Kamenska. Traditional Hutsul outerwear &#x201C;gunia,&#x201D; a shag fur coat from western Ukraine that weighs around six kilos (13 pounds). (Carpathian Lens)&#x201C;She opened up this new world for herself and came to realize that nobody from our creative sphere knew anything about these traditions,&#x201D; Gavryliuk says. For many years, Ukraine&#x2019;s cultural heritage was largely inaccessible to Ukrainians themselves, the result of centuries of Russian influence and domination over the country. This began to change with the EuroMaidan Revolution in 2014 when Ukraine as a whole, including its creative industries, began to look inward and westward and away from Russia. The trend has only gained momentum since the start of the full-scale invasion. Despite the societal shifts, deeply entrenched stereotypes around Ukrainian-made products &#x2014; that they were cheap or uninteresting &#x2014; still persisted in some circles even when Kamenska and Gavryliuk started Gunia in 2017 &#x2014; first, more as a hobby creating silk scarves with Ukrainian folk-inspired designs. Maria Gavriliuk (L) and Natalia Kamenska (R) - founders of Gunia. (Gunia)&#x201C;It was our idea to break this (perception) and showcase that you can make something cool and trendy with Ukrainian ethnic motifs.&#x201D; Gunia, which officially launched as a company in 2019, is far from the only brand to pop up in the last several years that is taking its inspiration from Ukraine&#x2019;s cultural history. But what sets it apart is its approach &#x2014; taking Ukrainian historical artifacts, not to simply replicate them in a modern style, but to create entirely new ornamentation on its ceramics, clothing, and jewelry that appeal to both Ukrainians and foreign audiences. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s important for us to create new objects, not to keep things the way they were made years before, but to take something as inspiration and then create something new. So we mix and match, we use different colors,&#x201D; Gavryliuk says. &#x2003; Zoya Zvyniatskovskaia, a Ukrainian fashion historian, characterizes Gunia&#x2019;s approach not as an attempt to exclusively popularize the motifs of traditional Ukrainian clothing, textiles, or ceramics but rather as a search for appealing designs in the work of Ukrainian urban na&#xEF;ve art. Gunia&apos;s ceramics. (Gunia)Unlike traditional na&#xEF;ve art that is associated with rural or folk themes, urban na&#xEF;ve artwork incorporates elements of the city and popular culture. Urban na&#xEF;ve, as Zvyniatskovskaia puts it, includes &#x201C;personalized folk art, when the artists add something of their own rather than copying a traditional ornament like an amusing boy or crooked bird.&#x201D; One of Gunia&#x2019;s most recognizable ornaments, and part of its logo, resembles a cherub&#x2019;s head. While urban na&#xEF;ve art was less developed in Ukraine, for the European and Western consumer, the reference to the aesthetic &#x2014; think Pablo Picasso&#x2019;s primitive art &#x2014; resonates, says Zvyniatskovskaia. Indeed, with a relatively narrow domestic market, many Ukrainian companies have global ambitions. Gunia already sells its products in Switzerland, London, Poland, Berlin, Lisbon, Paris, and even Japan. That doesn&#x2019;t mean Gunia isn&#x2019;t popular at home. &#x201C;Gunia is in great demand among the customers at Kyiv&apos;s central department store TSUM&#x201D;, Kostiantyn Putylenko, marketing director of TSUM Kyiv, tells Kyiv Independent. Last year, Gunia and TSUM Kyiv collaborated on a holiday collection, which, according to the department store, was very successful. The Valentine&#x2019;s Day collection last year was inspired largely by mid-20th-century naive embroidered rushnyky &#x2014; traditional embroidered ritual cloths &#x2014; from a collection of Kyiv&#x2019;s Ivan Honchar museum of items made in the Poltava and Cherkasy regions. TSUM&#x2019;s private label department and Gunia also partnered to create a separate brand of gifts and home goods, TSUM by Gunia. The idea was create a line of gifts that would &#x201C;embody national motifs in a modern interpretation,&#x201D; and that &#x201C;the choice of Gunia was obvious,&#x201D; Kateryna Lopachak, director of private label at TSUM Kyiv tells the Kyiv Independent. Some of the items &#x201C;instantly sold out&quot; after the launch, according to Lopachak. But before any Gunia creations hit shelves anywhere, the team goes through a painstaking amount of work to go from idea to finished product, Gavryliuk says. Each seasonal collection &#x2014; which includes a line of hand-painted ceramic dishware, jewelry, and clothing &#x2014; is the result of months of travel, research, and a general quest for inspiration around Ukraine, its museums, and the world. Gavryliuk and Kamenska, along with a team of designers, develop the concept based on myths and folklore, patterns, and designs they see in both Ukrainian traditional wear as well as global fashion trends. The designs that emerge weave together folk, religious, and artistic motifs in modern compositions. Once the research is complete, a team of designers draws up its sketches, sending them off to various teams of artisans and craftspeople in workshops and ateliers around the country to get to work on bringing new objects to life. Collections include various modern interpretations of Ukrainian traditional ware, from sorochky, Ukrainian embroidered blouses, and fartukhy, traditional embroidered aprons in its clothing lines, to hlechyky, Ukrainian traditional jugs, in its ceramics department.

(Viacheslav Ratynskyi / The Kyiv Independent)In the company&#x2019;s clothing atelier in downtown Kyiv just across the street from its flagship store on Antonovycha Street, a team is currently working on the clothing line for Gunia&#x2019;s upcoming Easter collection, this year titled &#x201C;Naive.&#x201D; The series&#x2019; items are adorned with embroidered flowers, birds, angels, nature scenes, and rural motifs and takes its inspiration largely from Gunia&#x2019;s private collection of rushnyky made in the 1950s and 1960s. The Easter clothing drop will include a spring jacket, three women&#x2019;s shirts, and a men&#x2019;s shirt &#x2014; all in off-white with black embroidery, the minimalist color scheme Gunia tends to go for with the occasional splash of color. One piece of clothing in each line goes through 14 stages before it hits shelves &#x2014; traveling around the atelier from designers, to craftswomen, machine embroidery specialists, tailors, seamstresses, and quality control specialists, and briefly taken away for fitting. At the end of the process, the items are shown to a wordsmith who will come up with names for each item in the collection. Then it&#x2019;s off to production, distribution, and warehouse managers, who will make sure the clothing items get made and sold in stores and online both in Ukraine and abroad. The same goes for ceramics and jewelry. The most difficult stage in creating the clothing items is the embroidery, according to Iryna Fedorenko, head of Gunia&#x2019;s clothing atelier, who says it&#x2019;s a very technically complex process. &#xA0; &#x201C;One of the main problems we run into is the right choice of threads and fabric &#x2014; they have to &#x2018;befriend&#x2019; one another,&#x201D; Fedorenko says as she shows an embroidered shirt created in the studio that she says had to be redone six times before they got the combination of thread and fabric right. If the fabric is too thin, and the thread too thick, it can lead to tears and holes. Iryna Fedorenko, head of Gunia&#x2019;s clothing atelier, in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 28, 2025. (Viacheslav Ratynskyi/The Kyiv Independent)While a few clothing items are completely hand-embroidered, most of them are done on a machine. In one room of the atelier, the loud whir of an embroidery machine fills the space as Gunia employees carefully watch the machine transfer a programmed pattern onto a traditional large bell-shaped sleeve of a woman&#x2019;s embroidered shirt. Once this particular sleeve has spent four hours under the needles of the machine, the embroiderer will add the finishing touches by hand &#x2014; in this particular case, using the &#x201C;Richelieu&#x201D; technique, or cutwork embroidery that dates back to 16th century Italy and involves a delicate practice of cutting away fabric threads to create a lace-like effect. For this shirt in the collection, embroidered star-shaped flowers and swans float as if on water around a large bow whose Richelieu cutwork makes it look like ribbon. The dreamy fairytale design lends itself to the maiden-like qualities of these traditional cotton and linen shirts. Once the embroiderers have done their work, the shirt is sent to the room next door, where a seamstress will cut the sleeves to be sewn onto the body of the shirt. Then it&#x2019;s off to the tailors to make sure that no button, hem, no small detail is out of place &#x2014; and most of all, that the clothing item will be comfortable for the wearer. &#xA0; &#x201C;There is attention to detail in every seam,&#x201D; Fedorenko says in the tailor&#x2019;s workspace as she shows off the various test runs of the latest collection&#x2019;s pieces. &#x201C;We struggle, we suffer, we cry, but everything works out in the end.&#x201D; Gunia fuses Ukraine&#x2019;s rich cultural heritage with modern fashion, crafting pieces that pay tribute to the past while shaping the future.

France to deploy fighter jets with nuclear warheads on German border by 2035, Macron says	France will deploy Rafale fighter jets equipped with supersonic nuclear warheads along its border with Germany in 2035, French President Emmanuel Macron announced on March 18 at the Luxeuil-Saint-Sauveur Airbase, according to BFMTV. The move comes as the U.S. shifts its focus away from Europe and Ukraine, signaling that the continent may not be able to rely on Washington for its future security. By 2035, Luxeuil will be the first base to host the next-generation Rafale fighter jet and its hypersonic nuclear missile, a crucial part of the ongoing modernization of France&#x2019;s nuclear deterrent, Macron said. The Dassault Rafale, a fourth-generation French fighter jet developed by Dassault Aviation, has been in service with the French Air Force since 2000. Its naval variant, the Rafale M, serves as the primary combat aircraft for the French Navy. The Rafale can fly at supersonic speeds without an afterburner and take off from runways as short as 400 meters. The aircraft is powered by two engines. Two new Rafale squadrons &#x2014; nearly 40 aircraft &#x2014; will be stationed at the airbase near Luxeuil-les-Bains, which will receive 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) in modernization funding from the French government. By 2035, around 2,000 military and civilian personnel will be stationed at the base, according to Macron. The French president also confirmed that France would &#x201C;increase and accelerate orders for Rafales&#x201D; amid shifting geopolitical realities. Western leaders and defense officials previously warned about the threat emanating from Russia amid Europe&apos;s current lack of military preparedness. Western intelligence agencies have also warned that Russia may find the opportunity to launch a large-scale war on Europe within five years.	https://kyivindependent.com/france-to-deploy-fighter-jets-with-nuclear-warheads-on-german-border-by-2035-macron-says/	2025-03-18T08:49:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2205170809.jpg
Trump, Putin hold call, White House Deputy Chief of Staff says	U.S. President Donald Trump has been speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin since 10:00 a.m. EDT, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino said on X. The call follows U.S.-led negotiations in Saudi Arabia, where Washington proposed a 30-day ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. Kyiv accepted the deal during talks in Jeddah on March 11, prompting the U.S. to resume military and intelligence support for Ukraine. &quot;Happening now &#x2014; President Trump is currently in the Oval Office speaking with President Vladimir Putin of Russia since 10:00 a.m. EDT. The call is going well, and still in progress,&quot; he said on X. On March 13, Putin said Russia was willing to accept the ceasefire but demanded guarantees that Ukraine would not mobilize troops, conduct training, or receive military assistance during the truce, making it potentially vulnerable to renewed Russian aggression. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he was &quot;very much&quot; looking forward to the call with Putin, adding that &quot;many elements of a Final Agreement have been agreed to, but much remains.&quot; &quot;Thousands of young soldiers, and others, are being killed. Each week brings 2,500 soldier death and it must end NOW,&quot; Trump wrote on March 17. Trump earlier said discussions would include territorial matters and power plants. To discuss the proposal, U.S. Special Representative Steve Witkoff traveled to Moscow this week, where Putin reportedly signaled openness to the U.S. plan.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-trump-holding-phone-call/	2025-03-18T08:17:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-872780694.jpg
Polish right takes hard line on Ukraine ahead of presidential vote	With the Polish presidential elections just two months away, two of the country&apos;s leading right-wing candidates have become increasingly antagonistic toward Ukraine and its leadership. Kyiv can ill afford another hostile head of state among its key partners, as U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s foreign policy shift has already thrown the pro-Ukraine coalition into disarray. Rafal Trzaskowski, 53, a progressive mayor of Warsaw backed by the key ruling party, Prime Minister Donald Tusk&apos;s Civic Platform, remains a clear favorite, polling at around 35%. He faces two opponents from the right, both of whom stand a chance to advance to the runoff scheduled for June 1. The conservative Law and Justice party (PiS), which led the government from 2015 to 2023 and has an ally in incumbent President Andrzej Duda, has tapped relatively unknown historian Karol Nawrocki as its candidate in the upcoming elections. Polling at 24%, Nawrocki is only about five percentage points ahead of Slawomir Mentzen, one of the leaders of the far-right Confederation coalition. Both men have made headlines by public spats with Ukrainian officials and denounced Kyiv as ungrateful for the support Warsaw has provided. Their popularity potentially signals a growing acceptance of anti-Ukraine sentiments in Poland as Russia&apos;s full-scale war entered its fourth year. The unresolved historical grievances and constant economic disputes between Kyiv and Warsaw have forced even pro-Ukrainian politicians to tread carefully when it comes to dealings with Ukraine. Liberal Trzaskowski has made it clear that &quot;military support for Ukraine is in Poland&apos;s national interest&quot; as &quot;Ukrainians are fighting for our (Poland&apos;s) freedom.&quot; &quot;But we need a sincere conversation about how we see the future of our relations, a sincere conversation about how Ukrainians should take our sensitivity to historical issues seriously, a sincere conversation about how negotiations on Ukraine&apos;s membership in the EU will be very difficult and, unfortunately, will last for many years,&quot; he then added. Nawrocki, 42, is a historian who heads the Institute of National Remembrance, a state agency that studies the crimes committed during World War II and Poland&apos;s communist era. This professional background seems to have shaped his political views, which are marked by clear anti-communism and distaste for Russian expansionism. The conservative politician, who is on Russia&apos;s wanted list over the demolition of Soviet memorials in Poland, recently suggested cutting diplomatic ties with Moscow, as &quot;maintaining diplomatic ties with a barbaric state is not good for Poland.&quot; But that doesn&apos;t mean the historian-turned-politician is pro-Ukraine. While pledging that Polish support for Kyiv will continue if he is elected, Nawrocki signaled he wants to see more gratitude for the assistance provided to both Ukrainian front-line soldiers and refugees. Nawrocki also declared that Ukraine would not be able to enter NATO or the EU without resolving the issue of the Volyn massacres &#x2014; a sentiment shared by many Polish politicians across the aisle.

(Jakub Porzycki / NurPhoto / Getty Images)&quot;Today, I do not see Ukraine in either structure, neither in the European Union nor in NATO, until those important civilizational issues are resolved,&quot; Nawrocki said in January in reference to the World War II-era massacre of Poles by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army in the present-day Volyn Oblast of Ukraine. The Volyn massacres, which saw tens of thousands of Poles living in Nazi-occupied Volyn killed and thousands of Ukrainians killed in reprisal attacks in 1943-1944, remain the most contentious topic in Polish-Ukrainian relations. When Tusk hailed a joint breakthrough in efforts to exhume Polish victims in modern-day Ukraine, Nawrocki dismissed the announcement as an &quot;unnecessary trick.&quot; Some of Nawrocki&apos;s sharpest comments were aimed personally at President Volodymyr Zelensky. When nearly all European politicians &#x2014; including Tusk &#x2014; rushed to support Zelensky after his heated Oval Office exchange with Trump, Nawrocki, as well as the rest of PiS, backed the U.S. president instead. Nawrocki even said that the subsequent pause on U.S. military support was the &quot;result of President Zelensky&apos;s lack of gratitude and lack of ability to conduct international policy.&quot; This bellicose rhetoric may seem at odds with PiS, whose past government led the charge in providing Ukraine with arms and other support during the full-scale war. But as the elections are coming near and the Ukraine fatigue is setting in, the conservative party may be shifting gears.

(Maxym Marusenko/NurPhoto via Getty Images)&quot;I suspect these are his (Nawrocki&apos;s) original views that were muted at the beginning because of the party policy, but now, because they are fighting for the same part of the electorate (as the far-right), he was &apos;let loose,&apos;&quot; Polish political scientist Pawel Borkowski told the Kyiv Independent. Nawrocki&apos;s main opponent for second place, and thus a potential contender to face Trzaskowski in the runoff, is far-right Mentzen. His Confederation and PiS are likely to battle over rural voters and agrarian workers in the upcoming vote. Farmers, who fear competition from their Ukrainian counterparts, represent a vocal part of the electorate, as their numerous protests and border blockades have demonstrated. &quot;Unfortunately, Ukraine has been playing the role of a &apos;scapegoat&apos; for Polish politicians for quite some time now, a trend that began during the 2023 parliamentary campaign,&quot; Yevhen Mahda, executive director of the Institute of World Policy in Kyiv, told the Kyiv Independent. Surveys reveal that the Polish public has grown more skeptical toward Ukraine and, specifically, Ukrainian refugees when compared to 2022. According to a February poll commissioned by the Mieroszewski Center, 49% of Poles favored continued military support for Ukraine, yet only 40% supported assistance for refugees. &quot;The motive that Ukraine is not grateful enough is very present&quot; in Polish society, said Aleksandra Kusztal, a political scientist at the Jan Kochanowski University of Kielce, in comments for the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Some elements (which) are typical for the Russian propaganda, Russian disinformation, are becoming more and more popular,&quot; such as the supposed negative impact of Ukrainians on Poland&apos;s social and healthcare system, she added. A devout libertarian who voiced support for Polish exit from the EU, 38-year-old entrepreneur and tax advisor Mentzen has become one of Poland&apos;s most popular far-right politicians. His apt use of the TikTok social network and public campaigning make it conceivable that he, not Nawrocki, will face Trzaskowski in the second round. The Confederation, co-chaired by Mentzen, has long been seen as the only relevant force in Polish politics that could be described as openly hostile toward Ukraine. During the parliamentary elections in 2023, during which the far-right significantly underperformed, Confederation said that Ukraine should pay for all assistance provided by Poland &#x2014; an argument eerily echoing those coming from today&apos;s Washington. However, emulating far-right populists across Europe, the Confederation has sought to purge its most controversial elements. Two of the most overtly pro-Russian figures, Janusz Korwin-Mikke and antisemite Grzegorz Braun, have been suspended or expelled from the coalition. Slawomir Mentzen, co-leader of the Confederation alliance, tosses fake money to supporters during a campaign rally in Szczecin, Poland, on Sept. 16, 2023. (Sean Gallup / Getty Images)Mentzen himself has formally denounced Russian aggression and has largely shaped his Ukraine rhetoric along more transactional lines. &quot;Yes, it is profitable for us for Ukraine to defend itself against Russia, which is why Poles help Ukraine,&quot; Mentzen told Polsat. &quot;Not out of sympathy, but because it is simply profitable for us.&quot; &quot;We send weapons to Ukraine, we send money, we send social benefits, we provide medical treatment for free in Poland to Ukrainians who do not even have medical insurance, while Poles have to pay, and in return we receive slander, they insult us and show absolutely no gratitude.&quot; He also said that the West must reach some kind of an agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as &quot;there is no force on the horizon that will drive Putin out of Ukraine.&quot; In some cases, Mentzen does not hesitate to push further. One episode that caught the attention of both Polish and Ukrainian media was his public spat with Lviv Mayor Andrii Sadovyi. After visiting the western Ukrainian city on Feb. 24, Mentzen published a video near the monument to Stepan Bandera, calling the late Ukrainian nationalist a &quot;terrorist&quot; and accused Ukraine of &quot;worshipping criminals.&quot; Bandera, assassinated by the KGB in 1959, led the radical wing of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and organized the assassination of Polish Interior Minister Bronislaw Pieracki. Sadovyi lashed out against Mentzen, calling him a &quot;pro-Russian politician with a Polish passport.&quot; Mentzen then named Lviv, which was part of Poland in the interwar period, a &quot;culturally Polish city,&quot; a statement with explosive connotations during the ongoing Russian occupation of one-fifth of Ukraine. Experts largely agree that this was a public stunt rather than a serious attempt at territorial revisionism, a topic with almost non-existent appeal in Polish politics. &quot;It was a pure provocation,&quot; Kusztal commented, calling Mentzen&apos;s campaign nevertheless &quot;very strongly connected with Russian propaganda.&quot; Kusztal presented Mentzen&apos;s anti-Ukraine rhetoric as &quot;something quite new in his political biography.&quot; The expert suggested it could be a tactic to steal voters from Braun, who announced his own candidacy. According to Borkowski, Mentzen wanted to strengthen his appeal across the various right-wing groups that make up the Confederation. &quot;Slawomir Mentzen&apos;s conflict with Andrii Sadovyi was staged and election-driven,&quot; Mahda concurred. &quot;However, this does not negate the fact that historical policy plays a much greater role in public discourse in Poland than it does in Ukraine.&quot; Hi, this is Martin Fornusek.

Russian negotiator says he expects talks with Musk on space, tech	Kirill Dmitriev, the CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), said he expects Russia to hold talks with U.S. billionaire and President Donald Trump&apos;s ally, Elon Musk, in the near future, the pro-state news agency RBK reported on March 18. The comments come amid warming ties between the U.S. and Russia as the Trump administration signaled intent to renew bilateral relations and boost economic cooperation. Dmitriev, one of Russia&apos;s negotiators during talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia, said that the possible meeting with Musk would concern technological development and the &quot;future of humanity.&quot; &quot;I think that there will undoubtedly be a discussion with Musk (about Mars flights) in the near future,&quot; the Russian official said at a business forum, according to Reuters. Musk is the founder and CEO of the SpaceX space technology company. The billionaire recently announced plans to have his Starship spacecraft depart for Mars by the end of 2026. According to Dmitriev, Russia also seeks cooperation with Musk and SpaceX to help develop Russia&apos;s space agency Roscosmos and state-run nuclear energy company Rosatom. Musk has yet to comment on the potential meeting. Dmitriev&apos;s comments come as Trump is set to call Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss a proposed ceasefire in Ukraine, seen as a step toward a broader peace agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-expects-talks-with-musk/	2025-03-18T06:10:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202932520.jpg
Notorious judge dismissed amid accusations of criminal activity, power grab	The High Council of Justice has dismissed Judge Pavlo Vovk, the head of the liquidated Kyiv District Administrative Court (OASK), who has been charged with creating a criminal organization and attempting to seize power, according to an official announcement published on March 18. Vovk was held responsible for &quot;committing a significant disciplinary offense, gross or systematic neglect of duties that is incompatible with the status of a judge or revealed his incompatibility with the position he holds.&quot; The Anti-Corruption Action Center reported that Vovk failed to appear before the High Council of Justice and instead submitted multiple appeals, including requests for the recusal of council members and postponement of the proceedings. The speaker at the meeting, High Council of Justice member Oksana Kvasha, proposed dismissing Vovk. All 14 council members supported the proposal. Vovk has become a symbol of systemic corruption and judicial impunity in Ukraine. He and other judges from his court face charges of usurpation of power, obstruction of justice, organized crime, and abuse of authority. In December 2022, Ukraine&apos;s parliament voted to dissolve the Kyiv District Administrative Court, which had been mired in corruption scandals under Vovk&apos;s leadership. President Volodymyr Zelensky signed the decree, making it law. On Dec. 9, 2022, the U.S. Department of State sanctioned Vovk to mark International Anti-Corruption Day, imposing visa restrictions and potentially freezing his assets. Ukraine&apos;s High Anti-Corruption Court is hearing the criminal case against Vovk and his accomplices. For years, prosecutors, investigators, and courts have obstructed and delayed cases against him.	https://kyivindependent.com/notorious-ukrainian-judge-dismissed-amid-accusations-of-criminal-organization-power-grab/	2025-03-18T05:28:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/25299831_147735009333709_387239191894146183.jpg
UK reportedly hopes US drones, satellites will help monitor Ukraine ceasefire	The U.K. hopes that the U.S. will provide drones and satellite surveillance to monitor the border zone between Ukraine and Russia if a ceasefire agreement is reached, the Times reported on March 18, citing unnamed British diplomats. The U.S. military has 247 military satellites and thousands of commercial satellites, providing an &quot;unrivaled picture&quot; of eastern Ukraine that European forces would struggle to replicate, the Times wrote. Satellites with high-resolution imaging and thermal sensors could track troop movements, detect artillery fire, and monitor border areas for ceasefire violations. According to the Times, U.S. drones and satellites could enforce a possible buffer zone on either side of the front line to prevent hostilities from resuming. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has previously appealed to U.S. President Donald Trump to provide a &quot;backstop&quot; to a European-led plan to deploy at least 10,000 peacekeepers to Ukraine. Washington has so far refused to make any clear commitments to Ukraine&apos;s security, instead urging Europe to take responsibility for Kyiv&apos;s post-war stability. Starmer will host military leaders of the &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; in London on March 20 to discuss the peacekeeping mission. The discussions follow U.S.-led negotiations in Saudi Arabia, where Washington proposed a 30-day ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. Kyiv accepted the deal during bilateral talks in Jeddah on March 11, prompting the U.S. to resume military and intelligence support for Ukraine. On March 13, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow was also open to a ceasefire but demanded guarantees that Ukraine would halt mobilization, military training, and foreign aid deliveries during the truce. Such conditions could leave Kyiv vulnerable to future Russian offensives. Trump is set to hold a phone call with Putin on March 18 to discuss the proposed truce.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-expects-us-drones-satellite-surveillance-for-ukraine-ceasefire-monitoring-times-reports/	2025-03-18T05:10:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2202329109.jpg
Russia sees US aid halt during Ukraine truce as its 'minimum' goal, Bloomberg reports	The Kremlin wants all Western arms supplies to Ukraine to stop during a proposed truce but prioritizes a pause on U.S. arms as its &quot;minimum aim,&quot; Bloomberg reported on March 18, citing two undisclosed sources in Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on March 13 that Moscow is open to a 30-day ceasefire, agreed upon by the U.S. and Ukraine, but only if Kyiv stops receiving foreign arms and conscripting and training its forces. These conditions have raised concerns that Ukraine would be left vulnerable to renewed Russian offensives as no such limitations are being proposed in regard to Russia&apos;s Armed Forces. Bloomberg&apos;s sources confirmed that the halt on Western arms supplies &#x2014; or at the very least, U.S. assistance &#x2014; remains as Putin&apos;s condition. Putin is scheduled to call with U.S. President Donald Trump later on March 18 between 4 and 6 p.m. Moscow time, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed. The two leaders are expected to discuss the proposed ceasefire plan. The U.S. temporarily halted military supplies for Ukraine earlier this month before restarting it after Kyiv agreed to the truce plan during talks in Jeddah on March 11. The ongoing supplies are covered by the presidential drawdown authority (PDA) packages approved by former President Joe Biden, who made the U.S. into Ukraine&apos;s leading military donor. Trump has not approved any new packages and has made it clear he does not seek a prolonged U.S. engagement in Ukraine. The EU reportedly has no intention of halting military aid to Ukraine during the proposed truce. European countries are seeking ways to bolster support for Kyiv as continued backing from the U.S. grows increasingly uncertain.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-sees-us-aid-halt-during-ukraine-truce-as-minimum-goal-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-18T04:45:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1066818340.jpg
EU approves over $2 billion in economic support for Moldova	The Council of the EU gave its final approval to 1.9 billion euros (over $2 billion) in support for Moldova&apos;s EU-related reforms and economic growth, the council&apos;s press service announced on March 18. The Reform and Growth Facility, which includes 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) in low-interest loans and 385 million euros ($420 million) in grants, will cover the period of 2025-2027 and is part of the EU&apos;s long-term Moldova Growth Plan. Brussels has ramped up support for Moldova over the past few years to help alleviate the regional impacts of Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine and help Chisinau on its path to membership. Moldova launched accession talks with the EU last June. &quot;Today we are helping Moldovans advance key socio-economic reforms, boost their economy and accelerate the country&#x2019;s accession to the EU,&quot; said Adam Szlapka, Poland&apos;s Europan affairs minister, in a statement. &quot;The new instrument will also strengthen Moldova&#x2019;s resilience by mitigating the impact of Russia&#x2019;s unjust war of aggression against Ukraine.&quot; The newly approved tool marks the single largest support package provided to Moldova by the European bloc. The facility will now be signed by the presidents of the European Parliament and the Council of the EU and enter into force a day after being published in the EU Official Journal. Ukraine&apos;s neighbor Moldova has received Ukrainian refugees and repeatedly warned about Russia&apos;s attempts to destabilize the country, primarily through the Russian-occupied Moldovan region of Transnistria. Transnistria has faced a major energy crisis after the halt of Russian gas supplies at the start of the year. While Moldova has pivoted to European gas supplies prior to the transit halt, it has also faced difficulties as it receives electricity from a gas-powered energy plant located in Transnistria. Last month, the EU allocated 250 million euros ($273 million) to boost Moldova&apos;s energy independence and resilience.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-approves-2-billion-in-economic-support-for-moldova/	2025-03-18T04:13:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1738459748.jpeg
Ukraine withdraws from one front-line sector in Donetsk Oblast, commander says	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from one front-line sector in Donetsk Oblast to preserve troops and improve defensive operations, Lieutenant General Serhii Naiev, the commander of a tactical group in the region, reported on March 18. &quot;This allowed us not only to save our soldiers but also to improve our defense. (Russia) is suffering losses, and we can act more effectively,&quot; Naiev wrote on Facebook. It remains unclear which section of the front line the commander was referring to. Naiev, the former commander of Ukraine&apos;s Joint Forces, noted that his leadership of the tactical group in Donetsk Oblast has now entered its second month. The general emphasized that over the past month, coordinated efforts by scouts, drone operators, artillery, mortar units, tanks, and infantry have destroyed more than 30 Russian armored vehicles and taken out 2,000 Russian soldiers. &#x201C;This has significantly reduced the number of Russian attacks in our direction,&#x201D; he said. According to Interfax Ukraine&apos;s undisclosed source, Naiev has been appointed to command the Velyka Novosilka tactical group. The occupied village of Velyka Novosilka lies some 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of the administrative border between the Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk oblasts. The Ukrainian military reported that Russia has stepped up attacks in the southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast over the past few weeks but denied Russian claims of capturing the village of Stepove. Throughout the fall of 2024, Russian forces made operational gains in Donetsk Oblast, including areas near Toretsk and Chasiv Yar. Fighting remains intense in the eastern region, and Russian troops continue to advance, albeit slowly, this year.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-troops-withdraw-from-some-positions-in-donetsk-oblast-to-strengthen-defenses-commander-says/	2025-03-18T03:06:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2098827955.jpg
Poland, Baltics to withdraw from anti-personnel mine ban treaty	Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland announced on March 18 their intention to withdraw from the Ottawa Convention, an international treaty banning the use, production, and stockpiling of anti-personnel mines, the Lithuanian Defense Ministry said. The defense ministers of the four nations argued that the security situation in the region has &quot;fundamentally deteriorated&quot; and that military threats to NATO member states bordering Russia and Belarus have &quot;significantly increased.&quot; &quot;Given the volatile security environment, all measures to strengthen deterrence and defense capabilities must be assessed,&quot; the ministers said, emphasizing their willingness to take all necessary steps to defend their territories. The statement added that despite their withdrawal, the countries would remain committed to international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians during armed conflicts. The decision still requires approval by the countries&apos; parliaments. Tensions between NATO and Russia have risen following Moscow&apos;s all-out attack against Ukraine. Western leaders and intelligence agencies have warned of a potential large-scale war in Europe within the next five years, citing Russia&apos;s increasingly aggressive posture. The move signals a significant shift in defense policy for these front-line NATO states as they prepare for potential aggression from Moscow. The step follows Lithuania&apos;s withdrawal from the convention banning cluster munitions, a weapon widely used in the Russia-Ukraine war.	https://kyivindependent.com/estonia-latvia-lithuania-poland-to-withdraw-from-anti-personnel-mine-ban-treaty/	2025-03-18T02:57:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2154604513.jpg
Trump's aid cuts disrupt supply of HIV treatments to Ukraine, 7 more countries	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s suspension of foreign aid has disrupted the supply of HIV treatments to Ukraine and seven other countries, potentially reversing two decades of progress in fighting the disease, Reuters reported on March 17, citing the World Health Organization (WHO). WHO warned that Kenya, Haiti, Lesotho, Burkina Faso, Mali, Nigeria, South Sudan, and Ukraine could run out of critical antiretroviral drugs in the coming months. HIV treatments are essential in preventing the virus from progressing to AIDS and maintaining the health of those infected. &quot;The disruptions to HIV programs could undo 20 years of progress,&quot; WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference, adding that the crisis could result in over 10 million additional HIV cases and 3 million related deaths. On March 10, the Trump administration announced the termination of 83% of the U.S. Agency for International Development&apos;s (USAID) foreign aid contracts. The cuts have broad implications for humanitarian efforts, particularly in Ukraine, where USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and over $30 billion in direct budget support since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began. Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump and head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has spearheaded efforts to dismantle USAID, eliminating staff positions and attacking the agency&apos;s work in public. Musk is currently listed as the world&apos;s richest man alive. The funding suspension poses a significant threat to various Ukrainian organizations and projects that rely on U.S. assistance across multiple sectors. The move aligns with Trump&apos;s broader strategy of reducing foreign aid, despite concerns from health officials and humanitarian organizations that such cuts will worsen global health crises.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-aid-freeze-disrupts-hiv-treatment-in-ukraine-seven-more-countries/	2025-03-18T02:38:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197486320.jpg
Italy, Spain hesitant on EU's $43 billion military aid to Ukraine plan	Italy and Spain have signaled reluctance to support the European Union&apos;s proposal to allocate up to 40 billion euros ($43 billion) in military aid to Ukraine this year, Reuters reported on March 17. The initiative to double EU military aid for Ukraine has &quot;broad political support&quot; among member states, according to EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas. However, divisions persist, particularly between countries geographically closer to Russia &#x2014; such as Estonia, Denmark, and Lithuania &#x2014; which have committed more than 2% of their GDP to aid Kyiv, and those further away, which have contributed less. At the EU foreign ministers&apos; meeting in Brussels on March 17, Italy and Spain, the third- and fourth-largest economies in the bloc, took a cautious approach. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said the proposal needed further discussion and that Italy was awaiting the outcome of the upcoming call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. &quot;We are waiting for the Trump-Putin telephone call to see if there will be any steps forward in order to reach a ceasefire,&quot; Tajani said. The U.S. president is set to hold a phone call with Putin on March 18 to discuss ending Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine and a temporary ceasefire. Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares echoed this sentiment, saying, &quot;We will see how the debate goes, but there is no decision on the matter yet.&quot; He noted that Spain had already committed 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in military aid to Ukraine this year. Both Hungary and Slovakia have refused to provide military aid to Ukraine, but EU officials say they cannot obstruct the plan since contributions will be voluntary. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has consistently delayed EU sanctions on Russia and military assistance for Ukraine, aligning himself with Trump&apos;s approach and expressing hopes for a swift resolution to the war. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has previously promoted pro-Russian narratives on Ukraine and the war and met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last December to discuss gas transit issues ahead of Ukraine&apos;s planned transit halt.	https://kyivindependent.com/italy-spain-hesitant-on-eus-40-billion-military-aid-to-ukraine-plan/	2025-03-18T02:03:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1708750246.jpg
Trump boasts of saving Ukrainian soldiers in Kursk Oblast despite Kyiv denying encirclement claims	U.S. President Donald Trump claimed on March 17 that he took an unspecified action to save Ukrainian soldiers in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, repeating an unsubstantiated claim of them being &quot;surrounded.&quot; Kyiv has denied that its troops in the Russian border region would be encircled, despite acknowledging a retreat from the town of Sudzha amid a rapid Russian advance. &quot;They&#x2019;re surrounded by Russian soldiers, and I believe if it wasn&#x2019;t for me, they wouldn&#x2019;t be here any longer,&quot; Trump said at a briefing, according to the AP news agency. The U.S. president has not specified what steps he has taken or provided evidence of Ukraine&apos;s purported encirclement. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024 but reportedly lost much of the territory following a Russian counterattack earlier this month. Russian advances, reinforced by North Korean troops, coincided with the U.S. pausing intelligence and military support for Ukraine. Talking to journalists, Trump voiced his belief that the pause did not negatively impact the Ukrainian positions in Kursk Oblast. Trump made the comments ahead of a planned call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 18 to discuss a possible peace deal for Ukraine. The U.S. president said that &quot;many elements of a Final Agreement have been agreed to, but much remains.&quot; The two leaders are expected to discuss a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire, which was agreed upon between Kyiv and Washington during talks in Saudi Arabia on March 11. After Ukraine backed the truce, the U.S. resumed its military and intelligence support. On March 13, Putin signaled openness to the ceasefire but demanded guarantees that Ukraine would not mobilize, train troops, or receive military aid during the truce, raising concerns about renewed Russian aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-boasts-of-saving-ukrainian-soldiers-in-kursk-oblast-despite-kyiv-denying-encirclement-claims/	2025-03-18T01:34:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167241344.jpg
Russian energy giant Gazprom suffers $13.1 billion loss in 2024	The loss of a key European market has dealt a severe financial blow to Russian energy giant Gazprom, resulting in net losses of 1.076 trillion rubles ($13.1 billion) in 2024, the Moscow Times reported on March 18. Gazprom&apos;s losses averaged $251 million per week, $35 million per day, or $1.4 million per hour. While the company&apos;s total revenue increased by 11% and its gas revenue by 14%, it still ended the year with a sales loss of 192 billion rubles ($2.3 billion). The company&apos;s financial troubles were compounded by falling share prices in its subsidiary Gazprom Neft and an increased income tax rate of 25%, which raised deferred tax liabilities. In 2023, Gazprom posted a net loss under international accounting standards for the first time in 25 years, recording a historic deficit of 629 billion rubles ($7.6 billion). Despite attempts to maintain its presence in Europe, Gazprom&apos;s gas exports to the EU remained low. In 2023, the company delivered 32 billion cubic meters of gas to Europe, nearly six times less than its peak of over 180 billion cubic meters in 2018-2019. The downturn has forced Gazprom to implement cost-cutting measures, including mass layoffs. On Jan. 13, Russian media outlet 47News reported that the company was preparing to lay off 1,600 employees from its central office. Gazprom&apos;s financial woes stem largely from the EU&apos;s decision to reduce reliance on Russian energy following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Compounding its troubles, Russia&apos;s direct pipeline gas supplies to the EU have ceased completely after Ukraine refused to extend its transit agreement with Gazprom beyond Dec. 31, 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-energy-giant-gazprom-suffers-13-1-billion-loss-in-2024/	2025-03-18T00:54:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/upd_GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
2 killed, 13 injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed at least two civilians and injured at least 13 over the past day, regional authorities reported on March 18. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 63 of the 137 Russian attack and decoy drones overnight over 12 oblasts, the Air Force said. Sixty-four decoy drones reportedly disappeared from radars without causing damage. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian attacks injured three people in Pokrovsk and two in Kostiantynivka, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. A woman was injured during a drone attack against the village of Riasne in Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. A school, a gymnasium, houses, and enterprises were damaged elsewhere in the region. Two people were killed and seven injured during Russian strikes in Kherson Oblast, said Oleksandr Prokudin, the regional governor. Twelve houses, a humanitarian aid distribution point, and a car were damaged. Air defenses were operating in Kyiv overnight amid a Russian drone attack. Drone wreckage fell on the territory of a school in the Desnianskyi district, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said, without mentioning any casualties.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-134/	2025-03-18T00:32:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-18_09-14-56.jpg
Russia 'not losing hope' ahead of planned Putin-Trump call, top Putin aide says	Russia is not &quot;losing hope&quot; ahead of a planned call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump, Putin&apos;s aide Yuri Ushakov told pro-Kremlin news outlet Kommersant on March 18. &quot;It&apos;s been a week since the proposal (for a 30-day ceasefire). And what are we seeing? The most powerful attack by the Ukrainian Armed Forces drones on Russian territory in history. And then another attack. But we are not losing hope! We cling to everything,&quot; Ushakov said. Russian authorities claimed to have intercepted 337 Ukrainian drones across multiple regions on March 11, marking the largest drone strike against Russia during the full-scale war. Meanwhile, Russia continues its near-daily attacks on Ukrainian cities, launching missiles and drones at civilian and energy infrastructure. The planned call between Trump and Putin follows U.S.-led negotiations in Saudi Arabia, where Washington proposed a 30-day ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. Kyiv accepted the deal during bilateral talks in Jeddah on March 11, leading the U.S. to resume military and intelligence support for Ukraine. On March 13, Putin said Russia was also open to the ceasefire but demanded guarantees that Ukraine would halt mobilization, military training, and foreign aid deliveries during the truce, potentially leaving it vulnerable to renewed Russian offensives. Trump has confirmed that he will speak with Putin on March 18, saying that many elements of a potential peace agreement are already in place. &quot;Thousands of young soldiers, and others, are being killed. Each week brings 2,500 soldier deaths, and it must end now,&quot; Trump wrote on Truth Social on March 17, without providing evidence to back up the figure. The U.S. president previously held a call with Putin on Feb. 12, after which he announced that negotiations to end the war would begin &quot;immediately.&quot; The upcoming talks are seen as a crucial moment in assessing whether the U.S. and Russia can negotiate a ceasefire that is acceptable to both Ukraine and Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-not-losing-hope-ahead-of-planned-putin-trump-call-top-putin-aide-says/	2025-03-18T00:25:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-810261630.jpg
UK, EU to discuss confiscating Russian assets ahead of Ukraine peace talks, Bloomberg reports	The U.K. and the European Union will discuss confiscating Russian assets to ramp up economic pressure on Moscow ahead of possible peace talks on Ukraine, Bloomberg reported on March 17, citing unnamed sources. Negotiations will reportedly focus on establishing the legal and financial framework to seize Russian assets despite opposition from some EU member states, particularly Belgium and Germany. Western nations froze roughly $300 billion in Russian assets after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with roughly two-thirds held in Europe. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and EU diplomacy chief Kaja Kallas are expected to discuss the issue during their meeting on March 18, according to Bloomberg. The talks will also cover the EU&apos;s proposal to invest 150 billion euros ($163 billion) of EU loans in armaments for third countries, including the U.K., Norway, and Switzerland. While Ukraine has received loans backed by the interest earned from these assets, Kyiv has repeatedly called for full confiscation to fund its defense and reconstruction. In October 2024, the Group of Seven (G7) agreed to provide Ukraine with nearly $50 billion in loans backed by the revenue generated from frozen Russian assets.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-eu-to-discuss-confiscating-russian-assets-ahead-of-ukraine-peace-talks/	2025-03-17T23:49:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1561898437.jpg
Telegram CEO Durov returns to Dubai amid French investigation	Pavel Durov, Telegram&apos;s Russian-born founder and CEO, said on March 17 that he had returned to Dubai after spending several months in France over an investigation into criminal activity on his messaging app. The entrepreneur, who also holds French and Emirati citizenship, said that the investigating judges allowed him to depart even though the probe is ongoing. Durov was arrested at the Le Bourget airport outside of Paris in August 2024 and faces numerous charges related to his social network, including allowing terrorism, drug trafficking, fraud, money laundering, and child abuse content on Telegram. The founder of the messaging app faces up to 20 years in prison. &quot;As you may have heard, I&#x2019;ve returned to Dubai after spending several months in France due to an investigation related to the activity of criminals on Telegram,&quot; the businessman said on his personal Telegram channel. &quot;The process is ongoing, but it feels great to be home.&quot; Durov left France on March 15 after the judges allowed him to stay abroad for &quot;several weeks,&quot; undisclosed sources told the AFP news agency. Telegram is one of the world&apos;s top messaging apps, with over 950 million users worldwide. Durov, with a net worth estimated at $15.5 billion, left Russia in 2014 after refusing to comply with government demands to shut down opposition communities on his VK social media platform, which he subsequently sold. An investigation by an independent Ukrainian group nevertheless revealed that Durov had visited Russia more than 60 times since 2014, contradicting the businessman&apos;s claims of being an exile and a pariah in his home country.	https://kyivindependent.com/telegram-ceo-durov-returns-to-dubai-amid-french-investigation/	2025-03-17T23:45:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-527244438--1-.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 897,010 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 897,010 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on March 18. The number includes 1,560 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,352 tanks, 21,509 armored fighting vehicles, 40,892 vehicles and fuel tanks, 24,640 artillery systems, 1,319 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,107 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 29,616 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-897-010-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-03-17T23:10:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1669833933.jpg
Trump administration weighs recognizing Crimea as Russian territory, Semafor reports	The Trump administration is considering recognizing Crimea as Russian territory as part of a broader deal to end Russia&#x2019;s war on Ukraine, two sources familiar with the discussions told Semafor. Officials have also explored urging the United Nations to follow suit, aligning U.S. policy with Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s long-held stance on the region. The potential move comes as Trump prepares for a call with Putin on March 18, with a proposed 30-day ceasefire on the table. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump hinted that negotiators had already discussed &quot;dividing up certain assets.&quot; However, the White House has not made a final decision. In a statement, National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes denied any commitments, emphasizing that the administration would not negotiate through the media. U.S. officials have previously suggested that Ukraine may need to make territorial concessions to end the war. Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged the suffering of Ukrainians but argued that some form of compromise might be necessary. However, Kyiv has consistently rejected any territorial losses, and European allies would likely oppose such a shift in U.S. policy. Despite continued international recognition of Crimea as part of Ukraine, experts question whether Kyiv can retake the peninsula through military means. President Volodymyr Zelensky admitted last year that Crimea&#x2019;s return would likely require diplomatic efforts, which Russia has been unwilling to entertain. Trump has floated the idea of recognizing Crimea as Russian since before his presidency. In a 2018 interview, he suggested that Crimeans preferred Russian rule, saying, &quot;You have to look at that, also.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-administration-weighs-recognizing-crimea-as-russian-territory-semafor-reports/	2025-03-17T22:58:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1269925382.jpg
European nations urge UN action against Russian satellite sabotage, media reports	Eight European nations have filed a complaint with the U.N. over Russia&#x2019;s interference with European satellite communications, according to documents obtained by the Dutch current affairs television program, Nieuwsuur. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine, Finland, France, and the Netherlands signed the complaint, urging Russia to stop its alleged sabotage. Seventeen other EU countries and the United Kingdom have expressed support for the initiative. The complaint was submitted to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the top global body overseeing satellite communications. The disruptions have targeted Eutelsat and SES, Europe&#x2019;s main satellite providers, which support television, radio, and aviation navigation systems. Last year, Eutelsat and SES traced the interference to Russian-controlled areas, specifically occupied Crimea and Kaliningrad. The most striking incident occurred when Russian war propaganda suddenly appeared on BabyTV in the Netherlands and other European countries. Similar disruptions affected Ukrainian television channels. France and Sweden, where the satellite companies are based, have launched direct discussions with Russia at the U.N. in Geneva this week. However, previous attempts to engage Moscow in dialogue over the past year have largely failed. The interference poses serious risks beyond media disruption. Russia distorts navigation signals to confuse GPS-guided drones in Ukraine, but this also affects civilian aviation and maritime traffic. Since September 2023, more than 30,000 flights over the Baltic region have suffered interference, endangering safety and economic activity. Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia warned in their complaint of the &quot;serious consequences&quot; these disruptions could have.	https://kyivindependent.com/european-nations-urge-un-action-against-russian-satellite-sabotage-media-reports/	2025-03-17T21:27:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203401182.jpg
We had to get Ukraine to do the right thing' — Trump on his Oval Office clash with Zelensky	U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 17 that his argument with President Volodymyr Zelensky during the Ukrainian leader&apos;s visit to the Oval Office was part of a strategy to pressure Ukraine. &quot;A lot of people are being killed over there and we had to get Ukraine to do the right thing. It was not an easy situation,&quot; Trump told reporters at the Kennedy Center. &quot;You got to see a little glimpse at the Oval Office, but I think they are doing the right thing now, and we are trying to get the peace agreement done. We want to get ceasefire and then a peace agreement.&quot; Zelensky and Trump held a tense 45-minute press briefing in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, which ended in a heated argument over U.S. aid to Ukraine and the cancellation of a planned mineral agreement. After the meeting, Trump accused Zelensky of disrespecting the U.S. and said on Truth Social that &quot;he can come back when he is ready for peace.&quot; The dispute escalated during the press conference following Zelensky&apos;s response to remarks by U.S. Vice President JD Vance. Following the argument, the Trump administration suspended intelligence and military aid to Ukraine for about a week. Tensions started to ease by March 4, when Zelensky apologized to Trump, expressing readiness to work with Trump&apos;s leadership for lasting peace and reiterating Ukraine&apos;s commitment to ending the war. Trump previously said he plans to have a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 18. The planned call follows U.S.-led talks in Saudi Arabia, where Washington proposed a 30-day Russia-Ukraine ceasefire. Kyiv accepted the deal on March 11, leading the U.S. to resume military and intelligence support. On March 13, Putin signaled Russia&apos;s willingness but demanded guarantees that Ukraine wouldn&apos;t mobilize, train troops, or receive military aid during the truce, raising concerns about renewed Russian aggression. &quot;It&apos;s a bad situation in Russia, and it&apos;s a bad situation in Ukraine,&quot; Trump said. &quot;What&apos;s happening in Ukraine is not good, but we&apos;re going to see if we can work a peace agreement, a ceasefire, and I think we will be able to do it. &#xA0;And I&apos;m speaking to President Putin tomorrow morning.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/we-had-to-get-ukraine-to-do-the-right-thing-trump-on-his-oval-office-clash-with-zelensky/	2025-03-17T20:42:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2154393954.jpg
Belarus authorities sentence Japanese citizen to 7 years in prison on espionage charges	A Japanese man was sentenced in Minsk on March 17 to seven years in prison on changes stemming from &quot;espionage activity,&quot; Belarus&#x2019; Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said. Authorities convicted Nakanishi for allegedly taking over 9,000 photos of civilian and military infrastructure. The man was accused of taking photos of military facilities and railway infrastructure. Belarusian authorities also claimed Nakanishi traveled to the Ukrainian border. Under the regime of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, Minsk has imprisoned hundreds of political prisoners, convicting a number hundreds of people under the guise of anti-state activity. According to the Viasna human rights monitoring group, there are currently 1,213 political prisoners in Belarus. Masatoshi Nakanishi has been in custody since July for allegedly spying for a foreign intelligence agency between 2018 and 2024, local authorities said. Nakanishi&apos;s arrest was only publicly announced in September, despite his arrest several months prior. The Japanese Embassy in Belarus was barred from attending the court proceedings which ended on March 17. Nakanishi, who live in the bordering city of Gomel and taught at a local university, was convicted by the Minsk City Court in a closed-door trial that spanned over the course of two months. &quot;Like other political prisoners, he is being dehumanized by regime propaganda,&quot; Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said in a post to X on March 17, calling for Nakanishi&apos;s immediate release. Japan&apos;s Embassy in Belarus also told Japanese media outlet NHK that is was calling for immediate release.	https://kyivindependent.com/japanese-man-sentenced-to-7-years-in-belarus-for-espionage-charges/	2025-03-17T18:54:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1763147709.jpg
Over 30 countries expected to contribute to UK-led 'coalition of the willing,' official says	Over 30 countries are prepared to contribute to the &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; peacekeeping force to support Ukraine, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer&apos;s spokesperson said on March 17. Talks have been ongoing among Ukraine&apos;s allies to establish a peacekeeping force to monitor a potential ceasefire along Ukraine&apos;s eastern front. Starmer proposed that 10,000 troops could be part of the force at a London summit on March 15. &quot;The UK expects more than 30 countries to be involved in the coalition of the willing... There would be a significant force with a significant number of countries,&quot; the spokesperson said, adding that a &quot;significant number&quot; of countries would provide troops, without specifying how many countries that may be. Other countries involved in the coalition would provide military equipment and support the peacekeeping force in different ways, Starmer&apos;s spokesperson said. &quot;The contribution capabilities will vary, but this will be a significant force, with a significant number of countries providing troops and a larger group contributing in other ways,&quot; Starmer&apos;s spokesperson added. Although many many countries have refrained from publicly committing to providing support, a number of countries including Ireland, Canada, and Australia have suggested they would participate in the group. Other countries, like Poland and Finland have voiced they will retain troops on their own territory to deter Russian aggression. Starmer&apos;s spokesperson echoed concerns that a peacekeeping force would need U.S. backing. &quot;The PM has said that for the coalition of the willing and U.K. troops to be deployed it must be in the context of a secure and lasting peace with U.S. backing being needed. Those discussions are ongoing,&quot; the spokesperson said. Thus far, the U.S. has ruled out providing security guarantees and deploying its own troops in Ukraine to enforce a ceasefire.	https://kyivindependent.com/more-than-30-countries-to-provide-troops-for-uk-led-ukraine-peacekeeping-force/	2025-03-17T17:53:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2157532257.jpg
Critical Ukraine coverage at risk as Trump slashes Radio Free Europe funding	The U.S. decision to cut off funding for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty came as a surprise for the outlet&#x2019;s newsroom, a source in the RFE/RL&apos;s Ukrainian Service told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;We understood that the U.S. president, to put it mildly, does not like us,&#x201D; the source said on March 17. &#x201C;But there is bipartisan support, there is approved funding, and we had an (approved) budget at least until the end of this fiscal year. No one expected that they would cut off funding in the middle of the year like that.&#x201D; U.S. President Donald Trump eliminated seven federal agencies on March 14, including the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees RFE/RL and Voice of America (VoA). The decision terminated the Congress-authorized grant that funded RFE/RL, while the Voice of America&#x2019;s employees were put on administrative leave. The move seeks to effectively end over seven decades of work of the U.S.-sponsored media outlets, launched to promote democracy and counter propaganda in authoritarian countries. The decision was welcomed by Russian propagandists, who took to Russian state TV to praise it. In Ukraine, the decision comes as a yet another blow to the country&#x2019;s media, which has already suffered greatly from the freeze of the USAID programs in January. The freeze left many Ukrainian independent media outlets, including local front-line newsrooms and investigative projects, without funding. Now, Ukraine&apos;s media landscape may risk to lose the robust local RFE/RL bureau. &#xA0; For years, RFE/RL has been one of the most reliable sources for millions of Ukrainians. Around 14% of Ukrainians regularly tuned into the RFE/RL&#x2019;s coverage, according to a Gallup World Poll, conducted in July 2023. The same poll showed that &#x201C;95% of the audience&#x201D; trusted the Radio&#x2019;s coverage. As of late 2024, the company employed a team of more than 100 people in Ukraine, said Maryana Drach, RFE/RL&apos;s Ukrainian Service director. For the Kyiv-based bureau, the halt would bring an end to several prominent projects, including investigations of corruption and Russian aggression, front-line coverage, and coverage of Ukraine&#x2019;s occupied territories. The team in Kyiv continues work, reportedly hoping to restore or replace the lost funding. &#x201C;Everyone is in a waiting mode,&#x201D; the source told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Today we heard at one of the meetings with the management that they keep fighting.&#x201D; The RFE/RL&apos;s Ukrainian Service began operation on Aug. 16, 1954, in Munich under the initial name Radio Liberation, becoming one of the view free media outlets reachable by the citizens of the Soviet Union.During the Cold War, RFE/RL faced surveillance, provocations, and even terrorist attacks. In 1981, a bomb was planted at the headquarters of RFE/RL in Munich, injuring six people. In modern Russia, Radio Free Europe has witnessed a similar fate. In 2017, Russia labeled Voice of America and Radio Free Europe &#x201C;foreign agents.&#x201D; Five years later, Moscow added RFE/RL to the list of &#x201C;undesirable&#x201D; organizations. The registries have been widely used to target and silence groups and individuals who are critical of the government, including independent journalists, activists, and NGOs. RFE/RL President and CEO Stephen Capus said that the cancelation of the organization&apos;s funding &#x201C;would be a massive gift to America&#x2019;s enemies.&#x201D; &#x201C;The Iranian Ayatollahs, Chinese communist leaders, and autocrats in Moscow and Minsk would celebrate the demise of RFE/RL after 75 years. Handing our adversaries a win would make them stronger and America weaker,&#x201D; he said. In Ukraine, the funding freeze risks ending several projects that were a long-time staple of local journalism, including coverage of occupied territories and investigations unveiling top-level corruption. &#xA0; Since its launch in 2014, the Schemes investigative journalism program, a unit of the Radio&#x2019;s Kyiv bureau, has been investigating corruption and wrongdoing of Ukrainian elites. They have not shunned from investigating oligarchs and sitting presidents, having published investigations featuring President Volodymyr Zelensky and his predecessor, Petro Poroshenko. After the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, the Schemes project started investigating Russian war crimes and Russian officials, while also continuing to uncover corruption in Ukraine.

(STR/NurPhoto via Getty Images)The other two trademark projects of RFE/RL in Ukraine &#x2014; Crimea Realities and Donbas Realities &#x2014; served as the key sources of information about the Russian-occupied territories. Ukrainian journalist Artem Lysak worked as a reporter for Crimea Realities from 2016 to 2019. He used to visit the Russian-occupied peninsula undercover. He covered the persecution of Crimean Tatars and the illegal construction of the Crimean Bridge. &#x201C;The Crimea Realities project is as important now as it was from the beginning of (Russia&#x2019;s) invasion (of Crimea). Since we know that there is practically no freedom of speech in Crimea, just like in Russia,&#x201D; Lysak told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;It remains one of the media outlets that constantly monitors the situation and gives at least some kind of true picture for the people in Crimea. There are no other projects like Crimea Realities in Ukraine, unfortunately,&#x201D; he said. During his reporting trips, Lysak faced interrogations and surveillance by Russia&#x2019;s Federal Security Service (FSB) in Crimea. When his lawyer suspected that a criminal case might be fabricated against the journalist, Lysak decided to leave the peninsula. For their work, RFE/RL&#x2019;s journalists have repeatedly faced persecution by the Kremlin. Mykola Semena, a former observer of Crimea Realities, faced Russia&#x2019;s trumped-up charges for his journalism in Crimea in January 2016. He was able to leave the peninsula in 2020. Another Ukrainian RFE/RL journalist, Vladyslav Yesypenko, was illegally detained in Crimea by Russia in 2021 and remains behind bars to this day. Writer and former journalist Stanislav Aseyev, who worked for RFE/RL, said that he was tortured in Russian-occupied Donetsk for being affiliated with Radio Liberty. &#x201C;I once was electrocuted only for writing for Radio Liberty: I was told that it was &#x2018;a CIA structure and an enemy of Russia,&#x2019; and for that reason alone I was already guilty,&#x201D; Aseyev wrote. The writer was abducted by Russian proxies in 2017 and jailed in the infamous Izolyatsia prisoner camp in Donetsk. He was released in December 2019 in a prisoner exchange. &#x201C;Now, the &#x2018;enemy of Russia&#x2019; is being destroyed by America itself, and my torture seems in vain,&#x201D; Aseyev said.

(Yuliia Ovsiannikova / Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images)What&apos;s next for RFE/RL?Days after the U.S. decision, Ukrainian journalists of RFE/RL continue their work, although the service&apos;s future remains unclear. The source in RFE/RL&apos;s Ukrainian Service told the Kyiv Independent that there&#x2019;s funding through the end of March. &#x201C;The management hopes to get support from (U.S.) Congress, other organizations. There is hope that we will use this time effectively and will be able to somehow return back. There is an expectation that there will be some dissatisfaction in Congress, or maybe we can somehow, so to speak, cancel President (Trump&#x2019;s) decision,&#x201D; the source said. According to the source, support from the European Union is also considered as an alternative source of funding. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said EU foreign ministers discussed the functioning of RFE/RL at a meeting in Brussels on March 17. The bloc cannot automatically fund Radio Free Europe, she said, adding that the EU will look into potential options. Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky did not rule out that the European Union can buy Radio Free Europe from the U.S. Lysak said, citing his colleagues, that the Ukrainian Service has in the meantime parted ways with its freelance journalists. The RFE/RL source confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that contracts with all freelancers have been terminated, adding that the decision, however, was made about a week ago. This move was made to save money amid the U.S. budget uncertainty. &#xA0; &#x201C;If a week ago we were wondering where to get money to pay back the freelancers, now the question arises whether the service will work at all,&#x201D; they said.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-decision-to-cut-radio-free-europe-funding-leaves-ukraines-service-in-limbo/	2025-03-17T15:36:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203986537.jpg
Putin should drop 'absurd demands' in peace talks with Trump, Polish Foreign Minister says	Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said on March 17 that it was his hope that U.S. President Donald Trump will get Russian President Vladimir Putin to abandon &quot;some absurd demands&quot; toward establishing a peace deal in Ukraine. Trump is set to hold a phone call with Putin on March 18 to discuss ending Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. &quot;(W)e will measure the success of Trump&apos;s talks by the quality of the negotiated peace,&quot; Sikorski said at an EU foreign ministers summit in Brussels. Ukraine agreed to a temporary 30-day ceasefire proposed by the U.S. on March 11 following talk in Jeddah, provided Russia also agrees to it. On March 13, Putin said Russia was also willing to accept the ceasefire but demanded guarantees that Ukraine would not mobilize troops, conduct training, or receive military assistance during the truce, making it potentially vulnerable to renewed Russian aggression. Russia has repeatedly demanded Ukraine hand over the entirety of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson Oblasts despite not fully controlling them. Russia has also opposed the deployment of peacekeepers to Ukraine in a potential peace deal and insisted Ukraine be demilitarized, neutral, and barred from joining NATO. &quot;It is clear who wants peace and who wants war. Russia will want to take over all of Ukraine by other means, and preferably militarily neutralize half of Europe while at it. Russia won&#x2019;t succeed in that... (but that) doesn&#x2019;t mean Putin won&#x2019;t try,&quot; Sikorski said. &quot;Putin could finish this war in 5 minutes by just withdrawing,&quot; he added. The U.K. news outlet the Independent reported on March 16, citing senior Ukrainian officials, that Ukraine is ready to negotiate a peace deal with Russia, but remains firm on several areas, including the return of children and civilians, no further ceding of territory, as well as establishing international security guarantees.	https://kyivindependent.com/sikorski-hopes-putin-drops-absurd-demands-in-peace-talks-amid-upcoming-call-with-trump/	2025-03-17T15:28:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2172451145.jpg
We’ve never been closer to a peace deal,' White House says ahead of Trump-Putin call	White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on March 17 that the Trump administration believes they have &quot;never been closer&quot; to closing a ceasefire deal in Ukraine, ahead of a call scheduled between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin for March 18. &quot;I won&apos;t get ahead of those negotiations (between Trump and Putin) but I can say we are on the 10th yard line of peace,&quot; Leavitt said at a press briefing, using an American football analogy to suggest a resolution is within reach. &quot;We&#x2019;ve never been closer to a peace deal than we are in this moment and the president is determined to get one done.&quot; Trump said on March 17 that he plans to have a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. The planned call follows U.S.-led negotiations in Saudi Arabia, where Washington proposed a 30-day ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. Kyiv accepted the deal during talks in Jeddah on March 11, prompting the U.S. to resume military and intelligence support for Ukraine. On March 13, Putin said Russia was also willing to accept the ceasefire but demanded guarantees that Ukraine would not mobilize troops, conduct training, or receive military assistance during the truce, making it potentially vulnerable to renewed Russian aggression. &quot;I think we have a lot of it already discussed very much by both sides, Ukraine and Russia. We&apos;re already talking about that, dividing up certain assets,&quot; Trump said on Air Force One. When asked by reporters whether dividing up territory and power plants between Ukraine and Russia has been part of the discussions between Kyiv and Washington, Leavitt confirmed &quot;that has been part of the discussion,&quot; but would not preemptively say whether Trump will discuss the issue with Putin on March 18. The White House has insisted that both Russia and Ukraine will have to make compromises in order to end the war, calling Ukraine&apos;s goal of restoring its pre-2014 borders &quot;unrealistic.&quot; The U.K. news outlet the Independent reported on March 16, citing senior Ukrainian officials, that Ukraine is ready to negotiate a peace deal with Russia, but remains firm on several areas, including the return of children and civilians, no further ceding of territory, as well as establishing international security guarantees.	https://kyivindependent.com/weve-never-been-closer-to-a-peace-deal-white-house-says-ahead-of-trump-putin-call/	2025-03-17T14:19:26-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/gettyimages-2205572300-612x612.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukrainian military refutes claim that Russia captured Zaporizhzhia Oblast village	Key developments on March 17: The Russian Defense Ministry claimed Russian forces captured the Ukrainian village of Stepove in Zaporizhzhia Oblast on March 17. Ukraine&apos;s Southern Defense Forces spokesperson Vladyslav Voloshyn denied the statement. Stepove, with a pre-war population of 118 people, is located 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the villages of Pyatykhatky and Mali Shcherbaky in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. All three settlements were under Russian occupation in 2022 and 2023. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that its military had taken control of Stepove. However, Voloshyn told the Kyiv Independent that Ukrainian forces did not lose ground in the Zaporizhzhia sector of the front line. &quot;This is a method of information warfare &#x2014; the enemy claims that it is there before it has entered. I do not confirm the information that Russia entered the settlements of Stepove, Mali Shcherbaky, or Shcherbaky and took them under control,&quot; Voloshyn said. &quot;Fierce fighting continues in this area. The enemy is trying to change the configuration of the combat line in its favor. In total, six combat engagements were registered in the Orikhiv sector over the last day. The day before yesterday, there were 19,&quot; Voloshyn added. According to Voloshyn, since March, Russian forces have intensified their assaults in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Since the beginning of spring, there have been over 130 clashes in the Orikhiv sector alone. The Ukrainian military warned in fall 2024 that Russian forces were ammassing in Zaporizhzhia Oblastin preparation for a southern offensive. Heavy fortifications were constructed around the regional capital of Zaporizhzhia ahead of the possible invasion. The area near Stepove was the main axis of Ukraine&apos;s southern counteroffensive in 2023, which led to the liberation of the settlement of Robotyne but achieved no major breakthrough. Ukrainian drones attacked a fuel and energy facility in Russia&apos;s Astrakhan Oblast on March 17, causing a fire, regional governor Igor Babushkin claimed. &quot;Overnight, the Ukrainian Armed Forces again attempted a massive drone attack on facilities located in the region, including a fuel and energy complex,&quot; Babushkin claimed. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry said its forces had destroyed 13 drones over the oblast. Babushkin reported that fallen debris caused a fire at the facility, and one person was hospitalized. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. Astrakhan Oblast is located in southwestern Russia and borders Kazakhstan. The city of Astrakhan is almost 800 kilometers (500 miles) from the front line in Ukraine. Ukraine has increasingly targeted Russia&apos;s energy and military infrastructure to disrupt Moscow&apos;s war effort. Overnight on March 14, Ukrainian drones struck the Tuapse oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai, igniting a gasoline storage tank. Kyiv has focused on hitting Russian refineries, oil depots, and defense industry sites, aiming to limit Moscow&apos;s ability to sustain its full-scale invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on March 17 in his evening address that a Ukrainian long-range drone has successfully completed testing, demonstrating its ability to fly 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles). &quot;There is good news about long-range drones. Our drone has passed a 3,000-kilometer test,&quot; Zelensky said following a meeting of the Headquarters of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, the top command and control body for Ukraine&#x2019;s defense and security forces. Kyiv uses long-range drones to strike deep into Russian territory, targeting military infrastructure such as airfields, oil refineries, and logistics hubs. During the meeting, participants also discussed a new long-range missile developed by Ukraine, the Long Neptune. &quot;We can say that we are satisfied with the results of the strikes. But we need to produce more missiles, more drones, and we will be talking about this with our partners this week,&quot; Zelensky said. Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk earlier said that the Ukrainian Navy is the only structure of the Ukrainian Armed Forces that uses the Long Neptun missiles. Ukraine has also developed long-range missile-drone hybrids, such as the Palianytsia and Peklo models, featuring turbojet engines as alternatives to cruise missiles. President Volodymyr Zelensky has set a target of producing at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha outlined three key conditions for future negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine in an interview with RBC-Ukraine published on March 17. &quot;I don&apos;t like this definition (red lines). There are fundamental things that are non-negotiable, that cannot be touched upon,&quot; Sybiha said when asked what Ukraine&apos;s red lines are in potential talks. Sybiha stressed that Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity and sovereignty are non-negotiable, reaffirming that Kyiv will never recognize Russian-occupied territories as part of Russia. President Volodymyr Zelenskyvoiced this stance back on March 12. Despite this, the Trump administration has suggested that Kyiv and Moscow must compromise on a peace deal, calling Ukraine&apos;s goal of restoring its pre-2014 borders &quot;unrealistic.&quot; Russian forces currently occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine, where reports of systematic repression, torture, and forced deportations continue to emerge. According to Sybiha, the second key condition is Ukraine&apos;s right to choose its alliances. He emphasized that no country should have a veto over Ukraine&apos;s NATO and EU aspirations. Kyiv officially applied to join NATO in September 2022, and in 2024, the alliance declared Ukraine&apos;s path to membership &quot;irreversible,&quot; though no formal invitation has been extended. Sybiha also underscored that Ukraine&apos;s ability to defend itself must remain unrestricted, meaning there can be no restrictions on the Ukrainian Armed Forces. &quot;Russia must be held accountable. These are all elements of a lasting peace,&quot; he said. On March 13, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was willing to accept a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire but demanded guarantees that Kyiv would halt mobilization, military training, and foreign aid deliveries &#x2014; conditions that could leave Ukraine vulnerable to renewed aggression. U.S. President Donald Trump is set to speak with Putin on March 18 to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. While Trump seeks to secure a deal, European allies and Ukraine warn that a rushed agreement without security guarantees may fail to ensure lasting peace. President Volodymyr Zelensky has signed a law allowing Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces to be sent abroad during martial law, according to an official decree published on March 17. The law aims to enhance defense cooperation with partner nations, particularly by enabling Ukrainian forces to participate in training and receive military equipment, lawmaker Oleksii Honcharenkoexplained. &quot;This will allow us to attract international support to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s defense faster and more effectively,&quot; Honcharenko posted on Telegram. The legislation permits Ukrainian military units to be deployed to other countries for national security purposes, including repelling armed aggression, protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity, and exercising the right to self-defense under international law. The law does not concern the deployment of Ukrainian troops for combat operations on Russian territory. The decision to send military personnel abroad will be made by the president but requires approval from the Verkhovna Rada, the country&apos;s parliament. Deployments will be subject to a formal request detailing the mission&apos;s objectives, troop numbers, weaponry, and the conditions of their stay abroad. Zelensky vetoed the bill in January and returned it to parliament with amendments clarifying the decision-making process and ensuring compliance with international law. Lawmakers approved the revised version in late February. Ukraine is negotiating with South Korea to hand over two North Korean soldiers taken prisoner by Kyiv, South Korea&apos;s Yonhap news agency reported on March 17. South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and his Ukrainian counterpart Andrii Sybiha discussed the potential transfer of the North Korean prisoners of war (POWs) in a phone call. Cho noted that under South Korea&apos;s Constitution, North Koreans are considered South Korean citizens, but the prisoners must express a desire to relocate. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast last fall to counter Ukraine&apos;s cross-border incursion launched in August 2024. Ukrainian troops captured two North Korean soldiers as POWs on Jan. 11. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously reported that North Korean forces fighting for Russia had suffered 4,000 casualties, with two-thirds of the losses being soldiers killed. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, attributed the high losses to North Korea&apos;s lack of combat experience and its use of human wave attacks with limited equipment.

New Canadian prime minister invites Zelensky to attend G7 summit in June	Newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has invited President Volodymyr Zelensky to attend the Group of Seven (G7) summit in June, Le Journal de Quebec reported on March 17, citing a Canadian Foreign Ministry spokesperson. Canada, which holds the G7 presidency this year, will host the summit on June 15-17 in Kananaskis County, located in the western province of Alberta. Carney had a phone call with Zelensky on March 16 and invited him to the summit, according to the media outlet. Carney was sworn in as Canada&apos;s prime minister on March 14, replacing former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as head of the governing Liberal Party. Trudeau announced his resignation in January. Under Trudeau&apos;s leadership, Canada was a strong ally of Ukraine, providing 19.5 billion Canadian dollars ($13.5 billion) in assistance, including 4.5 billion Canadian dollars ($3.1 billion) in military aid.	https://kyivindependent.com/new-canadian-pm-invites-zelensky-to-attend-g7-summit-in-june/	2025-03-17T12:24:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2205017903.jpg
‘Talk about an invasion is everywhere’ — How Lithuania is preparing for war with Russia	Throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, repeated and escalating warnings of the potential for a wider war have only raised fears in the Baltic states that they could be next in the crosshairs of the Kremlin. Talk about a potential Russian invasion is &quot;very common at parties, gatherings, lunch breaks, water cooler talk,&quot; Gabija Stasiukyne, a 32-year-old fintech professional living in Vilnius, Lithuania, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It&#x2019;s everywhere. The conversation inevitably turns in the direction of &#x2014; what are you going to do?&quot; Lithuania&apos;s government is also taking the threat seriously &#x2014; the country reinstated conscription in 2015, and Vilnius in January committed to spending between 5% and 6% of its GDP on defense annually until at least 2030. &quot;Increasing our military capabilities and strengthening alliances is of utmost importance,&quot; Lithuania&apos;s Defense Minister Dovile &#x160;akaliene, told the Kyiv Independent in written response. &quot;War won&#x2019;t come tomorrow, but we are reinventing our defence in order to be ready to fight tonight. We know every step of our adversary, and are preparing accordingly.&quot; For Lithuania and the Baltic states collectively, Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 once again shone a spotlight on, and raised memories of, a long history of Moscow&apos;s imperialist ambitions. &quot;My great-grandfather was deported (by the Soviets during World War II) to Siberia because he was a teacher, an intelligent man,&quot; Emilija Sikorskyite, a 23-year-old English and French language teacher living in Vilnius,&quot; told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;He never came back. He died there.&quot; Lithuania was the first Soviet republic to proclaim independence in 1990, one year before Ukraine, and joined NATO in 2004, providing the country with the security of the military alliance&apos;s collective defense clause in the event of Russian aggression. But the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, and his increasingly hostile attitude to Europe and Ukraine have left many Lithuanians fearing that being a member of NATO is not the security guarantee it once was.

(Sergei Gapon/AFP via Getty Images)Ignas Zalieckas, a Lithuanian cultural journalist living in Germany, told the Kyiv Independent that the now infamous Oval Office showdown between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky caused &quot;total panic&quot; among his friends and family back home. &quot;Everybody was thinking that NATO is kind of gone,&quot; he said. Western leaders and intelligence agencies have warned of a potential large-scale war in Europe within the next five years, citing Russia&apos;s increasingly aggressive posture, and Lithuania&apos;s geography puts it directly in the firing line. The country shares an eastern border with Russia&apos;s closest ally, Belarus, from whose territory Moscow&apos;s failed attempt to take Kyiv was launched. And to the southwest of Lithuania lies the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, a small piece of land measuring 15,100 square kilometers that is home to the headquarters and main base of Russia&apos;s Baltic Fleet, not to mention thousands of Russian military personnel and a wide array of missiles and other weapons. At their closest point, a mere 40 kilometers separates Kaliningrad and Belarus along a narrow piece of land called the Suwalki Gap which closely tracks the Poland-Lithuania border on the Polish side.

(Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)In the event of a war between NATO and Russia, Russian and Belarusian forces linking up across the Suwalki Gap would cut off the only land route to all three Baltic states. &quot;It&apos;s understandable that the Lithuanian government is worried about this,&quot; Dr Stephen Hall, lecturer in Russian and post-Soviet politics at the University of Bath, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The Baltics have a long history of being occupied by other foreign forces, particularly Russia, and a relatively short history of being independent.&quot; In the face of Russian aggression in Ukraine, and a White House washing its hands of European security, talk of an imminent Russian invasion in Lithuania has now gone into overdrive. Barbora Turauskaite, a master&apos;s student and the head of communication at the Institute of International Relations and Political Science at Vilnius University, told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;all the political science and international relations experts talk about the possibility of war every day.&quot; During one of her classes, a lecturer instructed them to &quot;buy plane tickets for September because war is inevitable.&quot; He went on to tell them that joint Russian and Belarusian military exercises scheduled for September 2025, could serve as a pretext for the build up of a Russian invasion force &#x2014; just as they did before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Like Zalieckas, Turauskaite says the unpredictable nature of Trump is adding to anxiety in the country. &quot;We are not sleeping very well. In Lithuanian time, Trump wakes up around 4 p.m. After that, we don&#x2019;t know what to expect,&quot; she said. Lithuania has been one of Kyiv&apos;s staunchest allies &#x2014; in Vilnius public buses display their routes along with the phrase &quot;Vilnius loves Ukraine,&quot; while the number of Ukrainian flags fluttering from government buildings and private balconies at times seems to compare to that of Lithuania&#x2019;s tricolor flag. This has been matched by consistent military aid, but while the weapons and aid have flowed to Ukraine, the war has had a significant impact on the attitudes and priorities of those back home. Eimantas Cesnys, volunteer soldier from Vilnius, conducts three-day survival courses for ninth-graders, which were implemented after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began. &quot;I joined the military in 2022 or 2023 because my whole life I knew that I would go to fight if necessary,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;And when I saw what happened in Ukraine, I thought that I should be prepared.&quot; Teodoras Grigali&#x16B;nas, a volunteer coordinator with the Lithuanian Red Cross&apos;s civil safety program in Vilnius, told the Kyiv independent he has seen an uptick in people signing up for the course which gives advice on matters such as where to find shelters, electricity, and water supplies in the event of an emergency, and how to pack an emergency &quot;grab bag.&quot; People attend a demonstration marking the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s war on Ukraine in Vilnius, Lithuania, on Feb. 23, 2025.

(Teodoras Grigali&#x16B;nas / Lithuanian Res Cross)&quot;At first, it wasn&#x2019;t a very popular topic and it was sort of hard to get people involved,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;But I do notice a change, a spike in people&apos;s interest, especially after the Zelensky and Trump clash,&quot; he added. Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has provided a blueprint of sorts for what Lithuanians could expect in the event of a worst-case scenario, as well as the motivation to prepare as best as is possible. A thyroid cancer diagnosis prevented Aivaras, a 32-year-old freelance film and TV location manager, from following his younger brother into the Lithuanian military, so instead he registered for a new civil role created last year that will enforce curfews and protect infrastructure if martial law is enacted in the event of war. &quot;I understood that if shit hits the fan, you need to be prepared and know what you are doing,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent, requesting not to print his surname due to fears that invading Russian forces would exact revenge on those known to have signed up to resist. Aivaras believes war in Lithuania is likely in the next two to five years &#x2014; potentially sooner, given Trump&#x2019;s actions. &quot;I think that we are a little bit too relaxed. We are not prepared,&quot; he said. &quot;We do not know what&#x2019;s coming for us, and we are very dependent, and we think that somebody else will come and save us.&quot; But for those with families, or those unable to sign up for the military or civil defense roles, more pressing questions with less clear answers are front and center. In Ukraine, Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion prompted a wave of refugees to head west away from the fighting but Lithuania &#x2014; only slightly larger than the U.S. state of West Virginia, this isn&apos;t a viable option, prompting many to plan where in the country would be the safest place to be. Zalieckas has already discussed evacuation plans with his family but his mother&apos;s job as a Supreme Court judge, and his grandparents&apos; health issues mean it&apos;s unlikely that they&apos;ll be able to leave the country. His grandparents live in Radviliskis, an &quot;insanely militarized&quot; area close to a NATO airbase &quot;There&apos;s a dual discussion,&quot; he says. &quot;Is it the least safe place to be or the most safe? Obviously if somebody bombs, they will bomb that place, but there are also air defense systems there.&quot; Stasiukyne, the 32-year-old fintech professional, and her husband, Arvydas, have packed a few emergency bags with basic necessities and supplies for their two young children in case they have to flee. They&apos;ve been informed by special guides on what to do in case of an emergency that were updated and reprinted after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

(Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images)But beyond packing grab bags and cutting back on expenditures so they have some emergency cash on hand, planning for a potential war with no definitive timeline or idea of what it could look like is tricky. &quot;You&#x2019;re never going to feel ready, because you don&#x2019;t know exactly what you&#x2019;re trying to be ready for,&quot; Stasiukyne said. Sikorskyit&#x117;, the 23-year-old English and French language teacher, studied in Kyiv just before the full-scale invasion and has visited friends in Ukraine several times during the war.&#x491; She said her experience of spending nights in bomb shelters and speaking to Ukrainians means she is better prepared for what might happen. &quot;A lot of Ukrainians are saying they weren&apos;t prepared at all. We are trying to learn from people&apos;s mistakes,&quot; she said. &#x201C;Let&apos;s hope for the best and be ready for the worst.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/talk-about-an-invasion-is-everywhere-how-lithuania-is-preparing-for-war-with-russia/	2025-03-17T12:14:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2155056954.jpg
Ukraine's Supreme Court rules illegal mobilization not grounds for dismissal from military	The conscription of a person liable for military service during mobilization is irreversible, Ukraine&apos;s Supreme Court ruled on March 17, following a lawsuit by a serviceman who claimed he had been drafted illegally. The man claimed that the enlistment office&apos;s actions were unlawful because he had not undergone a medical examination before going to the military unit. According to the man, he was allegedly unfit for service. According to Ukrainian law, a conscript must undergo a medical examination before joining the army to determine whether they are fit for military service. The court of first instance found the actions of the enlistment office workers during conscription unlawful and ordered the military unit to discharge the conscript from service. The Appeal Court upheld the decision. However, the Supreme Court ruled that the military unit could not discharge the person liable for military service, as this went beyond the scope of the claim regarding the actions of the enlistment office during the conscription. According to the Supreme Court, the procedure for calling a person liable for military service during mobilization is irreversible. Recognition of the procedure of conscription as unlawful does not entail the restoration of the person&apos;s previous position. According to the statement, the claimant also violated Article 26 of the Ukrainian Law &quot;On Military Duty and Military Service&quot; by failing to undergo a medical examination There have been multiple cases of suspected abuses committed by enlistment officials toward civilians and conscripts since Ukraine started a large-scale mobilization after the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022. Chernivtsi Oblast&apos;s police said on Feb. 7 that they are investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of a 32-year-old man at a regional military enlistment office. The incident follows reports on the deaths of conscripts allegedly caused by beatings at military enlistment offices. In June 2024, the Zhytomyr Oblast military enlistment office launched an investigation after Serhii Kovalchuk, 32, died following his stay at the Zviahel military enlistment office.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-supreme-court-rules-out-illegal-mobilization-isnt-ground-for-dismissal-from-ukrainian-armed-forces/	2025-03-17T11:50:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2163645053.jpg
Who is to gain more from a ceasefire — Russia or Ukraine?	U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 17 that he expects to hold a phone call with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to discuss a U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal that Moscow has yet to agree to. Russia has declined to immediately accept the 30-day ceasefire proposal, with the Kremlin pointing out that Ukraine stands to benefit more from the halt in military action. Putin demanded that Kyiv first halt mobilization, military training, and foreign aid deliveries before Russia would consider halting military action. According to experts, a month-long ceasefire would benefit both sides, allowing the warring parties to replenish and regroup their forces. The battlefield situation, however, is developing worse for Ukraine than for Russia. Following Ukrainian troops&apos; withdrawal from the town of Sudzha in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, experts who spoke with the Kyiv Independent said that Kyiv had a greater need for a pause in military action. &quot;Russia can regroup as well, but because Ukraine&apos;s problems are so much centered on questions of manpower and Russia has more blood to spare, I think it is more urgent for Ukraine to replenish some understaffed front-line brigades and therefore, the ceasefire could benefit them more,&quot; Sascha Bruchmann, a military analyst at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the Kyiv Independent. Kyiv could also get a respite from Moscow&apos;s missile and drone attacks, which have been more devastating than Ukrainian retaliatory strikes deep inside Russia. Following talks in Jeddah on March 11, Kyiv said it had agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington, provided that Russia did as well. On March 13, Putin said Russia was ready to agree to the U.S.-proposed ceasefire with Ukraine but then followed up with a list of demands that Kyiv and Washington must accommodate in order for Moscow to proceed with peace talks. The topic of a potential ceasefire is first on the list of the upcoming Trump-Putin phone call scheduled for March 18. Meanwhile, both Ukraine and Russia have experienced problems with manpower and equipment. Russia has been on the offensive in Donetsk Oblast since 2023, with its advance bogging down over the past month and Ukrainian troops even making gains near the towns of Toretsk and Pokrovsk. Ukraine, however, has faced setbacks in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, losing the key town of Sudzha and withdrawing closer to the border. Peter Layton, a military expert at the Royal United Services Institute, said that &quot;both sides would try to rearm during a ceasefire and rush supplies forward to the front line.&quot; Federico Borsari, a defense expert at the Center for European Policy Analysis, also argued that &quot;the ceasefire would be beneficial for both sides, given the issues and problems both Ukrainian and Russian forces face.&quot; However, Ukraine would still gain a bit more from a potential ceasefire. Borsari said that a ceasefire &quot;will allow much-needed (Ukrainian) unit rotations in key sectors of the front line (Sumy-Kursk, Lyman, etc), train new forces, strengthen defenses, and resupply units along the front lines.&quot; Ukrainian military vehicles driving past the border crossing point into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast from neighboring Sumy Oblast, Ukraine on Aug. 13, 2024. (Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)&quot;Ukraine was suffering from Russia&apos;s manpower advantages, especially in Kursk (Oblast), and as the two sides seem to be on a relative technological parity in the use of tactical drones, a ceasefire gives Ukraine time to carefully assess the situation on the front line, establish more anti-drone countermeasures, and train new forces,&quot; he added. &quot;Russia was advancing in Kursk (Oblast), so a ceasefire may be detrimental to any potential attempt to advance in (bordering) Sumy (Oblast) by exploiting Ukrainian vulnerabilities in that localized area.&quot; Meanwhile, Bruchmann said that &quot;there is an overriding political imperative, so the ceasefire approval in principle is good for Ukraine as it reinvigorates the U.S.-Ukraine weapons and intelligence partnership.&quot; &quot;Everything else pales in comparison,&quot; he added. But in some areas of the front a ceasefire could favor Russia more than Ukraine at the moment. &quot;In recent days, Ukrainian forces have managed to regain sizeable chunks of territory near Toretsk while also stopping Russian advances southwest of Pokrovsk,&quot; Borsari argued. &quot;Russian forces in these areas were becoming overstretched and lacked sufficient mechanized support to continue their assaults. A ceasefire, therefore, would be more beneficial for Russia in this specific sector.&quot; Meanwhile, Ukraine would clearly benefit from a halt in Russia&apos;s air assaults and bombardments, analysts say. Russia has been attacking Ukraine&apos;s entire territory with drones and missiles on a daily basis. As a result, a large part of Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed. Ukraine has retaliated, striking deep into Russia with drones of its own making and attacking border regions with foreign-provided missiles. Although Ukraine has caused damage to refineries, ammunition depots, and troops, the impact has been less devastating than that of Russian attacks on Ukraine. The foreign-provided missiles are also running out. &quot;While Ukraine&apos;s long-range strike campaign against Russian bases and infrastructure has had some significant effects, especially in forcing Russian forces to distribute their assets in less efficient ways, it is undeniable that the impact of Russia&apos;s long-range strike campaign on Ukrainian society, industry, and the military has been greater,&quot; Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute, told the Kyiv Independent.

(Vlada Liberova/Libkos/Getty Images)&quot;This is due to the far greater strike weight, especially in terms of heavier cruise and ballistic missiles, that Russian forces can generate. Therefore, any ceasefire agreement covering long-range strikes and aerial glide bomb attacks would almost certainly be more advantageous for Ukraine than for Russia &#x2014; assuming all other factors remain equal.&quot; Borsari argued that &quot;Ukraine would be able to significantly replenish its air-defense interceptors stocks and repair critical energy infrastructure, though Russia can also restock its missile arsenal for newer attacks.&quot; Erik Stijnman, a military expert at the Netherlands Institute of International Relations (Clingendael), said that &quot;both air forces do not have air superiority, let alone air supremacy over the contested battlespace.&quot; &quot;Removing the glide bomb out of the equation will probably benefit the Ukrainians a bit more,&quot; he added. &quot;Although enforcing a ceasefire for air assets should be achievable, restricting or enforcing the use of drones is very difficult, as it is to attribute the use of drones to one of the parties.&quot; However, Russia could also need a respite from Ukrainian drone attacks. &quot;What Ukraine&apos;s strike campaign has done is to significantly drive up the costs of aggression for Russia,&quot; Fabian Hoffman, a defense policy expert at the Oslo Nuclear Project, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The effectiveness of the strike campaigns has varied on both sides, so has their impact. At times, Ukraine&apos;s campaign was likely more effective, while at other times Russia&apos;s was.&quot; In the Black Sea, meanwhile, the ceasefire would give Russia some breathing room. Ukraine has successfully targeted Russian warships with drones and missiles, pushing them out of large parts of the Black Sea. One of Ukraine&apos;s most spectacular successes was the sinking of Russia&apos;s flagship cruiser Moskva in 2022. Ukraine&apos;s victories have allowed it to launch a corridor in the Black Sea in 2023 to ship its grain and other agricultural products. Bruchmann said that &quot;on the seas, (a ceasefire) might favor Russia slightly.&quot; &quot;I think the Russians failed to seize the initiative in the Black Sea for some time,&quot; he said. &quot;Their navy is boxed in and did not find a solution against Ukrainian unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), which seem to have become more lethal and versatile.&quot; Meanwhile, Borsari said that &quot;overall, the ceasefire would not bring any significant change in the Black Sea.&quot; &quot;In the Black Sea, we have seen a progressive decrease in Ukrainian attacks against Russian naval assets due to Russia&apos;s adaptation and decision to move most of its assets further away and outside the reach of Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missiles,&quot; he added. &quot;Ukraine has used USVs and motherships with first-person view drones (FPVs) to destroy a few valuable air-defense systems.&quot; Stijnman said that &quot;looking at operational advantages, a ceasefire on the sea will probably be the easiest to enforce, allowing the unhindered use of sealines of communications.&quot; A Ukrainian Maritime Guard inspection group prepares to board a cargo ship in the northwestern Black Sea on Dec. 18, 2023, amid the Russian invasion. (Anatolii Stepanov/AFP via Getty Images)&quot;This would benefit both parties, but probably Ukraine more, as it has access to one route,&quot; he added. The prospects for a ceasefire at sea, in the air, and on land remain unclear, but both Ukraine and Russia could see it as an opportunity. &quot;Both parties will need to prepare for the next phase, whatever it will be,&quot; Stijnman said. &quot;The advent of ceasefire negotiations, ceasefires, and peace negotiations will create a window of opportunity to (re)gain a more advantageous position over the other (side), either in a defensive, offensive, or stabilizing operation framework.&quot; &quot;The difficulty with any ceasefire, however, is that all parties are unsure to what extent the other party will commit to the agreements made,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/is-a-potential-ceasefire-more-beneficial-for-russia-or-ukraine/	2025-03-17T11:29:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202285720.jpg
EU plan to send over $40 billion in military aid has 'broad political support,' Kallas says	The initiative to provide Ukraine with 40 billion euros ($43.6 billion) in military aid has &quot;broad political support&quot; among EU member states, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said on March 17 before the Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in Brussels. EU diplomats reportedly suggested doubling military aid for Ukraine as the Trump administration&apos;s steps cast doubt on its commitment to Kyiv&apos;s security. Some member states have reacted cautiously to the initiative, according to Reuters. Kallas refuted these claims, saying there is &quot;a broad political support,&quot; but &quot;a lot of details need to be worked out.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s important that the &#x421;ouncil said that we need to move swiftly, and that is what we are doing,&quot; Kallas said. The EU foreign policy chief also added that the initiative will be discussed during a separate meeting involving EU defense ministers, which is scheduled on April 2-3 in Warsaw, Poland. Hungary&apos;s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto previously denounced EU plans to provide Ukraine with additional aid. &quot;We won&apos;t be dragged into this; we will not allow Hungarian taxpayers&apos; money to be used to finance arms shipments to Ukraine,&quot; Szijjarto said, insisting instead that Budapest supports peace negotiations. Hungary&apos;s leader, Viktor Orban, has consistently obstructed and delayed sanctions against Russia and military support for Kyiv. He has also lauded U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s reelection, expressing expectations of a quick end to the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/theres-broad-political-support-kallas-on-eu-plan-to-provide-over-40-billion-in-military-aid-to-ukraine/	2025-03-17T11:01:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/DSC07680.jpg
Russia claims capture of Stepove in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine denies	The Russian Defense Ministry claimed Russian forces captured the Ukrainian village of Stepove in Zaporizhzhia Oblast on March 17. Ukraine&apos;s Southern Defense Forces spokesperson Vladyslav Voloshyn denied the statement. Stepove, with a pre-war population of 118 people, is located 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the villages of Pyatykhatky and Mali Shcherbaky in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. All three settlements were under Russian occupation in 2022 and 2023. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that its military had taken control of Stepove. However, Voloshyn told the Kyiv Independent that Ukrainian forces did not lose ground in the Zaporizhzhia sector of the front line. The DeepState monitoring group map, as of March 17, 2025, in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)&quot;This is a method of information warfare &#x2014; the enemy claims that it is there before it has entered. I do not confirm the information that Russia entered the settlements of Stepove, Mali Shcherbaky, or Shcherbaky and took them under control,&quot; Voloshyn said. &quot;Fierce fighting continues in this area. The enemy is trying to change the configuration of the combat line in its favor. In total, six combat engagements were registered in the Orikhiv sector over the last day. The day before yesterday, there were 19,&quot; Voloshyn added. According to Voloshyn, since March, Russian forces have intensified their assaults in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Since the beginning of spring, there have been over 130 clashes in the Orikhiv sector alone. The Ukrainian military warned in fall 2024 that Russian forces were ammassing in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in preparation for a southern offensive. Heavy fortifications were constructed around the regional capital of Zaporizhzhia ahead of the possible invasion. The area near Stepove was the main axis of Ukraine&apos;s southern counteroffensive in 2023, which led to the liberation of the settlement of Robotyne but achieved no major breakthrough.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-to-capture-stepove-in-zaporizhzhia-oblast-ukraine-denies/	2025-03-17T09:31:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1706074000.jpg
EU foreign ministers to discuss US withdrawal of funding for RFE/RL	EU foreign ministers are set to discuss the termination of the U.S. grant that funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) during a meeting in Brussels on March 17, according to a Kyiv Independent reporter in Brussels. The news follows U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s executive order on March 14 to eliminate seven federal agencies, including the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees RFE/RL and Voice of America (VoA). As a result of Trump&#x2019;s decision, the congressionally authorized grant that funded RFE/RL has been terminated. Before the ministerial meeting in Brussels, Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky emphasized the importance of RFE/RL and VoA&apos;s work, calling them a &quot;beacon&quot; for people living in countries under authoritarianism. &quot;Do we see value in such an organization, broadcasting to countries like Russia, Belarus, Iran, and many others? And if we see such value, what are we willing to do to keep such a service in our favor?&quot; Lipavsky said, adding that the Czech Republic has hosted Radio Liberty&apos;s headquarters in Prague for almost three decades. Czech officials also circulated among their EU colleagues a draft statement seen by RFE/RL expressing grave concerns about the situation with RFE/RL&apos;s funding. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski confirmed that the EU is considering options to help the media after the U.S. funding cutoff, according to a Kyiv Independent reporter in Brussels. &quot;We are at the stage of brainstorming, but clearly, these are worthy institutions whose mission should continue,&quot; Sikorski said. Trump has long criticized U.S.-funded media organizations, criticizing them over their coverage of the U.S. president, and often referring to them as &quot;fake news.&quot; The Trump administration has previously cut thousands of federally-funded positions, with the cuts directly impacting support for Ukraine. In February, the Trump administration terminated the employment of top officials from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) after they attempted to prevent representatives from Elon Musk&apos;s DOGE from accessing restricted areas.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-to-discuss-us-governments-withdrawal-of-funding-for-rfe-rl/	2025-03-17T08:04:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/lipavsky.jpg
Germany's military rebirth is Europe’s best bet against Putin	When Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, he knew that he was upending Europe&#x2019;s security order. But this was more of a tactical gambit than a calculated strategy, and he could not have predicted what would follow. Though U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s return to the White House has caught Europe flat-footed, it can still keep Putin from walking away a winner. For now, Putin seems to hold all the cards. The transatlantic relationship is fracturing, as Trump&#x2019;s isolationist administration criticizes its European allies and casts doubt on his commitment to NATO. Worse, Trump appears to be aligning the United States with Russia in the Ukraine war. While he has threatened to impose new sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and peace deal are reached, he has blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for the fighting and suspended military aid and intelligence. But Europe still has a chance to turn things around. Already, it is abandoning its post-Cold War &#x201C;end of history&#x201D; mindset, according to which international law reigned supreme, European militaries were for keeping peace, not fighting wars, and the U.S. could be counted on to safeguard Europe&#x2019;s security. Finland and Sweden were perhaps the first to realize that &#x201C;history is back,&#x201D; and their accession to NATO &#x2014; in 2023 and 2024, respectively &#x2014; provided a major boost to the Alliance&#x2019;s northern flank. Now the European Union also appears to be coming to terms with its new security situation, having just announced an $840 billion rearmament plan. Even Germany, for which the return of history is particularly fraught, is preparing to rearm: incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz and his likely coalition partners have agreed to create a 500 billion euro ($544 billion) infrastructure fund and loosen fiscal rules to allow for greater investment in defense. The significance of this move should not be underestimated. Since the end of World War II, Germany has eschewed hard power in favor of the soft kind, serving as an engine of European integration and a bulwark of the rules-based world order. Beginning in the 1960s, this included the pursuit of &#x201C;constructive engagement&#x201D; &#x2014; a foreign-policy approach known as Ostpolitik &#x2014; with the Soviet Union and then Russia. This explains former Chancellor Angela Merkel&#x2019;s embrace of Russian energy supplies, despite the objections of other EU members and the U.S. Then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel (L) greets Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) at a summit on Libya at the German Chancellery in Berlin, Germany, on Jan. 19, 2020. (Adam Berry/Getty Images)Putin&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine drove a stake through the heart of Ostpolitik. Within days, Merkel&#x2019;s successor, Olaf Scholz, announced an &#x201C;epochal change&#x201D; (&quot;Zeitenwende&quot;) in Germany&#x2019;s defense and foreign policy. But it is Merz who is set to oversee a true break from Germany&#x2019;s postwar past &#x2014; a change that will require the country to confront the most daunting, destructive ghosts of its history. For starters, there is the fiscal revolution. Germany&#x2019;s frugality has been a source of considerable tension in the EU, particularly during the eurozone debt crisis of the early 2010s. But Germans &#x2014; not least Merkel &#x2014; recalled all too well how hyperinflation had paved the way for the rise of Adolf Hitler, and in 2009 Merkel&#x2019;s first government introduced a constitutional restriction on structural budget deficits to 0.35% of GDP annually, also known as the &#x201C;debt brake&#x201D; (&quot;Schuldenbremse&quot;). Against this backdrop, Merz&#x2019;s planned overhaul of borrowing rules &#x2014; including the modification and possible elimination of the debt brake &#x2014; represents a radical change in Germany&#x2019;s priorities. More broadly, Merz appears prepared to embrace European leadership. Despite being the EU&#x2019;s largest economy, Germany has long been reluctant to assume a genuine leadership role in Europe, particularly in the security domain. The combination of Russian revanchism and U.S. isolationism, however, has made this stance untenable. As Europe&#x2019;s most populous country, situated in the continent&#x2019;s &#x201C;geostrategic center,&#x201D; Merz says, Germany must &#x201C;take greater responsibility for leadership&#x201D; on defense. To avoid a repeat of the Munich Agreement of 1938 &#x2014; when France and Britain forced Czechoslovakia to cede territory to Hitler, setting the stage for World War II &#x2014; Europe must step up quickly to improve Ukraine&#x2019;s position on the battlefield and, thus, at the negotiating table. Fortunately, substituting lost U.S. financial aid will not be as difficult as Trump would have us believe: to date, Europe has provided far more support for Ukraine&#x2019;s war effort in dollar terms than the U.S. has. Fulfilling the weapons gap would, however, be far more challenging and probably impossible in the all-important short term. Once a peace agreement is reached, Europe will have to act as its guarantor &#x2014; and that means delivering effective deterrence against Russian aggression. A credible nuclear umbrella is essential. That is why Merz has suggested replacing U.S. nuclear warheads in Europe with French and British alternatives. There is even talk of Germany becoming a nuclear power itself. When NATO intervened in the Kosovo War in 1999, Germany&#x2019;s then-chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, ruled that sending ground troops to fight in a country that had once been occupied by Hitler&#x2019;s &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; was &#x201C;unthinkable.&#x201D; Today, as Merz seems to recognize, the unthinkable has become necessary. Only if Germany &#x2014; and Europe as a whole &#x2014; puts aside its moral and political inhibitions can it continue to perform its most important role: as a global force for peace and a defender of democratic principles.

Lithuania suspects Russia behind arson attacks in Vilnius and Warsaw last year	Lithuanian authorities suspect Russia&apos;s intelligence services of orchestrating arson attacks on an IKEA warehouse in Vilnius and a shopping center in Warsaw in 2024, the LRT broadcaster reported on March 17. A fire broke out at the IKEA warehouse in Vilnius on May 9, 2024, causing an estimated 500,000 euros ($545,000) in damages. Investigators consider the incident a terrorist act and claim two Ukrainian citizens, allegedly recruited by Russian security services, were responsible. One suspect is a minor. Saulius Briginas, deputy head of the Lithuanian Criminal Bureau, said the fire could have destroyed the entire shopping center if not for the quick response of staff and firefighters. On May 12, 2024, a massive fire destroyed a shopping center in Warsaw with 1,400 stores. The incident has also been linked to Russian intelligence services. Arson attacks have also targeted other EU countries, raising suspicions of a coordinated Russian effort to destabilize the countries that support Ukraine against Russian aggression. The Lithuanian prosecutor&apos;s office alleges that Russia&apos;s military intelligence (GRU) formed a special group to carry out arson attacks across Lithuania, Poland, and Latvia. Polish authorities are jointly investigating, with one suspect detained in Poland. &quot;Dear allies, the Lithuanian prosecutor&apos;s investigation confirmed our suspicions that Russian secret services were behind the fires in Vilnius and Warsaw,&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk posted on X. &quot;Good to know before negotiations. Such is the nature of this state,&quot; he added, alluding to expected peace talks that the Trump administration seeks to broker between Kyiv and Moscow. Tensions between NATO and Russia have risen following Moscow&apos;s all-out attack against Ukraine. Western leaders and intelligence agencies have warned of a potential large-scale war in Europe within the next five years, citing Russia&apos;s increasingly aggressive posture. Moscow has denied involvement or refrained from commenting on the sabotage incidents.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-suspects-russias-military-intelligence-behind-arson-attacks/	2025-03-17T07:25:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2152042801.jpg
Seoul, Kyiv discuss transfer of North Korean POWs to South Korea	Ukraine is negotiating with South Korea to hand over two North Korean soldiers taken prisoner by Kyiv, South Korea&apos;s Yonhap news agency reported on March 17. South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and his Ukrainian counterpart Andrii Sybiha discussed the potential transfer of the North Korean prisoners of war (POWs) in a phone call. Cho noted that under South Korea&apos;s Constitution, North Koreans are considered South Korean citizens, but the prisoners must express a desire to relocate. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast last fall to counter Ukraine&apos;s cross-border incursion launched in August 2024. Ukrainian troops captured two North Korean soldiers as POWs on Jan. 11. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously reported that North Korean forces fighting for Russia had suffered 4,000 casualties, with two-thirds of the losses being soldiers killed. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, attributed the high losses to North Korea&apos;s lack of combat experience and its use of human wave attacks with limited equipment.	https://kyivindependent.com/south-korea-ukraine-discuss-transfer-of-north-korean-pows/	2025-03-17T06:36:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2192716379.jpg
Anna Maksymenko wins Ukraine's first Grand Prix fencing gold since 2020	Ukrainian fencer Anna Maksymenko, 17, secured her first career gold medal at the Budapest Epee Grand Prix on March 16. This marks Ukraine&apos;s first Grand Prix victory in fencing since 2020 when Olha Kharlan won gold in saber in Montreal. It is also the first gold in epee competitions since 2013. Maksymenko defeated Canada&apos;s Leonora MacKinnon 15:9 in the semifinals, setting up a final match against Italy&apos;s Giulia Rizzi, a Paris 2024 Olympic team champion. The final was tightly contested, with Maksymenko trailing 9:11 in the last period. However, she equalized with 30 seconds left and then executed a decisive counterattack to win 12:11. The victory marks Maksymenko&apos;s first individual Grand Prix medal, adding to her previous silver in a team event at the World Cup level. On March 9, Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh claimed the gold medal at the European Athletics Indoor Championships in Apeldoorn, Netherlands.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-fencer-anna-maksymenko-wins-first-career-gold-at-budapest-epee-grand-prix/	2025-03-17T06:02:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/480967641_1271575851193556_3934336492471747526_n-2.jpg
Vucic vows to 'protect' Serbia from repeat of Ukraine's EuroMaidan	Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on March 16 drew comparisons between the ongoing anti-government protests in Serbia and Ukraine&apos;s 2014 EuroMaidan Revolution, vowing to &quot;protect and defend&quot; the country from such an event. His comments followed a massive rally in Belgrade on March 15, culminating months of near-daily protests against corruption and misgovernance, posing the most significant challenge to Vucic&apos;s 13-year rule. Vucic accused protest organizers of spreading misinformation, including claims that authorities had shut down the internet and used sonic cannons against demonstrators. &quot;Then they came up with a story about a sonic cannon... but the army does not have such weapons,&quot; Vucic said in a video address published on social media, insisting that what was shown was an anti-drone rifle, not a crowd-control device. Vucic compared the accusations to those made against ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych during the EuroMaidan protests, which saw over 100 demonstrators killed before Yanukovych fled to Russia in 2014. &quot;That&apos;s how they started talking here: &apos;Vucic, you shot at your own people,&apos;&quot; the Serbian president said. &quot;There were no wounded; nothing happened to anyone, but they have to come up with something.&quot; The protests erupted in November following the deadly collapse of a newly reconstructed train station roof in Novi Sad, which killed 15 people. The reconstruction, financed with Chinese and state funds, was widely viewed as corrupt. Student-led demonstrations quickly grew into broader anti-government protests, demanding accountability and an end to corruption. Vucic, who maintains close ties with Moscow, has frequently used Kremlin-style rhetoric to discredit protests. The Serbian opposition, along with student activists, has accused authorities of deploying a sound cannon against demonstrators during a silent vigil for the Novi Sad victims, with footage of people fleeing after a loud blast circulating on social media. The Serbian president vowed an investigation into what he called &quot;brutal fabrications and lies&quot; and warned that those responsible would be prosecuted.	https://kyivindependent.com/serbias-vucic-vows-to-protect-and-defend-country-from-euromaidan-like-protests/	2025-03-17T05:45:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204766554--1-.jpg
Germany delivers Gepard air defenses, shells, drones, other aid to Ukraine	Germany has provided three Gepard anti-aircraft systems with 10,000 rounds of ammunition, 24 mine protection vehicles, and other defense aid to Ukraine in its latest round of aid deliveries announced on March 17. Berlin is Ukraine&apos;s largest military donor in Europe, second only to the U.S. in terms of defense assistance provided. The new delivery included 5,000 155 mm artillery shells, 2,000 122 mm shells, 8,000 120 mm mortar shells, and ammunition for Leopard 1 tanks, Marder infantry fighting vehicles, and IRIS-T air defense systems. Ukraine has also received fresh support in unmanned systems, including 50 Vector reconnaissance drones, 30 Gereon RCS tracked drones, and 30 drone detection systems. The latest tranche further included small arms, first aid kits, demining equipment, and border protection equipment. Germany initially allocated around 4 billion euros ($4.36 billion) in defense assistance to Ukraine in 2025. Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz held up an additional 3 billion euros ($3.27 billion) proposed by his coalition partners, but his incoming successor, Friedrich Merz, pledged to push the package through.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-delivers-gepard-air-defenses-shells-drones-other-aid-to-ukraine/	2025-03-17T05:27:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1242704312.jpg
Kyiv reportedly extraditing German suspected of rape who fought for Ukraine	Ukraine is extraditing a German citizen who fought in Ukraine&apos;s Defense Forces and is suspected of rape and other crimes, the BBC and Suspilne reported on March 17, citing sources in the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. Ben R. is suspected of rape in Germany and Ukraine and of possession and distribution of images of sexual violence, including with children, according to the BBC. The German citizen reportedly fought for Ukraine between 2022 and 2024. German prosecutors requested his extradition twice in late 2023, but Ukrainian authorities took the step only a year later, in December 2024. Ben R. was reportedly arrested in Sumy Oblast a month later and left Ukraine via the Polish border on March 17 to stand trial in Germany, the BBC reported. Ben. R reportedly appealed the decision twice, but both times with procedural violations, leading to the court rejecting the appeals. German prosecutors allegedly possess video evidence of Ben R. raping women, including two Ukrainians, one of whom is a minor. Both of them confirmed this during a pre-trial investigation by Ukrainian prosecutors, though the underage girl later withdrew her testimony. The suspected rape of a minor remains under investigation. Mehr als zwei Jahre lang hat sich Ben R. den deutschen Strafverfolgern in der Ukraine entzogen, nun wurde der fr&#xFC;here Bundeswehrsoldat in der Region Sumy festgenommen. Er soll nach Deutschland ausgeliefert werden.https://t.co/AfvBi9hfMq Ben R. officially served in the International Legion of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) but also carried out tasks for combat units of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the BBC reported after receiving confirmation from both agencies. According to the outlet&apos;s sources, Ben R. took part in the battle of Bakhmut. The International Legion is divided into two units, one under the military intelligence agency and the other under the Armed Forces. Citizens from over 50 countries have joined the unit since the start of the full-scale invasion, including military veterans from the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia, Europe, and beyond, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence said. Initially lauded as a PR success, it soon became marred by scandals and stories about misconduct. Prior to his service in Ukraine, Ben R. served in the German military but was banned from performing military service in March 2022 and officially discharged a year later following a probe by German military prosecutors, the German newspaper Spiegel reported. Foreigners with criminal records cannot serve in Ukraine&apos;s defense forces. Last year, Ukraine extradited Craig Lang, a U.S. citizen who fought for Ukraine but was wanted in his homeland on murder, robbery, and other charges.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-reportedly-extradite-german-suspected-of-rape/	2025-03-17T05:01:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1738887156.jpg
Rubio asked Hungary not to block EU sanctions, Politico reports	Hungary has dropped its threat to block the extension of EU sanctions against Russia following a conversation between Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Politico reported on March 17, citing undisclosed sources. In January, Budapest said it plans to veto the sanctions renewal, citing U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s return to the White House and the possibility of a shift in U.S. policy toward Russia. Since then, Trump has warned Russia of additional sanctions and trade measures unless it agrees to peace talks in Ukraine. According to two Politico sources, Rubio urged Szijjarto to refrain from undermining the EU sanctions system, contributing to Budapest&apos;s decision to support the measures. The outlet nevertheless notes that Trump could alter his approach at any time by offering to ease sanctions as part of negotiations with Russia. If that happens, the EU could lose leverage over Hungary, which has repeatedly used its veto power to extract concessions from Brussels. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, widely considered the EU&apos;s most Russian-friendly leader, has consistently opposed military aid for Ukraine and warned that Ukraine&apos;s EU accession would &quot;destroy&quot; Hungary. Orban has maintained close ties with Russia despite its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The EU&apos;s sanctions framework includes economic measures and restrictions on over 2,400 individuals and entities linked to Russia. Since sanctions must be extended unanimously, a Hungarian veto could force the EU to negotiate new compromises or risk a lapse in enforcement.	https://kyivindependent.com/budapest-backs-down-on-eu-sanctions-veto-following-szijjarto-rubio-conversation-politico-reports/	2025-03-17T04:11:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202699955.jpg
EU approves third $3.8 billion tranche for Kyiv under Ukraine Facility program	Ukraine will receive 3.5 billion euros ($3.8 billion) after the Council of the EU approved the third installment of non-refundable grants and loans under the Ukraine Facility program, the Council announced on March 17. With this disbursement, Ukraine will have received nearly 20 billion euros ($21.7 billion) under the Ukraine Facility since the program was launched in early 2024. &quot;The Council concluded today that Ukraine had satisfied the necessary conditions laid down in the Ukraine Plan in order to receive a third disbursement from the Ukraine Facility,&quot; the statement reads. The Ukraine Plan outlines Kyiv&apos;s strategy for recovery, reconstruction, and modernization and a reform timetable as part of Ukraine&apos;s EU accession process over the next four years. To qualify for this funding, Ukraine implemented 13 key reforms, including measures to boost renewable energy, strengthen the independence of the energy regulator, and streamline border-crossing procedures in line with EU standards. The EU approved the four-year Ukraine Facility in February 2024, allocating 33 billion euros ($36 billion) in loans and 17 billion euros ($18 billion) in grants to support Ukraine&apos;s economy and reconstruction efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-approves-third-3-8-billion-tranche-for-kyiv-under-ukraine-facility-program/	2025-03-17T03:41:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/EUparl.jpg
Zelensky signs law permitting Ukrainian troops to operate abroad during martial law	President Volodymyr Zelensky has signed a law allowing Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces to be sent abroad during martial law, according to an official decree published on March 17. The law aims to enhance defense cooperation with partner nations, particularly by enabling Ukrainian forces to participate in training and receive military equipment, lawmaker Oleksii Honcharenko explained. &quot;This will allow us to attract international support to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s defense faster and more effectively,&quot; Honcharenko posted on Telegram. The legislation permits Ukrainian military units to be deployed to other countries for national security purposes, including repelling armed aggression, protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity, and exercising the right to self-defense under international law. The law does not concern the deployment of Ukrainian troops for combat operations on Russian territory. The decision to send military personnel abroad will be made by the president but requires approval from the Verkhovna Rada, the country&apos;s parliament. Deployments will be subject to a formal request detailing the mission&apos;s objectives, troop numbers, weaponry, and the conditions of their stay abroad. Zelensky vetoed the bill in January and returned it to parliament with amendments clarifying the decision-making process and ensuring compliance with international law. Lawmakers approved the revised version in late February.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-signs-law-permitting-ukrainian-troops-to-operate-abroad-during-martial-law/	2025-03-17T03:21:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/photo_2024-01-29_14-15-42.jpg
Territorial integrity, military size, alliances — FM Sybiha sets 3 'fundamentals' for potential peace talks	Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha outlined three key conditions for future negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine in an interview with RBC-Ukraine published on March 17. &quot;I don&apos;t like this definition (red lines). There are fundamental things that are non-negotiable, that cannot be touched upon,&quot; Sybiha said when asked what Ukraine&apos;s red lines are in potential talks. Sybiha stressed that Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity and sovereignty are non-negotiable, reaffirming that Kyiv will never recognize Russian-occupied territories as part of Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky voiced this stance back on March 12. Despite this, the Trump administration has suggested that Kyiv and Moscow must compromise on a peace deal, calling Ukraine&apos;s goal of restoring its pre-2014 borders &quot;unrealistic.&quot; Russian forces currently occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine, where reports of systematic repression, torture, and forced deportations continue to emerge. According to Sybiha, the second key condition is Ukraine&apos;s right to choose its alliances. He emphasized that no country should have a veto over Ukraine&apos;s NATO and EU aspirations. Kyiv officially applied to join NATO in September 2022, and in 2024, the alliance declared Ukraine&apos;s path to membership &quot;irreversible,&quot; though no formal invitation has been extended. Sybiha also underscored that Ukraine&apos;s ability to defend itself must remain unrestricted, meaning there can be no restrictions on the Ukrainian Armed Forces. &quot;Russia must be held accountable. These are all elements of a lasting peace,&quot; he said. On March 13, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was willing to accept a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire but demanded guarantees that Kyiv would halt mobilization, military training, and foreign aid deliveries &#x2014; conditions that could leave Ukraine vulnerable to renewed aggression. U.S. President Donald Trump is set to speak with Putin on March 18 to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. While Trump seeks to secure a deal, European allies and Ukraine warn that a rushed agreement without security guarantees may fail to ensure lasting peace.	https://kyivindependent.com/sybiha-on-negotiations/	2025-03-17T03:12:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170361277.jpg
Georgia sentences ex-President Saakashvili to additional 4.5 years over illegal border crossing	A court in Georgia has sentenced former President Mikheil Saakashvili to an additional four and a half years in prison on illegal border crossing charges, Georgian TV channel Mtavari reported on March 17. The latest ruling follows a nine-year sentence issued last week on large-scale state funds embezzlement charges, adding up to almost 12 additional years in prison for Saakashvili. The border crossing case concerns Saakashvili&apos;s secret return from Ukraine to Georgia on Sept. 29, 2021, despite being wanted by Georgian authorities. He was arrested on Oct. 1, 2021. Four others were charged in separate proceedings over Saakashvili&apos;s illegal entry and released on bail. Saakashvili, who served as Georgia&apos;s president from 2004-2007 and to 2008-2013, sought to align the country with the West but lost elections to the Moscow-friendly Georgian Dream party years after a defeat in the 2008 Russia-Georgia war. A longtime critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Saakashvili has accused billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, the honorary chairman of the Georgian Dream, of orchestrating his prosecution on Moscow&apos;s orders. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled last May that there were no grounds to believe that Saakashvili&apos;s criminal proceedings were unfair. Since Georgia follows the principle of sentence absorption, Saakashvili&apos;s earliest release date would be October 2030, considering his time in custody. Saakashvili, who holds Ukrainian citizenship and previously served as the governor of Odesa Oblast, has faced worsening health conditions during his custody. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in February 2023 that the &quot;Georgian government is killing&quot; Saakashvili after images surfaced showing his significant weight loss. The ruling follows mass protests in Tbilisi over Georgia&apos;s disputed October elections, which saw the Kremlin-friendly Georgian Dream party retain power. The crisis deepened after Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced that Georgia&apos;s EU integration could be delayed until 2028.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-court-sentences-ex-president-saakashvili-to-4-5-years-for-illegal-border-crossing/	2025-03-17T02:55:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1748648446.jpg
We won't be dragged into this' — Hungary opposes $22 billion EU aid package for Ukraine	Hungary&apos;s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on March 17 denounced EU plans to provide Ukraine with an additional 20 billion euros ($22 billion) in aid, a step allegedly on the agenda of a ministerial meeting in Brussels later the same day. &quot;We won&apos;t be dragged into this; we will not allow Hungarian taxpayers&apos; money to be used to finance arms shipments to Ukraine,&quot; Szijjarto said on Facebook, insisting instead that Budapest supports peace negotiations. European leaders have been calling for ramped-up support for Ukraine as the Trump administration&apos;s steps cast doubt on its commitment to Kyiv&apos;s security. U.S. President Donald Trump has been pushing for a swift peace settlement, temporarily cutting off military and intelligence backing for Ukraine to push it to the negotiating table. &quot;Thanks to President Trump, the hope of peace has never been closer in the past three years, which is why Brussels&apos;s intention to make peace negotiations impossible is unacceptable,&quot; Szijjarto said. &quot;In Brussels, the pro-war stance still prevails.&quot; Discussions about a possible 20-billion-euro package first emerged in February, but the assistance tranche was not included in the conclusions of an emergency EU summit on March 6. Hungary&apos;s leader, Viktor Orban, has consistently obstructed and delayed sanctions against Russia and military support for Kyiv. He has also lauded Trump&apos;s reelection, expressing expectations of a quick end to the war. While the EU recently managed to negotiate a unanimous extension of sanctions against Russia, European leaders grow increasingly concerned by Budapest&apos;s efforts to derail unity on Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-vows-to-oppose-22-billion-eu-aid-package-for-ukraine/	2025-03-17T02:43:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1258722653.jpg
Russia sanctions could be eased in exchange for security, justice for Ukraine, Ukrainian official says	Western sanctions against Russia could be eventually relaxed if the step ensures security and justice for Ukraine, top Ukrainian sanctions official Vladyslav Vlasiuk told Politico in an interview published on March 17. The U.S., the EU, and other international partners have imposed heavy sanctions against Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, aiming to undermine its ability to wage war. Vlasiuk said that easing the economic restrictions imposed on Russia is &quot;a matter of time,&quot; but stressed that it has to happen under the right conditions. He noted that sanctions are designed to push Russia to cease its aggression and commit to lasting peace rather than being a &quot;punishment of any kind.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened additional sanctions and tariffs on Russia while also temporarily cutting off military and intelligence support for Kyiv to push the two countries to peace talks. While saying it is premature to discuss what sanctions could be lifted, Vlasiuk added that Moscow is already asking to ease specific restrictions, indicating what hurts Russia the most. A lasting agreement with Russia would have to include justice and &quot;compensations for the Ukrainians&quot; for more than three years of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion, Vlasiuk noted. Western sanctions have primarily targeted Russia&apos;s energy sector, as oil and gas exports represent a major part of Moscow&apos;s war budget. The EU has sought to pivot away from Russian supplies, while the G7 imposed a trade cap on Russian seaborne crude oil. Over 460 international companies have exited Russia since February 2022, representing a loss of $6 billion in taxes paid to the Russian state, according to the Kyiv School of Economics. The Trump administration extended some of the sanctions but said that easing the restrictions would have to be part of an eventual peace deal. Last week, the U.S. did not extend an exemption allowing Russian banks to use U.S. payment systems for energy transactions, dealing another blow to Russia&apos;s oil industry.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-sanctions-could-be-eased-in-exchange-for-security-justice-for-ukraine-ukrainian-official-says/	2025-03-17T01:53:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1238830344.jpg
Russia open to civilian observers in Ukraine under possible peace deal	Russia is open to allowing unarmed observers and civilian missions in Ukraine as part of a potential peace deal, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said on March 16, according to state-owned news agency TASS. &quot;A peace treaty may provide for unarmed observers in Ukraine, a civilian mission to monitor the implementation of certain aspects of the agreement, or guarantee mechanisms,&quot; Grushko said. Kyiv has said that strong security guarantees are essential for any peace agreement. The deployment of international peacekeeping forces in Ukraine has been considered as one possible option. &quot;If we talk about a peaceful solution to the conflict in Ukraine, of course, it will have an external contour. We will demand that ironclad security guarantees be part of this agreement,&quot; Grushko said. The official reiterated that Russia sees Ukraine&apos;s &quot;neutrality&quot; and NATO non-membership as essential parts of any agreement. Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022. While the alliance declared in 2024 that Ukraine&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; no formal invitation has been extended. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 24 that Russian President Vladimir Putin would allow European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a deal, though Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has publicly rejected the idea. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer presented plans to send 10,000 peacekeeping troops to Ukraine during a high-level virtual summit in London on March 15, Sunday Times reported. French President Emmanuel Macron declared that Kyiv does not need Russia&apos;s approval to invite peacekeeping troops into its territory. Bloomberg reported on March 10 that Putin has set &quot;maximalist&quot; demands &#x2014; including territorial concessions, peacekeeper restrictions, and Ukraine&#x2019;s neutrality &#x2014; knowing they will likely be unacceptable to Kyiv and its Western allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-open-to-unarmed-observers-civilian-missions-in-ukraine-under-possible-peace-deal-deputy-fm-says/	2025-03-17T01:03:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203918696.jpg
3 killed, 12 injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least three civilians and injured at least 12 over the past day, regional authorities reported on March 17. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 90 of the 174 attack and decoy drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Seventy other decoy drones reportedly disappeared from radars without causing damage. Russian attacks in Donetsk Oblast killed one civilian in Myrnohrad and injured one in Siversk, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Five civilians were injured in Russian attacks against Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. An airstrike against the town of Kupiansk on March 16 reportedly injured a 57-year-old man and damaged 22 houses.

One civilian was killed and three injured during Russian strikes in Kherson Oblast, according to the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. An apartment building and five houses were damaged. A drone attack against the Odesa district in Odesa Oblast injured a woman, damaged a kindergarten, a house, a shop, and a car, according to Governor Oleh Kiper. Damage to the energy grid left around 500 consumers in Odesa&apos;s suburbs without power, according to the statement. Russian attacks against Sumy Oblast killed one civilian and injured two, the regional military administration reported. One person was killed, and an apartment building was damaged during a mortar attack against the Seredyna-Buda community. Two injuries were reported in the Bilopillia and the Myropillia communities.

Ukrainian drones attack fuel facility in Russia's Astrakhan Oblast, governor claims	Ukrainian drones attacked a fuel and energy facility in Russia&apos;s Astrakhan Oblast on March 17, causing a fire, regional governor Igor Babushkin claimed. &quot;Overnight, the Ukrainian Armed Forces again attempted a massive drone attack on facilities located in the region, including a fuel and energy complex,&quot; Babushkin claimed. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry said its forces had destroyed 13 drones over the oblast. Babushkin reported that fallen debris caused a fire at the facility, and one person was hospitalized. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. Astrakhan Oblast is located in southwestern Russia and borders Kazakhstan. The city of Astrakhan is almost 800 kilometers (500 miles) from the front line in Ukraine. Ukraine has increasingly targeted Russia&apos;s energy and military infrastructure to disrupt Moscow&apos;s war effort. Overnight on March 14, Ukrainian drones struck the Tuapse oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai, igniting a gasoline storage tank. Kyiv has focused on hitting Russian refineries, oil depots, and defense industry sites, aiming to limit Moscow&apos;s ability to sustain its full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-strike-fuel-facility-in-russias-astrakhan-oblast-causing-fire-governor-says/	2025-03-17T00:14:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/backfire.jpg
US to withdraw from group investigating Russian leadership for crimes against Ukraine, NYT reports	The U.S. has privately told European officials that it is pulling back from an international group investigating Russian leaders for the crime of aggression committed against Ukraine, the New York Times reported on March 17, citing undisclosed sources. The move underscores the foreign policy shift in Washington as the Trump administration seeks to restore ties with Moscow while pushing for a swift peace deal in Ukraine. The decision is expected to be announced on March 17 in an email to the group&apos;s parent organization, the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust), the New York Times wrote. The Hague-based International Center for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine is a judicial hub supporting national investigations into the crime of aggression committed by the Russian leadership, including President Vladimir Putin, and Moscow&apos;s allies against Ukraine. While the group is made up of specialists from Ukraine, Poland, Romania, and the Baltic countries, the Biden administration appointed a special prosecutor to support the hub&apos;s activities in 2023. The Trump administration will also reduce the work of the U.S. Justice Department&apos;s War Crimes Accountability Team, which was launched in 2022 to investigate Russia for the atrocities it had committed during the full-scale invasion. Ukraine is investigating more than 150,000 possible war crimes committed by Russia as part of its all-out war, including the summary execution of prisoners and targeted aerial strikes against civilians. U.S. President Donald Trump has sought to mend the ties with Moscow in an effort to bring a swift end to the war while adopting a more antagonistic stance toward Ukraine and other partners. The U.S. has briefly halted military and intelligence support for Kyiv while also cutting key foreign aid supporting programs aimed at the prosecution of Russian war crimes and the restoration of Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure. On the international scene, the U.S. has sought to water down joint statements labeling Russia as the aggressor and the &quot;sole obstacle&quot; to peace.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-withdraw-from-group-investigating-putin-for-crimes-against-ukraine-nyt-reports/	2025-03-16T23:47:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/justice.jpeg
Trump plans to call Putin on March 18 to discuss war in Ukraine	U.S. President Donald Trump said he plans to have a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 18 to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported. &quot;I&apos;ll be speaking to President Putin on Tuesday. A lot of work&apos;s been done over the weekend,&quot; Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on March 17. The planned call follows U.S.-led negotiations in Saudi Arabia, where Washington proposed a 30-day ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. Kyiv accepted the deal during talks in Jeddah on March 11, prompting the U.S. to resume military and intelligence support for Ukraine. On March 13, Putin said Russia was also willing to accept the ceasefire but demanded guarantees that Ukraine would not mobilize troops, conduct training, or receive military assistance during the truce, making it potentially vulnerable to renewed Russian aggression. To discuss the proposal, U.S. Special Representative Steve Witkoff traveled to Moscow, where Putin reportedly signaled openness to the U.S. plan. &quot;We want to see if we can bring that war to an end. Maybe we can, maybe we can&apos;t, but I think we have a very good chance,&quot; Trump said. When asked about potential concessions in the ceasefire talks, Trump said discussions would include territorial matters and power plants. &quot;I think we have a lot of it already discussed very much by both sides, Ukraine and Russia. We&apos;re already talking about that, dividing up certain assets,&quot; Trump added. The expected phone call comes as Trump pushes to secure a deal, though European allies and Ukraine warn that a rushed agreement without security guarantees could fail to bring lasting peace.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-plans-call-with-putin-on-march-18-to-discuss-war-in-ukraine/	2025-03-16T23:39:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204976741-2.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 895,450 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 895,450 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on March 17. The number includes 1,210 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,344 tanks, 21,489 armored fighting vehicles, 40,785 vehicles and fuel tanks, 24,598 artillery systems, 1,318 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,104 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 29,467 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-895-450-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-03-16T23:10:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2003914665.jpg
Ukraine ceasefire faces battlefield challenges, envoy says	Steve Witkoff, Trump&#x2019;s special envoy to the Middle East, emphasized the challenges of implementing a ceasefire in Ukraine, citing the vast scale of the war. Witkoff paid a visit to Moscow on March 13 for talks on the 30-day ceasefire proposal that Ukraine had accepted after a U.S.-Ukrainian meeting in Saudi Arabia on March 11. &quot;A ceasefire involves how to get people to not be fighting with each other over a 2,000-kilometer border,&quot; he said on CBS News &quot;Face the Nation&quot; on March 16, noting the complexity of managing hostilities across such a large area. Witkoff pointed to key battlegrounds, including Kursk, and stressed the need to address strategic concerns like control over Ukraine&#x2019;s nuclear power infrastructure and access to Black Sea ports. &quot;There is a nuclear reactor that supplies quite a bit of electricity to the country of Ukraine. That&#x2019;s got to be dealt with,&quot; he said referring to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, adding that Russian objectives in specific regions must also be considered in negotiations. Europe&#x2019;s largest nuclear facility, the Zaporizhzhia plant in Enerhodar, has been under Russian occupation since 2022. Although still controlled by Russian forces, the plant is not currently producing electricity. Ukraine and its allies have consistently called for Russia to withdraw its troops from the site. Since the occupation began, the plant has been repeatedly disconnected from Ukraine&#x2019;s power grid due to Russian attacks on the country&#x2019;s energy infrastructure. Comparing the situation to the conflict in Gaza, Witkoff noted the differences in scope. &quot;Gaza is a finite, defined space, as compared to where the battle is being fought in Ukraine, Russia. So this is a much more complicated situation,&quot; he said. Despite these challenges, he insisted that no one is &quot;throwing their hands up in the air&quot; and that all stakeholders, including European partners, remain committed to seeking a resolution.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-ceasefire-faces-battlefield-challenges-envoy-says/	2025-03-16T22:27:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1927135939.jpg
Lviv airport could reopen by late spring, general director says	Lviv&#x2019;s Danylo Halytskyi International Airport may resume aviation operations as early as April or May, according to an optimistic scenario under government consideration, its general director told Vysokyi Zamok media outlet on March 15. Other potential dates for reopening Ukraine&#x2019;s airspace include the summer months. Five to seven airlines have expressed readiness to begin operations in Lviv within a month of the terminal&#x2019;s reopening, Tetiana Romanovska, General Director of Lviv Danylo Halytskyi International Airport said, adding that it could serve as a strong symbol of solidarity with Ukraine. Additionally, the government is considering reopening another airport in western Ukraine&apos;s Uzhhorod, located directly on the border with Slovakia and in close proximity to the borders of Hungary and Poland, all of which are NATO member countries. Romanovska confirmed that airlines such as Wizz Air, Air Baltic, Turkish Airlines, SkyUp, Austrian Airlines, Lufthansa, and LOT are prepared to operate from Lviv once flights resume. &quot;Right now, we are talking about restoring regular flights from Lviv,&quot; Romanovska said. &quot;SkyUp will likely take the lead in bringing back charter flights, as they have a well-developed route network in Europe and are ready to resume the same routes from Lviv or another Ukrainian city.&quot; Airlines have already begun preparations. &quot;This year, airline representatives have reached out to us, conducted their audits, and are analyzing the situation. Wizz Air completed its audit last year,&quot; Romanovska explained. She added that once a decision to reopen airspace is made, airline teams could arrive and begin operations within three to four days. &quot;We hope the airport will reopen in the summer period because that&#x2019;s when aviation traffic is at its highest&#x2014;during vacations, long daylight hours, and peak travel season,&quot; Romanovska said. &quot;But if it happens in April or May, that would be an extremely positive development for us.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/lviv-airport-could-reopen-by-late-spring-general-director-says/	2025-03-16T21:15:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2123636893.jpg
Erdogan tells Trump that Turkey supports US efforts to end Russia's war	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo&#x11F;an on March 16 &#xA0;spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump for the first time since his second term began in January, with the conversation covering key issues, including Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. During the conversation, Erdogan expressed support for President Trump&apos;s efforts to bring an end to the war. He emphasized that Turkey backs Trump&#x2019;s initiatives aimed at resolving the war and voiced hope for a positive outcome under his leadership. Turkey has positioned itself as a potential mediator in Russia&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine, now in its fourth year, by maintaining diplomatic and economic ties with both nations while supporting Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty. Leveraging its strategic position and influence in the Black Sea region, Turkey has facilitated negotiations, grain exports, and expressed willingness to participate in ceasefire monitoring. In late February, Turkey indicated its openness to deploying troops in Ukraine as part of a potential peacekeeping force. Sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that Erdogan raised the issue in separate meetings with President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov during visits to Ankara earlier in February. While Moscow has openly opposed the presence of NATO troops in Ukraine, Russia has yet to provide a clear response to Turkey&apos;s proposal.	https://kyivindependent.com/erdogan-tells-trump-that-turkey-supports-us-efforts-to-end-russias-war-against-ukraine/	2025-03-16T21:12:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1239585119.jpg
Plan A is get the shooting to stop' — Rubio says as US pushes for ceasefire in Ukraine	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described a recent meeting between U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin as &quot;promising&quot; while acknowledging the complexities of ending the ongoing war. Speaking on CBS&#x2019;s &quot;Face the Nation&quot; on March 16, Rubio said the discussions provided insight into whether Russia is genuinely considering a ceasefire or merely stalling for time. Rubio outlined the U.S. administration&#x2019;s two-phase approach to ending Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, now in its fourth year. &quot;Plan A is, get the shooting to stop so that we can move to Plan B, phase two, which is have everybody at a table, maybe not- maybe with some shuttle diplomacy, to figure out a way to permanently end this war in a way that&apos;s enduring and it respects everybody&apos;s needs and so forth,&quot; he said. The secretary emphasized that the priority remains achieving a ceasefire before beginning broader negotiations for a permanent resolution. However, he acknowledged that even reaching a ceasefire would be difficult, given the complexity of the battlefield and the interests at stake. While Rubio refrained from disclosing details of the negotiations, he remained cautiously optimistic. He said that President Donald Trump is committed to bringing the war to an end and is actively working to ensure a cessation of hostilities. &quot;No one is saying that that second part is easy, but we can&apos;t get even to that second part until we get past the first part,&quot; he said, underlining the administration&#x2019;s strategy. The secretary also highlighted the need for diplomatic engagement and potential concessions from both sides to achieve a lasting peace. &quot;This war cannot continue. The president has been clear about that, and he&apos;s doing everything he can to bring it to an end,&quot; he concluded.	https://kyivindependent.com/plan-a-is-get-the-shooting-to-stop-rubio-says-as-us-pushes-for-ceasefire-in-ukraine/	2025-03-16T19:38:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194552772.jpg
Lithuania backs EU plan for $43.5 billion in military aid to Ukraine, Reuters reports	Lithuania has voiced support for an EU initiative to provide Ukraine with up to 40 billion euro ($43.5 billion) in military aid this year, arguing that similar funding will be necessary in the future to prevent another Russian attack. &quot;If we can sustain this amount ... for a longer period of time, that would be the amount that would allow Ukrainians to keep their armed forces at current strength,&quot; Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys told Reuters on March 16. Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022, Lithuania has been one of Ukraine&#x2019;s most vocal backers. The Baltic state ranks among Europe&apos;s top defense spenders, allocating 2.85% of GDP to defense in 2024, according to NATO estimates. Vilnius plans to increase that figure to between 5% and 6% from 2026 to 2030. EU foreign ministers are set to discuss the proposal in Brussels, with the plan introduced by the bloc&#x2019;s diplomatic service, led by former Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas. The talks come amid uncertainty over U.S. negotiations with Russia, the future of American military support for Ukraine, and Washington&#x2019;s broader security commitments to Europe. A document obtained by Reuters on March 14 revealed that EU diplomats have suggested doubling military aid for Ukraine to as much as $43.5 billion. Some member states have reacted cautiously, but Budrys stressed that long-term military support for Kyiv should not be tied to any potential peace talks. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s armed forces will be the main deterrence forces for Russians not to return,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-backs-eu-plan-for-43-5-billion-in-military-aid-to-ukraine-reuters-reports/	2025-03-16T17:58:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1520422838.jpg
Kremlin dismisses ceasefire as tactic to buy time for Ukraine’s military	The Kremlin claims that calls for a ceasefire in Ukraine are merely an attempt to give the Ukrainian military time to regroup and rearm, according to Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s aide, Yuri Ushakov. &quot;We see this as an effort to provide Ukrainian forces with a pause during a difficult period. The Russian army is advancing on all fronts, and under these circumstances, the ceasefire could be viewed as a way to allow Ukraine to strengthen its position,&quot; Ushakov told state-owned media on March 16. He added that Russia has conveyed its concerns to the United States and that while communication between the two countries continues, it does not extend to direct talks between the presidents. Ushakov also noted that a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin could be arranged quickly if necessary. During negotiations in Saudi Arabia, U.S. officials proposed a 30-day ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. Ukrainian representatives agreed to the idea, though President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had previously suggested limiting a ceasefire to air and water operations. To discuss the proposal, U.S. Special Representative Steve Witkoff traveled to Moscow. Following the visit, Putin reportedly signaled his willingness to accept the U.S. plan but insisted that any ceasefire must contribute to a long-term resolution of the war. Despite this, Ukraine remains doubtful that Russia would uphold a ceasefire agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-dismisses-ceasefire-as-tactic-to-buy-time-for-ukraines-military/	2025-03-16T15:51:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1252236776.jpg
Zelensky announces upcoming Ramstein summit in Brussels	Ukraine is preparing for the next Ramstein summit, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced in his evening address on March 16. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov is now in the process of organizing the next Ramstein-format Ukrainian Defense Contact Group (UDCG), Zelensky said. &quot;We are preparing for Brussels,&quot; he said. The last Ramstein-format UDCG meeting took place in Brussels on Feb. 12 under the chairmanship of the U.K. &#x2013; a position previously held by the U.S. Leadership over Ramstein transitioned following the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump. The meeting focused on coordinating support for Ukraine, including expanding defense production, financing new enterprises, and increasing arms supplies through European defense industry capacities. While specific dates have yet to be confirmed, the next Ramstein summit will likely take place in late March or early April. Zelensky also said that Ukraine is acquiring more ammunition, including artillery shells and additional missiles for its IRIS-T, NASAMS, and SAMP/T air defense systems.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-announces-next-ramstein-summit/	2025-03-16T14:27:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156503093.jpg
New Canadian PM discusses security guarantees, bilateral cooperation in call with Zelensky	Newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney discussed Canada&apos;s support for Ukraine in a phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Presidential Office reported on March 16. Carney was sworn in as Canada&apos;s prime minister on March 14, replacing former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as head of the governing Liberal Party. Trudeau announced his resignation in January. The leaders discussed increasing pressure on Moscow, particularly by imposing new sanctions against Russia&apos;s banking sector and its so-called &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of oil tankers. They also spoke about security guarantees for Ukraine, including Canada&apos;s commitment to providing economic support after the war ends. Carney and Zelensky also discussed defense cooperation and the possibility of joint production of long-range weapons and electronic warfare equipment. Canada recently participated in the &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; virtual summit convened by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer on March 15. Following the conference, Canada reiterated his support for Ukraine in a post on X. &quot;Canada supports the proposal for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine,&quot; Carney wrote. &quot;Now, Russia must stop stalling and launching its attacks. It&apos;s time for Russia to come to the table in good faith.&quot; Carney said his country remains &quot;Ukraine&apos;s steadfast ally&quot; and is committed to lending Kyiv &quot;the military support it needs to defend itself &#x2014; now and into the future.&quot; Under Trudeau&apos;s leadership, Canada was a strong ally of Ukraine, providing 19.5 billion Canadian dollars ($13.5 billion) in assistance, including 4.5 billion Canadian dollars ($3.1 billion) in military aid. Prior to the March 15 summit, Canada also signalled its willingness to partake in a potential peacekeeping mission in Ukraine. Carney, a former central banker, is widely expected to trigger a general election in the coming weeks. Canada is required to hold a general election no later than Oct. 20.	https://kyivindependent.com/new-canadian-pm-discusses-security-guarantees-in-call-with-zelensky/	2025-03-16T13:57:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204533696.jpg
No more lost territory, return of deported children — Kyiv names red lines for peace deal, Independent reports	Ukraine is ready to negotiate a peace deal with Russia, but remains firm on several key areas, the U.K. news outlet the Independent reported on March 16, citing senior Ukrainian officials. Kyiv has agreed to accept a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire, provided Russia also abides by its terms. U.S. officials are currently negotiating with Moscow on the details of the proposal. &quot;We are really willing to make peace, but we need a long-lasting peace, not a short ceasefire,&quot; a high-level Ukrainian source told the Independent, speaking on the condition of anonymity. &quot;We do not want our children fighting this battle.&quot; Ukraine has four key terms that must be upheld in order for the full-scale war to end, sources said. These are: Kyiv is prepared to accept a freeze along the current battle lines, sources told the Independent, but will not surrender any more territory to Russia despite Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s goal of fully occupying Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts. &#xA0; &#xA0; &quot;It is not reasonable to demand that, for example, Zaporizhzhia or Kherson be fully handed over &#x2014; that sounds like a f*** off to us,&quot; an official said. The White House has insisted that both Russia and Ukraine will have to make compromises in order to end the war, calling Ukraine&apos;s goal of restoring its pre-2014 borders &quot;unrealistic.&quot; U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that the Ukraine-U.S. talks in Saudi Arabia on March 11 included discussions about potential &quot;territorial concessions&quot; as part of a negotiated settlement with Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 12 that Ukraine &quot;will not recognize any occupied territories as Russia&apos;s&quot; as a condition of any peace deal. &quot;This is the most important red line,&quot; he said. Putin said on March 13 that Russia is ready to agree to the U.S.-proposed ceasefire in Ukraine, &#xA0;but only if Kyiv accepts a series of oppressive demands. These include guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops or accept any military aid during the truce. &quot;Putin is playing games. We have made a strong move &#x2014; now it is his turn,&quot; sources told the Independent. &#x201C;We have proved we are reasonable; we are willing to have peace &#x2014; if Russia doesn&apos;t agree, the whole world will see they are liars.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/no-more-lost-territory-return-of-deported-children-kyiv-names-red-lines-for-peace-deal-independent-reports/	2025-03-16T12:57:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2163823789.jpg
West can send troops to Ukraine without Russia's permission, Macron says	Kyiv does not need Russia&apos;s permission to invite peacekeeping troops to its territory, French President Emmanuel Macron said in an interview with French regional newspaper Le Parisien on March 15. &quot;Ukraine is sovereign &#x2013; if it requests allied forces to be on its territory, it is not up to Russia to accept or reject it,&quot; Macron told Le Parisien. Macron has been at the forefront of plans to deploy Western peacekeepers on the ground in Ukraine. Along with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Macron has championed the idea as an alternative security guarantee for Kyiv in the event of a ceasefire. Russia has repeatedly rejected the notion of peacekeeping forces in Ukraine. In the interview, Macron reiterated the importance of supporting Ukraine and confirmed that European forces would be deployed only at Kyiv&apos;s request. He also emphasized the importance of maintaining &#xA0;pressure on Russia and dialogue with key international allies. In the coming days, Macron will meet with newly-elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to discuss Ukraine. Macron&apos;s remarks came shortly before he participated in a virtual summit of the &quot;coalition of the willing,&quot; a group of countries who have pledged to help secure a future peace in Ukraine. During the summit, participating international leaders expressed their support for Kyiv and discussed plans to send 10,000 peacekeeping troops to Ukraine. While the &#xA0;peacekeeping plan is still being finalized by the U.K., France, and other partners, the contingent would likely involve &quot;a few thousand troops&quot; from each country, deployed at &quot;key points&quot; in Ukraine, to conduct training and demonstrate long-term support.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-says-ukraine-can-accept-peacekeeping-troops-without-russian-permission/	2025-03-16T12:12:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2033880055.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine confirms withdrawal from Sudzha in Russia's Kursk Oblast	Key developments on March 15-16: Ukraine&apos;s General Staff on March 16 confirmed Ukrainian troops&apos; withdrawal from the logistics hub of Sudzha in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, days after Moscow claimed its capture. Instead of confirming the withdrawal with a statement, the General Staff posted the latest battlefield maps on social media, which showed a complete retreat from Sudzha. The confirmation comes as Russian troops scale up their offensive in the Russian border region, where Ukraine launched a surprise incursion in August 2024 in hopes of using the captured territories as a bargaining chip for potential peace negotiations. Kyiv has held on to its gradually shrinking foothold in Kursk Oblast despite a deteriorating logistics situation caused by Russia&apos;s intense use of artillery, drones, and glide bombs. As unconfirmed reports of a Ukrainian encirclement circulated online, U.S. President Donald Trump urged his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on March 14 to &quot;spare&quot; allegedly surrounded Ukrainian troops. Ukraine has denied the claims of encirclement. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on March 13 that its troops had captured Sudzha. The claim came a day after Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi confirmed ongoing battles in the suburbs of Sudzha and the surrounding areas. &quot;In the most difficult situation, my priority has been and remains to save the lives of Ukrainian soldiers. To do this, the units of (Ukraine&apos;s) Defense Forces, if necessary, are maneuvering to more favorable positions,&quot; Syrskyi said. Ukraine on March 16 appointed Andrii Hnatov as the new chief of the General Staff, promoting the major general as part of what Kyiv hailed as &quot;a military reform.&quot; Hnatov, who was formerly appointed as the deputy chief of the General Staff in February, will be replacing Anatolii Barhylevych, who took the role in February 2024. &quot;We are systematically transforming the Armed Forces of Ukraine to enhance their combat effectiveness,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said in a Facebook post, applauding a promotion that he said came at his recommendation. Hnatov has over 27 years of experience in the military. He previously commanded a marine brigade, Operational Command East formation, and the Joint Forces of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. Umerov added that Ukraine appointed Lieutenant General Barhylevych as the Defense Ministry&apos;s chief inspector. His role is to oversee military standards and boost discipline in the Armed Forces, according to the minister. More than three years into the full-scale war, Ukraine is slowly withdrawing on multiple fronts amid a critical manpower shortage. Kyiv is trying to modernize the army in an attempt to solve long-standing issues, such as command culture and resource management. &quot;Transformation continues,&quot; Umerov wrote in the same Facebook post. Russian soldiers are amassing at the border to prepare to launch an attack on Ukraine&apos;s northeastern Sumy region, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 15. Zelensky said in a post on Telegram that Ukraine has observed areas along its eastern border where the Russian army is amassing force. &quot;This speaks to a desire to deliver a strike to our Sumy Oblast,&quot; Zelensky wrote. &quot;We understand this and will take countermeasures.&quot; The Ukrainian president also wrote that he hopes foreign leaders would note &quot;that in Moscow they are preparing to ignore diplomacy.&quot; U.S. diplomats were in Moscow this week to hash out a ceasefire deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who remains maximalist in his public demands for concessions from Ukraine. After talks in Saudi Arabia between the U.S. and Ukraine, Kyiv said it was ready to move forward with a ceasefire, provided Russia did the same. Zelensky also wrote that &quot;the situation on the Pokrovsk front has stabilized&quot; after several months during which the city in Donetsk Oblast had been at the center of fighting and periodic threats of Russian encirclement. &quot;Thanks to our Ukrainian forces, a significant quantity of Russian forces were pulled away from other fronts to Kursk Oblast,&quot; Zelensky wrote. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to hold a phone call with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin this week, Steve Witkoff, Trump&apos;s special envoy to the Middle East, said on March 16. &quot;I expect that there will be a call with both presidents this week, and we&apos;re also continuing to engage and have a conversation with the Ukrainians,&#x201D; Witkoff told CNN after meeting Putin in Moscow on March 13. Witkoff also said that the U.S. hopes to &quot;see a ceasefire within weeks,&quot; as cited by Axios. The expected phone call comes as Trump tries to end the war at any cost. European allies and Ukraine have warned that a rushed peace deal without adequate security guarantees won&apos;t result in lasting peace. Witkoff said the talks with Putin lasted a few hours and went well. He added that he expected the phone call between the two presidents to be &quot;really good and positive.&quot; &quot;We&apos;re bridging the gap between two sides,&quot; he said. &quot;The four regions are of critical importance here,&quot; Witkoff said, referring to Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, which are partially occupied by Russian troops. Witkoff also said that the U.S. is holding discussions with Ukraine, Russia, and European allies, including France, the U.K., Finland, &#xA0;and Norway. He claimed that Putin accepts &quot;Trump&apos;s philosophy&quot; on ending Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, Axios reported. &quot;The two sides are a lot closer today than they were a few weeks ago. We narrowed the differences,&quot; Witkoff said. Kyiv agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by the U.S. during talks in Jeddah on March 11, after which Washington resumed military and intelligence support for Ukraine. Russia is ready to agree to the U.S.-proposed ceasefire in Ukraine but demands guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops or receive military aid during the truce, Putin said on March 13. Meanwhile, U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said on March 16 that Ukraine was expected to exchange territories for security guarantees. &quot;This is going to be some type of territory for future security guarantees, the future status of &#x2013; of Ukraine,&quot; Waltz said on ABC News. He also said that &quot;a permanent pathway into NATO, or a permanent membership into NATO for Ukraine is incredibly unlikely.&quot; U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer presented plans to send 10,000 peacekeeping troops to Ukraine at a high-level virtual summit in London on March 15. The summit, which included 29 international leaders, was organized by the U.K. with the purpose of creating a &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; that could secure Ukraine in the event of a peace deal with Russia. Starmer&apos;s proposed peacekeeping contingent would include around 10,000 troops, mostly provided by the U.K. and France, U.K. military sources told the Sunday Times. Thirty-five countries have agreed to supply the peacekeeping mission with weapons, logistics, and intelligence support. The peacekeeping mission will be &quot;a significant force with a significant number of countries providing troops and a much larger group contributing in other ways,&quot; &#xA0;a senior government source said. In addition to European nations, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand joined the call, as did NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. The proposed force of 10,000 is significantly smaller than the 30,000 troops Starmer reportedly pitched to U.S. President Donald Trump during their White House meeting on Feb. 20. Previously, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that European partners would need to station 100,000 to 150,000 troops on Ukraine&apos;s front lines to effectively deter Russia. U.K. defense sources told the Guardian on Feb. 18 that a much smaller European-led peacekeeping forcec ould instead rely on intelligence, surveillance, and long-range monitoring to enforce a ceasefire. Following the virtual summit, Starmer announced that &quot;troops on the ground and planes in the sky&quot; would provide security guarantees for Ukraine following a future peace deal. The allied coalition will hold a second round of military talks on March 20, Starmer said. While France and the U.K. have been the most vocal about sending troops to Ukraine, some countries, including Italy and Finland, have expressed reservations. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni attended the summit and vocalized support for Ukraine, but said that Italy does not plan to participate in the proposed peacekeeping force.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-confirms-withdrawal-from-sudzha-in-russias-kursk-oblast/	2025-03-16T11:15:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2165345310.jpg

U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are expected to hold a call this week to discuss the terms of the ceasefire, Trump&apos;s Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said on March 16. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-proposes-10-000-peacekeeping-troops-for-ukraine/	2025-03-16T10:45:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194219228.jpg
Suspect pleads guilty to murder of Odesa activist Demyan Hanul	Serhii Shalaiev, the man detained and charged with the killing of Ukrainian activist Demyan Hanul, pled guilty to the murder in a closed court hearing on March 16, according to regional prosecutor Ruslan Veremchuk. Hanul, 31, was shot dead in central Odesa on March 14. Hanul was well-known for his public activism, including his participation in Ukraine&apos;s EuroMaidan Revolution and the May 2 clashes against pro-Russian forces in Odesa. The suspect, 46-year-old Serhii Shalaiev, pleaded guilty to Hanul&apos;s murder in a closed court session, the news outlet Suspilne reported, citing Veremchuk. Shalaiev was detained hours after the shooting and identified as a deserter by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). Prosecutors charged Shalaiev with premeditated murder committed under order and illegal handling of weapons. Veremchuk, deputy head of the Odesa Specialized Prosecutor&apos;s Office for Defense of the Southern Region, said the hearing was held in a closed session to protect the identities of testifying witnesses. He also said investigators are still working to determine who else may have been involved in Hanul&apos;s murder. &quot;The perpetrator of this crime has been detained,&quot; Veremchuk said. &quot;One of the versions of the investigation is that it was a contract killing. Measures are being taken to identify the customer and other accomplices in the crime.&quot; Shalaiev has been wanted for military desertion since February 23, according to the SBU. He reportedly served as commander of a platoon in the 28th separate mechanized brigade. The court has imposed a pre-trial detention order on Shalaiev, who will be held in custody for 60 days without possibility of bail. Andrii Nebytov, deputy head of the National Police, previously said during a television broadcast on March 15 that investigators were considering three possible versions of the crime: a contract killing linked to Hanul&apos;s political activism, a crime of personal animosty, and an assassination linked to Russia. Hanul was a public figure and blogger who founded the Street Front NGO. He was active in rallies supporting Ukraine, charity fundraisers for the military, and campaigns to dismantle the city&apos;s Soviet and imperial monuments. The activist had previously reported threats against his life. In July 2024, Hanul claimed Russian sources had leaked personal information about his relatives and that a $10,000 bounty was offered for an attack on him. In reaction to the murder, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that dozens of law enforcement officials are involved in the investigation. &quot;I have instructed the interior minister, the head of the Security Service, the acting prosecutor general to throw all the necessary forces and means to establish all the facts,&quot; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/suspect-pleads-guilty-to-murder-of-odesa-activist-demyan-hanul/	2025-03-16T10:03:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2205194636.jpg
Ukraine appoints Andrii Hnatov as new chief of General Staff	Ukraine on March 16 appointed Andrii Hnatov as the new chief of the General Staff, promoting the major general as part of what Kyiv hailed as &quot;a military reform.&quot; Hnatov, who was formerly appointed as the deputy chief of the General Staff in February, will be replacing Anatolii Barhylevych, who took the role in February 2024. &quot;We are systematically transforming the Armed Forces of Ukraine to enhance their combat effectiveness,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said in a Facebook post, applauding a promotion that he said came at his recommendation. Hnatov has over 27 years of experience in the military. He previously commanded a marine brigade, Operational Command East formation, and the Joint Forces of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. Umerov added that Ukraine appointed Lieutenant General Barhylevych as the Defense Ministry&apos;s chief inspector. His role is to oversee military standards and boost discipline in the Armed Forces, according to the minister. More than three years into the full-scale war, Ukraine is slowly withdrawing on multiple fronts amid a critical manpower shortage. Kyiv is trying to modernize the army in an attempt to solve long-standing issues, such as command culture and resource management. &#xA0; Drawing on the experience of NATO partners, Ukraine is currently trying to implement a corps system instead of a brigade one, in an effort to improve cohesion. &quot;Transformation continues,&quot; Umerov wrote in the same Facebook post.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-appoints-andrii-hnatov-as-new-chief-of-general-staff/	2025-03-16T09:23:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1850843477.jpg
Air Force says 47 Russian drones shot down overnight	Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported on March 16 that it had shot down 47 Russian Shahed and other drones across the country overnight. Russian troops attacked Ukraine with 90 drones, targeting Kyiv, Kharkiv, Poltava, Sumy, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, and Odesa oblasts, according to the Air Force&apos;s report. The Air Force added that it had lost track of 33 Russian decoy drones but said that they had caused no damage. Russia&apos;s aerial attack against Ukraine comes as the U.S. is negotiating with Russia on a potential 30-day ceasefire, which Kyiv agreed to earlier in March. Russian drone attacks have targeted Ukraine every day. Since the start of the full-scale war, Russia has regularly launched drone and missile attacks on Ukraine, including cities far from the front line. The attacks have often targeted civilian sites and critical infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/47-russian-drones-shot-down-overnight-air-force-says/	2025-03-16T08:32:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1489471985.jpg
Trump-Putin phone call expected this week, White House envoy says	U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to hold a phone call with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin this week, Steve Witkoff, Trump&#x2019;s special envoy to the Middle East, said on March 16. &#x201C;I expect that there will be a call with both presidents this week, and we&#x2019;re also continuing to engage and have a conversation with the Ukrainians,&#x201D; Witkoff told CNN after meeting Putin in Moscow on March 13, as cited by Reuters.

US launches airstrikes on Iranian-backed rebels as Trump orders 'decisive' military action	The U.S. launched airstrikes against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen on March 15 as President Donald Trump ordered &quot;decisive&quot; military action against the group. Trump also said that the U.S. would hold Iran &quot;fully accountable&quot; if it didn&apos;t end support for the Houthi rebels &quot;immediately.&quot; The U.S. attack against the Houthi rebels and the threat to Iran come as Moscow continues to expand its partnership with Tehran. Iran has provided Russia with thousands of Shahed drones used in attacks against Ukrainian cities, as well as short-range ballistic missiles. The strikes on the Houthis also come amid increasing tensions between their main backer, Iran, and Israel, which is supported by the U.S., including a controversy over Tehran&apos;s nuclear weapons program. &quot;Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen,&quot; Trump said in a post on Truth Social, claiming that his predecessor Joe Biden&apos;s approach was &quot;pathetically weak.&quot; &quot;They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones.&quot; Trump said the U.S. would deploy &#x201C;overwhelming lethal force&#x201D; against the rebels &#x201C;until we have achieved our objective.&quot; CNN reported, citing the Houthi-run health ministry, that at least 31 people had been killed and 101 injured in Yemen by the U.S. strikes, and that most of the casualties were women and children. The Kyiv Independent could not verify this information. Despite worsening relations between the U.S. and Iran, Trump&apos;s team is trying to resume the long-frozen diplomatic relations with one of Tehran&apos;s backers, Russia. On March 13, Trump&apos;s special envoy Steve Witkoff paid a visit to Moscow for talks on the 30-day ceasefire proposal that Ukraine had accepted after a U.S.-Ukrainian meeting in Saudi Arabia on March 11.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-launches-strikes-on-iranian-backed-rebels-in-yemen/	2025-03-16T05:41:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204730188.jpg
Ukraine confirms withdrawal from Sudzha in Russia's Kursk Oblast	Ukraine&apos;s General Staff on March 16 confirmed Ukrainian troops&apos; withdrawal from the logistics hub of Sudzha in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, days after Moscow claimed its capture. Without confirming the withdrawal with a statement, the General Staff posted the latest battlefield maps on social media, which showed a complete retreat from Sudzha. The confirmation comes as Russian troops scale up their offensive in the Russian border region, where Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion in August 2024 in hopes of using the captured territories as a bargaining chip for potential peace negotiations. Kyiv has held on to its gradually shrinking foothold in Kursk Oblast despite a deteriorating logistics situation caused by Russia&apos;s intense use of artillery, drones, and glide bombs. As unconfirmed reports of a Ukrainian encirclement circulated online, U.S. President Donald Trump urged his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on March 14 to &quot;spare&quot; allegedly surrounded Ukrainian troops. Ukraine has denied the claims of encirclement. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on March 13 that its troops had captured Sudzha. The claim came a day after Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi confirmed ongoing battles in the suburbs of Sudzha and the surrounding areas. &quot;In the most difficult situation, my priority has been and remains to save the lives of Ukrainian soldiers. To do this, the units of (Ukraine&apos;s) Defense Forces, if necessary, are maneuvering to more favorable positions,&quot; Syrskyi said.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-confirms-withdrawal-from-sudzha-kursk-oblast/	2025-03-16T03:22:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166820734.jpg
Trump denies reports on his envoy waiting for Putin, calls media 'sick degenerates'	U.S. President Donald Trump on March 15 denied reports that his special envoy Steve Witkoff had waited for hours for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Sky News reported on March 14, citing footage, that Witkoff had waited at least eight hours for Putin while the Russian leader was meeting Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, in what appeared to be a classic power play. Witkoff paid a visit to Moscow on March 13 for talks on the 30-day ceasefire proposal that Ukraine had accepted after a U.S.-Ukrainian meeting in Saudi Arabia on March 11. &quot;The fake news, as usual, is at it again!&quot; Trump said in a post on Truth Social. &quot;Why can&apos;t they be honest, just for once? Last night I read that President Vladimir Putin of Russia kept my highly respected Ambassador and Special Envoy, Steve Witkoff, waiting for over nine hours when, in fact, there was no wait whatsoever.&quot; &#xA0; Trump attacked the media that reported the story, saying that their purpose is &quot;to demean&quot; and calling them &quot;sick degenerates.&quot; He claimed that &quot;other meetings with other representatives of Russia did take place and, obviously, they took some time, but they were very productive.&quot; &quot;From there, things went quickly and efficiently, and all signs seem to be, hopefully, very good!&apos; Trump added. Putin said on March 13 that Russia was ready to agree to the U.S.-backed 30-day-long ceasefire in Ukraine but then followed by listing a number of demands &#x2014; a ban on Ukrainian mobilization or training of troops and a halt on Western military aid for Kyiv. Putin also hinted that Ukrainian troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast must surrender. Talks on a potential ceasefire come as Trump pushes for a rushed peace deal to end the war at any cost, keeping European and Ukrainian officials on alert.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-denies-reports-that-witkoff-waited-hours-for-putin/	2025-03-16T02:07:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196945288.jpg

Canada contributes additional $35 million toward restoring energy infrastructure in Ukraine	Canada contributed another 50 million Canadian dollars ($34.8 million) to the Ukraine Energy Support Fund, Ukraine&apos;s Energy Ministry said on March 14. Days prior, Ukraine received the first tranche of a loan of $1.7 billion covered by frozen Russian assets from Canada, the Ukrainian Finance Ministry announced on March 13. &quot;As Russia continues its ruthless attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, leaving millions without electricity, water, and heat, Canada is proud... to continue the important work it is doing to help Ukraine repair its critical infrastructure,&quot; Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said in a statement. Canada&apos;s total contribution to the Ukraine Energy Support Fund is now over $41 million. Canada also declared a future contribution of 10 million Canadian dollars ($7 million) to the fund. The Ukraine Energy Support Fund raises costs to restore energy facilities and support critical infrastructure. &quot;Contributions to the Energy Support Fund are directed toward purchasing equipment necessary for restoring energy facilities after enemy attacks and ensuring the stable operation of Ukraine&#x2019;s energy system,&quot; Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said. Part of the new contribution will go towards the healthcare sector to support critical social infrastructure through the development of solar energy to support operations. The added funding will help ensure the stable operation of the energy industry in Ukraine by restoring critical energy reserves for energy companies, Canada&apos;s International Development Minister Ahmed Hussen said. Various countries contribute to the Ukraine Energy Support Fund established in 2022 with the help of the EU. Iceland allocated over $2 million to the fund on March 11 and Italy promised to contribute $13.5 million on Feb. 28. Russian aerial attacks regularly target civilian infrastructure, including energy services. Support from allies has proven to be crucial in maintaining Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/canada-contributes-an-additional-36-million-to-ukraine-energy-support-fund/	2025-03-15T21:26:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1255039162.jpg
Italy does not plan to send peacekeepers to Ukraine, remains committed to 'effective security guarantees'	Italy does not plan to participate in a peacekeeping force on the ground in eastern Ukraine to guarantee a potential ceasefire, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni&apos;s office said on March 15. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosted an online summit of the &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; earlier on March 15. Attendees discussed how each nation could contribute to securing Ukraine in the event of a peace deal with Russia. Meloni attended the U.K.-led virtual summit on March 15 alongside 24 other nations at the multilateral event. Italy does not have plans to participate in a peacekeeping force on the ground in Ukraine, a statement put out by Meloni&apos;s office following the meeting read. Italy will continue to work with European and Western allies to &quot;define credible and effective security guarantees&quot; for Ukraine, the statement added. Following the summit, Ukraine&apos;s allies reaffirmed their support for the embattled nation and condemned Russia for its war against Ukraine. &quot;Russia does not give the impression of a country that sincerely desires peace... It does not respond to the proposals of the United States and Ukraine. It intensifies hostilities. President Putin wants to get everything and then negotiate,&quot; French President Emmanuel Macron said. While the U.K. and France have been the most vocal in supporting troops on the ground in Ukraine, leaders of other nations have expressed reservations about a military force. &quot;It is still too early to talk about putting troops on the ground because we don&#x2019;t have a ceasefire, we don&#x2019;t have a peace process... Once we have a clear plan, we start doing the commitments,&quot; Finnish President Alexander Stubb said on March 15. Stubb affirmed Finland&apos;s support for Ukraine but in line with other nations bordering Russia such as Poland, Finland has sought to offer Ukraine security in other ways while retaining troops on its own territory. In the face of the U.S. repeatedly ruling out NATO membership for Ukraine, Meloni said on March 6 that NATO could extend Article 5 protections to Ukraine without granting membership in the alliance. &quot;We need to think about more durable solutions&quot; than just sending European peacekeepers to Ukraine, Meloni said on the sidelines of an EU leaders meeting in Brussels on March 6. &quot;It&#x2019;s a different thing than entering NATO, but it implies extending the coverage that NATO countries have also to Ukraine,&quot; she added.	https://kyivindependent.com/italy-does-not-plan-to-send-peacekeepers-to-ukraine-remains-committed-to-just-peace/	2025-03-15T19:16:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2189976147-1.jpg
Rubio discusses 'next steps' in phone call with Russia's Lavrov	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. State Secretary Marco Rubio held a phone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on March 15 as Washington attempts to persuade Moscow to accept a 30-day ceasefire deal. According to a statement by the U.S. State Department, Rubio and Lavrov discussed steps to restore contacts between the U.S. and Russia. &quot;Secretary Rubio and Foreign Minister Lavrov discussed next steps to follow up on recent meetings in Saudi Arabia and agreed to continue working towards restoring communication between the United States and Russia,&quot; State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement. Rubio also informed Lavrov of the United States&apos; operation on Houthi militants in Yemen. U.S. President Donald Trump announced earlier on March 15 on Truth Social that the U.S. had launched &quot;decisive and powerful Military (sic) action&quot; against the group. No additional details were provided on the call by the U.S. State Department. A similar readout by the Russian Foreign Ministry provided no additional details. Following talks with U.S. officials on March 11, Kyiv agreed to a temporary ceasefire, as long as Russia also abides by its terms. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on March 13 that Russia is ready to agree to the U.S.-proposed ceasefire in Ukraine but demands guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops, nor receive military aid during it. Putin&apos;s hesitation to implement a ceasefire comes as the United States resumed security assistance and intelligence sharing to Ukraine following breakthrough high-level talks in Saudi Arabia. As negotiations continue, Trump claimed during a speech at the Justice Department on March 14 that the White House has received &quot;some pretty good news&quot; regarding its attempts to secure a 30-day ceasefire agreement &#x2014; without specifying what the news was. Earlier on March 14, Trump claimed he asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to &quot;spare&quot; Ukrainian troops he said were surrounded by Russian forces in Kursk Oblast &#x2014; a claim he repeated during his speech. Kyiv has denied reports that its troops are encircled in Kursk. Rubio said on March 14 said that the administration was &quot;cautiously optimistic&quot; about progress towards a ceasefire, but added that the situation remains &quot;complex.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/rubio-discusses-next-steps-in-phone-call-with-russias-lavrov/	2025-03-15T18:09:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194442240.jpg
Duda denounces Russia for 'imperial greed,' reiterates calls to deploy US nuclear weapons in Poland	Polish President Andrzej Duda denounced Russia for its &quot;imperial greed&quot; in a wide-ranging interview with the BBC published on March 15. Duda called on the U.S. to deploy its nuclear weapons to Poland in an interview published on March 13. U.S. Vice President JD Vance said he would be &quot;shocked&quot; if the U.S. fulfilled Poland&apos;s request in response to Duda later that day. &quot;Ukraine must be sovereign and independent because otherwise there will be no peace, it will only be the end of the war due to the occupation of Ukraine by Russia,&quot; Duda said. The Polish president expressed his trust in U.S. President Donald Trump in resolving Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, saying accusations that Trump does not want to see Ukraine at the negotiating table are &quot;false.&quot; &quot;(A)s I understand it, President Trump does not want to be a participant, but rather a mediator,&quot; Duda said. The Polish leader noted that Ukraine&apos;s meeting with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia on March 11 ended on a positive note. At the bilateral meeting, the White House agreed to resume military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv. Ukraine agreed to a U.S. proposal for a temporary 30-day ceasefire, Russia did not. &quot;The meeting with Ukraine was successful, and the Russian side, as you can see, is behaving the way it is behaving,&quot; Duda said. Russia is an &quot;aggressor&quot; that invaded Ukraine and is &quot;killing civilians,&quot; Duda said, adding that Russia transferred nuclear weapons to Belarus as an &quot;obvious offensive tactic&quot; and not for defense purposes. &quot;As long as Russia uses offensive tactics, Russia is an aggressor. Russia attacked Ukraine without reason, it was not provoked in any way. It is an attack that was justified only by Russia&apos;s imperial greed, which wants to subjugate a state and its people,&quot; Duda said. The Polish president reiterated his calls for U.S. nuclear weapons to be stationed in Poland and welcomed calls for a French nuclear umbrella to protect Europe, including Poland. &quot;(I)t is a security issue because these weapons are not offensive, these weapons are defensive. I emphasize again, they are intended to protect primarily from a nuclear attack,&quot; Duda said. &quot;Secondly, it was Russia, without asking anyone, that deployed its nuclear weapons in Belarus. This is no secret to anyone, Putin openly spoke about it in an interview,&quot; Duda added. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko previously said that the transfer of Russian tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus was completed in early October 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/duda-denounces-russia-for-imperial-greed-in-interview-with-bbc/	2025-03-15T17:01:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1504051081.jpg
Everyone is really shocked and upset' — Trump administration puts Voice of America journalists on leave, cuts funding to Radio Free Europe	The Trump administration on March 15 followed up a on an executive order signed a day earlier by President Donald Trump vowing to gut funding for the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees Voice of America (VOA) and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). As a result of the executive order which deemed USAGM as among &quot;elements of the federal bureaucracy that the president has determined are unnecessary,&quot; grant funding to U.S.-funded media outlet RFE/RL was terminated. Journalists and employees working at U.S.-funded Voice of America were also placed on administrative leave. In an email obtained by the Kyiv Independent, employees at VOA were instructed &quot;not to enter USAGM premises&quot; nor &quot;access USAGM systems.&quot; &quot;You will be expected to immediately surrender your official USAGM identification badge and press pass, as well as any keys or other official government property, including documents, records, electronic and telephone devices, and other equipment,&quot; the email sent to VOA employees continued. &quot;Everyone is really shocked and upset, but we saw some signs of those decisions coming,&quot; a VOA journalist who was placed on leave told the Kyiv Independent on the condition of anonymity. In recent weeks, the government&apos;s human resource department sent emails to employees asking for personal emails and phone numbers in case they needed to be contacted, the VOA journalist told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We were suspicious obviously.&quot; &quot;Everyone is still shocked even though its been expected because everyone saw Elon Musk&apos;s tweets.&quot; Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who serves as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), on Feb. 9 called for shutting down RFE/RL and VOA. Responding to comments by U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Special Missions Richard Grenell, Musk wrote on X: &quot;Yes, shut them down. Europe is free now (not counting stifling bureaucracy). Nobody listens to them anymore. It&#x2019;s just radical left crazy people talking to themselves while torching $1B/year of US taxpayer money.&quot; Musk has criticized federal payments to media organizations like Politico, the Associated Press, and The New York Times, deeming them inefficient uses of taxpayer funds and moving to eliminate them. &quot;We are still considered government employees but not for long. No one is expecting that it will last,&quot; a VOA journalist said, adding that employees are expecting termination to be applied by the end of next week. Politico reported on March 14 that U.S. government-backed broadcaster Radio Free Asia was furloughing about 300 U.S.-based staff next week due to the suspension in funding. The move comes as Ostap Yarysh, a prominent Ukrainian correspondent at VoA, was dismissed on March 7, reportedly following an inspection by DOGE. The New York Times reported on Feb. 28 that the USAGM, which oversees VOA, launched an investigation into journalists who had spoken out against Trump&#x2019;s policies. VOA Director Mike Abramowit said in a statement on social media that over 1,300 journalists, producers and support staff were place on leave, criticizing the move as &quot;failing to protect U.S. interests.&quot; &quot;Even if the agency survives in some form, the actions being taken today by the Administration will severely damage Voice of America&#x2019;s ability to foster a world that is safe and free and in doing so is failing to protect U.S. interests,&quot; Abramowit wrote. In addition to the leave imposed on journalists at VOA, grant funding to U.S.-funded media outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) was put to a halt. In a letter sent by USAGM senior advisor Kari Lake, a staunch Trump supporter and former news anchor turned Republican Senate candidate, current U.S. government grant funding was terminated on March 15. &quot;This letter provides notice that that the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) is terminating you federal grant... and any other grants with USAGM,&quot; the letter obtained by journalists reads. In response to the termination of funding, Stephen Capus, the head of RFE/RL &#x2014; which first began broadcasting into the Soviet Union during the Cold War &#x2014; said that the decision was &quot;a massive gift to America&apos;s enemies.&quot; &quot;The Iranian Ayatollahs, Chinese communist leaders, and autocrats in Moscow and Minsk would celebrate the demise of RFE/RL after 75 years. Handing our adversaries a win would make them stronger and America weaker,&quot; Capus added. Trump has long criticized U.S.-funded media organizations, criticizing them over their coverage of the U.S. president, and often referring to them as &quot;fake news.&quot; In total, the networks reach an estimated 427 million people across the world and employed thousands of employees across the United States, Cuba, Europe, and Asia. The Trump administration has previously cut thousands of federally-funded positions, with the cuts directly impacting support for Ukraine. In February, the Trump administration terminated the employment of top officials from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) after they attempted to prevent representatives from Elon Musk&#x2019;s DOGE from accessing restricted areas.	https://kyivindependent.com/everyone-is-really-shocked-and-upset-trump-administration-puts-voice-of-america-journalists-on-leave-cuts-funding-to-radio-free-europe/	2025-03-15T16:13:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/gettyimages-2204719493-612x612.jpg
‘Painful for Russia:’ What new U.S. sanctions on Russian energy mean for Moscow	The Trump administration dealt a blow to Russia&apos;s energy sector last week after it let lapse an exemption allowing Russian banks to use U.S. payment systems for energy transactions. The move closed an important financial channel for Russian oil and gas exports and comes as Washington looks for ways to pressure Moscow to agree to a U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was open to a deal, but has demanded concessions from Kyiv before moving forward. A license put in place by the Joe Biden administration at the start of the full-scale invasion had allowed a number of Russian banks to continue receiving energy payments in U.S. dollars. The move aimed to prevent sharp increases in energy prices and avoid an energy crisis in countries dependent on Russian energy resources while otherwise maintaining sanctions pressure on Russia&apos;s financial system. As part of the Biden administration&#x2019;s most sweeping sanctions against Russia implemented in January at the end of Biden&#x2019;s term, the license&#x2019;s expiration date was cut short from the usual six-month period and scheduled to end on March 12. Allowing the license to expire &#x201C;is painful for Russia,&quot; said Ihor Burakovsky, head of the Board at the Institute for Economic Research and Policy Consulting. &quot;Oil and gas is the key sector of the Russian economy &#x2014; its key source of export revenues.&quot; &quot;Any restrictions that complicate countries&apos; access to the international financial system create serious problems for their economies,&#x201D; Burakovsky told the Kyiv Independent. Although most Russian banks were disconnected from SWIFT in early 2022, certain institutions, particularly Gazprombank, were permitted to process payments for energy exports. Foreign buyers paid in euros or dollars into special accounts at Gazprombank, after which the currency was converted to rubles to comply with Putin&apos;s demands for &quot;ruble payments&quot; for gas. &quot;This makes it harder for Russia to get paid for their energy,&quot; said James Angel, associate professor at the Georgetown School of Business. &quot;They have to go to more trouble to feed their war machine. Until they find an alternative way to get value for their energy, they will have less to spend on bombing Ukraine. Eventually, they will find a less efficient way to get paid.&quot; Burakovsky also noted that Russia is adept at finding ways around sanctions. Russia has created a large shadow fleet of approximately 800 vessels to evade sanctions put in place after the start of the full-scale invasion. Many of the fleet&apos;s ships &#x2014;&#xA0;poorly maintained and with murky owners that pose security and environmental risks &#x2014; are already under U.S. and EU sanctions. The new restrictions on payments undermine the Russian economy by significantly complicating energy exports &#x2014; the country&apos;s main source of income, experts say. &quot;The banking sector and access to international finance is currently the Achilles&apos; heel of the Russian economy,&quot; said Burakovsky. Traditional sanctions against Russia&apos;s oil and gas sector included restrictions on equipment supplies and extraction technologies and setting a price ceiling of $60 per barrel for oil. The new restrictions complicate a key aspect of Russia&#x2019;s energy sector &#x2014; conducting settlements between buyers and Russian exporters. Russia will be forced to seek alternative routes by using shadow schemes to circumvent restrictions or conducting payments in national currencies, Burakovsky said. This creates additional hurdles, especially with countries like India and China. &quot;Since the Indian rupee is not a freely convertible currency, it is very difficult to take it out of India. This creates a situation where Russia supplies oil to certain countries, but the money remains there,&quot; said Burakovsky. To circumvent Western sanctions, Russia has also begun using cryptocurrencies in oil transactions with China and India. Burakovsky notes that although the U.S. cannot completely stop Russia due to small volumes of bilateral trade, restricting access to the international financial system is &quot;an extremely painful issue.&quot; That could explain Russia&#x2019;s demands in lifting sanctions on oil exports as part of a ceasefire agreement. As Trump looks to negotiate a swift end to the war, his team has increasingly ramped up pressure on Kyiv and President Volodymyr Zelensky while making few demands of the Russian side so far. This has led to speculation that Trump could try to force Kyiv into an unfavorable peace deal that would effectively amount to Ukraine&#x2019;s surrender. The new sanctions could, however, be a signal from the Trump administration that it is ready to use sanctions to exert pressure on Moscow to agree to both a ceasefire and a peace deal. &quot;Closing this loophole now is a way to demonstrate greater resolve in the fight against Russian aggression and that the U.S. has not turned into Putin&apos;s puppet,&quot; said Angel. The new sanctions close what he describes as a critical &quot;loophole&quot; in the previous sanctions regime, he said. While Trump may be looking for a quick resolution to the war and granting Russia sanctions relief as part of any deal, sanctions are a joint effort by a coalition of 47 countries, including the EU, Australia, Japan, and Canada. &quot;Trump understands that the U.S. is an economic, military and political power, but in today&apos;s world its dominance is not absolute,&quot; Burakovsky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/painful-for-russia-what-new-u-s-sanctions-on-russian-energy-mean-for-moscow/	2025-03-15T14:18:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1477537303.jpg
Trump appoints Kellogg as Special Envoy to Ukraine, removes him from dealings with Russia	U.S. President Donald Trump appointed General Keith Kellogg as Special Envoy to Ukraine on March 15, where he will communicate directly with Ukrainian leadership rather than participate in negotiations with Russia as previously intended. Initially appointed as Trump&#x2019;s Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Kellogg was to be involved in direct peace talk efforts between the two countries. However, recent NBC News reports indicate that he was excluded from high-level peace at the Kremlin&apos;s request as Moscow perceived as being too sympathetic to Ukraine. &#x201C;General Kellogg, a Highly Respected Military Expert, will deal directly with President Zelensky, and Ukrainian leadership. He knows them well, and they have a very good working relationship together. Congratulations to General Kellogg!&#x201D; Trump announced on Truth Social. Although Trump did not explicitly say he would be removing Kellogg from dealings with Russia, the change in title is likely reflective to changing attitudes within Russia. Kellogg responded to the new appointment on X, thanking Trump for the new opportunity. &#x201C;I am deeply honored and humbled by President Trump&#x2019;s confidence in appointing me as Special Envoy to Ukraine. I have been privileged to have known Trump since 2015, and he will END THIS WAR. It is an honor to serve our great nation and advance the vital interests of the United States. America First!&#x201D; Kellogg wrote. Kellogg previously co-authored a peace plan that would freeze the front line in Ukraine, take NATO accession off the table for an extended period, and partially lift sanctions imposed on Russia. His peace proposals also call for continued U.S. military aid to Ukraine as well as strong security guarantees to Kyiv to prevent further Russian aggression. Kellogg previously visited Kyiv in late February for discussions with Ukrainian officials, but had since not been involved in a U.S. delegation in talks with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-appoints-kellogg-as-special-envoy-to-ukraine/	2025-03-15T13:15:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199838039.jpg
Western leaders reaffirm support for Ukraine following virtual summit hosted by Starmer	Western leaders reiterated their support for Ukraine following a virtual summit hosted by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on March 15, where leaders from 25 countries were in attendance. The virtual summit convened countries who could form a post-war peacekeeping force within Ukraine. As of March 13, the potential coalition consists of 37 countries, with the U.K. and France largely taking the lead as the only countries who have publicly committed to sending troops to Ukraine post-war. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese emphasized Australia&#x2019;s commitment to Ukraine, pledging to stand with the country &quot;for as long as it takes.&quot; &quot;I reiterated Australia&#x2019;s strong and steadfast support for Ukraine and restated that Australia will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,&quot; Albanese said in an official statement following the summit. He also stated that Australia is open to contributing to future peacekeeping efforts. &quot;President Putin&#x2019;s regime has imperialist designs, for Ukraine and beyond,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We must ensure Russia&#x2019;s illegal and immoral actions are not rewarded through any peace process.&quot; German Chancellor Olaf Scholz reaffirmed Germany&#x2019;s support for Ukraine, stating that &quot;Ukraine needs a just and lasting peace.&quot; He thanked Keir Starmer for convening the meeting and stressed that &quot;it is up to Russia to end the attacks and finally make peace possible.&quot; French President Emmanuel Macron criticized Putin, and accused Moscow of failing to engage in peace talks in good faith. &quot;Russia does not give the impression of a country that sincerely desires peace,&quot; Macron said after the summit. &quot;It does not respond to the proposals of the United States and Ukraine. It intensifies hostilities. President Putin wants to get everything and then negotiate.&quot; Macron argued that &quot;peace through strength&quot; remains the key to ending the conflict and that collective Western pressure on Russia is necessary. He also praised President Zelensky for proposing a ceasefire initiative and stated that for peace to last, Ukraine must have a &quot;strong army that defends its country.&quot; Finnish President Alexander Stubb expressed Finland&#x2019;s willingness to support Ukraine but was cautious about direct military involvement, in comments to the BBC. &quot;It is still too early to talk about putting troops on the ground because we don&#x2019;t have a ceasefire, we don&#x2019;t have a peace process,&quot; Stubb told the BBC. &quot;Once we have a clear plan, we start doing the commitments.&quot; Stubb emphasized that there are &quot;anywhere from zero to 50 different ways&quot; to support Ukraine, but insisted that direct military involvement would only be considered if a peace deal is reached. The virtual summit highlighted the growing pressure on Russia to engage in meaningful peace talks while reinforcing Western unity in supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s defense and long-term stability.	https://kyivindependent.com/western-leaders-reaffirm-support-for-ukraine-following-virtual-summit-hosted-by-starmer/	2025-03-15T12:26:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1775102025.jpeg
Russian attacks in Nikopol kill 1, injure 3, including children	Russia attacked the town of Nikopol in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast over a dozen times on March 15, killing one woman and injuring three people, including two children, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. Two girls, aged 11 and 3 years old, were injured in the attacks, Lysak said. The children are being treated at a medical facility in Dnipro. A 70-year-old woman was killed, according to Ukraine&apos;s General Prosecutor&apos;s Office. Prosecutors have launched a war crimes investigation as a result of the civilian casualties. Another woman, aged 57, also suffered injuries, but is receiving outpatient care, Lysak said. Russia attacked Nikopol and the surrounding communities with artillery and drones on March 15, according to Lysak. The attacks damaged a religious institution, five homes, two outbuildings, 15 solar panels, a car, and a power line. Nikopol, located on the banks of the destroyed Kakhovka Reservoir, just across from Russian-occupied Enerhodar and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, is a regular target of Russian attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-in-nikopol-kill-1-injure-3-including-children/	2025-03-15T10:51:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/nikopol.jpg
EU 'without Ukraine' — Hungary's Orban posts list of demands to Brussels	Budapest has a series of demands for the European Union, including the exclusion of Ukraine from membership in the bloc, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced on March 15. Orban, widely regarded as the EU&apos;s most pro-Russian leader, has repeatedly opposed military aid for Ukraine and warned that Ukraine&apos;s EU membership would &quot;destroy&quot; Hungary. The list of demands comes shortly after the EU reportedly struck a deal with Hungary to renew sanctions on more than 2,400 primarily Russian targets hours before they were set to expire on March 15. &quot;What does the Hungarian nation demand from Brussels?&quot; Orban wrote on X. &quot;Let there be peace, freedom, and unity.&quot; He then listed 12 demands, the last of which reads: &quot;A Union, but without Ukraine.&quot; Orban&apos;s other demands include banning &quot;the unnatural re-education of our children,&quot; protecting &quot;Europe&#x2019;s Christian heritage,&quot; and &quot;peace in Europe.&quot; Under Orban&apos;s right-wing government, Hungary has repeatedly clashed with the EU, leveraging its member state veto power to obstruct sanctions against Moscow and deepening ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin despite Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. At an emergency summit on security for Europe and Ukraine held on March 6, 26 EU member states denounced Russian aggression and pledged continued support for Kyiv, while Hungary was the lone dissenting nation. In exchange for Hungary lifting its veto on the recent sanctions renewal, the EU on March 14 agreed to remove four individuals from the list, fewer than half the number Budapest had demanded. &#xA0;The EU will likely face another confrontation with Budapest in July, when a package of economic sanctions against Russia is up for extension. At the end of 2024, Hungary became the first EU member to lose out on over $1 billion in funds due to violations of EU standards. The bloc could take further action against Budapest if tensions continue to mount. &#xA0; If a majority of member states agree, Hungary could even be stripped of its voting rights and veto power. Ukraine applied for EU membership in 2022 and was granted candidate status within months. Accession talks began in June 2024, with European leaders setting 2030 as a target for Ukraine&apos;s potential entry.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-without-ukraine-hungarys-orban-posts-list-of-demands-to-brussels/	2025-03-15T10:29:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1689139196.jpg
Putin is lying to everyone' — Zelensky calls for 'strong pressure' on Russia after UK summit	President Volodymyr Zelensky on March 15 called for an international coalition to intensify pressure on Moscow and meet with skepticism any claims from Russian President Vladimir Putin about the situation on the battlefield. &quot;Putin is lying to everyone about the situation on the ground,&quot; Zelensky said in a post on X following a virtual summit of European leaders. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer convened the summit on March 15, bringing together 25 members of the &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; &#x2014;&#xA0;Ukraine&apos;s allies who have agreed to support future peacekeeping efforts. Along with European partners, the coalition now includes Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Japan. Following the talks, Starmer announced that the coalition&apos;s peacekeeping efforts were ready to move into the &quot;operational phase.&quot; Zelensky welcomed the coalition&apos;s plans to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine and urged world leaders to apply &quot;strong pressure&quot; to Moscow in order to secure a ceasefire deal. &quot;The world must understand that Russia is the only obstacle preventing peace,&quot; he said. Ukraine has agreed to accept a U.S. proposal for a 30-day interim ceasefire, provided Russia agrees to its terms. Putin on March 13 said that Russia was ready to agree to the ceasefire, but then demanded that Kyiv limit mobilization and training of troops during that period. He also demanded that the West halt all military aid to Ukraine as a condition of the ceasefire. Some analysts have said Putin&apos;s conditions amount to Ukraine&apos;s surrender. Putin has also claimed that Russian troops have encircled Ukrainian soldiers fighting in Kursk Oblast, a report Kyiv has vehemently denied. Zelensky directed his appeal beyond Europe and Western partners, calling on Latin American, Asian, and African nations to recognize that &quot;Putin has been lying to the world&quot; and to back strategies that advance &quot;peace through strength.&quot; in a week we&apos;ll have one	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-is-lying-to-everyone-zelensky-calls-for-strong-pressure-on-russia-after-uk-summit/	2025-03-15T09:42:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/ze.jpeg
Russia readying to attack Sumy as Donbas front stabilizes, Zelensky says	Russian soldiers are amassing at the border to prepare to launch an attack on Ukraine&apos;s northeastern Sumy region, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 15. Zelensky said in a post on Telegram that Ukraine has observed areas along its eastern border where the Russian army is amassing force. &quot;This speaks to a desire to deliver a strike to our Sumy Oblast,&quot; Zelensky wrote. &quot;We understand this and will take countermeasures.&quot; The Ukrainian president also wrote that he hopes foreign leaders would note &quot;that in Moscow they are preparing to ignore diplomacy.&quot; U.S. diplomats were in Moscow this week to hash out a ceasefire deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who remains maximalist in his public demands for concessions from Ukraine. After talks in Saudi Arabia between the U.S. and Ukraine, Kyiv said it was ready to move forward with a ceasefire, provided Russia did the same. Zelensky also wrote that &quot;the situation on the Pokrovsk front has stabilized&quot; after several months during which the city in Donetsk Oblast had been at the center of fighting and periodic threats of Russian encirclement. More recently, Russia has made major advances in Kursk Oblast, a territory in Russia that Ukrainian forces took in August and which Zelensky&apos;s administration had hoped to use as leverage in negotiations. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief has refuted recent reports that Ukrainian troops were under threat of encirclement in Kursk Oblast as Russia pushed further into Ukrainian-held Russian territory. &quot;Thanks to our Ukrainian forces, a significant quantity of Russian forces were pulled away from other fronts to Kursk Oblast,&quot; Zelensky wrote.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-as-the-donbas-stabilizes-russia-is-readying-to-attack-sumy/	2025-03-15T08:39:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/Ze.jpeg
Zelensky appoints Yermak to lead Ukraine's peace delegation	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a decree on March 15 creating a new delegation for international peace negotiations. The delegation will be led by Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelensky&apos;s office, the decree, published on the president&apos;s website, says. Other members include Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Yermak&apos;s deputy, Pavlo Palisa. According to the decree, Yermak, as head of the delegation, has the authority to modify its composition with the approval of the foreign minister. He can also bring on additional government officials, experts, and advisors. Yermak, Sybiha and Umerov also comprised the delegation who negotiated a deal with U.S. representatives in Jeddah for a 30-day ceasefire with fairly limited conditions, including a vague offer to allow U.S. companies into Ukrainian precious mineral mining. Ukraine, Russia and the U.S. are currently locked in negotiations over a potential ceasefire. After a U.S. delegation was in Moscow this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was open to a ceasefire deal, but listed a number of demands of Ukraine that would effectively subjugate Ukraine. Following the talks in Moscow, President Donald Trump said that the &quot;U.S. has received &apos;some pretty good news&apos; on Ukraine-Russia ceasefire, without providing further details. Yermak has been described in the past as the most powerful chief of staff in Ukraine&apos;s history, and has attracted criticism for accumulating unprecedented power and influence within the Zelensky&apos;s Presidential Office. Late last year, Politico included Yermak among the finalists for the &quot;dreamers&quot; category as part of its yearly list of the most influential people in Europe. &quot;Nearly three years into Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, Andriy Yermak&#x2019;s focus has moved from trying to win the war to trying to win the peace,&quot; Politico wrote of Yermak. The former television producer became Zelensky&#x2019;s chief of staff in 2020, becoming an indispensable gatekeeper for the Ukrainian president, dubbed &quot;The Fixer&quot; by Politico.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-appoints-yermak-to-lead-ukraines-peace-delegation/	2025-03-15T08:02:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2039876667.jpg
UK's Starmer says 'troops on the ground and planes in the sky' could secure Ukraine peace deal	Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced today that an expanded coalition of nations is ramping up efforts to back Ukraine in peace negotiations with Russia, following a high-level virtual summit in London on March 15. The coalition, which now includes more partners than were at the initial Lancaster House meeting two weeks ago, will also hold military talks on March 20 to develop &quot;stronger and robust plans&quot; for Ukrainian security guarantees, Starmer said in a press conference following the summit. &quot;We will now move to the operational phase,&quot; Starmer told reporters, emphasizing that the upcoming military discussions will focus on concrete security guarantees that could include &quot;troops on the ground and planes in the sky&quot; if necessary. &quot;We know from history, recent history, that a deal without security arrangements is not something which (Russian President Vladimir) Putin respects,&quot; Starmer said, warning that without proper security guarantees, &quot;Putin will breach the line again.&quot; Starmer also said that participating nations are actively discussing the seizure of frozen Russian assets as part of intensified economic pressure on Moscow. While acknowledging the legal complexities involved, Starmer confirmed that the coalition agreed to implement additional sanctions against Russia immediately. &quot;We agree we will keep increasing the pressure on Russia, keep the military aid flowing to Ukraine, and keep tightening restrictions on Russia&apos;s economy,&quot; Starmer said, calling Russian Putin&apos;s conditional response to peace overtures &quot;not good enough.&quot; Starmer was, however, vague on specific measures he and allies would take to compel Putin to drop some of his more exorbitant demands in ceasefire negotiations. Putin on March 13 said that Moscow was ready to agree to a U.S.-backed 30-day ceasefire but demanded that as part of any cessation of hostilities Kyiv would limit mobilization, training of troops and the West would halt military aid to Ukraine. Some have said Putin&apos;s demands amount to Kyiv&apos;s surrender. The expanded coalition now includes members from Europe, Canada and Australia as well as backing from Japan. Despite the U.S. under President Donald Trump disavowing much of his predecessor&apos;s Ukraine support, Starmer was keen to highlight his national security advisor&apos;s recent discussions in Washington. &quot;We are talking to the U.S. every day about what happens next,&quot; Starmer said, expressing confidence that President Trump is &quot;absolutely committed&quot; to achieving lasting peace in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/uks-starmer-offers-ukraine-troops-on-the-ground-and-planes-in-the-sky/	2025-03-15T07:09:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193577260.jpg
Inside Ukraine's desperate fight to stabilize Donbas front	Amid the escalating geopolitical circus, Ukrainian soldiers fighting in between order and chaos assert that the only way to stop Russia remains on the battlefield. The Kyiv Independent spent two weeks in the Pokrovsk and Kurakhove sectors of the front line in Donetsk Oblast, speaking to infantry and artillery commanders, medics, and the civilians now coming into Russia&apos;s line of fire.	https://kyivindependent.com/inside-ukraines-desperate-fight-to-stabilize-donbas-front/	2025-03-15T06:15:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_1354.jpg
Russia attacks Ukraine with 178 drones overnight, targets energy infrastructure	Ukrainian defense forces intercepted 130 out of the 178 Russian attack drones launched at Ukraine during an overnight assault on March 14 that included attacks on energy infrastructure. The attack involved two Iskander-M ballistic missiles launched from Kursk Oblast and 178 Shahed-type attack drones along with various decoy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. &#xA0; The wave of attacks began at 7:30 p.m. local time on March 14 and continued throughout the night. Russia launched the drones from multiple locations including Orel, Millerovo, Kursk, Bryansk, and Primorsko-Akhtarsk in Russia, as well as Chauda in occupied Crimea. The Air Force reported that it shot down 130 Shahed-type strike drones and other UAVs over fourteen Ukrainian regions including Kharkiv, Poltava, Sumy, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, and Mykolaiv oblasts. An additional 38 Russian decoy drones were reported &quot;locationally lost&quot; without causing any damage. The attack caused damage in the Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Odesa, Sumy, Chernihiv, and Kyiv regions. Officials have yet to release information about casualties or details of the damage entailed. Reports indicate that the Russian attack hit Ukrainian energy infrastructure in Dnipropetrovsk and Odesa Oblast. Russia has been steadily expanding its air campaigns against Ukraine in recent months, with bombardments by flocks of Shahed drones a nightly occurrence. Ukraine has recently had some success in counterattacks. On the night of March 10, over 330 Ukrainian drones made it to Moscow. Subsequent strikes have hit Russia&apos;s fossil fuel infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-attacks-ukraine-with-178-drones-overnight-most-intercepted/	2025-03-15T05:39:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/477294535_1198923984935722_5644506664633572859_n-2.jpg
UK Prime Minister Starmer begins summit of Ukraine allies	U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has kicked off an online summit on March 15 of the &quot;coalition of the willing,&quot; who could go on to secure Ukraine in the event of a peace deal with Russia. Starmer urged attendees to &quot;keep the pressure up&quot; on Russian President Vladimir Putin in his opening remarks. The ongoing virtual summit is convening countries who could form a post-war peacekeeping force within Ukraine. As of March 13, the potential coalition consists of 37 countries, with the U.K. and France largely taking the lead as the only countries who have publicly committed to sending troops to Ukraine post-war. Twenty-five nations are attending today, per the U.K. government, which wrote that the meeting would seek &quot;concrete commitments.&quot; The European Union is by and large increasingly taking point on securing Ukraine&apos;s future. Following on a similar meeting at the outset of March, the summit is taking place just days after a U.S. delegation was in Moscow to discuss a ceasefire deal with Putin. Starmer in a statement on March 14 warned Putin against &quot;playing games&quot; with these ceasefire negotiations. Putin has maintained maximalist demands for Ukrainian to cede territory beyond what Russia has actually taken, as well as demilitarization. Starmer himself has become a leading light within European politics for his advocacy of Ukraine, as well as his singular talent at placating U.S. President Donald Trump. The U.K. and the U.S. have what&apos;s referred to the &quot;Special Relationship&quot; &#x2014; deep relations in trade, security and defense, and intelligence. A Starmer spokesperson said last week that, &quot;We&#x2019;ve always said that Ukraine, at the other end of this process, must emerge as a sovereign territory.&quot; The summit represents a pivot in the West&apos;s strategy toward the war in Ukraine to planning for post-conflict stability rather than solely focusing on immediate military support. Putin has been hostile to the presence of foreign soldiers in Ukraine to secure any sort of peace post-war. Ukraine maintains that without firm security guarantees from the West, Putin will use any cessation in hostilities to build up and attack Ukraine again.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-prime-minister-hosts-summit-of-ukraine-allies/	2025-03-15T03:59:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199562091.jpg
Senator Mark Kelly gets rid of his Tesla after Musk calls him 'traitor' for visiting Ukraine	Senator Mark Kelly said he was getting rid of his Tesla Model S after billionaire Elon Musk called the senator a &quot;traitor&quot; on his social media platform X for visiting Ukraine just days after the U.S. paused military aid to Kyiv. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m here in Washington driving to work for the last time in my Tesla,&#x201D; Kelly, a Democrat from Arizona, said in a video posted on X on March 14. &quot;When I bought this thing, I didn&#x2019;t think it was going to become a political issue. Every time I get in this car in the last 60 days or so, it reminds me of just how much damage Elon Musk and Donald Trump is doing to our country,&quot; he said in the video. Musk, owner of SpaceX and now head of the U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), called Kelly a &quot;traitor&quot; on X on March 10 in a thread of the senator&apos;s trip to Ukraine, which included visits with officials and embassy staff, as well as nurses, volunteers, and soldiers. Kelly, a former Navy pilot and astronaut who used to work with Musk&apos;s SpaceX, swiftly replied, criticizing Musk&#x2019;s stance. &quot;Traitor? Elon, if you don&apos;t understand that defending freedom is a basic tenet of what makes America great and keeps us safe, maybe you should leave it to those of us who do,&quot; he wrote on March 10. Along with his video saying that he was ditching his Tesla on March 14, Kelly wrote, &quot;I bought a Tesla because it was fast like a rocket ship. But now every time I drive it, I feel like a rolling billboard for a man dismantling our government and hurting people. So Tesla, you&#x2019;re fired!&quot; &quot;New ride coming soon,&quot; he wrote. The Musk-Kelly exchange came amid heightened tensions between the Trump administration and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and a heated argument in the Oval Office earlier this month. As the Trump team looks to bring a swift end to the war in Ukraine, it has increasingly put pressure on Kyiv, including temporarily pausing military aid and intelligence sharing, while so far making little demands of Russia and President Vladimir Putin.	https://kyivindependent.com/senator-mark-kelly-gets-rid-of-his-tesla-after-musk-calls-him-traitor-for-visiting-ukraine/	2025-03-15T01:35:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GlohTV5W8AAtNmS.jpeg
General Staff: Russia has lost 892,840 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 892,840 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on March 15. The number includes 1,180 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,315 tanks, 21,458 armored fighting vehicles, 40,571 vehicles and fuel tanks, 24,483 artillery systems, 1,315 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,103 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 29,233 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-892-840-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-03-15T00:45:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/IMG_2727--1--2.jpg
Fire erupts near railway station in Russia's Volgograd amid drone strike on oil refinery, media reports	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A fire broke out in a field near the Sarepta railway station in the Russian city of Volgograd in the early hours of March 15, the Russian news channel Astra reported, citing local accounts and geolocated footage. The fire erupted during on ongoing drone attack targeting a nearby oil refinery, residents said. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. The fire is reportedly located near a Gazprom gas station and the Sarepta railway station, several kilometers from the refinery, according to footage geolocated by Astra. Residents of Volgograd reported hearing several explosions and said drones were targeting the city. Russian authorities have not commented on the reported attack. The Volgograd refinery, owned by Russian oil giant Lukoil, has been targeted in previous attacks, most recently in a drone strike on Feb. 15. Ukrainian drones also attacked the facility on Jan. 31, according to the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. The refinery has been targeted multiple times throughout the full-scale war. Ukraine considers Russian oil refineries to be valid military targets, as fossil fuel products and profits continue to supply Moscow&apos;s war machine. The Ukrainian military has launched repeated attacks against Russian refineries with long-range drones.	https://kyivindependent.com/fire-erupts-near-railway-station-in-russias-volgograd-amid-drone-strike-on-oil-refinery-media-reports/	2025-03-14T21:33:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/Image-1_Lukoil-Volgograd-Refinery-Russia.jpeg
US has received 'some pretty good news' on Ukraine-Russia ceasefire, Trump claims	The White House has received &quot;some pretty good news&quot; regarding its attempts to secure a 30-day ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine, U.S. President Donald Trump claimed during a speech at the Justice Department (DOJ) on March 14. Following talks with U.S. officials on March 11, Kyiv agreed to a temporary ceasefire, as long as Russia also abides by its terms. Washington is now attempting to persuade Moscow to accept the deal. &quot;We&apos;ve had some very good calls today with Russia and with Ukraine,&quot; Trump said during his DOJ speech. &quot;They&apos;ve agreed for a ceasefire if we can get it with Russia, and it&apos;s not easy. It&apos;s a tough one. But I think we&apos;re doing it. ... I think we&apos;ve had some very good results. I haven&apos;t been able to say that to anybody else, I haven&apos;t wanted to say it until just before I came here, I got some pretty good news.&quot; Trump did not say what the good news was, nor did he provide additional details on the content of the negotiations. Despite his note of optimism, he acknowledged that there is still &quot;a long way to go.&quot; &#xA0; Earlier in the day, Trump claimed he asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to &quot;spare&quot; Ukrainian troops he said were surrounded by Russian forces in Kursk Oblast &#x2014;&#xA0;a claim he repeated during his speech. Kyiv has denied reports that its troops are encircled in Kursk. Trump also repeated his standard talking point on Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine: namely, that former U.S. President Joe Biden should not have &quot;let&quot; the war happen. &quot;Biden should have never let this war happen,&quot; he said. &quot;First of all, you don&apos;t want to pick on someone that&apos;s a lot larger than you, even with the money. That&apos;s a lot of money that we gave them.&quot; Trump has historically been hesitant to condemn Russia&apos;s blatant aggression and violations of sovereignty, instead preferring to lay the blame on the Biden administration and Ukraine&apos;s own NATO ambitions. Putin said on March 13 that Russia was ready to agree to the proposed 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, but soon followed that up with demands that Ukraine ban mobilizing and training more troops and that the West halt all military aid to Kyiv. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on March 14 said that the administration was &quot;cautiously optimistic&quot; about progress towards a ceasefire, but added that the situation remains &quot;complex.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-has-received-some-pretty-good-news-on-ukraine-russia-ceasefire-trump-claims/	2025-03-14T20:06:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2205126563.jpg
Germany on track to commit $3.2 billion in military aid to Ukraine, Merz says	A German parliamentary coalition has agreed to allocate 3 billion euros (approximately $3.2 billion) in new military aid to Ukraine as part of a plan to dramatically scale up Berlin&apos;s defense spending, incoming chancellor Friedrich Merz announced on March 14. Merz presented his ambitious spending plan to lawmakers in early March, saying he hoped to secure approval for the military aid under the current, outgoing parliament. A coalition of Merz&apos;s conservative Christian Democratic allliance (CDU/CSU), the Social Democratic Party (SPD), and the Green Party have agreed to reform Germany&apos;s &quot;debt brake&quot; rules and increase defense spending, Merz said in Berlin on March 14. Their combined backing gives Merz the necessary two-thirds support to secure approval when the budget is up for a vote on March 18. &quot;Germany is back,&quot; Merz said. &quot;Germany is making its large contribution to the defense of freedom and peace in Europe.&quot; Outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has confirmed that he will release the additional aid to Ukraine once parliament approves the defense spending package, Merz told reporters. Merz&apos;s ambitious plans for Germany&apos;s defense budget have taken shape amid a wider shift in European security policy. The continent is moving to rearm and assume greater responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s defense amid abrupt changes in U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump. Germany&apos;s next parliament is due to convene on March 25. Roughly one-third of the seats will be held by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the Left Party (Die Linke), both of which oppose military aid for Ukraine. Germany has allocated 4 billion euros ($4.1 billion) in military support for Ukraine this year, and the additional package would raise this to 7 billion ($7.2 billion). The defense articles contained in the new assistance include three IRIS-T air defense systems, three Skyranger air defense systems, 10 howitzers, surface-to-air missiles, 20 protective vehicles, artillery shells, and drones, the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported in January.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-to-commit-3-2-billion-in-military-aid-to-ukraine-merz-says/	2025-03-14T19:02:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200927348.jpg
G7 ministers affirm support for Ukraine amid US tensions with allies	Despite tensions between the Trump administration and several U.S. allies over trade policies and other disputes, G7 foreign ministers meeting in Canada reaffirmed their commitment to Ukraine. The diplomats from Canada, the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the European Union presented a united stance on supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty, though their final statement was notably less forceful than in previous years. The group&#x2019;s communiqu&#xE9;, released on March 14, affirmed Ukraine&#x2019;s &quot;territorial integrity and right to exist,&quot; while condemning Russian &quot;acts of aggression.&quot; However, its language was softer than the G7 leaders&#x2019; statement from November 2024, which had pledged &quot;unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes&quot; and labeled Russia &quot;the sole obstacle&quot; to peace. The shift in tone reflects the diplomatic challenges posed by U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s approach to foreign policy, which has at times questioned U.S. support for Kyiv. During the meeting in La Malbaie, Quebec, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio faced pressure from allies to clarify Washington&#x2019;s position on Ukraine. While he avoided direct confrontation, Rubio emphasized that the U.S. and its partners would &quot;not let things that we don&#x2019;t agree on stop us from agreeing on other things.&quot; Meanwhile, European ministers made symbolic gestures of solidarity with Ukraine. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and EU diplomat Kaja Kallas posted a photo of themselves dressed in Canada&#x2019;s national colors alongside a message to Joly: &quot;We&#x2019;ve got your back.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/g7-ministers-affirm-support-for-ukraine-amid-us-tensions-with-allies/	2025-03-14T18:05:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204487239.jpg
US 'cautiously optimistic' on ceasefire progress after Putin meeting	The Trump administration sees &quot;cautious optimism&quot; in ongoing ceasefire negotiations following a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. The envoy is expected to return this weekend, after which President Donald Trump will assess Russia&#x2019;s position and determine the next steps, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on March 14. &quot;There is reason to be cautiously optimistic, but by the same token, we continue to recognize this is a difficult and complex situation,&quot; Rubio added. &quot;It will not be easy. It will not be simple. But we certainly feel like we&#x2019;re at least some steps closer to ending this war and bringing peace.&quot; Kyiv has agreed to a temporary ceasefire proposed by Washington during the March 11 talks in Jeddah, contingent on Russia&#x2019;s adherence. The negotiations in Saudi Arabia also led to the U.S. resuming key military and intelligence support for Ukraine. &quot;Ukraine is not an obstacle to peace; it is a partner in restoring it,&quot; said Deputy Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, who participated in the talks. He emphasized that Ukraine&apos;s acceptance of the proposed truce demonstrates &quot;who is really interested in peace.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin said on March 13 that Moscow is prepared to accept the ceasefire but demanded that Ukraine halt mobilization, military training, and foreign military aid deliveries during the truce. Trump called Putin&apos;s remarks &quot;very promising&quot; but &quot;not complete,&quot; adding that he is open to meeting with the Russian leader. Rubio emphasized that U.S. foreign policy is based on actions rather than trust. When asked whether he believes Putin&#x2019;s commitments, Rubio dismissed the question. &quot;It&#x2019;s not about trusting, it&#x2019;s about actions,&quot; he said. &quot;You either do things or you don&#x2019;t. That&#x2019;s what foreign policy is driven by, and that&#x2019;s how our decisions should be made.&quot; While the White House sees progress, officials acknowledge the challenges of securing a ceasefire that meets U.S. and Ukrainian conditions. The administration expects further internal discussions this weekend after Witkoff briefs Trump on his talks in Moscow. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s been a good week on that front, but there&#x2019;s a lot of work that remains to be done,&quot; Rubio said. &quot;We&#x2019;ll know more once Special Envoy Witkoff returns and we have a chance to all convene and talk about it.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/rubio-says-us-cautiously-optimistic-on-ceasefire-progress-after-putin-meeting/	2025-03-14T16:29:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193483462.jpg
Macron urges Russia to accept US-Ukraine ceasefire proposal	French President Emmanuel Macron called on Russia to accept a proposed 30-day ceasefire deal put forward by the United States and Ukraine. Macron said he discussed the situation on March 14 with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and President Volodymyr Zelensky. In his evening address, Zelensky said that he and Macron had talked about diplomatic efforts, the feasibility of a ceasefire, and the technical aspects of its oversight. He emphasized that Ukraine has France&#x2019;s full support in these matters. Ukraine has started assembling a team to develop monitoring mechanisms for a potential 30-day ceasefire, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha announced on March 14. Speaking at a press conference in Kyiv alongside Austrian Foreign Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger, Sybiha emphasized the complexity of establishing an effective oversight process. &quot;We have already started forming a national team to develop appropriate processes to properly control a possible ceasefire. This is an extremely complex process,&quot; he said. Kyiv agreed to the U.S.-proposed truce during March 11 talks in Jeddah, contingent on Russia&#x2019;s adherence to its terms. The negotiations also resulted in Washington resuming military and intelligence assistance to Ukraine. Sybiha underscored the logistical challenges of enforcing a ceasefire along Ukraine&#x2019;s 1,300-kilometer (800-mile) front line. Ukraine remains skeptical of Russian intentions, citing past violations of the Minsk agreements. &quot;So now everything will be aimed at ensuring that the Ukrainian side is ready with the appropriate teams, developments, and modalities,&quot; Sybiha added. According to Kyiv, Russia violated the previous Minsk accords 25 times. On March 13, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow was open to accepting the ceasefire but insisted that Ukraine suspend mobilization, military training, and foreign military aid deliveries for the duration of the truce. U.S. President Donald Trump responded to Putin&#x2019;s remarks, calling them &quot;very promising&quot; but &quot;not complete,&quot; and indicated a willingness to meet with the Russian leader. Zelensky dismissed Putin&#x2019;s statement, warning that Russia is already laying the groundwork to reject the ceasefire.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-urges-russia-to-accept-us-ukraine-ceasefire-proposal/	2025-03-14T15:00:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2167956439.jpg
‘I can’t sit and watch it’ – US volunteers join Ukrainian army after Trump’s sharp policy turn	Editor&#x2019;s note: Soldiers interviewed for this article are identified only by their first name, callsign, or nickname due to security reasons. William, a 25-year-old U.S. Army veteran, has come to Ukraine to join the Ukrainian military in its fight against Russian aggression just days after his contract with the U.S. military ended in March. The artilleryman&#x2019;s original plan was to come here in summer, but as the new U.S. President Donald Trump made a dramatic U-turn in Ukraine policy, the need to travel to the war-torn country felt more urgent. &#x201C;It&apos;s frustrating to sit around doing nothing when you know you can do something right,&#x201D; William told the Kyiv Independent a day before leaving for Ukraine. William says he has felt drawn to Ukraine ever since the 2013-2014 EuroMaidan Revolution in Kyiv. As a high school student in Tennessee, he was moved by the Ukrainian uprising against a pro-Russian, anti-Western regime. He is among the many Americans who have decided to join the Ukrainian army during the full-scale invasion, especially after the heated exchange between Trump, his Vice President JD Vance and President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Oval Office on Feb. 28. In the following week, the U.S. abruptly suspended its military aid and intelligence sharing for Ukraine &#x2013; before resuming it this week. However, the U.S.&#x2019; increasing alignment with Russia continues to cast doubt on the future of its support for Ukraine. One of the most elite Ukrainian units accepting foreign volunteers received &#x201C;a massive spike&#x201D; of applications, according to an international serviceman involved in recruiting. The source, who spoke anonymously due to his unit&#x2019;s regulations, said that a few thousand applications came in after the Oval Office meeting, with &#x201C;a significant amount of guys expressing outrage and shock over what has been happening with the shift in American policy.&#x201D; U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky meet in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on Feb. 28, 2025. (Photo by Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)Another recruit, Ron, &#xA0;who was previously deployed in Afghanistan with the U.S. Army, said he contacted the Ukrainian military as soon as Trump took office and the U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing bans were set forth. Feeling &#x201C;embarrassed by my country,&#x201D; the American exit in supporting Ukraine &#x201C;sealed it for me&#x201D; to come fight in Ukraine, the 35-year-old Colorado native explained. &#x201C;I&apos;m a patriot. I love my country. But the people who are in charge of it right now are destroying it, just destroying what it should stand for,&#x201D; Ron told the Kyiv Independent a month before his departure for Ukraine. &#x201C;It&apos;s an absolute shame to me. I just can&apos;t sit by and watch it happen anymore, especially when the people of Ukraine are so freaking brave, and they&apos;re doing such great work with the limited equipment we have given them.&#x201D; While Ron said he was &#x201C;shocked&#x201D; that Trump was reelected as the president, he, like some other American recruits, also cautiously hoped that &#x201C;maybe he would actually do the right thing on Ukraine.&#x201D; &#x201C;But that first month of him in the office just completely shattered any illusion of that for me,&#x201D; Ron said. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s just selfish and only wants quick fixes,&#x201D; Ron added, referring to the U.S. trying to pressure Ukraine into a rushed peace deal to end the war at any cost. Trump has pledged to end the war quickly, resuming the long-frozen diplomacy with Russia and priding himself on having a &#x201C;very close relationship&#x201D; with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. Trump&#x2019;s America-first policy has also left European nations on alert. Media reports have suggested that he is considering a dramatic shift in the U.S.&#x2019;s involvement in NATO, refusing to defend another member state as part of Article 5 if it doesn&#x2019;t meet the defense spending threshold. Worried that the U.S. could eventually completely abandon Europe, Ron said he decided that he needs to do his part to avoid what he believes could be &#x201C;a general war in Europe with Russia&#x201D; in the near future. A former U.S. Army Cavalry Scout, who goes by his callsign Juggernaut, also said he &#x201C;felt sick to the stomach&#x201D; after seeing the U.S. decreasing its support for Ukraine despite Russia&#x2019;s horrific war crimes against civilians across the country. He finished his seven-year contract with the U.S. Army a week after Trump&#x2019;s inauguration. He came over to Ukraine in February and is currently awaiting training with a Ukrainian unit. Although he voted for Trump in 2024, the 28-year-old Hawaii resident said he felt &#x201C;really disappointed&#x201D; in his leadership even though he understands the America-first policy. &#x201C;We only have so long on this earth, and worrying about ourselves isn&#x2019;t going to bring us any gratification at the end of our lives,&#x201D; Juggernaut told the Kyiv Independent from eastern Ukraine. He said that his fear of coming here and &#x201C;dying for no reason&#x201D; faded when he arrived in Ukraine and saw first-hand what the country and its people were going through. &#x201C;I kind of stopped thinking like that because I&apos;m a spiritual person, and it made me sick to my stomach, the idea of Russians taking over this country and these people here suffering even more than they already have,&#x201D; Juggernaut said. A 40-year-old father and lawyer from Texas, who introduced himself as Esquire, is another recruit waiting in Kyiv to join the Ukrainian military. While he has no prior army experience, he said he made the decision to enlist because he did not want to live for the rest of his days knowing he was &#x201C;a coward.&#x201D; Esquire wonders if his two kids and his wife, who begged him not to go, would ever forgive him for making what everyone back home believed would be &#x201C;a meaningful sacrifice,&#x201D; but he stressed that he could not just watch the world turn upside down. &#x201C;I feel betrayed, sickened, and like my country is no longer what I thought it was,&#x201D; Esquire told the Kyiv Independent at a cafe in Kyiv. &#x201C;I mourn my country like I mourn a dead friend.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/a-massive-spike-in-foreign-volunteers-joining-ukrainian-army-after-us-sharp-policy-turn/	2025-03-14T14:36:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204541704.jpg
Ukraine’s cyber chief wants ‘tens of thousands’ more computer whizzes to combat Russian hackers	Formally a brigadier general, Oleksandr Potiy is today tasked with guarding Ukraine on the civilian side &#x2014; far from the battlefield but right at the front line of Russia&#x2019;s cyber war. Potiy is in camo fatigues when he addresses the crowd of IT workers and foreign investors for the keynote address at the Kyiv International Cyber Resilience Forum that took place on March 11-12. &#x201C;Our priority is a departure from the traditional schema of a KSZI,&#x201D; Potiy tells the Kyiv Independent in an interview on the conference&#x2019;s sidelines, referring to a Soviet acronym for information defense that had a reputation of being corrupt. &#x201C;We totally changed the approach.&#x201D; In December, Potiy took charge of Derzhspetszvyazku, or the State Service of Special Communications. The agency guards the Ukrainian government&#x2019;s digital infrastructure. It&#x2019;s a job that&#x2019;s grown massively in the four years since Potiy first joined the agency, which now has a headcount of 1,300. Russia has long been a breeding ground for some of the most aggressive hackers in the world. As an overture to the February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, those hackers launched a salvo of cyber attacks at Ukraine, one that continues to the present day. Despite systems &#x2014; including massive telecomms networks &#x2014; going down periodically, Ukraine has remained remarkably steadfast in the face of this assault. The agency monitors and tracks upwards of 3,000 attacks each year on the Ukrainian civil government alone &#x2014; not including the military, whose digital security falls to the Defense Ministry and intelligence agencies. The most recent report for the first half of 2024 counts among major threats a DDoS gang going by &#x201C;From Russia with Love&#x201D; and another cyber gang based in Russian-occupied Luhansk who &#x201C;factually are traitors,&#x201D; per the report. Those are in addition to hacking groups long associated with Russian intelligence and General Staff like Sandworm and Armageddon. Attacks have included a spear-phishing campaign that used QR codes to short-circuit Signal &#x2014; increasingly a go-to messenger for Ukrainians seeking security away from Russian-originated Telegram &#x2014; and link hostile devices that government officials are unaware are reading their classified or private comms. The aggregate figure of the most recent report notes a significant increase in the total number of attacks but a merciful decline in those defined as &#x201C;critical&#x201D; from 31 to 3. Nonetheless, Ukraine needs a new training and certification scheme, Potiy said, ambitiously aiming at fostering a new generation of cyber security specialists, &#x201C;tens of thousands if not more,&#x201D; with solid jobs within Ukraine. It is one of his core ambitions for his first year in charge of the agency. &#x201C;We have educational institutions that turn out cybersecurity specialists who could provide services,&#x201D; Potiy continued. &#x201C;But there&#x2019;s no job market.&#x201D; Aside from a simple mass of professional cybersecurers, Potiy aims to distribute the authorities &#x2014; decentralization, in other words. Centralization is one of the cardinal sins of cybersecurity, one that was likely responsible for a collapse in government data that rattled Ukraine in December. The agency is taking as a model for a new regional network of cyber offices the European Union&#x2019;s National Coordination Centers. An overarching goal of the Ukrainian government is the &#x201C;harmonization&#x201D; of its practices with EU law &#x2014; preparation for eventually joining the union. At the conference, the agency signed a memorandum of understanding with a number of European counter-parties, entailing some fairly vague concepts of cooperation. Part of what that translates to in practice is data-sharing from the agency to the West on the cyberattacks they face, Potiy explains. &#x201C;We have obtained unique experience, which today can prove useful to partners from around the world,&#x201D; Potiy told the crowd at the conference&#x2019;s opening. The Ukrainian cyber dataset is potentially extremely valuable for Western cybersecurity agencies, as many of the attacks Russian hackers are launching against Ukraine today are easy enough to replicate on Western systems tomorrow. Speaking on what turned into the last day of frozen U.S. weapons aid and intel sharing with Ukraine, Potiy noted that the agency had not stopped providing its network of data to analogous Western cyber agencies, including the American CISA. &#x201C;We have a very tight relationship with our American partners and friends,&#x201D; Potiy said. &#x201C;We, as competent technical professionals, are still working with them like we worked before.&#x201D; In addition to its cyber duties, by an odd set of circumstances at the war&#x2019;s outset, the agency ended up holding the purse strings for Ukraine&#x2019;s drone purchases. It retains, today, a budget of Hr 65 billion &#x2014; just over $1.5 billion. Potiy&#x2019;s own ascension in December was part of a scandal in which anti-corruption activists raised alarms that the new office would stop publishing information on those drone purchases, including cost and quantity, on Ukraine&#x2019;s public platform for government acquisitions, Prozorro. &#x201C;Everything&#x2019;s done in accordance with the legislation of Ukraine, including acquisitions going through Prozorro,&#x201D; said Potiy. When asked if that was going to change, Potiy answered, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s established procedure.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-cyber-chief-talks-decentralization-and-the-need-for-tens-of-thousands-more-computer-whizzes-to-combat-russian-hackers/	2025-03-14T13:45:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/1-187.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Kyiv denies Trump's claims of Ukrainian encirclement in Kursk Oblast	Key developments on March 14: Ukraine&apos;s General Staff on March 14 denied claims that Ukrainian troops were encircled in Kursk Oblast amid Russia&apos;s ongoing offensive in the region. The General Staff said that Russia had been reporting an alleged encirclement of Ukrainian forces in Kursk Oblast &quot;for political purposes and to put pressure on Ukraine and its partners.&quot; The statement came after U.S. President Donald Trump said that his administration held &quot;productive discussions&quot; with Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 13, during which he urged him to &quot;spare&quot; surrounded Ukrainian troops. &quot;At this very moment, thousands of Ukrainian troops are completely surrounded by the Russian military, and in a very bad and vulnerable position,&quot; Trump wrote, without providing any evidence. Speaking during a meeting of Russia&apos;s Security Council, Putin claimed on March 14 that some Ukrainian troops &quot;are blocked&quot; in the embattled Russian region. Following Trump&apos;s remarks, he said that Ukrainian soldiers must surrender in Kursk Oblast. Neither Trump nor Putin provided evidence that Ukrainian troops are currently surrounded at any location. &quot;The units have regrouped, moved to more favorable defense lines and are completing their assigned tasks in Kursk Oblast,&quot; the General Staff said. &quot;There is no threat of encirclement of our units.&quot; &quot;Our soldiers are repelling the enemy&apos;s offensive and inflicting effective fire damage from all types of weapons.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. Later in the day, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on March 14 that the Kursk operation &quot;has completed its task.&quot; He said that Ukraine was able to stabilize the situation near Pokrovsk as well. Drones launched by Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) struck two gas compressor stations and a warehouse storing missiles for Russia&apos;s S-300/S-400 air defense systems, an intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on March 14. The long-range drones targeted gas compressor stations in Russia&apos;s Tambov and Saratov oblasts, according to the source. Another strike reportedly hit a missile depot near the village of Radkovka in Belgorod Oblast, triggering a detonation of stored ammunition. &quot;The SBU conducted another successful special operation on enemy territory, causing significant damage to Russia&apos;s budget and reducing its ability to finance and sustain the war,&quot; the source said. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. Ukrainian drones struck the Tuapse oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai overnight on March 14, setting fire to a gasoline storage tank, regional Governor Veniamin Kondratiev said. &quot;The area of the fire is more than 1,000 square meters, and emergency services are working,&quot; Kondratiev wrote on Telegram, claiming there were no casualties. Russian pro-government media outlet Mash reported that the fire was caused by debris from a downed drone. Eyewitnesses reportedly heard a series explosions over several minutes. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Kyiv has not commented on the attack. The Tuapse oil refinery, with an annual processing capacity of 12 million tons, plays a key role in supplying fuel to the Russian military. Following an earlier strike, the facility underwent an emergency shutdown in May 2024. Russian President Vladimir Putin has not abandoned his maximalist goal of controlling Ukraine, despite U.S. efforts to broker a ceasefire, the Washington Post (WP) reported on March 13, citing sources familiar with classified U.S. intelligence reports. Putin has a &quot;long-standing desire to restore &#x2018;Mother Russia&apos;&quot; and remains determined to assert power over Kyiv, one official said commenting on the U.S. intelligence assessment circulated among President Donald Trump&apos;s administration on March 6. Some officials reportedly believe that even if Russia agrees to a temporary truce, Moscow will use the pause to rearm, violate the agreement, and create provocations to blame on Ukraine. Moscow views Trump as weak, lacking a basic set of principles, and potentially open to manipulation, a European intelligence official told WP, citing fresh intelligence. If a permanent ceasefire is reached, Russia is likely to revert to the &quot;hybrid&quot; or non-military tactics it used to undermine Ukraine before its full-scale invasion in 2022, the official added. U.S. officials are reportedly cautious in assessing what peace terms Putin might agree to, but see no indication that he has backed down from his demand to bring Kyiv into Russia&apos;s sphere of influence. The fate of Ukraine&apos;s Russian-occupied territories was discussed with the U.S. during the talks in Saudi Arabia earlier this week, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on March 14. Zelensky&apos;s comments come days after Kyiv agreed to a 30-day ceasefire put forth by the U.S. during the negotiations in Jeddah. Russian President Vladimir Putin placed demands in order to begin talks on a possible ceasefire that included guarantees to not mobilize or train new troops, nor receive military aid during from the West. Previously, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Ukraine-U.S. talks included discussions about potential &quot;territorial concessions&quot; as part of a negotiated settlement with Russia. According to Zelensky, discussions of the territories were not part of the meeting&apos;s agenda. He reiterated that Ukraine will not recognize any occupied territories as part of Russia under a potential future peace agreement with Moscow. &quot;The American side goes into details. For example, the city of Enerhodar... You can&apos;t just say: here&apos;s the (Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power) Plant, and the city is separate. I believe that the issue of territories is the most difficult one after the issue of establishing a ceasefire,&quot; Zelensky said. Control over the nuclear plant in occupied Enerhodar was discussed during U.S.-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia, U.S. President Donald Trump said.

Russian missile attack on Kryvyi Rih injures at least 4	Russian troops attacked a residential area in Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast with ballistic missiles injuring at least four people, Governor Serhii Lysak said. Explosions in Kryvyi Rih were reported almost immediately after the Air Force said on March 14 that Russia had launched missiles. Photos published on social media show a building severely damaged by the Russian attack. The consequences of the attack are yet to be determined. Emergency service workers are currently working on site, Lysak said. Last week, Russia struck a hotel in Kryvyi Rih, killing six people and injuring over 30 others, including children. Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of President Volodymyr Zelensky, remains a frequent target of Russian missile attacks. With a population of about 660,000, it is the second-largest city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, located roughly 70 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of the nearest front line.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-on-kryvyi-rih-injures-at-least-4/	2025-03-14T12:23:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-14_20-30-28.jpg
Belarus Weekly: Belarus drops out of top 20 global arms exporters list	Russia proposed building a drone factory in Belarus with an annual capacity of 100,000 units. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko appoints new government ahead of his seventh &#x201C;inauguration.&#x201D; Belarus cracks down on the unemployed amid workforce shortages. UN experts urge Belarus to end the incommunicado detention of political prisoner Siarhei Tsikhanouski, after two years of him being hidden from the public eye. Belarus drops out of the top 20 global arms exporters, SIPRI report finds. Russia has proposed to build a drone factory in Belarus capable of producing 100,000 drones every year, the press office of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko reported on March 6. Deputy Head of the Russia Presidential Administration Maxim Oreshkin made the offer during a meeting with Lukashenko at a military exhibition in Minsk, the press office said. The drones will reportedly be built using Russian licenses. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s very important that Belarus has its own (drone) production facilities, which would strengthen both its economy and national security,&#x201D; Oreshkin said. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re ready to build the plant. We guarantee: you wouldn&#x2019;t be able to build it in Russia the way you could build it here,&#x201C; Lukashenko said in response. The announcement does not specify whether the plant will produce military drones. Yury Kozarenko, a member of the Russian delegation, said that drone production in Belarus could contribute billions to Belarus&#x2019;s GDP, as drones are also used in agriculture, logistics, and education. A staunch Kremlin ally, Lukashenko has repeatedly claimed that Belarus needs to prepare for war and adapt to modern warfare. The Belarusian Defense Ministry reported on Nov. 15, 2024, that it was developing military drones domestically. By the end of 2025, the Belarusian military is expected to have &#x201C;a wide range of combat drones,&#x201D; including a 30-kilometer range &#x201C;Chekan-V&#x201D; and &#x201C;Peacemaker&#x201D; with a reported 10 kilogram warhead and a 100 kilometer range, according to the Head of Application and Development of the Unmanned Aerial Systems department of the Belarusian army, Mikhail Bransky. Currently, Russia uses around 100 to 200 Iranian-developed Shahed-type kamikaze drones in its daily attacks on Ukraine, Vadym Skibitskyi, the deputy head of Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence agency (HUR), said on March 3. Russia plans to increase the number of drones and sites from which drones will be launched, he added. Since July 2024, Russian drones have crossed into Belarusian airspace with increasing frequency. Some of them have crashed in the vicinity of residential areas, although so far without causing casualties. Minsk has never publicly objected to Moscow over these incursions, and local authorities tend to conceal incidents and provide no comment. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, not yet officially inaugurated as president following the Jan. 26 sham presidential elections, has appointed a new government, naming Alexander Turchin as the country&#x2019;s new prime minister. Lukashenko began his seventh consecutive term as president amid widespread repressions and in an atmosphere of fear, human rights activists report. The Belarusian autocrat maintained his grip on power by brutally suppressing nationwide protests that engulfed the country following fraudulent 2020 presidential elections. Turchin, the new prime minister, was appointed on March 10, after previously serving as head of the Minsk regional executive committee. He is under EU, U.K., Swiss and Norwegian sanctions over the suppression of mass protests in 2020. Following the appointment, Turchin told reporters that Belarus would not see any &#x201C;significant course correction,&#x201D; adding that his approach would be one of &#x201C;evolution without revolutions.&#x201D; His predecessor, Raman Halouchanka, was transferred to the position of head of the Belarusian National Bank. While announcing the appointment, Lukashenko called for the bank and the government to &#x201C;find common ground&#x201D; in terms of financing the economy. Analysts say the appointment of Halouchanka will weaken the bank&#x2019;s monetary policy, as the former prime minister lacks a background in finance. Lukashenko has previously ordered government interventions in the economy, and was forced to subsidize struggling state-owned enterprises. Inflation risks are mounting, according to Beroc, the country&#x2019;s leading independent economic think tank. In 2024, inflation was reined in to 5.2% with the help of heavy government regulation of consumer goods pricing. If the restrictions were to be relaxed, inflation would accelerate to 6-8%, experts believe. Lukashenko presented the official appointments as the advent of a &#x201C;new generation&#x201D; in Belarusian leadership. However, the government consists largely of the same ministers, except for Uladzimir Karanik, formerly the chairman of one of the Regional Executive Committees, who was appointed deputy prime minister, and Kiryl Zalesky, the former head of the High-Tech Park information technology development initiative, who became minister of informatization. Political analysts do not foresee any real changes, saying that in general, the appointments were an &#x201C;old system masquerading as new.&#x201D; Belarusian authorities are attempting to remedy the country&#x2019;s current labor shortages by targeting the unemployed with a special tax, independent Belarusian media have reported. Belarus in 2015 adopted a Soviet-style decree requiring working-age citizens without formal employment or income to pay an annual fee of about $200. Dubbed &#x201C;the tax on parasitism,&#x201D; the measure sparked mass protests and was suspended in 2017. It came into effect again three years later, replacing the direct tax with the obligation to pay the full cost of household utilities, which are typically subsidized by the government. Currently, the rate is five times higher for those considered &#x201C;parasites.&#x201D; In February 2025, Belarus&#x2019;s Interior Minister Ivan Kubarkov announced raids against &#x201C;deadbeats&#x201D; &#x2014; the working-age citizens who have not been officially employed for a long time, have no declared income, and don&#x2019;t pay taxes. The announcement followed Lukashenko&#x2019;s claim on Jan. 21 that it was necessary to bring more unemployed people back into the labor market. Throughout the first weeks of March, Belarusians in Minsk were summoned en masse to the employment administration and questioned regarding their sources of income. The exiled Belarusian news outlet Nasha Niva reported that summons were delivered even to those who had left the country decades ago. Belarus is grappling with a serious labor shortages: the state jobs database currently lists 188,700 vacant postings, a significant amount for a nation of 9.5 million with an estimated 4-4.5 million workforce. Healthcare alone faces a shortfall of 10,000 workers. Up to 57% of employers in Belarus reported experiencing a shortages of staff, according to the independent research center rabota.by. The Eurasian Development Bank foresees further wage increases in 2025, fueled by competition over scarce labor. The natural aging of the population in Belarus is being exacerbated by the mass emigration of the most economically and politically active population, the economic think tank Beroc reports. By various accounts, between 300,000 and 500,000 Belarusians have left the country since 2020, after that year&#x2019;s fraudulent elections triggered massive protests and a subsequent crackdown on public protests. At the same time, former political prisoners are not being offered jobs, and workers are being dismissed for supporting an opposition candidate in 2020. On March 3, Lukashenko reiterated his demand that people who participated in protests should not be hired, slamming them as &#x201C;the enemies of the state.&#x201D; Sixteen United Nations human rights experts issued a statement on March 7 demanding that the Belarusian authorities disclose the fate and whereabouts of former presidential candidate and political prisoner Siarhei Tsikhanouski. The jailed activist, who sought to challenge Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko in the 2020 presidential elections, has been held incommunicado for the past two years. Among Belarus&#x2019;s 1,200 political prisoners, nine leaders of the 2020 pro-democracy movement remain fully isolated from the outside world in what&#x2019;s known as an incommunicado regime. The human rights community considers the regime to be a form of enforced disappearance that amounts to torture.

(Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images)The UN experts, including Chair-Rapporteur of the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances Gabriella Citroni, Special Rapporteur on Belarus Nils Mui&#x17E;nieks, along with other experts, urged Belarus to enable contact to be restored with Tsikhanouski and other opposition leaders, such as Mikalai Statkevich, Viktar Babaryka, Maria Kalesnikava and Maksim Znak. &#x201C;The enforced disappearance of Mr. Tsikhanouski and others is a blatant violation of international law,&#x201D; the experts said. &#x201C;These actions seek to silence political opposition and instill fear.&#x201D; While acknowledging that there had been releases of political prisoners in Belarus recently, the experts noted that these had been selective and came with conditions to cooperate with law enforcement and propaganda. Blogger and entrepreneur Siarhei Tsikhanouski is serving a nineteen-and-a-half year term in prison. Arrested in May 2020, two months before the election, he was charged with obstructing the public&#x2019;s electoral rights, organizing riots, and inciting hatred. While in prison he was given an additional 18-month sentence for allegedly disobeying the penal colony administration. His lawyers and family have not received any information about him since March 2023. Belarus has dropped out of the world&#x2019;s top-20 arms exporters, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) published on March 10. Shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Belarus quickly became a major arms exporter, ranking 11th globally. Between 1999 and 2006, the country reportedly earned an estimated $1 billion by selling off the arsenal it inherited from the collapsed empire, prompting the U.S. Congress to pass a motion, which required annual reporting on Belarusian arms exports. Belarus had remained in the 20th position since 2019 despite a 37% decline in exports. Meanwhile, its arms imports, coming exclusively from Russia, grew by a third. In recent years, Serbia, Vietnam, and Uganda have been the top buyers of Belarusian weapons. Belarusian arms deals have drawn scrutiny, with multiple media investigations conducted into Lukashenko&#x2019;s close circle of businessmen, Alexander Zingman and Oleg Vodchits, for facilitating arms sales to African countries. On March 7, the head of the military government of Myanmar, Min Aung Hlaing, was in Minsk to discuss arms supplies, the exiled Myanmar Mizzima News Media reported. Belarus backed Russia in its aggression against Ukraine but has abstained from sending its troops to the battlefield. Experts attribute Lukashenko&#x2019;s reluctance to an overwhelming anti-war consensus domestically, which might cause massive unrest in Belarus while not providing much help to Russia on the front line.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-belarus-drops-out-of-the-top-20-global-arms-exporters/	2025-03-14T12:13:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204444160.jpg
Ukraine, US discuss fate of Russian-occupied territories, Zelensky says	The fate of Ukraine&apos;s Russian-occupied territories was discussed with the U.S. during the talks in Saudi Arabia earlier this week, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on March 14.

Control over the nuclear plant in occupied Enerhodar was discussed during U.S.-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia, U.S. President Donald Trump said. The largest nuclear plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in the city of Enerhodar, has been under Russian occupation since 2022. While the facility remains under Russian control, it is not currently generating electricity. Ukraine and its allies have repeatedly urged Russia to withdraw its troops from the plant. Throughout its occupation, the plant has been repeatedly disconnected from the Ukrainian power grid due to Russian attacks on the country&apos;s energy infrastructure. Russian forces currently occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine, from where reports of systematic repression, torture, and forced deportations regularly emerge.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-us-discusses-ter/	2025-03-14T12:07:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204348100.jpg
Conditions for Ukraine's surrender' — Why Putin's demands for ceasefire make no sense	Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s conditions for a ceasefire are unrealistic and tantamount to demanding that Ukraine disarm itself and surrender, analysts say. Putin said on March 13 that Russia was ready to agree to the U.S.-backed 30-day-long ceasefire in Ukraine but then followed by listing a number of demands &#x2014; a ban on Ukrainian mobilization or training of troops and a halt on Western military aid for Kyiv. Putin also hinted that Ukrainian troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast must surrender. Later the same day, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s envoy, Steve Witkoff, met Putin in Moscow. Trump reacted by saying on March 14, &quot;We had very good and productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia yesterday, and there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end.&quot; &quot;It appears that Putin pretends to accept a ceasefire in principle, in order not to be criticized for being obstructive, but demands concessions as a precondition,&quot; Richard Betts, professor emeritus of war and peace studies at Columbia University, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;This is consistent with his previous demands that Ukraine must agree to concessions before Russia negotiates with it. In short, Putin appears to view negotiations for a peace agreement not as a bargaining process but as a process for arranging the conditions of Ukraine&apos;s surrender.&quot; Peter Rough, a senior fellow at Hudson Institute, argued that &quot;Putin can&apos;t afford to say no to Trump altogether but will add a series of conditions.&quot; &quot;Putin may not be able to take Kyiv in this round of war, but he may be able to get the Donbas, and he will try to apply the Georgia model of hybrid war to take Kyiv later,&quot; he said. &quot;His response to the ceasefire proposal is only the first in a series of counter-proposals to achieve that goal. The bottom line is he hasn&apos;t changed his goal of subsuming Ukraine.&quot; William Wohlforth, a professor focusing on international relations at Dartmouth College, also said that &quot;Putin&apos;s highly conditional &apos;unconditional&apos; acceptance of the &apos;idea&apos; of a ceasefire is meant to play for time and see how much pressure the Trump administration is willing to exert, and on whom, to make progress.&quot; &quot;To me, Putin&apos;s comments in response to the ceasefire idea suggest a desire to sustain momentum in the improvement in relations with the Trump administration while at the same time not saying anything that would compromise his larger political objective with respect to Ukraine,&quot; he added. Putin said, &quot;We agree with the proposals to cease hostilities, but they must lead to long-term peace and address the root causes of the crisis.&quot; Bettina Renz, a professor of international security at Nottingham University and the author of the book &quot;Russia&apos;s Military Revival,&quot; argued that &quot;his demand that the &apos;root causes&apos; of the war need to be addressed as a precondition for the ceasefire agreement is particularly concerning.&quot; &quot;Thinking back to February 2022, the &apos;root causes&apos; of and justifications for the invasion listed by the Kremlin were sweeping and included, amongst other things, NATO enlargement since the 1990s, a denial of the legitimacy of the democratically elected Ukrainian government, and the &apos;militarisation&apos; of Ukraine,&quot; she said. &quot;If addressing these &apos;root causes&apos; in Russia&apos;s favor is a precondition for a 30-day ceasefire agreement in the Kremlin&apos;s eyes, this is clearly unreasonable and unrealistic. At this point, it looks like the Kremlin will be prepared to agree to a ceasefire only under conditions that are ideal for Russia.&quot; Putin also claimed that Russian troops were &quot;advancing on almost all sections of the front line.&quot; &quot;Conditions are also being created there for us to encircle and block entire fairly large enemy units,&quot; he said. &quot;How will these 30 days be used? Will forced mobilization continue in Ukraine? Will weapons be supplied there? Will newly mobilized units undergo training? Or will none of this happen?&quot; Putin&apos;s claims about Russia&apos;s all-around advances were false. Russia has been on the offensive in Donetsk Oblast since 2023. However, in recent months, its advance has slowed down in many areas, with Ukraine even conducting counteroffensives near the towns of Pokrovsk and Toretsk. The Kremlin&apos;s only major success in recent weeks was Ukraine&apos;s withdrawal from a part of Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast as Russian troops cut off logistical routes in the region. Putin&apos;s demand that Ukraine should stop mobilization and training and should not receive Western military aid does not make any sense and will not be accepted by Kyiv, experts say. &quot;Of course, Ukraine won&apos;t put limits on its own military forces. That would be suicidal,&quot; Rough said. &quot;It also won&apos;t stop asking for and receiving weapons from the West. That would be suicidal as well. These are non-starters, and even Putin must understand that.&quot; Stefan Wolff, professor of international security at the University of Birmingham, told the Kyiv Independent that Putin &quot;wants a weak Ukraine that is unable to defend itself and has no ability to resist Russian pressure.&quot; &quot;The sooner he achieves that, the more likely it is that he can impose his own conditions,&quot; he added. &quot;Part of his original war aims was the demilitarization of Ukraine, and part of this is depriving Ukraine of Western military support.&quot; Renz argued that &quot;Putin&apos;s concerns over Ukraine using a 30-day ceasefire to regroup and rearm, and over the difficulties of monitoring such a ceasefire, refer to limitations affecting any ceasefire agreement.&quot; &quot;Ceasefire agreements are always merely a first step in the cessation of armed conflict and a compromise, and their success can never be guaranteed,&quot; she added. &quot;Clearly, the Ukrainian leadership has similar concerns about a ceasefire agreement with Russia. However, in comparison to the Kremlin, the Ukrainian leadership willingly expressed the readiness to accept a ceasefire despite these risks.&quot; Volodymyr Ariev, a member of parliament from the opposition European Solidarity party, told the Kyiv Independent that Ukraine could put forward counter-demands. For example, Kyiv could say that Russia should stop transporting extra military equipment to Ukraine and recruiting soldiers for its war effort, he added. Putin also claimed that &quot;in the coming days, a physical blockade (of Ukrainian troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast) will take place, meaning that no one will be able to leave at all.&quot; &quot;There will only be two options &#x2014; surrender or perish,&quot; he said. &quot;If we cease hostilities for 30 days, what does that mean? That everyone there will be allowed to leave without a fight? Are we supposed to let them go after they have committed numerous crimes against civilians?&quot; No evidence has been provided for Putin&apos;s claim about alleged Ukrainian war crimes in Kursk Oblast, and there is no independent confirmation that Ukrainian troops are at risk of being blockaded. Everything that Putin said is either false or has no immediate confirmation. However, Trump has picked up some of the claims. On March 14, he urged Putin to &quot;spare&quot; the allegedly surrounded Ukrainian troops. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff denied Trump&apos;s claim that Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast were surrounded. Wolff said that Putin &quot;clearly wants the troops out to deprive Ukraine of a critical bargaining chip (Kursk Oblast), but he also would probably prefer taking as many of them as prisoners rather than allowing them to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s front lines elsewhere.&quot; &quot;Perhaps Putin would have been more pliable if these negotiations had happened at some other time,&quot; a Russian author living in exile who asked to remain anonymous out of security concerns told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;But now, against the backdrop of the events in the Kursk region and the latest statements and steps of the Trump administration, he seems to have only become more confident of his future impunity.&quot; Putin also raised the question of how violations of the ceasefire would be monitored and how the ceasefire would be enforced. Ukraine has also called for resolving this issue and suggested that European peacekeepers be deployed to enforce the ceasefire. However, the Kremlin has rejected the deployment of Western peacekeepers. Wolff argued that it &quot;makes sense from the Kremlin&apos;s perspective to ask for &apos;neutral&apos; observers because it weakens any potential security guarantees that Ukraine could get from having Western peacekeepers deployed.&quot; &quot;Putin&apos;s statement on the ceasefire proposal does not suggest readiness for peace, or at least not for a peace that would involve any kind of compromise from the Russian side,&quot; Renz said.

Ukraine, EU move to deepen cybersecurity cooperation as Russian threat rises	Ukraine and the EU took steps to deepen cooperation in cybersecurity as Russian hybrid attacks aiming to undermine support for Kyiv and flame tensions across the continent continue to rise. Ukraine and Europe&#x2019;s cybersecurity agencies signed a memorandum of understanding at the Kyiv International Cyber Resilience Forum this week to support joint research, innovation, and EU-funded projects in cross-border cybersecurity projects. The European Cybersecurity Competence Center, which is responsible for Europe&apos;s cybersecurity development, manages billions in EU funding through the Digital Europe and Horizon Europe programs. While Ukraine faces participation restrictions as a non-EU member, Kyiv hopes the memorandum will kickstart bringing the two even closer together in the field of cybersecurity. &quot;We expect that we will be able to involve Ukrainian businesses in these support programs, enabling them to interact more effectively with European businesses and develop together,&quot; Serhii Prokopenko, deputy head of cybersecurity at Ukraine&apos;s Security and Defense Council, told the Kyiv Independent. Russian hybrid operations in Europe are becoming more frequent and aggressive, especially since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, the EBU Investigative Journalism Network recently reported, citing 20 government, military, and intelligence officials from 10 countries. &#x201C;We see an increased Russian risk appetite &#x2014; and when I say risk, I mean not risk to them; risk to us, risk to our economies, to the safety of our citizens,&#x201D; NATO Deputy Assistant Secretary General for Innovation, Hybrid, and Cyber James Appathurai told EBU. Russian cyber and hybrid attacks on Ukraine in the rear, that is, beyond the battlefield, as well as against European partners to undermine support for Kyiv, &#x201C;are (from) the same threat actors, so technical exchange allows us to plan together,&quot; said Prokopenko. Prokopenko told the Kyiv Independent that he met with ECCC Director Luca Tagliaretti and agreed to coordinate a working plan soon. &quot;The memorandum serves as a framework agreement enabling both sides to begin practical cooperation,&quot; said Prokopenko. He also hopes Ukrainian government institutions, universities, and businesses will be able to participate in the programs made available through EU funding. The EU&apos;s Cyber Solidarity Act is currently enlisting companies for incident response, which Ukrainian firms are hoping to join. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s rapid development of military tech and artificial intelligence, all these innovative things emerging in Ukraine against the backdrop of the war, are also of interest to Europeans, and we will also interact with them in this direction,&quot; he said. In November 2023, Ukraine signed an agreement with the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity. The agreement required special approval from the European Commission as it was the first time the ENISA engaged with a non-EU country. &quot;This demonstrates that Europe is expecting us, that we&apos;re intensifying and deepening cooperation. While we cannot yet become a full member, we&apos;re already being seen as future members, and then we won&apos;t need to go through this stage,&quot; Serhii Prokopenko said. As part of the agreement, Ukraine now collaborates with ENISA on cybersecurity threats, regularly meeting with the European side to exchange threat analytics. Serhii Prokopenko, deputy head of cybersecurity at Ukraine&apos;s Security and Defense Council, at the Kyiv International Cyber Resilience Forum 2025 in Kyiv, Ukraine on March 11, 2025. (Kyiv International Cyber Resilience Forum)A key aspect of this partnership is aligning Ukrainian legislation with the NIS 2 Directive, which regulates cybersecurity across Europe. Prokopenko describes it as &quot;a complex law,&quot; whose norms partners are currently helping Ukraine to &quot;properly interpret.&quot; As part of its EU accession process, Ukraine is updating its 2021 cybersecurity strategy to align with European standards. &quot;As EU candidates, we will adopt European best practices and develop a new strategy taking these requirements into account because we are EU candidates, and we must comply,&quot; Serhii Prokopenko said. Ukraine&#x2019;s cybersecurity agency is in the process of auditing its current strategies, but Prokopenko expects that Ukraine will have a draft of the new strategy aligned with European standards within this year or next. Ukraine is also working on establishing cyber troops, according to Prokopenko. Several draft laws in Ukraine&apos;s parliament propose the creation of dedicated cyber military units, with the most likely scenario placing them within the armed forces. Plans to create Cyber Forces existed before the full-scale war, but priorities shifted due to Russia&apos;s invasion. &quot;Everything already exists, but we need legal status,&quot; Prokopenko said. Besides protecting critical infrastructure, cyber troops would conduct offensive or counter-offensive cyber operations. Currently, only Ukraine&apos;s Defense Intelligence Forces officially acknowledge conducting cyber attacks, periodically publishing information about attacks on infrastructure in Russia. Prokopenko says that European practices will help protect Ukrainian infrastructure from Russian hacker attacks. &quot;Critical infrastructure consists of IT, office networks, and industrial networks that interact with sensors and control technological processes. For IT, the general approaches are more or less the same for everyone. Still, for specific systems, such as in energy or water supply, specific protocols and steps are prescribed for rapid detection and effective threat response,&quot; he said. Under an earlier cybersecurity strategy, Ukraine anticipated the Russian threat but focused on deterrence, said Prokopenko. &quot;We are now in an active phase of war and, accordingly, we need to conduct more active operations,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-eu-look-to-deepen-cybersecurity-cooperation-as-russian-threat-rises/	2025-03-14T11:07:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/1-118.jpg
Ukraine troops in Kursk Oblast must surrender, Putin claims	Russian President Vladimir Putin said on March 14 that Ukrainian soldiers must surrender in Kursk Oblast after U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s request to &quot;spare&quot; the troops he claimed are surrounded. The General Staff said that Ukrainian units &quot;have regrouped, moved to more favorable defense lines, and are completing their assigned tasks&quot; in Kursk Oblast. Speaking during a meeting of Russia&apos;s Security Council, Putin claimed that some Ukrainian troops &quot;are blocked&quot; in the embattled Russian region. &quot;In order to effectively implement the U.S. president&apos;s call, an appropriate order from Ukraine&apos;s military and political leadership to its military units is necessary,&quot; Putin said. The Russian president claimed that Moscow &quot;will guarantee life and decent treatment in accordance with international law&quot; to captured Ukrainian soldiers. This claim is at odds with reports about Russia&apos;s treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs). There have been multiple accounts of Ukrainian POWs being tortured or killed while in Russian captivity. The POWs that returned from Russian captivity as part of prisoner exchanges required medical attention after facing food deprivation and beatings by Russian prison guards. A Ukrainian soldier who was previously held captive by Russian forces shows a picture of himself prior to captivity while undergoing rehabilitation in an undisclosed location in Ukraine on June 6, 2024. (Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)As of mid-December 2024, Kyiv has also found that 177 captured Ukrainian soldiers were executed on the spot while attempting to surrender. Instances of summary executions have been reported in Kursk Oblast as well. President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on March 14 that the Kursk operation &quot;has completed its task.&quot; He said that Ukraine was able to stabilize the situation near Pokrovsk as well. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi acknowledged on March 12 the &quot;difficult situation&quot; in the region but said that Ukraine will hold the defenses &quot;as long as reasonable and necessary.&quot; Ukraine launched the cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially seizing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. Since then, Russian forces, reinforced by North Korean troops, have steadily pushed back against Ukrainian forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-troops-in-kursk-oblast-must-surrender-putin-claims/	2025-03-14T10:59:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202844124.jpg
EU resists pressure from Hungary, extends Russia sanctions	The European Union has reached a deal with Hungary to renew sanctions on more than 2,400 primarily Russian entities and individuals hours before they were set to expire on March 15, an EU official with knowledge of the negotiations told the Kyiv independent. The EU had been braced for a standoff over the issue, just the latest diplomatic tussle between the largely pro-Ukraine bloc, and its most pro-Kremlin member. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has repeatedly opposed military aid for Ukraine and warned that Ukraine&apos;s EU membership would &quot;destroy&quot; Hungary. He has maintained ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin despite Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, amplifying Kremlin narratives in Europe. In exchange for Hungary lifting its veto, the EU on March 14 agreed to remove four individuals from the list, fewer than half the initial number demanded by Budapest. &quot;We know very well that our sanctions are working. They are biting and crippling the Russian economy,&quot; Anita Hipper, EU spokesperson for foreign affairs said following the renewal. &quot;And this is exactly the intended effect, because what we want to achieve with this is to ensure that Ukraine is strong and Russia doesn&apos;t have the money and the fuel to put in its war machine.&quot; The sanctions list, renewed for another six months, includes Putin, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, as well as members of the Russian State Duma and individuals responsible for sham elections and referenda in occupied Ukrainian territories. Individuals involved in the kidnapping and forced adoption of Ukrainian children, the atrocities in Bucha and Mariupol, as well as high-ranking officials, military personnel and Wagner group commanders are also among the 2,400 individuals and entities on the list. Hungary had demanded that five more individuals be removed from the list but folded on those demands following extensive negotiations with EU officials. Russian billionaires and businessmen Mikhail Fridman (L) and Petr Aven (R) pictured in Moscow, Russia, on March 16, 2017 (Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images)Mikhail FridmanOligarch Mikhail Fridman&#x2019;s removal had been high on Hungary&#x2019;s list of demands. Budapest&#x2019;s Ambassador to the EU had explicitly stated that removing Fridman, one of Russia&#x2019;s longest standing oligarchs, was a condition for lifting Hungary&#x2019;s veto. Despite this, he remains sanctioned. Fridman has &quot;cultivated close ties with Putin,&quot; according to the French sanctions register, and &quot;he is cited among Russia&#x2019;s biggest financiers and as a facilitator in Putin&#x2019;s inner circle.&quot; Investigative reporters revealed in May 2023 that Alfa Insurance, a subsidiary of Alfa-Bank owned by Fridman and Petr Aven, provided insurance for vehicles used by Russian forces in Ukraine. The company has also reportedly serviced the Main Office of Special Programs, which is responsible for guarding Russian President Vladimir Putin. Fridman also remains sanctioned by the U.S. and the U.K. Fridman and Aven had previously sold their stakes in Alfa-Bank and its insurance division in an effort to overturn the sanctions, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Feb. 6. A close associate of Fridman, Petr Aven was also on Hungary&#x2019;s wishlist. Aven is accused by the UK, France and Switzerland of &quot;destabilising or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.&quot; According to the Swiss sanctions registry, Aven is &quot;one of approximately 50 wealthy Russian businesspersons who regularly meet with Putin in the Kremlin.&quot; He is accused of taking directives from Putin and implementing his foreign policy agenda. &quot;Aven and his business partner Mikhail Fridman have been engaged in the Kremlin&#x2019;s efforts to lift the Western sanctions issued to counter Russian aggressive policy against Ukraine,&quot; it adds. Like Fridman, he is also sanctioned by the U.S. and the U.K. Hungary also wanted oligarch Alisher Usmanov to be delisted alongside his sister, Gulbakhor Ismailova, who was taken off the list. The Russian-Uzbek businessman made his fortune in metal and mining operations after the fall of the Soviet Union. Usmanov &quot;is associated with individuals within the government of Russia who are involved in destabilising and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine,&quot; according to the U.K.&#x2019;s sanctions list. France also says that Usmanov &quot;provided active material or financial support to Russian decision-makers responsible for the annexation of Crimea and the destabilisation of Ukraine.&quot; Usmanov also remains sanctioned by the U.S. and the U.K. Alisher Usmanov&apos;s super-yacht Dilbar is pulled into a covered floating dock of Luerssen shipyards on the Weser river at the harbour of Bremen on September 23, 2022 (Focke Strangmann/AFP via Getty Images)Dmitry MazepinHungary also sided with Dmitry Mazepin, who EU judges described as &quot;a member of the closest circle of President Putin.&quot; He founded Uralchem Group, which is &quot;one of the world&apos;s largest producers and exporters of nitrogen, potash and complex fertilizers,&quot; according to Forbes. EU court documents state that &quot;he is one of the leading businesspersons involved in economic sectors providing a substantial source of revenue to the Government of Russia.&quot; Mazepin is also sanctioned by the U.K. Finally, Hungarian officials went to bat for Musa Bazhaev. Sanctioned by the EU and the U.K, Bazhaev is among the top 200 richest people in Russia and through his business operations as head of the Alliance group is deemed to be &quot;providing a substantial source of revenue&quot; to the Russian government. Bazhaev had challenged the EU&#x2019;s sanctions against him but his case was rejected by the EU&#x2019;s General Court. Russia&#x2019;s sport minister since May 2024, Degtyaryov will be delisted as part of the deal reached between Brussels and Budapest. Degtaryov was involved in &quot;the inauguration of the de facto embassy of the unrecognised so-called Donetsk People&#x2019;s Republic in Moscow, and he contributes to undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine,&quot; according to the sanctions placed against him by Switzerland. He remains sanctioned by the U.S. and the U.K. National Olympic Committee Chairman Mikhail Degtyaryov during a signing ceremony at the Grand Kremlin Palace, March 4, 2025, in Moscow, Russia (Contributor/Getty Images)Viatcheslav Moshe KantorAn Israeli-British-Russian businessman, Kantor has been described by the French sanctions register as maintaining &quot;close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin&quot; which have allowed him to &quot;preserve his very large fortune.&quot; As he conducts business in &quot;economic sectors which provide a substantial source of revenue for the Russian government,&quot; he therefore contributes to &quot;destabilizing&quot; Ukraine. Kantor remains sanctioned by the U.K. Ismailova, the sister of Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov, will also be removed from the list at the behest of Hungary. &quot;She relies on a network of shell companies to hide the wealth of her brother,&quot; according to the Swiss sanctions register. Usmanov, who remains on the EU sanctions list &quot;provided active material or financial support to Russian decision-makers responsible for the annexation of Crimea and the destabilisation of Ukraine.&quot; She remains sanctioned by the U.S. and U.K. Separately to the negotiations with Hungary, Russian businessman Vladimir Rashevsky will be removed following his legal challenge against the sanctions being upheld by the European Court of Justice. Three other individuals will be removed as they are now deceased. Hungary withdrawing its veto means these sanctions will be renewed for another six months but another fight between Brussels and Budapest looms. Economic sanctions against Russia, including the freezing of nearly $200 billion in Russian central bank assets, also need to be renewed by the EU in July. &#xA0; As the U.S. signals an openness to easing sanctions against Russia, EU member states worry that Hungary could become emboldened in its dealings with Brussels and block the renewal of economic sanctions. As the EU&#x2019;s most pro-Kremlin member states continue to be a thorn in the bloc&#x2019;s side, other member states are considering moving against Budapest. If a majority of member states agree, Hungary could be stripped of its voting rights, and ability to veto, within the EU. Such a move, though politically difficult, could indicate that EU member states have finally lost patience with Hungary.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-resists-pressure-from-hungary-extends-russia-sanctions-including-those-on-mikhail-fridman/	2025-03-14T10:52:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2198451518.jpg
What Germany under Merz means for Ukraine and Europe, according to expert	Germany braces for major changes as incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz seeks to reshape the country&#x2019;s role on the continent. The Kyiv Independent sat down with J&#xF6;rn Fleck, senior director with the Europe Center at the Atlantic Council, to discuss what the new German government means for Ukraine and beyond. Speaking on Feb. 28, less than five days after Merz&#x2019;s party&apos;s election victory, Fleck saw potential for bolstering Ukraine&#x2019;s war effort and Europe&#x2019;s autonomy but also warned of the rising strength of radical, pro-Russian parties.	https://kyivindependent.com/what-germany-under-merz-means-for-ukraine-and-europe-according-to-expert/	2025-03-14T10:46:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_9408.jpg
Kyiv says Ukrainian troops 'regrouped' in Kursk Oblast, denies encirclement	Ukraine&apos;s General Staff on March 14 denied claims that Ukrainian troops were encircled in Kursk Oblast amid Russia&apos;s ongoing offensive in the region. The General Staff said that Russia had been reporting an alleged encirclement of Ukrainian forces in Kursk Oblast &quot;for political purposes and to put pressure on Ukraine and its partners.&quot; The statement came after U.S. President Donald Trump said that his administration held &quot;productive discussions&quot; with Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 13, during which he urged him to &quot;spare&quot; surrounded Ukrainian troops. &quot;At this very moment, thousands of Ukrainian troops are completely surrounded by the Russian military, and in a very bad and vulnerable position,&quot; Trump wrote, without providing any evidence. Speaking on March 13 about a U.S.-backed 30-day ceasefire, Putin claimed that the ceasfire would be beneficial to Kyiv given the situation in Kursk Oblast. He did not rule out a &quot;complete physical blockade&quot; of Ukrainian troops. &quot;The units have regrouped, moved to more favorable defense lines and are completing their assigned tasks in Kursk Oblast,&quot; the General Staff said. &quot;There is no threat of encirclement of our units.&quot; &quot;Our soldiers are repelling the enemy&apos;s offensive and inflicting effective fire damage from all types of weapons.&quot; Moscow claimed on March 12 to have retaken over 86% of seized territories in the region, including a key town of Sudzha, captured by Ukrainian troops at the start of the Kursk incursion in August 2024. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi acknowledged on March 12 the &quot;difficult situation&quot; in the region but said that Ukraine will hold the defenses &quot;as long as reasonable and necessary.&quot; Ukraine launched the cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially seizing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory.

Man suspected of murdering prominent Odesa activist detained, authorities say	Hours after prominent Ukrainian activist Demyan Hanul was gunned down in Odesa, law enforcement detained a potential suspect. Hanul, 31, was a well-known public figure, blogger, and founder of the Street Front NGO. He participated in the EuroMaidan Revolution and the May 2 clashes against pro-Russian forces in Odesa. The activist had been active in rallies supporting Ukraine, charity fundraisers for the military, and campaigns to dismantle the city&apos;s Soviet and imperial monuments. He was shot dead in central Odesa on March 14. Following the murder, the shooter fled the scene. According to Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko, a weapon that was allegedly used was found in the apartment where the detainee was hiding. The suspect is allegedly a 46-year-old deserter, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed. In reaction to the murder, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that dozens of law enforcement officials are involved in the investigation. &quot;I have instructed the interior minister, the head of the Security Service, the acting prosecutor general to throw all the necessary forces and means to establish all the facts,&quot; Zelensky said. The SBU did not rule out Russia&apos;s involvement in the murder. Hanul had previously reported threats against his life. In July 2024, he claimed Russian sources had leaked personal information about his relatives and that a $10,000 bounty was offered for an attack on him.	https://kyivindependent.com/suspect-in-murder-of-prominent-ukrainian-activist-detained-in-odesa/	2025-03-14T08:20:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-14_16-12-59.jpg
Russia using cryptocurrency in oil trade with China, India to bypass sanctions, Reuters reports	Russia has begun using cryptocurrencies in oil transactions with China and India to circumvent Western sanctions, Reuters reported on March 14, citing four sources familiar with the matter. The cryptocurrency scheme currently represents a small fraction of Russia&apos;s $192 billion annual oil trade, according to the International Energy Agency, but its usage is reportedly increasing. According to the report, Chinese and Indian buyers of Russian oil pay intermediary trading firms in yuan or rupees. The funds are then deposited into offshore accounts, converted into Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Tether stablecoins, and withdrawn to another account before being exchanged for rubles in Russia. Reuters&apos; sources suggested that Russia will likely continue using digital currencies in energy trade even if Western sanctions are lifted, citing the speed and flexibility of cryptocurrency transactions. Meanwhile, China&apos;s state-owned oil companies are reportedly reducing purchases of Russian crude due to concerns over U.S. sanctions, Reuters reported, citing industry sources. The move comes as the Trump administration on March 13 declined to renew an exemption that previously allowed Russian banks to access U.S. payment systems for energy transactions. The decision is expected to complicate Russian oil purchases and could contribute to higher global energy prices.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-using-cryptocurrency-in-oil-trade-with-china-india-to-bypass-sanctions-reuters-reports/	2025-03-14T07:28:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1259096903.jpg
Trump claims he asked Putin to 'spare thousands of surrounded Ukrainian troops' in Kursk Oblast	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. President Donald Trump said his administration held &quot;productive discussions&quot; with Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which he urged him to &quot;spare&quot; surrounded Ukrainian troops, he wrote in a Truth Social post on March 14. &quot;At this very moment, thousands of Ukrainian troops are completely surrounded by the Russian military, and in a very bad and vulnerable position,&quot; Trump wrote. &quot;I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II. God bless them all.&quot; The statement comes as Trump&apos;s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, arrived in Moscow on March 13 and met with Putin late in the evening, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-claims-he-asked-putin-to-spare-surrounded-ukrainian-troops/	2025-03-14T07:00:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2177668198.jpg
Ukraine forming team to develop monitoring mechanisms for potential 30-day ceasefire, FM Sybiha says	Ukraine has begun assembling a team to develop monitoring mechanisms for a possible 30-day ceasefire, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on March 14. &quot;We have already started forming a national team to develop appropriate processes to properly control a possible ceasefire. This is an extremely complex process,&quot; Sybiha said at a press conference with Austrian Foreign Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger in Kyiv. Kyiv agreed to the U.S.-proposed truce during talks in Jeddah on March 11, contingent on Russian adherence. The talks also led to Washington resuming military and intelligence support for Ukraine. Sybiha said that upon returning from Jeddah, Ukrainian officials briefed President Volodymyr Zelensky on the discussions. He emphasized that Ukraine&#x2019;s 1,300-kilometer (800-mile) front line presents logistical challenges for ceasefire enforcement. Ukraine remains wary of Russian violations, citing its experience with the Minsk agreements, which Russia breached 25 times. &quot;So now everything will be aimed at ensuring that the Ukrainian side is ready with the appropriate teams, developments, and modalities,&quot; Sybiha said. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on March 13 that Moscow is prepared to accept the ceasefire but demanded that Ukraine halt mobilization, military training, and foreign military aid deliveries during the truce. Trump called Putin&apos;s remarks &quot;very promising&quot; but &quot;not complete,&quot; adding that he is open to meeting with the Russian leader. Zelensky dismissed Putin&#x2019;s response as &quot;manipulative,&quot; warning that Russia is preparing to reject the ceasefire. &quot;Now we have all heard very predictable, very manipulative words from Putin in response to the idea of silence at the front &#x2014; he is, in fact, preparing to reject it as of now,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address on March 13. Russia has sent &quot;additional signals&quot; to Trump regarding the ceasefire through special envoy Steve Witkoff, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on March 14.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-forming-team-to-monitor-potential-30-day-ceasefire-fm-sybiha-says/	2025-03-14T06:54:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197755028.jpg
Chinese state oil firms cut Russian crude purchases over sanctions fears, Reuters reports	China&apos;s state-owned oil companies are scaling back purchases of Russian crude due to concerns over U.S. sanctions, Reuters reported on March 14, citing industry sources. Chinese firms have avoided buying oil from suppliers directly hit by sanctions. &quot;They are taking a break for now while contemplating if there are ways to work around,&quot; a source told Reuters. Russia remains China&apos;s largest crude supplier, accounting for 20% of its total imports. While Beijing has strengthened economic ties with Moscow since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it has repeatedly denied allegations of directly supporting Russia&apos;s war effort. Despite China&apos;s deepening trade relationship with Russia, growing economic pressure has led many Chinese financial institutions to scale back dealings with Moscow, fearing secondary U.S. sanctions. China&apos;s state-run Sinopec and Zhenhua Oil have halted supplies entirely, while PetroChina and CNOOC have continued shipments in March but with reduced volumes, according to sources familiar with the matter. A Sinopec source said the company stopped purchasing Russian oil as it conducted additional checks on compliance with U.S. sanctions and awaits a &quot;clear picture&quot; of ongoing U.S.-Russia negotiations on ending the war in Ukraine. The company may resume supplies if talks lead to an easing or lifting of sanctions. PetroChina, a key buyer of Russia&apos;s ESPO (BCTO) crude from Russia&apos;s state energy company Rosneft, continued offshore shipments in March but at lower volumes, sources told Reuters. CNOOC, another major buyer, also reduced its shipments. In one of his final acts in office, former U.S. President Joe Biden imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia&apos;s energy sector on Jan. 10, targeting Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegaz; over 180 oil tankers transporting crude from Russia, Iran, and Venezuela; and insurance firms involved in Russian oil logistics.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinese-state-oil-firms-cut-russian-crude-purchases-over-us-sanctions-fears-reuters-reports/	2025-03-14T06:24:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1258888534.jpeg
Belarus will not merge with Russia in the near future, Lukashenko says	Belarus will not formally merge with Russia in the near future, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko said on March 14 while addressing the Russian Federation Council. &quot;If we are going to burst through this open door, we will ruin everything we have done. It is necessary to go calmly, step by step,&quot; Lukashenko said. In early January, independent Russian media Meduza reported, citing sources close to the Kremlin, that Putin may revisit plans to formally absorb Belarus once the war against Ukraine is resolved. Despite his claim of maintaining relations with a range og global actors including China, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the EU, Lukashenko said that Minsk will &quot;always side with Moscow.&quot; &quot;It can&apos;t be otherwise. Belarus will never leave Russia alone, just as Russia will never leave Belarus,&quot; he added, highlighting what he described as &quot;open fraternal relations&quot; between the two countries. Lukashenko&apos;s visit to Russia marks his first trip since securing a seventh presidential term in an election widely denounced as a sham. On March 13, he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Following their talks, Lukashenko and Putin signed a joint statement pledging to expand bilateral trade, economic, and investment cooperation. Belarus has been largely cut off from the West following Lukashenko&apos;s violent crackdown on mass protests in 2020 against fraudulent election results. Since then, his regime has further curtailed political freedoms and deepened its alignment with Moscow, providing logistical and military support for Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Even before launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin reportedly had devised a plan for the &quot;creeping annexation&quot; of Belarus by 2030. The plan outlined steps for &quot;harmonizing&quot; Russian and Belarusian laws, &quot;coordinated foreign and defense policy,&quot; and economic integration based on Russian interests. President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on Feb. 14 that Russia is once again building up troops in Belarus, possibly in preparation for large-scale operations against NATO countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-will-not-merge-with-russia-in-the-near-future-lukashenko-says/	2025-03-14T05:15:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204325998-1.jpg
Ukraine is the front line in the battle against oligarchic capitalism	The war in Ukraine is not just a fight for national sovereignty &#x2014; it&#x2019;s a battle at the crossroads of a collapsing global order. While Ukrainians heroically resist Russia&#x2019;s brutal invasion, the war has exposed the fractures of an economic system that has, for decades, concentrated wealth, power, and decision-making into the hands of a few. It is a test &#x2014; not only for Ukraine but for the entire world: Will this war be remembered as the moment democracy fought back against authoritarianism, or will it serve as yet another chapter in the story of oligarchs and corporate elites profiting from conflict while ordinary people suffer? For decades, the world has been sliding toward an era of oligarchical capitalism &#x2014; a system where political and economic power is no longer in the hands of democratic institutions but controlled by corporate monopolies, financial empires, and political elites. This war has accelerated that transformation, reshaping global energy markets, financial systems, and military-industrial economies in ways that will be felt for decades. While the world rightly focuses on Ukraine&#x2019;s survival, the war is also a struggle over who will control the global economy of the future. Russia&#x2019;s invasion wasn&#x2019;t just an act of territorial aggression &#x2014; it was a calculated gamble that Western economic dependence on Russian energy would prevent a unified response. It failed. But in the wake of sanctions and military realignments, the war has triggered an economic upheaval that is redrawing global supply chains and financial alliances. Ukraine is at the heart of this transformation. Its vast agricultural exports, industrial base, and newly discovered lithium reserves &#x2014; critical for the future of battery technology &#x2014; make it an economic battleground as much as a military one. The reconstruction of Ukraine will not only require billions in aid but will likely be shaped by the very corporate and financial interests that have long profited from global crises. At the same time, Western oligarchs and corporations are not passive actors in this conflict. While Russian elites seek to maintain their grip on power, Western defense contractors, energy giants, and private financial interests stand to gain massively from this war. The war economy is booming. European nations are re-militarizing at an unprecedented pace. The fossil fuel industry &#x2014; once thought to be in decline &#x2014; is experiencing a resurgence as nations scramble to secure energy independence. The war has also become a proving ground for new forms of digital warfare, surveillance capitalism, and AI-driven propaganda. The world is witnessing, in real time, how information can be weaponized, how financial systems can be leveraged as geopolitical tools, and how war accelerates the use of technologies that may outlast the battlefield. President Volodymyr Zelensky gives an interview to Turkish media after his visit to Ankara, T&#xFC;rkiye, on Feb. 19, 2024. (Mert Gokhankoc/dia images via Getty Images)Governments across the world are expanding surveillance measures, restricting dissent, and consolidating state power in response to the war. While some of these measures are necessary for security, history warns us that emergency powers granted in times of crisis rarely disappear when the crisis ends. The normalization of war economies and mass surveillance risks creating a permanent state of conflict-driven capitalism, where war is not an exception but an ongoing condition of economic and political life. Ukraine is proving to the world that authoritarian aggression can be resisted. But it is also exposing a deeper question: What kind of world will emerge from this war? If the global economic order continues to be dictated by the interests of oligarchs &#x2014; whether Russian, Western, or otherwise&#x2014;then the ideals Ukraine is fighting for will be at risk of being co-opted by the same elite interests that have manipulated wars and crises for centuries. This war must not become another chapter in the long history of wealth consolidation through conflict. Ukraine&#x2019;s fight for sovereignty must be met with an equally urgent fight for economic justice, democratic renewal, and the dismantling of the systems that have allowed oligarchical capitalism to thrive unchecked. If Ukraine&#x2019;s resistance is to mean something beyond its borders, the world must ensure that this is not just a war for survival but a moment that reshapes global power in the interests of people &#x2014; not just corporations, war profiteers, and financial elites. Ukraine&#x2019;s struggle is more than its own. It is a warning to the world &#x2014; and an opportunity to create a different future. The question is whether we will seize it.

How Ukraine’s defense tech is shaping the future of warfare	Geopolitical events over the past three years have forced a rethinking of the global security framework. Ukraine&#x2019;s battlefield has evolved into an innovation lab for modern defense technologies &#x2014; transforming not only how wars are fought but also how peace is secured. Drawing insights from the recent Brave1 Defense Tech Innovations Forum and Ukraine&#x2019;s own hard-won experience since 2014, it&#x2019;s clear: Ukraine is emerging as the epicenter of a defense revolution. In a world where old alliances and institutions struggle to keep pace with new threats, investing in Ukraine&#x2019;s defense technologies is an investment in a safer, more resilient future. Ukraine&#x2019;s reality has shattered the notion that war is a distant or isolated affair. As Ukrainian Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation Oleksandr Bornyakov stated, &#x201C;The world is not safe anymore.&#x201D; The ongoing Russia-Ukraine War has exposed the limitations of traditional security guarantors, such as the UN and NATO. Yet Ukraine&#x2019;s experience suggests that weak or outdated security frameworks only increase vulnerability in the face of hybrid threats from autocratic adversaries. For Europe, the lesson is clear: defense spending is not waste, but rather critical investment in peace and resilience. With looming threats from old rivals like Russia, amid emerging global uncertainty and the weakening of international institutions like the UN and NATO, the need to bolster defensive capabilities has never been greater. Channeling funds into innovative defense technology can transform Europe&#x2019;s security posture from passive crisis response to proactive mitigation. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war is rewriting the rules of modern warfare. On battlefields where conventional systems fall short, rapid innovation has become the only viable answer, with a demand for both new offensive and defensive systems. These evolving needs are driven by three interlocking factors: First, adaptation to small-scale threats. Traditional air defense systems, designed to counter large, fast-moving aircraft, have proven inadequate &#x2014; and too costly &#x2014; against smaller, slower-moving drones. Recognizing this gap, Ukraine has accelerated the development of both kinetic and electronic anti-drone technologies. This is quickly growing into Ukraine&#x2019;s competitive advantage, as few countries have invested as heavily in this area or have real experience in applying such systems. Second, economics of attrition. In a protracted state-vs-state war, attrition is a critical factor. Innovation is focused on maximizing value for money, making low-cost, high-impact solutions like drones the perfect weapon for the 21st century. We are also seeing international producers gradually adapt to this shift toward cost-effective, rapidly deployable solutions. Third, speed of innovation. Whereas typical defense procurement cycles in the EU or U.S. span decades, Ukraine&#x2019;s evolving battlefield demands a more rapid response. According to Ukrainian Armed Forces representatives, any innovation not reaching production within six months risks becoming obsolete.

(Oleksandr Magula/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)The revolution in modern warfare is far from over. While drones have already reshaped the battlefield, their full potential remains untapped until they evolve into fully autonomous, interconnected systems. Three areas are key to this transformation: First, automation. Operating a drone with a human in the loop is no longer as effective or safe, especially in environments saturated with electronic interference and fast-evolving countermeasures. The future lies in autonomous systems that can operate remotely and independently, reducing risks to human operators and improving operational efficiency. Experts predict not only improved control but also the emergence of drone swarms and fleets. Second, standardization. Rapid innovation has given rise to a wide variety of systems, which are often incompatible with one another. By adopting shared standards for new defense technologies, integration within a country&#x2019;s forces and among allies will be much simpler, allowing these innovations to be rolled out more quickly and on a larger scale. Third, interconnection. Drone warfare remains limited by the speed of human decision-making. Overcoming this challenge requires a robust digital infrastructure that connects a variety of systems, enabling them to operate as a single coordinated entity. This is a crucial next step for drone warfare, where Ukraine has the opportunity to outpace not only its enemies but even its allies, becoming a valuable asset for European security. Despite its challenges, Ukraine&#x2019;s defense ecosystem is currently one of the most innovative and agile in Europe. However, Ukrainian startups face significant roadblocks when attempting to export their technologies or partner with international companies and organizations. To fully harness the potential of its defense innovations, Ukraine needs some form of integration into the international security framework. Until recently, the goal was NATO membership. However, in the current volatile geopolitical landscape, alternatives like the proposed European Armed Forces can serve a similar purpose. In any case, if Ukraine maintains its speed of innovation and continues to attract funding into its fledgling defense sector, the country has the opportunity to not only improve its own security but also offer significant export capacity. Projections estimate a production capacity of 4.6 million drones by 2025, more than double the current planned procurement. This growing capacity represents a great opportunity for international investors and strategic partners. However, high-level political decisions from both Ukraine and its allies are needed to fully unlock it. Additionally, Ukraine could expand partnerships with its allies by offering battlefield testing to international partners. &#x201C;Adopted by the Armed Forces of Ukraine&#x201D; is quickly becoming the most valuable seal of quality in the defense industry, creating both technological and economic opportunities for the country going forward.

JD Vance says he would be 'shocked' if Trump agreed to station US nukes in Poland	U.S. Vice President JD Vance has said he would be &quot;shocked&quot; if the White House agreed to a Polish request to deploy American nuclear weapons on its territory as a deterrent against future Russian aggression. &quot;I haven&apos;t talked to the president about that particular issue, but I would be shocked if he was supportive of nuclear weapons extending further east into Europe,&quot; Vance told Fox News on March 13. The statement was in response to a statement from Polish President Andrzej Duda earlier on March 13 who said such a move would be justified given Russia had already taken similar steps by deploying tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus. &quot;The borders of NATO moved east in 1999, so 26 years later, there should also be a shift of the NATO infrastructure east. For me, this is obvious,&quot; Duda said. &quot;Russia did not even hesitate when they were relocating their nuclear weapons into Belarus,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;They didn&apos;t ask anyone&apos;s permission.&quot; Duda said he recently discussed the idea with Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, and hopes to revive a nuclear-sharing proposal that he unsuccessfully presented to former U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration in 2022. The proposal comes amid mounting warnings from Western leaders and intelligence agencies about the possibility of a large-scale war in Europe within the next five years. Russia&apos;s tactical nuclear weapons are designed for use on the battlefield in Europe and Asia and have a more limited range compared to strategic nuclear weapons, which could reach the U.S. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly issued nuclear threats against Ukraine and the West since launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. While those threats have not materialized, concerns persist over Russia&apos;s military ambitions beyond Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/jd-vance-says-he-would-be-shocked-if-trump-agreed-to-station-us-nukes-in-poland/	2025-03-14T04:52:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204115152.jpg
Putin sent 'additional signals' to Trump on ceasefire proposal, Kremlin says	Russia has sent &quot;additional signals&quot; to U.S. President Donald Trump regarding a proposed ceasefire through special envoy Steve Witkoff, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on March 14. Witkoff landed in Moscow on March 13 and met with Russian President Vladimir Putin late in the evening, according to Peskov. Following Witkoff&apos;s report to Trump, Moscow and Washington will discuss potential dates for a phone call between the leaders, he added in comments reported by Russian state media. &quot;Additional information was provided to the Russian side. Through Witkoff, Putin also passed information and additional signals to Trump,&quot; Peskov said. The visit comes as the U.S. seeks Russian agreement on a proposed 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, which Kyiv accepted during talks in Jeddah on March 11. The agreement led Washington to restart military and intelligence support for Ukraine after halting it last week. Putin said on March 13 that Russia is prepared to accept the ceasefire but demanded that Ukraine halt mobilization, military training, and foreign aid deliveries during the truce. Trump called Putin&apos;s remarks &quot;very promising&quot; but said they were &quot;not complete,&quot; addinghe is open to meeting with the Russian leader. President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed Putin&apos;s response as &quot;manipulative&quot; and suggested the Russian president is preparing to reject the proposal. &quot;Now we have all heard very predictable, very manipulative words from Putin in response to the idea of silence at the front &#x2014; he is, in fact, preparing to reject it as of now,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address on March 13. Witkoff previously traveled to Moscow in February to negotiate the release of U.S. teacher Marc Fogel from Russian prison. He claimed he spoke directly with Putin for over three hours during that visit.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-sent-additional-signals-to-trump-through-special-envoy-witkoff-kremlin-spokesperson-says/	2025-03-14T03:51:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204290859.jpg
Ukrainian activist Demyan Hanul shot dead in central Odesa	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story that is being updated. Ukrainian activist Demyan Hanul was shot dead in central Odesa, the National Police reported on March 14. Hanul, 31, was a well-known public figure, blogger, and founder of the Street Front NGO. He participated in the EuroMaidan Revolution and the May 2 clashes against pro-Russian forces in Odesa. The activist had been active in rallies supporting Ukraine, charity fundraisers for the military, and campaigns to dismantle Soviet and imperial monuments. The shooter fled the scene, and police have launched an investigation. Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said he is taking personal control of the case, adding that a top investigative team from the National Police is en route to Odesa. &quot;An investigative team of the best officers has been formed with the central office of the National Police and has already left for Odesa. A regiment of the National Police has also been sent to Odesa,&quot; he said during an hour of questions to the government in the Verkhovna Rada. Pro-Russian media Tipichanya Odesa initially reported that the shooter was a man in military uniform. Klymenko denied this information. &quot;Operatives and police investigators are working to identify the shooter and arrest him,&quot; Klymenko added. Hanul had previously reported threats against his life. In July 2024, he claimed Russian sources had leaked personal information about his relatives and that a $10,000 bounty was offered for an attack on him.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-activist-demyan-hanul-shot-dead-in-central-odesa/	2025-03-14T03:14:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1043773770.jpg
With Putin demanding new concessions for a ceasefire, all eyes are on Trump’s next move	As a U.S. delegation in Moscow worked to hammer out a ceasefire agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader responded by demanding extensive concessions in exchange for a ceasefire deal in Ukraine. So far, Trump has made harsh demands on Ukraine while avoiding putting similar pressure on Russia. Now, attention turns back to Trump as to whether he will continue his trend of appeasement or double down and force Russia to accept a deal. Speaking at a press conference on March 13, Putin demanded guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops nor receive military aid during the proposed 30-day ceasefire, which some experts see as an attempt to prolong negotiations rather than a sincere attempt at peace. Putin&#x2019;s comments came two days after Kyiv agreed to a ceasefire proposed by Washington during talks in Saudi Arabia on the condition that Russia also accept the terms. Putin also said that further talks are needed to prepare for a ceasefire, including a conversation directly with Trump. The delegation in Moscow was headed by Steve Witkoff, Trump&apos;s special envoy to the Middle East, and left in the early hours of March 14.

(Mikhail Klimentyev / Sputnik / AFP via Getty Images)Trump responded that Putin&apos;s statement was &quot;very promising&quot; but &quot;wasn&#x2019;t complete,&quot; adding he is willing to meet with the Russian president. Ahead of the Russian leader&#x2019;s demands, &#x201C;Trump was very clear: Accept this or I am going to get tough on you,&#x201D; John Herbst, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine under George W. Bush, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Trump&apos;s going to look like a world-class fool if he lets Putin get away with saying no to this proposal. Now that doesn&apos;t mean that Trump, therefore, must do something. &#xA0;But there will be serious pressure on him to do something against Russia,&#x201D; he added. One potential response could be increasing sanctions, a move that Senator Lindsey Graham has pushed for in the event that Putin rejects the ceasefire proposal. &#x201C;If Russia refuses (a ceasefire), we should sanction the hell out of them,&#x201D; Graham wrote on X on March 11 after Washington and Kyiv inked their deal. Nothing in Trump&#x2019;s actions since his inauguration in January has indicated any willingness to put pressure on Russia, said Jenny Mathers, a lecturer in international politics at the U.K.&apos;s Aberystwyth University. Trump has escalated pressure on Ukraine by halting military aid and intelligence sharing until a ceasefire deal was signed, demanding Ukraine sign over natural resource rights to the U.S., berating President Volodymyr Zelensky at a meeting in the Oval Office, suspending a Ukrainian refugee program, and ending USAID funding used to rebuild critical infrastructure struck by Russian missiles. In contrast, despite threats of doubling down on Russian sanctions, Russia has largely evaded escalatory pressure from Trump. Whether or not Trump is willing to change this stance is still up in the air. Another question is whether or not Trump will view Russia&#x2019;s new ceasefire demands as a rejection. &#x201C;Trump seems to be in the mindset of viewing any demands from Russia as reasonable rather than insane, and no list of concessions demanded from Ukraine (by Russia) as outrageous,&#x201D; Mathers said. Still, a scenario where Trump responds to Putin rejecting the deal by throwing his support behind Ukraine is &#x201C;not entirely far-fetched,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Trump is notoriously vain and thin-skinned and easily offended. If he decides that Putin is making him look like a fool in the eyes of the world and not showing him respect, then he could lash out. But even if that happens, Trump could change his mind again,&#x201D; Mathers added. &#x201C;Honestly, one of the few constants in the foreign policy of Trump 2.0 is the affinity for Russia.&#x201D; The ceasefire agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine signed on March 11 featured limited details, including a resumption of U.S. weapons and intelligence, the option to extend beyond the 30 days, and a vague admission of American corporations into Ukrainian mining. It doesn&#x2019;t include the preconditions for a ceasefire Putin named last June, which were largely seen as a non-starter and would have been an effective surrender for Ukraine. The demands Putin set included a full withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from four eastern oblasts &#x2013; Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia &#x2013; which Russia does not fully control. Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, on July 31, 2024. (Maxim Shemetov / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)According to Ryhor Nizhnikau, a Russia expert at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, entering peace negotiations may be a delay tactic while Putin furthers his goal of &#x201C;political capitulation&#x201D; from Ukraine. &#x201C;Putin will try to prolong the negotiations, which in the meantime will give him opportunities to definitely further deteriorate or disrupt relations between Washington and Kyiv and Washington and its European allies within the process,&#x201D; said Nizhnikau. Sergei Parkhomenko, a Russian-born columnist and political commentator, agreed that Putin may choose to engage in &#x201C;long, tedious negotiations,&#x201D; but that he isn&#x2019;t yet willing to make concessions or sign a peace deal. &#x201C;He needs this war for its own sake, more than he needs victory in it, more than he needs Ukraine, and more than he needs anything else,&#x201D; Parkhomenko told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;For him, war is a way of life, a method of governing the country, a way of maintaining himself in power.&#x201D; In his evening address after Putin made his comments, Zelensky echoed the same sentiment. &quot;Putin is afraid to say directly to President Trump that he wants to continue this war, that he wants to kill Ukrainians. That&apos;s why they in Moscow demand such preconditions for a ceasefire that will make it impossible or will (postpone it) as long as possible,&quot; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/with-putin-demanding-new-concessions-for-a-ceasefire-all-eyes-are-on-trumps-next-move/	2025-03-14T03:03:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1152488863.jpg
Finland sentences Russian neo-Nazi mercenary Yan Petrovsky to life for war crimes in Ukraine	The Helsinki District Court sentenced Russian neo-Nazi mercenary Yan Petrovsky to life in prison for war crimes committed in Ukraine, Finnish public broadcaster Yle reported on March 14. Petrovsky, co-leader of the Rusich paramilitary unit, was convicted of war crimes in Luhansk Oblast on Sept. 5, 2014, during Russia&apos;s invasion of Donbas. Prosecutors presented video evidence showing him ordering and participating in the execution of Ukrainian soldiers. Petrovsky denied all accusations, but the court ruled that the video recordings provided sufficient proof of his involvement. Rusich, a notorious Russian neo-Nazi group, has documented and published evidence of its own war crimes, including torture and extrajudicial killings. One of the five charges against him was dismissed. Ukraine had requested Petrovsky&apos;s extradition, but a Finnish court ruled on Dec. 8, 2023, that he could not be sent to Ukraine, citing concerns over prison conditions under the European Convention on Human Rights. The Rusich unit, linked to Russia&apos;s Wagner Group, has a long history of brutality. Co-founder Alexey Milchakov gained notoriety for publishing images of animal cruelty and openly celebrating war crimes. Petrovsky has been under EU and U.S. sanctions since 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/finland-sentences-russian-neo-nazi-mercenary-petrovsky-to-life-for-war-crimes/	2025-03-14T02:53:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2187712266.jpg
Ukrainian drones strike Russian gas facilities, air defense missile depot, source claims	Drones launched by Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) struck two gas compressor stations and a warehouse storing missiles for Russia&apos;s S-300/S-400 air defense systems, a security source told the Kyiv Independent on March 14. The long-range drones targeted gas compressor stations in Russia&apos;s Tambov and Saratov oblasts, according to the source. Another strike reportedly hit a missile depot near the village of Radkovka in Belgorod Oblast, triggering a detonation of stored ammunition. &quot;The SBU conducted another successful special operation on enemy territory, causing significant damage to Russia&apos;s budget and reducing its ability to finance and sustain the war,&quot; the source said. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. 0:00/1&#xD7;The purported moment of a Ukraine Security Service (SBU) drone strike on industrial equipment at Russian gas compressor stations, published on March 13 (Exilenova / Telegram)The S-300 and S-400 systems are Russia&apos;s primary long-range air defense weapons, capable of intercepting aircraft, cruise missiles, and ballistic threats. Ukraine targets Russian gas compressor stations to disrupt energy exports, a key source of revenue for Moscow&#x2019;s war effort. Ukraine has consistently targeted Russia&apos;s fossil fuel and military infrastructure to weaken its ability to sustain prolonged aggression. Overnight on March 14, Ukrainian drones also hit the Tuapse oil refinery in Krasnodar Krai, setting fire to a gasoline storage tank. Russian pro-government media outlet Mash claimed the fire was caused by debris from a downed drone, while eyewitnesses reported hearing a series of explosions.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-target-russian-gas-facilities-air-defense-missile-depot-source-claims/	2025-03-14T01:48:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-14-at-10_47_13.png
Putin still seeks control over Ukraine despite US peace efforts, WP reports	Russian President Vladimir Putin has not abandoned his maximalist goal of controlling Ukraine, despite U.S. efforts to broker a ceasefire, the Washington Post (WP) reported on March 13, citing sources familiar with classified U.S. intelligence reports. Putin has a &quot;long-standing desire to restore &#x2018;Mother Russia&apos;&quot; and remains determined to assert power over Kyiv, one official said commenting on the U.S. intelligence assessment circulated among President Donald Trump&apos;s administration on March 6. Some officials reportedly believe that even if Russia agrees to a temporary truce, Moscow will use the pause to rearm, violate the agreement, and create provocations to blame on Ukraine. Ukraine had agreed to the truce during talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided Russia did as well. The deal led Washington to resume military and intelligence support for Kyiv. Putin said on March 13 that Russia is prepared to accept the U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire, but only if Kyiv halts mobilization, military training, and arms imports. Zelensky later dismissed Putin&apos;s conditions as &quot;Russian manipulations&quot; and called for tougher sanctions on Moscow. Trump, who has previously warned of &quot;devastating&quot; financial consequences for Russia if the war continues, said on March 13 that Putin&apos;s statement was &quot;very promising&quot; but &quot;wasn&apos;t complete.&quot; Moscow views Trump as weak, lacking a basic set of principles, and potentially open to manipulation, a European intelligence official told WP, citing fresh intelligence. If a permanent ceasefire is reached, Russia is likely to revert to the &quot;hybrid&quot; or non-military tactics it used to undermine Ukraine before its full-scale invasion in 2022, the official added. U.S. officials are reportedly cautious in assessing what peace terms Putin might agree to, but see no indication that he has backed down from his demand to bring Kyiv into Russia&apos;s sphere of influence. Western security officials told Bloomberg on March 10 that Putin has deliberately set &quot;maximalist&quot; demands on territorial concessions, peacekeepers, and Ukraine&apos;s neutrality, knowing they are likely unacceptable to Kyiv and European nations.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-still-seeks-control-over-ukraine-despite-us-peace-efforts-wp-reports/	2025-03-14T01:01:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1988745197.jpg
Ukrainian drones strike Tuapse oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar Krai, governor says	Ukrainian drones struck the Tuapse oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai overnight on March 14, setting fire to a gasoline storage tank, regional Governor Veniamin Kondratiev said. &quot;The area of the fire is more than 1,000 square meters, and emergency services are working,&quot; Kondratiev wrote on Telegram, claiming there were no casualties. Russian pro-government media outlet Mash reported that the fire was caused by debris from a downed drone. Eyewitnesses reportedly heard a series explosions over several minutes. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Kyiv has not commented on the attack. 0:00/1&#xD7;A purported video showing a fire burning at the Tuapse oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai following a reported attack by Kyiv on March 14, 2025. (Astra / Telegram)The Tuapse oil refinery, with an annual processing capacity of 12 million tons, plays a key role in supplying fuel to the Russian military. Following an earlier strike, the facility underwent an emergency shutdown in May. Kyiv has intensified attacks on Russian fossil fuel infrastructure, seeking to disrupt revenue streams that fund Moscow&apos;s war effort. Ukrainian forces regularly conduct long-range drone strikes on military and industrial targets inside Russia. Earlier this week, 74 drones were shot down on approach to Moscow in the early hours of March 11, authorities claimed, marking the largest drone attack against Russia&apos;s capital during the full-scale war. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its forces had intercepted a massive strike of 337 Ukrainian drones across multiple regions, including 91 over Moscow Oblast, 126 over Kursk Oblast, 38 over Bryansk Oblast, and others over the Belgorod, Ryazan, Kaluga, Lipetsk, Oryol, Voronezh, and Nizhny Novgorod regions. This is the largest number of drones launched against Russia in a single attack during the entire full-scale war. The strike took place as Ukrainian and U.S. delegations were about to meet in Saudi Arabia to discuss possible peace terms with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-hit-russias-tuapse-oil-refinery-reportedly-setting-fuel-tank-on-fire/	2025-03-13T23:53:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-14_07-21-50.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 891,660 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 891,660 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on March 14. This number includes 1,410 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,313 tanks, 21,443 armored fighting vehicles, 40,469 vehicles and fuel tanks, 24,455 artillery systems, 1,314 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,103 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 29,136 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-891-660-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-03-13T23:14:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2150597901.jpg
Majority of Americans believe Trump 'too closely aligned' with Russia, poll finds	Some 56% of Americans believe that U.S. President Donald Trump is &quot;too closely aligned&quot; with Russia amid shifting U.S. foreign policy, a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on March 13 found. A total of 40% of respondents disagreed with the statement, the poll showed, while 4% chose not to answer. Since taking office, Trump has distanced the U.S. from its traditional role as Ukraine&#x2019;s primary supporter, instead questioning Kyiv&#x2019;s commitment to peace and implying that Ukraine shares blame for the ongoing war. Those agreeing with the statement were split heavily along partisan lines, with 89% of Democrats and just 27% of Republicans agreeing that Trump &#xA0;is &quot;too closely aligned&quot; with Russia. Trump&#x2019;s recent stance on Ukraine, including his public rebuke of President Volodymyr Zelensky and short-lived halt on U.S. military aid to Kyiv, has drawn praise from Russian officials while raising concerns among European allies. His administration&#x2019;s position has prompted Russian officials to express optimism about a potential thaw in U.S.-Russia relations. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state television on March 3 that &quot;the new administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations,&quot; calling the shift a positive development that &quot;largely aligns&quot; with Moscow&apos;s interests. Since taking office Trump has called for Ukraine to sign a mineral resource deal with the United States. The deal was derailed after a spat between Zelensky, Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the White House on Feb. 28. Despite the complexities of the deal, a plurality of Americans, or 44%, said they support Trump&apos;s plan of &quot;conditioning U.S. military support for Ukraine on the U.S. getting a share of Ukraine&apos;s mineral wealth.&quot; The poll was conducted online among 1,422 U.S. adults between March 11-12 and has a margin of error of 3 percentage points.	https://kyivindependent.com/majority-of-americans-believe-trump-too-closely-aligned-with-russia-poll-finds/	2025-03-13T21:29:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1066818340.jpg
Large fire reported at oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar Krai following Ukrainian strike	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A large fire covering over 1,000 square meters engulfed the Tuapse oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai overnight on March 14, regional Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said on Telegram. Several explosions were heard by residents in the region around 5 a.m. local time. Videos posted on social media show a large fire burning in the location of the depot. Kondratyev later claimed on social media that the explosions were a results of an attack carried out by Kyiv. A gasoline storage tank is currently ablaze as over 100 emergency personnel are working to extinguish the blaze, Kondratyev added.

Enough is enough' — Greenland PM criticizes Trump's annexation efforts	Greenland&apos;s Prime Minister Mute Egede criticized U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s suggestion that the U.S. could annex Greenland in a Facebook post on March 13. &#x201C;The U.S. president has once again aired the thought of annexing us,&#x201D; Egede wrote. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t keep treating us with disrespect. Enough is enough.&#x201D; Egede announced plans to convene a meeting with Greenland&#x2019;s political leaders to reinforce their rejection of Trump&#x2019;s proposal. Trump&apos;s most recent comments about Greenland came during a White House meeting on March 12 with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. &#x201C;I think it will happen,&#x201D; Trump said in response to a reporter asking the probability of Greenland&#x2019;s annexation. He also claimed that the U.S. needs Greenland &#x201C;for international security.&#x201D; Greenland is an autonomous territory of Denmark and a NATO member state. The Arctic island houses both Danish and U.S. military bases and has vast reserves of mineral wealth. Russia has said it is monitoring developments regarding Trump and Greenland due to Moscow&apos;s own &quot;strategic interests&quot; in the Arctic region.	https://kyivindependent.com/enough-is-enough-greenland-pm-criticizes-trumps-annexation-efforts/	2025-03-13T20:04:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192273983.jpg
German Defense Minister calls for unified European approach toward defense procurement	German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius called for a unified European approach toward defense procurement in order to avoid bureaucratic delays, Reuters reported on March 12. &quot;We don&apos;t have time for this, it&apos;s excessive and expensive,&quot; he said. His remarks followed a meeting with defense ministers from the U.K., France, Italy, and Poland in Paris, where they discussed strengthening European defense and supporting Ukraine. Pistorius also called for coordinated and consistent arms purchases across Europe. &quot;We want to buy more, we want to buy consistently and simultaneously... together we can buy cheaper,&quot; he stated. Under German Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos;s leadership, Germany has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. Germany allocated around 8 billion euros in military aid to Ukraine in 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-defense-minister-calls-for-unified-european-approach-toward-defense-procurement/	2025-03-13T19:16:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193104154.jpg
Trump's Ukraine envoy sidelined by Kremlin amid peace talks, NBC reports	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, was excluded from peace talks between Russia and the United States after the Kremlin said it did not want him present, NBC News reported on March 13, citing U.S. and Russian officials. Although Kellogg was appointed by Trump to negotiate an end to Russia&apos;s war, he has been notably absent from the recent peace talks in Jeddah and Riyadh. According to a Russian official that spoke to NBC News, Russian dictator Vladimir Putin did not want Kellogg included in the peace talks because he is perceived as being too sympathetic to Ukraine. Kellogg previously co-authored a peace plan that would freeze the front line in Ukraine, take NATO accession off the table for an extended period, and partially lift sanctions imposed on Russia. His peace proposals also call for continued U.S. military aid to Ukraine as well as strong security guarantees to Kyiv to prevent further Russian aggression. Kellogg previously visited Kyiv in late February for discussions with Ukrainian officials, but has since not been involved in a U.S. delegation in talks with Russia. Notably, Trump&apos;s special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, has emerged as a key negotiator with Russia. Witkoff, who previously traveled to Russia to negotiate the release of American teacher Marc Fogel, arrived in Moscow on March 13 to discuss the 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine proposed by the U.S. According to experts who spoke with the Kyiv Independent last month, Kellogg may still have a role to play, particularly regarding U.S.-Europe relations. However, others suspect that Kellogg may have been fully sidelined and will no longer be involved in brokering peace between Ukraine and Russia. Kyiv agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia did as well. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on March 13 Russia is ready to agree to the U.S.-proposed ceasefire in Ukraine but demands guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops, nor receive military aid during it.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-ukraine-envoy-sidelined-by-kremlin-nbc-reports/	2025-03-13T17:58:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1242112038.jpg
US to resume shipping long-range bombs to Ukraine, Reuters reports	The United States is preparing to resume shipping long-range Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bombs (GLSDB) to Ukraine, Reuters reported on March 13, citing sources familiar with the weapon. According to Reuters, the GLSDBs, which have been upgraded to more effectively counter Russian jamming, may be used by Ukrainian military forces in the coming days, as a stockpile is already present in Europe. The weapons will arrive at a critical time, as U.S. and Ukrainian officials have confirmed that Kyiv&apos;s supply of Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles, has been depleted. In total, the U.S. sent Ukraine less than 40 long-range ATACMS since the start of the full-scale invasion. Earlier this week, President Trump&apos;s administration agreed to resume security assistance to Ukraine, including military aid and intelligence sharing, following high-level talks in Saudi Arabia. Kyiv also confirmed its commitment to the interim 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington, on the condition that Russia agrees to the terms and implements them simultaneously. U.S. security assistance to Ukraine had been previously frozen following the heated meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on February 28. The GLSDB can reportedly strike at a range of 160 kilometers, expanding Ukraine&#x2019;s long-range capabilities, alongside Storm Shadow/SCALP and ATACMS missiles. The delivery of the GLSDB was first announced by the Biden administration in February 2023, with initial estimates putting their arrival in Ukraine in late 2023. Ultimately, the weapons were first delivered in February 2024. As talks on a 30-day ceasefire continue, the Trump administration toughened sanction on March 13 on Russia&apos;s oil and gas industry. The move comes as U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 7 that he is considering imposing sweeping banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until there is a ceasefire and peace agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-receive-long-range-bombs-from-us-reuters-reports/	2025-03-13T16:06:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/SAAB.jpg
Sweden to provide $137 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine	Sweden will provide Ukraine with more than 1.4 billion Swedish kronor ($137.7 million) in humanitarian aid, the country&apos;s International Development Minister Benjamin Dousa announced on March 13. The support package, its largest civilian support package to date, will go toward humanitarian assistance as well as Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction and development. According to Dousa, the funds will address urgent needs such as energy supply, housing, medical care, mine clearance, safe schooling, vocational training, and veteran support. &quot;We must strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s resilience in every way possible. The Ukrainians are defending both their own freedom and security ours,&quot; Dousa said in a statement. The support package will be allocated to a number of projects and initiatives, including more than $10 million toward the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for mine clearance and energy infrastructure support. In 2025, Sweden&apos;s total support to Ukraine will account for 14 percent of its overall development assistance budget. In recent months, Sweden, a staunch NATO ally, has continued to provide Ukraine with various aid packages. On March 8 the Swedish Embassy in Ukraine announced the country will provide 22.5 million Swedish kronor ($2.2 million) to support Ukrainian women. And on Jan. 30, the country announced a military aid package to Ukraine worth over $1.2 billion &#x2014; Sweden&apos;s largest tranche of military assistance since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Earlier in the day on March 13, neighboring Finland announced that the country will provide its own military aid package valued at approximately 200 million euros ($217.4 million).	https://kyivindependent.com/sweden-to-provide-137-million-in-civilian-support-to-ukraine/	2025-03-13T15:37:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2156168873.jpg
US toughens sanctions on Russian energy payments	The Trump administration has toughened sanction on Russia&apos;s oil and gas industry on March 13 by not renewing an exemption that allows Russian banks to access U.S. payment systems to conduct energy transactions. The exemption, initially issued by the Biden administration, was not re-signed by Trump and will make it more difficult for countries to buy primarily Russian oil, likely leading to higher oil prices. The exemption initially applied to transactions involving natural gas, oil and petroleum products, coal, uranium, and similar products. The move comes as U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 7 that he is considering imposing sweeping banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until there is a ceasefire and peace agreement. Kyiv agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia did as well. The talks in Saudi Arabia also led to the U.S. restarting key military and intelligence support for Ukraine, which had been halted last week. Trump previously ruled out lifting sanctions on Moscow before a deal is reached. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on March 13 that Russia is ready to agree to the U.S.-proposed ceasefire in Ukraine but demands guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops, nor receive military aid during it. Reuters reported on March 12, citing Russian sources, that Russia is unlikely to agree to a temporary truce in Ukraine proposed by the U.S., feeling it has the upper hand on the battlefield and viewing the ceasefire as a trap. Shortly after his inauguration, Trump threatened to impose tariffs and sanctions on Russia to force their hand in negotiations, saying &quot;we can do it the easy way or the hard way.&quot; In the following weeks, Trump instead lashed out at Ukraine, claiming President Volodymyr Zelensky was &quot;not ready for peace&quot; and halting military aid to Ukraine and intelligence sharing with Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-toughens-sanctions-on-russian-energy-payments/	2025-03-13T15:13:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1240913057.jpg

McDonald's relaunches breakfast menu in Ukraine amid full-scale war	McDonald&apos;s Ukraine announced the return of its breakfast menu in six Ukrainian cities after the menu&#x2019;s disappearance following the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale Russian in February 2022, the company said in a press release on March 13. The comeback of McDonald&apos;s breakfast in Ukraine follows months of customer requests, with social media users repeatedly calling for its comeback and turning it into a viral trend. The announcement comes as more Western companies expand offerings to Ukrainian customers amid the full-scale war, with some companies choosing to reopen storefronts across the country. &quot;Around 60% of goods and products for McDonald&apos;s in Ukraine come from local suppliers. The company provides stable and large-scale orders, helping create new jobs and increasing tax revenues,&quot; said Oleksandr Bohorodov, CFO of McDonald&apos;s Ukraine. Breakfast is now available in six western Ukrainian cities &#x2013; Lviv, Lutsk, Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk, Yaremche, and Kovel &#x2013; until 10:30 AM in restaurants and 10:15 AM for delivery. Before relaunching its breakfast menu, McDonald&apos;s has been testing it in Vinnytsia since December. After Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, McDonald&apos;s temporarily suspended operations and reopened its first three restaurants in Kyiv in September 2022. McDonald&apos;s said breakfast will return to more cities in the coming weeks. However, in eastern regions closer to the front line, including Poltava, Dnipro, Kremenchuk, Kryvyi Rih, Kropyvnytskyi, and Oleksandriia, the breakfast menu will remain unavailable. The obstacles are primarily air raids and related operational difficulties, McDonald&apos;s wrote. For safety reasons, McDonald&apos;s restaurants close during air raid alerts, and all employees must take shelter. Once the alert ends, it takes about an hour to restart equipment and prepare for reopening, the company said. According to air raid statistics, on March 12, Sumy Oblast was under alert for 20 hours, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast for 17.5 hours, and Kharkiv Oblast for over 14 hours per day. Currently, 109 McDonald&apos;s restaurants are operating in 36 cities across Ukraine, the same number as before the invasion, employing around 10,000 people. Fifteen McDonald&apos;s locations in Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv, and Sumy remain closed, while restaurants in Dnipro, the main city of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, reopened in 2023. In January 2025, a Russian missile strike on Kyiv damaged Ukraine&#x2019;s oldest McDonald&apos;s, which first opened in 1997 as the country&apos;s first-ever location. Other retailers like H&amp;M reopened in November 2023, while Inditex, a Spanish-owned multinational company that owns Zara and other brands, reopened some of their stores in Kyiv in 2024. Swedish furniture giant Ikea also reopened their stores in Ukraine last summer. In 2022, following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, McDonald&apos;s closed its 847 restaurants in Russia, taking a financial hit of $55 million per month before fully exiting the Russian market.	https://kyivindependent.com/mcdonalds-relaunches-breakfast-menu-in-ukraine-amid-full-scale-war/	2025-03-13T13:37:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1243384031.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia needs war, Zelensky says in response to Putin's preconditions for ceasefire	Key developments on March 13: Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s remarks about a 30-day ceasefire indicate that he is preparing a rejection of the U.S. proposal, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during his evening address on March 13. &quot;Putin is afraid to say directly to (U.S.) President (Donald) Trump that he wants to continue this war, that he wants to kill Ukrainians. That&apos;s why they in Moscow demand such preconditions for a ceasefire that will make it impossible or will (postpone it) as long as possible,&quot; Zelensky said. Kyiv agreed to a temporary truce proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia did as well. Days after, on March 13, Putin said he was ready to agree to the proposal but demands guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops, nor receive military aid during it. Zelensky described Putin&apos;s response as &quot;Russian manipulations.&quot; &quot;Now we have all heard very predictable, very manipulative words from Putin in response to the idea of silence at the front &#x2014; he is in fact preparing to reject it as of now,&quot; Zelensky said. In his response during a press conference on March 13, Putin mentioned the situation on the battlefield, claiming that a ceasefire would be beneficial to Ukraine now as Russia is advancing along the front line. He also raised the question of who would control the temporary truce along the more than 2,000-kilometer front line. The American side is ready to organize the oversight and verification of the temporary ceasefire, according to Zelensky. He also argued that a truce would make it possible to address all security issues and &quot;put a plan to end the war on the table.&quot; &quot;We do not set conditions that complicate anything. Russia does that,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;They need a war.&quot; Zelensky called for pressure on Putin by imposing sanctions on Russia. Previously, Trump warned that Moscow could face &quot;devastating&quot; financial consequences if it chooses to continue its all-out war against Ukraine. Trump said on March 13 that Putin&apos;s statement regarding the 30-day ceasefire was &quot;very promising&quot; but &quot;wasn&#x2019;t complete,&quot; adding he is willing to meet with the Russian president. Russian forces have retaken Sudzha, a key stronghold of Ukrainian troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed on March 13. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claim. As of late March 12, the Ukrainian military confirmed battles in the Sudzha area. Ukrainian troops captured Sudzha, a town with a pre-war population of 6,000 some 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s border, at the start of the Kursk incursion in August 2024. Military analysts from the DeepState monitoring group and the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank have also reported that Russia has partially or fully seized Sudzha, as Ukraine is allegedly withdrawing from the town. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry published a video of the ruined Sudzha after its reported recapture. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the footage&apos;s veracity. &quot;The Russian military almost entirely destroyed Sudzha with airstrikes,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, an official at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. &quot;The town and its surroundings were destroyed, and few civilian buildings survived.&quot; The news comes at the heels of a rapid Russian advance in the border region that seemed to have greatly diminished the Ukrainian salient. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, said on March 12 that Russia has retaken more than 86% of the territory in Kursk Oblast captured by Kyiv in mid-2024. The Russian Defense Ministry also reported capturing the settlements of Melovoi and Podol as of March 13. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi acknowledged the &quot;difficult situation&quot; in the region but said that Ukraine will hold the defenses &quot;as long as reasonable and necessary.&quot; Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) drones attacked a camouflaged drone production facility in Russia&apos;s Kaluga Oblast late on March 12, HUR sources confirmed to the Kyiv Independent. Drone production lines were located on the grounds of an aerated concrete plant in the village of Obukhovo in Kaluga Oblast&apos;s Dzerzhinsky district, one of the sources claimed. The statement comes after Kaluga Oblast Governor Vladislav Shapsha said that 25 drones were downed over the region overnight, with drone wreckage setting fire to an unspecified industrial facility in Dzerzhinsky district. One employee suffered minor injuries, and the fire has been extinguished, according to Shapsha. Locals reported powerful explosions and a fire at the plant on social media. Drone debris also damaged a cell tower and a power line in the Khvastovichsky district, the southernmost part of Kaluga Oblast, Shapsha said. Russian air defenses downed 77 drones overnight, including 30 over Bryansk Oblast, six over Kursk and Voronezh oblasts each, and five over Rostov and Belgorod oblasts each, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed. An unspecified infrastructure facility was also damaged on the evening of March 12 in Voronezh Oblast, a region bordering Ukraine&apos;s Luhansk Oblast, Governor Alexander Gusev said on his Telegram channel. The targeted facility was part of the region&apos;s gas infrastructure, the Baza Telegram channel reported, citing residents. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Airports in Penza, Saratov, and Volgograd imposed temporary flight restrictions overnight, Russia&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency announced. Washington has discussed with Ukraine the control of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant as part of a potential peace deal, U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 13. Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump said that Ukraine and the U.S. had discussed a lot of details of the final deal, including &quot;concepts of land.&quot; &quot;We have been discussing with Ukraine land and pieces of land that would be kept and lost and all of the other elements of a final agreement,&quot; Trump said. &quot;There&apos;s a power plant involved, a very big power plant involved. Who is going to get the power plant, and who is going to get this and that, and so you know it&apos;s not an easy process. But phase one is the ceasefire,&quot; he added. The largest nuclear plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in the city of Enerhodar, has been under Russian occupation since 2022.

Putin is afraid to tell Trump he wants to continue war in Ukraine, Zelensky says	Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s remarks about a 30-day ceasefire indicate that he is preparing a rejection of the U.S. proposal, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during his evening address on March 13. &quot;Putin is afraid to say directly to (U.S.) President (Donald) Trump that he wants to continue this war, that he wants to kill Ukrainians. That&apos;s why they in Moscow demand such preconditions for a ceasefire that will make it impossible or will (postpone it) as long as possible,&quot; Zelensky said. Kyiv agreed to a temporary truce proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia did as well. Days after, on March 13, Putin said he was ready to agree to the proposal but demands guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops, nor receive military aid during it. Zelensky described Putin&apos;s response as &quot;Russian manipulations.&quot; &quot;Now we have all heard very predictable, very manipulative words from Putin in response to the idea of silence at the front &#x2014; he is in fact preparing to reject it as of now,&quot; Zelensky said. In his response during a press conference on March 13, Putin mentioned the situation on the battlefield, claiming that a ceasefire would be beneficial to Ukraine now as Russia is advancing along the front line. He also raised the question of who would control the temporary truce along the more than 2,000-kilometer front line. The American side is ready to organize the oversight and verification of the temporary ceasefire, according to Zelensky. He also argued that a truce would make it possible to address all security issues and &quot;put a plan to end the war on the table.&quot; &quot;We do not set conditions that complicate anything. Russia does that,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;They need a war.&quot; Zelensky called for pressure on Putin by imposing sanctions on Russia. Previously, Trump warned that Moscow could face &quot;devastating&quot; financial consequences if it chooses to continue its all-out war against Ukraine. Trump said on March 13 that Putin&apos;s statement regarding the 30-day ceasefire was &quot;very promising&quot; but &quot;wasn&#x2019;t complete,&quot; adding he is willing to meet with the Russian president.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-is-afraid-to-tell-trump-he-wants-to-continue-war-in-ukraine-zelensky-says/	2025-03-13T13:12:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164821112.jpg
Hungary seeks removal of Russian oligarch Fridman from EU sanctions list, FT reports	Hungary&#x2019;s ambassador to the EU demanded that Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman be removed from the sanctions list, threatening to block the extension of EU sanctions imposed on about 2,000 Russians otherwise, the Financial Times reported on March 13, citing four officials familiar with the matter. Hungarian leadership, broadly seen as the most Russian-friendly in the EU, has repeatedly obstructed and delayed the bloc&apos;s sanctions against Moscow and military aid for Ukraine. The travel restrictions and asset freezes on politicians and businessmen who supported Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine will expire on March 15, unless all EU member countries decide to extend them for another six months. The bloc&apos;s ambassadors are meeting in Brussels on March 13 after several days of talks that failed to reach a compromise, according to the Financial Times (FT). Initially, Budapest sought a removal of eight names from the sanctions list, including Russian oligarchs Petr Aven and Alisher Usmanov, but finally focused on Fridman, the newspaper wrote. Fridman and Aven were sanctioned by the EU on Feb. 28, 2022, for their ties to the Kremlin and support for Moscow&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine. In April 2024, the EU&#x2019;s General Court lifted sanctions against the two, ruling that the EU had failed to demonstrate their role in undermining Ukraine. However, subsequent EU decisions kept them on the sanctions list under a different justification, classifying them as &quot;leading businesspersons providing substantial revenue&quot; to Russia. Ukraine&apos;s staunchest allies, such as the Baltic States, reportedly opposed any easing of EU sanctions against Moscow. Hungary&apos;s idea to remove Fridman from the sanctions list was backed by Luxembourg, three unnamed officials told FT. Last year, Fridman filed a lawsuit against Luxembourg, where his stake in the London-based investment company LetterOne is located. The oligarch claimed $15.8 billion in sanctions-related damages.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-seeks-removal-of-russian-oligarch-fridman-from-eu-sanctions-list-ft-reports/	2025-03-13T12:39:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1168816031.jpg
US opposed to frozen conflict in Ukraine, Zelensky's chief of staff says	The U.S. opposes settling Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war against Ukraine as a frozen conflict, Presidential Office Head Andriy Yermak said on March 13. &quot;We have been very clear that we will never agree to a frozen conflict. We are very much against it, and our positions align with our American partners,&quot; Yermak said. Speaking on national television, Yermak said that the Ukraine-U.S. meeting in Saudi Arabia on March 11 &#x2013; which he had led &#x2013; and a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire are just the beginning, with more work ahead. Kyiv agreed to a temporary truce, provided that Russia did as well. Days after, on March 13, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he is ready to agree to the proposal but demands guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops, nor receive military aid during it. Washington opposed an agreement that would be similar to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum or the 2014-2015 Minsk agreements, which failed to prevent or stop Russia&apos;s aggression, Yermak said. According to Yermak, the Ukrainian and American delegations also agreed that European representatives would participate in the peace process. Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy, said earlier that Europe will not be directly involved in negotiations to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, but its interests will be considered.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-opposed-to-frozen-conflict-in-ukraine-zelenskys-chief-of-staff-says/	2025-03-13T12:20:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2201664857.jpg
‘Putin thinks Trump is an easy mark,’ John Bolton says in interview	Instead of approaching the war in Ukraine from a geopolitical and moral perspective, U.S. President Donald Trump is framing his policy on Russia through the lens of his personal relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to former U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton. &#x201C;Trump thinks Putin is his friend. He trusts Putin,&#x201D; Bolton told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Putin thinks Trump is an easy mark. And as a former KGB agent, Putin knows exactly how to manipulate him, and I think that&apos;s what he&apos;s been doing since the inauguration, if not before,&#x201D; he explained. Bolton served as the national security advisor to Trump from 2018-2019 during his first administration. Bolton&apos;s 2020 memoir, &#x201C;The Room Where It Happened,&#x201D; offers a candid account of the tumultuous turn his working relationship with Trump took, highlighting his concerns about his ability to effectively lead, including his impulsive decision-making on complex policy issues and lack of understanding of the importance of a strong U.S. foreign policy. In an interview with the Kyiv Independent, Bolton provided his insight on why Trump appears so eager to appease the Kremlin, why any U.S. attempt to align with Russia to deter China would be a &quot;fantasy,&quot; and the missed opportunities the U.S. for more than a decade to deter Russian aggression not only in Ukraine but beyond. This interview was conducted several hours before Putin signaled he was ready for a ceasefire on the condition that Ukraine doesn&#x2019;t receive more military aid or build its military. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.

(Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: Trump has repeatedly claimed that negotiating with Russia is easier than with Ukraine. Despite Russia&#x2019;s nightly attacks on Ukraine, he continues to insist that Putin wants peace. Why do you think Trump is so eager to cater to the Kremlin&apos;s interests, especially when they have such maximalist demands? John Bolton: Trump has said many times publicly that he believes if he has good relations with a foreign head of state, then the U.S. has good relations with that country. And the opposite is also true. If he has bad relations with a foreign head of state, U.S. relations with that country are bad. Trump thinks Putin is his friend. He trusts Putin. He has said in just the past few weeks, &#x201C;Putin says he wants peace, and I trust him. I think if he didn&apos;t want peace, he would tell me.&#x201D; &#xA0;So that gives you a pretty good idea of how he sees Putin. Now, I don&apos;t think Putin thinks he&apos;s Trump&apos;s friend at all. I think Putin thinks Trump is an easy mark. And as a former KGB agent, Putin knows exactly how to manipulate him, and I think that&apos;s what he&apos;s been doing since the inauguration, if not before. The notion that Russia is easy to deal with dates back to 2018, when Trump left Washington for the NATO summit &#x2014; where he nearly withdrew from the alliance &#x2014; before heading to Helsinki for a bilateral meeting with Putin. As he was leaving the White House to get on helicopter Marine One, he said to the assembled press, &#x201C;You know, I&apos;ve got this NATO meeting, then I&apos;m going to meet Prime Minister Theresa May in London, then I&apos;m going to meet Putin in Helsinki. You know, the meeting with Putin could be the easiest of them all. Who would think it?&#x201D; Well, there&apos;s only one person who would think it, and it&apos;s Trump. That was almost six years ago, and nothing has changed. The facts about Russia&#x2019;s conduct in the war &#x2014; being the aggressor from the start &#x2014; simply don&#x2019;t matter to Trump. After all, he believes in helping his friends. President Volodymyr Zelensky has had a strained relationship with Trump &#x2014; through no fault of his own or Ukraine&#x2019;s &#x2014; ever since the infamous &quot;perfect phone call&quot; in the summer of 2019, which ultimately led to Trump&#x2019;s first impeachment. And Zelensky has tried very hard, I think, in the past six months to build a relationship with Trump, but as we saw in the catastrophe in the Oval Office a few weeks ago, it hasn&apos;t worked. And there are people like U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance, who I think have also decided they don&apos;t like Zelensky and don&apos;t like Ukraine &#x2014; Vance once said in his 2022 Senate campaign, &#x201C;I don&apos;t care what happens to Ukraine.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s an uphill struggle. The Kyiv Independent: The Republican Party historically championed strong defense policies and deterrence against U.S. adversaries like Russia. What do you think accounts for the party&#x2019;s shift in attitude toward Ukraine? John Bolton: I believe a majority of Republicans actually still support Ukraine, certainly out in the country among Republican voters. And I think quietly behind the scenes, a majority in Congress do, too, but they&apos;re intimidated by Trump. They&apos;re very worried that he will support candidates against them in a primary election to decide who the Republican nominee will be. And in districts that are very safely Republican, it doesn&apos;t matter who the Democratic nominee is in November. It matters whether the incumbent House member, let&apos;s say, can win against a primary opponent. But I think the situation is beginning to change. More people are beginning to speak out. Trump&apos;s tariff policies are causing a lot of concern, and that adds to concern about his 180-degree shift toward Russia in the Ukraine situation. If our European allies continue their efforts to clarify who&#x2019;s at fault in Ukraine and what&#x2019;s at stake, we&#x2019;ll just have to keep fighting this battle day by day. The Kyiv Independent: The Kremlin has recently said that Trump&apos;s apparent foreign policy shift aligns with their interests. What damage does a U.S.-Russia alliance cause on the global stage? John Bolton: It could come close to destroying NATO. Having watched Trump come very close to withdrawing from NATO at the Brussels summit in 2018, I saw more than I needed to see about how much he doesn&apos;t like the institution &#x2014; he hasn&apos;t changed his view on that. But even before a formal withdrawal, he could do a lot that would debilitate NATO and really undermine the capabilities of the institution to defend its own members or its interests in other conflicts. It&#x2019;s a very dangerous course that he&apos;s pursuing. They&apos;re certainly watching it very carefully in Beijing, where they believe that if the U.S. and NATO won&apos;t stand up for a country in the middle of Europe that&apos;s been invaded, we won&apos;t stand up for Taiwan, we won&apos;t stand up for the Southeast Asian countries near the South China Sea. So it really does have global implications for U.S. security and that of our friends and allies, too. The Kyiv Independent: Some argue that Trump sees a potential rapprochement with Russia as a way to deter China in the future. I&apos;m curious about your thoughts on that, especially given the uncharacteristically supportive statements China has made for Ukraine recently. What is the dynamic that&apos;s forming here? John Bolton: It&apos;s a fantasy to believe the U.S. can somehow use the conflict in Ukraine to separate Russia from China. In the abstract, separating Russia is a very good goal to have. But for reasons not having anything to do with Ukraine or the U.S., Russia and China have grown closer, and it&apos;s really almost impossible to separate Russia from them today. The China-Russia axis is far from perfect, but in the case of the Ukraine war, China has been a considerable assistance to Russia. They have laundered sanctioned Russian financial assets through their own opaque financial system out into global markets. They&apos;ve significantly increased purchases of Russian oil and gas. They&apos;ve talked about building new pipeline capacity, which from China&apos;s point of view would be a plus so they don&apos;t have to lift oil in the Persian Gulf and risk taking it across the Indian Ocean. And they&apos;ve provided a lot of political cover for Russia during this war, which they would expect reciprocity for if they went against Taiwan or did something in the South China Sea. There are still differences of interest between Russia and China. This is not the Cold War Sino-Soviet alliance that had an ideological bond. And obviously China is the partner in charge now, not Russia. So it&apos;s not exactly the same, but I think the idea that somehow Russia could be pulled away from China as part of a settlement in Ukraine is totally unrealistic. I don&apos;t think China has any good intentions in mind for Ukraine, either &#x2014; they see it as something obviously Russia wants to have. The Kyiv Independent: Given your hawkish stance on Russia, was there a decisive moment in the past decade of the war in Ukraine when the U.S. had a real chance to deter Russian aggression but failed? John Bolton: When former U.S. President George W. Bush said at the Bucharest NATO Summit in April of 2008 that Ukraine and Georgia should have been brought into NATO on a fast track, that was the time to do it. Four months later, we saw the Russians move into Georgia, occupying Abkhazia and South Ossetia &#x2014; and they&#x2019;re still there. The only effective deterrence (against Russian aggression) is NATO membership, which is something that obviously Finland and Sweden concluded after 75 years of neutrality. They watched what happened in Ukraine and concluded the only real security was behind a NATO border. We had a chance in 2008 to do that (for Ukraine), and France and Germany objected. After Russia&apos;s 2014 annexation of Crimea and takeover of part of the Donbas, the West did little to impose meaningful sanctions. Former U.S. President Barack Obama showed no interest in taking strong action. I believe this all but guaranteed that when the Kremlin felt ready for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, they expected little resistance. That expectation was reinforced by the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan &#x2014; negotiated by Trump but carried out by Biden &#x2014; which sealed the deal. There were several missed opportunities (to combat Russian aggression), and unfortunately, we&#x2019;re seeing the consequences today. The Kyiv Independent: &#xA0;The Trump administration has said the ball is in Russia&#x2019;s court regarding a Ukraine ceasefire. But given Russia&#x2019;s track record of violating agreements and shifting blame, can we argue that responsibility now lies with the U.S.? If Russia inevitably breaks another ceasefire, and tries to blame Ukraine, how do you think Trump&#x2019;s administration will respond? John Bolton: We&#x2019;ll have to see what happens with the ceasefire first. The ceasefire is not in Ukraine&apos;s interest &#x2014; anything that freezes the conflict along the existing battle lines is laying a foundation for annexation of all the territory on the Russian side by the Russians. That&apos;s been their pattern before. I think Putin has not had any incentive to come to the negotiating table because Trump&apos;s been giving him everything that he wanted. But I think now, with this ceasefire idea out there, Putin also has to be careful he doesn&apos;t lose credibility with Trump. I don&apos;t think he will outright reject the ceasefire. He may accept it, or I think most likely he&apos;ll say something like, &#x201C;I think a ceasefire idea is absolutely worthwhile and I&apos;m ready to proceed. In principle, I agree with it.&#x201D; But there would be technical details to work out there, which wouldn&#x2019;t get worked out anytime soon. Putin, judging by Russian propaganda from yesterday, seems convinced that they are on the verge of pushing the remaining Ukrainian troops out of Kursk. I don&#x2019;t think he will entertain negotiations until that operation is complete. In the meantime, he&#x2019;ll stall for time, mindful of preserving the goodwill he has built with Trump. Although Trump has given away so much at this point, it&apos;s hard to see what he could take back. Hi there, it&#x2019;s Kate Tsurkan, thank you for reading my latest interview. Given Bolton&#x2019;s experience of working alongside Trump, I felt like he was one of the best people to talk to about the ongoing problems surrounding the U.S.&#x2019;s increasingly uncertain role in achieving peace in Ukraine.

China is more likely than the EU to replace Starlink on the Ukrainian battlefield	Fears of a Starlink shut-off at the front line have racked Ukraine. European satellite internet firms took the opportunity to step forward as replacements &#x2014; but even collectively, they are unlikely to fill the void in coverage that Starlink&apos;s shut off would leave. Today, Starlink satellite internet service dominates both worldwide and at Ukraine&#x2019;s front lines. Moreover, Chinese rather than European competitors are building equivalent satellite constellations. If Ukraine is left waiting on an ally to provide an alternative to Starlink, Russia will likely get one from China first. The U.S. paused weapons aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine last week, though that aid resumed after ceasefire talks in Jeddah. Ukrainians had feared Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and semi-official but eminently visible member of President Donald Trump&#x2019;s team would cut Starlink access in Ukraine. Musk has tweeted, however, that he would &#x201C;never do such a thing or use it as a bargaining chip.&#x201D; &#x201C;Nobody knows right now if he&#x2019;ll cut it off,&#x201D; Colonel Pavlo Khazan of the General Directorate of Electronic and Cyber Warfare within the General Staff tells the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;But this would be a very serious problem.&#x201D; There are a handful of alternative satellite internet providers, but on the ground, Starlink still provides several hundred times more bandwidth than the nearest second &#x2014; while also being much cheaper and easier to use. Starlink has proved remarkably resistant to Russian electronic interference. &#x201C;There would probably be some kind of catastrophe,&#x201D; a head of intelligence for a unit near Pokrovsk told the Kyiv Independent, who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons, &#x201C;because right now, everyone is still on Starlinks.&#x201D; &#x201C;There are no real alternatives,&#x201D; a cybersecurity specialist with Ukraine&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry who asked to remain anonymous as they were not authorized to speak publicly told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;But I hardly think they&#x2019;re going to turn it off. It would be bad for business.&#x201D; The character of Ukraine&#x2019;s defense would fundamentally change without Starlink. The front would not necessarily collapse, but it would certainly go much darker. European satellite internet firms are looking to fill in for Starlink at the same time that the European Union is broadly looking to take up the mantle of protection that Trump is keenly throwing away. But while they are eagerly presenting themselves as alternatives, they ultimately fall down on numbers. Among major proposed alternatives are providers like Luxembourg&#x2019;s SES and the French Eutelsat Group, which includes the British firm OneWeb. Of all 10,000-plus man-made satellites in orbit around the earth, over two-thirds are Starlink&#x2019;s. They are, moreover, the best of their kind. &#x201C;No one had really built industrial-level laser comms terminals before at this massive scale, and so Starlink just did it,&#x201D; says Blaine Curcio, a space and satcom consultant who publishes the China Space Monitor. Starlink has been shut off on the Russian side of the line since the start of the war. That made Kursk the largest test bed for a Starlink-free Ukrainian military. Reports have found OneWeb provided Ukrainian soldiers with satellite internet in Kursk Oblast during their seven-month occupation of the Russian region. Starlink&#x2019;s nearest functional competitor, OneWeb has 648 satellites in orbit. OneWeb has not launched a new satellite since &#x201C;completing its fleet&#x201D; in March 2023. The fleet only has one satellite over Ukraine. OneWeb&#x2019;s satellites each provide a bandwidth of 7.2 gigabits per second, adding up to a network with a &#x201C;cumulative usable capacity of 1.1 terabits per second.&#x201D; Starlink&#x2019;s current V2 satellites offer 96 Gbps, and SpaceX claims that its V3 satellite under development will hit 1 Tbps per unit. As of the end of 2024, Starlink&#x2019;s total capacity was roughly 350 Tbps. A Terabit is 125,000 megabytes. Streaming a high-definition movie requires around 10 megabytes per second, meaning only 12,500 people worldwide could watch a movie at the same time on OneWeb. Curcio sees EutelStat&#x2019;s claims of stepping up in Ukraine as a way of patching up a long-tarnished reputation. &#x201C;They have been beaten down pretty badly because everyone thinks it&#x2019;s a complete cash sink,&#x201D; said Curcio. &#x201C;In addition to saying, &#x2018;Hey, we care about the Ukrainians,&#x2019; they&#x2019;re trying to show people that OneWeb is something that can actually work, because that&#x2019;s been a big challenge for them.&#x201D; OneWeb has been around for almost as long as Starlink but has not had an illustrious track record. EutelSat Group, formed following a merger with OneWeb near the end of 2023, has seen its share price collapse in the intervening years. It went up over 600% following comments by Eva Berneke that they are &#x201C;looking at&#x201D; replacing Starlink in Ukraine. A medic from Ukraine&apos;s 43rd Brigade stands next to a Starlink terminal at a base in Bakhmut District on April 19, 2023, in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. (Ed Ram/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)Starlink currently boasts 5 million users globally and over 42,000 terminals in Ukraine. Representatives for OneWeb declined to comment on their ability to replicate that scale but wrote in a statement to the Kyiv Independent that &#x201C;OneWeb solutions can provide an alternative for certain government and defense applications.&#x201D; OneWeb representatives would also not answer as to where to buy its terminals in Ukraine. On outside markets, they run upwards of $10,000. New Starlinks, for comparison, sell on Ukrainian online electronics stores for just over $400, compared to roughly $549 on U.S. Amazon. The numbers for other would-be EU competitors to Starlink are even grimmer. SES has a total of 70 satellites. Canadian firm Telesat is currently trying to get 198 satellites into orbit. They face remarkably slow launch times. These EU telecoms are unlikely to be able to expand coverage rapidly to cover Ukraine in the near term. &#x201C;It&apos;s not feasible because there&apos;s not enough spare satellites,&#x201D; says Curcio. &#x201C;There are other constellations in development that will be bigger in terms of mass, but OneWeb is the one that has actually achieved its fleet,&#x201D; says Juliana Suess, an associate at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, &#x201C;whereas Project Kuiper, IRIS&#xB2;, etc., they haven&apos;t got satellites up yet. So they&apos;re not really an alternative for now.&#x201D; The California-based Astranis is one firm that Curcio points to as more likely to be able to send a handful of satellites to Ukraine in the near future, largely because they do launches for relatively high-risk customers like the Peruvian satellite communications company Andesat, some of whom go broke and can no longer pay for Astranis&#x2019; service. Another military comms service called TooWay is a joint project between EutelSat and Viasat dating back to 2007 that Ukraine was already using before Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. &#x201C;With TooWay, the speed of transfer of this data and internet connection is very small. That is, you&#x2019;ll end up downloading one video for half a day,&#x201D; Volodymyr &#x201C;Tekhnar,&#x201D; a battalion commander for the 28th Mechanized Brigade who declined to provide his last name for security reasons, told the Kyiv Independent.

(Pierre Crom/Getty Images)Russia hacked and brought down Tooway an hour before attacking on Feb. 24, 2022, ultimately pushing Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces onto Starlink in the first place. Despite being a consumer technology, Starlink has also remained remarkably resistant to Russian electronic warfare. As a result, Ukraine today remains &#x201C;quite&#x201D; dependent on Starlink, said Suess. In the absence of Starlink, alternatives would, in effect, take Ukraine&#x2019;s front-line forces back in time from broadband to dial-up internet. It&#x2019;s not likely to destroy the Ukrainian line overnight. But Ukrainian soldiers would shortly face communications issues similar to those of their Russian counterparts, shrouding them in a thicker fog of war. &#x201C;We are prepared for the event that the Starlink network goes down. We may not have super speeds, but let&apos;s just say that we will be able to watch online as time goes on,&#x201D; said Tekhnar. Starlink has been geofenced to skirt the Russian line since before the outset of the full-scale war. Russian acquisition of limited access hastened advances like that on Vuhledar this past fall. Conversely, the Ukrainian advance near the end of 2022 slowed as Ukrainian forces pushed forward faster than Starlink was restoring coverage to areas previously blocked as being under Russian occupation. Much of the souring of the relationship between Ukraine and Musk began with Musk refusing a Ukrainian request to turn on Starlink to allow a military operation in Crimea. Ukraine on its own has a handful of satellites in orbit, mostly of a tiny experimental variety. As of the end of 2024, Russian state-owned space firm RosKosmos tallied 288 satellites in orbit. Suess noted that most Russian satellites &#x201C;don&#x2019;t look like they&apos;re suitable for tactical communications.&#x201D; &#x201C;Some of the communication satellites that Russia has that were used by the intelligence service, for example, were purely mailbox satellites,&#x201D; she explained. &#x201C;So you send up a signal or a message, and then you have to wait for that satellite to just come back around to the ground station in however many hours.&#x201D; Like Russia, Ukraine without Starlink will have to depend more on data streams that are narrower and more vulnerable to interference, including frequency bands of cell service reserved for military and greater reliance on on-the-ground radio comms like walkie talkies, as well as civilian cell towers that often behave erratically at the front. Streaming and sharing high-resolution footage of drone attacks would become a largely untenable luxury. Further into the future, however, the most likely alternative to Starlink for both Russia and Ukraine is not European but Chinese. The first alternative to Starlink that came to mind for Colonel Khazan was G60 Starlink, also known as the Thousand Sails, a network of satellites from the Chinese company SpaceSail. &#x201C;The most relevant company by far is SpaceSail,&#x201D; agreed Curcio. &#x201C;In the last year and a bit, they&apos;ve now launched 72 satellites, and I guess more importantly, they&apos;ve entered a handful of forward markets in different ways.&#x201D; After years of Chinese state projects falling short of launch goals, the government gave &#x201C;the green flag for somewhat private investment&#x201D; into the telecom industry at the end of 2023, Curcio said. SpaceSail was the primary beneficiary. The firm is, however, barred from providing services within China and has a strictly international aim. &#x201C;Give them 18 months and SpaceSail will probably be able to get a couple tens of gigabits per second, maybe, of capacity over that general part of the world at any given time &#x2014; maybe more. Maybe a hundred,&#x201D; said Curcio of Ukraine. This is, however, not likely to benefit Ukraine in the long term. Ukrainian government agencies have in recent years purged Chinese telecoms equipment like Huawei from their networks since the start of the war. Chinese companies routinely provide Russia with high-tech services and equipment that the U.S. and EU ban. In January, SpaceSail set up a subsidiary in Kazakhstan, a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States and a long-time eager intermediary for Russian sanctions evasion. SpaceSail&#x2019;s ongoing launches are consequently more likely to give Russian soldiers in Ukraine internet services that Ukrainian soldiers have long enjoyed than they are to help Ukraine move beyond Starlink.

Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant part of peace talks, Trump says	Washington has discussed with Ukraine the control of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant as part of a potential peace deal, U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 13. Trump&apos;s remarks come days after Kyiv agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia did as well. The talks also concerned potential territorial concessions, according to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump said that Ukraine and the U.S. had discussed a lot of details of the final deal, including &quot;concepts of land.&quot; &quot;We have been discussing with Ukraine land and pieces of land that would be kept and lost and all of the other elements of a final agreement,&quot; Trump said. &quot;There&apos;s a power plant involved, a very big power plant involved. Who is going to get the power plant, and who is going to get this and that, and so you know it&apos;s not an easy process. But phase one is the ceasefire,&quot; he added. The largest nuclear plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in the city of Enerhodar, has been under Russian occupation since 2022. While the facility remains under Russian control, it is not currently generating electricity. Ukraine and its allies have repeatedly urged Russia to withdraw its troops from the plant. Throughout its occupation, the plant has been repeatedly disconnected from the Ukrainian power grid due to Russian attacks on the country&apos;s energy infrastructure. Russian forces currently occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine, from where reports of systematic repression, torture, and forced deportations emerge.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-occupied-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-part-of-peace-talks-trump-says/	2025-03-13T10:51:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1255012375.jpg
John Bolton on Trump’s Russian policy missteps	The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Kate Tsurkan sat down with former U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton to discuss why U.S. President Donald Trump considers Putin &#x201C;a friend,&#x201D; and why a ceasefire at this time would not be favorable for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/john-bolton-on-trumps-russian-policy-missteps/	2025-03-13T10:26:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_1337.JPG
BREAKING: Putin ready for ceasefire but demands 'guarantees' depriving Ukraine of aid	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. Russia is ready to agree to the U.S.-proposed ceasefire in Ukraine but demands guarantees that Kyiv will not mobilize or train troops, nor receive military aid during it, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on March 13. Speaking at a press conference with Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, Putin said that the end of hostilities should &quot;address the original causes of the crisis,&quot; parroting the Kremlin&apos;s long-standing narrative about its all-out war against Ukraine. Kyiv agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia did as well. The talks in Saudi Arabia also led to the U.S. restarting key military and intelligence support for Ukraine, which had been halted last week. According to Putin, the proposed temporary truce must be designed in a way to lead to a long-term peace. He said that Russia wants guarantees that Ukraine will not mobilize or train soldiers, as well as won&apos;t receive weapons during the 30-day ceasefire.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-ready-for-ceasefire-but-demands-guarantees-depriving-ukraine-of-aid/	2025-03-13T09:15:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/03/GettyImages-1249872830.jpg
Russia seeks to prolong war, Zelensky says about lack of clear response to proposed ceasefire	Russia is trying to delay peace for as long as possible, given the lack of its clear position on a proposed 30-day ceasefire, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 13. Kyiv agreed to a temporary ceasefire proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia did as well. The talks in Saudi Arabia also led to the U.S. restarting key military and intelligence support for Ukraine. Yuri Ushakov, a Russian presidential aide, said earlier on March 13 that the Kremlin was prioritizing a long-term settlement over a temporary ceasefire in Ukraine but the final position is up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to Zelensky, Kyiv is committed to moving quickly toward peace and is prepared to do its part in creating &quot;all of the conditions for a reliable, durable, and decent peace.&quot; &quot;Regrettably, for more than a day already, the world has yet to hear a meaningful response from Russia to the proposals made,&quot; he said. &quot;This once again demonstrates that Russia seeks to prolong the war and postpone peace for as long as possible.&quot; The U.S. is ready to organize the technical aspects of control over the temporary truce, Zelensky said. He voiced hope that Washington&apos;s pressure would be &quot;sufficient&quot; to compel Russia to end its all-out war. Zelensky&apos;s remarks come as U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, arrived in Moscow for talks on the proposed 30-day ceasefire. Witkoff is expected to meet Putin later in the day, who is unlikely to agree to a temporary truce in Ukraine, according to Reuters. The news agency reported on March 12, citing undisclosed Russian sources, that Moscow feels it has the upper hand on the battlefield and viewing the ceasefire as a trap. The ceasefire proposal coincided with Russia&apos;s breakthrough in Kursk Oblast. Moscow claimed on March 12 to have retaken over 86% of seized territories in the region, including a key town of Sudzha, captured by Ukrainian troops at the start of the Kursk incursion in August 2024. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi acknowledged the &quot;difficult situation&quot; in the region but said that Ukraine will hold the defenses &quot;as long as reasonable and necessary.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-seeks-to-prolong-war-zelensky-says-about-lack-of-clear-response-to-proposed-ceasefire/	2025-03-13T08:07:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204066732.jpg
The Counteroffensive: What Trump's intelligence sharing pause cost Ukraine	For nearly a week, Ukraine was left in the dark by its once-close ally, deprived of American intelligence as Russia advanced. Civilians suffered missile and drone attacks, while the military faced Russian offensives. All of this was aimed at forcing Ukraine into a &quot;peace&quot; agreement. &quot;(With U.S. President Donald Trump), there is a swing that goes back and forth. To be honest, I don&apos;t know what will happen next,&quot;said Maksym*, a Ukrainian soldier working with intelligence. After a weeklong pause, U.S. intelligence sharing resumed during talks between the U.S. and Ukraine in Saudi Arabia on March 11. During the hiatus, Ukraine&#x2019;s position weakened as Russian forces captured more territory and launched terror attacks on civilians. On March 8, for example, Russia launched a massive missile and drone attack on Odesa, hitting the port and civilian targets. This pause demonstrated that the U.S. was willing to cut its partner off from vital intelligence, even as Ukraine faced escalating threats. &#x201C;This is not Mean Girls. This is not some episode of some television show. This is very serious,&#x201D; said U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, announcing the resumption of intelligence sharing. Someone should remind him that it was his administration&#x2019;s actions that put people&#x2019;s lives in danger due to a political dispute. Trust is hard to build and easy to lose. Ukraine will never fully trust the Trump administration again, and every day will bring new worries about whether another slip of the tongue could lead to another suspension of support. This isn&#x2019;t &quot;deal-making&quot; as the Trump White House might frame it. It&#x2019;s hostage-taking, the worst kind: preventing long-time allies from defending themselves against a deadly foe. &quot;Of course, we were upset. That goes without saying. The lack of intelligence sharing brings a lot of problems,&quot; Maksym told The Counteroffensive. Before the war, Maksym worked in IT, with no military background. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion, he woke to a strange sound: &quot;Who sets off fireworks at five in the morning?&quot; It didn&#x2019;t take long to realize that those weren&#x2019;t fireworks. Worried that Russian forces might invade his home region of Rivne, bordering Belarus, Maksym left Kyiv to join Ukraine&apos;s territorial defense. Over the past three years, he&#x2019;s taken on multiple roles: training troops on drone operations, becoming an air defense specialist, and eventually working in intelligence. He now focuses on open-source intelligence and automating processes within Ukraine&#x2019;s military. While the exact sources of Ukraine&apos;s intelligence are unclear, Politico estimates that 80% of it comes from foreign sources, with the majority provided by the U.S. Specifically, the U.S. supplies Ukraine with radar data, satellite imagery, and alerts about Russian aircraft or missile launches. Thankfully, no one interviewed by The Counteroffensive considered the suspension of U.S. intelligence to be an irreversible catastrophe. Although this pause significantly hampered Ukrainian operations, Kyiv could still gather intelligence from its own drones, radio interceptions, and by working with other countries. However, U.S. intelligence had never been fully comprehensive. Washington shared only a portion of its data with Ukraine and sometimes did so with delays.

(Diego Fedele/Getty Images)The U.S. advantage is its unrivaled dominance in military satellite reconnaissance. With nearly 250 military satellites, the U.S. conducts near real-time surveillance. NATO countries combined have just about 50. For Ukraine, the suspension of satellite imagery from U.S.-based Maxar was particularly critical. Though Ukraine could purchase satellite imagery on its own, the cost was high. Maxar provides 90% of U.S. geospatial intelligence and can capture key locations every 3-4 hours with high resolution &#x2014; capabilities few others can match. &quot;We could see, for example, a Russian convoy moving toward a certain location, allowing us to prepare in advance. But now, our troops are somewhat &apos;blind,&apos;&quot; Maksym said before U.S. intelligence sharing resumed. Ukraine still had two satellites of its own and one provided by Germany, but Maxar&#x2019;s contributions were far more comprehensive. During the pause, France offered some assistance, though its capabilities were far more limited. French satellites specialize in electromagnetic spectrum monitoring, which can detect Russian activity. Additionally, suspending intelligence sharing complicated the use of U.S. weapons like the HIMARS precision-guided missile system, which relies heavily on American intelligence. Ukrainian forces have used HIMARS to disrupt Russian supply routes and destroy ammunition depots. However, without U.S. data, Ukrainian troops had to rely on their own drones for targeting. According to Oleksii Teplukhin, CEO of the Ukrainian AI startup Griselda, intelligence pauses like this severely hinder Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to plan deep strikes inside Russia. &quot;To take out an (Russian) oil depot, you don&#x2019;t just need to know where it&#x2019;s located. You need more detailed intelligence &#x2014; what was there last week, the exact position of the rectification column [a technological apparatus used for separating mixtures], and so on,&quot; Oleksii told The Counteroffensive. But the suspension didn&#x2019;t just impact the military. Civilians paid the price too. &quot;I&#x2019;m glad U.S. support has been restored. At the very least, it will help our air defense because, over the past few days, both drones and missiles have heavily terrorized cities like Dnipro and Odesa,&quot; Maksym said. Despite the setbacks, Maksym doesn&#x2019;t consider Americans enemies. He&#x2019;s puzzled by the motivations behind the White House&#x2019;s decisions. Going forward, though, he believes Ukraine will take steps to reduce its reliance on the U.S. and look more toward European allies, such as NATO, for intelligence. Ukraine has learned a vital lesson: it can&#x2019;t rely solely on others for its survival. Just as Kyiv developed its own long-range weapons when Western allies hesitated, it&#x2019;s likely to seek independent solutions for intelligence. &quot;The U.S. is a huge country, and any mistakes or inaccuracies on its part affect the entire world. It&#x2019;s like a voodoo doll for the whole planet,&quot; Maksym said. The name of the military service member has been changed for security reasons.

Ukraine receives $1.7 billion from Canada under G7 loan covered by Russian assets	Ukraine has received the first tranche of 2.5 billion Canadian dollars (about $1.7 billion) from Ottawa under the G7&apos;s Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) initiative, the Ukrainian Finance Ministry announced on March 13. The ERA mechanism, totaling $50 billion, provides loans to Ukraine that will be repaid using future profits from frozen Russian assets. According to the ministry, Canada&apos;s contribution to the initiative is $3.5 billion, and the loan will be granted for 30 years. &quot;Canada is a reliable and steadfast partner of Ukraine. I am grateful for the support of the ERA mechanism. It is a fair and necessary tool to hold Russia financially accountable for its crimes in Ukraine,&quot; Ukrainian Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko said. Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, G7 countries have frozen approximately $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets. The ERA initiative, backed primarily by the U.S. and the EU, aims to use profits from these frozen assets to finance Ukraine&apos;s defense and reconstruction. In addition to the Canadian contribution, Kyiv received 752 million pounds ($970 million) as the first installment of the U.K.&apos;s contribution to the G7 loan, as Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on March 7.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-receives-1-7-billion-from-canada-under-g7-loan-covered-by-russian-assets/	2025-03-13T06:58:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2201099727.jpg
Putin has likely rejected Trump's ceasefire proposal — what now?	It looks like Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected the 30-day ceasefire proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump on the war against Ukraine. According to the Financial Times, citing an unnamed senior aide to Putin, Moscow does not want a temporary ceasefire and is pushing for a long-term peace settlement that will &quot;take into account its interests and concerns.&quot; Trump promised tough action against Russia if it failed to engage in peace talks over Ukraine. He suggested escalating military support for Ukraine and imposing severe sanctions on Russia in response. Keep in mind that when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky voiced similar skepticism about a temporary ceasefire and called for more substantive talks before pursuing long-term peace, he was harshly criticized. In that now-infamous Oval Office moment, Trump berated Zelensky for not being serious about peace, even threatening to cut military and intelligence support for Ukraine. This decision cost real lives. So what will Trump do now? Putin has just smashed the ball back into Trump&#x2019;s court, and now the president is scrambling to keep the game going. His next move will be crucial in signaling to all parties, particularly Putin, whether Trump is really willing to use a &quot;stick&quot; approach against Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) walks past a guard before a meeting with Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashshenko at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, on March 13, 2025. (Maxim Shemetov/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)Putin can smell weakness. He&#x2019;s seen it throughout the negotiation process with Trump, who already gave away much of his negotiating leverage before any talks even began &#x2014; promising Russia could keep all the territory it currently occupies, agreeing to no NATO membership for Ukraine, no security guarantees for Ukraine, and a quick lift on sanctions. Putin will likely exploit this weakness and Trump&#x2019;s apparent desire to win Putin&#x2019;s favor at Ukraine&#x2019;s expense. Putin&#x2019;s modus operandi in negotiations, both on Ukraine and with the West, has always been to use talks as a leverage point to secure concessions. He sees negotiations as a way to probe for weaknesses and demand concessions. His instinct here will be to play hard to get, drag talks out to show strength, or imply that Russia doesn&#x2019;t need a ceasefire &#x2014; the other side is the one that really wants it. The danger for Putin is that if he pushes too hard, drags things out too long, he risks angering Trump. The assumption here is that the U.S. would boost military support for Ukraine and increase sanctions on Russia. However, given that the Trump administration has thus far taken a carrot-and-stick approach &#x2014; offering carrots to Russia and sticks to Ukraine &#x2014; it&#x2019;s unclear whether Trump has the resolve to really take on Putin. If I have doubts, so does Putin, and he will likely test the U.S. position in these ceasefire talks. Understanding the Trump administration&#x2019;s willingness to play hardball now will be useful for Putin later when more substantive talks begin. Is Trump truly willing to play tough with Putin to secure peace in Ukraine?

Kyiv Mayor Klitschko announces more dismissals of city officials amid corruption probe	Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko announced further dismissals of top city officials on March 13 amid a widening corruption probe into land dealings in the capital. The dismissals follow revelations from Ukraine&apos;s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&apos;s Office (SAPO), which released recordings of Kyiv officials allegedly involved in fraudulent land schemes. &quot;Regarding the latest high-profile news concerning the capital&apos;s land sector, the city provides law enforcement officers with all requested documents and facilitates the investigation,&quot; Klitschko wrote on Facebook. The following officials are set to be dismissed: Ihor Dolinsky, director of the Kyiv Institute of Land Relations; Volodymyr Sharyi, director of the special housing fund; Viktor Pohrebnoi, director of the Financial Company Zhytloinvest; and Valentina Sviatina, deputy director of the Department of Urban Planning and Architecture, Klitschko said. Klitschko previously announced on Feb. 28 that Yurii Leonov, deputy director of the city&apos;s special housing fund, Oleksii Mushta, deputy head of an urban infrastructure management agency, and Petro Olenych, deputy head of the Kyiv City Administration, are also being fired. Kyiv city council member and chairman of the land commission Mykhailo Terentiev has written a letter of resignation from the Engineering Center communal enterprise director post. &quot;Also, the Udar political party faction recalls him from the Kyiv council deputies,&quot; Klitschko added. Investigators claim the suspects registered ownership of non-existent buildings to obtain land plots without a fair tender. Olenych was previously detained in February, with the High Anti-Corruption Court setting bail at Hr 15 million (nearly $360,000). He was released on Feb. 21 and claimed that his family had borrowed money for bail while he planned to seek suspension from office during the investigation. Authorities have charged 10 individuals in the case, seven of whom have been detained. The alleged mastermind, former Kyiv City Council member Denys Komarnytskyi, remains on Ukraine&apos;s wanted list.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-mayor-klitschko-fires-top-officials-amid-corruption-probe/	2025-03-13T06:44:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2198905810.jpg
Kyiv sees no surprises as Russia signals its rejection of US-backed ceasefire proposal	Russia is signaling its intention to reject a U.S. ceasefire proposal already accepted by Ukraine in Jeddah this week, setting the stage for a likely diplomatic standoff between Washington and Moscow. After nearly 48 hours of silence on the issue, Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov on March 13 dismissed the idea of a ceasefire, describing it as a &quot;respite for the Ukrainian military&quot; and adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin would comment on the matter later in the day. Following weeks of tumultuous talks and meetings, including the now infamous Oval Office showdown, Ukrainian and U.S. officials on March 11 emerged from talks in Saudi Arabia in agreement over a ceasefire proposal. Kyiv said it was ready to accept a 30-day-long ceasefire if Russia did as well. In the words of U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Kyiv&#x2019;s readiness meant the &quot;ball is in (Russia&apos;s) court,&quot; adding that if the Kremlin rejected the proposal, &quot;then we&apos;ll, unfortunately, know what the impediment is to peace here.&quot; In response to Ushakov&#x2019;s statement, a source in the President&apos;s Office told the Kyiv Independent that it is &#x201C;awaiting what Putin will say.&#x201D; The source added that it would be &quot;a question for the Americans&quot; if Putin rejects the U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal. The potential rejection came as no surprise in Kyiv. &quot;Putin is absolutely not interested in peace or a true ceasefire,&quot; lawmaker Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of the parliament&apos;s foreign affairs committee, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;On the other hand, he is afraid of (U.S. President Donald) Trump. So, he will try to formulate his response to Trump&apos;s proposal as a sort of agreement but with unacceptable demands.&quot; The expectation in Kyiv &#x2014; as well as in other Western capitals &#x2014; is that Putin will not back down from the maximalist demands he set out at the beginning of his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;Putin has not backed off one iota from his maximalist demands, which we all know, (includes) the four (oblasts) of eastern Ukraine, and the neutralization of Ukraine,&quot; General Sir Richard Shirreff, former deputy supreme allied NATO commander Europe, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;In other words, no NATO, the demilitarization of Ukraine, the &apos;denazification&apos; of Ukraine, by which he means installing a puppet government.&quot; Russia is set to demand Ukraine withdraw from areas of the four oblasts &#x2014; Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk &#x2014; it illegally annexed in 2022 despite not fully controlling them. The future of any peace process now hinges on Trump&apos;s response. The U.S. has a lot less leverage than it did just a few weeks ago. The Trump administration has ruled out NATO membership for Ukraine and said Kyiv must be prepared to concede territory. These moves were described by Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia and professor of international studies at Stanford University, as &quot;giving away all your strongest cards before the negotiation has started.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s an incredibly bad negotiating strategy on behalf of the Trump team,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent earlier this week. Ukraine has largely accepted that it won&apos;t be joining NATO in time to make a difference to the ongoing peace talks, but the issue of territorial concessions is still in play. Although Kyiv may be forced to agree to some sort of territorial concessions, it has previously rejected a full withdrawal from all four oblasts. Putin, however, said such a move would be a prerequisite for peace talks. These mutually incompatible viewpoints mean Trump will be forced to step in and mediate, though what exactly he will do &#x2014; and which side he&apos;ll come down on hardest &#x2014; remains to be seen. &quot;Trump&apos;s got to do something; otherwise, he&apos;ll look very weak,&quot; Shirreff said. Now, the U.S.&apos;s strongest hand remains economic pressure in the form of sanctions, something Trump has already threatened Russia with if they don&apos;t agree to the ceasefire proposal. John Herbst, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, told the Kyiv Independent that this puts immense pressure on Trump to follow through. &quot;If he suddenly makes a new demand on Ukraine because Russia is asking for it, he looks like Putin&apos;s poodle,&quot; he said. But there&apos;s always the possibility Trump could impose Putin&apos;s maximalist demands on Ukraine, something Shirref said would have enormous consequences for the entire world. &quot;If the international community signed up to that, it would mean the absolute final nail in the coffin of the international rules-based order,&quot; he said. &quot;Because it means that might is right, and that Putin has got what he wants by appalling force.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-sees-no-surprises-as-russia-signals-its-rejection-of-us-backed-ceasefire-proposal/	2025-03-13T06:37:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202985151.jpg
Putin aide claims NATO 'threatens' Russia in Baltic	Russian presidential aide Nikolai Patrushev claimed on March 13 that NATO is deliberately &quot;escalating&quot; tensions in the Baltic region, portraying the alliance as a threat to Russia&apos;s security. His comments come amid NATO&apos;s warnings that Russia may be ramping up hybrid operations in the region. Several undersea cables were damaged in recent months, leading the alliance to increase its presence in the Baltic Sea. Speaking to National Defense, a Russian military and political magazine, Patrushev alleged that NATO&apos;s naval forces are working to &quot;block&quot; Russia in the Baltic while ignoring diplomatic engagement with Moscow. Patrushev further accused the alliance, particularly the U.K., of provoking instability in the region. &quot;The forecast of the situation in the Baltic allows us to draw attention to the deliberate fomentation of regional tensions by the naval forces of European countries of the alliance,&quot; he said. Patrushev also claimed, without evidence, that NATO is conducting cyberattacks on Russian ships&apos; navigation systems to create maritime emergencies, including accidents and infrastructure failures. While Russian-linked vessels have been detained in connection to damaged Baltic Sea cables, Western intelligence agencies remain divided on whether they were acts of sabotage or accidental damage. Tensions between NATO and Russia have risen following Moscow&apos;s all-out attack against Ukraine. Western leaders and intelligence agencies have warned of a potential large-scale war in Europe within the next five years, citing Russia&apos;s increasingly aggressive posture.	https://kyivindependent.com/putins-aide-blames-nato-for-escalating-tensions-in-the-baltic/	2025-03-13T06:07:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1245767486.jpg
ECHR rules Ukraine failed to prevent, investigate violence in Odesa in 2014	The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled on March 13 that the Ukrainian government failed to prevent and adequately investigate deadly clashes between the EuroMaidan supporters and opponents in Odesa in May 2014. The ruling concerns seven applications filed by 28 individuals &#x2014; 25 relatives of the victims and three survivors &#x2014; between 2016 and 2018. Forty-eight people died in the violence that erupted between the two camps on May 2, 2014. A group of pro-Russian activists attacked a pro-EuroMaidan rally but retreated to the Trade Unions House after the ensuing violence. Forty-two of the EuroMaidan opponents died after the building caught fire as the two groups began throwing petrol bombs. Two pro-Ukrainian activists were also killed after suffering gunshot wounds. The ruling noted &quot;authorities&#x2019; failure to do everything that could reasonably be expected of them to prevent the violence in Odesa on 2 May 2014, to stop that violence after its outbreak, to ensure timely rescue measures for people trapped in the fire, and to institute and conduct an effective investigation into the events.&quot; The ECHR noted that Russian propaganda helped to instigate the clashes but acknowledged the applicants&apos; complaints that Ukraine failed to prevent the violence and adequately investigate it. The Ukrainian state was ordered to pay out compensations. The plaintiffs included relatives of victims from both camps, all of whom accused the Ukrainian state of inaction. Russian propaganda has heavily employed the violent episode in Odesa to vilify the EuroMaidan Revolution and falsely paint the movement as pro-Nazi and extremist. The EuroMaidan Revolution began in November 2013 when people gathered at Maidan Nezalezhnosti, Kyiv&apos;s central square, to protest pro-Kremlin President Viktor Yanukovych&apos;s refusal to sign the long-awaited Association Agreement with the European Union. Law enforcement officers, namely Berkut riot police, used violence to suppress the protests, including lethal force. More than 100 people were killed during the revolution, which culminated in Yanukovych fleeing to Russia. &quot;The Court noted that distortion of the events in Odesa had eventually become a tool of Russian propaganda in respect of the war waged by the Russian Federation against Ukraine since February 2022,&quot; the ECHR&apos;s ruling said. &quot;Enhanced transparency in the related investigative work by the Ukrainian authorities might have helped to prevent or counteract that propaganda effectively.&quot; The court noted that the investigation should have been &quot;carried out by an organ entirely independent from the police.&quot; At the same time, the ECHR dismissed allegations that the authorities were not impartial when investigating the deaths of EuroMaidan opponents and supporters.	https://kyivindependent.com/echr-rules-ukraine-failed-to-prevent-violence-in-odesa-in-2014/	2025-03-13T05:40:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-458286736.jpg
Top Putin aide opposes temporary ceasefire, calls it 'respite' for Ukraine	The Kremlin is prioritizing a long-term settlement over a temporary ceasefire in Ukraine, Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov said on March 13, calling the U.S. truce proposal a &quot;respite for the Ukrainian military.&quot; His remarks come as U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, reportedly arrived in Moscow for talks on a proposed 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to provide further comments on March 13. &quot;We believe that our goal is a long-term peaceful settlement, and we are striving for that, a peaceful settlement that takes into account the legitimate interests of our country and our known concerns,&quot; Ushakov said on state television. Ushakov added that he outlined Russia&apos;s position on the ceasefire to U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. &quot;I outlined our position that this (ceasefire) is nothing more than a temporary respite for the Ukrainian military, nothing more,&quot; Ushakov said. Waltz and Ushakov also agreed that Ukraine&apos;s potential NATO accession cannot be part of the peace settlement debate, Putin&apos;s aide claimed. The Trump administration has previously called Kyiv&apos;s prospects of joining the alliance unrealistic, while Russia has named a ban on Ukraine&apos;s entry as one of the key conditions in any negotiations. Asked about Witkoff&#x2019;s possible arrival in Moscow, Ushakov declined to comment, saying, &quot;We agreed that this kind of contact would be of a closed nature.&quot; Kyiv agreed to the U.S. proposal during negotiations in Jeddah on March 11, after which Washington resumed military and intelligence support for Ukraine. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham called for sanctions against Russia if Moscow refuses a proposed ceasefire. He promised to introduce new congressional measures targeting Russia and nations that continue to buy Russian goods, including oil, gas, and uranium. In the past, Moscow ruled out a temporary ceasefire that would freeze the conflict along the current front lines. Russian nationalist voices and pro-war bloggers have already spoken out against the U.S.-backed proposal. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed that U.S. officials are in Moscow but did not disclose Russia&apos;s position on the ceasefire proposal.	https://kyivindependent.com/ushakov-comments-on-ceasefire/	2025-03-13T04:34:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2160070185.jpg
Finland announces $217 million military aid package for Ukraine	Finland has announced its 28th military aid package for Ukraine, valued at approximately 200 million euros ($217.4 million), the Finnish Defense Ministry said on March 13. Finnish Defense Minister Antti Hakkanen confirmed that the package includes artillery ammunition, citing Ukraine&apos;s urgent need for such supplies. &quot;There is broad political support and national unanimity on the issue of assistance to Ukraine,&quot; Hakkanen said. The announcement comes as U.S. President Donald Trump urges Europe to take greater responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security while sending mixed signals on whether European allies should be involved in peace negotiations. During a meeting with Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, Hakkanen signed a memorandum of understanding on deepening defense cooperation. The agreement covers defense materiel, intelligence sharing, research and innovation, and munitions production. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Finland has provided Ukraine with 2.5 billion euros ($2.6 billion) in defense aid. On Feb. 26, Helsinki pledged an additional 660 million euros ($691 million) in military assistance, including domestically produced equipment.	https://kyivindependent.com/finland-announces-over-200-million-military-aid-package-for-ukraine/	2025-03-13T04:15:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2064209173--1-.jpg
Rheinmetall prepared to supply arms for possible Ukraine peacekeeping mission	German defense company Rheinmetall is prepared to supply weapons for a potential international peacekeeping mission in Ukraine following the end of Russia&#x2019;s war, the company&apos;s CEO, Armin Papperger, said on March 12, Deutsche Welle reported. Papperger said that Rheinmetall could provide &quot;more than 2,000 items&quot; for such a mission, including tanks, armored vehicles, electronic warfare systems, reconnaissance drones, and satellite technology for monitoring a demarcation line. Several European countries, including the U.K., France, Denmark, and Sweden, have previously expressed willingness to deploy peacekeepers to Ukraine. The Washington Post reported on Feb. 17 that up to 30,000 European troops could be involved in the ceasefire monitoring mission. Papperger noted that the talks remain theoretical for now, with no concrete negotiations underway with the company. While U.S. President Donald Trump claimed on Feb. 24 that Russian President Vladimir Putin would allow European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a peace deal, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has rejected the idea. Rheinmetall is one of Europe&#x2019;s largest arms manufacturers and a key supplier to Ukraine. Under German government contracts, it delivers 155 mm artillery rounds, Leopard 1 tanks, mortar shells, and surveillance drones. The company also opened a military vehicle repair facility in Ukraine in June 2024 and plans to build three additional plants in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/rheinmetall-prepared-to-supply-arms-for-possible-ukraine-peacekeeping-mission/	2025-03-13T03:52:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2076692591.jpg
Ukrainian drones strike covert UAV plant in western Russia, sources claim	Ukrainian military intelligence drones (HUR) attacked a camouflaged drone production facility in Kaluga Oblast late on March 12, HUR sources confirmed for the Kyiv Independent. Drone production lines were located on the grounds of an aerated concrete plant in the village of Obukhovo in Kaluga Oblast&apos;s Dzerzhinsky district, one of the sources claimed. Kyiv has carried out regular long-range drone strikes against military and industrial facilities in Russia&apos;s rear, seeking to undermine its ability to wage its all-out war. The statement comes after Kaluga Oblast Governor Vladislav Shapsha said that 25 drones were downed over the region overnight, with drone wreckage setting fire to an unspecified industrial facility in Dzerzhinsky district. One employee suffered minor injuries, and the fire has been extinguished, according to Shapsha. Locals reported powerful explosions and a fire at the plant on social media. Drone debris also damaged a cell tower and a power line in the Khvastovichsky district, the southernmost part of Kaluga Oblast, Shapsha said. Russian air defenses downed 77 drones overnight, including 30 over Bryansk Oblast, six over Kursk and Voronezh oblasts each, and five over Rostov and Belgorod oblasts each, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed. An unspecified infrastructure facility was also damaged on the evening of March 12 in Voronezh Oblast, a region bordering Ukraine&apos;s Luhansk Oblast, Governor Alexander Gusev said on his Telegram channel. The targeted facility was part of the region&apos;s gas infrastructure, the Baza Telegram channel reported, citing residents. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Airports in Penza, Saratov, and Volgograd imposed temporary flight restrictions overnight, Russia&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency announced.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-strike-covert-uav-plant-in-western-russia-source-confirms/	2025-03-13T03:43:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/chasiv-yar-4.jpg
UK, France lead talks among 37 countries on 'coalition of the willing' in Ukraine, Bloomberg reports	London and Paris are leading discussions among 37 countries from Europe, Asia, and the Commonwealth on shielding Ukraine against any future Russian aggression in case of a peace settlement, Bloomberg reported on March 13, citing official sources. The &quot;coalition of the willing,&quot; which would provide security guarantees to Kyiv by sending peacekeeping troops, aircraft, or other support, was first presented by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer during the London summit on March 2, which hosted leaders of European nations and Canada. Officials from Australia, Japan, and New Zealand joined a follow-up meeting in Paris on March 11, expanding the potential coalition beyond the confines of NATO and Europe, undisclosed sources told Bloomberg. The U.S., which seeks to scale back its involvement in the Russia-Ukraine war and ruled out deployment of its own peacekeepers in the country, was not part of the discussions. The Trump administration has adopted a more confrontational stance toward Kyiv and Europe while seeking a reset of relations with Moscow. Kyiv&apos;s partners nevertheless hope to form a unified strategy to present to U.S. President Donald Trump and persuade him to commit some form of security guarantees, such as airpower or intelligence support, Bloomberg wrote. The coalition aims to form a &quot;reassurance force&quot; as a key security guarantee for Ukraine. Members who are reluctant to send their own troops to Ukraine can instead deploy soldiers to neighboring countries or provide ships, aircraft, intelligence, tanks, or other support, according to the outlet. Further details are to be discussed during a follow-up meeting this weekend. Russia has repeatedly rejected any presence of NATO peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a potential peace deal. Moscow has also been evasive on the issue of a 30-day ceasefire agreed upon between the U.S. and Ukraine. European countries have welcomed the proposed truce but stressed that security guarantees must be part of any stable peace deal. France, the U.K., and Germany also oppose Russia&apos;s efforts to demilitarize Ukraine, seeing the Ukrainian Armed Forces as the best possible security guarantee.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-france-lead-talks-between-37-countries-on-coalition-of-the-willing-in-ukraine-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-13T03:17:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2199562383.jpg
Trump's envoy Witkoff reportedly lands in Moscow as US seeks Russian agreement on ceasefire	A plane carrying Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s special envoy to the Middle East, has landed in Moscow, Russian pro-government media Interfax reported on March 13, citing aviation services. Witkoff&#x2019;s visit comes as the U.S. seeks Russian agreement on a proposed 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, which Kyiv accepted during talks in Jeddah on March 11. Washington subsequently resumed military and intelligence support for Ukraine after suspending it the previous week. The White House has not confirmed whether Trump plans to call Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the proposal. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has confirmed that U.S. negotiators are traveling to Russia but declined to reveal Moscow&apos;s position on the ceasefire proposal. U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz reportedly held a phone conversation with his Russian counterpart on March 12, and Witkoff is expected to meet with Russian officials, possibly including Putin, in Moscow. Witkoff previously traveled to Moscow in February for the release of U.S. teacher Marc Fogel from a Russian prison. Witkoff claimed he spoke directly with Putin for over three hours during his visit. According to Reuters, some U.S. officials and analysts fear Moscow could exploit the truce to deepen divisions between Washington, Kyiv, and their European allies while regrouping for further offensives.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-envoy-witkoff-reportely-lands-in-moscow-as-us-seeks-russian-approval-for-ceasefire/	2025-03-13T03:07:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196945288.jpg
Russian diesel exports to Africa reportedly plummet amid Ukrainian drone strikes	Russia has sharply reduced diesel exports to Africa following repeated Ukrainian drone attacks on its oil refineries, Russian pro-state media outlet RBC reported on March 13. Russian diesel exports to African countries nearly halved in February, dropping from 1.27 million tons in January to 684,000 tons, according to a report by the Price Index Center research project reviewed by RBC. Exports to Brazil fell by 41%, while deliveries to Turkey, Russia&apos;s largest diesel export market, declined by 12% to 1.13 million tons. &quot;The decline in exports is due to an increase in the number of incidents at refineries,&quot; the analysts said, referencing Ukrainian drone strikes. On March 10, Ukrainian military intelligence confirmed it had struck the Novokuybyshevsk oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Samara Oblast. A day earlier, a Ukrainian drone reportedly hit an oil depot in Cheboksary, Chuvashia Republic &#x2014; marking the first attack on the region. Ukraine considers Russian oil infrastructure a legitimate military target, arguing that fossil fuel revenues fund Moscow&apos;s war effort. Kyiv has systematically targeted Russian refineries, military sites, and logistics hubs to weaken Moscow&apos;s capacity to continue its full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-diesel-exports-to-africa-reportedly-plummet-amid-ukrainian-drone-strikes/	2025-03-13T02:48:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
Russia claims to retake Sudzha; Ukraine hasn't confirmed	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russian forces have retaken Sudzha, a key stronghold of Ukrainian troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed on March 13. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claim. As of late March 12, the Ukrainian military confirmed battles in the Sudzha area. Ukrainian troops had captured Sudzha, a town of 6,000 residents some 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s border, at the start of the Kursk incursion in August 2024. Military analysts from the DeepState monitoring group and the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank have also reported that Russia has partially or fully seized Sudzha, as Ukraine is allegedly withdrawing from the town. The news comes at the heels of a rapid Russian advance in the border region that seemed to have greatly diminished the Ukrainian salient. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, said on March 12 that Russia has retaken more than 86% of the territory in Kursk Oblast captured by Kyiv in mid-2024. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi acknowledged the &quot;difficult situation&quot; in the region but said that Ukraine will hold the defenses &quot;as long as reasonable and necessary.&quot; The Russian Defense Ministry also reported capturing the settlements of Melovoi and Podol as of March 13. The development comes as the U.S. seeks to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. Kyiv has sought to leverage its positions in Kursk Oblast in potential negotiations but began to rapidly lose its ground in the region at the same time that the U.S. temporarily paused military and intelligence support for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-to-retake-sudzha-kyiv-hasnt-confirmed/	2025-03-13T02:17:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2166312603.jpg
French National Assembly backs resolution on seizing Russian assets	France&apos;s National Assembly, the lower chamber of the country&apos;s parliament, passed a resolution calling for increased support for Ukraine and the seizure of frozen Russian assets, Le Figaro reported on March 13. The resolution, whose significance is largely symbolic, urges the European Union, NATO, and allied nations to boost political, economic, and military aid for Ukraine. It also calls for the EU to move forward with seizing Russia&apos;s frozen assets &#x2014; valued at approximately $300 billion, two-thirds of which are held in Europe &#x2014; to finance Ukraine&apos;s military needs and post-war reconstruction. Kyiv has only received loans covered by interest earned from the frozen assets. Despite fierce debate, the resolution passed with 288 votes in its favor. Fifty-four lawmakers from the left-wing France Unbowed and the Communist Party opposed it, while the far-right National Rally abstained. French lawmakers also amended the resolution to push for &quot;an independent European defense&quot; and to explore the possibility of deploying a European peacekeeping force to Ukraine once hostilities end. The proposal aligns with efforts by French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer to advance a European-led initiative to support Ukraine, particularly amid uncertainty from Washington. Macron has previously floated the idea of sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, a suggestion that sparked backlash from the Kremlin. A recent Elabe Institute poll cited by BFM TV on March 4 found that roughly two-thirds of the French public favor maintaining or increasing aid to Ukraine, as well as deploying peacekeepers after a ceasefire. France, one of Ukraine&apos;s most vocal backers, has taken a leading role alongside the U.K. in supporting Kyiv as U.S. President Donald Trump pressures European nations to increase their contributions. Trump has repeatedly criticized former U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration&apos;s level of aid to Ukraine, insisting that European allies should bear more of the burden.	https://kyivindependent.com/french-national-assembly-backs-resolution-for-more-ukraine-aid-seizure-of-russian-assets/	2025-03-13T01:57:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204111315.jpg
Polish president urges US to deploy nuclear weapons in Poland	Polish President Andrzej Duda called on the U.S. to deploy nuclear weapons in Poland as a deterrent against future Russian aggression, he said in an interview with the Financial Times published on March 13. &quot;The borders of NATO moved east in 1999, so 26 years later, there should also be a shift of the NATO infrastructure east. For me, this is obvious,&quot; Duda said. Duda suggested that U.S. President Donald Trump could relocate nuclear warheads stationed in Western Europe or the U.S. to Poland, arguing that Russia had already taken similar steps by deploying tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus. &quot;Russia did not even hesitate when they were relocating their nuclear weapons into Belarus,&quot; Duda said. &quot;They didn&apos;t ask anyone&apos;s permission.&quot; Duda said he recently discussed the idea with Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, and hopes to revive a nuclear-sharing proposal that he unsuccessfully presented to former U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration in 2022. The proposal comes amid mounting warnings from Western leaders and intelligence agencies about the possibility of a large-scale war in Europe within the next five years. Then-Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and his Belarusian counterpart, Viktor Khrenin, signed an agreement in May 2023 to transfer tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, Poland&apos;s neighbor. Russia&apos;s tactical nuclear weapons are designed for use on the battlefield in Europe and Asia and have a more limited range compared to strategic nuclear weapons, which could reach the U.S. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly issued nuclear threats against Ukraine and the West since launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. While those threats have not materialized, concerns persist over Russia&apos;s military ambitions beyond Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron has also signaled a shift in nuclear policy, saying on March 5 that France is open to extending its nuclear umbrella to protect European allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-president-duda-urges-us-to-deploy-nuclear-weapons-in-poland/	2025-03-13T01:18:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1676988608.jpg
Russia suspected of killing 5 Ukrainian POWs in Kursk Oblast	Russian forces allegedly executed five Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) in Kursk Oblast, Ukrainian Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets reported on March 13. Lubinets referred to a video circulating on social media that purportedly shows unarmed Ukrainian soldiers killed after being captured by Russian troops. According to Ukrainian activist Serhii Sternenko, a video of the suspected execution was recorded in Kursk Oblast, near the village of Kozacha Loknya. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. &quot;We once again see a cynical disregard for international humanitarian law on the part of the Russian army,&quot; Lubinets said, adding that he had sent letters to the U.N. and the International Committee of the Red Cross to document the suspected war crime. The news comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin made his first visit to Kursk Oblast on March 12 since Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into the region in August 2024. During the visit, which took place amid a rapid Russian advance, Putin declared that Ukrainian military personnel captured in the region &quot;will be treated as terrorists.&quot; Ukraine has previously documented widespread violations of the Geneva Conventions by Russian forces, including the execution of 177 captured Ukrainian soldiers as of mid-December 2024. The U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine reported a sharp rise in executions of Ukrainian POWs, documenting 79 extrajudicial killings across 24 separate incidents since August 2024. Visual evidence of such atrocities continues to emerge, reinforcing concerns over Moscow&apos;s systematic violations of international law.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-executed-five-ukrainian-pows-in-kursk-oblast-ombudsman-says/	2025-03-13T01:11:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2166040846.jpg
5 killed, 28 injured in Russian strikes against Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least five civilians and injured at least 28 over the past day, regional authorities reported on March 13. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 74 of the 117 drones launched by Russia overnight over 11 regions, the Air Force reported. Thirty-eight decoy drones disappeared from radars without causing damage, according to the statement. Russia also launched one Iskander-M ballistic missile from Kursk Oblast, the Air Force said without commenting on the consequences. Four people were injured in Russian attacks against Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, according to Governor Serhii Lysak. A drone attack against Dnipro, the regional center, set fire to an infrastructure facility and damaged residential buildings. The victims included three women aged 52, 56, and 82, according to the statement. A 64-year-old woman was also injured during the Russian attacks against the Nikopol district. Three people were killed and 14 injured during Russian attacks in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. This included two people killed and one injured in Myrnohrad, one killed and another injured in Pokrovsk, eight injured in Kostiantynivka, two injured in Druzhkivka, and two others injured in Oleksiievo-Druzhkivka, according to the statement. A 60-year-old man was injured during a Russian attack against the town of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Russian strikes killed one person and injured six in Kherson Oblast, said the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. Two apartment buildings and 20 houses were damaged. In Sumy Oblast, one civilian was killed in the Seredyna-Buda community when attempting to handle a Russian drone, which subsequently exploded. Two more people were injured during Russian attacks against the Khotin community, the regional military administration reported. An overnight drone strike against the Okhtyrka community also set ablaze multiple garages, though no casualties were reported. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, a 50-year-old man was injured during a Russian strike against the Vasylivka district, Governor Ivan Fedorov said.	https://kyivindependent.com/5-killed-28-injured-in-russian-strikes-against-ukraine-over-past-day/	2025-03-13T00:42:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-13_07-15-01-1.jpg
Russia presents US with demands for possible Ukraine peace deal, Reuters reports	Russia has presented the U.S. with a list of demands for a potential deal to end the war against Ukraine and reset relations with Washington, Reuters reported on March 13, citing two undisclosed sources. According to the sources, Russian and U.S. officials discussed these demands during face-to-face and virtual conversations over the past three weeks. These broad conditions are said to largely mirror those Russia has previously made to Ukraine, the U.S., and NATO. The exact content of the list remains unclear, however, as does the issue of whether Russia is willing to engage in peace talks with Kyiv before these conditions are met. Russia&apos;s previously voiced conditions have included Ukraine permanently abandoning NATO aspirations, prohibiting foreign troop deployments on Ukrainian soil, and recognizing Crimea and four partially occupied regions &#x2014; the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts &#x2014; as Russian territory. In June 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted that Ukraine must withdraw from those four regions as a precondition for negotiations. President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated on March 12 that Ukraine would not recognize any occupied territories as part of Russia in any future peace agreement. Despite U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s claim on Feb. 24 that Putin would allow European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a deal, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has rejected the idea. Russia has also continued to push its long-standing demand that the U.S. and NATO address what it calls the &quot;root causes&quot; of the war, including the alliance&apos;s eastward expansion. Ukraine officially submitted its application to NATO in September 2022. Though NATO members pledged that Ukraine&apos;s path toward membership is &quot;irreversible&quot; at the allied summit in Washington in 2024, the Trump administration has ruled out the accession in the foreseeable future. Trump is waiting to hear from Putin on whether Russia will agree to a 30-day ceasefire that Ukraine has already accepted on the condition that Moscow does as well. Ukraine agreed to the proposal for the temporary truce during talks in Jeddah on March 11, after which Washington resumed military and intelligence support. Putin&apos;s response to the ceasefire proposal remains uncertain. Some U.S. officials and analysts fear that Moscow will use the temporary pause to deepen divisions between Washington, Kyiv, and their European allies while preparing for further offensives, Reuters writes. The Washington Post reported on a document drafted by a Moscow think tank close to the Federal Security Service (FSB) that lays out Russia&apos;s potential maximalist demands for ending the war. These include a buffer zone in northeastern Ukraine along the borders of Bryansk and Belgorod oblasts and a demilitarized zone in southern Ukraine. The document, drafted in February, further calls for &quot;the complete dismantling&quot; of Ukraine&apos;s current government and says that peace is unlikely before 2026. It is unclear what &#x2014; if any &#x2014; role this document plays in the Kremlin&apos;s decision-making. Western security officials told Bloomberg on March 10 that Putin has deliberately set &quot;maximalist&quot; demands on territorial concessions, peacekeepers, and Ukraine&apos;s neutrality, knowing they are likely unacceptable to Kyiv and European nations.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-presents-us-with-demands-for-possible-ukraine-war-deal-reuters-reports/	2025-03-13T00:13:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1251592140.jpg
Ukrainian drones set ablaze Russian factory, infrastructure site overnight, authorities claim	Ukraine attacked six Russian regions with close to 80 drones overnight on March 13, with fires reported at an infrastructure site in Voronezh Oblast and an industrial plant in Kaluga Oblast, according to Russian authorities. Kyiv has carried out regular long-range drone strikes against military and industrial facilities in Russia&apos;s rear, seeking to undermine its ability to wage its all-out war. Russian air defenses downed 77 drones overnight, including 30 over Bryansk Oblast, 25 over Kaluga Oblast, six over Kursk and Voronezh oblasts each, and five over Rostov and Belgorod oblasts each, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed. Drone wreckage set fire to a building of an industrial enterprise in Dzerzhinsky district in the northern part of Kaluga Oblast, Governor Vladislav Shapsha said. The fire has been extinguished, but one employee received a minor injury, the governor claimed. Drone debris also reportedly damaged a cell tower and a power line in the Khvastovichsky district, the southernmost part of Kaluga Oblast. Kaluga Oblast lies in the western part of Russia, bordering Moscow Oblast from the west. An unspecified infrastructure facility was damaged in the evening of March 12 in Voronezh Oblast, a region bordering Ukraine&apos;s Luhansk Oblast, Governor Alexander Gusev said on his Telegram channel. No casualties were reported. The targeted facility was part of the region&apos;s gas infrastructure, the Baza Telegram channel reported, citing residents. A fallen drone also started a fire in the village of Kalininsky in Rostov Oblast, but the nearby industrial facility was not damaged, according to Governor Yuri Slyusar. Airports in Penza, Saratov, and Volgograd imposed temporary flight restrictions overnight, Russia&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency announced. The full extent of possible damage is being determined. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified. The strikes come only two days after Ukraine launched what appears to be its largest drone strike against Russia, deploying over 330 drones across 10 different regions to attack oil facilities and other strategic sites.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-set-ablaze-russian-factory-infrastructure-site-overnight-authorities-claim/	2025-03-12T23:30:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/chasiv-yar-4.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 890,250 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 890,250 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on March 13.

White House won't confirm if it has mechanisms to enforce ceasefire with Russia	White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to say whether or not the U.S. has enforcement mechanisms in the event Russia violates a potential ceasefire when speaking to reporters on March 12. Ukrainian and U.S. officials met in Saudi Arabia for talks on March 11. At the conclusion of negotiations, Ukraine agreed to a U.S. proposal for a temporary 30-day ceasefire, so long as Russia complies with the terms. When asked whether the U.S. has enforcement mechanisms in place to ensure Russia abides by the ceasefire, Leavitt declined to comment. &quot;Well, that&apos;s obviously a grand hypothetical question that I won&apos;t comment on, because we&apos;re not there yet,&quot; Leavitt told reporters on March 12. Leavitt confirmed U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz had a telephone conversation with his Russian counterpart earlier in the day and that Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff is traveling to Moscow in the coming days to discuss the ceasefire. &quot;The current state of play is that the Ukrainians have agreed to a ceasefire, the Ukrainians have agreed to the peace plan that was put on the table yesterday in Saudi Arabia,&quot; Leavitt said. Negotiations are now &quot;on the tenth yard line of peace,&quot; Leavitt said, and it is &quot;up to the Russians to agree to this plan.&quot; Leavitt did not confirm if U.S. President Donald Trump plans to call Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the ceasefire proposal. &quot;(I)f that call happens, he will let you guys know,&quot; she said. Trump said on March 12 that American officials are already on their way to Russia to negotiate a ceasefire. It was also previously reported that Witkoff is expected to meet with Putin during an upcoming visit to Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/white-house-declines-to-say-if-it-has-enforcement-mechanisms-for-russia-in-potential-ceasefire/	2025-03-12T22:00:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200647187.jpg
EU parliament accuses US of 'blackmailing' Ukraine in joint declaration	EU lawmakers passed a wide-ranging joint declaration on March 12 condemning the U.S. for &quot;blackmailing&quot; Ukrainian leadership into capitulating to Russia. The declaration comes a day after Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office announced it was ready to accept Washington&apos;s proposal of a 30-day ceasefire, so long as Russia also complies with the terms. When Kyiv agreed to the plan, Washington resumed previously suspended shipments of military aid. The joint statement &quot;strongly deplores any attempts at blackmailing Ukraine&apos;s leadership into surrender to the Russian aggressor for the sole purpose of announcing a so-called &apos;peace deal.&apos;&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin is now being &quot;rewarded&quot; for Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, the resolution says. The declaration accuses the U.S. of trying &quot;to negotiate a ceasefire and peace agreement with Russia over the heads of Ukraine and other European states.&quot; It also denounces the U.S. for being &quot;counterproductive and dangerous.&quot; Support for Ukraine must be increased in the face of the foreign policy shift in Washington, the joint declaration says. The lawmakers proposed to further &quot;increase the effectiveness and impact of sanctions on Russia in order to definitively undermine Russia&apos;s ability to continue waging its brutal war of aggression against Ukraine and threatening the security of other European countries.&quot; The resolution was passed by 440 lawmakers in the European Parliament, which consists of 720 seats. Signatories included members of many political parties, including Greens, Socialists &amp; Democrats, Christian Democrats, and far-right conservatives. The U.S. has infuriated many lawmakers in Europe by repeatedly saying it will exclude the continent from potential Ukraine peace negotiations. Top European officials have decried the White House for pandering to Russia. Despite the condemnation from members of the European Parliament (MEPs), European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on March 12 praised the outcome of Ukraine&apos;s recent talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia and reaffirmed the EU&apos;s support for the embattled nation.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-parliament-accuses-us-of-blackmailing-ukrainian-leader-in-joint-declaration/	2025-03-12T21:21:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1246737828-1.jpg
Europe-bound Chinese rail shipments through Russia plummet due to transit restrictions	Russian restrictions and the seizure of dual-use goods have caused Europe-bound rail shipments from China via Russia to plunge, The South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on March 11. Russian authorities in October banned the transit of dual-use military and civilian goods to Europe via its territory. The restrictions apply to a range of goods that could potentially aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Since the ban, rail cargo volumes through Russia from China have been declining for months as Chinese logistics companies lose confidence in the trade route, industry players told SCMP. &quot;We have not dared to ship (goods through Russian rail routes) since November,&quot; Andrew Jiang, general manager of Shanghai freight forwarding company Air Sea Transport, said. Russia&apos;s new restrictions have caused Chinese rail shipments to be sent to Europe via alternative routes that bypass Russia. These include routes through Central Asian countries, such as Kazakhstan. Many Chinese freight companies learned about the restrictions weeks after their implementation. This has caused thousands of containers to be seized by Russian authorities. Moscow&apos;s restrictions allow Russian authorities to seize and keep hard-to-get Western-sanctioned goods. These items can then be used to manufacture weapons for the war against Ukraine. Russian authorities have confiscated large amounts of equipment that on the surface appear to be harmless, such as welding materials, metal fasteners, and airplane parts, importers of Chinese goods in Russia told the Moscow Times. Russian importers now face difficulty obtaining goods from Chinese suppliers due to a lack of confidence in Russian freight routes. China has become Russia&apos;s key economic partner, supplying Moscow with critical dual-use goods as sanctions have increasingly isolated the country from the global market. Russia has come to rely heavily on China since the launch of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-bound-chinese-rail-shipments-through-russia-plummet/	2025-03-12T20:16:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2160158492.jpg
Journalist Viktoria Roshchyna receives posthumous human rights award	Viktoria Roshchyna, a Ukrainian journalist who died in Russian captivity, was posthumously awarded the 2024 Homo Homini Human Rights Award by the Czech human rights organization &#xA0;People in Need on March 12. Sevgil Musayeva, the chief editor of the Ukrainian media outlet Ukrainska Pravda, accepted the honor on Roshchyna&apos;s behalf at a ceremony in Prague, activist Maksym Butkevych announced on social media. Roshchyna shares the award with Nigerian journalist Philip Obaji. Roshchyna received the Homo Homini award for her &quot;courage to tell the stories of Ukrainians in the Russian-occupied territories and for her long-term journalistic work dedicated to portraying issues threatening the democratic order of Ukraine, which she did not compromise on, even at the risk of her personal safety,&quot; the executive board of People in Need said. The journalist disappeared in August 2023 while reporting in Russian-occupied territory, with Moscow admitting her detention the following year. Previously, in March 2022, Roshchyna was detained for 10 days by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers while leaving Berdiansk in the direction of Mariupol. As a condition of her release, she was forced to record a video saying Russian forces had saved her life. Ukrainian officials confirmed Roshchyna&apos;s death on Oct. 10, 2024, but said that the circumstances were still under investigation. &#xA0; The Media Initiative for Human Rights, a Ukrainian NGO, reported in October 2024 that Roshchyna had been held in at least two notorious Russian prisons: the penal colony n. 77 in Berdiansk in occupied Ukraine and the detention center n. 2 in Russia&apos;s Taganrog. Both facilities are known for the use of torture against prisoners. Roshchyna was taken out of Taganrog detention center sometime in September 2024. According to Russia, she died on Sept. 19. Ukrainian prosecutors have classified Roshchyna&apos;s death as a war crime and murder.	https://kyivindependent.com/journalist-viktoria-roshchyna-receives-posthumous-human-rights-award/	2025-03-12T18:55:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/roshchyna.jpeg
Ukraine out of ATACMS missiles, AP reports	Ukraine has no more long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) in its arsenal, the Associated Press (AP) reported on May 12, citing unnamed U.S. and Ukrainian officials. The news comes as the U.S. resumes the flow of military aid to Kyiv after talks with Ukrainian delegates in Saudi Arabia on March 11. Washington suspended weapons shipments in early March. A U.S. official and Ukrainian lawmaker confirmed to the AP that Ukraine currently has no remaining ATACMS missiles. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to provide details on the status of the weapons. ATACMS are U.S.-supplied ballistic missiles can fly up to 300 kilometers (about 186 miles). Former U.S. President Joe Biden eased restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of ATACMS in November 2024, allowing Kyiv to launch them against military targets in Russia. The U.S. sent Ukraine less than 40 long-range ATACMS in total, the U.S. official told the AP. According to the official, Kyiv ran out of the missiles in January. The New York Times (NYT) reported in December 2024 that Kyiv was near the end of its supply of ATACMS and was limiting their use. Kyiv first began receiving older, shorter-range versions of ATACMS in fall of 2023. In the spring of 2024, the U.S. began shipping updated models with a range of up to 300 kilometers. &#xA0;At the time, Ukraine was only permitted to deploy these missiles against targets in occupied Ukrainian territory. Following Biden&apos;s change in policy &#x2014; which was accompanied by permission from the U.K. to attack Russia with British long-range Storm Shadows &#x2014; Ukraine launched a series of missile strikes against Russian airfields, military facilities, and weapons factories. U.S. President Donald Trump has previously said he disagreed &quot;very vehemently&quot; with the decision to permit Ukrainian long-range strikes against Russia with American weapons. Deliveries of U.S. weapons resumed this week after senior Ukrainian officials met with White House representatives in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on March 11. Washington imposed a freeze on military aid following a heated exchange between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. At the conclusion of the Jeddah talks, Ukraine announced that military aid had resumed and agreed to accept Washington&apos;s proposal for an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, provided that Moscow abides by the terms of the ceasefire simultaneously.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-out-of-atacms-missiles-ap-reports/	2025-03-12T18:01:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/ep30-take-4-01.png
Fires reported at infrastructure facilities in Russia's Voronezh and Rostov regions following drone strikes	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Infrastructure facilities in Russia&apos;s Voronezh and Rostov regions caught fire following multiple drone strikes, governors Alexander Gusev and Yuri Slyusar reported on March 12. In the Voronezh region, two unnamed infrastructure facilities were allegedly shelled, one of which caught fire. Russian air defenses reportedly shot down five drones in the Rostov region, with one falling on the territory of an industrial facility. Local residents reported that the drones targeted gas infrastructure. No casualties were reported, according to the acting governors&#x2019; statements. The Kyiv Independent is unable to immediately verify the reports. The attack comes amid an uptick in Ukraine&#x2019;s drone operations targeting Russian energy infrastructure. Kyiv has particularly taken aim at Russia&apos;s fossil fuel infrastructure as part of its strategy to undermine funding for the Kremlin&apos;s war operations. Both regions border Ukraine to the west. Voronezh is located around approximately 279 kilometers (173 miles) northeast of Kharkiv., and Rostov Oblast borders Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.	https://kyivindependent.com/fires-reported-at-infrastructure-facilities-in-russias-voronezh-and-rostov-regions-following-drone-strikes/	2025-03-12T16:30:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1258999936.jpg
Putin reportedly makes first visit to Kursk Oblast since start of incursion	Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 12 reportedly made his first visit to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast since Ukraine&apos;s incursion into the region began in August 2024. Putin, in a video released by the Kremlin, reportedly met with military leadership in the region while visiting an undisclosed command post in Kursk Oblast. The Kyiv Independent cannot independently verify the details or location of Putin&apos;s reported visit. The Ukrainian military has not publicly commented on the claims. The reported visit into the region comes amid a renewed Russian offensive in the region, with Russian troops reportedly having regained control of more than 86% of the territory in Kursk Oblast captured by Kyiv. Russian troops have entered Sudzha, a key Ukrainian-held stronghold in the Russian border region of Kursk. In the video, Putin is seen donning military attire for the first time since Russia&apos;s full scale invasion began in February 2022 &#x2014; instead of the suit that he typically wears for meetings with military personnel. The choice in attire mimics that of President Volodymyr Zelensky who has refused to wear a suit throughout the war &#x2014; symbolizing Zelensky&apos;s wartime leadership. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on March 10 that there is no immediate threat of encirclement as Ukrainian forces are repositioning to &quot;favorable defense lines.&quot; Syrskyi added on March 12 that Ukraine will hold the defense in Kursk Oblast &quot;as long as reasonable and necessary.&quot; Ukraine launched the cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially seizing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. Since then, Russian forces, reinforced by North Korean troops, have steadily pushed back against Ukrainian forces. Over seven months of fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Russian losses have reached nearly 54,900 personnel, with over 22,000 killed, Syrskyi claimed on March 12.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-reportedly-makes-first-visit-to-kursk-oblast-since-start-of-ukraines-incursion/	2025-03-12T14:43:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/d072c83-----_690x387.jpg
30-day ceasefire deal may be struck within days, Rubio says	A 30-day ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine may be finalized within &quot;days,&quot; U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on March 12. The temporary ceasefire agreement is contingent on whether Russia agrees to halt hostilities. Ukraine agreed to the U.S.&apos;s proposal for a 30-day truce during talks in Jeddah on March 11, after which Washington resumed military and intelligence support for Kyiv. The U.S. is expected to discuss the proposal with Russia in the coming days. &quot;Here&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;d like the world to look like in a few days: Neither side is shooting at each other &#x2014; not rockets, not missiles, not bullets, nothing, not artillery&quot; Rubio said in an airport in Ireland when asked about potential discussions regarding Ukraine ceding territory. &quot;The shooting stops, the fighting stops, and the talking starts.&quot; Reuters reported on March 12, citing Russian sources, that Russia is unlikely to agree to a temporary truce in Ukraine proposed by the U.S., feeling it has the upper hand on the battlefield and viewing the ceasefire as a trap. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov gave an evasive answer when asked about the U.S. proposal, explaining that the topic must first be discussed with the American side. Any ceasefire agreement would have to take Russia&apos;s battlefield advances into account and provide &quot;guarantees&quot; to Moscow, sources told the news agency. In the past, Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top officials have ruled out a temporary ceasefire that would freeze the conflict along the current front lines. U.S. President Donald Trump has warned that Russia could face &quot;devastating&quot; financial consequences if it chooses to continue its all-out war against Ukraine. &quot;There are things you can do that wouldn&apos;t be pleasant in a financial sense,&quot; Trump said. &quot;It would be very bad for Russia. I don&apos;t want to do that, because I want to get peace.&quot; Russia continues to occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory and made steady advances in Donetsk Oblast in late 2024. While Russia&apos;s advance in Ukraine&apos;s east has reportedly stalled earlier this year, Moscow&apos;s troops seemed to have made rapid gains in Kursk Oblast, the Russian border region where Ukraine has been fighting since August 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/30-day-ceasefire-deal-may-be-struck-within-days-rubio-says/	2025-03-12T13:39:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194552772.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Kyiv ready to fight in Kursk Oblast 'as long as necessary' as Russia claims to retake over 86% of seized territories	Key developments on March 12: Russian troops have regained control of more than 86% of the territory in Kursk Oblast captured by Kyiv, Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the General Staff of the Russian army, said on March 12, while Ukraine said it was ready to fight as long as needed. His claims come as multiple Ukrainian and Russian sources reported that Russian troops had entered Sudzha, a key Ukrainian-held stronghold in the Russian border region of Kursk. Following Gerasimov&apos;s reports, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi confirmed ongoing battles in the suburbs of Sudzha and the surrounding areas. &quot;In the most difficult situation, my priority has been and remains to save the lives of Ukrainian soldiers. To do this, the units of the Defense Forces, if necessary, maneuver to more favorable positions,&quot; said Syrskyi. He added that Ukraine will hold the defense in Kursk Oblast &quot;as long as reasonable and necessary.&quot; According to Gerasimov, Russian forces have recaptured 24 settlements and 259 square kilometers (100 square miles) of territory in Kursk Oblast. Russian news agency Tass published purported footage showing Russian President Vladimir Putin visiting one of the Russian troops&apos; control centers in Kursk Oblast, which is claimed to have marked his first trip to the embattled region since the beginning of Kyiv&apos;s incursion. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. The Ukrainian military has not publicly commented on the claims. Putin ordered to regain control over the entire territory of Kursk Oblast and to consider creating a &quot;security zone&quot; along the border with Ukraine, Tass wrote. Russia is seeking to push Ukrainian troops out of Kursk Oblast and move the fighting to Sumy and Kharkiv oblast. The Russian president also said that Ukrainian soldiers captured in Kursk Oblast should be labeled as &quot;terrorists.&quot; Russia&apos;s General Staff claimed that over 400 Ukrainian troops have been taken captive in the region. Over seven months of fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Russian losses have reached nearly 54,900 personnel, with over 22,000 killed, Syrskyi claimed on March 12. Ukraine wanted to demonstrate to U.S. President Donald Trump and its European partners that it is serious about ending the war, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 12 about why Kyiv agreed to Washington&apos;s temporary truce proposal. While Ukraine initially proposed a partial ceasefire that would extend only to aerial and naval operations, U.S. delegates proposed a full truce during talks with Ukrainian officials in Jeddah on March 11. After receiving the proposal, Zelensky said Ukraine was &quot;ready for a 30-day ceasefire format offered by the U.S. side.&quot; &quot;I have repeatedly stressed that none of us trust Russia... but we will not play with narratives that we want the war to continue,&quot; Zelensky said at a press conference. &quot;I am very serious, and it is important for me to end the war. I want the U.S. president to see this; so that Europe and everybody unites to push Russia toward ending the war.&quot; The Ukrainian president also noted that the ceasefire would be only the first step toward a full peace. After the war ends, martial law will be lifted, and elections will be held, he added. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed on March 12 that Ukraine-U.S. talks in Saudi Arabia on March 11 included discussions about potential &quot;territorial concessions&quot; as part of a negotiated settlement with Russia. &quot;Yeah, we&apos;ve had conversations,&quot; Rubio said in an airport in Ireland when asked about potential discussions regarding Ukraine ceding territory. The Trump administration has repeatedly said that both Kyiv and Moscow will have to make compromises for a peace deal, calling Ukraine&apos;s goal of restoring its pre-2014 borders &quot;unrealistic.&quot; Russian forces currently occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine, from where reports of systematic repression, torture, and forced deportations regularly emerge. Rubio also said that the Jeddah talks covered &quot;what a negotiation process would look like&quot; and reiterated, &quot;There is no military solution to this conflict.&quot; The official acknowledged that Ukraine requires security assurances to deter possible future Russian aggression and emphasized that &quot;Europeans will need to be involved in this regard.&quot; Trump has so far refused to offer such security guarantees, saying during his Feb. 28 meeting with Zelensky that responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security should fall on Europe. Small Russian infantry groups have stepped up assault operations in Ukraine&apos;s south over the past two weeks as they look to improve Moscow&apos;s battlefield positions, a spokesperson for the military told Ukrinform on March 12. Thirty-five attacks have been recorded in the area today so far, with Russian forces pushing on the Huliaipole and Orikhiv sectors in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, said Vladyslav Voloshyn, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command. &quot;This is not an offensive or part of the enemy&apos;s strategic actions, but tactical attempts to improve their position relative to the combat line,&quot; Voloshyn said. Russia has also intensified artillery shelling and air and missile strikes on Ukraine&apos;s Tavria group of forces, which covers Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, Voloshyn said.

Ukraine Business Roundup — The foreign arms producer showing real results in Ukraine	The following is the March 11, 2025 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. For all the hype around foreign weapons producers setting up shop in Ukraine to help it fend off Russia&#x2019;s invasion, they have little to show for it. With the exception of the Prague-domiciled conglomerate Colt CZ, which has set up assembly of its Bren 2 assault rifles inside Ukraine, reporter Kollen Post writes in his latest. The Ukraine-assembled rifle &#x2014; dubbed the &#x201C;Sich&#x201D; for the center of life of the Ukrainian historical nomad-warrior Cossacks &#x2014; offers swappable components for alternating between Soviet and NATO calibers. Ondrej Bohac, head of public sector at Colt CZ, said that something in the &#x201C;upper tens of thousands&#x201D; are already in Ukrainian hands and &#x201C;tens of thousands should be assembled (in Ukraine) this year.&#x201D; The company&#x2019;s ultimate goal is to &#x201C;get rid of Ukrainian dependence on Soviet weapons, like the AK-47, and not only on the weapons themselves but also on the ammunition, which is still produced mainly in Russia and Belarus,&#x201D; Bohac told Post. Ukraine does not seem close to running through its old stockpiles of ammunition, but as with the conversion from Soviet 122 and 152 mm artillery to NATO-standard 120 and 155 mm, the transition is a long-term Western turn. Many international arms giants have announced plans to build their wares inside of Ukraine, ranging from Rheinmetall to Northrop Grumman to Baykar, but those projects have mostly stalled out, writes Post. Colt CZ is one of the first to set up production, putting the firm in a relative frontier position. Its experience will be a bellwether for NATO-based weapons manufacturers expanding to Ukraine. Read the full profile here. Ukraine&apos;s Central Bank raised the key policy rate from 14.5% to 15.5% per annum from March 7, adding that it was ready to take further steps to curb growing inflation in the country. The move marks the second raise of the key policy rate since the beginning of 2025. In late January, the central bank raised it from 13.5% to 14.5%. Inflation reached its highest level in about 18 months in January as a result of a lower harvest, growing business costs, particularly energy, and continued Russian attacks. Price growth was expected to peak sometime in the middle of this year, but tense relations with the Donald Trump administration have soured expectations. Pyshnyi also warned of increasing risks due to less favorable economic trends caused by &quot;further geopolitical polarization of countries&quot; and &quot;the corresponding fragmentation of global trade.&quot; Preident Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Friday, Feb. 28, 2025 (Jim Lo Scalzo / Getty Images)Minerals deal: Will it ever happen?After the Oval Office showdown a couple of weeks ago and the subsequent collapse of the minerals agreement, everyone in town is wondering what&#x2019;s up with the deal. Some reports have suggested that in retaliation for an argument in the White House, Trump was negotiating for a &#x201C;better deal.&#x201D; But multiple sources have told the Kyiv Independent that the details of the agreement haven&#x2019;t changed, and that it&#x2019;s more a matter of when the two sides will sign it &#x2014; which remains unclear. It could all hinge on this week&#x2019;s meetings in Saudi Arabia. Trump&apos;s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News that he was &#x201C;really hopeful&#x201D; that President Volodymyr Zelensky would return to the U.S. to sign the deal in the near future. Ukraine&#x2019;s government plans to spend $2.6 billion purchasing 4.5 million first-person-view (FPV) drones this year as part of a large-scale effort to equip its military with advanced technologies, the Defense Ministry said on March 10. Ukraine purchased 1.5 million drones in 2024, with 96% of spending going to Ukrainian producers. A Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support to Kyiv. The agency funded school reconstruction, bomb shelters, critical energy repairs, and civil society initiatives. A Russian attack on Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure overnight on March 7 forced Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy company DTEK to shut down one of its gas production facilities in Poltava Oblast. Meanwhile, DTEK is in talks with U.S. suppliers to bring more natural gas to Europe, Wall Street Journal reported. Ukraine&apos;s largest state-owned energy company, Naftogaz, and Poland&apos;s petroleum refineries company, Orlen, have signed a contract for the supply of approximately 100 million cubic meters (mcm) of liquefied natural gas (LNG), Naftogaz announced on March 7. As Russia continues targeting Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure, domestic gas production has declined due to Russian strikes, forcing Ukraine to increase imports. Ukraine has received 752 million pounds ($970 million) as the first installment of the U.K.&apos;s contribution to the G7 loan covered by frozen Russian assets, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on March 7. &quot;The funds will go towards strengthening Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities,&quot; Shmyhal said on X.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-business-roundup-the-foreign-arms-producer-showing-real-results-in-ukraine/	2025-03-12T12:37:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/production_cz_04.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 17	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 17 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from March 3&#x2013;9, 2025. The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Ukraine&#x2019;s President signs IMF-mandated budget code amendments on public investments President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky has signed draft law #12245, introducing amendments to the budget code to enhance the management of public investment projects. The legislation fulfills one of the International Monetary Fund&apos;s structural benchmarks. The reform establishes a general public investment fund, which will be allocated by the newly formed Strategic Investment Council within the government &#x2014; a body that mirrors the composition of the Cabinet of Ministers. Under the new framework, multiple budget allocations will be consolidated into this &#x201C;fund of funds.&quot; The government will then oversee its distribution across priority projects. Ukraine&#x2019;s Parliament to vote on two Ukraine Facility bills Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, is set to hold final votes on two legislative proposals tied to the country&#x2019;s commitments under the Ukraine Facility program. Lawmakers will consider draft law #8222, which introduces a new civil service pay structure based on Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development SIGMA principles. The bill aims to classify government positions by function and align public sector wages with the private sector. Over the next five years, salaries for government employees are expected to reach 70-90% of the equivalent private-sector compensation for positions of similar complexity and responsibility. The reform is a requirement of Ukraine Plane under the Ukraine Facility program, with a Q1 2025 deadline. Additionally, parliament will review draft law #11290, which is said to be aimed at strengthening cybersecurity measures and enhances protection of state information resources. Anti-Corruption Committee to review ARMA reform bill ahead of final vote The parliamentary committee on anti-corruption policy is set to review draft law #12374-d, a piece of legislation aimed at reforming the Asset Recovery and Management Agency (ARMA), ahead of its second and final reading in parliament. The bill introduces a competitive selection process for ARMA&#x2019;s leadership, granting international experts a decisive vote in the selection commission. Under the Ukraine Facility program, the legislation must be fully adopted by March 31, 2025, to meet Ukraine&#x2019;s international reform commitments. Ukrainian government allocates additional Hr 570 million for delayed payments under winter support and national cashback programs The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has allocated Hr 570 million (approximately $13.5 million) from the state budget&#x2019;s reserve fund to cover delayed payments under the winter support program and the national cashback program. The decision follows a public statement by the Economy Ministry, which cited operational issues as the reason for payment delays for December and January. The funding will be used to ensure beneficiaries receive their overdue financial assistance. Last week, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal confirmed that the national cashback program would be extended for the coming years, signaling continued government support for the initiative.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-17/	2025-03-12T12:32:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1398149194.jpg
Russian intelligence recruited teenagers for terrorist attack in western Ukraine, SBU claims	Russia&apos;s intelligence service blew up two teenagers it had recruited to carry out a terrorist attack in the western city of Ivano-Frankivsk on the evening of March 11, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) reported on March 12. Explosions were reported near the railway station and in a high-rise building in Ivano-Frankivsk. One person was killed and three other injured, authorities said. The remote detonation of self-made devices used in Russian intelligence planned attacks is a new tactic of Moscow&apos;s in its covert operations against Ukraine, allowing it to carry out attacks while getting rid of perpetrators, Serhii Andrushchenko, SBU&apos;s deputy head, previously told the Kyiv Independent. According to law enforcement, the recruited agents were two teenagers aged 15 and 17 who sought quick money on Telegram channels. Russian intelligence services allegedly recruited them online and offered payment for carrying out a series of terror attacks in the city. A Russian handler rented an apartment for the teenagers in a high-rise building near the local railway station, the SBU said. Following Russia&apos;s instructions, the two made explosives and two devices disguised as thermoses. They equipped both explosives with remote detonators, according to the SBU. The teenagers were allegedly heading to a designated location to place one of the explosive devices when the Russian intelligence service activated the explosives in their package. Another explosive was detonated in the rented apartment. The 17-year-old boy was killed, and the 15-year-old was hospitalized with serious injuries. Two passers-by &#x2014; a 20-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman &#x2014; also suffered injuries. If charged, the 15-year-old could face life imprisonment. In February, the SBU reported that Russia recruited the attacker responsible for a deadly explosion at a military enlistment office in Rivne. Russia also recruited minors via social media to set fire to military cars parked in Ukrainian cities, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said. Last year, cases of setting fire to military vehicles were recorded in Kyiv, Odesa, and Dnipro.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-intelligence-behind/	2025-03-12T12:23:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/7c4dbf1182188d844e1b5b7ca0c7016c.jpg
There will still be war' — Ukraine's soldiers on ceasefire proposal, Russia, and Putin	The &quot;ball is in (Russia&apos;s) court,&quot; U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on March 11 after Kyiv and Washington emerged from talks in Saudi Arabia in agreement over a ceasefire proposal. After the negotiations with Washington, Ukraine announced that it was ready to accept a 30-day-long ceasefire if Russia also complied with it. Now, all eyes are on Moscow as it mulls a response to the proposal, but expectations are not high &#x2014; even if a ceasefire comes into force, Moscow has a long history of disregarding them. After Russia invaded Ukraine&apos;s east with the use of proxies and annexed Crimea in 2014, Moscow violated multiple ceasefire deals 25 times, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a meeting with Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. We asked five serving Ukrainian soldiers what they thought of the ceasefire proposal and if they think Russia will agree to its terms. I&#x2019;m not sure that Russia will agree to a ceasefire. Trump wants to show that he&#x2019;s the only one making decisions in this situation, but Putin is unlikely to dance to the tune of a U.S. president. However, if Russia does agree to a ceasefire, it means their situation is worse than it seems. In that case, it&#x2019;s a clear signal that the pause should be short, and Russia must be pressured even harder on the front line.

(Alice Martins/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)&apos;Veter&apos; former company commander, just returned to the military after a few months break. Fought in Donbas in 2014-2018 during previous &apos;ceasefires&apos; with Russia And when will they reach an agreement? It could take a day or a year to reach an agreement. This has legalized Russia at the negotiating table. The murderer is now sitting among the prosecutor and the judges. And he is given every right to say that he is not a murderer. They will now start bargaining, and what will they bargain with? With Ukraine, our state, our lands, our people. And what will these 30 days do, even if there is a truce and the shooting stops? Has no one thought about what will come after them? Has anyone thought that Russia will then go further and accumulate forces and means? Russia has a strategic plan for 2035 to capture Ukraine along the east bank in its entirety or even the entire country. They will not deviate from this plan. They will take a break for 30 days to replenish their forces, resources, etc., and then move forward. The question here is what we will do in the meantime. In Ukraine, during this period, there should be heavy manpower reinforcements (in the army) and 100% replenishment of ammunition and equipment. Starting with small arms, ending with aviation, and everything in between. Because here we often think, &#xA0;&#x201C;Oh, that&apos;s it, the war is on hold, we can sit and have a smoke.&#x201D; And everyone will sit on their asses until the storm hits again and the Russians push on. And when they do, everyone will start shouting again, &#x201C;Give us weapons urgently, give us people urgently.&#x201D; I have seen previous &#x201C;truces&#x201D; in Donbas. There was a ceasefire, a &#x201C;harvest truce,&quot; and we were standing on Krymske (in Luhansk Oblast). &#xA0;Their subversive groups were working constantly. I was the acting platoon commander. They hit my position with a Pion (a Soviet self-propelled 203 mm cannon). There were dead and wounded. No one stopped anything, it was just a &quot;light version&quot; (of the war). We&apos;ve been through this before. An agreement with the Russians is not worth the paper it is written on. 26-year-old military service woman Regarding the 30-day ceasefire, it is a good opportunity to show the world that Ukraine is most interested in peace. No other country in the world is as interested in ending this war as Ukraine. And the main thing is the conditions under which we do this. We have already seen what Trump has proposed. It does not work. It is too stupid to use the same non-working scenario and repeatedly fall into the same trap. Fortunately, we learn from our mistakes and do not want to make the same mistakes for the second, third, or tenth time. However, we must show the international community that Ukraine is more interested in peace than anyone else. Suppose there are 30 days of silence in Ukraine without missiles or drones. In that case, it would be a good opportunity to invite international representatives to Ukraine, show our capital, show different cities, show the front-line areas without danger to their lives, show how the military lives, and invite as many journalists as possible. We can do a lot in a month. Of course, the military will be able to rest and recover a bit. Their loved ones can travel to (Ukraine&#x2019;s) east and spend time with them without worrying about their safety. &#x491; I&apos;m sure not every military member will be allowed to go on vacation. But there is an opportunity to visit loved ones safely.

This time will be the same because I don&apos;t see that Russia is ready to start a ceasefire. I don&apos;t think it will change anything for me. There will still be war, it will still be the same job. But maybe, if there really is a ceasefire, it will be good that we can rotate our troops and organize some rest for some of our soldiers. sapper 25th Airborne Brigade I don&#x2019;t think Russia will follow through (with a ceasefire). They never keep their word. We went through this in 2014-2015. But I do really hope for a ceasefire, &#xA0;all the guys are very worn out and broken.	https://kyivindependent.com/there-will-still-be-war-ukrainian-soldiers-on-ceasefire-proposal-russia-and-putin/	2025-03-12T11:51:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2198799645.jpg
Trump said Ukraine is 'more difficult to deal with' than Russia — that might be about to change	Over the course of a tumultuous few weeks of talks, U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed his frustration with Kyiv. On March 7, Trump declared that he finds it &quot;more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine&quot; than Russia. Yet, after weeks of strong-arming Ukraine into submission, the Trump administration is yet to ask Russia for a single concession, and real negotiations with the Kremlin have yet to actually begin. According to experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent, some of them with direct experience of diplomatic dealings with Moscow, the reality of coming up against Russian President Vladimir Putin in talks may come as a shock to Trump. &quot;I think (Putin) probably sees Trump as a useful idiot who is helpful in promoting his agenda,&quot; Ryhor Nizhnikau, a Russia expert at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, told the Kyiv Independent. Nizhnikau expects the Kremlin to reject the proposed ceasefire and come back with counter-proposals in an attempt to draw out the negotiating process, putting forward what he describes as &quot;a lot of dangerous ideas.&quot; Kyiv and Washington on March 11 emerged from talks in Saudi Arabia in agreement over a ceasefire proposal, as well as the resumption of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing. After the negotiations with Washington, Ukraine announced that it was ready to accept a 30-day-long ceasefire if Russia also complied with it. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio later said the &quot;ball is in (Russia&apos;s) court,&quot; adding if the Kremlin rejects the ceasefire proposal, &quot;then we&apos;ll, unfortunately, know what the impediment is to peace here.&quot; There had been no official response from the Kremlin, and even state TV propagandists had been largely silent on the matter. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov when asked by journalists about the proposal gave an evasive answer, saying they were &quot;getting a little ahead of yourselves.&quot; &quot;The Russians will definitely reject the ceasefire,&quot; Nizhnikau said. &quot;They cannot accept it because they say it&apos;s Washington&apos;s plan.&#x201D; Previous statements from Kremlin officials give an indication of what Russia is likely to demand. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan, National Security Advisor Mosaad bin Mohammad al-Aiban, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Ukrainian Head of Presidential Office Andriy Yermak, and Ukrainian Minister of Defense Rustem Umerov attend a meeting between the U.S. and Ukraine hosted by Saudi Arabia in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11, 2025. (Salah Malkawi/Getty Images)Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Feb. 17 there could be &quot;no thought of&quot; territorial concessions, suggesting Russia may well demand Ukraine withdraw from areas of the four oblasts &#x2014; Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk &#x2014; it illegally annexed in 2022 despite not fully controlling. Although Kyiv may be forced to agree to some sort of territorial concessions, it has previously rejected a full withdrawal from all four oblasts. Putin, however, said such a move would be a prerequisite for peace talks. How Russia&apos;s latest territorial demands will be met by Washington remains to be seen but Ambassador Kurt Volker, who served as the U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations in 2017-2019 and U.S. ambassador to NATO in 2008-2009, said it&apos;s likely that Trump will have anything but an easy time. &quot;I think he has some kind of belief that Putin has limited and reasonable demands, which is not the case. Putin has unlimited demands,&quot; he said. Volker believes that as negotiations continue and Trump&apos;s stated aim of a swift end to war moves further away, he will become &quot;very disappointed in Putin&quot; because he &quot;keeps moving the goalposts and upping the ante.&quot; There is also a self-inflicted wound that hobbles the U.S. as it enters talks in earnest with Russia &#x2014; the Trump administration has already thrown away some of its strongest cards. The White House has ruled out NATO membership for Ukraine and insisted it makes territorial concessions, with the return to pre-2014 and even pre-2022 borders taken off the table. &quot;They&apos;re giving Putin everything,&quot; Michael McFaul, former U.S. Ambassador to Russia and professor of international studies at Stanford University, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It&apos;s just like diplomacy 101 &#x2014; in any negotiation, you don&apos;t start by giving away all your strongest cards before the negotiation has started. And that&apos;s what it looks like the Trump team is doing.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelenskiy speaks at a news conference in Kyiv, Ukraine, on March 12, 2025. Zelenskiy calls for a period of monitored &quot;silence&quot; on the frontline before the 30-day truce proposed by the U.S. (Andrew Kravchenko/Bloomberg via Getty Images)McFaul said that Russia will have been emboldened by these concessions and will now simply demand more from the negotiating process. &quot;They just put it in their pocket, and they say, &apos;Well, what are you going to give us now?&apos; That&apos;s their strategy. And they sit quietly, and they wait,&quot; he said. McFaul added that the original maximalist aims of Putin&apos;s full-scale invasion &#x2014; the &quot;demilitarization&quot; of Ukraine and the removal of President Volodymyr Zelensky &#x2014; are very much still on the table, in large part because the U.S. has been agreeing with Russia and its demands. &quot;It&apos;s an incredibly bad negotiating strategy on behalf of the Trump team,&quot; McFaul added. What the U.S. could do, or would be prepared to do, in order to impose Ukraine&apos;s demands for a satisfactory peace upon a maximalist Russia remains to be seen, but Trump on March 12 appeared upbeat. Following announcing that he might speak with Putin this week, Trump emphasized the need to engage with Russia, expressing hope that Putin would also agree and that negotiations could move forward. &quot;It takes two for tango, as I have already said, so I hope he (Putin) will also agree as well, and I really think that would be 75% of the way, the rest is getting it documented,&quot; he said. &quot;Ukraine has agreed to it, and hopefully Russia will agree to it&#x2026; hopefully, we&apos;ll be able to wipe out a deal,&quot; he added. But McFaul points out another potential impediment to the Trump team&apos;s success &#x2014; experience. &quot;Lavrov&apos;s been at this for over two decades, he&apos;s pretty good at it. Rubio just started in this job a few weeks ago. And, you know, maybe he&apos;s just trying to figure out how to do this,&quot; he said. Regardless of whether or not U.S. negotiators can step up, for Russian-born columnist and political commentator Sergei Parkhomenko, negotiations and any thoughts of a genuine peace process are wishful thinking. &quot;Putin needs this war,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;He needs this war for its own sake more than he needs a victory in it, more than he needs Ukraine and more than he needs anything else. &quot;For him, war is a way of life, a method of governing the country, a way of maintaining himself in power. Therefore, real peace directly contradicts his political interests.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-said-ukraine-is-more-difficult-to-deal-with-than-russia-that-might-be-about-to-change/	2025-03-12T10:41:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203994697.jpg
US officials heading to Russia for ceasefire talks, Trump says	American representatives are on their way to Russia to discuss a proposed 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 12 during a meeting with Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin in the White House. &quot;We have people going to Russia right now,&quot; Trump said. Speaking to journalists in the Oval Office, the U.S. president said Washington has &quot;some positive messages about a possible ceasefire.&quot; He added that a potential of the temporary truce is now up to Russia. Kyiv agreed to a temporary ceasefire proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia also did. The talks in Saudi Arabia also led to the U.S. restarting key military and intelligence support for Ukraine. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov gave an evasive answer when asked about the U.S. proposal, explaining that the topic must first be discussed with the American side. Trump also warned that Russia could face &quot;devastating&quot; financial consequences if it chooses to continue its all-out war against Ukraine. &quot;There are things you can do that wouldn&apos;t be pleasant in a financial sense,&quot; he said. &quot;It would be very bad for Russia. I don&apos;t want to do that, because I want to get peace.&quot; Shortly after his inauguration, Trump said that the U.S. can impose tariffs and sanctions on Russia to force their hand in negotiations, saying &quot;we can do it the easy way or the hard way.&quot; Recently, however, Washington reportedly considered easing sanctions on Russian oil, a major source of funding for the war in Ukraine. Earlier in a day, Reuters reported citing undisclosed Russian sources that Moscow is unlikely to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine, feeling it has the upper hand on the battlefield and viewing the ceasefire as a trap. In the past, Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top officials have ruled out a temporary ceasefire that would freeze the conflict along the current front lines. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kyiv doesn&apos;t trust Russia but wanted to show to Trump and European partners that Ukraine is serious about ending Russia&apos;s full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-delegation-heading-to-russia-for-ceasifire-talks-trump-says/	2025-03-12T10:34:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203672248.jpg
Ukraine struggles to hold on in Kursk Oblast as Russia strikes back before peace talks	Ukraine&#x2019;s retreat from Kursk Oblast appears more likely as the latest news shows Russia taking ground amid intense attacks to drive Ukraine out, experts and soldiers say. Retaking Ukrainian-held territory in Kursk Oblast could leave Kyiv without its hard-fought bargaining chip before potential negotiations with Russia. In recent days, Russian forces have destroyed Ukrainian logistics in Kursk Oblast, claimed to capture several settlements, and reportedly entered the key town of Sudzha. Soldiers on the ground told the Kyiv Independent on March 7 that with &#x201C;zero logistics&#x201D; left, some would like to withdraw. Ukraine&#x2019;s military leadership said on March 10 that there was no threat of encirclement for Ukrainian troops and ordered reinforcements. President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a briefing on March 12 that Ukrainian forces continue to fulfill tasks in Kursk Oblast, while the command is &#x201C;preserving the maximum of lives of our soldiers.&#x201D; The news comes as U.S. officials plan to meet with Russian representatives in the coming days to consider a temporary 30-day ceasefire discussed during U.S. talks with Ukraine in Saudi Arabia on March 11. &#x201C;Before any talks between Russia and the U.S., the Russians are trying to resolve (the Kursk problem) as quickly as possible, concentrating all the forces they can,&#x201D; Mykhailo Samus, military expert and director of the New Geopolitics Research Network, told the Kyiv Independent. Russians have brought their most effective drone units to Kursk Oblast, who are now fire-controlling Ukrainian logistic routes, thanks to Russia&#x2019;s advances on the right and left flanks of the salient, experts say. In Kursk Oblast, logistics are good &#x2014; with good roads and enough settlements where Ukrainian troops can reside and build shelters, Ruslan Mykula, a military analyst and co-founder of the DeepState OSINT project told the Kyiv Independent. But the main problem for Ukrainian forces is a section of about 10 kilometers of the main highway in Ukraine&#x2019;s Sumy Oblast between the village of Yunakivka and the Sudzha border crossing. &#x201C;Formally, all the logistics are tied to the Sumy-Sudzha asphalt highway, which is very easy to control, because the distances (to the enemy) there are not very long, about 5-7, maximum 15 kilometers, which is not a problem for modern drones,&#x201D; a retired military officer and defense expert Viktor Kevliuk told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Logistics routes are also not so numerous because the area is either swampy or bridges are destroyed,&#x201D; he added. Oleksandr, who serves in intelligence of the 82nd brigade that participates in the Kursk incursion, shows a video of his unit&apos;s drone destroying Russian equipment in Sumy, Ukraine on Nov. 6, 2024. (Oksana Parafeniuk for The Washington Post via Getty Images)A soldier fixes a drone underground in a Ukrainian military position in Ukrainian-controlled territory in Kursk Oblast, Russia on Aug. 18, 2024. (Ed Ram / For The Washington Post via Getty Images)&#x201C;This operation turned into something similar to Krynky,&#x201D; Mykula said, referring to the village in the Russian-occupied east bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson Oblast held by Ukrainian forces for about nine months in 2023-2024. Ukrainians lost hundreds of soldiers during the dangerous river crossings &#x2014; the only conventional logistics route to Krynky. &#x201C;The road between Yunakivka and the (Kursk Oblast) border is like the Dnipro River (near Krynky), where every infantryman or vehicle can be hit by first-person-view (FPV) drones day and night,&#x201D; Mykula explained. While regular FPV drones are counteracted by electronic warfare equipment used by both Ukrainian and Russian forces, it is powerless against fiber-optic-controlled drones that use an exceptionally long wire unraveled during the flight. Some can fly up to 20 kilometers. &#x201C;Not all, but most of the fiber-optic crews in the Russian army are now in the Kursk Oblast. There is a huge concentration of drones there,&#x201D; Mykula said. According to Mykula, Ukrainian forces in Kursk Oblast never found a way to counteract this type of drone. Having cut logistics, Russian forces have pushed on the ground in the past several days. According to Kevliuk, Russian forces are trying to advance both with small infantry groups overnight or during low visibility to avoid drones and on high-speed vehicles such as motorcycles, civilian cars, quad bikes, and golf carts during the day, driving over minefields to quickly storm Ukrainian positions. On March 8, reports emerged that some Russian sabotage and assault groups had used an underground gas pipe to try to gain a foothold on the outskirts of Sudzha, emulating a similar operation where Russians used the sewers in Avdiivka. Ukraine&#x2019;s General staff published a video on March 9, claiming the destruction of those units. But according to open-source monitoring groups, on March 12, the fighting is ongoing in Sudzha. The Ukrainian military has not commented on Russian forces entering the town as of this publication. Other attacks are targeting alternative Ukrainian logistic routes that are known to Russians, according to Mykula. &#xA0; &#x201C;The (North) Korean soldiers&#x2019; offensive near Guevo (on Ukraine&#x2019;s right flank) had a clear task to enter the logistics route of the defense forces through the forest, which they did,&#x201D; Mykula said. A North Korean POW captured by Ukrainian forces during hostilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Photo published on Jan. 11, 2025. (President Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)It could also be a move to encircle Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast. As part of these efforts, Russia has deployed two battalions of North Korean special forces, far better-prepared than previous North Korean soldiers sent to the area to fight, Kevliuk said. &#x201C;But the encirclement is not working so far, and it will not work in the future because the enemy simply does not have enough troops to do it,&#x201D; he added. Ukraine&#x2019;s continued incursion in Kursk Oblast has had two main goals, experts say. First was gaining Ukraine leverage in possible peace talks, where Ukrainian-controlled areas of Russia could be exchanged for some Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories, according to Ukraine&#x2019;s leadership. The second goal was to divert Russian forces from other parts of the front line, prevent further attacks on Ukraine&#x2019;s Sumy Oblast, and take the fight to Russian soil. When the Kursk incursion began in August 2024, Russia&#x2019;s leadership decided to keep the momentum in Ukraine&#x2019;s east instead of diverting them to Kursk Oblast, according to experts. While Russia made small yet steady territorial gains in the east, it failed to achieve all of its major goals for 2024, Samus said. &#x201C;Pokrovsk is not occupied, and Chasiv Yar, Toretsk, and Kupiansk are not occupied. (The Russians) did not enter Dnipropetrovsk Oblast,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Now, there are 60,000 of not the worst Russian soldiers and North Korean soldiers (in Kursk Oblast), trying to resolve this issue before the start of negotiations between Russia and the United States,&#x201D; he added. However, the original idea that Ukraine&#x2019;s foothold in Kursk Oblast could affect negotiations held more weight before the U.S. President Donald Trump got involved, Samus says. &#x201C;This could be said before Trump, when the politics were formed traditionally, in some adequate, comprehensible ways.&#x201D; U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 30, 2025. (Oliver Contreras/AFP via Getty Images)If Trump and his administration continue to act in a way that contributes to Russia&apos;s interests &#x2014; halting military aid, denying Ukraine&#x2019;s security guarantees before peace talks, and lifting sanctions on Russia &#x2014; they might also decline to consider Kursk Oblast as a bargaining chip, Samus said. The U.S. restored its military assistance to Ukraine on March 11 after the talks in Saudi Arabia, and Ukraine said it would agree to the temporary 30-day ceasefire if Russia did the same. It was not immediately clear what the fate of Ukraine-controlled Kursk Oblast would be during any possible ceasefire. &#x201C;If (the Kursk region) cannot be traded at the strategic level, then (Ukraine&#x2019;s military command) must decide from an operational and tactical point of view whether it is more efficient to withdraw and use these forces in other areas,&#x201D; Samus said. Some experts say that Ukraine can stabilize the logistics and keep its foothold in Kursk Oblast if it sends more resources. But others, as well as soldiers on the ground, suggest that the Ukrainian retreat has already begun. Ukrainian troops are using &#x201C;very well-built&#x201D; Russian fortifications, well-concealed and fitted for local topography, which would allow them to stay there for a long time, according to Kevliuk.

One Ukrainian soldier who asked for anonymity to discuss sensitive matters told the Kyiv Independent that his unit had recently withdrawn from Kursk Oblast, losing almost all of their vehicles. &#x201C;It was a horror what was happening on that road,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We don&apos;t know what will happen next.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-struggles-to-stay-in-kursk-oblast-until-negotiations-during-russias-new-push/	2025-03-12T09:49:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2166040846.jpg
Russia has stepped up attacks in Ukraine's south over past two weeks, military says	Small Russian infantry groups have stepped up assault operations in Ukraine&apos;s south over the past two weeks as they look to improve Moscow&apos;s battlefield positions, a spokesperson for the military told Ukrinform on March 12. Thirty-five attacks have been recorded in the area today so far, with Russian forces pushing on the Huliaipole and Orikhiv sectors in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, said Vladyslav Voloshyn, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command. &quot;This is not an offensive or part of the enemy&apos;s strategic actions, but tactical attempts to improve their position relative to the combat line,&quot; Voloshyn said. Russia has also intensified artillery shelling and air and missile strikes on Ukraine&apos;s Tavria group of forces, which covers Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, Voloshyn said. Voloshyn&apos;s statement come amid Russia&apos;s breakthrough in embattled Kursk Oblast. Multiple Ukrainian and Russian sources claimed on March 12 that Russian troops had entered Sudzha, a key Ukrainian-held stronghold in the Russian border region of Kursk. Previously, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine&apos;s offensive into Kursk Oblast prevented Russian forces from carrying out large-scale operations in northeastern and southern Ukraine. Parts of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts have been occupied by Russian forces since the full-scale invasion of 2022. The regions remain a regular target of Russian aerial attacks. The Ukrainian military warned in fall 2024 that Russian forces were amassing in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in preparation for a southern offensive. Heavy fortifications were constructed around the regional capital of Zaporizhzhia ahead of the possible renewed push.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-has-stepped-up-attack-in-ukraines-south-over-past-two-weeks-military-says/	2025-03-12T09:24:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2074365868.jpg
Ukraine won't recognize occupied territories as Russian as part of any peace deal, Zelensky says	Ukraine will not recognize any occupied territories as part of Russia under a potential future peace agreement with Moscow, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on March 12. &quot;We are fighting for our independence. Therefore, we will not recognize any occupied territories as Russia&apos;s. This is a fact,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Our people have fought for this, our heroes died. How many injured, how many passed. No one will forget about it... This is the most important red line. We will not let anyone forget about this crime against Ukraine.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s comments come a day after Kyiv agreed to a 30-day ceasefire put forth by the U.S. during the talks between the two countries in Jeddah. Ukraine said it was ready to move forward with the ceasefire if Russia did the same. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio later confirmed that Ukraine-U.S. talks in Saudi Arabia on March 11 included discussions about potential &quot;territorial concessions&quot; as part of a negotiated settlement with Russia. The Trump administration has repeatedly said that both Kyiv and Moscow will have to make compromises for a peace deal, calling Ukraine&apos;s goal of restoring its pre-2014 borders &quot;unrealistic.&quot; Russian forces currently occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine, from where reports of systematic repression, torture, and forced deportations regularly emerge. While a ceasefire and peace deal could freeze the war along current front lines, Ukraine is unlikely to ever recognize Russian-occupied territories as legally part of Russia. Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts are partially controlled by Russian troops. Russia claims to have annexed the whole territory of those regions in 2022 despite not controlling two regional capitals &#x2014; Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Moscow also controls all of Ukraine&apos;s Crimean peninsula. When asked about sanctions or other steps to put pressure on Russia in case of violation of the ceasefire, Zelensky said that this move would depend on the U.S. side.d &quot;If they (Russians) are not ready (for a ceasefire), we do hope that the American side will demonstrate exactly what it said,&quot; the president added. Senator Lindsey Graham called for sanctions against Russia if Moscow refuses from a proposed ceasefire. He promised to introduce new congressional sanctions targeting Russia and nations that continue to buy Russian goods, including oil, gas, and uranium. In the past, Russia has ruled out a temporary ceasefire that would freeze the conflict along the current front lines. Russian nationalist voices and pro-war bloggers have already spoken out against the U.S.-backed proposal.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-wont-recognize/	2025-03-12T08:36:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203160376.jpg
Ex-envoy to Russia slams Trump's negotiating strategy as 'incredibly bad'	The Kyiv Independent&apos;s Chris York sits down with Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia and political scientist, to discuss the Ukraine-Russia peace negotiations, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s approach to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the ideological parallels between Putinism and MAGA.	https://kyivindependent.com/ex-envoy-to-russia-slams-trumps-negotiating-strategy-as-incredibly-bad/	2025-03-12T08:19:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_9383.jpg
Losing foothold in Kursk Oblast would be 'politically significant,' experts say	As Russian troops are set to push Ukrainian soldiers out of Kursk Oblast, experts say Kyiv&apos;s withdrawal from the region could be &quot;politically significant.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s seven-month-long hold of a small portion of Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast might be ending. On March 12, Russian troops entered the town of Sudzha, which served as Ukraine&apos;s main stronghold in the region. Fearing encirclement, Ukrainian troops have begun to pull back closer to the border. The news comes a day after Ukraine had agreed to the U.S. proposal for a 30-day-long ceasefire. The Kremlin said &quot;it was studying the proposal.&quot; &quot;It feels like we&apos;re getting to a position where people are trying to settle the front lines in anticipation that we might have a set of negotiations,&quot; said Scott Lucas, a political scientist and professor of American Studies and International Politics at University College Dublin&apos;s Clinton Institute. Western and Ukrainian experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent said that Ukraine has already achieved certain political objectives by invading Russia in the first place and holding onto parts of Kursk Oblast for months. Kyiv will now have to decide whether it should reinforce the Kursk salient by sending more troops and resources that could be deployed elsewhere, or organize a retreat to avoid what could be a disastrous scenario on the ground. &quot;Ukraine wants to be able to show that it continues to stand and to resist, even as the Trump administration walks away,&quot; Lucas said, referring to the U.S.&apos; cutting off its military aid and intelligence sharing earlier in March. The U.S. on March 11 agreed to lift the ban on intelligence sharing following talks with the Ukrainian side in Saudi Arabia. However, the future U.S. support &#x2014; and Europe&apos;s readiness to take the lead in providing Ukraine with military aid &#x2014; remains uncertain.

(Fermin Torrano / Anadolu via Getty Images)And losing a foothold in Russia may have an impact on the mood both inside and outside Ukraine. Kyiv has repeatedly pointed out the success in Kursk Oblast even as Russian troops advanced significantly along the front lines in Donetsk Oblast, capturing long-time Ukrainian strongholds of Vuhledar, and Kurakhove. Both Kyiv and Western countries have labeled the partial occupation of Kursk Oblast as a crucial bargaining chip for possible peace negotiations when the time comes. &quot;(Ukraine&apos;s) position in Kursk is an important one because certainly it&apos;s something that would factor in any negotiation that may come about in the coming year,&quot; then U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters in January. Russia&apos;s inability to protect its own territory last August and its decision to pursue further invasion of Ukraine at the cost of keeping safe its own territory resulted in &quot;negative sentiments&quot; domestically, according to Oleksiy Melnyk, the co-director of foreign policy and international security at the Kyiv-based think tank Razumkov Center. &quot;It&apos;s not about the city of Sudzha or square kilometers, but about Russian territorial integrity,&quot; Melnyk said. But it may have been a poor decision for Kyiv to publicly discuss its openness for trading the Kursk salient for Ukrainian territory, he added. Earlier in February, President Volodymyr Zelensky told the Guardian that he planned to play the Kursk card in potential negotiations to &quot;swap one territory for another&quot; without clarifying which part of Russian-occupied territory Kyiv would ask for in return. Disclosing Ukraine&apos;s negotiation position has likely served &quot;as a digger&quot; for Moscow to concentrate its effort to deprive Ukraine of such a leverage, he stressed. A checkpoint with Ukrainian military personnel in Sudzha, Russia, on Aug. 16, 2024. (Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)Moscow is currently accelerating its push in Kursk Oblast, with the Russian Defense Ministry claiming on March 11 that it recaptured 12 settlements and 100 square kilometers (40 square miles) of territory there. Ukrainian troops on the ground have told the Kyiv Independent in recent days that the situation is ever more critical, as the logistics were hampered. Russian forces have gained ground south of Sudzha, potentially cutting off some Ukrainian positions from the rest of the salient. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, denied threats of encirclement. Losing the Kursk salient would likely not result in a further decline of U.S. support as &quot;we can&apos;t get into negative numbers in that sense,&quot; according to Steven Horrell, a non-resident senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis. Hanging onto the Kursk Oblast territory is an important bargaining chip &quot;in the international eyes,&quot; with the operation allowing Ukraine to show Western countries that it can still strike back despite battlefield setbacks, Horrell said. &quot;I think the surge of (Western) support after the Kursk offensive was concrete proof of that,&quot; he added. Now, with the operation seemingly dying out slowly, Ukraine&apos;s potential retreat from Kursk Oblast can reinforce U.S. President Donald Trump and his team&apos;s point that &quot;there is no way Ukraine can win,&quot; Horrell said. &quot;Losing Kursk, people begin to question whether or not you just have to simply give up,&quot; Lucas said.	https://kyivindependent.com/losing-foothold-in-kursk-oblast-would-be-politically-significant-experts-say/	2025-03-12T08:01:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2166312596.jpg
Kremlin quiet on ceasefire proposal, Russian milbloggers call it 'pure treachery'	Moscow has remained tight-lipped over the news that Ukraine has accepted a full 30-day ceasefire proposal during negotiations with the U.S. in Jeddah on March 11. After the negotiations with Washington, Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office announced that it was ready to accept the terms if Russia also complied with the agreement. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio later said the &quot;ball is in (Russia&apos;s) court,&quot; adding if the Kremlin rejects the ceasefire proposal, &quot;then we&apos;ll, unfortunately, know what the impediment is to peace here.&quot; By the afternoon of March 12, the only thing close to an official Russian position on developments was an evasive answer from Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov when asked by journalists about the proposal. &quot;Look, you are getting a little ahead of yourselves. We don&apos;t want to do that,&quot; he said, explaining the topic must first be discussed with the American side. Prominent Russian state TV propagandists are also uncharacteristically quiet on the topic. Vladimir Solovyov stuck to official reports coming out of the meeting during the day, while Olga Skabeyeva simply asked, &quot;What would we get in return?&quot; But less constrained by the official Kremlin line, Russia&apos;s vibrant and vocal community of pro-war military bloggers, or milbloggers, were more forthcoming in their appraisal of the ceasefire proposal. &#x201C;Any ceasefire at this stage is pure treachery and sabotage,&quot; the milbogger channel Ngp Razvedka, which has almost 100,000 subscribers, said. &quot;The Ukrainian Armed Forces are holding on with their last strength, and it is possible to roll into Sumy on their shoulders,&quot; it added. The theme of a ceasefire being an opportunity for Ukrainian forces to regroup and rearm was repeated by several other milbloggers &#x2014; Two Majors, which has over 1.2 million subscribers, said the pause in fighting would allow them to &quot;lick their wounds.&quot; Ukrainian soldiers stay underground awaiting orders in Sumy Oblast, Ukraine, on Sept. 30, 2024.

(Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)&quot;The truce proposal is actually Minsk-3, which will give the Ukrainian Armed Forces an opportunity to strengthen and rearm,&quot; milblogger Yuriy Podolyaka, told his more than 3 million subscribers. &quot;After that, the war will continue in much worse conditions for us. Therefore, we will not agree, that much is obvious.&quot; Some of the anger was also directed at U.S. President Donald Trump. Millblogger Vladislav Evtushenko, told his 10,000 subscribers that the &quot;right thing to do would be to shoot the old man in the other ear,&quot; referencing the failed assassination attempt on Trump last year. According to reports, Russia is unlikely to agree to the temporary truce, feeling it has the upper hand on the battlefield and viewing the ceasefire as a trap, Reuters reported on March 12, citing undisclosed Russian sources. Any ceasefire agreement would have to take Russia&apos;s battlefield advances into account and provide &quot;guarantees&quot; to Moscow, sources told the news agency. In the past, Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top officials have ruled out a temporary ceasefire that would freeze the conflict along the current front lines. Russia continues to occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory and made steady advances in Donetsk Oblast in late 2024. While Russia&apos;s advance in Ukraine&apos;s east has reportedly stalled earlier this year, Moscow&apos;s troops seemed to have made rapid gains in Kursk Oblast, the Russian border region where Ukraine has been fighting since August 2024. One source told Reuters that a ceasefire could weaken Russia&apos;s position, as the West could pin the blame on Moscow should it fail to end the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-quiet-on-ceasefire-proposal-russian-milbloggers-call-it-pure-treachery/	2025-03-12T07:31:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1255667814.jpg
Temporary ceasefire or redrawing borders? What ‘territorial concessions’ mean to Ukraine, Russia, and the US	After Ukrainian and U.S. officials met in Saudi Arabia for peace deal talks to end the war with Russia, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed on March 12 that potential &quot;territorial concessions&quot; from Ukraine were part of the discussion. Since U.S. President Donald Trump was inaugurated in January and opened talks with the goal of ending the war quickly, members of his administration have repeatedly expressed that Ukraine will need to drop its long-standing demand that any end to the war involves a full return of captured territories. In recent months, Kyiv has relented and signaled that it is open to some sort of territorial concessions, inching closer to compromise between the two parties at war. But even with concessions potentially on the table, the parties in the conflict still have a stark divide to bridge. While a gulf remains between Russia and Ukraine on what territory could be up for negotiation, they also stand at odds on a far more basic question: how to define territorial concessions. &#x201C;The phrase &#x2018;territorial concessions&#x2019; means different things to different state actors,&#x201D; George Barros, who heads the Russia and geospatial intelligence teams at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), said in a written response to Kyiv Independent questions. Clarifying what the different sides mean when they use the phrase is &#x201C;key to understanding the opposing negotiating positions and the fraught information environment surrounding peace negotiations,&#x201D; he said.

(Salah Malkawi/Getty Images)Russia&#x2019;s demands: Ukrainian &#x2018;capitulation&#x2019;Russia&#x2019;s demands for concessions include the complete relinquishing by Ukraine of four oblasts &#x2014; Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. These oblasts contain wide swathes of territory that Ukraine currently controls, including the regional capitals of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. The four oblasts provide a valuable connection by land from Russia to Crimea, an autonomous region of Ukraine that Russia illegally annexed in 2014. Such a concession would transfer more land to Russia than simply freezing the current battle lines, where Russia currently controls around 20% of Ukraine&#x2019;s territory. In December, Russia said that a full withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from these oblasts would be a requirement to begin peace talks, a demand that Kyiv rejected. Not only is Russia seeking control of these territories, it is also seeking legal recognition from Ukraine and the U.S. that these territories belong to Russia. &#x201C;These demands are tantamount to a full Ukrainian and U.S. capitulation and would undermine the international-rules based order,&#x201D; said Barros. Last month, Russia also ruled out the idea of a territorial exchange &#x2014; exchanging land currently controlled by Russia for portions of Ukrainian-occupied Kursk in Russia. It is currently pushing forward in Kursk and regaining territory that Ukraine has held since the surprise offensive in August. In September 2022, Russia illegally enshrined ownership in its constitution over the four oblasts it now demands after illegal sham referendums in occupied territories, a move that holds no weight internationally. The move, however, complicates Russia&#x2019;s calculus in negotiations, said Andreas Umland, an analyst at the Stockholm Center for Eastern European Studies (SCEES). If Moscow formally agreed in negotiations that any of these territories do not legally belong to Russia, it would set a precedent Russian President Vladimir Putin is likely hoping to avoid, he explained. &#x201C;If there is some sort of compromise from Russia&#x2019;s side on territories that, according to its constitution, officially belong to Russia, then this could be a model for future breakups from the legitimate territory of Russia,&#x201D; Umland said. If a crisis broke out in a border region of Russia that wanted to break away, they could follow the model for changing or breaking the constitution to make that happen &#x201C;the same as was done in these Ukrainian territories,&#x201D; he said. Unlike Russia, Ukraine&#x2019;s position on territorial concessions has shifted over time. For the first years of the war &#x2014; and as recently as late last year &#x2014; Ukraine maintained it wouldn&#x2019;t negotiate any peace deal that didn&#x2019;t include a full restoration of Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereign land. Ukraine has demanded a return to its 2014 borders, prior to Russia&#x2019;s seizing of Crimea and a small area of the Donbas, though some see the 2022 borders as a more viable option, meaning the territory Ukraine held prior to the full-scale invasion. That position has softened in recent months as territory and troop losses mount during the third year of Russia&#x2019;s invasion and as the U.S. ramps up pressure on Ukraine to reach a quick settlement. While Ukraine now signals that it could accept the temporary occupation of territories Russia has seized, President Volodymyr Zelensky has underscored that Ukraine would still retain its legal claims to the land. &#x201C;We cannot legally acknowledge any occupied territory of Ukraine as Russian,&quot; Zelensky said in November. Ukraine is also not offering any concessions of land that Russia does not currently control.

(Andreas Arnold/picture alliance via Getty Images)The willingness among Ukraine&#x2019;s people to make territorial concessions to end the war quickly is at an all-time high, but the view is still in the minority, according to polling from the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published on Jan. 3. The poll found that around 38% percent of Ukrainians were open to conceding territory in a peace deal, up from 8% in December 2022. The number of Ukrainians who oppose giving up territories under any circumstances, &#x201C;even if this would prolong the war and threaten the preservation of independence,&#x201D; stands at 51%, according to the poll. A Gallup poll released in November 2024, however, found that just over half of Ukrainians were open to territorial concessions, compared with 38% who were not. Zelensky faces pressure to make a deal, but Ukrainian people are split over what type of deal is acceptable, said Umland of SCEES. &#x201C;I think that is also one of Russia&apos;s strategies,&#x201D; said Umland. &#x201C;They want to create this contentious issue in Ukraine.&#x201D; Neither poll clarified whether territorial concessions meant signing over land to Russia or an agreement where Ukraine would acknowledge occupation while still retaining its claim to the land. Russia and Ukraine&#x2019;s stances on territorial concessions are clear, if incompatible. What the U.S. means when it demands territorial concessions is far less explicit. Under the previous U.S. administration, former President Joe Biden ruled out handing land to Russia. &#x201C;The United States will never, never, never recognize Russia&apos;s claims on Ukraine&apos;s sovereign territory,&quot; U.S. President Joe Biden said on Sept. 29, 2022, after Russia illegally annexed Ukraine&#x2019;s four eastern oblasts. Trump&#x2019;s approach, however, has been far more transactional and no longer emphasizes Ukrainian sovereignty. U.S. President Donald Trump exits a Tesla Model S on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, DC, on March 11, 2025. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Trump reportedly said he wanted to see that Ukraine is willing to make territorial concessions before he restarted military aid to and intelligence Ukraine after cutting it in March, but hasn&#x2019;t specified what this could look like. Intelligence sharing and military aid were restored on March 11, after Ukraine and the United States agreed to a plan for a 30-day ceasefire. Whether Russia will agree to the terms is unknown. A Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on March 7 that it hadn&#x2019;t received any official proposals for territorial concessions. Earlier in March, Zelensky called for more clarity on the U.S.&#x2019;s position. Ahead of the March 11 talks in Saudi Arabia, a source in Zelensky&#x2019;s office responded to a question about what the Ukraine team expected to learn: &#x201C;Finally hearing what the Americans want from the negotiations.&quot; &#x201C;It&#x2019;s unclear what the U.S. is seeking in terms of territorial concessions,&#x201D; ISW&#x2019;s Barros said. &#x201C;For the U.S., there is a principled model for how to deal with wars of conquest: non-recognition of occupied territory. The U.S. never officially recognized the Soviet Union&#x2019;s occupation of the Baltic States, for example.&#x201D; After the Soviet army invaded and occupied the Baltic countries in 1940, Acting U.S. Secretary of State Sumner Welles issued a diplomatic statement known as the Welles Declaration. It condemned the Soviet Union&#x2019;s invasion and refused to recognize the Soviet-declared annexation of this territory. The statement &#x201C;lays out a principled blueprint&#x201D; for how the U.S. could handle a situation where Russia continued to occupy Ukrainian land without legally recognizing it, Barros added. The U.S. hasn&#x2019;t said whether it would follow a similar model. &#x201C;The stark reality is that Ukraine has offered some concessions to get to the negotiating table (concessions on territorial integrity) whereas the Russian side has not budged at all, and demands territorial concessions on lands that Russian forces haven&#x2019;t occupied on the battlefield,&#x201D; Barros said.	https://kyivindependent.com/temporary-ceasefire-or-redrawing-borders-what-territorial-concessions-mean-to-russia-ukraine-and-the-us/	2025-03-12T07:12:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201827435.jpg
Ukraine's military 'preserving maximum of lives of our soldiers' in Kursk Oblast, Zelensky says	Ukrainian troops operating in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast continue in their tasks despite intense Russian pressure, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a briefing on March 12. &#x201C;The military command is doing what it should do, preserving the maximum of lives of our soldiers,&quot; Zelensky said, urging a &quot;sober&quot; assessment of the battlefield situation rather than reacting to Russian information warfare. His remarks come as multiple Ukrainian and Russian sources claimed that Russian troops had entered Sudzha, a key Ukrainian-held stronghold in the Russian border region of Kursk. Russian news agency TASS published purported drone footage showing that Russian troops had entered the town center and raised a Russian flag. The Ukrainian military has not publicly commented on the claims. Roman Kostenko, secretary of the parliamentary defense committee, acknowledged that the situation in Kursk Oblast is &quot;complicated&quot; but said Ukrainian forces are working to stabilize the front line. &quot;I talked to the soldiers in the morning; they do not confirm our complete withdrawal from Sudzha... I have no information that our troops have completely left Sudzha as of two hours ago,&quot; Kostenko said at a press briefing. Sudzha is located less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Ukrainian border and 85 kilometers (53 miles) from the regional capital, Kursk. Russia launched a renewed offensive in Kursk Oblast last week and reportedly made rapid advances. The developments coincided with the U.S. instituting a temporary pause on all military and intelligence support for Ukraine. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said on March 10 that there is no immediate threat of encirclement as Ukrainian forces are repositioning to &quot;favorable defense lines.&quot; Ukraine launched the cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, initially seizing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. Since then, Russian forces, reinforced by North Korean troops, have steadily pushed back against Ukrainian forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-forces-continue-operations-in-kursk-under-heavy-russian-pressure-zelensky-says/	2025-03-12T06:54:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/fd0d9d5c4438dcaa95c1a8bd467e8c30_1686065778.jpeg
Ukraine doesn't trust Russia but wants to show US its readiness for peace, Zelensky says on ceasefire deal	Ukraine wanted to demonstrate to U.S. President Donald Trump and its European partners that it is serious about ending the war, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 12 about why Kyiv agreed to Washington&apos;s temporary truce proposal. While Ukraine initially proposed a partial ceasefire that would extend only to aerial and naval operations, U.S. delegates proposed a full truce during talks with Ukrainian officials in Jeddah on March 11. After receiving the proposal, Zelensky said Ukraine was &quot;ready for a 30-day ceasefire format offered by the U.S. side.&quot; &quot;I have repeatedly stressed that none of us trust Russia... but we will not play with narratives that we want the war to continue,&quot; Zelensky said at a press conference. &quot;I am very serious, and it is important for me to end the war. I want the U.S. president to see this; so that Europe and everybody unites to push Russia toward ending the war.&quot; After a heated exchange between Trump and Zelensky in the White House on Feb. 28, the Trump administration accused Ukraine of not being ready for peace and froze military and intelligence assistance. The pause was lifted after Kyiv agreed to the ceasefire deal. The Ukrainian president also noted that the ceasefire would be only the first step toward a full peace. After the war ends, martial law will be lifted, and elections will be held, he added. The Trump administration has been pressuring Ukraine to hold elections even before a full peace agreement, even though the Ukrainian Constitution prohibits this under martial law. According to Zelensky, support from Kyiv&apos;s international partners will be required for &quot;technical monitoring&quot; of a full ceasefire. He also raised the question of whether Moscow is open to the agreement. The Kremlin has not voiced an official position on the proposal until it can discuss it with Washington. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said discussions with Russia would be held on March 12. Reuters reported earlier the same day that, according to undisclosed Russian officials, Russia is unlikely to agree to the proposal unless it takes into account Moscow&apos;s battlefield advances and other demands.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-doesnt-trust-russia-but-wants-to-show-trump-readiness-for-peace-zelensky-says-on-ceasefire-deal/	2025-03-12T06:34:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204065456--1-.jpg
Ukraine-US talks in Jeddah concerned potential territorial concessions, Rubio confirms	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed on March 12 that Ukraine-U.S. talks in Saudi Arabia on March 11 included discussions about potential &quot;territorial concessions&quot; as part of a negotiated settlement with Russia. &quot;Yeah, we&apos;ve had conversations,&quot; Rubio said in an airport in Ireland when asked about potential discussions regarding Ukraine ceding territory. The Trump administration has repeatedly said that both Kyiv and Moscow will have to make compromises for a peace deal, calling Ukraine&apos;s goal of restoring its pre-2014 borders &quot;unrealistic.&quot; Russian forces currently occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine, from where reports of systematic repression, torture, and forced deportations emerge. Rubio also said that the Jeddah talks covered &quot;what a negotiation process would look like&quot; and reiterated, &quot;There is no military solution to this conflict.&quot; The official acknowledged that Ukraine requires security assurances to deter possible future Russian aggression and emphasized that &quot;Europeans will need to be involved in this regard.&quot; Trump has so far refused to offer such security guarantees, saying during his Feb. 28 meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky that responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security should fall on Europe. Kyiv agreed to a temporary 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia abides by it. Moscow has not officially declared its position on the proposal. U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 11 that Washington would engage Russian President Vladimir Putin this week to discuss the ceasefire terms. Rubio claimed the U.S. &#x201C;will have contact with Russians&#x201D; on March 12. The agreement led to the U.S. resuming military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, which had been suspended after Zelensky&apos;s Oval Office clash with Trump. The ceasefire proposal marks a significant shift for Kyiv, as Ukrainian officials have previously warned that a temporary pause in fighting would allow Russia to regroup and relaunch its offensive.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-us-talks-in-saudi-arabia-discussed-potential-territorial-concessions-rubio-confirms/	2025-03-12T06:01:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194087620.jpg
200,000-500,000 men could leave Ukraine after war ends and borders open, minister says	Between 200,000 and 500,000 men could leave Ukraine after the war with Russia ends and all travel restrictions are lifted, Deputy Prime Minister and National Unity Minister Oleksii Chernyshov said on March 12. Draft-age men are not permitted to leave Ukraine under martial law, which was instituted at the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, without a special permission. Speaking at a press briefing attended by the Kyiv Independent, Chernyshov stressed the demographic challenges facing Ukraine in the fourth year of the full-scale war. A January report by the National Bank of Ukraine estimated the net outflow of migrants from Ukraine at 200,000 this year and up to 500,000 in 2027. Some 32 million people live in Ukraine-controlled territories, Chernyshov said. Roughly 5 million Ukrainian refugees remain abroad under the temporary protection of host countries, while millions more live in Russian-occupied parts of the country. The minister estimated that only roughly 30% of the Ukrainians living abroad may return within the year after the war&apos;s potential end. Another 30% may not return at all, he added. Discussions about peace are gaining ground as the U.S. and Ukraine recently agreed on a temporary ceasefire, which they presented as a step toward a broader peace agreement with Russia. Demographic trends do not work in Ukraine&apos;s favor either. For every 150,000 Ukrainian children born in a year, 450,000 die in the same period, a figure excluding war-related deaths, according to the minister. This complicates an already dire situation in Ukraine&apos;s labor market. Ukraine currently lacks more than 4.5 million workers, Chernyshov said.	https://kyivindependent.com/200-000-500-000-men-could-leave-ukraine-after-war-ends-borders-open-minister-says/	2025-03-12T05:54:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1820446236.jpg
Northern Operational Command chief dismissed for unclear reasons	Major General Dmytro Krasylnykov, commander of Ukraine&apos;s Northern Operational Command, has been dismissed from his post, he told Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne on March 12. Krasylnykov said he was not given an official reason for his dismissal. The order, signed on March 7, places him in a reserve battalion. &quot;I&apos;m guessing, but I don&apos;t want to talk about it yet,&quot; Krasylnykov told Suspilne when asked about the possible reasons for his removal. The dismissal follows reports of intensified Russian advances against Ukrainian positions in Kursk Oblast, where Kyiv launched a cross-border incursion in August 2024. The Northern Operational Command oversees units deployed in Ukraine&apos;s northern regions, including Sumy Oblast, the launching ground for the Kursk incursion. Speaking to the outlet, Krasylnykov said he does not see any possible reasons for his dismissal, including in relation to the developments in Kursk Oblast. &quot;Roughly speaking, I left Kursk Oblast back in November (2024),&quot; he said. Russian forces reportedly have entered the town of Sudzha as of March 12, according to DeepState, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), and Russian state news agency TASS. Krasylnykov had commanded the Northern Operational and Tactical Group since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. In March 2023, he was appointed commander of the Northern Operational Command. On Feb. 28, 2022, Krasylnykov was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine and the Order of the Golden Star for his role in defending Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty. Concerns about the situation in Kursk Oblast have grown amid Ukraine&apos;s temporary loss of U.S. military and intelligence support after the Feb. 28 clash between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump. The support was resumed on March 11 after Ukraine agreed to a U.S.-proposed temporary ceasefire.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-north-operational-command-chief-dismissed/	2025-03-12T04:53:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/468597721_967844978707860_4260084381588029574_n.jpg
Raiffeisen Bank International's subsidiary remains invested in sanctioned Russian entities, report says	Raiffeisen Bank International&apos;s (RBI) Russian assets manager continues to hold and promote investments in sanctioned Russian companies and government bonds, according to a joint investigation by the BankTrack NGO and the B4Ukraine coalition published on March 12. As of January, Raiffeisen Capital held around 31.7 billion rubles ($365 million) in shares and bonds in entities sanctioned by the U.S. and the EU for their role in supporting Russian aggression in Ukraine, the report said, citing financial documents. This sum is only part of the overall value of 70.9 billion ($818 million) rubles reportedly held across 10 funds. Austria&apos;s Raiffeisen banking group has been long scrutinized for failing to exit the Russian market despite the EU sanctions imposed at the outbreak of the full-scale war against Ukraine in 2022. The investigation highlights that these assets included roughly 2.7 billion rubles ($31 million) in state bonds issued after March 9, 2022, a cut-off date past which the EU banned trade in any transferable securities issued by the Russian government. The asset manager&apos;s other investments reportedly include about 1.6 billion rubles ($18.5 million) worth of shares in the Russian state-owned bank Sberbank and 2.2 billion rubles ($25.4 million) in the state energy giant Gazprom, both under Western sanctions. Raiffeisen remains the largest Western bank still operating in Russia, despite pleding in July 2024 that it would &quot;drastically&quot; scale down its business in the country. &quot;We must call these investments what they are: war profiteering with reckless disregard for the Ukrainian people and for European efforts to sanction the Russian war machine,&quot; said Max Hammer, a human rights campaigner at BankTrack. &quot;RBI must address and be made to answer for these violations, and it must provide detailed information on its financial links to the Russian war machine. If it fails to do so, European authorities should not hesitate to respond appropriately.&quot; The authors of the report argue that Raiffeisen Capital&apos;s investment activities may contravene European sanctions legislation. &quot;RBI has previously claimed that its Russian business is subject to rigorous due diligence and sanctions compliance checks, but these due diligence procedures have clearly not been enough to prevent the bank from investing in key sponsors of Russia&#x2019;s war of aggression,&quot; Nezir Sinani, the executive director at B4Ukraine, said in a statement. &quot;The time for RBI to decisively sever its relationship with Russia&#x2019;s wartime economy is long overdue.&quot; Raiffeisen Capital has not responded to the Kyiv Independent&apos;s request for comment at the time of publication.	https://kyivindependent.com/raiffeisen-bank-internationals-subsidiary-remains-invested-in-sanctioned-russian-entities-report-says/	2025-03-12T04:30:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1250736178.jpg
Russian, US intelligence chiefs call to discuss 'reducing confrontation,' Russian media reports	Sergey Naryshkin, director of Russia&apos;s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and CIA Director John Ratcliffe held a telephone conversation on March 11 to discuss reducing confrontation between Moscow and Washington, pro-Kremlin media outlet Kommersant reported. According to Kommersant, the agencies agreed to maintain communication &quot;to help ensure international stability and security, as well as to reduce confrontation.&quot; &quot;The two intelligence services discussed issues of interaction in the areas of common interest and crisis management,&quot; the service said, as quoted by Kommersant. Naryshkin last spoke with the CIA chief, a position held at the time by Bill Burns, in the summer of 2023. The renewed dialogue follows U.S.-Russia talks in Istanbul on Feb. 27 and an earlier round in Riyadh on Feb. 18, part of U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s push for a swift peace deal between Ukraine and Russia. Russia&apos;s Foreign Ministry previously said that it hopes such discussions will &quot;strengthen trust&quot; between Moscow and Washington. The direct engagement between the U.S. and Russia has raised concerns in Kyiv and Europe that Washington is sidelining its allies. Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, has emphasized the administration&apos;s intent to reset relations with Russia, blaming previous U.S. leadership for avoiding direct engagement with Russian President Vladimir Putin.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-us-intelligence-chiefs-reportedly-discuss-reducing-confrontation/	2025-03-12T04:09:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-172750694--1-.jpeg
EU retaliates against new US steel, aluminum tariffs	The European Union announced measures in response to new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, planning duties on over $28 billion worth of U.S. goods, according to an official statement published on March 12. The move follows U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s decision to impose 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, reigniting trade tensions between Washington and Brussels. In response, the European Commission is launching countermeasures to protect businesses, workers, and consumers from what it called &quot;unjustified U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs.&quot; The EU&apos;s countermeasures could affect up to 26 billion euros ($28.3 billion) worth of U.S. goods exports, equivalent to the economic impact of the U.S. tariffs. The retaliatory steps will be introduced in two phases. Previously suspended countermeasures, first imposed during the first Trump term in 2018 and 2020, will lapse on April 1, responding to U.S. tariffs costing 8 billion euros ($8.7 billion) in EU exports. The second phase will introduce new countermeasures on April 13 in response to U.S. tariffs costing the EU 18 billion euros ($19.7 billion) in exports. &quot;We deeply regret this measure. Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business and even worse for consumers. These tariffs are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy,&quot; said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The commission signaled its willingness to negotiate a resolution, saying that the measures could be lifted if an agreement is reached. Trump defended the tariffs as a means to simplify duties on metals and suggested retaliatory measures against countries imposing tariffs on U.S. goods. The dispute dates back to Trump&apos;s first term, when his administration imposed duties on nearly $7 billion of European exports in 2018, citing national security concerns. The EU retaliated with its own tariffs on American products. A temporary truce was reached in 2021 under the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden, with the U.S. replacing the tariffs with a quota system and the EU freezing its countermeasures. Trump&apos;s new tariffs threaten to reignite the trade conflict, with the European Commission warning that such restrictions could disrupt supply chains and raise costs for businesses and consumers. The U.S.&apos;s tariffs threat Ukraine&apos;s industry as well. Steel production is a key sector of Ukraine&apos;s economy, the second-largest source of foreign currency after agriculture.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-announces-response-to-new-us-steel-aluminum-tariffs/	2025-03-12T03:22:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-688109050.jpg
Putin unlikely to accept 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, Reuters reports	Russia is unlikely to agree to a temporary truce in Ukraine proposed by the U.S., feeling it has the upper hand on the battlefield and viewing the ceasefire as a trap, Reuters reported on March 12, citing undisclosed Russian sources. Any ceasefire agreement would have to take Russia&apos;s battlefield advances into account and provide &quot;guarantees&quot; to Moscow, sources told the news agency. Ukraine agreed to the U.S.&apos;s proposal for a 30-day truce during talks in Jeddah on March 11, after which Washington resumed military and intelligence support for Kyiv. The U.S. is expected to discuss the proposal with Russia in the coming days. The Kremlin is yet to comment on the idea, but Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top officials have previously ruled out a temporary ceasefire that would freeze the conflict along the current front lines. Russia continues to occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory and made steady advances in Donetsk Oblast in late 2024. While Russia&apos;s advance in Ukraine&apos;s east has reportedly stalled earlier this year, Moscow&apos;s troops seemed to have made rapid gains in Kursk Oblast, the Russian border region where Ukraine has been fighting since August 2024. One source told Reuters that a ceasefire could weaken Russia&apos;s position, as the West could pin the blame on Moscow should it fail to end the war. Russian nationalist voices and pro-war bloggers have already denounced the ceasefire proposal. Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the international committee in the Russian Senate, said that any deal should be hashed out on Moscow&apos;s terms.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-unlikely-to-accept-30-day-ceasefire-in-ukraine-reuters-reports/	2025-03-12T02:55:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2161636677.jpg
Russia reportedly enters Ukraine-held Sudzha in Kursk Oblast; Kyiv hasn't confirmed	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russian troops have launched an offensive on the Ukrainian-controlled town of Sudzha in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the DeepState monitoring group, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), and the Russian state news agency TASS claimed on March 12. According to DeepState, Russian forces have entered the eastern part of Sudzha and are entrenching their positions. Russian state media outlet TASS published purported drone footage of the town, claiming Russian troops had entered the town center. ISW analysts reported that Russian troops continue to advance within Sudzha itself, as well as north of the town near the settlements of Kazachya Loknya, Yuzhny, Kubatkino, and Ivashkovskyi, and along the border in Ukraine&apos;s Sumy Oblast. The claims could not be immediately verified. The Kyiv Independent has contacted the Ukrainian military command in Kursk Oblast for comment and has been promised an official statement later. Sudzha is located less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Ukrainian border, with the regional capital, Kursk, lying 85 kilometers (53 miles) to the northeast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-reportedly-launches-assault-on-ukrainian-controlled-sudzha-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-03-12T02:21:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166820734.jpg
US resumes sharing intelligence with Ukraine, Gabbard confirms	Tulsi Gabbard, the U.S. director of national intelligence, confirmed on March 12 that the U.S. had resumed sharing intelligence with Ukraine per President Donald Trump&apos;s direction. The move follows U.S.-Ukraine talks in Jeddah on March 11, during which both sides preliminarily agreed on a 30-day ceasefire, and Washington resumed military and intelligence assistance to Kyiv. &quot;Because of @POTUS leadership, we are one significant step closer to ending the bloody war in Ukraine,&quot; Gabbard said on X. &quot;Per the President&apos;s direction, the pause on intelligence sharing with Ukraine has ended.&quot; The U.S. restricted intelligence sharing with Ukraine on March 5, shortly after pausing all military assistance flowing to the country. The steps followed a heated exchange between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House on Feb. 28. U.S. intelligence has been crucial for Kyiv in planning precision strikes against Russia, monitoring the movement of Russian troops, and detecting Russia&apos;s aerial strikes. The full impact of the intelligence sharing pause remains unclear. During that short period, Russia achieved a significant breakthrough in Kursk Oblast and launched several deadly aerial strikes against Ukraine. Steve Witkoff, Trump&apos;s envoy for the Middle East, claimed that the restrictions did not concern intelligence needed for defensive purposes.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-resumes-sharing-intelligence-with-ukraine-gabbard-confirms/	2025-03-12T02:09:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203492012.jpg
Trump to invite Zelensky back to White House following Saudi talks	U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 11 that President Volodymyr Zelensky is welcome to return to the White House following talks in Saudi Arabia, where Ukraine agreed to a temporary ceasefire. Trump reiterated that Ukraine had accepted a full 30-day ceasefire proposal during negotiations in Jeddah and expressed hope that &quot;Russia will agree to it.&quot; &quot;We&apos;re going to meet with them (Russia) later on today and tomorrow, and hopefully, we&apos;ll be able to (work) out a deal. I think the ceasefire is very important,&quot; Trump said. When asked if Zelensky would be invited back to the White House, the U.S. president responded, &quot;Sure, absolutely.&quot; The development comes after weeks of strained ties between Kyiv and Washington following a heated Oval Office exchange between Trump and Zelensky on Feb. 28. This clash derailed plans to sign a bilateral mineral resources deal and led to the freeze of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing. In the aftermath, White House officials signaled that Zelensky needed to apologize and commit to peace talks to restore discussions. On March 4, Zelensky called the confrontation &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his willingness to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Following negotiations in Saudi Arabia, Ukraine confirmed its readiness to implement a temporary 30-day ceasefire, contingent on Russia&apos;s adherence to the agreement. The decision marks a significant shift, as Ukrainian officials had previously warned that any pause in fighting would allow Russia to regroup and prepare for future offensives. Talks in Jeddah also resulted in Washington restoring military and intelligence support to Ukraine, reversing Trump&apos;s earlier decision to suspend assistance after the Feb. 28 dispute.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-invites-zelensky-back-to-white-house-following-saudi-talks/	2025-03-12T01:52:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201820195.jpg
Slovakia’s protests prove the fight for Europe isn’t over	On March 7, tens of thousands of people took to the streets across Slovakia for the third time this year to protest the pro-Russian policies of Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico&#x2019;s government. They voiced concerns that Slovakia is drifting away from the European Union and its transatlantic allies. Their fears are well-founded. Since autumn 2023, a coalition of nationalist, EU-skeptic, and pro-Russian parties has held power in Bratislava. While Fico&#x2019;s left-wing Smer party pushes pro-Russian rhetoric, the Slovak National Party (SNS) promotes a &#x201C;pan-Slavic brotherhood&#x201D; with Moscow. The result is the same: under Fico, Slovakia is moving in a direction similar to Viktor Orb&#xE1;n&#x2019;s Hungary. Fico&#x2019;s government has demonstrated a clear alignment with Moscow. In September 2024, he falsely claimed that Nazi troops were fighting in Ukraine. He was also the first prime minister of an EU member state to grant an interview to the Russian state television channel Rossiya 1. In October 2024, &#x13D;ubo&#x161; Blaha, a European Parliament member of Fico&#x2019;s Smer, traveled to Moscow to &#x201C;apologize to the Russians for EU sanctions,&#x201D; provocatively stating, &#x201C;fascism and war come from the West, while freedom and peace come from the East.&#x201D; Fico met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow in December 2024, and he had already accepted Putin&#x2019;s invitation to travel to Moscow in May 2025. In January 2025, a delegation from SNS also visited Moscow, where party chairman Andrej Danko called Putin &#x201C;a very reasonable and pragmatic leader.&#x201D; Concerned about the government&#x2019;s pro-Russian stance, the liberal opposition party Freedom and Solidarity (SaS) proposed enshrining Slovakia&#x2019;s EU membership in the constitution. The response from Fico&#x2019;s camp was both surprising and alarming: Tibor Ga&#x161;par, a former police chief indicted for criminal activity and now a Smer politician, suggested that Slovakia should consider leaving the EU if its rules were to change. Even President Peter Pellegrini, from the coalition partner Hlas, distanced himself from Ga&#x161;par&#x2019;s remarks. While a Slovak exit from the EU may still seem unlikely, many citizens are deeply unsettled by the government&#x2019;s direction. This frustration has fueled mass protests, where demonstrators wave Ukrainian flags and rally under the slogan &#x201C;Peace for Ukraine.&#x201D; Fico, however, has responded with conspiracy theories. When his government faced a no-confidence vote in January 2025 &#x2014; after losing several MPs and potentially its parliamentary majority &#x2014; he called for a closed session, claiming Slovakia&#x2019;s intelligence service (led by the son of Tibor Ga&#x161;par) had warned him of an attempted coup. According to Fico, NGOs active in Ukraine and Georgia were plotting to overthrow him &#x2014; a claim with no evidence, but one that echoed the rhetoric of Viktor Orb&#xE1;n in Hungary. Around the same time, Orb&#xE1;n himself visited Bratislava, further strengthening ties between the two leaders. In the end, Fico managed to block the no-confidence vote, despite his government&#x2019;s fragile majority. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico in Bratislava, Slovakia, on Oct. 1, 2023. (Vladimir Simicek/AFP via Getty Images)Fico&#x2019;s Orb&#xE1;n-like approach extends beyond foreign policy into domestic affairs. Ironically, Fico &#x2014; who pursued anti-Hungarian minority policies in his first term (2006&#x2013;2010) &#x2014; has now become a close ally of Orb&#xE1;n. Even Slovakia&#x2019;s Hungarian minority party aligns with Fico&#x2019;s anti-Ukrainian, pro-Russian stance. Like Orb&#xE1;n, Fico has worked to weaken democratic checks and balances &#x2014; amending criminal law in his interests, restructuring public media to silence critical journalists, and allowing SNS&#x2019;s nationalist culture minister to wage a political war against artists (theater and museum directors have been dismissed and replaced with loyalists). Despite these troubling developments, Slovakia under Fico remains freer and more pluralistic than Orb&#xE1;n&#x2019;s Hungary. The key difference is stability: Orb&#xE1;n has ruled since 2010 with a strong parliamentary majority, whereas Fico&#x2019;s coalition is fragile and divided. Some MPs from his smaller coalition partners, SNS and Hlas, have already left the government, though they have not yet voted against him. Fico&#x2019;s pro-Russian stance has so far been more of a rhetorical tool for domestic politics. Unlike Orb&#xE1;n, he ultimately did not block the EU&#x2019;s decision on Ukraine in early March, as he hopes the European Union will secure gas supplies for Slovakia. Fico&#x2019;s pragmatism can also be explained by the fact that a fully pro-Russian foreign policy and a boycott strategy at the European level would not even be entirely supported within his own coalition &#x2014; particularly by the Hlas party of President Peter Pellegrini. At the same time, the issue of Ukraine &#x2014; again in contrast to Hungary &#x2014; is a key mobilising force for the Slovak opposition. While the Hungarian opposition avoids open and direct confrontation with Orb&#xE1;n on this matter out of opportunism, tens of thousands of people take to the streets in Slovakia to demonstrate in support of Ukraine and against Fico&#x2019;s pro-Russian policies. Political instability and mounting public resistance continue to pressure Fico. On the streets of Slovak cities, the Ukrainian flag has become a symbol of pro-European commitment for many. They are not &#x201C;foreign agents,&#x201D; as Fico claims, but decent citizens of Slovakia who want to avoid the Orb&#xE1;nization of their country.

Maxar reportedly restores Ukraine's access to high-resolution satellite imagery	U.S. aerospace company Maxar Technologies has restored Ukraine&apos;s access to the Global Enhanced GEOINT Delivery (GEGD) service, allowing Kyiv to utilize high-resolution commercial satellite imagery again, Ukrainian media outlet Militarnyi reported on March 12, citing users of the service. Ukraine has relied on such imagery for defense and strategic planning, including tracking Russian troop movements, assessing battlefield conditions, and monitoring damage to Russian infrastructure. According to Militarnyi&apos;s sources, the program&apos;s resumption means Ukraine can again access critical satellite intelligence for defense operations. The move follows U.S.-Ukraine talks in Jeddah on March 11, where Washington agreed to restart key military and intelligence support for Ukraine. On March 7, Militarnyi reported that Maxar had restricted Ukraine&apos;s access to its satellite imagery, citing unnamed users. The company later confirmed the suspension in a statement to the Kyiv Independent, explaining that the restrictions applied specifically to imagery provided through U.S. government programs. CIA Director John Ratcliffe said on March 5 that the U.S. had halted intelligence sharing with Ukraine in a step seen as pressure tactics to push Kyiv toward peace negotiations with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/maxar-technologies-restores-ukraines-access-to-high-resolution-satellite-imagery/	2025-03-12T01:33:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1232955804.jpg
Georgia's ex-President Saakashvili sentenced to 9 more years in prison on embezzlement charges	Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili has been sentenced to an additional nine years in prison for an alleged large-scale embezzlement of state funds, the Tbilisi City Court ruled, as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&apos;s Georgian service reported on March 12. Judge Badri Kochlamazashvili found Saakashvili guilty of misappropriating 9 million lari (about $5.4 million at the time) from the state budget between May 2009 and February 2013 for personal expenses, including luxury hotels, cosmetic procedures, and designer clothing. Teimuraz Janashia, former head of the Special Guard Service, was also convicted in the case and fined 300,000 Georgian lari ($108,000) for abuse of office. Both men denied the charges, calling the trial politically motivated. Saakashvili, Georgia&apos;s president between 2004-2007 and 2008-2013, sought to take his country on a pro-Western path but lost elections to the Moscow-friendly Georgian Dream party a few years after the defeat in the Russia-Georgia war in 2008. The politician was detained upon returning to Georgia in 2021 and is currently serving six years in prison on charges of ordering the beating of opposition lawmaker Valery Gelashvili in 2005. He was also given a three-year sentence for abuse of power charges for pardoning four police officers convicted of murder in 2008. The former president, a longtime critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has accused oligrach Bidzina Ivanishvili, the honorary chairman of the Georgian Dream party, of orchestrating his prosecution on Moscow&apos;s orders. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled on May 23 that there were no grounds to believe that Saakashvili&apos;s criminal proceedings were unfair. In February 2023, President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Georgian government was &quot;killing&quot; Saakashvili after photos surfaced showing his deteriorating health and significant weight loss. Saakashvili holds Ukrainian citizenship and served as the governor of Odesa Oblast between 2015 and 2016. The ruling follows mass protests in Tbilisi over the disputed October election results, which saw the Kremlin-friendly Georgian Dream party retain power. Since the election, a number of Western countries have imposed sanctions on Georgia over the perceived democratic backsliding. The political crisis deepened after Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced that Georgia&apos;s EU integration could be delayed until 2028.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-ex-president-saakashvili-sentenced-to-nine-more-years-in-prison-for-embezzlement/	2025-03-12T01:15:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1251132287.jpg
Ukraine, US to start discussing ceasefire details next week, Yermak says	Kyiv and Washington have agreed to begin technical-level discussions on a temporary 30-day ceasefire in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine next week, Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak said on March 11 after talks in Saudi Arabia. &quot;Next week, we have already agreed that at the technical expert level, the teams will start talking about all the details,&quot; Yermak told reporters. The deal marks a surprising shift for Ukraine, which has previously warned that a temporary pause in fighting would allow Russia to regroup and launch further offensives. The proposal would require Moscow to abide by the ceasefire terms. Talks in Jeddah also led to Washington restarting key military and intelligence support for Ukraine, reversing a decision made after the Feb. 28 Oval Office confrontation between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to Yermak, the discussions also covered potential security guarantees for Ukraine, though he acknowledged that negotiations on this front are still ongoing. &quot;We understand exactly what we need. Our American partners understand this. They are sympathetic to this issue, but these conversations continue. Today, we have taken the first step, a very important one. And there is still much work to be done,&quot; he said. Trump has previously refused to commit to security guarantees for Ukraine, saying in February that Europe should take responsibility for Kyiv&apos;s security. Moscow has not publicly responded to the U.S.-backed proposal. Russian nationalist voices and pro-war bloggers have already expressed opposition to a ceasefire that would freeze the conflict along the current front lines. Trump said the U.S. would seek to engage Russian President Vladimir Putin in discussions on the plan this week. &quot;It takes two for tango, as I have already said, so I hope he (Putin) will also agree as well, and I really think that would be 75% of the way, the rest is getting it documented,&quot; Trump said on March 11.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-us-teams-to-start-ceasefire-technical-discussions-next-week-yermak-said/	2025-03-12T00:22:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-11_11-38-26.jpg

Russia, China, Iran hold joint naval drills in Gulf of Oman	China, Iran, and Russia conducted joint naval drills on March 11 in the Gulf of Oman, Iran&apos;s state-affiliated Tasnim news agency reported. The exercises, named Maritime Security Belt 2025, were held near the strategic Strait of Hormuz, a key global shipping route through which a fifth of the world&apos;s traded crude oil passes. China, Iran, and Russia have maintained close ties, with Beijing and Tehran supporting Moscow&apos;s war effort despite Western sanctions. The latest drills come as Russia deepens military cooperation with Iran, which has supplied Moscow with thousands of Shahed attack drones used in strikes against Ukraine. China has become Russia&apos;s largest supplier of dual-use goods &#x2014; components that can be used in weapons production. The three countries have carried out similar exercises in past years, including in 2023 and 2024. The latest joint drills highlight ongoing coordination between the three authoritarian regimes as divisions grow in the West over U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s foreign policy shifts, including reduced military commitments in Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-china-iran-hold-joint-naval-drills-in-gulf-of-oman/	2025-03-11T23:39:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1248343324.jpeg
30-day ceasefire 'not a frozen conflict,' Ukraine's FM says	A 30-day ceasefire plan agreed upon between the U.S. and Ukraine &quot;is not a frozen conflict&quot; but the &quot;beginning of the path toward a just peace,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on March 11. Kyiv agreed to the temporary ceasefire proposed by Washington during the talks in Jeddah on March 11, provided that Russia abides by it. The talks in Saudi Arabia also led to the U.S. restarting key military and intelligence support for Ukraine. &quot;Ukraine is not an obstacle to peace; it is a partner in restoring it,&quot; said Sybiha, who was present at the talks. Ukraine&apos;s agreeing to the proposed truce demonstrates &quot;who is really interested in peace,&quot; he added. The deal is a surprising turnaround for Kyiv. Ukrainian officials have often warned about the dangers of a temporary pause in the fighting, arguing that it will provide Russia with a chance to recover strength and launch further attacks. &quot;The U.S. side will now talk to Russia about its willingness or unwillingness to end the war,&quot; Sybiha noted. In the past, Russia has also ruled out a temporary ceasefire that would freeze the conflict along the current front lines. Russian nationalist voices and pro-war bloggers have already spoken out against the U.S.-backed proposal. U.S. President Donald Trump said that Washington would seek to engage Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin this week to discuss the plan. &quot;It takes two for tango, as I have already said, so I hope he (Putin) will also agree as well, and I really think that would be 75% of the way, the rest is getting it documented,&quot; Trump said on March 11. &quot;We will have a big meeting with Russia tomorrow.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-proposed-ceasefire-not-a-frozen-conflict-ukraines-fm-says/	2025-03-11T23:23:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/483793538_1183688763331503_7338987230649715978_n.jpg

Iceland allocates over $2 million to support Ukrainian energy sector	Iceland will allocate over 2 million euros ($2.17 million) to Ukraine&apos;s Energy Support Fund, the Ministry of Energy reported on March 11. This will bring Iceland&#x2019;s total contributions to Ukraine&#x2019;s energy sector to more than 5.6 million euros ($6.09 million) thus far. According to Ukraine&apos;s Energy Ministry, Iceland made four tranches of contributions between 2023 and 2024. The funds have been used to buy equipment for energy companies in Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions. Herman Halushchenko, Ukraine&#x2019;s Energy Minister, stressed the importance of contributions like these for returning light and heat to the homes of Ukrainians, and for restoring infrastructure that was damaged by Russian attacks. &#x201C;Each contribution of partners to the Energy Support Fund of Ukraine is extremely important,&#x201D; Halushchenko said. &#x201C;We are grateful to Iceland for its support and another contribution to Ukraine&apos;s energy sustainability.&#x201D; The Icelandic parliament, Althing, adopted a resolution on long-term assistance for Ukraine from 2024 to 2028. The resolution aims to support the independence, sovereignty, borders, the safety of civilians, humanitarian aid, and reconstruction work in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/iceland-allocates-over-2-million-to-support-ukrainian-energy-sector/	2025-03-11T22:03:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-549681041.jpg
Von der Leyen welcomes US, Ukraine talks and reaffirms EU support	European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the results of Ukraine&#x2019;s talks with the U.S. in Jeddah, on March 11, and reaffirmed the EU&#x2019;s support. She praised the resumption of U.S. military assistance and intelligence sharing, as well as the initiation of a peace agreement proposal. &#x201C;This is a positive development that can be a step towards a comprehensive, just and lasting peace for Ukraine,&#x201D; von der Leyen said on X. She also added that the EU is looking forward to participating in the negotiation process. &#x201C;The EU is ready to play its full part, together with its partners, in the upcoming peace negotiations,&#x201D; she said. Ukrainian and U.S. delegates met in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11, in which the U.S. delegation proposed a 30-day complete ceasefire, pending Russia&#x2019;s agreement. The ceasefire proposal, along with the U.S. resuming military aid and intelligence sharing, were two major developments during the talks. Along with these topics, the delegations also discussed humanitarian efforts in achieving peace, including the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of detained civilians, and the return of forcibly displaced Ukrainian children.	https://kyivindependent.com/von-der-leyen-welcomes-us-ukraine-talks-and-reaffirms-eu-support/	2025-03-11T20:35:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1258844481.jpg
Russian attacks on Donetsk Oblast kill 4, injure 5	Russian troops launched a series of attacks on March 11 against Donetsk Oblast, killing at least four civilians and injuring five, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Two brothers, aged 11 and 13, were among those killed in the attacks. Additionally, two women, aged 51 and 57, died of severe injuries.

Poland ready to receive American aid for Ukraine	Poland is prepared to resume the transport of American aid to Ukraine through its territory, according to Minister of National Defense Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz. His comments followed the recent developments in the U.S.-Ukraine talks, including the March 11 decision to lift the suspension on intelligence sharing and military aid. The U.S. has suspended military aid and intelligence to Ukraine after a meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance in the White House that ended in a heated argument. Kosiniak-Kamysz expressed readiness to activate Poland&#x2019;s Jasionka hub, maintaining full operational capabilities for American support. In a TVN24 interview, Kosiniak-Kamysz acknowledged that, after several days of stalled negotiations, a return to talks was a crucial and positive step. &quot;We have to take this at face value, as an important step in returning to talks,&quot; he said. &quot;We are fully prepared to resume American support,&quot; the minister said. Kosiniak-Kamysz emphasized the importance of this development, adding that Trump could now test whether Russia&#x2019;s previous declarations were genuine or merely an attempt to undermine Western unity and solidarity with Ukraine. He noted that, despite the positive signal from the resumption of talks, it was still crucial to approach the situation cautiously.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-ready-to-receive-american-aid-for-ukraine/	2025-03-11T18:18:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161798255.jpg
Trump will talk to Putin soon as Russia flags possible contact with US in coming days	Russia said on March 11 it may engage in talks with the United States in the coming days, following U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s statement that he might speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week. &quot;We do not rule out contacts with U.S. representatives within the next few days,&quot; Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told state news agencies. After Kyiv signaled its willingness to accept Washington&apos;s proposal for an immediate, temporary 30-day ceasefire, extendable by mutual agreement, Trump emphasized the need to engage with Russia, expressing hope that Putin would also agree and that negotiations could move forward. &quot;For tango, it takes two, as I have already said, so I hope he (Putin) will agree as well, and I really think that would be 75% of the way, the rest is just paperwork,&quot; Trump said. &quot;Ukraine has agreed to it, and hopefully Russia will agree to it. We&apos;re going to meet with them later on, today and tomorrow, and hopefully, we&apos;ll be able to wipe out a deal. But I think the ceasefire is very important. If we can get Russia to do it, that&apos;ll be great. If we can&apos;t, we just keep going on, and people are going to get killed, lots of people,&quot; Trump told reporters at the White House. Cease-fire negotiations gained fresh momentum during talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, after previously stalling following a heated confrontation between the Ukrainian and U.S. presidents at the White House. In the wake of that tense exchange, the Trump administration had halted all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. The joint statement issued on March 11 marked a significant development, coming just hours after Russian officials reported that Ukrainian drones had launched the largest attack on Moscow since the war began. The United States agreed to lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine, Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office announced following the meetings.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-will-talk-to-putin-soon-as-russia-flags-possible-contact-with-us-in-coming-days/	2025-03-11T17:41:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183214747.jpg
US restores Ukraine aid following breakthrough talks, senior Ukrainian official says	The United States has resumed security assistance to Ukraine following high-level talks in Saudi Arabia, Deputy Head of the Presidential Office Pavlo Palisa announced on March 11. &quot;I have confirmation that security assistance from the U.S. has been resumed. The agreements are being implemented. The fight continues!&quot; Palisa wrote on Facebook. The announcement follows a meeting between U.S. and Ukrainian delegations in Jeddah, where the two sides sought to find common ground after weeks of strained relations. As one of the key outcomes of the talks, Kyiv confirmed its readiness to accept Washington&#x2019;s proposal for an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, provided that Russia agrees to the terms and implements them simultaneously. Tensions between Ukraine and the U.S. had escalated following a contentious meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Feb. 28. The heated exchange led to a freeze in military and intelligence support from the U.S., raising concerns in Kyiv about America&#x2019;s commitment to Ukraine&#x2019;s defense. The joint statement issued after the Jeddah meeting reaffirmed Ukraine&#x2019;s conditional support for the U.S.-proposed ceasefire, which could be extended beyond 30 days if all parties agree. &quot;The American side understands our arguments and accepts our proposals, I would like to thank President Trump for the constructive nature of the dialogue between our teams,&quot; Zelensky said following the meeting.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-restores-ukraine-aid-following-breakthrough-talks-senior-ukrainian-official-says/	2025-03-11T16:12:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/DSCF7967.jpg
Macron rallies Europe to back Ukraine following ceasefire talks, Le Monde reports	French President Emmanuel Macron urged European and NATO military leaders on March 11 to develop a concrete plan for &quot;credible security guarantees&quot; for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. Speaking at a closed-door meeting in Paris with military chiefs from more than 30 allied nations, Macron emphasized that Europe must &quot;throw its full weight behind Ukraine, and itself,&quot; according to Le Monde. His appeal followed Ukraine&#x2019;s endorsement of a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire and agreement to negotiations with Russia in Jeddah. The meeting included representatives from 34 countries, including Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, but no U.S. officials were present. Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer have taken the lead in forming a &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; to enforce an eventual ceasefire in Ukraine. The French presidency reported that military leaders from European and NATO countries, including the U.K. and Turkey, agreed that security guarantees for Ukraine &quot;should not be separated from NATO and its capabilities.&quot; These guarantees must be &quot;credible and long-term&quot; and should be paired with &quot;unfailing support for the Ukrainian army.&quot; French Defense Minister S&#xE9;bastien Lecornu underscored the importance of planning for Ukraine&apos;s future military needs, adding that: &quot;We will reject any form of demilitarisation of Ukraine.&quot; Concerns over Washington&apos;s shifting stance on Russia and Ukraine have fueled Europe&apos;s push to strengthen its own defenses. Trump&#x2019;s earlier decision to suspend military aid and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, along with his renewed negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, has raised fears that the U.S. may pressure Ukraine into a settlement favoring Russia. European leaders are scrambling to ensure that Ukraine&#x2019;s security does not become a bargaining chip in U.S.-Russia talks. &quot;It is simply a question of looking ahead and thinking about what the Ukrainian army should be in the future,&quot; Lecornu said. Following the military chiefs&#x2019; meeting, defense ministers from Europe&#x2019;s five largest military powers&#x2014;France, the U.K., Germany, Italy, and Poland&#x2014;are set to gather in Paris on March 12. EU and NATO representatives, as well as Ukraine&#x2019;s defense minister, will also take part in discussions focused on &quot;the necessary rearmament of Europe&quot; and continued military support for Kyiv. Macron has also scheduled talks with defense manufacturers later this week to push for increased weapons production, aligning with his call for France to switch to &quot;war economy mode.&quot; Starmer, meanwhile, will host virtual talks on March 15 with leaders of nations willing to back Ukraine&#x2019;s defense. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen recently announced a plan to mobilize approximately 800 billion euro ($843 billion) to strengthen European defense and provide &quot;immediate&quot; military support for Ukraine. France has also pledged to raise its defense spending to around &#x20AC;100 billion annually, doubling the planned 50.5 billion euro for 2025. Turkey, which has NATO&#x2019;s second-largest army, is positioning itself as a key player in regional security. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has backed Ukraine&#x2019;s calls for an aerial and naval truce, signaling his country&#x2019;s readiness to play a leading role in Europe&apos;s evolving security strategy.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-rallies-europe-to-back-ukraine-following-ceasefire-talks/	2025-03-11T15:38:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1977990485.jpg

Graham, hope Putin agrees to ceasefire	U.S. President Donald Trump hailed Ukraine&apos;s agreement to a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire on March 11 as a significant step forward to a &quot;total ceasefire.&quot; Speaking to reporters at the White House following the announcements from Jeddah, Trump said the focus now shifts to Russia, urging President Vladimir Putin to accept the truce. &quot;Now we have to go to Russia and hopefully President Putin will agree to that also. And we can get this show on the road,&quot; he said. Trump added that if Russia refuses, the war will continue, leading to further loss of life. Trump confirmed that U.S. officials would meet with Russian representatives in the coming days to discuss the ceasefire. He also indicated he expects to speak with Putin later this week, emphasizing, &quot;It takes two to tango.&quot; Senator Lindsey Graham also praised Ukraine&apos;s decision to back the ceasefire, applauding the Trump administration&#x2019;s role in brokering the agreement.

If Russia refuses, we should sanction the hell out of them.&quot; Graham vowed to introduce new congressional sanctions targeting Russia and nations that continue to buy Russian goods, including oil, gas, and uranium. &quot;It is long overdue for Russia to feel overwhelming economic pain as a result of their brutal invasion of Ukraine,&quot; he said. Trump also told reported that Zelensky is welcome back to the White House after their tense meeting in the Oval Office last month. The Feb. 28 meeting had ended in controversy after Trump and Vice President JD Vance criticized Zelensky, accusing him of being disrespectful when he questioned whether Putin could be trusted in negotiations. The disagreement led to a heated exchange, and Zelensky left the White House abruptly, canceling a planned joint press conference with Trump and leaving a critical minerals agreement unsigned. Trump has since expressed mixed views on Ukraine&#x2019;s priorities, ruling out its NATO membership and falsely suggesting that Ukraine started the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/if-russia-refuses-we-should-sanction-the-hell-out-of-them-trump-sen-graham-hope-putin-agrees-to-ceasefire/	2025-03-11T14:31:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2147873245.jpg
Ball is in their court' — Rubio on Russia's move toward ceasefire with Ukraine	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio voiced hope on March 11 that Russia would accept the proposal for a temporary ceasefire with Ukraine. &quot;The ball is in their court,&quot; Rubio said during a press conference following the talks with Ukraine in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. After the negotiations with Washington, Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office announced that it was ready to accept the U.S. proposal for a temporary 30-day ceasefire if Russia also complied with the agreement. Rubio noted that if the Kremlin rejects the ceasefire proposal, &quot;then we&apos;ll, unfortunately, know what the impediment is to peace here.&quot; &quot;Ukraine is ready to stop shooting and start talking,&quot; Rubio said, adding that U.S. President Donald Trump has been clear that he wants to stop the war swiftly. Asked about the deadline for the &#x441;onclusion of a truce agreement, Rubio said Washington hopes to do it &quot;as soon as possible.&quot; During the talks, the Ukrainian delegation proposed to implement a partial truce in the sky and at sea, while the U.S. side wanted &quot;to try to do more,&quot; a source close to the Presidential Office told the Kyiv Independent. Russia&apos;s stance toward a partial ceasefire is unclear, the source added. Moscow has repeatedly rejected freezing hostilities along the current front line, believing it has the upper hand on the battlefield. &quot;Within a certain period of time, we will prepare a final agreement on how to end the war. Now, the discussions concern only the first steps,&quot; the source said. Ways to enforce a possible ceasefire also remain uncertain. Kyiv has previously emphasized that firm security guarantees from the U.S. and other partners should be a key part of any cessation of hostilities, arguing that Russia has repeatedly violated multiple ceasefires since the start of its aggression in 2014.	https://kyivindependent.com/ball-is-in-their-court-rubio-on-russias-move-toward-ceasefire-with-ukraine/	2025-03-11T13:26:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193483462.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine is ready for temporary ceasefire if Russia sticks to it; US to restore security, intelligence assistance to Ukraine	Key developments on March 11: Kyiv is ready to accept Washington&apos;s proposal to immediately implement a temporary, 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement, the Presidential Office announced on March 11 after the talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia. Ukraine is ready to take such a step only if Russia adheres to the terms of the ceasefire in the same way. &quot;Ukrainian proposal for this meeting with the Americans was three things: ceasefire in the sky &#x2014; missiles, bombs, long-range drones &#x2014; and ceasefire at sea, as well as measures to establish trust to this process, first of all &#x2013; the release of prisoners,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said following the meeting. &quot;The American side understands our arguments, accepts our proposals, I want to thank President (Donald) Trump for the constructiveness of our teams&apos; conversation,&quot; he added. And today, there was a proposal from the American side to take the first step right away and attempt to establish a complete ceasefire for 30 days, not only regarding missiles, drones, and bombs, not only in the Black Sea but also along the entire front line,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Ukraine accepts this proposal.&quot; Zelensky added that the U.S. &quot;must convince Russia&quot; to abide by it. The president added that as part of the deal, the U.S. agreed to resume intelligence sharing with Ukraine.

The freeze on military aid has drawn criticism even from members of Trump&apos;s own party. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said that pulling aid from Ukraine in the midst of Russia&apos;s war would &quot;be worse than Afghanistan.&quot; U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz confirmed during a joint press conference in Jeddah that Washington will continue to provide military assistance to Ukraine under the so-called Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) program. The delegations also discussed the essential role of humanitarian efforts in achieving peace, including the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of detained civilians and the return of forcibly displaced Ukrainian children.The delegates will determine the composition of their negotiating teams to begin further negotiations to achieve a sustainable peace that will ensure Ukraine&apos;s long-term security, the Presidential Office&apos;s statement read. Ukrainian forces successfully attacked the Moscow Oil Refinery and a Druzhba oil pipeline facility in Oryol Oblast overnight on March 11, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. The statement comes after Russia claimed to have downed over 330 Ukrainian drones in the Moscow, Oryol, and eight other oblasts in a massive drone strike. The attack was carried out by Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces in cooperation with the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and military intelligence (HUR), the General Staff said. The operation &quot;struck a number of Russian strategic objects, enabling armed aggression against Ukraine,&quot; the military said. Ukraine has repeatedly targeted industrial and military facilities in Russia&apos;s rear to undermine Moscow&apos;s ability to wage its war. Multiple hits were recorded at the Moscow Oil Refinery, which is capable of processing 11 million metric tons of oil per year and covers 40-50% of Moscow&apos;s gasoline and diesel supplies, according to the statement. Explosions were also reported at the Stalnoy Kon fuel facility in Oryol Oblast. This facility is a key part of the Druzhba oil pipeline infrastructure and ensures oil supplies to the Ust-Luga port in Leningrad Oblast. The facility lies around 170 kilometers (100 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its forces had intercepted a massive strike of 337 Ukrainian drones across multiple regions, including 91 over Moscow Oblast, 126 over Kursk Oblast, 38 over Bryansk Oblast, eight over Oryol Oblast, and others over the Belgorod, Ryazan, Kaluga, Lipetsk, Voronezh, and Nizhny Novgorod regions. This would mark Ukraine&apos;s most extensive drone strike against Moscow and Russia throughout the full-scale war. Russian officials did not report hits against any strategic targets but claimed that civilian sites were damaged across Moscow Oblast. Three people were allegedly killed by drone debris, while 18 were wounded, Moscow claims. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The Ukrainian military said it has &quot;detailed information about the strategic facilities&quot; enabling Russian aggression and &quot;adheres to the norms of international humanitarian law and takes measures to protect the civilian population as much as possible.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin remains unwilling to compromise in peace talks, complicating U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s efforts to secure a settlement, Bloomberg reported on March 10, citing undisclosed Western security officials. Putin has deliberately set &quot;maximalist&quot; demands on territory, peacekeepers, and Ukraine&apos;s neutrality, knowing they will likely be unacceptable to Kyiv and European nations, the outlet wrote. In June 2024, Putin insisted Ukraine must withdraw from the four partially occupied regions &#x2014; Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia &#x2014; as a precondition for negotiations. Despite Trump&apos;s claim on Feb. 24 that Putin would allow European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a deal, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has rejected the idea. Putin, according to Western officials, is prepared to continue the war if his conditions are not met, raising doubts about his seriousness regarding a settlement. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed the claims in a comment for Bloomberg, insisting that Russia remains open to diplomatic negotiations. &quot;Russia is open for peace efforts and prefers to reach our goals through peaceful and diplomatic means,&quot; he told Bloomberg. Russian forces have recaptured 12 settlements and 100 square kilometers (40 square miles) in Kursk Oblast previously held by Ukrainian troops, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed on March 11. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified. The statement comes after Moscow launched a new offensive in the Russian border region, reportedly achieving a breakthrough south of the key town of Sudzha in an effort to encircle the Ukrainian salient. Russia recaptured the settlements of Agronom, Bogdanovka, Bondarevka, Dmitryukov, Zazulevka, Ivashkovsky, Kolmakov, Kubatkin, Martynovka, Mikhailovka, Pravda, and Yuzhny in recent military operations, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed. The DeepState monitoring group confirmed significant territorial losses on Ukraine&apos;s part in Kursk Oblast since Russia launched its offensive last week. The extent of the Ukrainian salient in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast as of March 10, 2025, according to the DeepState monitoring group. (DeepState/OpenStreet Maps)Russian troops and their North Korean allies have also reportedly begun launching attacks in the Sudzha area. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, claimed that there is currently no threat of encirclement as Ukrainian troops are moving to &quot;favorable defense lines.&quot; Syrskyi added that some of the settlements Russia claims to have retaken &quot;no longer exist&quot; as they have been destroyed by Russian fire. Ukraine&apos;s commander-in-chief added that he had decided to reinforce Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast with &quot;the necessary forces and means,&quot; including electronic warfare and drones. Concerns about the Ukrainian operation in Kursk Oblast, ongoing since August 2024, have mounted over the weekend amid reports of Russian advances. The development came shortly after the U.S. cut off military and intelligence support for Ukraine, allegedly to push Kyiv to the negotiating table.

US to 'immediately' resume security assistance, intelligence sharing to Ukraine	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. The United States will immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine, Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office announced on March 11. The statement follows the talks between Ukraine and the U.S. in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-immediately-resume-security-assistance-intelligence-sharing-to-ukraine/	2025-03-11T11:29:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204495001.jpg
Ukraine agrees to 30-day ceasefire if Russia abides by it, Kyiv says	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story. Kyiv is ready to accept Washington&apos;s proposal to immediately implement a temporary, 30-day ceasefire which can be extended by mutual agreement, the Presidential Office announced on March 11 after the talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia. Ukraine is ready to take such a step only if Russia adheres to the terms of the ceasefire in the same way. &quot;Ukrainian proposal for this meeting with the Americans was three things: ceasefire in the sky &#x2014; missiles, bombs, long-range drones &#x2014; and ceasefire at sea, as well as measures to establish trust to this process, first of all &#x2013; the release of prisoners,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said following the meeting. &quot;The American side understands our arguments, accepts our proposals, I want to thank President (Donald) Trump for the constructiveness of our teams&#x2019; conversation,&quot; he added. &quot;And today, there was a proposal from the American side to take the first step right away and attempt to establish a complete ceasefire for 30 days, not only regarding missiles, drones and bombs, not only in the Black Sea, but also along the entire front line,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Ukraine accepts this proposal.&quot; Zelensky added that the U.S. &quot;must convince Russia&quot; to abide by it. The president added that as part of this proposal, the U.S. agreed to resume intel sharing with Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-agrees-to-30-day-ceasefire-if-russia-abides-by-it-kyiv-says/	2025-03-11T11:20:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203962358.jpg
US, Ukraine to present joint statement summarizing talks in Saudi Arabia, FT reports	The U.S. and Ukraine will present a joint statement on the talks between the states in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Financial Times (FT) reported on March 11. The news comes as the Ukraine-U.S. negotiations on a potential ceasefire in the war with Russia, as well as restoring U.S. military aid and intelligence, continue. The participants also discussed the minerals deal that collapsed on Feb. 28 after a heated argument between President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance. The talks are not scheduled to continue for a second day, FT reported. Ukraine was expected to propose a ceasefire at sea and in the sky and a ban on long-range strikes during the talks with the U.S., according to Suspilne. The official told the media outlet that such a ceasefire would be &quot;easy to install and to monitor.&quot; The Ukrainian delegation includes Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa. The U.S. delegation is led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-ukraine-to-present-joint-statement-summarizing-talks-in-saudi-arabia-ft-reports/	2025-03-11T11:14:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204495001.jpg
Over 50% of Ukrainians think West holds back military aid in fear of Russia losing war	According to a poll conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) at the request of the Kyiv Independent, 51.2% of Ukrainians believe that Western countries fear that Russia will lose the all-out war against Ukraine and hold off military aid to Kyiv as a result. The survey, commissioned by the Kyiv Independent, was conducted between Feb. 5 and March 10. Two thousand twenty-nine people took part, and the margin of error stands at 2.1%. According to the poll, 17% of respondents completely agreed with this statement, while 34.2% said they would rather agree. Another 21.3% said they would rather disagreed with the statement. The number of those who strongly disagreed stands at 17.7%, the survey showed. The poll was conducted when U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration took a number of steps widely seen as friendly toward Russia. The U.S. froze intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine soon after a heated argument broke out between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House on Feb. 28. U.S. officials have suggested the pause is &quot;temporary,&quot; without indicating when aid will resume. Given Trump&apos;s rhetoric and policy shift, European officials are considering stepping up support for Kyiv. In 2024, when Russia maintained an initiative on the battlefield, taking advantage of delays in defense aid to Ukraine from Western allies, primarily the U.S., Zelensky said that Western countries &quot;are afraid of Russia losing the war&quot; and would like Kyiv &quot;to win in such a way that Russia does not lose.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/over-50-of-ukrainians-think-west-fears-russias-loss-in-war-and-hold-back-military-aid-poll-shows/	2025-03-11T10:38:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1250459616.jpg
Didn't want to endanger his life' — JD Vance on criticism from his cousin who fought in Ukraine	U.S. Vice President JD Vance did not talk publicly about his cousin Nate&apos;s service in Ukraine because he &quot;didn&apos;t want to endanger his life more than it already was,&quot; he told Fox News on March 11. Nate Vance, a former U.S. Marine, defended Ukraine from 2022 to January 2025 as a member of the Da Vinci Wolves First Motorized Battalion, a volunteer unit. Nate Vance harshly criticized U.S. policy regarding Ukraine and condemned the behavior of his cousin and U.S. President Donald Trump during a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28, after which U.S. leaders berated the Ukrainian president for not being &quot;ready for peace&quot; and supposed lack of gratitude. &quot;As far as his criticisms, I have no interest in arguing with him in public, but I do feel the need to address one issue in particular: his failed effort to contact me. I am unsure why Nate felt the need to reach out to my Senate office, rather than to his mom, dad, or sister, all of whom I am in contact with regularly,&quot; JD Vance told Fox News. The vice president added that he &quot;always considered Nate the toughest guy (he) knew&quot; and that he was &quot;always happy to talk to him.&quot; Nate Vance volunteered to fight in Ukraine following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, but left shortly before the U.S. presidential inauguration out of fear of being captured by the Russian army. &quot;It had become complicated to stay. I couldn&apos;t take the risk of being captured,&quot; he said. JD Vance has repeatedly criticized Ukraine and Zelensky in the past, at times repeating Kremlin talking points.	https://kyivindependent.com/didnt-want-to-endanger-his-life-jd-vance-on-criticism-from-his-cousin-former-volunteer-fighter-in-ukraine/	2025-03-11T10:35:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2198862659.jpg
France to 'refuse any demilitarization of Ukrainian army,' French defense minister says	France will not accept &quot;any demilitarization of the Ukrainian army,&quot; French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said on March 11, The Guardian reported. &quot;Demilitarization&quot; and &quot;denazification&quot; were two insincere excuses that the Kremlin used to invade Ukraine in a war of territorial and ethnocidal aggression in February 2022. The Ukrainian army is &quot;the main guarantee&quot; of Ukraine&apos;s security, Lecornu said in the opening remarks at the Paris Defence and Strategy Forum, which gathered over 30 army chiefs to discuss what Europe and the West can offer in support of Ukraine as part of a peace deal with Russia. The French defense minister added that Europe is facing a &quot;new period&quot; in its history, significantly different from the Cold War and the period of &quot;peace dividends&quot; with several powers fighting for influence. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Russia demanded that Ukraine reduce its army to 50,000 personnel. Moscow also sought to ensure that Kyiv &quot;did not develop, produce, purchase, or deploy missile weapons of any kind with a range of over 250 kilometers (156 miles) on its territory.&quot; Ukraine has repeatedly highlighted the need for security guarantees in the event of a ceasefire in the war with Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously stressed the need for a 1.5 million-strong army if Ukraine is not accepted into NATO. The Ukrainian army currently has 880,000 troops, making it the largest in Europe, according to Zelensky.	https://kyivindependent.com/france-to-refuse-any-demilitarisation-of-ukrainian-army-french-dm-says/	2025-03-11T10:31:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1695287073.jpg
Half of Ukrainians say territorial concessions, forfeiting NATO membership in exchange for ending war 'completely unacceptable'	According to a poll conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) at the request of the Kyiv Independent, 47.1% of Ukrainians consider it &quot;completely unacceptable&quot; to agree to territorial concessions and give up on NATO membership as a prerequisite to ending the war. Only 8.2% said they would &quot;easily agree&quot; to this scenario, while 38.1% of respondents called this option difficult but &quot;generally acceptable.&quot; 6.2% of respondents found it difficult to answer the question, and 0.4% declined to answer. The survey, commissioned by the Kyiv Independent, was conducted between Feb. 5 and March 10. 2,029 people took part, and the margin of error is a maximum of 2.1%. On March 10, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Kyiv would need to make territorial concessions as part of any agreement to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Foreign Ministry said that the country wasn&apos;t officially asked by Washington to agree to territorial concessions. NATO membership has also become increasingly elusive. &quot;You can forget about (NATO membership),&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump previously said. Russian forces continue to occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory. The Ukrainian population under Russian occupation has been subjected to systematic repression, torture, and abuse. President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested that to end the &quot;hot phase of the war,&quot; NATO would have to offer membership to Ukrainian territory under government control, with the invitation recognizing the country&apos;s internationally recognized borders. Bloomberg reported on March 10 that Russian President Vladimir Putin remains unwilling to compromise. Putin has deliberately set &quot;maximalist&quot; demands on territory, peacekeepers, and Ukraine&apos;s neutrality, knowing they will likely be unacceptable to Kyiv and European nations, the outlet wrote.	https://kyivindependent.com/47-of-ukrainians-oppose-to-refuse-from-nato-making-territorial-concession-in-exchange-for-ending-war-poll-shows/	2025-03-11T10:07:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1244707924.jpeg
US to inform Russia of US-Ukraine talks progress in Saudi Arabia, Peskov claims	Moscow is expecting to receive information from Washington on the progress of Ukraine-U.S. negotiations in Saudi Arabia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the Russian news agency Interfax on March 11. Peskov&apos;s statement comes amid the ongoing talks between the American and Ukrainian delegations in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. &quot;Today, there will be U.S.-Ukraine contacts in Jeddah. Somehow, the American side, which is looking for ways to reach a peaceful settlement, will inform us,&quot; Peskov said when asked about the potential meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s Middle East Envoy, Steve Witkoff. Witkoff was also supposed to attend the talks between Washington and Kyiv in Saudi Arabia but missed them. Multiple media outlets reported that Witkoff plans to travel to Moscow for a meeting with Putin. The reported trip to Moscow will follow the March 11 discussions between Ukrainian and U.S. officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Witkoff will join U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz on the American side. Despite being Trump&apos;s envoy for the Middle East, Witkoff has emerged as a leading figure in negotiations regarding Russia and Ukraine. On Feb. 18, he participated in talks with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia, which were held without Ukraine&apos;s participation.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-expecting-us-to-provide-information-on-talks-with-ukraine-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-03-11T08:47:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245735181.jpeg
Ukraine, US discuss potential ceasefire, deal on rare earth during 1st round of talks, media reports	The Ukrainian and American delegations discussed a potential ceasefire in the air and at sea, as well as a minerals deal, during the first round of talks in Saudi Arabia, Suspilne reported on March 11, citing an undisclosed source. Ukrainian and U.S. delegates began talks in Jeddah on March 11. The meeting could shape Washington&apos;s future support for Kyiv and efforts to end the war. Suspilne previously reported that Ukraine would propose a ceasefire at sea and in the sky and a ban on long-range strikes during the talks with the U.S. The official told the media outlet that such a ceasefire would be &quot;easy to install and to monitor.&quot; The mineral resource deal was derailed after a spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the White House on Feb. 28. Before the talks started, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that more details still needed to &quot;be worked out&quot; on the mineral resource deal between Ukraine and the U.S. Following the afternoon break, the second round of the talks started in Jeddah. The Ukrainian delegation includes Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa. The U.S. delegation is led by Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-us-discuss-potential-ceasefire-deal-on-rare-earth-during-1st-round-of-talks-media-reports/	2025-03-11T08:18:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204495015.jpg
Oil shipments via Druzhba pipeline halted due to Ukrainian drone attack in Russia, Hungary says	Oil supplies through the Druzhba pipeline from Russia to Hungary are halted due to a Ukrainian drone attack on a metering station on Russian territory, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on March 11 on Facebook. The Druzhba pipeline, one of the world&apos;s largest with a capacity of 2 million barrels per day (bpd), is a critical conduit for oil from Russian fields to European refineries. Hungary imports most of its crude oil via the Druzhba pipeline. Ukrainian forces reportedly struck the Druzhba pipeline in Russia&apos;s Oryol Oblast on March 11. Following the attack, Szijjarto said that the oil supply was halted. &quot;Due to the drone attack last night, crude shipments had to be suspended on the Druzhba oil pipeline to Hungary,&quot; Szijjarto said. &quot;I have just talked to the energy minister of Russia, who told me that due to the attack, shipments are not possible now, but works are underway, and if nothing extraordinary happens, then late afternoon or in the early evening, crude shipments to Hungary can resume,&quot; he added. The foreign minister called Ukraine to refrain from attacking the energy infrastructure supplying Hungary, as &quot;Hungary&apos;s energy supply is a matter of sovereignty.&quot; The EU has largely phased out Russian oil imports following Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. However, the Druzhba pipeline&apos;s southern branch remains active under exemptions for certain Central European countries. The northern branch primarily transports Kazakh crude oil to Germany via Poland&apos;s Gdansk port, as Poland ceased importing Russian pipeline oil in early 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/oil-shipments-via-druzhba-pipeline-halted-due-to-ukraines-attack-hungary-says/	2025-03-11T07:58:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--7-.jpg
White House lists Saudi talks with Ukraine, Russia in Trump's first 50 days achievements	The White House has listed the negotiations in Saudi Arabia with Ukraine and Russia as one of U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s key achievements on his 50th day in office on March 10. &quot;President Trump has brought Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table through historic peace talks in Saudi Arabia in pursuit of peace,&quot; the statement reads. U.S. officials met with Russian representatives in Riyadh on Feb. 18 and in Istanbul on Feb. 27 to discuss restoring bilateral relations and preliminary peace talks, excluding Ukraine. These discussions were followed by a Ukraine-U.S. meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11. Trump&apos;s overtures to Russia have raised concerns in Kyiv and Europe that the U.S. is sidelining its allies in pursuit of a swift settlement. Tensions between Kyiv and Washington have only escalated after Trump&apos;s heated exchange with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. Trump subsequently froze all U.S. military aid and restricted intelligence sharing with Ukraine, aiming to pressure Kyiv into peace talks. Meeting U.S. delegates in Saudi Arabia, Ukrainian officials are expected to push for the resumption of U.S. support while proposing a ceasefire in the air and at sea as a first step toward a broader peace agreement. Trump said earlier that he is considering imposing sweeping banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and peace deal are reached. The U.S. president claimed his position is based on the fact that Russia is &quot;absolutely pounding&quot; Ukraine, likely referring to Russian advances in Kursk Oblast or the large-scale missile and drone attack on March 7.	https://kyivindependent.com/white-house-highlights-saudi-negotiations-as-trumps-50-first-days-achievement/	2025-03-11T06:39:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2089735306.jpg

Ukraine targets Russian oil facilities in Moscow, Oryol oblasts in mass strike overnight, military claims	Ukrainian forces successfully attacked the Moscow Oil Refinery and a Druzhba oil pipeline facility in Oryol Oblast overnight on March 11, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. The statement comes after Russia claimed to have downed over 330 Ukrainian drones in the Moscow, Oryol, and eight other oblasts in a massive drone strike. The attack was carried out by Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces in cooperation with the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and military intelligence (HUR), the General Staff said. The operation &quot;struck a number of Russian strategic objects, enabling armed aggression against Ukraine,&quot; the military said. Ukraine has repeatedly targeted industrial and military facilities in Russia&apos;s rear to undermine Moscow&apos;s ability to wage its war. Multiple hits were recorded at the Moscow Oil Refinery, which is capable of processing 11 million metric tons of oil per year and covers 40-50% of Moscow&apos;s gasoline and diesel supplies, according to the statement. Explosions were also reported at the Stalnoy Kon fuel facility in Oryol Oblast. This facility is a key part of the Druzhba oil pipeline infrastructure and ensures oil supplies to the Ust-Luga port in Leningrad Oblast. The facility lies around 170 kilometers (100 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its forces had intercepted a massive strike of 337 Ukrainian drones across multiple regions, including 91 over Moscow Oblast, 126 over Kursk Oblast, 38 over Bryansk Oblast, eight over Oryol Oblast, and others over the Belgorod, Ryazan, Kaluga, Lipetsk, Voronezh, and Nizhny Novgorod regions. This would mark Ukraine&apos;s most extensive drone strike against Moscow and Russia throughout the full-scale war. Russian officials did not report hits against any strategic targets but claimed that civilian sites were damaged across Moscow Oblast. Three people were allegedly killed by drone debris, while 18 were wounded, Moscow claims. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The Ukrainian military said it has &quot;detailed information about the strategic facilities&quot; enabling Russian aggression and &quot;adheres to the norms of international humanitarian law and takes measures to protect the civilian population as much as possible.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-russian-oil-facilities-in-moscow-oryol-oblasts-overnight-military-claims/	2025-03-11T05:41:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1211156715.jpg
OSCE Secretary General visits Moscow, shown aftermath of Ukrainian drone strikes, Russia says	Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Secretary General Feridun Sinirlioglu, who visited Moscow on March 11, was shown the aftermath of reported Ukrainian drone attacks. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its air defenses intercepted 337 drones across multiple regions, including 74 shot down near Moscow, marking what seems to be Ukraine&apos;s largest drone attack during the full-scale war. Russia itself continues daily attacks on Ukraine with missiles, drones, and guided bombs. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported intercepting 79 of the 126 Russian drones launched overnight on March 11, along with one Iskander-M ballistic missile. Russian officials claimed that three people were killed in Moscow Oblast, including a security guard in Domodedovo and two men who later died in the hospital. Eighteen others, including three children, were injured, according to Russia&apos;s Health Ministry. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said the OSCE chief witnessed the damage firsthand, writing on Telegram, &quot;It is impossible to deny the obvious, especially what we have seen with our own eyes.&quot; Meanwhile, Andrey Kartapolov, head of Russia&apos;s State Duma Defense Committee, called for retaliatory strikes on Ukraine using the Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile. The strikes occurred just as Ukrainian and U.S. delegations were set to meet in Saudi Arabia to discuss possible peace terms with Russia. Ukrainian officials reportedly plan to propose a partial truce covering aerial and naval operations, hoping to restore U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing. The OSCE was formed in the 1970s at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which provided a platform for dialogue between the Eastern Bloc and Western Bloc during the Cold War. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov attended the OSCE Ministerial Meeting in Malta in person, the Foreign Ministry announced on Dec. 5.	https://kyivindependent.com/osce-secretary-general-visits-moscow-shown-aftermath-of-ukrainian-drone-strikes/	2025-03-11T05:11:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203925059.jpg
Ceasefire 'has never seemed closer,' Yermak writes but stresses need for security guarantees	Ukraine can achieve lasting peace with U.S. leadership, but this requires increased pressure on Russia and credible security guarantees, Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak wrote in an opinion article published by the Guardian on March 11. &quot;As I arrive in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, a ceasefire in the three-year war the Russian Federation has waged on my country has never seemed closer,&quot; Yermak wrote. Yermak nevertheless stressed that diplomacy alone will not bring about a ceasefire &#x2014; stronger political and financial pressure on Russia is essential to prevent a future resurgence of aggression. &quot;No one wants the current war to end more than our people &#x2014; but a peace must be found that is both just and sustainable,&quot; he added. Yermak outlined key conditions necessary for a sustainable peace, including security guarantees for Ukraine, tougher European sanctions against Russia, and the seizure of Russian frozen assets to support Ukraine. &quot;Europe cannot allow a ceasefire that serves only to allow Russia to rearm, rebuild its forces, and come back for more Ukrainian lands and resources,&quot; he warned. Despite Yermak&apos;s calls for U.S. involvement in security guarantees, President Donald Trump has refused to offer such assurances, saying during his Feb. 28 meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky that Europe should take responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security. Yermak welcomed Europe&apos;s ReArm Europe initiative, which includes up to 150 billion euros ($163 billion) for collective defense spending and an additional 20 billion euros ($21 billion) for Ukraine&apos;s military needs. The official also highlighted the importance of the EU&apos;s recently approved 16th sanctions package of sanctions, which expands export restrictions and targets Russian aluminum imports. The column was published as Ukrainian and U.S. delegates began talks in Jeddah on March 11. The meeting could shape Washington&apos;s future support for Kyiv and efforts to end the war. The Ukrainian delegation includes Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa. The U.S. delegation is led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.	https://kyivindependent.com/lasting-peace-in-ukraine-requires-increased-pressure-on-russia-security-guarantees-yermak-says/	2025-03-11T04:44:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204495015.jpg
Ukrainian serviceman saves stabbing victim in Venice	Editor&apos;s note: The article contains graphic content. A Ukrainian soldier on leave provided first aid to a victim of a stabbing attack in Venice on March 10, saving his life, according to the soldier&apos;s testimony and the Italian media. The incident occurred at 4:37 p.m. on March 10. A young man of a North African origin was stabbed after getting into an altercation with another man in Venice&apos;s historical center, the Corriere del Veneto newspaper reported. The injured man began bleeding and collapsed, while the assailant fled the scene. The vacationing Ukrainian soldier who was passing by aided the victim while other bystanders alerted the authorities, the newspaper wrote. &quot;The boy was lucky that I was nearby with a first aid kit and tourniquets. Otherwise, the s**t would have leaked out by the time the ambulance arrived,&quot; the soldier, who goes by the name Kapitan (Captain) Dvizhukha on social media, wrote. The identity of the victim and the attacker or the motivation behind the attack remain unclear.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-serviceman-saves-stabbing-victim-in-venice/	2025-03-11T04:03:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2161312993--1-.jpg
87% of Ukrainians believe Russia will not stop at occupied territories, survey finds	A vast majority of Ukrainians believe that Russia is determined to destroy Ukraine and will not stop at the territories it currently occupies, according to a survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published on March 11. The survey comes as U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on March 10 that Ukraine would need to make territorial concessions as part of any agreement to end the war. According to KIIS, 87% of Ukrainians believe that Russia intends to continue its aggression beyond the currently occupied territories. This belief is consistent across all regions, with 80% in the east and south and 89-90% in the west and center agreeing that Moscow will not stop at the current front line. Furthermore, 66% of respondents said that Russia&apos;s ultimate goal is Ukraine&apos;s destruction &#x2014; 28% believe Moscow seeks physical genocide, while 38% say it aims to seize most or all of Ukraine&apos;s territory and eliminate its statehood and national identity. A further 14% believe Russia seeks to occupy all or most of Ukraine and install a puppet government, while 7% think Moscow wants to consolidate control over the partially-occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. The findings align with Russian statements, as Russia&apos;s Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said on Dec. 16, 2024, that Moscow aims to capture the entirety of the four Ukrainian oblasts in 2025. Only 4% of respondents believe that Russia aims to maintain control over its existing territorial gains, and just 3% accept Russia&apos;s claim that it wants to &quot;denazify&quot; and demilitarize Ukraine. The remaining 7% were undecided. The survey was conducted between Feb. 14 and March 4, with 1,029 respondents aged 18 and older interviewed by telephone across all Ukrainian government-controlled regions. The survey results come amid growing concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s push for a swift end to the war could lead to a peace deal on unfavorable terms for Ukraine, potentially leaving it vulnerable to future Russian attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/87-of-ukrainians-believe-russia-will-not-stop-at-occupied-territories-survey-finds/	2025-03-11T03:32:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/kyiv.jpeg
Russian lawmaker proposes Oreshnik strike following Ukraine's mass drone attack	Russia should strike Ukraine using the Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile, said Andrey Kartapolov, head of Russia&#x2019;s State Duma Defense Committee, on March 11. The call for action comes in response to what seems to be the largest Ukrainian drone attack since the start of the full-scale war. &quot;The decision is up to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief (Russian President Vladimir Putin), but I think it would not be unreasonable (to launch the Oreshnik), better even more than one,&#x201D; Kartapolov said, as quoted by Russian state-owned news agency TASS. Kartapolov&#x2019;s comments follow reports from Russia&#x2019;s Defense Ministry that its air defenses intercepted a wave of 337 drones across multiple regions, with 74 reportedly shot down on approach to Moscow. In turn, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported intercepting 79 of the 126 Russian drones and one Iskander-M ballistic missile launched the same night. Russia conducts daily strikes on Ukraine using missiles, drones, and guided bombs. Russia has launched the Oreshnik missile against Ukraine once before, striking Dnipro in November 2024 after Kyiv successfully used U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles to hit a military target on Russian soil. Putin described the Oreshnik strike as a response to Ukraine&#x2019;s use of Western long-range weapons to strike inside Russia. While Putin announced plans for mass production of the Oreshnik, a U.S. official told the Kyiv Independent that Russia likely possessed only a small number of these experimental missiles. Following the November strike, the Moscow Times reported that the Kremlin staged a media blitz around the attack, citing Russian officials who said the campaign was designed to intimidate the West and deter further arms deliveries to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-lawmaker-proposes-oreshnik-icbm-strike-following-ukraines-largest-drone-attack/	2025-03-11T03:04:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2185403348.jpg
Russia claims to recapture 12 Kursk Oblast settlements amid new offensive	Russian forces have recaptured 12 settlements and 100 square kilometers (40 square miles) in Kursk Oblast previously held by Ukrainian troops, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed on March 11. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified. The statement comes after Moscow launched a new offensive in the Russian border region, reportedly achieving a breakthrough south of the key town of Sudzha in an effort to encircle the Ukrainian salient. Russia recaptured the settlements of Agronom, Bogdanovka, Bondarevka, Dmitryukov, Zazulevka, Ivashkovsky, Kolmakov, Kubatkin, Martynovka, Mikhailovka, Pravda, and Yuzhny in recent military operations, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed. The DeepState monitoring group confirmed significant territorial losses on Ukraine&apos;s part in Kursk Oblast since Russia launched its offensive last week. The extent of the Ukrainian salient in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast as of March 10, 2025, according to the DeepState monitoring group. (DeepState/OpenStreet Maps)Russian troops and their North Korean allies have also reportedly begun launching attacks in the Sudzha area. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, claimed that there is currently no threat of encirclement as Ukrainian troops are moving to &quot;favorable defense lines.&quot; Syrskyi added that some of the settlements Russia claims to have retaken &quot;no longer exist&quot; as they have been destroyed by Russian fire. Ukraine&apos;s commander-in-chief added that he had decided to reinforce Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast with &quot;the necessary forces and means,&quot; including electronic warfare and drones. Concerns about the Ukrainian operation in Kursk Oblast, ongoing since August 2024, have mounted over the weekend amid reports of Russian advances. The development came shortly after the U.S. cut off military and intelligence support for Ukraine, allegedly to push Kyiv to the negotiating table.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-to-recapture-12-kursk-oblast-settlements-amid-new-offensive/	2025-03-11T02:55:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167241364.jpg
US 'will not be providing' military aid to Russia, Rubio says	The United States will not provide military aid to Russia, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on March 10 in a curious comment ahead of U.S.-Ukraine talks. Asked whether the Ukrainian delegation would push for renewed military aid during the meeting in Saudi Arabia, Rubio responded, &quot;I can assure you this: We will not be providing military aid to the Russians.&quot; The U.S. has been a key military supporter of Ukraine during the full-scale war. As relations between Kyiv and Washington soured after U.S. President Donald Trump took office, the new administration halted all defense assistance. Regarding the possibility of resuming U.S. military aid to Ukraine, Rubio suggested that the freeze could be lifted if Ukraine committed to peace talks. &quot;I mean, all of that came about because we felt that they were not committed to any sort of peace process or not interested in negotiations,&quot; Rubio said. Ukrainian officials plan to use the Jeddah talks to push for the resumption of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing, Financial Times reported on March 9. U.S. delegates previously held meetings with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 and in Istanbul on Feb. 27, where they discussed restoring bilateral relations and holding preliminary peace talks without Ukraine&#x2019;s participation.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-will-not-be-providing-military-aid-to-russia-rubio-says/	2025-03-11T02:20:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193483462.jpg
BREAKING: Ukraine, US begin key meeting in Saudi Arabia	Ukrainian and U.S. delegates are starting their talks in Jeddah on March 11 in a meeting that will likely have a major impact on Washington&apos;s future support for Kyiv and any effort to end the Russia-Ukraine war. &quot;A meeting of the Ukrainian and American delegations begins in Jeddah,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry announced. The Ukrainian delegation is said to include President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa. The U.S. delegation is led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. The expectations are high as the meeting presents a chance to mend the relations between Kyiv and Washington after a heated exchange between Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. Zelensky visited Saudi Arabia on March 10 to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman but will not participate in the talks with U.S. delegates. 0:00/1&#xD7;A Ukrainian delegation, including President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, arrive for talks with U.S. officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11, 2025. (Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry)The televised spat in the White House led to the U.S. suspending all military aid and restricting intelligence support for Ukraine, endangering its ability to resist Russia&apos;s all-out war. Ukrainian officials aim to push for the resumption of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing at the Jeddah talks, the Financial Times reported on March 9. Ukraine will also reportedly propose a ceasefire in the air and at sea as the first step toward a peaceful settlement. While traveling to the meeting, Rubio said that Ukraine would need to make territorial concessions as part of any peaceful settlement. The meeting could also see progress on the minerals deal that has been on hold since the White House clash. &quot;The most important thing that we have to leave here with is a strong sense that Ukraine is prepared to do difficult things, like the Russians are going to have to do difficult things to end this conflict or at least pause it in some way, shape or form,&quot; Rubio told reporters on March 10, according to the New York Times. U.S. officials had previously met with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 and in Istanbul on Feb. 27 to discuss restoring bilateral relations and holding preliminary peace talks without Ukraine&apos;s involvement.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-us-begin-crucial-meeting-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-03-11T02:03:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204479826.jpg
US has not discussed Russia sanctions relief with EU, Rubio says	The U.S. has not discussed easing sanctions against Russia with the European Union, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on March 10, ahead of a meeting with Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia. Asked whether Washington had engaged in talks with the EU about rolling back sanctions imposed in response to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Rubio said, &quot;We&apos;ve not gotten to that stage.&quot; &quot;Obviously, the Europeans have their own set of sanctions, and we can&apos;t &#x2014; they&apos;ll have to make the decision about what they&apos;re willing to do,&quot; he added. Rubio emphasized that any final resolution to the war would have to involve European leaders &quot;because of their sanctions that they&apos;ve imposed.&quot; The U.S. has the means to increase pressure on Russia if necessary, but Rubio expressed hope that such measures would not be required. On March 7, U.S. President Donald Trump said he is considering imposing additional banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and peace agreement are established. Since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has been subjected to extensive economic sanctions from both the U.S. and the EU. The EU&apos;s sanctions framework includes economic restrictions and a list of over 2,400 individuals and entities subject to asset freezes and travel bans.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-has-not-discussed-russia-sanctions-relief-with-eu-rubio-says/	2025-03-11T01:48:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203802681.jpg
1 killed, 17 injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over past day	At least one person was killed and 17 others injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over the past day, regional officials reported on March 11. Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force intercepted 79 of the 126 Russian drones launched overnight, including Shahed-type attack drones, as well as one Iskander-M ballistic missile. Another 35 drones reportedly disappeared from radars before reaching their targets, likely acting as decoys to overwhelm Ukraine&#x2019;s air defenses. Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare systems, aviation, and mobile fire groups repelled the attack. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian strikes killed one person and injured two in Pokrovsk and injured one in Kostiantynivka, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Russian shelling and air strikes wounded 11 people in Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. A 61-year-old man was injured in Kharkiv Oblast when a Russian attack drone struck a warehouse roof, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. One civilian was also wounded in Sumy Oblast in a Russian drone strike, the regional military administration said. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, a 79-year-old woman was injured in a Russian attack, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. In Odesa Oblast, a house, a children&#x2019;s toy warehouse, and a fuel tank caught fire in a massive Russian drone assault. Authorities are still clarifying information on casualties, Governor Oleh Kiper said.	https://kyivindependent.com/1-killed-17-injured-in-russian-attacks-against-ukraine-over-past-day/	2025-03-11T01:09:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-11_05-37-11.jpg
Russia's Gazprom faces almost $20 billion in lawsuits from European energy firms	European energy firms have filed lawsuits against Russian energy giant Gazprom totaling 18 billion euros ($19.6 billion) over gas supply cuts, the Moscow Times reported on March 10. The claims stem from Gazprom&apos;s decision to drastically reduce gas deliveries to Europe in 2022 after Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that payments be made in rubles. When European customers refused, Gazprom significantly cut supplies, including through the Nord Stream pipeline. The total amount of claims against Gazprom is nearly equal to its net revenues from gas exports, which include $10 billion from sales to Europe and Turkey, $7 billion from China, and $2 billion from Central Asia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The largest lawsuit was filed by German energy company Uniper, formerly Gazprom&apos;s biggest client in Germany and a co-investor in the Nord Stream 2 project. The company imported 20 billion cubic meters of Russian gas annually and is seeking 14.3 billion euros ($15.5 billion) in damages over losses incurred after Russian supplies were halted. Gazprom has responded with counterclaims in Russian courts, seeking to block legal proceedings outside Russia. The Financial Times reported on March 2 that Matthias Warnig, a former Stasi officer and longtime ally of Putin, has been lobbying the U.S. to support a potential restart of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The pipeline, which was co-financed by five European energy firms, was severely damaged in an apparent sabotage attack in September 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-gazprom-faces-19-5-billion-in-lawsuits-from-european-energy-firms-over-gas-cuts/	2025-03-11T00:38:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1243251198.jpg
Ukrainian delegation on-site ahead of talks with US in Saudi Arabia, Yermak says	A Ukrainian delegation is on-site in Jeddah and preparing for key talks with U.S. officials on how to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine on March 11, Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak said. &quot;Protecting Ukrainian interests, clear vision on how to end the war; we will work effectively with our American partners,&quot; Yermak said on Telegram. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously announced that the Ukrainian delegation would include Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa. Although Zelensky arrived in Saudi Arabia on March 10 for a separate meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, he will not participate in the official negotiations. The U.S. delegation includes Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, and Trump&apos;s special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff. The meeting follows heightened tensions between Kyiv and Washington after Zelensky clashed with U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. Shortly after, Washington suspended all military aid to Ukraine, and CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed on March 5 that the U.S. had also halted intelligence sharing, potentially limiting Ukraine&apos;s ability to conduct long-range attacks. Ukrainian officials aim to push for the resumption of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing at the Jeddah talks, Financial Times reported on March 9. According to Suspilne, Ukraine will propose a ceasefire in the air and at sea, along with a ban on long-range strikes, describing it as a step that would be &quot;easy to install and to monitor.&quot; Meanwhile, the U.S. delegation is expected to press Kyiv to accept a partial truce as a foundation for negotiations to end the war, Bloomberg reported on March 10. U.S. officials had previously met with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 and in Istanbul on Feb. 27 to discuss restoring bilateral relations and holding preliminary peace talks without Ukraine&apos;s involvement.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-delegation-preparing-for-talks-with-us-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-03-10T23:47:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1247528162.jpg

Russian air defenses allegedly shot down 69 Ukrainian drones over Moscow overnight on March 11 in what may be the most extensive strike against Russia&apos;s capital during the full-scale war. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claims its forces intercepted 337 drones across multiple regions, including 91 over Moscow Oblast, 126 over Kursk Oblast, and 38 over Bryansk Oblast.

Witkoff to meet Putin in Moscow, media reports	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s Middle East Envoy, Steve Witkoff, plans to travel to Moscow for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the coming days, multiple media outlets reported on March 10, citing sources familiar with the matter. Witkoff previously traveled to Moscow in February for the release of U.S. teacher Marc Fogel from a Russian prison. Witkoff claimed that he spoke directly with Putin for over three hours during his visit. Witkoff is expected to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during an upcoming visit to Moscow, an unnamed source told Bloomberg on March 10. Two people briefed on the plans later confirmed the reports in comments to Reuters. The reported trip to Moscow will follow the March 11 discussions between Ukrainian and U.S. officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Witkoff will join U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz on the American side. There is an &quot;expectation&quot; that the two sides will make &quot;substantial progress&quot; during the talks, Witkoff told Fox News in an interview on March 10. &quot;What&apos;s on the table, what&apos;s important to discuss are obviously security protocols for the Ukrainians, they care about that,&quot; Witkoff said. The talks carry high stakes for Ukraine, as the U.S. has frozen military aid and stopped intelligence sharing with Kyiv. Officials have said the outcome of the talks may determine whether Washington resumes support. Despite being Trump&apos;s envoy for the Middle East, Witkoff has emerged as a leading figure in negotiations regarding Russia and Ukraine. He previously took part in talks with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18, held without Ukraine&apos;s participation.	https://kyivindependent.com/witkoff-to-meet-putin-in-moscow-sources-claim/	2025-03-10T22:40:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197640711.jpg
58 drones shot down over Moscow, mayor claims	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Fifty-eight drones were shot down as they approached the city of Moscow in the early hours of March 11, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin claimed. &quot;Emergency services are working at the site of the fallen debris,&quot; Sobyanin said. Eleven drones were shot down over the Ramensky district on the outskirts of Moscow, the mayor claimed. Sobyanin attributed the attack to the Ukrainian military. The Kyiv Independent could not verify Sobyanin&apos;s claims, and Ukraine&apos;s military has not yet commented on the attack. &quot;According to preliminary data, there is no damage or casualties at the site where the debris fell,&quot; Sobyanin said. Domodedovo and Zhukovsky airports in Moscow introduced temporary flight restrictions in response to the drone attack, Russia&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) reported. A residential building was hit in the city of Vidnoye, a suburb of Moscow, local officials claimed. Drones were also shot down over Russia&apos;s Ryazan Oblast and Tula Oblast, according to Russian officials.

Over 30 nations to join Paris talks on Ukraine security	Military officials from over 30 countries will attend discussions in Paris on establishing an international security force for Ukraine, an unnamed French military official told the Associated Press (AP) on March 10. European officials led by the U.K. and France have been developing a &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; to enforce a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. U.S. officials have repeatedly said Europe must bear responsibility for a ceasefire while refusing to offer concrete security guarantees. Representatives from Europe, Asia, and Oceania will meet in person and virtually on March 11, coinciding with a meeting between Ukrainian and U.S. officials on the same day in Saudi Arabia. Ukraine will be represented by a military official in Paris, the French official told the AP, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The U.S. was not invited to the event in an effort to demonstrate to White House officials that Europe can guarantee peace in Ukraine. &quot;It&apos;s not, &apos;This is what we need,&apos;&quot; the official said. &quot;It&#x2019;s more, &apos;What are you bringing to the pot?&apos;&quot; The force could be backed by heavy weaponry and weapons stockpiles that could be quickly delivered to the front line in the event Russia breaks a ceasefire, the official said. The talks will consist of two parts, the source said. In the first part, the U.K. and France will introduce their joint initiative. The second part will involve discussions, giving military officials a chance to share how their countries may contribute to the force. While talks on security guarantees have largely been based in Europe, officials from Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea will participate, the unnamed official said.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-30-nations-will-partake-in-paris-talks-on-ukraine-security/	2025-03-10T21:38:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/UNESCO.jpg
Musk blames X outage on 'massive cyberattack' linked to Ukraine	The social media platform X experienced waves of outages on March 10, which X owner and billionaire CEO Elon Musk attributed to a &quot;massive cyberattack&quot; linked to IP addresses originating in Ukraine. &quot;(W)e&apos;re not sure exactly what happened, but there was a massive cyberattack to try to bring down the ecosystem with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area,&quot; Musk told Fox Business. Musk claimed in a post on X that the attack was carried out &quot;with a lot of resources.&quot; &quot;Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved,&quot; he said. Cybersecurity experts have expressed skepticism of Musk&apos;s claims. Cyberattacks of this type, known as denial of service (DDoS) attacks, can be carried out by small groups or individual hackers. DDoS attacks direct excessive amounts of traffic at a website in order to overload its servers, often causing disruptions to service. An industry source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters that much of the traffic targeting X could be traced to IP addresses in the U.S., Vietnam, Brazil, and other countries. The amount of traffic coming from Ukraine was &quot;insignificant,&quot; the source said. Musk, who purchased X (then Twitter) in 2022, has a history of attributing technical glitches to cyberattacks. He also has a history of making inflammatory remarks and amplifying disinformation about Ukraine. .On the same day as the alleged cyberattack, Musk called U.S. Senator Mark Kelly a &quot;traitor&quot; for sharing details of his visit to wartime Ukraine. In his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), established by U.S. President Donald Trump, Musk has spearheaded the slashing of humanitarian aid to Kyiv and called to shut down U.S.-funded media outlets in Ukraine. These outlets are a waste of &quot;taxpayer money,&quot; responsible for &quot;torching&quot; up to a billion dollars in U.S. funds, Musk said. Musk is currently listed as the world&apos;s richest man alive.	https://kyivindependent.com/musk-blames-x-outage-on-massive-cyberattack-linked-to-ukraine/	2025-03-10T21:13:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202898156.jpg
Zelensky apologized to Trump for Oval Office clash, Witkoff claims	President Volodymyr Zelensky apologized for the heated argument in the White House between him and U.S. President Donald Trump, U.S. Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff said in a television interview with Fox News on March 10. Witkoff is part of a U.S. delegation set to meet Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia on March 11 in the first high-level talks between the two nations since the White House clash. &quot;Zelensky sent a letter to the president. He apologized for that whole incident that happened in the Oval Office. I think that was an important step,&quot; Witkoff said. Top White House officials demanded an apology from Zelensky in the aftermath of the Oval Office clash on Feb. 28. Zelensky issued a conciliatory statement on March 4 calling the incident &quot;regrettable&quot; and saying he was ready to work towards peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; It is not clear whether Witkoff was framing that statement as an apology or referencing other communications between Zelensky and Trump. Witkoff also said that there have been ongoing discussions among Ukrainian, U.S., and European officials since the incident, and expressed optimism that the upcoming talks in Saudi Arabia could revive the collapsed minerals deal between Washington and Kyiv. &quot;I would like to describe it as progress ... I would hope that there&apos;s a deal,&quot; Witkoff said. There is an &quot;expectation&quot; that the two sides will make &quot;substantial progress&quot; during the talks, he said. &quot;What&apos;s on the table, what&apos;s important to discuss are obviously security protocols for the Ukrainians, they care about that .... These are not complicated things,&quot; Witkoff said. &quot;They just need to be put on the table and everybody needs to be transparent about what their expectations are. Then we can begin to have a discussion around how we compromise.&quot; Ukrainian-U.S. relations reached a low point following the White House clash, as Washington paused military aid to Kyiv and stopped sharing critical intelligence. Witkoff claimed earlier in the interview that the U.S. had not stopped sharing intelligence needed for defensive purposes. The freeze on military aid has drawn criticism even from members of Trump&apos;s own party. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said that pulling aid from Ukraine in the midst of Russia&apos;s war would &quot;be worse than Afghanistan.&quot; U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that if the Saudi Arabia talks were successful, Washington might resume military aid to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-apologized-for-oval-office-clash-witkoff-says/	2025-03-10T20:15:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199709214.jpg
Zelensky, Saudi crown prince discuss return of POWs, Ukrainian children	President Volodymyr Zelensky held talks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on March 10, ahead of a planned meeting between U.S. and Ukrainian officials, the Presidential Office reported. Zelensky&apos;s team will remain in Jeddah to meet U.S. delegates and discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement with Russia on March 11. Zelensky is not expected to participate in the negotiations. The two leaders discussed Saudi Arabia&apos;s potential role in mediating the release of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) as well as the return of Ukrainian children who were illegally deported to Russia, the Presidential Office said. The Gulf countries have traditionally played the role of mediators between Russia and Ukraine, particularly in regard to prisoner exchanges. Zelensky and bin Salman also discussed possible security guarantees for Ukraine and strategies for bringing about &quot;a just and lasting peace.&quot; Zelensky spoke to the prince about Ukraine&apos;s plans to bolster defense production and the potential for cooperation with Saudi Arabia in this sector. Ukraine is interested in further developing cooperation with Saudi Arabia in the areas of trade and energy, the Presidential Office said. The leaders discussed the potential for future Saudi investments in Ukraine and Riyadh&apos;s contributions to Kyiv&apos;s reconstruction efforts. Zelensky initially intended to visit Saudi Arabia as part of a Middle East tour in February but delayed the trip due to bilateral U.S.-Russian talks in Riyadh on Feb. 18. The Saudi crown prince &#xA0;reportedly wanted Ukraine represented at that meeting, but was overruled by U.S. and Russian officials. The March 11 U.S.-Ukraine talks mark the first high-level meeting between the two nations since Zelensky&apos;s disastrous visit to the White House on Feb. 28. Following the meeting &#x2014;&#xA0;during which U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Zelensky and accused him of being ungrateful &#x2014;&#xA0;Washington froze military aid and paused intelligence sharing with Kyiv. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on March 10 that a successful meeting in Jeddah could lead to Washington resuming military aid deliveries. Rubio also said that Ukraine would need to agree to territorial concessions as part of a peace deal. Rubio will take part in the Jeddah talks alongside Trump&apos;s Middle East Envoy, Steve Witkoff, and U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. They will meet with Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff, Pavlo Palisa.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-saudi-crown-prince-discuss-return-of-pows-ukrainian-children/	2025-03-10T19:12:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/zel.jpeg
Musk calls Sen. Mark Kelly a 'traitor' over Ukraine trip, Kelly pushes back	Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur and head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), called Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly a &quot;traitor&quot; in a post on X after the senator shared details of his visit to Ukraine. In a thread on March 9, Kelly posted photos from the trip, emphasizing that while everyone wants the war to end, any agreement must protect Ukraine&#x2019;s security and not serve as a concession to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Musk responded directly to the post, accusing Kelly of betrayal. Kelly, a former Navy pilot and astronaut, swiftly replied, criticizing Musk&#x2019;s stance. &quot;Traitor? Elon, if you don&apos;t understand that defending freedom is a basic tenet of what makes America great and keeps us safe, maybe you should leave it to those of us who do,&quot; he wrote on March 10. Speaking to reporters later, Kelly dismissed Musk as &quot;not a serious guy&quot; and suggested he should &#x201C;go back to building rockets&#x201D; rather than engaging in political matters. The senator also accused Musk of prioritizing the interests of billionaires over the American people, pointing to his influence in government policies, including budget cuts affecting veterans&#x2019; services. During his visit to Ukraine, Kelly met with government officials, embassy staff, and military leaders. He described the trip as emotional, stressing the urgency of delivering munitions and intelligence support to Ukrainian forces. &quot;This is existential for them, and again, over the past week or so, we&apos;ve made it harder for them,&quot; he said, referring to recent U.S. policy shifts. Kelly warned that delays in providing military aid would lead to more Ukrainian casualties, adding, &quot;They will stick with us. We stick with them. They will be there for us in the future, no matter what we need.&quot; Musk&#x2019;s comments come amid heightened tensions in U.S.-Ukraine relations, following a contentious Oval Office meeting between President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. &#xA0; The discussion escalated into a heated exchange, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance blaming Zelensky for the war, despite Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. The meeting ended without an agreement that would have granted the U.S. access to Ukraine&#x2019;s mineral resources&#x2014;an arrangement Kyiv had hoped would secure continued American military support. Kelly, along with other Democratic lawmakers, has been vocal in opposing the Trump administration&#x2019;s shift away from strong U.S. backing for Ukraine. &quot;If we abandon our ally Ukraine, we will be viewed by other countries including our other allies as untrustworthy and in the future we shouldn&apos;t expect their help,&quot; he posted on X.	https://kyivindependent.com/musk-calls-sen-mark-kelly-a-traitor-over-ukraine-trip-kelly-pushes-back/	2025-03-10T17:27:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1674560753.jpg
Ukrainian lawmakers propose George Washington monument in Kyiv	A group of Ukrainian lawmakers has proposed erecting a monument in Kyiv to George Washington, the first president of the United States. A draft resolution for the monument was published on the website of Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, on March 10, under the number 3066. While the full text of the resolution has not been disclosed, it has already been submitted for consideration by parliamentary leadership. The initiative was put forward by lawmakers from the ruling Servant of the People party&#x2014;Oleksandr Kovalchuk, Mariia Mezentseva-Fedorenko, Yevheniia Kravchuk, and Halyna Yanchenko&#x2014;as well as independent MP Mykola Tyshchenko, who was expelled from President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s party in 2023. In an interview with the YouTube channel Superposition, Yanchenko emphasized the importance of strengthening ties between Ukraine and the United States rather than damaging them. She suggested that the monument could serve as a symbolic gesture of goodwill. Potential locations for the statue include sites where monuments to Soviet military figures Mykola Vatutin, a Soviet commander during World War II, and Mykola Shchors, a Bolshevik commander during the Russian Civil War, were previously dismantled.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-lawmakers-propose-george-washington-monument-in-kyiv/	2025-03-10T16:56:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2078569904.jpg
Denmark potentially open to sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine	Denmark is prepared to contribute troops if European peacekeeping forces are needed in Ukraine, Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said on March 10. Following a meeting of Denmark&#x2019;s parliament, the ministers said that the government had clarified its stance and received broad support from multiple parties. &quot;It is important that we in Europe send the right signals both to Putin and to Washington. That is what we are doing today by saying: If it comes to the point where a European presence is needed for a ceasefire or peace agreement to be reached, then Denmark is in principle prepared for that,&quot; Rasmussen said, according to Danish Broadcasting Corporation. According to a poll published by the Ritzau news agency on Feb. 21, about 53% of Danes support sending peacekeepers to Ukraine after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war comes to an end. Despite Denmark&#x2019;s readiness, Poulsen emphasized that no concrete plans have been made at this stage. Any potential deployment would depend on future developments. &quot;We have not made a decision to make a concrete effort. It must depend on how things develop. Therefore, this is an expression of timely care,&quot; he explained, highlighting that Denmark&#x2019;s position remains conditional on the evolving situation in Ukraine. Poulsen does not foresee all of NATO-member countries spearheading a peacekeeping mission but expects several individual states to provide security assurances to Ukraine. &quot;Now the initiative has been taken by the French and British sides to form an overview of what could potentially be needed,&quot; he said, noting ongoing discussions about what such a mission might entail. The specifics of Denmark&#x2019;s potential troop contribution remain unclear, as Poulsen indicated it is too soon to determine which soldiers might be deployed. He also stressed that any commitment to Ukraine must not come at the expense of security in the Baltic region.	https://kyivindependent.com/denmark-potentially-open-to-sending-peacekeeping-troops-to-ukraine/	2025-03-10T15:49:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166322485.jpg
UK to host virtual summit on Ukraine on March 15 as peacekeeping plans advance	U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer will host a virtual summit on March 15 to discuss support for Ukraine, following up on a similar meeting held in London earlier this month. Downing Street confirmed the gathering, which will bring together world leaders to assess the prospects for Ukraine and ongoing military assistance. &quot;You can expect the prime minister to host a second leaders&#x2019; meeting of the coalition of the willing, building on his Lancaster House summit,&quot; Starmer&#x2019;s spokesperson told reporters, referring to the March 2 meeting in London. As the U.K. and France continue discussions on forming a peacekeeping force for Ukraine, they remain the only countries to have publicly committed to sending troops. Other nations are expected to contribute either military personnel or other forms of support, though Russia has shown no willingness to accept such a deployment. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has provided little reassurance regarding a potential American security guarantee for Ukraine. Addressing recent comments from Trump, Starmer&#x2019;s spokesperson pushed back against U.S. president&apos;s assertion that Ukraine &quot;may not survive&quot; the war against Russia. &quot;We&#x2019;ve always said that Ukraine, at the other end of this process, must emerge as a sovereign territory,&quot; the spokesperson added, reinforcing the U.K.&apos;s commitment to Ukrainian independence and territorial integrity. Ongoing diplomatic and military talks between the U.K. and France aim to outline the structure and responsibilities of the proposed peacekeeping force. This week, U.K. Defense Minister John Healey and Chief of the Defense Staff Tony Radakin are scheduled to visit France for separate discussions on Ukraine. In addition, Foreign Secretary David Lammy will meet with G7 counterparts in Canada to further coordinate international support for Kyiv. On March 10, Lammy also spoke with U.S. Seceretary of State Marco Rubio and Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minsiter Andrii Sybiha about &quot;how we keep the process for peace moving forward ahead of discussions in Saudi Arabia.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-to-host-virtual-summit-on-ukraine-on-march-15-as-peacekeeping-plans-advance/	2025-03-10T14:34:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2200011633.jpg
Despite Russian-backed Georgescu barred from presidential race, Romania's far-right still aim to win	Protests erupted in downtown Bucharest following the Central Electoral Bureau&apos;s decision to ban Russian-backed far-right politician Calin Georgescu from running in the upcoming re-run presidential elections. Georgescu, who is openly supported by the Russian and the U.S. administrations, said this was a &quot;direct hit against democracy.&quot; Following the announcement on March 9, Georgescu&apos;s supporters began setting the streets of Bucharest on fire and throwing bottles, stones, and firecrackers at the police. Riot police used tear gas in response. In November 2024, the relatively unknown Georgescu surprisingly won the first round of the vote. The result was promptly annulled, citing foreign interference in the election process. In connection to the case, Romania expelled the Russian military attache and his deputy for breaching diplomatic rules of conduct. Now, the Central Electoral Bureau cited technical irregularities in Georgescu&apos;s application, as well as the Constitutional Court&apos;s decisions to cancel the previous round of voting and ban another Russian-backed candidate, Diana Sosoaca. Supporters of far-right presidential candidate Calin Georgescu wave the Romanian flag as they face Romanian gendarmes during a protest near the Central Electoral Bureau in Bucharest on March 9, 2025, after the electoral bureau rejected Georgescu&apos;s candidacy for the re-run of last year&apos;s annulled presidential election. (Daniel Mihailescu/AFP via Getty Images)Georgescu said he would appeal, and the Constitutional Court will have the final say on his expulsion from the race. &quot;The decision was inevitable for the health of democracy, but this democracy will need deep repairs after elections in May,&quot; journalist Magda Gradinaru told Kyiv Independent. &quot;Romania&apos;s secret services failed in the final goal of preventing this crisis and they will need to be reformed (as well),&quot; she added. &quot;It is to be seen who will capitalize on Georgescu&apos;s electoral ban and to what extent social tensions can morph into violent social movements,&quot; said Gradinaru. &quot;This was a short-term solution, but the extremist populist platform remains, as does Russian pressure, social resentment, and tension. So this may just be the beginning of a crisis that Romania will have to manage in a complicated geopolitical context,&quot; she added. The leader of the far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) party, George Simion, said on Sunday evening that &quot;those who organized the &apos;coup&apos; should be skinned alive in the public square.&quot; He called on people to take part in protests in support of Georgescu. On Monday morning, Simion claimed his words were a &quot;metaphor,&quot; and he asked supporters to protest peacefully. Georgescu appeared publicly, holding hands with Simion and Anamaria Gavrila, the leader of another Romanian far-right project, Party of Young People (POT).

(Andrei Pungovschi/Getty Images)Georgescu was expelled from AUR in 2022 after being briefly investigated for declarations in support of Romania&apos;s World War II fascist leaders. Now, Georgescu relies on AUR and POT for support. In the December parliamentary elections, AUR secured second place with 18% of the vote, while POT gained 6.5%. Both remained in opposition. &quot;If Simion runs for president, some of the tension created by Georgescu&apos;s ban will be eliminated,&quot; analyst Oana Popescu Zamfir told Kyiv Independent. Romanian protesters take part in an anti-government rally on March 1, 2025 in Bucharest, Romania. Calin Georgescu, a pro-Russian candidate who won the first round of last year&apos;s election that was subsequently cancelled, was questioned by prosecutors earlier this week about the financing of his campaign. (Andrei Pungovschi/Getty Images)According to her, Simion&apos;s recent radical statements are meant to incentivize Georgescu&apos;s supporters to vote for him. &quot;It&apos;s important for Georgescu to explicitly support Simion,&quot; Popescu Zamfir said. Other candidates Georgescu&apos;s electorate may vote for, according to Popescu Zamfir, include former Prime Minister Victor Ponta, former acting President Crin Antonescu, or businessman and politician Gigi Becali. &quot;If Simion does not run, whoever wins the election will have less legitimacy,&quot; Popescu Zamfir said. The ongoing political crisis began last year with Russian meddling in Romania&apos;s elections and the subsequent rise of far-right politicians and their parties. While not making it into the top five according to most opinion polls, Georgescu suddenly took first place following a two-week viral TikTok campaign that involved working with local influencers. The campaign was artificially boosted, with over 66,000 fake TikTok accounts later banned by the platform. Georgescu has been actively promoting conspiracy theories and has been vocally supporting Russia. He called Ukraine a &quot;fictional state&quot; and claimed that the eventual partition of its territories is &quot;inevitable&quot; in an interview published on Jan. 29. The media also found evidence of Georgescu&apos;s links to paramilitary and fascist leaders, such as mercenary Horatiu Potra, who manages a group of soldiers in Congo. On Dec. 8, when the presidential runoff was scheduled to take place, Potra and 20 other people were detained by the police as they were driving to Bucharest carrying weapons and cash. On Feb. 26, the Romanian Prosecutor General&apos;s Office charged Georgescu with &quot;incitement to actions against the constitutional order&quot; and other crimes in a six-count indictment. The charges also included lying about campaign funding and initiating a fascist organization. According to law enforcement, Georgescu used over 1 million euros of undeclared funds and has been involved in neo-legionarism, a Romanian neo-fascist movement that draws its ideology from the country&apos;s Iron Guard militant group active in the run-up to World War II. Georgescu denied any wrongdoing. Supporters of presidential candidate Calin Georgescu cheer outside the Central Electoral Bureau on March 7, 2025 in Bucharest, Romania. (Andrei Pungovschi/Getty Images)On the same day, the Romanian police found dozens of guns, grenades, 25 kilograms of gold, $3.3 million, and 700,000 Romanian Leu ($152,500) in cash in the homes of Potra and his associates. On March 5, Russian military attache Victor Makovskiy and his deputy, Evgeny Ignatiev, were expelled from Romania. The move was connected to Georgescu&apos;s campaign. The next day, six people were arrested for allegedly being part of a military organization attempting to overthrow the government with help from Russia. &quot;These six people are just the visible tip (of the iceberg),&quot; analyst Armand Gosu told Kyiv Independent. &quot;This is the first time Romania openly accuses the Russian Federation of a plot against its state sovereignty.&quot; &quot;They (Russians) can wait years, even decades, that&apos;s why it&apos;s necessary for the Romanian state to neutralize this (entire) network,&quot; Gosu said. According to Popescu Zamfir, &quot;if eliminating the entire network is not possible, at least beheading these groups would avoid further existential threats.&quot; The rise in disinformation and buildup of far-right groups was missed by the government agency set to protect the country from malicious activity from abroad &#x2014; its intelligence. Independent journalist Victor Ilie from the local investigative project Snoop published a series of articles showing how Kremlin-linked creative agencies based in London pump millions of euros to create and promote conspiracy and far-right content in the Romanian digital space. &quot;While Romanians have been mistrustful of Russia, what confuses a part of the Romanian public now is that the U.S., which was considered the country&apos;s main partner, embraced the Russians, and that Georgescu claims that he is not pro-Russian, but pro-American, pro-Trump,&quot; Gosu said. &quot;It&apos;s very hard to explain that the Americans are not what they once were,&quot; he added. &quot;Now Romania is seen as the EU&apos;s weak link that can easily be broken.&quot; However, swift action against Georgescu and his associates showed that Romanian authorities were still eager to fight back. The crisis had also catapulted some new faces that are now set to challenge the far-right at the ballot, among them acting President Ilie Bolojan and Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan, who are gaining popularity.

Ukraine must make concessions in any peace deal, Rubio says	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on March 10 that Ukraine would need to make territorial concessions as part of any agreement to end the war. Speaking while en route to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for discussions with senior Ukrainian officials, Rubio emphasized the necessity of compromise from both Ukraine and Russia, stressing that difficult decisions would be required on both sides. &quot;The most important thing that we have to leave here with is a strong sense that Ukraine is prepared to do difficult things, like the Russians are going to have to do difficult things to end this conflict or at least pause it in some way, shape or form,&quot; he told reporters, according to the New York Times. Rubio&apos;s remarks came just over a week after a tense White House meeting between President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. The meeting resulted in the Trump administration halting military aid to Ukraine due to disagreements over security guarantees in a proposed deal involving Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources. While Rubio did not specify details of a potential agreement, he made it clear that mutual concessions would be key to any diplomatic resolution. Addressing the military situation, Rubio expressed skepticism about a definitive victory for either side. &quot;I think both sides need to come to an understanding that there&#x2019;s no military solution to this situation,&quot; the secretary of state said. &quot;The Russians can&#x2019;t conquer all of Ukraine, and obviously it&#x2019;ll be very difficult for Ukraine in any reasonable time period to sort of force the Russians back all the way to where they were in 2014.&quot; He also noted that determining Russia&#x2019;s willingness to compromise would be a crucial step in future negotiations. Discussions in Jeddah are unlikely to include Trump&#x2019;s earlier proposal, which suggested that U.S. financial interests in Ukrainian natural resources could serve as compensation for American military support. Rubio also clarified that Ukraine&#x2019;s access to Starlink, the satellite internet service provided by Elon Musk&#x2019;s SpaceX, was never under threat. the U.S. still has leverage over Moscow and is attempting to bring Russia to the negotiating table. He also indicated that the resumption of military aid to Ukraine would be a topic of discussion on March 11.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-must-make-concessions-in-any-peace-deal-rubio-says/	2025-03-10T13:55:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203802681.jpg
Ukraine war latest: No threat of encirclement for Ukrainian troops in Russia's Kursk Oblast, Syrskyi says	Key developments on March 10: Ukrainian units are not currently under threat of encirclement in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on March 10. Syrskyi&apos;s statement follows reports on Russian and North Korean troops launching an attack on the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast. Russian forces have made a breakthrough south of the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast, potentially threatening to cut off some of the Ukrainian positions in the Russian region. Russian troops have destroyed Ukrainian troops&apos; logistics in Kursk Oblast, and Ukrainian soldiers face the risk of encirclement, a Ukrainian soldier and a medic deployed in the region told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity on March 7. &quot;There is currently no threat of encirclement of our units in Kursk Oblast. The units are taking timely measures to maneuver to favorable defense lines,&quot; Syrskyi wrote on Facebook. Ukrainian forces &quot;control the situation&quot; on the border between Sumy and Kursk oblasts, according to Syrskyi. Yet, several settlements on the border no longer exist, as they have been destroyed by Russian attacks, he added. Russia has been suffering heavy losses both in personnel and equipment, according to Syrskyi. Near the village of Plekhove, Russian forces lost an infantry battalion in four days of fighting, he said. Ukraine&apos;s commander-in-chief added that he had decided to reinforce Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast with &quot;the necessary forces and means,&quot; including electronic warfare and drones. Concerns about the Ukrainian operation in Kursk Oblast, ongoing since August 2024, have mounted over the weekend amid reports of Russian advances. The development came shortly after the U.S. cut off military and intelligence support for Ukraine, allegedly to push Kyiv to the negotiating table. A potential loss of the Kursk salient or Russian advances in Sumy Oblast would likely weaken Ukraine&apos;s negotiating position as it prepares for initial rounds of talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia. Russian forces are attempting to establish a foothold near Novenke, a Ukrainian village in Sumy Oblast near the border with Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, State Border Guard spokesperson Andrii Demchenko said on air on March 10. The news comes after Russia reportedly achieved a breakthrough in Kursk Oblast, seeking to encircle the Ukrainian forces fighting there and penetrate the Ukrainian border. &quot;These are small assault units, composed of a few people. They try to penetrate our territory, accumulate forces, and advance further into Ukraine, probably to cut off logistical routes,&quot; Demchenko said on national television. Moscow&apos;s troops have been reportedly trying to push toward Novenke, a village lying 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the regional center, Sumy, for several weeks. Ukrainian artillery and drone units continue attacking Russian troops, preventing them from accumulating forces, the spokesperson added. Ukrainian military intelligence&apos;s (HUR) drones struck the Novokuybyshevsk oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Samara Oblast overnight on March 10, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent, confirming earlier reports. The statement came after Russian and Ukrainian sources reported an attack against the facility earlier the same day. Ukraine has systematically targeted Russian oil refineries, military sites, and warehouses deep behind the front lines to undermine Moscow&apos;s capacity to wage its all-out war. The refinery&apos;s &quot;capacity amounts to 8.8 million metric tons of oil per year, making it one of the 10 largest (refineries) in Russia,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. The plant produces gasoline, diesel fuel, and fuel oil, &quot;which are critically important for transport and military equipment,&quot; the official added. This includes jet fuel used by supersonic aircraft such as Su-27 fighter jets and Tu-22 bombers, the HUR source claimed. Samara Oblast residents reported loud explosions overnight, Astra wrote, adding that a fire was recorded at the Rosneft-run oil facility. According to the HUR source, the facility was hit at around 2 a.m. local time. The refinery was not sufficiently protected by anti-drone defenses, the source added. The city of Novokuybyshevsk lies roughly 900 kilometers (560 miles) from the front line in Ukraine. The facility was previously attacked at least twice in March 2024. &quot;This refinery is strategically important for the Russian military as it ensures a stable fuel supply for military operations,&quot; Kovalenko said. The Russian pro-state agency RBC reported a fire at a warehouse in Novokuybyshevsk that covered an area of 1,500 square meters later the same day, without mentioning a drone attack. No casualties were reported. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its forces had shot down nine Ukrainian drones overnight, including three over Samara Oblast, two each over the Voronezh and Oryol oblasts, and one each over the Belgorod and Kursk oblasts. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The Ukrainian delegation will propose a ceasefire in the sky and at sea during the upcoming talks with the U.S. this week on ending the war with Russia, the Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne reported on March 10, citing a Ukrainian official speaking on condition of anonymity. Ukrainian and U.S. delegations will hold talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 to discuss ending the war with Russia. During the meeting, Ukraine will propose a ceasefire at sea and in the sky and a ban on long-range strikes, the source told Suspilne. The official added that such a ceasefire would be &quot;easy to install and to monitor.&quot; The Ukrainian delegation will also insist on releasing prisoners of war and is ready to sign an agreement on mineral resources with the U.S., according to the source. The mineral resource deal was derailed after a spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the White House on Feb. 28. The U.S. delegation, in turn, will insist that Kyiv agree to a partial truce that would enable negotiations to stop the Russian invasion, Bloomberg reported on March 10. Ahead of the meeting in Jeddah, Trump&apos;s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said on March 10 he expects substantial progress in negotiations with Ukraine. &quot;I think that we&apos;re going over there with an expectation that we&apos;re going to make substantial progress,&quot; Witkoff said in an interview with Fox News. When asked about the possible signing of the mineral resource agreement in Saudi Arabia, Witkoff said, &quot;All the signs are very, very positive.&quot; Witkoff also said that the U.S. and Ukraine would discuss territorial issues, security protocols, and intelligence sharing. The Ukrainian president previously announced that his Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa would take part in the talks. The U.S. delegation will be led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Witkoff.The U.S. officials previously met with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. The two sides discussed restoring bilateral relations and held preliminary peace talks without Ukraine&apos;s participation. The U.S. may resume military aid to Ukraine if there is progress during talks with Kyiv in Saudi Arabia this week, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told journalists on March 10 en route to Jeddah, The Guardian reported. &quot;I think the notion of the pause in aid, broadly, is something I hope we can resolve. Obviously, what happens tomorrow will be key to that,&quot; Rubio said. Following President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s clash with U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, Washington suspended all military aid to Ukraine. CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed on March 5 that the U.S. had also halted intelligence sharing, potentially limiting Ukraine&apos;s ability to detect Russian missile strikes and carry out long-range attacks. Speaking about a potential truce, Rubio praised Ukraine&apos;s proposal for a ceasefire in the sky and at sea. &quot;I&apos;m not saying that alone is enough, but it&apos;s the kind of concession you would need to see in order to end the conflict,&quot; he said. Rubio also said that more details still needed to &quot;be worked out&quot; on the mineral resource deal between Ukraine and the U.S. The deal was derailed after the clash between Zelensky and Trump on Feb. 28. Neither Ukraine nor Russia &quot;has the cards&quot; in potential peace negotiations, U.S. President Donald Trump told journalists on March 10 ahead of talks between the U.S. and Ukraine in Saudi Arabia. The Ukrainian and U.S. delegations are to hold talks on March 11 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on ending Russia&apos;s war. The participants are expected to discuss potential ceasefire options and a mineral resource deal between the U.S. and Ukraine. &quot;I say they (Ukraine) don&apos;t have the cards. Nobody really has the cards. Russia doesn&apos;t have the cards. What you have to do is you have to make a deal, and you have to stop the killing. It&apos;s a senseless war, and we are going to get it stopped,&quot; Trump said. Trump&apos;s recent statement contradicts his previous ones, in which he claimed the opposite about Ukraine and Russia. On Feb. 20, Trump said that Russia held &quot;the cards&quot; in any peace talks with Ukraine as they occupy a significant part of Ukrainian territory. Eight days later, the U.S. president told his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, during a heated argument in the White House that he &quot;was not in a good position&quot; regarding the war and did not have &quot;the right cards.&quot; Following the spat in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, the U.S. suspended its military and intelligence aid for Ukraine. The Ukrainian delegation is expected to discuss the resumption of military aid in Saudi Arabia. The delegations will also discuss territorial issues, security protocols, and intelligence sharing, according to Trump&apos;s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff.

We're ready' — Ukraine heads into US peace talks with everything at stake	Kyiv officials will meet their Washington counterparts in Jeddah on March 11 for talks which will impact the future of diplomatic relations between the two countries and likely the future of the war in Ukraine. The Ukrainian side hopes the meeting would help mend ties with the White House and ensure that the future U.S.-led peace process doesn&apos;t pose an existential threat to Ukraine. &quot;The advice for Ukraine is just get yourself aligned with the United States,&quot; Ambassador Kurt Volker, who served as the U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations in 2017-2019 and U.S. ambassador to NATO in 2008-2009, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;This pushback on the U.S&#x2026; is counterproductive,&quot; Volker said. The alignment, however, doesn&apos;t seem an easy task, as the U.S. administration has been publicly attacking Ukraine, calling its leader a dictator, and cutting off vital intelligence sharing that may derail Kyiv&apos;s ability to defend itself. In Jeddah, top of the agenda will likely be the critical minerals deal, the signing of which stalled last month following the disastrous meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. Ukraine is still paying the price for what the Trump administration has tried to paint as Zelensky&apos;s unwillingness to engage in peace negotiations and Ukraine&apos;s lack of gratitude for U.S. military aid, which it froze a few days after the White House meeting. Kyiv is entering the talks with a weak hand but is prepared to do what it needs to to get the U.S. back on its side. &quot;We&apos;re ready,&quot; a source in the President&apos;s Office told the Kyiv Independent when asked about the prospect of signing the mineral deal. In an effort to convince the U.S. that Ukraine is serious about peace and in the hope that Washington will resume military aid and intelligence sharing, Kyiv is also reportedly proposing a partial ceasefire covering long-range drone and missile strikes, as well as hostilities in the Black Sea. The U.S., however, may now want to extort more from a weakened Ukraine. Having to offer so much to the U.S. before peace talks with Russia can begin in earnest is being keenly felt in Kyiv. When asked what Ukraine was expecting at the talks in Jeddah, the source in the President&apos;s Office replied: &quot;Finally hearing what the Americans want from the negotiations.&quot; Despite arriving in Saudi Arabia on March 10 for a meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Zelensky won&apos;t be part of Ukraine&apos;s official delegation, which will instead by led by his closest aide Andriy Yermak. Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Colonel Pavlo Palisa make up the rest of the team. The U.S. delegation includes Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, and Trump&apos;s special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff. Even if Ukraine can get the U.S. back onside, the negotiations to end the war are still ahead, and Trump&apos;s rhetoric portends anything but an easy path. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy looks on as he arrives at the Special European Council in Brussels on March 6, 2025, to discuss support for Ukraine and European defense. (Nicolas Tucat / AFP via Getty Images)&quot;So many of the things that Trump has said in the last two or three days give you the impression that he thinks Ukraine was going to lose regardless, that the Biden administration wasted a lot of money prolonging (the war), and we just have to get that over with,&quot; Volker said. Nothing that has come out of the White House in recent weeks suggests Trump has any interest in reaching a peace agreement that is in Ukraine&apos;s interests. After Polish President Andrzej Duda said that Ukraine would not survive without U.S. support, Trump was asked in an interview on March 9 if he was &quot;comfortable&quot; with the thought of his actions potentially leading to the destruction of the country. &quot;Well, it may not survive anyway,&quot; Trump said. His assessment of Ukraine&apos;s future came around a month after he flippantly suggested the country &quot;may be Russian someday&quot; in comments that made clear his main interest lay in Kyiv&apos;s mineral wealth and the ability to pay back U.S. military aid. Trump&apos;s transactional approach to negotiations that appear to have little regard for Ukrainian lives, territory, or sovereignty is a major source of concern in Kyiv, and the country as a whole. &quot;The expectations (of the Jeddah meeting) are alarming,&quot; Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, lawmaker from the Holos party, chairman of the parliamentary committee on freedom of speech, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Because recently the U.S. administration has demonstrated a desire not for just peace, but for the fastest possible reconciliation between the victim and the aggressor, without taking into account the interests of the victim.&quot; Yurchyshyn acknowledged that an &quot;optimistic&quot; outcome for the talks would simply be to get relations back on track and for the U.S. to &quot;take into account the interests of Ukraine in the future negotiation process.&quot; But another unavoidable fact of the U.S.-led peace negotiations so far is that Washington has not yet had to truly negotiate with Russia. The much-vaunted first round of talks between Washington and Moscow on Feb. 18 produced little of actual substance &#x2014; restoring embassy staffing for further diplomatic missions, appointing representatives to further the negotiation process, and creating the necessary conditions for restarting U.S.-Russia relations. While repeatedly strong-arming Ukraine into proving it is serious about peace, the White House has said nothing so far about how it plans to make Russian President Vladimir Putin order his armed forces to put down their guns. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to journalists aboard Air Force One while traveling from West Palm Beach to Washington, U.S. on March 9, 2025. (Roberto Schmidt / AFP via Getty Images)&quot;I hope that Trump&apos;s team will explain to our delegation whether or not President Trump has a strategy or a plan with regard to Ukraine and Russian aggression against Ukraine,&quot; Oleksandr Merezhko, the chair of the parliament&apos;s foreign affairs committee, said. What form this plan may take and what concessions the U.S. demands of Russia remain to be seen, but after yet another mass missile attack on Ukrainian cities last week, &quot;Trump&apos;s rage has been intensifying,&quot; Axios reported on March 7, citing an unnamed White House official. Yet on the same day, Trump still stated he found it &quot;more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine&quot; than Russia, something Volker believes could soon change, saying his statement shows he has a &quot;really misguided set of assumptions about what&apos;s happening.&quot; &quot;I think he has some kind of belief that Putin has limited and reasonable demands, which is not the case,&quot; he said. &quot;Putin has unlimited demands, starting with Ukraine, that they should be part of Russia, but then even beyond Ukraine. And I think (Trump) doesn&apos;t quite believe that, at least not yet.&quot; Meanwhile, watching from the sidelines is Europe, so far excluded from peace negotiations despite being the very continent upon which the war is being waged. Until that changes, Brussels faces much the same challenges as Kyiv &#x2014; convincing Trump that Ukraine&apos;s interests need to be considered. &quot;We have reiterated at all levels precisely that it is in Ukraine&apos;s interest, in Europe&apos;s interest, and ultimately also in the U.S. interest to put Ukraine in a position of strength before entering into peace negotiations,&quot; Paula Pinho, chief spokesperson of the European Commission, told the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/were-ready-ukraine-heads-into-us-talks-with-everything-at-stake/	2025-03-10T12:46:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203792484.jpg
US military aid freeze could be 'resolved' during talks with Ukraine this week, Rubio says	The U.S. may resume military aid to Ukraine if there is progress during talks with Kyiv in Saudi Arabia this week, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told journalists on March 10 en route to Jeddah, The Guardian reported. Ukrainian and U.S. delegations are set to meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 to discuss a potential ceasefire or peace agreement with Russia and a mineral resource deal between Kyiv and Washington. &quot;I think the notion of the pause in aid, broadly, is something I hope we can resolve.

US, Ukraine charities see surge in donations after Trump’s attacks – but stress this doesn’t fill the void	For members of the U.S.-based charity organization Razom for Ukraine, U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s Feb. 28 verbal assault on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky felt like &#x201C;a punch to the gut,&#x201D; as it undermined years of the country&#x2019;s diplomatic support for Ukraine in its ongoing fight against Russian aggression. &#x201C;We weren&#x2019;t alone in this feeling, though &#x2014; soon after, we received an influx of donations from thousands of Americans who were disappointed by the outcome of the meeting,&#x201D; Anastasia Rab, chief advancement officer for Razom, told the Kyiv Independent. In the wake of the confrontation, the Trump administration took unprecedented actions, including suspending military aid and curtailing intelligence sharing, which directly threatens Ukraine&apos;s ability to defend itself. Meanwhile, Trump&#x2019;s attacks on Zelensky seemed to shift blame for the war&#x2019;s duration from Russia to Ukraine itself, further exacerbating tensions. Despite these challenges, volunteer organizations on both sides of the Atlantic are seeing a slight increase in support, as Americans and Ukrainians alike, disheartened by the political setbacks, are more determined than ever to show their solidarity with Ukraine&#x2019;s effort. But these volunteer organizations can only do so much, they stress. Razom for Ukraine was founded in 2014 after the EuroMaidan Revolution and Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, witnessing firsthand the harsh realities of the ongoing war and its toll on Ukrainian civilians and soldiers alike. In the lead-up to Trump&#x2019;s inauguration in January, Razom&#x2019;s members felt what they described as a &#x201C;deep sense of duty and responsibility&#x201D; to step up to the challenges his presidency might present, with donations just one part of their broader effort. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve been working with politicians, press, and constituents on both sides of the (political) aisle to ensure that support for Ukraine continues to be bipartisan, and people have the information and support they need to craft good Ukraine policy,&#x201D; Rab said. Unlike many other organizations, Razom for Ukraine was not impacted by the recent U.S. government cuts to USAID (the United States Agency for International Development). Their nationwide donor base has allowed them to continue carrying out their mission. However, some of the 200 Ukraine-based organizations supported by Razom&apos;s Relief Fund &#x2014; which has helped over one million civilians by providing food, shelter, clean water, psychological support, and other necessities during the full-scale war &#x2014; were impacted by Trump&apos;s freeze on foreign assistance, hindering their work. According to Razom&#x2019;s website, they&#x2019;ve earmarked an additional $1.8 million in funds to make sure that these affiliated organizations are able to continue helping Ukrainian civilians impacted directly by the war. While Razom says it has experienced an uptick in donations from across the U.S. and is on track to meet its fundraising goals ahead of schedule, the organization emphasizes that there are still limits to what they can do. &#x201C;&#x200B;&#x200B;People are clearly stepping up and we&#x2019;re grateful for that engagement, but it&#x2019;s really important to note that this engagement can&#x2019;t compensate for the cut-off in military aid, financial aid, and intelligence sharing of the U.S.,&#x201D; Rab said. Many Americans have been watching the latest events unfold with the understanding that supporting Ukraine is not just an act of solidarity &#x2014; it&#x2019;s more critical than ever. &#x201C;Russia won&apos;t back down, if anything I fear things will continue getting worse. Without U.S. military funding or weapons, I fear the worst is yet to come,&#x201D; Emma Atul, who has spent summers in Ukraine as a volunteer English teacher, told the Kyiv Independent. Though between jobs and unable to donate as often as she&#x2019;d like, she remains committed to promoting the Ukrainian culture she&#x2019;s experienced firsthand and she says that Razom for Ukraine is always a reliable choice for her when it comes to where to donate &#x2014; even a small sum feels like she&apos;s making a difference. &#x201C;The least we as Americans can do is donate to charities and continue writing to our representatives. I may not be Ukrainian or have Ukrainian relatives but Ukraine has a special place in my heart.&#x201D; In Ukraine, where nearly everyone has lost someone to the war or has a loved one fighting on the front line, the latest news from the U.S. has been met with a quiet stoicism &#x2014; a familiar response, though still one that is never easy to bear. The priority of volunteer organizations on the ground in Ukraine remains largely unchanged &#x2014; no matter what happens, they continue to search for ways to help soldiers on the front lines and ease the suffering of civilians. Founded in 2014, Come Back Alive is one of Ukraine&#x2019;s largest and most vital wartime aid organizations, primarily tasked with purchasing weapons and other necessary equipment for the military. However, since 2022, the organization has also been investing in training for the Ukrainian army. &#x201C;This helps to efficiently use the material resources the army already has, as well as to save lives,&#x201D; Head of Partnerships Oleksandra Haivoronska told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;All these years, and not only in times of crisis, we have been trying to work to the fullest and build capacity. That&apos;s why we still evaluate all our projects from the standpoint of &#x2018;What does it give the country?&#x2019; and &#x2018;What does it change on the battlefield?&#x2019;&#x201D; The organization allows the public to track donations on its website. Donations from foreign supporters in particular saw a modest uptick following Zelensky&#x2019;s contentious visit to the White House at the end of February, according to Haivoronska. In the first two months of 2025, Come Back Alive received more than 363,000 donations totaling Hr 545.4 million ($13 million) &#x2014; an increase from the same period last year, when the organization collected Hr 452.6 million ($11 million) from 163,000 donations. The listed currencies of the donations include not only hryvnias but euros and dollars, indicating a global donor base. While some volunteer organizations in Ukraine rely more on grants than donations, they are closely monitoring the shifting dynamics of U.S. support. The Ukrainian Charity Alliance, founded in Kharkiv in 2018, focuses on aiding the most vulnerable groups in Ukrainian society through education, healthcare, social protection, legal assistance, and psychological support. Going into 2025, the organization proactively began strengthening its operational strategies to ensure readiness for the challenges the coming months may bring. &#x201C;We have a plan. We are currently working on a new fundraising strategy, which will be focused on raising funds abroad. We have established a board of trustees and are selecting ambassadors from other countries who will help us with this,&#x201D; Oleksii Kurtsev, director of the organization, told the Kyiv Independent. Though the Ukrainian Charity Alliance was not directly affected by USAID cuts, its team remains &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about the precedent set by the Trump administration&apos;s recent actions, which suggest that international law has faltered and power is now the dominant force in resolving conflicts. &#x201C;We can no longer rely on anyone but ourselves and our trusted partners, with whom we have been working for over three years to bring our shared victory closer,&#x201D; Kurtsev said. &#x201C;A strong global civil society has the power to challenge governments that prioritize only their own interests.&#x201D; Hi there, thanks for reading my latest article. As an American living in Ukraine for many years, it meant a lot to me to see that many of my fellow countrymen were as outraged by Trump&apos;s recent policy turns as I was. Supporting Ukraine is more important than ever, and that includes supporting charities, like the ones I wrote about here.

Ukraine to propose ceasefire at sea, in sky during talks with US this week, media outlet reports	The Ukrainian delegation will propose a ceasefire in the sky and at sea during the upcoming talks with the U.S. this week on ending the war with Russia, the Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne reported on March 10, citing a Ukrainian official speaking on condition of anonymity. Ukrainian and U.S. delegations will hold talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 to discuss ending the war with Russia.

No threat of encirclement for Ukrainian troops in Russia's Kursk Oblast, Syrskyi says	Ukrainian units are not currently under threat of encirclement in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on March 10. Syrskyi&apos;s statement follows reports on Russian and North Korean troops launching an attack on the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast. Russian forces have made a breakthrough south of the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast, potentially threatening to cut off some of the Ukrainian positions in the Russian region. Russian troops have destroyed Ukrainian troops&apos; logistics in Kursk Oblast, and Ukrainian soldiers face the risk of encirclement, a Ukrainian soldier and a medic deployed in the region told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity on March 7. &quot;There is currently no threat of encirclement of our units in Kursk Oblast. The units are taking timely measures to maneuver to favorable defense lines,&quot; Syrskyi wrote on Facebook. Ukrainian forces &quot;control the situation&quot; on the border between Sumy and Kursk oblasts, according to Syrskyi. Yet, several settlements on the border no longer exist, as they have been destroyed by Russian attacks, he added. Russia has been suffering heavy losses both in personnel and equipment, according to Syrskyi. Near the village of Plekhove, Russian forces lost an infantry battalion in four days of fighting, he said. Ukraine&apos;s commander-in-chief added that he had decided to reinforce Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast with &quot;the necessary forces and means,&quot; including electronic warfare and drones. Concerns about the Ukrainian operation in Kursk Oblast, ongoing since August 2024, have mounted over the weekend amid reports of Russian advances. The development came shortly after the U.S. cut off military and intelligence support for Ukraine, allegedly to push Kyiv to the negotiating table. A potential loss of the Kursk salient or Russian advances in Sumy Oblast would likely weaken Ukraine&apos;s negotiating position as it prepares for initial rounds of talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia.	https://kyivindependent.com/there-is-currently-no-threat-of-encirclement-of-ukrainian-units-in-russias-kursk-oblast-syrskyi-says/	2025-03-10T09:19:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2180021122.jpg
Zelensky arrives in Saudi Arabia ahead of Ukraine-US talks	President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 10 to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, The Guardian reported.Zelensky initially intended to visit Saudi Arabia as part of a Middle East tour in February but delayed the trip due to bilateral U.S.-Russian talks in Riyadh on Feb. 18. The Gulf countries have traditionally played the role of mediators between Russia and Ukraine, namely in regard to prisoner exchanges. Following Zelensky&apos;s meeting with the Saudi crown prince, the Ukrainian president&apos;s team will remain in the country on March 11 to meet U.S. delegates and discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement. Zelensky is not expected to participate in the negotiations. Zelensky previously announced that his Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Zelensky&apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff Pavlo Palisa would take part in the talks.The meeting between the U.S. and Ukrainian delegations will occur after a heated argument between Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance on Feb. 28 in the White House Oval Office.Since that meeting, the U.S. has ended its military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-arrives-in-saudi-arabia-ahead-of-ukraine-us-talks/	2025-03-10T08:30:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156503093.jpg
Navigating the world of Trump and Musk's lies	Just a few years ago, the biggest purveyors of disinformation on the internet were bots, conspiracy theorists and Russian propaganda outlets. Today the world is a very different place and two of the most prominent sources of lies and mistruths are the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and the world&#x2019;s richest man, Elon Musk. The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Chris York sits down with Eliot Higgins, founder and creative director of the investigative outlet Bellingcat, to discuss how we arrived at this point and what can be done about it.	https://kyivindependent.com/navigating-the-world-of-trump-and-musks-lies/	2025-03-10T08:27:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_1275.JPG
Washington considers easing sanctions on Russian oil, Bloomberg reports	Advisers to U.S. President Donald Trump are discussing easing sanctions against Russia, including those imposed on Russian oil, a major source of funding for the war in Ukraine, Bloomberg reported on March 10, citing sources. The news comes as Ukraine and the U.S. are set to hold talks on ending Russia&apos;s war in Saudi Arabia this week. The Trump administration is seeking options to make &quot;a step forward&quot; and encourage the Kremlin to negotiate an end to the war. Easing the price ceiling on Russian oil is allegedly one option under consideration, Bloomberg reported, citing its undisclosed sources familiar with the matter. The oil price cap was approved by G7 countries in 2022 and came into effect in 2023. Currently the cap stands at $60 per barrel. Despite Russia&apos;s ability to sustain a wartime economy through increased military spending and industrial production, experts say it remains vulnerable and needs sanctions relief. The Kremlin has expressed interest in economic cooperation with the U.S., particularly in rare earth metals. Trump has also sought a minerals deal with Ukraine, which has significant lithium and rare earth metal reserves, as a way to offset the billions of dollars in American aid. However, his meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28 ended without an agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/washington-considers-easing-sanctions-over-russian-oil-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-10T08:03:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1258888534.jpeg
Russian woman seeks to adopt abducted Ukrainian child after her son was killed fighting in war, investigation says	A Russian woman, Olga Dorokhina, took a 4-year-old girl from the occupied part of Kherson Oblast and plans to adopt her, according to an investigation by Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne published on March 10. Dorokhina&#x2019;s son was previously killed while fighting against Ukraine, according to the investigation. Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, at least 19,500 Ukrainian children have been abducted from occupied territories and transferred to other Russian-controlled areas, Belarus, or Russia itself, according to Ukraine&#x2019;s national database, Children of War. Dorokhina spoke about her trip and the girl&#x2019;s abduction from Ukraine during a conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin at an event, claiming she had &quot;found her daughter&quot; in Kherson Oblast. The child is now under her guardianship. Suspilne&#x2019;s investigative team identified Dorokhina as a native of Yelets, Lipetsk Oblast, Russia, who moved to occupied Simferopol in Crimea in 2016. Her husband, Oleksandr Dorokhin, is a former employee of Russia&#x2019;s Federal Penitentiary Service and a veteran of the Chechen war. Her eldest son, Vladislav Dorokhin, served in Russia&#x2019;s Black Sea Fleet before joining the 810th Marine Brigade to fight in Ukraine, Suspilne reported. Ukraine has so far managed to return 1,240 abducted children, according to the Children of War database. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Putin and Children&#x2019;s Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova over their involvement in the unlawful transfer of Ukrainian children. Human rights groups have said that Russia&apos;s mass abductions of Ukrainian civilians, including children, may constitute a war crime and a crime against humanity.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-woman-seeks-to-adopt-abducted-ukrainian-child-as-her-son-was-killed-fighting-in-war/	2025-03-10T07:20:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1246326347.jpg
US hasn't stopped sharing defense-related intelligence with Ukraine, Trump's envoy says	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. The U.S. has never stopped sharing intelligence with Ukraine that is needed for defensive purposes, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, told Fox News on March 10. The comments seem to confirm earlier claims in the media that the U.S. freeze on intelligence sharing with Kyiv, instituted on March 5, did not extend to information needed for defense operations. Restrictions on intelligence that could help Ukraine strike Russian targets remain in place, according to the latest information. The issue will be discussed at the U.S.-Ukrainian talks in Jeddah on March 11, Witkoff said before departing for Saudi Arabia. The Trump administration restricted intelligence sharing with Ukraine shortly after freezing all U.S. military assistance flowing to the country, which has faced Russia&apos;s all-out war for more than three years. The steps followed a heated exchange between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House on Feb. 28, which underscored Washington&apos;s increasingly hostile stance toward Ukraine as it seeks to restore ties with Russia. According to Witkoff, the U.S. hopes for significant progress with Ukraine this week, which could include the signing of a natural resources deal that has been on hold since the Oval Office spat.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-hasnt-stopped-sharing-defense-related-intelligence-with-ukraine-trumps-envoy-says/	2025-03-10T06:49:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203659271.jpg
Do US-Russia talks on Ukraine mark a reappearance of colonial power play?	The unexpected negotiations between the United States and the Russian Federation that began in Saudi Arabia in February were strange. These off-line discussions in Riyadh, which included foreign ministers and presidential advisors from both countries, focused primarily on the fate of Ukraine and the future of European security. Yet, neither Ukraine nor the European Union, nor any of its member states, were present or in any other way involved in these purely bilateral face-to-face meetings. Other oddities were apparent. A Ukrainian delegation, led by First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, had just met with Saudi Arabian officials in Riyadh on Feb. 16. This delegation was there to prepare for a visit by President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was on a previously planned trip to the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia &#x2014; although the Saudi portion was canceled. Ukraine&#x2019;s president and government officials were physically nearby the American and Russian negotiators, who were discussing the future of the Ukrainian state in Riyadh. The absurdity of this situation in February illustrates the profound changes the international order may be undergoing today. The approaches of Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s inner circle and the Trump administration to Ukraine do not signal a new &quot;multipolar world.&quot; Instead, they reflect a return to the principles of the Yalta system, established during the final months of World War II. The idea of &quot;might makes right&quot; that, in spite of the Allies&#x2019; triumph over the fascist axis, prevailed in 1945 seems to resurface today, as outside powers attempt to divide continental Europe. During talks at Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam in 1943-45, Moscow was granted more East European territory than it had received before and at the start of World War II, in its talks with Nazi Germany. In protocols to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and German-Soviet Border and Friendship Treaty of 1939, Stalin had secured Soviet control over parts of East-Central Europe, including Poland and the Baltic states. But by 1945, the U.S. had handed over the entire eastern portion of the continent to Soviet imperialism, enforced Russification, state terrorism, and colonial exploitation. To show his disrespect for the new international system established in 1945, Stalin smuggled the Soviet &quot;republics&quot; of Ukraine and Belarus as founding members into the United Nations. After the collapse of the German empire in 1945, other European empires, too, lost most of their colonies. By 1989-1991, it seemed that the Russian land empire, in its communist form, had also come to an end. First, the nations of the Soviet bloc or &quot;outer empire,&quot; and then the republics of the Soviet Union&#x2019;s &quot;inner empire,&quot; gained formal independence. However, Moscow&#x2019;s 1945-1991 mockery of international law continued, albeit on a smaller scale, after the breakup of the Soviet Union. For example, without following the regular process of application and accession to the United Nations (as Serbia did after the breakup of Yugoslavia), Russia became a permanent member of the UN Security Council, even though the UN&#x2019;s statute still only mentions the Soviet Union. The Kremlin also managed to gain Western sanctioning for so-called &#x201C;peacekeepers&#x201D; in Moldova and Georgia, whose role was to &quot;keep pieces&quot; of a Russian rump-empire under Moscow&#x2019;s control. For 30 years after 1991, both the U.S. and Western Europe practiced a &quot;Russia First&quot; policy, where the interests of Russia&#x2019;s former colonies were secondary to those of Moscow. This strange policy even meant temporarily expanding the G7 to include Russia, creating a G8 group, which &#x2014; at least in the Kremlin&#x2019;s understanding &#x2014; reinforced Moscow&#x2019;s continued status as a world and imperial power. The most scandalous example of this approach was the (abortive) Russo-German Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project launched after, and in demonstrative disregard of, Russia&#x2019;s annexation of Crimea and covert military intervention in Eastern Ukraine in 2014. (L-R) Then-French Prime Minister Francois Fillon, then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel, then-Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, and then-European Union Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger turn a wheel to symbolically start the flow of gas through the Nord Stream Baltic Sea gas pipeline at a ceremony in Lubmin, Germany, on Nov. 8, 2011. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)In 2022, Germany and other Western European nations finally reversed their &quot;Russia First&quot; stance, finally recognizing the legitimacy and rationality of the interests of Moscow&#x2019;s former colonies. Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia&#x2014;though still partially occupied&#x2014;became candidates for membership in the European Union. The driving force behind this shift was Ursula von der Leyen, the German president of the European Commission, representing a nation that once had its own colonial plans for Ukraine. In contrast, the U.S., which itself began the decolonization process in the 18th century, seems to be today reversing its earlier liberationist stance toward Eastern Europe and its active support for Russia&#x2019;s former colonies breaking free from Moscow&#x2019;s neo-imperial orbit. At least rhetorically, the Trump administration appears to be returning to a Yalta-like approach, where the voices of smaller states are sidelined, and Ukraine&#x2019;s participation in negotiations about its future is unnecessary. Much of this occurs in direct or indirect contradiction to the letter and spirit of the 30-year old security assurances Washington gave Kyiv in the now infamous Budapest Memorandum. In December 1994, this historic document was signed in by Kyiv and the three depositary governments of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), i.e. the U.S., United Kingdom, and Russia in connection with Ukraine&#x2019;s decision to relinquish all of its Soviet-era atomic weapons and sign the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon state. Trump&#x2019;s stance also conflicts with the 2008 Bucharest NATO declaration, in which U.S. President George W. Bush entrenched a NATO membership perspective for Ukraine and Georgia, as well as with the 2008 Strategic Partnership Charter and 2024 Bilateral Security Agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine. Time will tell how far this American reversal of its foreign affairs and thus of the overall course of contemporary world history will go.

Russia moves to curb Chinese car imports with higher fees, tighter regulations	Russia is moving to curb the flow of Chinese car imports, a decision that could deal a blow to Chinese manufacturers and traders who have increasingly relied on the Russian market, the Financial Times reported on March 10. China has remained a key economic partner for Russia throughout the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, supplying Moscow with critical dual-use goods and helping to keep its economy afloat amind Western sanctions. Chinese car exports to Russia surged sevenfold in 2023 compared to 2022, as Western sanctions over Moscow&#x2019;s war against Ukraine cut Russia off from brands like Volkswagen, Toyota, and BMW. Automakers in China, facing anti-dumping measures in the U.S., EU, Canada, Turkey, and Brazil, found a lucrative market in Russia, the Financial Times wrote. Chinese brands now account for 63% of the market, while domestic Russian brands have fallen to 29%. In response, Russian authorities have introduced measures to slow the influx. In January, Moscow raised the &quot;recycling fees&quot; for most passenger cars to $7,500, more than doubling the rate set last September. The fees will continue rising by 10-20% annually until 2030. Russian regulators have also blocked the sale of a Chinese truck model over alleged safety violations and warned that more compliance checks may follow. The move comes amid an expected decline in new car sales in Russia, with projections of a 30% drop in 2025 if high interest rates persist, according to Avtovaz CEO Maxim Sokolov. The state-owned Avtovaz is Russia&apos;s largest carmaker, known for its flagship Lada vehicle series. The Russian Central Bank raised its key interest rate to 21% in October 2024 to curb inflation from wartime spending. Despite its growing economic ties with Russia, Beijing insists it remains neutral in Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine and has even sought to position itself as a mediator.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-moves-to-curb-chinese-car-imports-with-higher-fees-tighter-regulations/	2025-03-10T06:23:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-164317197.jpg
5 steps for securing an eastward enlargement of the European Union	Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine is not only about Ukraine&#x2019;s freedom and survival, but also about the future of Europe&#x2019;s hard security. Russia wants to replace the cooperative, democratic security order in Europe, the principles of which were outlined 50 years ago in the Helsinki Final Act, with one where might makes right and Russia is an empire dominating large swathes of Europe. This would pose an existential security threat to the European Union and its member states. The EU&#x2019;s decision to open accession negotiations with Ukraine is a geostrategic investment that could strengthen the European security order and prevent Russia from achieving its ambitions. It does so not only by defending Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereign right to pursue a European path, but also by securing military capabilities and strategic resources for the EU. However, even though Ukraine could contribute to the EU&#x2019;s security in the long term as a full member, it is primarily Europe that must ensure Ukraine&#x2019;s security. NATO membership remains Ukraine&#x2019;s goal &#x2014; it is enshrined in the constitution and supported by a clear majority of Ukrainian citizens. However, there is currently no consensus within NATO on extending an invitation to Ukraine. This could change quickly, and European countries are right to insist that Ukrainian NATO membership would be the best and cheapest option for ensuring security in the North Atlantic area. Nonetheless, the prospects for Ukrainian NATO membership remain distant, so the EU must seriously consider how it can secure its geostrategic investment &#x2014; an EU eastward enlargement &#x2014; without security guarantees under NATO&#x2019;s Article 5. The EU may also face fundamentally new and urgent military challenges in light of U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s expressed ambition to reach a ceasefire deal in Russia&#x2019;s war. While the form of such a deal and the prospects for reaching it are far from certain, any form of ceasefire settlement would need to be followed by credible security assurances to Ukraine. Without this, Ukraine would be defenseless against renewed Russian aggression (as happened after the conclusion of the Minsk agreements). The possibility that EU member states and countries like the U.K. and Norway would have to deploy troops on Ukrainian territory in the case of a ceasefire deal cannot be ruled out. Against this backdrop, the need to step up the EU&#x2019;s hard security is not a distant task that needs to be realized only after Ukraine joins the EU. To secure an eastward EU enlargement and address potentially immediate military challenges, the EU must deliver on its ambition to become a geostrategic actor, both on its own and in close cooperation with NATO. It must show, through deeds, that it has both the political resolve and the capabilities to defend itself and its core interests. Some of the measures needed to achieve that ambition will require deviations from the status quo and reassessments of the EU&#x2019;s role. The feasibility of implementing the required steps to ensure the EU&#x2019;s hard security will not only stem from political desire in European capitals, but also from external circumstances and pressure from the U.S. These factors may provide the sense of necessity that, as in the past, enables EU member states to unite, shape, and reshape European cooperation. First, European policymakers should consider implementing key institutional reforms in foreign and security policy. Currently, the EU&#x2019;s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) remains intergovernmental; since decisions require consensus among member states, EU action can suffer from a lack of timeliness and effectiveness. A move to qualified majority voting (QMV) in the CFSP would enhance the EU&#x2019;s policymaking efficiency and could arguably be done without a Treaty change. QMV has been discussed in the past, but today&#x2019;s geopolitical challenges could provide the impetus to move ahead with it.

(Maxym Marusenko / NurPhoto via Getty Images)The CFSP is also an area that Ukraine and Moldova could be integrated into immediately, for example, by allowing them to participate in key CFSP decision-making forums and by integrating them into EU security initiatives such as the European Defence Agency (EDA) and Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO). Second, the EU&#x2019;s enhanced geostrategic role will require large-scale investments and efforts in security and defense. Defense spending in member states would need to exceed at least 3% of GDP, a significant portion of which would be devoted to military assistance to Ukraine and investments in the Ukrainian defense industry. The European Council conclusions on European defense from March 6 welcomed the European Commission&#x2019;s plans to facilitate increased national defense spending and provide member states with defense loans. They also called on the European Investment Bank (EIB) to adapt its lending practices to the defense industry, re-evaluate the list of excluded activities and increase the volume of available funding. These conclusions outline necessary steps in the right direction. Taking on EU common debt through defense bonds could also offer financial firepower for closing capability gaps and strengthening Europe&#x2019;s defense infrastructure. For such a step to be viable, countries that have traditionally opposed joint debt would need to change their frugal positions. Third, if the EU is to succeed in taking on a new role in world politics, European leaders must improve their strategic communication with citizens. A change in strategic culture in Europe &#x2014; based on an understanding among citizens of, for example, why enlargement is a geostrategic investment, why enlargement needs security, and the urgent military challenges the EU might face &#x2014; will be key to ensuring domestic support for investments in security and defense. Strategic communication with the citizens of EU member states about the concrete contributions that candidate countries can make to the EU&#x2019;s security and economic prosperity as full member states will also play an important role. Fourth, greater and closer cooperation between the EU and NATO will be necessary to ensure effective complementarity and intelligence sharing between the two organizations. One step could be sealing a new partnership between the EU and NATO, under which the EU would use its financial and regulatory tools to help member states fulfill NATO capability requirements and enforce more strictly defined NATO standardization agreements for equipment and ammunition to enhance interoperability. Trilateral exchanges between the EU, NATO, and groups of EU member states on creating military mobility corridors and consolidating multinational military logistics would further strengthen cooperation and could be proactively suggested to the U.S. by European states. Fifth, bearing in mind the possibility of a military operation on Ukrainian territory, European states should ensure they create the structures necessary for its implementation. There is a need to establish a joint military command, along with various staff structures, responsible for planning both the operation itself and potential reinforcements for deployed troops in the event of a crisis. Additionally, logistics and intelligence structures will need to be set up, and the military units that could participate must be identified. Ideally, these would be multinational formations already established within the framework of NATO&#x2019;s joint command in Europe, such as the Multinational Corps Northeast. The question of possible independent military operations by European NATO members, without the participation of the U.S., has arisen several times in NATO&#x2019;s history. These ideas have traditionally been rejected by Washington, partly because of concerns that an increasingly autonomous Europe would undermine U.S. authority in NATO, duplicate NATO resources, and threaten NATO cohesion. If Washington is shifting its approach to Europe&apos;s security, now may be the right time to revisit the idea of establishing European cells within NATO. This would allow Europe to take on the primary responsibility for ensuring Ukraine&#x2019;s (and Europe&#x2019;s) security, while maintaining critical U.S. support within NATO for logistics, airlift, and strategic reconnaissance.

Investigation: We tried to buy American chips as a Russian defense manufacturer — and it worked	Despite bans put in place by the U.S. and Europe on the supply of electronic components to Russia, dozens of Russian microelectronics suppliers continue to obtain and resell imported chips to Russian arms manufacturers successfully. Without these Western chips, Russia would not be able to produce key weapons &#x2014; like missiles, drones, and self-propelled howitzers. To prove that this line of supply continues to operate three years into Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, the Kyiv Independent tried ordering American microchips from Russian trading companies, posing as a Russian defense producer. We obtained a list of Russian firms supplying Western microcircuits to the Russian defense industry from leaked emails of the Russian state holding Ruselectronics. The Kyiv Independent obtained access to the leak together with OCCRP. (The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s first investigation based on the leak is available here. The investigation focused on the continued export of Russian weapons during the full-scale war.) We combed through the emails for mentions of the supply of American and European chips to Russia and followed the traces of the described transactions. According to the leaked letters, after the start of the full-scale invasion, companies of the Ruselectronics holding requested large volumes of various American and European chips from Russian suppliers &#x2014; and got confirmation that they could be supplied, despite sanctions. The leaked emails cover the first few months of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Through the emails, the Kyiv Independent identified an ecosystem of companies that came to the aid of Ruselectronics holding by building new supply chains for banned components. Using customs data, we also discovered a huge network of their foreign suppliers, mostly from China and Hong Kong. These records, together with our undercover experiment, prove that American and European-branded chips continue flowing to Russia &#x2014; the country that started the largest war in Europe since World War II. The U.S. and EU imposed sanctions and export restrictions immediately on the first day of Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and some even the day before. The restrictions, among other things, banned American and European chips from entering Russia, whose defense sector relies heavily on their use in producing weapons. Russia wasn&#x2019;t ready for it. From the leaked emails, it&#x2019;s clear that the producers had no significant stockpile of chips. On the second day of the invasion, one Ruselectronics employee emailed notes from an internal meeting to two colleagues. It mentions that &#x201C;delivery times for electronic components had increased, and prices had risen.&#x201D; The letter concludes that the holding would need to buy a year&#x2019;s worth of stock of electronic components. This and other emails suggest that the Russian arms manufacturer wasn&#x2019;t preparing for a protracted war. It didn&#x2019;t have extra stocks of imported chips at the start of the invasion but began procuring them immediately after the start of the invasion, bypassing the fresh restrictions. In April 2022, two months after the start of the invasion, Ruselectronics companies prepared proposals on how to reduce the risks of disruptions in the procurement of electronic components. Among other things, the proposals called for allocating additional funding to create stockpiles of electronic components. But the leaked letters reveal that suppliers faced difficulties procuring the electronics. In March 2022, Elitcom, a Russian supplier of Ruselectronics holding, wrote to say that it would fail to deliver chips produced by the American company Analog Devices on time. The contract for the chips was signed in December 2021, and one of Ruselectronics&#x2019; subsidiaries expected their delivery in May 2022. Elitcom explained that due to the Russian invasion, the American manufacturer had stopped deliveries to Russia, and Analog Devices&#x2019; official distributor &#x201C;did not confirm its readiness&#x201D; to fulfill the contract. But Elitcom had a plan and said it could arrange the supply of the necessary Analog Devices chips, despite sanctions. The company was offering to do so with the help of unnamed &#x201C;foreign partners&#x201D; who confirmed the chips would arrive in September-October 2022, several months later than originally planned. Similar cases occurred across the sector. Around that same time, a Russian electronics supplier, TestKomplekt, emailed a Ruselectronics&#x2019; subsidiary to warn that due to foreign restrictions, it had revised the terms of supply of American-branded chips, such as Analog Devices, Texas Instruments, Microchip Technology, Altera, Maxim Integrated, and others. Not a problem &#x2014; the company was still ready to supply them, but at new prices. The leaked emails contain direct evidence that Russian defense manufacturers can&#x2019;t produce weapons without Western chips, nor can they be substituted with analogs. For example, a sanctioned Ruselectronics&#x2019; subsidiary, the Istok Research and Production Corporation, argued that it needed to purchase certain American chips produced by Analog Devices because Russian and other analogs &#x201C;do not comply with the design documentation&#x201D; of the enterprise. The use of other chips &#x201C;is impossible,&#x201D; an internal note says. &#x201C;For the Russians, this stuff is absolutely critical,&#x201D; explains James Byrne, senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a London-headquartered security think tank. &#x201C;They can&apos;t build missiles without it. It&apos;s not like they&apos;re just going to give up.&#x201D; But the Russian arms manufacturers didn&#x2019;t have to give up the Western chips. There were those willing to supply them. An unobvious but important detail illustrated by the leaked emails is that Russian arms manufacturers don&#x2019;t import Western chips directly from abroad. They didn&#x2019;t do so even before the full-scale invasion. Instead, Russian arms manufacturers buy imported circuits within Russia. Whenever they need electronics, they tap into a vast network of Russian suppliers of imported electronic components like Elitcom or TestKomplekt. The network is a mix of state-owned and private companies that specialize in purchasing American and European chips. Some of them openly advertise the sale of American chips on their websites even now, in 2025, in the fourth year of the Russian war. It was these companies that came to the rescue of the Russian defense industry after the introduction of unprecedented Western export bans and sanctions, setting up workarounds to supply chips to Russia. These companies don&#x2019;t publicly advertise that their clients are Russian defense manufacturers. It is only through internal correspondence and access to contracts, which aren&#x2019;t public, that it becomes clear that these private firms with flashy websites are actually the lifeline of Russian missile production.

(Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)The leaked emails show that after the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine and the imposition of restrictions and sanctions, more than two dozen Russian providers of Western chips responded to Ruselectronics&#x2019; growing demand. Among them were Russian companies Modern Digital Technologies, Imotek, Elsup, AST Components, Orion-Electronika, Altex, Elesar-Grupp, Trade House Alfa-Komplekt ECB, Communication Systems Equipment, RTKT, GC Electromir, MTG, Electronintorg, and others. They confirmed their readiness to supply hundreds of different American-branded chips in response to requests from Ruselectronics&#x2019; subsidiaries in March&#x2013;April 2022. Some Russian chip suppliers took the initiative and approached representatives of Ruselectronics to advertise their capabilities, knowing they would struggle to obtain chips. In March 2022, the Russian design center Kristal wrote a letter to a Ruselectronics representative, informing him that the company had supply channels for imported electronic components from Texas Instruments, Analog Devices, Maxim, Microchip, Micron, NXP, Xilinx (AMD), Qorvo, and Broadcom. Kristal offered a meeting to discuss cooperation. &#x201C;Together with foreign partners, we have access to global distributors of electronic components,&#x201D; Kristal&#x2019;s CEO Leonid Zotov boasted in an email sent on the 19th day of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Who is behind suppliers like Kristal? Among the owners are a retired Russian major general, medium-sized entrepreneurs, a Russian oligarch, as well as employees of companies united in the state-owned Ruselectronics holding, or the Russian state defense corporation, Rostec, itself. For example, Elsup&#x2019;s owner is Vladislav Borodovitsyn. According to his Instagram page, he previously held a position as an employee of a research institute that is jointly controlled by Rostec and the investment company Sistema, owned by Russian oligarch Vladimir Yevtushenkov.

Among the co-owners of AST Components, we found the retired Russian Major General Magomed Tolboev, who was also an aspiring politician, and his son Ruslan. Commercial proposals sent by Russian suppliers at Ruselectronics&#x2019; request included American electronic components used in Russian missiles and other weapons. Among the offers, the Kyiv Independent identified a number of American chips that had been found in Kinzhals &#x2014; Russian ballistic missiles that carry a warhead of nearly 500 kilograms used in strikes on Kyiv and more distant cities, killing civilians. According to the leak, Russian intermediary companies were also ready to supply U.S. chips that are used in Russian Kalibr and R-77 missiles, as well as in the Tornado-G system capable of launching 40 rockets at once and in the Giatsint-S, a tank-mounted gun.

(Source image: Wikimedia, war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua, leaked emails)Although the leaked Ruselectronics&#x2019; emails don&#x2019;t extend beyond May 2022, Russian intermediaries did not exhaust their ability to supply the Russian defense industry with Western chips. The Kyiv Independent managed to obtain Russian tax records from 2024 with a list of contractors for one Ruselectronics&#x2019; subsidiary: the Istok Research and Production Corporation. In 2024, Istok continued to receive supplies from the majority of the Russian providers of imported circuits that we encountered in the leaked emails. The Kyiv Independent decided to try and order American chips through Russian suppliers in February 2025 &#x2014; and was successful. To confirm that the flow of Western chips to Russia is not a fiction, we carried out an undercover experiment. The Kyiv Independent took on the role of an employee of a real Ruselectronics&#x2019; subsidiary, the Almaz research and production enterprise, which produces electronic systems for military equipment. Surprisingly, the most difficult aspect of the experiment was to create an email account with a Russian email service, as they are blocked in Ukraine. When that was done, trying to buy banned Western chips in Russia was easy. The Kyiv Independent prepared a request for a commercial proposal on behalf of Almaz, asking for circuits produced by American-headquartered companies, and sent the request to two dozen Russian suppliers of American chips. Ten of them responded, confirming their ability to deliver the required chips. The Russian companies Imotek, AST Components, Elsup, Altex, RTKT, and Vneshtekhsnab confirmed they were ready to deliver chips in 1.5 to three months. Modern Digital Technologies, Electromir, and Imotek sent their offers, specifying the years of chip production. They included chips from Analog Devices, Texas Instruments, and Atmel manufactured in 2022-2024. One of the Russian companies, Elesar-Grupp, sent a full list of the chips it currently had in its warehouse, indicating their quantity. There were millions of chips of famous American and European brands. The list, provided to the Kyiv Independent when it reached out under the guise of an Almaz employee, included chips from American manufacturers Analog Devices, Texas Instruments, Microchip Technology, Xilinx (AMD), ON Semiconductor, Intel, Dutch NXP, German Infineon, and many others. Among them were those used in Russian missiles and attack drones. In the fourth year of Russia&apos;s full-scale war in Ukraine, those American and European chips are still available to Russian intermediary firms, and through them &#x2014; to Russian arms manufacturers. Due to strict export bans imposed after the start of the full-scale invasion, Western chipmakers have stopped direct deliveries to Russia and banned official distributors from supplying their parts to Russian companies. Instead, Western chips enter Russia through third countries that have not imposed restrictions. The main suppliers of American chips to Russia are China and Hong Kong. Customs data since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022 shows that dozens of companies, mainly registered in Hong Kong and China, sent Western chips to Russian electronic component traders cooperating with Ruselectronics holding. The companies are either Chinese providers of Western microelectronics with many years of experience or newly established entities without websites and public contact information. According to ImportGenius, the Hong Kong-based electronic component seller Analog Technology has supplied Western chips to the Russian companies Modern Digital Technologies and Imotek since 2022. Hong Kong-based Analog Technology was established in 2011 and positions itself as a seller of chips &#x201C;of all famous worldwide brands.&#x201D; It supplied all well-known American and European chip brands to Russian firms despite Western export restrictions, according to trade data. Another Hong Kong-based company, Icscan Electronic, registered in 2022, presents itself as a &#x201C;famous international one-stop purchasing service provider of electronic components,&#x201D; and has sold chips of various American brands to Russian Elsup. Chinese Berton Electronics, which claims to be &#x201C;an agent of electronic components of well-known brands,&#x201D; sold Western-branded chips to Russian Modern Digital Technologies. In their turn, Russian companies Elsup, Modern Digital Technologies, Imotek, and other chip traders resold imported circuits to Ruselectronics holding. The following chart provides a glimpse into the scale of the Chinese distribution network of Western chips.

(Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)The data provides insights into the link in the chain that gets U.S. chips into Russia despite export bans. In this chain, Chinese suppliers resell the chips to Russian buyers that then supply them to the Russian defense industry. How many times chips are sold and resold before ending up in a Russian defense company is anyone&#x2019;s guess. According to customs records, American chips are produced in different countries, including the U.S., China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines, and others. In other words, some of these chips were most likely manufactured in American factories located outside the U.S. &#x201C;The key Western producers have several production facilities in countries like China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and a few in Thailand and Taiwan. Some of these are Chinese factories working on license, while others are daughter companies,&#x201D; says Erlend B Bjortvedt, founder of Corisk, an Oslo-based consulting company that explores sanctions and sanction evasion. Bjortvedt adds that &#x201C;this does not reduce their liabilities to follow sanctions&#x201D;. &#x201C;This liability includes daughter companies and U.S. and EU citizens in the management or board of daughter companies abroad,&#x201D; he explains. Further sanctions on foreign companies that help Russia obtain scarce weapons components, as well as increased compliance by Western manufacturers, are two key steps to reduce such supplies, experts say. &#x201C;When a product that is prohibited for sale to Russia, according to U.S. rules, goes from China to Russia, this is not a violation from China&apos;s perspective. However, it would be a violation of sanctions from the U.S. point of view,&#x201D; explains Vladyslav Vlasiuk, Ukraine&apos;s presidential commissioner for sanctions policy. &#x201C;That&apos;s why Chinese companies that supply microelectronics to Russia appear on U.S. sanctions lists,&#x201D; Vlasiuk explains. It is noteworthy that half of the Chinese chip suppliers to Ruselectronics holding identified by the Kyiv Independent, as well as their Russian buyers, are not yet under U.S. sanctions. That is, their activities have not yet been noticed by the authorized U.S. sanctions authorities. The Kyiv Independent reached out to dozens of Chinese companies mentioned in this article for comments, but did not receive any replies by the time of publication. James Byrne of RUSI spoke to the Kyiv Independent about his experience of communicating with chip manufacturers. According to him, they complain that they have limited visibility, meaning they can only see &#x201C;one or two steps down with the chain.&#x201D; &#x201C;If you&apos;re Texas Instruments or Intel, you have large distributors. The distributors sell components to all sorts of entities all over the world. Let&apos;s say you sell to some distributor in Hong Kong, and then they sell to another entity in Hong Kong, and that entity ships them to the Russians. I think it&apos;s a difficult problem to solve, but it doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s impossible.&#x201D; The Kyiv Independent contacted all the Western chipmakers mentioned in the article. Those who responded called the resale of their chips to Russia illicit and unauthorized, condemning it. Reactions from chip manufacturers on third-party supplies to Russia. Part 1. (Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)Reactions from chip manufacturers on third-party supplies to Russia. Part 2. (Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)Large manufacturers can tighten control over who they sell banned goods to and refuse risky customers, some of the experts say. &#x201C;Western chips manufacturers have had tremendous growth and profits over the last decades, but they have not invested in compliance and internal investigation,&#x201D; says Erlend B Bjortvedt, who works closely with customs data analysis at Corisk. &#x201C;One company I researched had 60,000 employees but did not see big and obvious red flags in their value chain,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;The loopholes in the digital components industry can be closed by forcing producers to invest in internal control resources through preventive investigations with strong penalties, and by deterring third parties through forceful secondary sanctions of foreign banks,&#x201D; according to Bjortvedt. Until that happens, American and European components make it possible to produce new batches of Russian weapons that attack Ukrainian cities and kill civilians. Hi, this is Alisa Yurchenko, the author of this story. I&#x2019;m writing this note shortly after reading the news that the U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a suspension of military aid to Ukraine &#x2014; a move that will manifest, among other things, that Ukraine might not have the way to protect itself from the Russian missiles. It adds to the bitterness of this moment is the understanding that Russian missiles that have been hitting Ukraine in the past three years would not have been produced if it wasn&#x2019;t for the Western chips and other components. Stories like this can create the wrong impression that export restrictions on critical components to Russia have failed. But they did have some effect. The need for workarounds made the chips 40 percent more expensive for Russian importers. We see it in the leaked emails dating back to the first months of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Another, even more important result is a reduction in Russian imports of digital components and chips after December 2022, according to sanctions analysts. The trade through intermediaries has slowed down, they say. This gives us hope that if the pressure on Western chip sales through China, Hong Kong and other third countries is increased, Russia will not be able to produce missiles and other weapons.

Lukashenko appoints Alexander Turchin as Belarus's new PM	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has appointed Alexander Turchin as the country&#x2019;s new prime minister, state-owned news agency Belta reported on March 10. Turchin, who previously served as head of the Minsk regional executive committee, held key government positions, including chief of staff of the Council of Ministers in 2016 and first deputy prime minister in 2018-2019. After his appointment, Turchin told reporters that Belarus would not see any &quot;significant course correction,&quot; adding that his approach would be one of &quot;evolution without revolutions.&quot; Turchin is replacing Roman Golovchenko, who has held the office of prime minister since June 2020 and was now appointed head of the National Bank. Lukashenko presented the personnel changes as the advent of a &quot;new generation&quot; in Belarusian leadership. Lukashenko, in power since 1994 and widely regarded as Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s close ally, has faced repeated accusations of election fraud. His self-declared victory in the 2020 presidential election, widely denounced as illegitimate, triggered mass protests in Minsk that were brutally suppressed with Moscow&#x2019;s backing. Since then, over 8,000 people have been detained for political reasons, according to the Belarusian human rights group Viasna. On Jan. 26, Lukashenko claimed a seventh term in office in another election widely condemned as neither free nor fair. Though Belarus has not directly participated in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, it has allowed the Kremlin to use its territory as a staging ground for military operations.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-appoints-new-belarus-prime-minister/	2025-03-10T05:48:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/595a60fb-8831-3f7c-fa06-c257a42d8a53.jpg
Ukraine to buy 4.5 million FPV drones in 2025	Ukraine plans to purchase 4.5 million first-person-view (FPV) drones this year as part of a large-scale effort to equip its military with advanced technologies, the Defense Ministry reported on March 10. The total cost of the procurement exceeds Hr 110 billion ($2.6 billion), with Hr 102 billion ($2.4 billion) allocated through the Defense Procurement Agency. FPV drones, which are cost-effective and capable of precise targeting, have proven highly effective in destroying expensive military equipment. The Defense Ministry purchased several thousands of drones in 2023, while the following year, the amount increased to 1.5 million, said Hlib Kanevsky, head of the ministry&apos;s procurement department. Roughly 96% of the allocated sum went to Ukrainian producers and suppliers. Both Ukraine and Russia have increasingly relied on drone warfare, using aerial, naval, and ground-based drones for reconnaissance and combat missions. The number of Russian targets destroyed by Ukrainian drones rose by 22% in February compared to January, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi reported. Kyiv has also been accelerating the production of long-range missile-drone hybrids, with President Volodymyr Zelensky setting a target of at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-buy-4-5-million-fpv-drones-in-2025/	2025-03-10T05:10:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1574618594.jpg
Russia's arms exports plunge by 47% since full-scale invasion's start, SIPRI reports	Russia&apos;s arms exports fell by 47% in 2024 compared to 2022, when Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to a March report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). The decline is attributed to Russia prioritizing weapons production for its own military, the impact of Western sanctions, and increased pressure from the U.S. and its allies on countries purchasing Russian arms, the report said. Since 2022, Western sanctions have targeted Russian banks, energy exports, and dual-use goods, further straining Moscow&#x2019;s arms trade. Over the past five years, Russian arms exports have dropped by 64%, shrinking the country&#x2019;s global market share to 7.8%. While Russia supplied arms to 47 countries between 2018 and 2022, that number dropped to 33 in 2024. Asia and Oceania accounted for 74% of Russian exports, Africa 12%, and Europe 7.4%. India remains Russia&#x2019;s largest buyer, accounting for 38% of sales, followed by China (17%) and Kazakhstan (11%). Russia is still set to deliver arms under deals with India, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. Despite its declining market share, Russia remains one of the world&#x2019;s top three arms exporters, SIPRI noted. The U.S. continues to lead, controlling 43% of global arms exports.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-arms-exports-plunge-by-47-since-full-scale-invasion-sipri-reports/	2025-03-10T04:48:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2006245916.jpg
Russia attempting to gain foothold in Sumy Oblast, Border Guard warns	Russian forces are attempting to establish a foothold near Novenke, a Ukrainian village in Sumy Oblast near the border with Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, State Border Guard spokesperson Andrii Demchenko said on air on March 10. The news comes after Russia reportedly achieved a breakthrough in Kursk Oblast, seeking to encircle the Ukrainian forces fighting there and penetrate the Ukrainian border. &quot;These are small assault units, composed of a few people. They try to penetrate our territory, accumulate forces, and advance further into Ukraine, probably to cut off logistical routes,&quot; Demchenko said on national television. Moscow&apos;s troops have been reportedly trying to push toward Novenke, a village lying 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the regional center, Sumy, for several weeks. The battlefield situation at the Ukraine-Russia border areas of the Sumy and Kursk oblasts as of March 10, 2025, according to DeepState. The village of Novenke marked with a black symbol, the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast marked in blue. (DeepState/Open Street Maps)Ukrainian artillery and drone units continue attacking Russian troops, preventing them from accumulating forces, the spokesperson added. Concerns about the Ukrainian operation in Kursk Oblast, ongoing since August 2024, have mounted over the weekend amid reports of Russian advances. The development came shortly after the U.S. cut off military and intelligence support for Ukraine, allegedly to push Kyiv to the negotiating table. A potential loss of the Kursk salient or Russian advances in Sumy Oblast would likely weaken Ukraine&apos;s negotiating position as it prepares for initial rounds of talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia. Russian forces have begun collapsing the northern part of the Ukrainian Kursk salient, while destroyed bridges complicate Ukraine&apos;s ability to withdraw toward the key town of Sudzha, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think-tank said on March 9. Moscow has also reportedly deployed North Korean troops in the renewed attack in Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-attempting-to-gain-foothold-in-sumy-oblast-border-guard-warns/	2025-03-10T04:33:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204125313.jpg
Ukrainian drones mark 22% increase in Russian target destruction in February, Syrskyi says	The number of Russian targets destroyed by Ukrainian drones increased by 22% in February compared to January, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi reported on March 10, underscoring the importance of unmanned systems on the battlefield. The commander noted that first-person-view (FPV) drones and multi-rotor bombers remain the most effective tools. &quot;Unmanned systems have become one of the most important elements of warfare that save the lives of our soldiers,&quot; Syrskyi said after a monthly meeting on drone development. He stressed the need to introduce a unified standard for unmanned systems in Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces to improve coordination between units. Syrskyi also warned that Russia is rapidly adapting to Ukraine&#x2019;s drone warfare strategies and developing its own technologies, including fiber-optic-controlled drones. &quot;We have no right to lag behind... (Russia) in the technological war and must strengthen ourselves at the expense of our own resources,&quot; he added. Kyiv has significantly expanded domestic drone production over the past year, integrating drones into reconnaissance and combat operations. On Feb. 9, the Defense Ministry launched the &quot;Drone Line&quot; initiative to accelerate their deployment on the battlefield. Ukraine has also developed long-range missile-drone hybrids, such as the Palianytsia and Peklo models, featuring turbojet engines as alternatives to cruise missiles. President Volodymyr Zelensky has set a target of producing at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-drones-february/	2025-03-10T04:14:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2171705016.jpg
US officially closes 83% of USAID programs	The U.S. has officially canceled 83% of U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs, with the roughly 1,000 remaining contracts to be administered by the State Department, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on March 10. The decision to cancel 5,200 USAID contracts comes after a six-week review of the U.S.&apos;s top foreign aid agency, which the Trump administration accused of waste, fraud, and pushing a &quot;liberal agenda.&quot; Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support to Kyiv. The agency has funded school reconstruction, bomb shelters, critical energy repairs, and civil society initiatives. Elon Musk, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s ally who supposedly oversees the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has led the charge against USAID, laying off staff and attacking the agency in public, often making baseless or false claims about its work. Rubio thanked DOGE for &quot;this overdue and historic reform,&quot; claiming that the aborted contracts have &quot;spent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, (and in some cases even harmed), the core national interests of the United States.&quot; He did not provide any examples of how USAID programs endangered U.S. interests. The cuts are nevertheless smaller than indicated by a statement from the Trump administration last month, which talked about slashing 90% of all contracts. USAID cuts mark a significant realignment of U.S. foreign policy, which saw the Trump administration adopt increasingly hostile rhetoric toward Ukraine and other partners while seeking to renew ties with Moscow. The mass cancelation of USAID contracts also threatens various Ukrainian organizations and projects across multiple sectors, including energy, education, media, and humanitarian support.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-officially-closes-83-of-usaid-programs/	2025-03-10T03:36:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197486320.jpg
Ukraine arrests Kharkiv resident suspected of bombing, poisoning plot on Russia's behalf	Ukrainian security forces have detained a suspected agent of Russian intelligence who allegedly orchestrated an explosion near a war veteran&#x2019;s home and poisoned a soldier under the guise of providing volunteer aid, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) reported on March 10. According to the investigation, the suspect, an IT specialist from Kharkiv, was recruited by Russian intelligence services and tasked with assembling improvised explosive devices (IEDs) containing metal fragments to maximize casualties. She allegedly hid one of the devices in a designated cache, where an accomplice retrieved it and placed it near the home of a Ukrainian army veteran. The explosion injured the veteran, who was later hospitalized. The SBU also accused the woman of poisoning a soldier by lacing food and medicine with toxic substances while posing as a volunteer. The serviceman was hospitalized and is in serious condition. Investigators believe Russian intelligence operatives first approached the suspect before the full-scale invasion when she was visiting relatives in Russia. By early 2025, she was receiving direct instructions from her handlers, the SBU said. Authorities are now investigating her potential involvement in other crimes. The court has ordered her detention without bail while the case proceeds.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-arrest-suspected-russian-agent-in-kharkiv-over-bombing-poisoning-plot/	2025-03-10T03:10:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/c0b50b27d0cf14e59599c06e8af88ab2.jpeg
EU prepares for possible Hungarian veto on Russia sanctions extension, media reports	The European Union is bracing for a potential Hungarian veto on extending sanctions against Russia, which are set to expire on March 15, Euractiv reported on March 10, citing undisclosed sources. EU diplomats were reportedly surprised that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban did not attempt to block the conclusions of the March 6 European Council meeting on Ukraine. The Hungarian prime minister declined to sign the summit&apos;s declaration in support of Ukraine, but the document was nevertheless published with the endorsement of 26 member states. Orban, widely regarded as the EU&apos;s most pro-Russian leader, has repeatedly opposed military aid for Ukraine and warned that Ukraine&apos;s EU membership would &quot;destroy&quot; Hungary. He has maintained ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin despite Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, amplifying Kremlin narratives in Europe. Diplomats suspect Orban&#x2019;s restraint at the summit was linked to the upcoming renewal of EU sanctions on Russia, which require unanimous approval from all 27 member states, Euractiv reported. The Hungarian prime minister has a history of leveraging EU decision-making to extract concessions. He has previously secured exemptions for Russian Patriarch Kirill and the domestic use of Russian oil products. Patriarch Kirill, a Kremlin ally and head of the Russian Orthodox Church, has openly supported Russia&#x2019;s war, yet Budapest has repeatedly blocked EU efforts to sanction him. The EU&apos;s sanctions framework includes economic measures and a list of over 2,400 individuals and entities subject to asset freezes and travel bans. If Hungary blocks the renewal, it could force the EU to negotiate additional compromises or risk a lapse in sanctions enforcement.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-prepares-for-possible-hungarian-veto-on-russia-sanctions-extension-media-reports/	2025-03-10T03:02:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2097682027.jpg
Come to Bucha, JD Vance	During a heated exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, U.S. Vice President JD Vance accused the Ukrainian president of leading &#x201C;propaganda tours&#x201D; of Russia&#x2019;s destruction in the country. Zelensky, in turn, asked Vance if he had ever been to Ukraine. Of course, Vance&#x2019;s criticism of Ukraine is not new. In a New York Times op-ed released in April 2024, Vance argued that America shouldn&#x2019;t help Ukraine, citing the burden of producing weapon systems like 155 mm shells and Patriot missiles. He suggested that the U.S. should pressure Ukraine to surrender territory it has lost to Russia and claimed that supporting Ukraine &#x201C;doesn&#x2019;t add up.&#x201D; Before Vance makes further assumptions and jeopardizes diplomatic relations with Ukraine, I&#x2019;m pleading &#x2014; with all due respect, as a fellow Ohioan &#x2014; for him to do what I did: travel to Ukraine and visit the town of Bucha, located in the suburbs of Kyiv. Bucha is the site of some of the first war crimes committed by the Russian army in Ukraine, uncovered in the initial months of the full-scale war. Seeing Bucha will help Vance understand that this war is about more than just territory; it&#x2019;s a war between good and evil. I&#x2019;m not an aid worker or foreign fighter. My visit to Ukraine was personal. In the early 2000s, as a record executive for Universal Music Group, I helped develop Ukraine&#x2019;s music industry. In May 2023, after more than a year of full-scale war, I traveled to Kyiv to check on my colleagues. I took the Kyiv Express, a 17-hour train from Warsaw to Kyiv. I saw destruction everywhere: bombed-out apartment buildings, malls, and machine gun-riddled cars and homes. Even a statue of the poet Taras Shevchenko had been shot up in the Borodianka town square. One of my colleagues offered to bring me to Bucha. Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw. I visited the site where mass graves were uncovered behind the local church. I spoke with an elderly church worker who survived the massacre by hiding in the basement for days. Listening to her terrifying account and seeing the destruction firsthand made it clear to me: this is a war of good versus evil.

(Ronaldo Schemidt / AFP via Getty Images)Bucha is one of many reasons why Ukraine cannot simply surrender territory to Russia. The war crimes uncovered in Bucha were revealed only after the Russian army was driven out, three months after its occupation. In the territories Vance wants to hand over to Russia, war crimes have been committed daily for over two years &#x2014; including torture, executions, and the kidnapping of children. By suggesting America should pull back from helping Ukraine, Vance risks ignoring these atrocities. As a loyal Republican, Vance would do well to look to former U.S. President Ronald Reagan for inspiration. Reagan confronted evil with steely determination, resulting in the end of the Cold War. For Reagan, American values justified confronting the Soviet Union &#x2014; not excuses like production problems in weapons factories. Reagan, who loved Ohio and won the state&#x2019;s presidential election twice, understood the crucial role Ohio&#x2019;s military bases and weapons manufacturing played in the Cold War. But if Reagan were here today, I believe he would strongly disagree with Vance&#x2019;s policy of weakness. As a fellow Ohioan, I don&#x2019;t understand Vance&#x2019;s weak view of America. I grew up on a family farm in central Ohio, but we were both raised with the same Midwestern values &#x2014; to support good and confront evil. And what the Russian army is doing in Ukraine is among the greatest evils of this century. Both of us learned about Ohio&#x2019;s greatest figures in public schools, from abolitionists Harriet Beecher Stowe and Sojourner Truth to astronauts John Glenn and Neil Armstrong &#x2014; individuals who demonstrated courage and bravery.

Russia expels 2 British diplomats, accuses them of espionage	Russia said on March 10 it had stripped the accreditation of two British nationals linked to the U.K. Embassy in Moscow, accusing them of espionage and &quot;subversive&quot; activities and ordering them to leave within two weeks. The move comes as the latest tit-for-tat move in a diplomatic row between London and Moscow. Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB) claimed it had &quot;identified signs of intelligence and subversive work&quot; by a second secretary of the British Embassy in Moscow and the spouse of another British diplomat. The FSB did not provide evidence to support the claims nor revealed further details of the diplomats&apos; alleged activities. The British Embassy denied the allegations as &quot;completely baseless,&quot; independent outlet Meduza reported, citing the Embassy&apos;s spokesperson. The U.K. previously expelled a Russian diplomat in February, while Moscow threw out six U.K. Embassy staff members in September 2024. Tensions between Russia and the U.K. have been mounting since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and London threw its military and political backing behind Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-expels-2-brits-accuses-them-of-espionage/	2025-03-10T02:43:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2170878445.jpg
No US-Russia meetings planned this week, Moscow says, denying media claims	No U.S.-Russia meetings will take place this week, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told Russian state-owned news agency TASS on March 10, disputing claims in the media. &quot;(A meeting) is not planned. Moreover, we received no information from the American side,&quot; Zakharova said in response to a journalist&apos;s question. This comes as CNN reported, citing a source, that the U.S. will hold separate meetings with Ukrainian and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia this week. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. The possible meeting would follow previous rounds of U.S.-Russia talks in Riyadh on Feb. 18 and Istanbul on Feb. 27. The news came amid U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s push for a swift settlement to the war, raising concerns that Washington is sidelining Ukraine and European allies in the process. Ukrainian and U.S. delegations are set to meet in Jeddah on March 11 to discuss a potential peace agreement with Russia and negotiations on a critical minerals deal. U.S. officials will reportedly assess Ukraine&#x2019;s willingness to mend ties with Washington following a contentious Oval Office exchange between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28. The fallout from that meeting led to the suspension of all U.S. military aid to Ukraine, worth billions, and a halt in intelligence sharing, potentially hampering Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to detect Russian missile strikes and conduct long-range attacks. The Financial Times reported that Ukraine is expected to push for the restoration of U.S. military and intelligence support at the March 11 meeting. As part of its negotiating position, Kyiv is reportedly prepared to propose a partial ceasefire covering long-range drone and missile strikes, as well as hostilities in the Black Sea, in hopes of securing renewed U.S. backing. Trump told reporters on March 9 that he expects Ukraine to sign the long-debated critical minerals deal with the U.S. but also wants to see indications that Kyiv is prepared for peace. Zelensky and European leaders have repeatedly stressed that security guarantees, including long-term U.S. support, must accompany any ceasefire agreement. Washington has yet to provide such assurances. Following his meeting with Trump, Zelensky reaffirmed Ukraine&#x2019;s commitment to working with the U.S. toward a negotiated settlement.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-us-meeting/	2025-03-10T02:11:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1237721878.jpg
Ukraine, German arms maker seek to triple IRIS-T air defense supply	Ukraine has signed a memorandum with German defense manufacturer Diehl Defense to triple the supply of IRIS-T air defense systems and missiles, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on March 9. The deal comes as Ukraine faces intensified Russian aerial assaults, including Russia&#x2019;s strike on Feb. 23, which marked the single largest drone attack since the start of the full-scale invasion. &quot;The signed agreement paves the way for large industrial projects that will strengthen the capabilities of Ukraine&apos;s air defense,&quot; Umerov wrote on Facebook. The IRIS-T is a modern surface-to-air missile system capable of countering aircraft, helicopters, drones, and cruise missiles. Germany has been a key supplier of the system, with outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announcing an order for 17 additional IRIS-T systems for Ukraine last September. In late December, President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed that Ukraine had received Germany&#x2019;s sixth IRIS-T battery.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-diehl-defense-sign-deal/	2025-03-10T01:12:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1241457826.jpeg
6 killed, 22 injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over past day	At least six people were killed and 22 others injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over the past day, regional officials reported on March 10. Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force said it had intercepted 130 of the 176 Russian drones launched overnight, including Shahed-type attack drones. Another 42 drones reportedly disappeared from radars before reaching their targets, indicating they were likely decoys meant to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defenses. Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare systems, aviation, and mobile fire groups repelled the attack. In Donetsk Oblast, three civilians were killed &#x2014; two in Pokrovsk and one in Zoria. Six others were wounded, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. Three more civilians &#x2014; a woman and two men &#x2014; were killed in Kharkiv Oblast by an explosive device dropped from a Russian drone, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Another woman was injured in the attack. In Kherson Oblast, nine people were injured, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a 56-year-old woman was hospitalized and is in moderate condition as a result of a Russian attack, and an 18-year-old girl was treated at the scene, Governor Serhii Lysak said. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, a 16-year-old boy and two men, aged 65 and 67, were wounded. A 79-year-old woman was also injured in an artillery strike, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-over-past-day-2/	2025-03-10T00:29:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-10_05-31-36.jpg

Half of global population descended from ancient group in what is now Ukraine, DNA research shows	Half of the human beings alive today are descended from the Yamnaya culture, a group that lived in what is now Ukraine 5,000 years ago, according to new DNA research led by David Reich, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School, the Wall Street Journal reported on March 8. Around 4 billion people can trace their ancestry to the Yamnaya, a community of cattle herders who lived in the areas that make up the modern-day Ukraine and expanded dramatically across Europe and Asia, the research shows. Researchers identified the village of Mykhailivka, lying in the Russian-occupied part of Kherson Oblast, as the genetic birthplace of the Indo-European peoples who spread across the European continent and West Asia in waves of migrations. The equestrian culture, dubbed Yamnaya after the pits (yama in Ukrainian and Russian) in which they buried their dead beneath mounds called kurgans, is seen as a shared ancestor to various ancient peoples, including the Romans, Celts, Persians, and Macedonians. The new DNA research analyzed remains of 450 prehistoric individuals from 100 sites across Europe and 1,000 previously known ancient samples, reinforcing earlier theories on the spread of the Yamnaya culture based on archeological and linguistic evidence. The ongoing Russian occupation of the Yamnaya culture&apos;s cradle undercores the damage wrought to Ukraine&apos;s cultural heritage by Moscow&apos;s war. As of February, 485 Ukrainian cultural sites have been confirmed as damaged during the war, including two archeological sites. Russia has also consistently looted Ukrainian artifacts from Crimea, Donbas, and elsewhere since 2014, transporting many to Russian museums.	https://kyivindependent.com/half-global-population-descended-from-ancient-group-who-lived-in-ukraine-new-dna-research-shows/	2025-03-10T00:20:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1437004229.jpg
Ukraine to push for resumption of US military, intelligence support at Saudi talks, FT reports	Ukrainian officials will push for the resumption of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing at upcoming talks in Saudi Arabia, the Financial Times reported on March 9, citing its undisclosed sources. Ukrainian and U.S. delegations are set to meet in Jeddah on March 11 to discuss a potential peace agreement with Russia and negotiations on a critical minerals deal. As part of its strategy, Kyiv is reportedly prepared to propose a partial ceasefire covering long-range drone and missile strikes, as well as hostilities in the Black Sea, in hopes that progress in talks will prompt Washington to lift its freeze on military and intelligence support. Following President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s heated meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, Washington suspended all military aid to Ukraine, worth billions. CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed on March 5 that the U.S. had also halted intelligence sharing, potentially limiting Ukraine&apos;s ability to detect Russian missile strikes and carry out long-range attacks. Two European officials told the FT that Ukraine views making progress in ceasefire talks as a necessary step to regaining U.S. support. A U.S. official told Reuters that the Jeddah meeting will serve as a test of Ukraine&#x2019;s willingness to make concessions to Russia in pursuit of a peace deal. Trump told reporters on March 9 that he expects Ukraine to sign the critical minerals deal with the U.S. but also wants to see signals that Kyiv is prepared for peace. Zelensky and European leaders have repeatedly emphasized that security guarantees, including long-term U.S. support, must accompany any ceasefire agreement. Washington has not offered such assurances. Following his Oval Office meeting with Trump, Zelensky struck a conciliatory tone, reaffirming Ukraine&#x2019;s commitment to working with the U.S. toward a peace agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-push-for-resumption-of-us-military-aid-intelligence-sharing-at-saudi-talks-ft-reports/	2025-03-09T23:50:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1494251171-1.jpeg
Drones reportedly attack 'one of 10 largest' Russian oil refineries	Drones attacked the Novokuybyshevsk oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Samara Oblast overnight on March 10, the independent Telegram channel Astra and a Ukrainian official claimed. Ukraine has systematically targeted Russian oil refineries, military sites, and warehouses deep behind the front lines to undermine Moscow&apos;s capacity to wage its all-out war. Samara Oblast residents reported loud explosions overnight, Astra wrote, adding that a fire was recorded at the Rosneft-run oil facility. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified. The refinery&apos;s &quot;capacity amounts to 8.8 million metric tons of oil per year, making it one of the 10 largest (refineries) in Russia,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. The plant produces gasoline, diesel fuel, and fuel oil, &quot;which are critically important for transport and military equipment,&quot; the official added. The city of Novokuybyshevsk lies roughly 900 kilometers (560 miles) from the front line in Ukraine. &quot;This refinery is strategically important for the Russian military as it ensures a stable fuel supply for military operations,&quot; Kovalenko said. The Russian pro-state agency RBC reported a fire at a warehouse in Novokuybyshevsk that covered an area of 1,500 square meters later the same day, without mentioning a drone attack. No casualties were reported. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its forces had shot down nine Ukrainian drones overnight, including three over Samara Oblast, two each over the Voronezh and Oryol oblasts, and one each over the Belgorod and Kursk oblasts. On March 9, a Ukrainian drone reportedly attacked an oil depot in Cheboksary in Russia&apos;s Chuvashia Republic, marking the first strike against the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-reportedly-attack-russian-refinery-in-samara-oblast/	2025-03-09T23:33:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-630457640.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 886,320 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 886,320 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on March 10. This number includes 1,190 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,292 tanks, 21,400 armored fighting vehicles, 40,071 vehicles and fuel tanks, 24,271 artillery systems, 1,311 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,102 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 28,603 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-885-130-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022-2/	2025-03-09T23:13:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1258556806.jpeg
Lammy vows to unfreeze billions for Ukraine from Russian oligarch's Chelsea FC sale	U.K. Foreign Minister David Lammy vowed on March 9 to unfreeze billions of dollars of revenue earned from Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich&apos;s sale of the Chelsea Football Club (FC) and send the funds to Ukraine. Abramovich was forced to sell Chelsea FC once sanctions were enacted against him following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Abramovich and U.K. officials previously promised the funds from the sale would go to Ukraine. &quot;I&apos;m frustrated that it hasn&apos;t happened, is the truth &#x2014; and that money needs to be distributed, it needs to be used,&quot; Lammy told the Financial Times (FT) on March 9. 2.3 billion pounds ($2.97 billion) are currently frozen in a U.K. dedicated trust as officials decide how to obtain and utilize the funds. &quot;I&apos;m determined to see that money get out the door and to do all I can to bring that about,&quot; Lammy said. There are legal complexities, but Lammy said his &quot;first instinct is not litigation&quot; because of how long it could take. The U.K. government previously reported that the funds intended to help Ukraine remained in limbo due to a disagreement between U.K. officials and Abramovich. Ukraine&apos;s European allies are rushing to increase support following a military aid pause from the U.S. The U.K. has promised to deliver more military aid to Kyiv this year than ever before.	https://kyivindependent.com/lammy-vows-to-unfreeze-billions-for-ukraine-from-formerly-oligarch-owned-chelsea-fc/	2025-03-09T21:57:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2197755073.jpg
US to assess if Ukraine ready for 'realistic peace' at upcoming meeting, Reuters reports	The U.S. delegation that is set to meet with its Ukrainian counterpart on March 11 will assess if Ukraine is ready for a &quot;realistic peace,&quot; Reuters reported on March 10, citing unnamed officials. Ukrainians and U.S. officials will meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to discuss the framework of a peace agreement with Russia and continue talks on a critical minerals deal. The U.S. delegation will reportedly be looking for hints Ukraine is committed to improving ties with Washington following a heated argument between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 28. &quot;We want to see if the Ukrainians are interested not just in peace, but in a realistic peace,&quot; an unnamed U.S. official said. As part of their assessment, U.S. officials want to see whether or not Ukraine is ready to make concessions to Russia in order to end the war. &quot;You can&apos;t say &apos;I want peace,&apos; and, &apos;I refuse to compromise on anything,&apos;&quot; an unnamed official said. &quot;If they are only interested in 2014 or 2022 borders, that tells you something,&quot; another official said. Earlier on March 9, NBC News reported that the Trump administration did not plan to resume intelligence sharing and providing military aid until Zelensky indicated he was willing to make territorial concessions to Russia as part of a peace deal. The U.S. froze military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine in the days following the Oval Office clash. Trump told reporters on March 9 that the U.S. was &quot;just about&quot; to lift the pause on intelligence sharing. He also said he was optimistic about the Saudi Arabia talks. &quot;We&apos;re going to make a lot of progress, I believe, this week,&quot; he said. The delegation will be led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Trump&apos;s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. The officials previously met with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18. The two sides discussed restoring bilateral relations and held preliminary peace talks without Ukraine&apos;s participation.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-will-assess-if-ukraine-ready-for-realistic-peace-at-upcoming-meeting-reuters-reports/	2025-03-09T20:44:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199704911.jpg
JD Vance's cousin, former volunteer fighter in Ukraine, condemns VP's 'ambush' of Zelensky	Nate Vance, the cousin of U.S. Vice President JD Vance and a volunteer fighting on Ukraine&apos;s front lines, said he is &quot;disappointed&quot; in his relative&apos;s stance on Ukraine. Vance, a former U.S. Marine, defended Ukraine from 2022 to January 2025 as a member of the Da Vinci Wolves First Motorized Battalion, a volunteer unit. &quot;Being your family doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;m going to accept you killing my comrades,&quot; Vance said in an interview with Le Figaro published on March 9. Vance&apos;s remarks come at a low point in U.S.-Ukrainian relations, as Washington has halted intelligence sharing and military aid to Kyiv. The freeze followed a contentious meeting in the Oval Office between U.S. President Donald Trump, Vice President Vance, and President Volodymyr Zelensky. &#xA0; Nate Vance said he was disappointed in how his cousin treated Zelensky during the meeting. &quot;When (JD Vance) criticized aid to Ukraine, I thought it was because he needed to appeal to his electorate, that it was part of the political game,&quot; Vance said. &quot;But what they did to Zelensky was an ambush of absolute dishonesty.&quot; The vice president&apos;s continued distrust of Zelensky is unjustified, as are his views on Ukraine, Vance said. &quot;I thought I was going to choke ... His own cousin was on the front lines. I could have told him the truth, without pretense, without personal interest. He never tried to find out more.&quot; Vance said he tried to get in touch with his cousin several times with no success. &quot;I left messages at his office. I never heard from him,&quot; he said. Vance volunteered to fight in Ukraine following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, but left shortly before the U.S. presidential inauguration out of fear of being captured by the Russian army. &quot;It had become complicated to stay. I couldn&apos;t take the risk of being captured,&quot; he said. JD Vance has criticized Ukraine and Zelensky in the past, at times repeating Kremlin talking points. Protestors confronted the vice president for his treatment of Zelensky on several occasions following the Feb. 28 meeting.	https://kyivindependent.com/cousin-of-jd-vance-decries-vps-stance-on-ukraine/	2025-03-09T20:12:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201826980.jpg
US has 'just about' lifted pause on intelligence sharing with Ukraine, Trump tells media	The United States has &quot;just about&quot; ended its freeze on intelligence sharing with Kyiv, U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on March 9. CIA Director John Ratcliffe announced on March 5 that the U.S. had halted intelligence sharing with Ukraine, amid the fallout of the White House argument between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. The move followed Washington&apos;s decision to immediately freeze all military aid to Ukraine. According to Reuters, when asked whether the U.S. would end the suspension of intelligence sharing, Trump told reporters, &quot;We just about have. We just about have.&quot; Trump also said he was optimistic about the upcoming talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia. Delegations will meet in the city of Jeddah on March 11 to discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. The meeting comes at a low point in U.S.-Ukrainian relations, with Washington exerting enormous pressure on Kyiv to accept a peace deal regardless of security guarantees. The pause on intelligence sharing has left Ukraine&apos;s civilians more vulnerable to deadly Russian aerial attacks. The New York Times (NYT) reported on March 6 that the freeze could affect crucial warnings about incoming Russian drones and missiles. In the days after the freeze went into effect, Russia carried out missile attacks on the cities of Kryvyi Rih and Dopropillia, killing 15 people and injuring over 80. According to Zelensky, Russia launched nearly 1,200 aerial bombs, almost 870 attack drones, and over 80 missiles at Ukraine over the past week. &#xA0; The U.S. has not indicated when it will resume sharing intelligence or providing military aid. The Saudi Arabia talks will be an opportunity for the U.S. to assess Ukraine&apos;s readiness to make concessions to Russia in order to advance a peace deal, U.S. officials told Reuters. Trump told reporters on March 9 that he believes Ukraine will sign a deal on critical minerals with the U.S., but that he also wants to see indications that Kyiv is ready for peace. &quot;They will sign the minerals deal but I want them to want peace ... They haven&apos;t shown it to extent they should,&quot; he said. Zelensky and European leaders have repeatedly stressed the importance of security guarantees backed by U.S. support to ensure the success of any future ceasefire agreement with Russia. The U.S. has not offered to provide any such assurances. In a conciliatory statement issued after the Oval Office meeting, Zelensky reiterated his willingness to work with the U.S. towards a peace agreement. &quot;Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-has-just-about-lifted-pause-on-intelligence-sharing-with-ukraine-trump-tells-media/	2025-03-09T19:34:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203694542.jpg
Ditching Ukraine would 'be worse than Afghanistan,' Republican senator says	The U.S. cannot cut off aid to Ukraine while it fights against Russia, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on March 9. The U.S. froze intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine soon after a heated argument broke out between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House on Feb. 28. U.S. officials have suggested the pause is &quot;temporary,&quot; without indicating when aid will resume. &quot;If we pull the plug on Ukraine, it&apos;d be worse than Afghanistan. I don&apos;t think (Trump) has any desire to do that,&quot; Graham said in a television interview on March 9. Until a ceasefire is reached, the U.S. must continue to assist Ukraine with military aid and intelligence sharing, the U.S. Senator continued. &quot;I am worried about cutting off intelligence and weapons to Ukraine as long as the fighting is going on,&quot; Graham said. The U.S. senator added he will introduce legislation to sanction Russia&apos;s banking and energy sectors &quot;next week&quot; in a bid to bring Moscow to the negotiating table. &quot;If they don&apos;t engage in ceasefire and peace talks with the administration, we should sanction the hell out of them,&quot; Graham said. Trump previously claimed he is considering imposing extensive tariffs and banking sanctions on Russia until a peace agreement is reached. &quot;Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely &apos;pounding&apos; Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large-scale banking sanctions, sanctions, and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and final settlement agreement on peace is reached,&quot; Trump said on March 7. Trump&apos;s administration has faced scrutiny for its mounting hostility towards Ukraine, a longstanding ally, alongside increasingly friendly attitudes toward Russia. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/ditching-ukraine-would-be-worse-than-afghanistan-us-senator-says/	2025-03-09T18:10:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1838188594.jpg
Ukraine 'may not survive,' Trump says	Ukraine &quot;may not survive&quot; Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion with or without American support, U.S. President Donald Trump told the right-wing media outlet Fox News in an interview on March 9. Trump&apos;s administration has faced scrutiny for its decision to stop providing critical military aid and intelligence to Kyiv &#x2014; a move that has been celebrated by the Kremlin. Fox News correspondent Maria Bartiromo questioned Trump about a statement from Polish President Andrezj Duda, who said in a previous interview with Fox that Ukraine would not survive without U.S. support. &quot;Are you comfortable with that? The fact that you walked away, and Ukraine may not survive?&quot; Bartiromo asked. &quot;Well, it may not survive anyway,&quot; Trump said. Trump then pivoted to his preferred talking points on the war in Ukraine &#x2014;&#xA0;the failures of former U.S. President Joe Biden, and Trump&apos;s belief that the war would not have started if he had won the 2020 presidential election. In the same interview, Trump accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of not being grateful for American assistance and claimed that he&apos;d been &quot;tougher&quot; on Russia &quot;than anybody&apos;s ever been.&quot; &#xA0; Trump did not directly address his decision to freeze military aid, nor did he say when or under what conditions the U.S. might resume weapons shipments. The decision to halt aid and intelligence sharing came immediately after the collapse of a natural resources deal between the U.S. and Ukraine, something the White House has touted as an essential way for the U.S. to &quot;recoup&quot; the money it has sent Kyiv throughout the full-scale war. While negotiations have resumed, NBC News reported earlier on March 9 that Trump will not unfreeze military aid even if the deal goes through. Trump wants to see a change in Zelensky&apos;s stance toward peace talks and a willingness to make territorial concessions to Russia, senior officials said. U.S. and Ukrainian delegations are planning to meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 to discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz suggested on March 5 that Trump may lift the pause on military aid once peace negotiations are arranged and confidence-building measures are taken, Reuters reported. Despite its insistence on forging a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, Washington has not agreed to provide Kyiv with any security guarantees following a potential ceasefire. Trump has also previously expressed ambivalence regarding Ukraine&apos;s ongoing sovereignty. In a Feb. 10 interview with Fox News, he said Ukraine &quot;may be Russian someday.&quot; &#xA0;Trump stressed that no matter the war&apos;s outcome, the U.S. wants its money back.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-may-not-survive-trump-says/	2025-03-09T17:47:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201520423.jpg
Nobody has been tougher on Russia,' Trump says	&quot;Nobody has been tougher on Russia,&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump told Fox News on March 9, in repsonse to criticisms that his administration has been friendly to the Kremlin. Trump&apos;s claim comes amid a U.S. freeze on intelligence sharing and military aid to Kyiv, as the full-scale war enters its fourth year and Russian forces intensify their assaults in eastern Ukraine. &quot;I think I&apos;ve been very tough to Russia,&quot; Trump told the right-wing media outlet Fox News in an interview. &quot;Tougher than anybody&apos;s ever been to Russia, if you think about it.&quot; Instead of responding to the current freeze on aid to Kyiv or Washington&apos;s apparent support of Russian demands, Trump focused on his actions during his first term as president. In particular, he repeated his claim that he &quot;stopped&quot; Russia&apos;s construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. During his first term, Trump signed off on a Congressional measure imposing sanctions against any businesses that contributed to the completion of the undersea pipeline, built to funnel Russian gas into Europe. &#xA0; &quot;I&apos;m the one that put sanctions on Russia,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I&apos;m the one that gave the javelins against Russia. I&apos;ve been very tough.&quot; Trump had little to say about the present state of affairs between the U.S., Russia, and Ukraine, though earlier in the interview he accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of not being grateful to the U.S. When asked if he was comfortable with risking Ukraine&apos;s very survival by withdrawing U.S. support, Trump did not give a firm answer. &quot;It may not survive anyway,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/nobody-has-been-tougher-on-russia-trump-says/	2025-03-09T17:03:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/Trump.png
Starlink will 'never' shut off its terminals in Ukraine, Musk says	Starlink will never shut off its satellite internet terminals in Ukraine, U.S. billionaire Elon Musk said in a post to social media on March 9. Previously, European officials voiced concern Starlink could cut off Ukraine&apos;s access to its internet service, which is crucial to the war effort. Musk and top White House officials clashed with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski over the legitimacy of such concerns earlier on March 9. &quot;To be extremely clear, no matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy, Starlink will never turn off its terminals,&quot; Musk said in a post to his social media platform, X. Ukraine&apos;s front line would collapse if it were not for Starlink internet access, Musk claimed, saying that the Russian army can &quot;jam&quot; all other forms of communication. &quot;We would never do such a thing or use it as a bargaining chip,&quot; the tech billionaire said. Poland will look for alternative suppliers if SpaceX turns out to be an unreliable provider of Starlink satellite internet for Ukraine, Sikorski said earlier in the day. His remarks drew swift criticism from Musk and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Sikorski should &quot;say thank you because without Starlink, Ukraine would have lost this war long ago and Russians would be on the border with Poland right now,&quot; Rubio said. &quot;Be quiet, small man. You pay a tiny fraction of the cost,&quot; Musk added to Rubio&apos;s remarks. Poland provides half of Ukraine&apos;s total 42,000 Starlinkk terminals, at a cost of about $50 million per year, according to Sikorski. Fears that Ukraine could lose Starlink access arose after Reuters reported on Feb. 21 that the U.S. had threatened to cut off service if Kyiv did not sign a deal on critical natural resources. Musk has denied these claims.	https://kyivindependent.com/starlink-will-never-shut-off-its-terminals-in-ukraine-musk-says/	2025-03-09T16:18:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1259126916.jpeg
Zelensky not grateful for US aid, Trump claims	U.S. President Donald Trump accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of being ungrateful for American military assistance in an interview with Fox News on March 9. Washington stopped providing military aid and intelligence to Kyiv in the wake of a contentious White House meeting on Feb. 28, during which Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance berated Zelensky for not sufficiently thanking the United States. In an interview with the conservative media outlet Fox News, Trump again lambasted Zelensky&apos;s supposed lack of gratitude and blamed former U.S. President Joe Biden for liberally dispensing funds to Ukraine following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. &quot;(Zelensky) took money out of this country under Biden like candy from a baby,&quot; Trump claimed. &quot;It was so easy. With that same attitude. I just don&apos;t think he&apos;s grateful.&quot; Trump did not say whether or not he would resume U.S. military aid to Ukraine. U.S. officials, including a senior member of the Trump administration, reportedly told NBC News that Trump does not plan to resume aid and intelligence sharing, even if Kyiv and Washington sign a deal on critical minerals. Trump wants to see a change in Zelensky&apos;s approach to peace talks with Russia and a willingness to make concessions &#xA0;&#x2014;&#xA0;including surrendering Russian-occupied territories to Moscow, officials said. Following the Oval Office confrontation and military aid freeze, Zelensky issued a statement expressing his readiness to participate in peace negotiations and &quot;work under President Trump&apos;s strong leadership.&quot; U.S. and Ukrainian delegations are planning to meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 to discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. An agreement betweenthe U.S. and Ukraine on natural resources remains stalled as Trump seeks a &quot;bigger, better deal,&quot; CBS News reported on March 4. In the meantime, the pause on U.S. intelligence sharing has left Ukrainian cities more vulnerable to Russian aerial strikes. The New York Times (NYT) reported on March 6 that the freeze could affect crucial warnings about incoming Russian drones and missiles. In the week following the freeze, Russia has launched deadly missile strikes on Kryvyi Rih and Dopropillia, killing 15 people and injuring over 80.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-not-grateful-for-us-aid-trump-claims/	2025-03-09T15:52:26-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203672195.jpg
Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh wins gold at European Athletics Indoor Championships	Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh claimed the gold medal at the European Athletics Indoor Championships in Apeldoorn, Netherlands, on March 9. Mahuchikh won the competition by clearing 1.99 meters, Suspilne reported. The 23-year-old high jumper won gold at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games in the women&apos;s high jump event following a jump of 2.00 meters on Aug. 4. Mahuchikh, originally from Dnipro, currently holds the world record for women&apos;s high jump at 2.10 meters and was named world champion in the event in August 2023. She also took home the title of Europe&#x2019;s women&apos;s Athlete of the Year at the 2024 European Athletics Golden Tracks Awards ceremony. On March 8, 23-year-old Oleh Doroshchuk also won gold in the men&#x2019;s high jump division of the same competition, by clearing 2.32 meters.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-high-jumper-yaroslava-mahuchikh-wins-gold-at-european-athletics-indoor-championships/	2025-03-09T14:51:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164919585.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Trump won't resume Ukraine military aid after signing minerals deal; Kursk situation 'difficult but under control'	Key developments on March 8-9: U.S. President Donald Trump has privately made it clear to his aides that he will not resume providing military aid and intelligence to Ukraine even if Kyiv and Washington sign a minerals deal, NBC News reported on March 9, citing an unnamed Trump administration official and another American official. U.S. and Ukrainian delegations are planning to meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 to discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. Trump wants to see a change in President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s stance toward peace talks with Russia and a willingness to make concessions such as giving up occupied territories to Russia, the sources told NBC News. The U.S. president also reportedly wants Zelensky to make some steps toward elections in Ukraine and possibly step down. The news comes amid rising tensions between Ukraine and the U.S., as Trump escalates pressure on Zelensky to expedite a peace process. The tensions culminated in a confrontation during a meeting in the White House Oval Office on Feb. 28 after Zelensky had flown to the U.S. to sign a minerals agreement with the U.S. After being insulted by Trump and his Vice President JD Vance, Zelensky returned to Ukraine without signing the deal. Since that meeting, Washington has halted its military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. Previously, Trump called Zelensky a &quot;dictator,&quot; echoing Russian narratives about the democratically elected Ukrainian leader&apos;s legitimacy. Elections are banned in Ukraine during martial law, which has been in force since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Politico reported that Trump&apos;s team has been leading secret talks with former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko and another opposition leader, Yuliia Tymoshenko. The two opposition leaders reportedly tried to position themselves as more flexible partners for the U.S. than Zelensky. Following the Oval Office clash, Zelensky&apos;s approval rating has risen to 68%, according to a poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology published on March 7. Ukrainian troops had repelled an attack by Russian sabotage and assault groups that used a gas pipeline to gain a foothold on the outskirts of Sudzha in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on March 8, releasing footage of the engagement. The announcement came amid reports that Russian forces had made a breakthrough south of the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha and tried to breach the Russia-Ukraine border in Sumy Oblast earlier this week. Ukrainian troops fighting in Kurks Oblast told the Kyiv Independent on March 7 that Russia had destroyed their supply chains for ammunition and food, and they faced encirclement. After Ukrainian airborne assault troops spotted the Russian forces, they launched missile, artillery, and drones to stop the assault, the General Staff said. &quot;At the moment, Russian special forces are being detected, blocked and destroyed. Enemy losses in the Sudzha area are very heavy,&quot; the military claimed on the evening of March 8. 0:00/1:301&#xD7;The footage shared on March 8, 2025, purporting to show Ukrainian forces repelling a Russian attack in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast (Ukraine&apos;s Air Assault Forces/Telegram) Ukrainian troops repelled 44 Russian attacks in Kursk Oblast over the past day, the General Staff said in its latest update on March 9. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The press service for Kursk military command told the Kyiv Independent on March 8 that &quot;the most large-scale&quot; Russian assault operations have occurred in the direction from the settlement of Korenevo toward Sudzha, as well as in the areas of Novoivanovka, Malaya Loknya, and south of Sudzha. The Ukrainian military described the situation as &quot;difficult&quot; but under control, saying that Russia involved North Korean soldiers in the attack. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in August 2024. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, the Russian military claimed. Kyiv has sought to maintain its position in the Russian border region as leverage for possible peace talks. A Ukrainian drone attacked an oil depot in Cheboksary in Russia&apos;s Chuvashia Republic on the morning of March 9, Governor Oleg Nikolaev reported. Russian Telegram channels claimed that this is the first drone attack on Chuvashia since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. The Burevestnik oil depot lies over 900 kilometers (559 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Nikolaev said that the oil depot was under reconstruction. No casualties were reported. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, overnight, Russian air defense shot down 52 drones over Belgorod Oblast, 13 over Lipetsk Oblast, nine over Rostov Oblast, eight over Voronezh Oblast, three over Astrakhan Oblast, one over Ryazan Oblast, one over Kursk Oblast and one over Krashodar Krai. The Russian Telegram channel Astra reported that Ukrainian drones also targeted oil refineries in Lipetsk and Ryazan oblasts. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The Ukrainian military has not commented on Russian reports. Ukraine considers Russian oil facilities to be valid military targets, as fossil fuel profits supply Moscow&apos;s war machine. The Ukrainian military has launched repeated attacks against Russian refineries with long-range drones since 2022. France will provide Ukraine with 195 million euros ($211 million) in military aid using the interest accrued from frozen Russian assets, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu told La Tribune in an interview published March 8. The additional aid &quot;will enable the delivery of 155-mm shells as well as AASM gliding bombs which arm the Ukrainian Mirage 2000s ,&quot; Lecornu said. Lecornu added that France is accelerating the transfer of older equipment to Ukraine, including tanks and armoured vehicles. In October 2024, Group of Seven (G7) countries came to an agreement that pledged to provide Ukraine with almost $50 billion loan backed by the revenue from foreign Russian assets. The announcement from France comes just days after the United Kingdom signed an agreement with Kyiv on March 1 to provide Ukraine with a loan worth 2.26 billion pounds ($2.84 billion) backed by frozen Russian assets. The loan will go towards &quot;purchasing defense equipment according to Ukraine&apos;s needs,&quot; the U.K. Finance Ministry said. While Western countries have frozen $300 billion in Russian assets, they can only access the annual income generated by these funds, approximately $3.2 billion. These profits will back the $50-billion loan to Kyiv, while the vast majority of the assets are frozen in European countries. France, one of Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters, has taken steps alongside the U.K. in recent months to provide European leadership in supporting Ukraine, amid Kyiv&apos;s tumultuous relationship with the Trump administration. Trump has repeatedly called for European countries to step up to support Ukraine, including providing additional aid funding, lambasting the previous Biden administration for sending too much aid funding to the embattled nation. On March 4, Trump halted military aid shipments to Ukraine following a heated exchange with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on March 2 that a number of European nations, including the U.K. and France, are developing a &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; that will include &quot;planes in the air and boots on the ground&quot; in an effort to negotiate a successful ceasefire in Ukraine. Reuters reported on March 6, citing diplomatic sources, that France and the U.K. aim to finalize a peace plan with Ukraine &quot;in days&quot; to present to the United States. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced his delegation to represent Ukraine in upcoming talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia on March 8. Along with Andriy Yermak, Zelensky&apos;s chief of staff, Zelensky wrote on X that Ukraine will also be sending Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Deputy Head of the Presidential Office Pavlo Palisa. Zelensky wrote that he would travel to Saudi Arabia on March 10 and would meet with the Crown Prince, while the Ukrainian military and political delegation would stay for a meeting with the American team the following day. The U.S. delegation will reportedly include U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. The scheduled talks come amid rising tensions between Ukraine and the United States, as U.S. President Donald Trump escalates pressure on Zelensky to expedite a peace process. The tensions culminated in a confrontation during a meeting in the White House Oval Office on Feb. 28 after Zelensky had flown to the U.S. to sign a mineral and natural resources agreement with the U.S. After being insulted by Trump and his Vice President JD Vance, Zelensky returned to Ukraine without signing the deal. Since that meeting, the United States has ended its military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, resulting in significant troop losses on the frontlines. The losses have been particularly sharp in the Kursk region that Ukraine has occupied since August 2024, where ten thousand troops are now facing encirclement. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz suggested on March 5 that Trump may lift the pause on military aid once peace negotiations are arranged and confidence-building measures are taken, Reuters reported. The U.S. continues to share some intelligence with Ukraine to assist with defense operations, but not for attacks on Russian troops, CNN reported on March 7, citing two anonymous defense officials. According to the sources, Washington aims to avoid being seen as directly supporting strikes on Russia. However, the U.S. is not withholding information that could enhance Ukraine&apos;s defensive capabilities. The significant cutting back on U.S. intelligence sharing to Ukraine is part of the Trump administration&#x2019;s position to pressure Kyiv into quick negotiations with Russia. The sources also confirmed that Starlink, which the Ukrainian military relies on, is still operating in Ukraine as before. Starlink is owned by SpaceX, a company belonging to billionaire Elon Musk. Musk, a key ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, has drawn scrutiny at home and abroad over his repeated inflammatory comments regarding Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-62/	2025-03-09T13:12:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/Kurskaja.jpg
Romanian far-right candidate Calin Georgescu barred from running in presidential election	Romania&apos;s electoral bureau has disqualified far-right candidate Calin Georgescu from running in the presidential election re-run, multiple Romanian channels announced on March 9. The bureau noted that the reasoning behind their decision would be posted to their website shortly. The repeat elections are set for May 8 and 22 after the first round in November was annulled due to allegations of Russian interference favoring Georgescu. The Romanian foreign intelligence agency (SIE) reported that &quot;aggressive Russian hybrid attacks, including cyberattacks, information leaks, and sabotage&quot; contributed to Georgescu&apos;s unexpected victory. Georgescu was detained by police on Feb. 26 and charged by prosecutors for alleged crimes related to the country&apos;s recent elections. He filed his candidacy on March 7 in Bucharest, after which the bureau had 48 hours to either approve or deny it. Georgescu&#x2019;s supporters condemned the disqualification move as politically motivated, and several dozen people gathered outside the election bureau, chanting &quot;Freedom&quot;, while briefly attempting to break through the security barrier. The right-wing leader spoke out on X about the bureau&apos;s decision, accusing Romania of being under tyranny. &quot;Europe is now a dictatorship, Romania is under tyranny!&quot; he wrote. Tech billionaire Elon Musk shared multiple posts that were critical about the decision, and commented on it too. &#x201C;This is crazy!&#x201D; Musk wrote. The disqualification can be challenged in court if Georgescu chooses to do so. Georgescu, a pro-Russian candidate has previously referred to Ukraine as a &quot;fictional state.&quot; He has said that if elected president, he would ban Ukrainian grain exports through Romania and halt further military aid to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/romanian-far-right-candidate-calin-georgescu-barred-from-running-in-presidential-election/	2025-03-09T12:15:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2191257472.jpg
Rubio, Musk clash with Polish FM over Starlink in Ukraine, accuse him of 'just making things up'	Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Elon Musk sharply responded to Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski on March 9, dismissing Sikorski&#x2019;s concerns about Starlink being cut off in the future, and urging him to be thankful for the assistance thus far. Earlier on March 9, Sikorski stated that Poland will look for alternative suppliers if SpaceX turns out to be an unreliable provider of Starlink satellite internet for Ukraine. Rubio responded and claimed that Sikorski was &quot;just making things up.&#x201D; &#x201C;No one has made any threats about cutting Ukraine off from Starlink,&#x201D; Rubio said. &#x201C;And say thank you because without Starlink, Ukraine would have lost this war long ago and Russians would be on the border with Poland right now.&quot; Musk responded as well, claiming that Poland only pays a &#x201C;small fraction&#x201D; of the cost for Ukraine&#x2019;s Starlink access, even though Warsaw provides half of the total of Ukraine&#x2019;s 42,000 terminals, at about $50 million per year, according to Sikorski. &#x201C;Be quiet, small man. You pay a tiny fraction of the cost,&#x201D; Musk said. &#x201C;And there is no substitute for Starlink.&#x201D; Previously on March 9, Musk claimed that the entire front line in Ukraine would collapse if he shut off Starlink services. Both Musk and Rubio have made remarks against Ukrainian officials and Kyiv&#x2019;s position in recent weeks. On March 5, Rubio said that Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine is a &quot;proxy war&quot; between Moscow and Washington. He then blamed President Volodymyr Zelensky for &quot;undermining&quot; Trump&apos;s plan in the peace negotiations thus far, following the heated exchange that took place at the White House in late February. Musk has also made similar statements, and he has amplified Russian disinformation, criticizing Zelensky&#x2019;s position frequently, and calling for &#x201C;immediate peace,&#x201D; while refraining from criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin for starting the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/rubio-musk-clash-with-polish-fm-over-starlink-in-ukraine-accuse-him-of-just-making-things-up/	2025-03-09T10:55:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1813800965.jpeg
Poland will seek alternatives if Musk cuts Ukraine's Starlink access, Sikorski says	Poland will look for alternative suppliers if SpaceX turns out to be an unreliable provider of Starlink satellite internet for Ukraine, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said on March 9 in response to tech billionaire Elon Musk&apos;s remarks. Warsaw helps Ukraine maintain its Starlink access, having provided half of the total of the country&apos;s 42,000 terminals. Starlink has played a crucial role in securing communications in wartime Ukraine. Earlier on March 9, Musk claimed that the entire front line in Ukraine would collapse if he shut off Starlink services. Sikorski said that Starlink services for Ukraine are paid for by the Polish Digitization Ministry at the cost of about $50 million per year. &quot;The ethics of threatening the victim of aggression apart, if SpaceX proves to be an unreliable provider we will be forced to look for other suppliers,&quot; he wrote on X. Polish Deputy Prime Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski said on March 5 that cutting Starlink access for Ukraine would lead to an international crisis between Poland and the U.S. If Musk cuts off Ukraine&apos;s Starlink access, Gawkowski said, he would be effectively terminating a corporate contract with a European Union nation. The U.S. has threatened to cut off Ukraine&#x2019;s access to Starlink if Kyiv doesn&#x2019;t agree to a critical minerals deal, Reuters wrote in late February, citing sources. Musk denied these reports back then. The planned signing of the agreement was disrupted after a clash between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. In early March, Washington halted U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing for Ukraine in an attempt to push Kyiv to peace talks with Moscow. As concerns about Starlink&apos;s availability have grown, Ukrainian officials said Kyiv was working on alternatives to the U.S. service. French satellite operator Eutelsat Communications is in talks with the EU to possibly replace Starlink in Ukraine. Musk, who Trump has tasked with eliminating &quot;fraud&quot; and &quot;waste&quot; from the government budget, has called for shutting down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), an organization that provides vital humanitarian aid to Ukraine. He has also amplified Russian disinformation and mocked Zelensky for calling Ukraine an independent country.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-will-seek-alternatives-if-musk-cuts-ukraines-starlink-access-sikorski-says/	2025-03-09T08:43:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202862123.jpg
US Secret Service shoots armed man near White House	U.S. Secret Service officers opened fire on an armed man near the White House in Washington on March 9, the Secret Service reported. At the time of the incident, U.S. President Donald Trump was at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, according to CBS News. Local police shared they received information about a &quot;suicidal individual&quot; possibly traveling from Indiana, in the northeast of the country. The Secret Service members spotted a man and his car not far from the White House around midnight. As the officers approached, he brandished a firearm. An &quot;armed confrontation&quot; followed, with the suspect being shot by Secret Service. He was taken to a local hospital and his condition is unknown. No casualties among the Secret Service employees were reported. Trump was previously targeted in an assassination attempt on July 13 during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. Later in the fall, the U.S. Secret Service opened fire after seeing an armed individual at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, while Trump was playing golf. Trump was unharmed, and the FBI launched the investigation into the incident as another assassination attempt against him.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-secret-service-shoots-armed-man-near-white-house/	2025-03-09T07:50:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2204146985.jpg

Russia, China, Iran to hold joint naval drills in Gulf of Oman	China, Russia, and Iran will hold the Security Belt 2025 joint maritime exercises in the Gulf of Oman this month, the Chinese Defense Ministry announced on March 9. Both China and Iran have supported Russia during its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, helping it sustain its war effort despite the West&apos;s sanctions. The cooperation between these authoritarian regimes appears to continue to deepen as the West is growing more divided due to U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s U-turn in foreign policy. The new drills will start on March 11 in the port of Chabahar, located in southeast Iran, the Tasnim news agency reported. The three countries are planning to practice countering maritime targets, rescue operations, and maneuvering. The exercises are aimed at deepening &quot;the mutual trust and pragmatic cooperation between the participating countries&apos; armies,&quot; the Chinese ministry said. The three countries conducted similar joint naval exercises in the past, including in 2023 and 2024. Beijing has remained a key ally of Moscow throughout the invasion, deepening economic ties and becoming Russia&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods &#x2014; components that are used for manufacturing weapons. Russia has also strengthened its ties with Iran, in particular deepening the level of military cooperation between Moscow and Tehran. Iran has provided Russia with thousands of Shahed attack drones used in attacks against Ukrainian cities.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-china-iran-to-hold-joint-naval-drills-in-gulf-of-oman/	2025-03-09T06:42:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1248343324.jpeg
Trump's betrayal and Europe's response | Ukraine This Week	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration halted U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine as Europe prepares a post-America defense strategy.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-betrayal-and-europes-response-ukraine-this-week/	2025-03-09T06:29:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/IMG_9314.jpg
Russia launched nearly 1,200 bombs, 870 drones, over 80 missiles against Ukraine this week, Zelensky says	Russian forces launched nearly 1,200 aerial bombs, nearly 870 attack drones, and more than 80 missiles of various types against Ukraine this week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on March 9. The weapons that Russia used against Ukraine this week contained more than 82,000 foreign components, Zelensky said. &quot;Every day, we work with our partners to ensure that decisions are made to provide life-saving support: air defense systems, investments in our defense production, and the strengthening of sanctions against Russia,&quot; he added. Russia carried out a large-scale aerial attack overnight on March 7, launching 67 missiles of various types and 194 drones against gas and energy infrastructure across Ukraine. Also this week, Russia struck a hotel in Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, killing six people and injuring over 30 others, including children. Multiple attacks on Dobropillia in Donetsk Oblast late on March 7 killed 11 people and injured almost 50, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. The attacks took place shortly after the U.S. halted its military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv. Experts who spoke to The Kyiv Independent earlier this week said that the main burden of the U.S. intelligence cutoff will be felt by Ukrainian civilians, as it threatens Ukraine&apos;s ability to detect on time Russian aerial strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Ukrainian officials said they are working on alternatives with foreign partners.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launched-nearly-1-200-bombs-870-drones-over-80-missiles-against-ukraine-this-week-zelensky-says/	2025-03-09T05:09:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203966472.jpg
Ukraine releases video of Russian attack via gas pipeline in Kursk Oblast	Ukrainian troops had repelled an attack by Russian sabotage and assault groups that used a gas pipeline to gain a foothold on the outskirts of Sudzha in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on March 8, releasing footage of the engagement. The announcement came amid reports that Russian forces had made a breakthrough south of the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha and tried to breach the Russia-Ukraine border in Sumy Oblast earlier this week. Ukrainian troops fighting in Kurks Oblast told the Kyiv Independent on March 7 that Russia had destroyed their supply chains for ammunition and food, and they faced encirclement. After Ukrainian airborne assault troops spotted the Russian forces, they launched missile, artillery, and drones to stop the assault, the General Staff said. &quot;At the moment, Russian special forces are being detected, blocked and destroyed. Enemy losses in the Sudzha area are very heavy,&quot; the military claimed on the evening of March 8. 0:00/1&#xD7;The footage shared on March 8, 2025, purporting to show Ukrainian forces repelling a Russian attack in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast (Ukraine&apos;s Air Assault Forces/Telegram)Ukrainian troops repelled 44 Russian attacks in Kursk Oblast over the past day, the General Staff said in its latest update on March 9. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The press service for Kursk military command told the Kyiv Independent on March 8 that &quot;the most large-scale&quot; Russian assault operations have occurred in the direction from the settlement of Korenevo toward Sudzha, as well as in the areas of Novoivanovka, Malaya Loknya, and south of Sudzha. The Ukrainian military described the situation as &quot;difficult&quot; but under control, saying that Russia involved North Korean soldiers in the attack. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in August 2024. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, the Russian military claimed. Kyiv has sought to maintain its position in the Russian border region as leverage for possible peace talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-military-releases-video-of-russian-gas-pipeline-attack-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-03-09T04:24:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/--------------2025-03-09-123726.png
Ukrainian front line 'would collapse' if Starlink is turned off, Musk claims	U.S. tech billionaire Elon Musk claimed on March 9 that the entire front line in Ukraine would collapse if he shut off Starlink satellite internet services. Starlink internet terminals have played a crucial role in securing communications in the war in Ukraine. Last year, Ukraine said that approximately 42,000 terminals were in operation across the military, hospitals, businesses, and aid organizations. The U.S. has threatened to cut off Ukraine&#x2019;s access to Starlink if Kyiv doesn&#x2019;t agree to a critical minerals deal, Reuters wrote in late February, citing sources. Musk denied these reports back then. The planned signing of the agreement was disrupted after a clash between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. In early March, Washington halted U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing for Ukraine in an attempt to push Kyiv to peace talks with Moscow. In a post on X, Musk, a close ally of Trump, proposed to impose sanctions &quot;on the top 10 Ukrainian oligarchs, especially the ones with mansions in Monaco.&quot; This was in reaction to a post by Republican Senator Mike Lee, who called for cutting funding for Ukraine. One social media user wrote that Musk ignores the fact that Russia is an aggressor and Ukraine is a victim in the all-out war. &quot;I literally challenged (Russian President Vladimir) Putin to one on one physical combat over Ukraine, and my Starlink system is the backbone of the Ukrainian army. Their entire front line would collapse if I turned it off,&quot; Musk replied. Musk described Russia&apos;s full-scale war as &quot;years of slaughter in a stalemate,&quot; adding that Ukraine would &quot;inevitably lose.&quot; &quot;Anyone who really cares, really thinks, and really understands, wants the meat grinder to stop. Peace now!&quot; he wrote. As concerns about Starlink&apos;s availability escalated, Ukrainian officials said the country was working on alternatives to the U.S. service. French satellite operator Eutelsat Communications is in talks with the European Union to possibly replace Starlink in Ukraine. Musk, who Trump has tasked with eliminating &quot;fraud&quot; and &quot;waste&quot; from the government budget, has called for shutting down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), an organization that provides vital humanitarian aid to Ukraine. He has also amplified Russian disinformation and mocked Zelensky for calling Ukraine an independent country.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-front-line-would-collapse-if-starlink-is-turned-off-musk-claims/	2025-03-09T03:18:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202932520.jpg
Ukrainian drone reportedly attacks oil depot in Russia's Chuvashia for first time	A Ukrainian drone attacked an oil depot in Cheboksary in Russia&apos;s Chuvashia Republic on the morning of March 9, Governor Oleg Nikolaev reported. Russian Telegram channels claimed that this is the first drone attack on Chuvashia since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. The Burevestnik oil depot lies over 900 kilometers (559 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Nikolaev said that the oil depot was under reconstruction. No casualties were reported. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, overnight, Russian air defense shot down 52 drones over Belgorod Oblast, 13 over Lipetsk Oblast, nine over Rostov Oblast, eight over Voronezh Oblast, three over Astrakhan Oblast, one over Ryazan Oblast, one over Kursk Oblast and one over Krashodar Krai. The Russian Telegram channel Astra reported that Ukrainian drones also targeted oil refineries in Lipetsk and Ryazan oblasts. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The Ukrainian military has not commented on Russian reports. Ukraine considers Russian oil facilities to be valid military targets, as fossil fuel profits supply Moscow&apos;s war machine. The Ukrainian military has launched repeated attacks against Russian refineries with long-range drones since 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drone-reportedly-attacks-oil-depot-in-russias-chuvashia-for-first-time/	2025-03-09T01:12:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/Cheboksary__View_of_downtown.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 6, injure 34 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed six people and injured 34 others over the past day, regional authorities said on March 9. Ukrainian forces downed 73 out of the 119 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Thirty-seven drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are usually decoys. Russia launches them alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense. Two people were killed in the cities of Pokrovsk and Siversk in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Another 23 people were injured in the region over the past day. A 41-year-old man was killed as a result of Russian shelling of the Kivsharivka village in Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. A Russian first-person view (FPV) drone attacked a car near the town of Bohokhudiv, injuring a 36-year-old man. Another drone strike injured a 46-year-old man in Kupiansk, Syniehubov said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 40 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Three people were killed, and nine others injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-6-injure-39-over-past-day/	2025-03-09T00:13:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-08_17-17-07.jpg

Ukrainian partisans sabotage railway line in occupied Crimea, group claims	The Atesh partisan group sabotaged a railway line linking parts of occupied Crimea with the front line in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, disrupting Russian supply lines, the group claimed via Telegram on March 9. An operative burned down a relay cabinet near the village of Stolbove in occupied Crimea, Atesh said, posting undated video footage of the alleged sabotage. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the group&apos;s claims. The operation aimed to disrupt Russian military logistics, Atesh reported. The targeted railway connected occupied Crimea with parts of occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast. 0:00/1&#xD7;Purported footage of a sabotage of a railway cabinet relay near the village of Stolbove in occupied Crimea.

(Atesh/Telegram)&quot;Equipment transport via railway is delayed, causing supply issues for the occupiers,&quot; the group said in a statement posted on social media. The Atesh movement regularly commits sabotage attacks on Russian territory and in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine. The group reported a similar action against a railway in occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast on Nov. 16. In October 2024, Russian troops reportedly renewed their attack in the Zaporizhzhia sector. Kyiv previously warned of a potential Russian push in the southern region, just as Moscow&apos;s troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-partisans-sabotage-railway-line-in-occupied-crimea-group-claims/	2025-03-08T21:27:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-08_14-52-05.jpg
US vetos G7 proposal to establish task force on Russia's 'shadow fleet,' Bloomberg reports	The United States vetoed a Group of Seven (G7) proposal to establish a joint task force that would tackle sanctions evasion related to Russia&apos;s &apos;shadow fleet,&apos; Bloomberg reported on March 8. The move aligns with the Trump administration&apos;s efforts to soften its stance on Russia in international institutions as well as in joint statements. Trump, who has called on both Russia and Ukraine to make concessions to end the war, has repeated Kremlin narratives ahead of formalized peace negotiations. The shadow fleet refers to aging and largely uninsured oil tankers that Russia uses to transport oil above the $60 per barrel price cap that the EU, the U.S., and G7 countries imposed in December 2022 as part of the effort to cut Moscow&apos;s fossil fuels revenue. In recent months, shadow fleet vessels have been suspected of sabotage operations in the Baltic Sea, causing major damage to undersea cables. In addition to vetoing the task force, the United States has sought to ease rhetoric used towards Russia, pushing, in a joint G7 draft statement, to remove the word &quot;sanctions,&quot; as well as citing Russia&#x2019;s &quot;ability to maintain its war&quot; in Ukraine by replacing it with &quot;earn revenue,&quot; Bloomberg reported. The final joint statement has not been finalized ahead of next week&apos;s G7 meeting in Canada and is subject to change. The wording in the G7 statement aligns with previous moves by the U.S. at international institutions. On Feb. 24, the day of the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, the U.S. voted against a resolution at the UN General Assembly condemning Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, with 93 countries voting in favor and 18 against. The General Assembly later passed a separate U.S. resolution marking the third anniversary of the invasion. That resolution also received 93 votes in favor but avoided directly calling Russia the aggressor. A few days later, the United States abstained from signing a statement by members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) condemning Russian aggression on Feb. 26, breaking from its Western allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-vetos-proposal-to-establish-g7-task-force-on-russias-shadow-fleet-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-08T20:27:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182537136.jpg
Australia considering joining 'coalition of the willing' for Ukraine amid talks with Starmer	Australia is considering joining the European-led coalition of the willing to support a lasting ceasefire in Ukraine, a statement issued by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Stamer&apos;s office read on March 8. Starmer announced on March 2 that a number of European nations, including the U.K. and France, are developing a &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; that will include &quot;planes in the air and boots on the ground&quot; in an effort to secure a successful ceasefire in Ukraine. Following a phone call with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Starmer&apos;s office said that the U.K. prime minister &quot;welcomed Prime Minister Albanese&#x2019;s commitment to consider contributing to a coalition of the willing for Ukraine.&quot; Responding to reporters questions on March 3, Albanese said Australia was &quot;ready to assist&quot; with &quot;proposals going forward&quot; on Ukraine, hinting that his government would be open to contributing to a joint force. The U.K. and France have spearheaded the idea of deploying European peacekeepers in Ukraine to monitor a potential ceasefire. Despite the progress on talks, Starmer warned that for any coalition to succeed, Europe must &quot;have strong U.S. backing.&quot; Starmer did not specify which other countries would participate in the coalition, but added that &quot;a number of countries have indicated they want to be part of the plan we&apos;re developing.&quot; A U.K. official confirmed on March 6 that talks were being held with about 20 countries consisting of &quot;largely European and Commonwealth partners&quot; &#x2014; without specifying the participants. Thus far, a number of countries have expressed openness to joining the coalition, including Canada, Ireland, and Turkey, among others. The Kremlin has consistently maintained that it will not accept Western troops on the ground in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/australia-considering-joining-coalition-of-the-willing-for-ukraine-following-talks-with-starmer/	2025-03-08T19:07:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1257670533.jpeg
France to provide $211 million in military aid to Ukraine backed by frozen Russian assets	France will provide Ukraine with 195 million euros ($211 million) in military aid using the interest accrued from frozen Russian assets, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu told La Tribune in an interview published March 8. The additional aid &quot;will enable the delivery of 155-mm shells as well as AASM gliding bombs which arm the Ukrainian Mirage 2000s ,&quot; Lecornu said. Lecornu added that France is accelerating the transfer of older equipment to Ukraine, including tanks and armoured vehicles. In October 2024, Group of Seven (G7) countries came to an agreement that pledged to provide Ukraine with almost $50 billion loan backed by the revenue from foreign Russian assets. The announcement from France comes just days after the United Kingdom signed an agreement with Kyiv on March 1 to provide Ukraine with a loan worth 2.26 billion pounds ($2.84 billion) backed by frozen Russian assets. The loan will go towards &quot;purchasing defense equipment according to Ukraine&apos;s needs,&quot; the U.K. Finance Ministry said. While Western countries have frozen $300 billion in Russian assets, they can only access the annual income generated by these funds, approximately $3.2 billion. These profits will back the $50-billion loan to Kyiv, while the vast majority of the assets are frozen in European countries. France, one of Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters, has taken steps alongside the U.K. in recent months to provide European leadership in supporting Ukraine, amid Kyiv&apos;s tumultuous relationship with the Trump administration. Trump has repeatedly called for European countries to step up to support Ukraine, including providing additional aid funding, lambasting the previous Biden administration for sending too much aid funding to the embattled nation. On March 4, Trump halted military aid shipments to Ukraine following a heated exchange with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on March 2 that a number of European nations, including the U.K. and France, are developing a &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; that will include &quot;planes in the air and boots on the ground&quot; in an effort to negotiate a successful ceasefire in Ukraine. Reuters reported on March 6, citing diplomatic sources, that France and the U.K. aim to finalize a peace plan with Ukraine &quot;in days&quot; to present to the United States.	https://kyivindependent.com/france-to-provide-211-million-in-military-aid-to-ukraine-using-interest-from-frozen-russian-assets/	2025-03-08T17:18:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/03/GettyImages-1243421817.jpeg
Dagestan, Chechnya block Telegram messaging app	Authorities in Russia&#x2019;s Dagestan and Chechnya have blocked the Telegram messaging app, Russian state media TASS reported on March 8. The ban was implemented in response to &#x201C;security concerns,&#x201D; as authorities warned that groups could use the app to coordinate unrest. Dagestan&apos;s Minister of Digitalisation, Yuri Gamzatov, pointed to the October 2023 antisemitic riot at Makhachkala airport as an example of Telegram being used to organize violence. Anton Nemkin, a member of Russia&#x2019;s State Duma, argued that Telegram&#x2019;s content moderation is weak, allowing extremist material to spread unchecked. The Russian government has been escalating attempts to control online communications, blocking the messaging app Signal, reportedly planning to block WhatsApp, and curbing access to YouTube. &quot;Telegram needs to reconsider its approach to content moderation,&#x201D; he said. Gamzatov suggested that the app could be unblocked in the future, but encouraged users to switch to other platforms. Dagestan and Chechnya have seen a number of terrorist attacks by members of the Islamic State as well as clashes with security forces over the past years. Both republics are located in the North Caucasus region of Russia. The app, founded by Russian businessman Pavel Durov, was banned from being used by officials of Ukraine&#x2019;s Verkhovna Rada on their work devices in October 2024. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, said in an interview published on Sept. 7 that the app is &quot;harmful&quot; and a &quot;threat to our national security,&quot; following the arrest of Durov in France. He faces 12 charges from the French authorities, including crimes related to child pornography, drug trafficking, money laundering, and withholding crucial information from investigators.	https://kyivindependent.com/dagestan-and-chechnya-block-telegram-messaging-app/	2025-03-08T15:36:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168240257.jpg
Large fire affecting critical infrastructure reported in Zaporizhzhia Oblast following Russian drone attack	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A large fire erupted at a critical infrastructure facility in Zaporizhzhia Oblast following a Russian drone attack, regional Governor Ivan Federov said on March 8. As a result of the strike, gas supplies have been limited in the region, Federov added. Russia has regularly launched missiles targeting various regions of the country. Russian forces have continuously targeted Ukraine&apos;s critical infrastructure as Russia continues to test Ukrainian resolve in the harsh winter months. Amid the U.S. pause on sharing intelligence with Kyiv, the New York Times reported on March 5, citing undisclosed U.S. and Ukrainian officials, that the pause affects warnings against Russian drones and missiles striking Ukrainian military and civilian targets. 0:00/1&#xD7;A fire is shown burning at a critical infrastructure facility in Zaporizhzhia Oblast on March 8, 2025 following a Russian drone attack on the region. (Zaporizhzhia Oblast Military Administration)No information was immediately available on the full extent of the damage, or whether any casualties were sustained in the attack. No details were provided on the location of the facility. Multiple explosions were heard between 10:30 p.m. and 11 p.m. local time, amid the reported threat of Russian drone attacks. Russian forces separately launched missiles towards eastern regions of the country on the evening of March 8. The attack on Zaporizhzhia Oblast comes just one day after Russia launched a mass strike against various regions of Ukraine targeting energy and gas infrastructure across the country. In the attack, Russian missiles struck critical infrastructure in Ternopil, Poltava, and Ivano-Frankivsk oblasts. Zaporizhzhia Oblast, situated on Ukraine&apos;s front line, is the target of near daily Russian drone, missile, and glide bomb attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/large-fire-affecting-critical-infrastructure-reported-in-zaporizhzhia-oblast-following-russian-drone-attack/	2025-03-08T14:27:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-08_17-13-15.jpg
Sweden to allocate $2.2 million in support of Ukrainian women	Sweden will provide over $2 million (22.5 million Swedish kronor) to support Ukrainian women, the Swedish Embassy in Ukraine announced on March 8. According to the embassy&#x2019;s post on X, the funding aims to &#x201C;empower women in Ukraine&#x201D; and support their contributions to the country&#x2019;s defense and recovery. &#x201C;On March 8, we pay tribute to the Ukrainian women who bravely defend their country, and all of Europe, as military and humanitarian workers, entrepreneurs and political leaders,&#x201D; the post said. The funding initiative will be through UN-Women, the embassy added. This comes soon after Sweden announced a military aid package to Ukraine worth over $1.2 billion, on Jan. 30. It was Sweden&apos;s largest tranche of military assistance since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/sweden-to-allocate-2-2-million-in-support-of-ukrainian-women/	2025-03-08T11:27:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2156168873.jpg
Russian troops reportedly attack Sudzha in Kursk Oblast as Ukraine's logistical routes are cut off	Russian and North Korean troops have launched an attack on the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the Ukrainian battlefield monitoring group DeepState and Yury Butusov, chief editor of the news site censor.net, reported on March 8. Multiple Russian pro-war Telegram channels claimed on March 8 that Russian troops have launched a large-scale offensive in Kursk Oblast and are storming Sudzha. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims, and the Ukrainian authorities have not commented on them. Russian forces have recently intensified efforts to break through to Sumy Oblast and cut off logistical routes of the Ukrainian salient in bordering Kursk Oblast. Russian forces have destroyed Ukrainian troops&apos; logistics in Kursk Oblast, and Ukrainian soldiers face the risk of encirclement, a Ukrainian soldier and a medic deployed in the region told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity on March 7. Butusov wrote on Facebook on March 8 that Russian troops had used a gas pipeline to approach Ukrainian positions in Sudzha in Kursk Oblast. He added that the troops are being &quot;liquidated.&quot; DeepState confirmed that Russian troops had tried to attack Sudzha through a pipeline but reported that the results of the operation are unknown. According to DeepState, North Korean troops are rapidly advancing near Sudzha, acting as the main offensive force and also bearing the heaviest casualties. &#x201C;The situation in the buffer zone in Kursk Oblast continues to intensify and requires immediate decisions from the (Ukrainian) command,&#x201D;Butusov said. Kyiv has sought to maintain its position in the Russian border region as leverage for possible peace talks. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, the Russian military claimed.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-soldiers-use-gas-pipeline-to-advance-closer-to-ukrainian-positions-in-sudzha-deepstate-reports/	2025-03-08T09:57:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/Kurskaja.jpg

Zelensky names delegation for meeting with US in Saudi Arabia	President Volodymyr Zelensky announced his delegation to represent Ukraine in upcoming talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia on March 8. Along with Andriy Yermak, Zelensky&apos;s chief of staff, Zelensky wrote on X that Ukraine will also be sending Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, and Deputy Head of the Presidential Office Pavlo Palisa. Zelensky wrote that he would travel to Saudi Arabia on March 10 and would meet with the Crown Prince, while the Ukrainian military and political delegation would stay for a meeting with the American team the following day. The U.S. delegation will reportedly include U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. The scheduled talks come amid rising tensions between Ukraine and the United States, as U.S. President Donald Trump escalates pressure on Zelensky to expedite a peace process. The tensions culminated in a confrontation during a meeting in the White House Oval Office on Feb. 28 after Zelensky had flown to the U.S. to sign an mineral and natural resources agreement with the U.S. After being insulted by Trump and his Vice President JD Vance, Zelensky returned to Ukraine without signing the deal. Since that meeting, the United States has ended its military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, resulting in significant troop losses on the frontlines. The losses have been particularly sharp in the Kursk region that Ukraine has occupied since August 2024, where ten thousand troops are now facing encirclement. U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz suggested on March 5 that Trump may lift the pause on military aid once peace negotiations are arranged and confidence-building measures are taken, Reuters reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-names-delegation-for-meeting-with-u-s-in-saudi-arabia/	2025-03-08T06:46:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164821112.jpg
US to stop participating in future military exercises in Europe, Swedish media reports	The United States has notified its allies that it does not plan to participate in military exercises held in Europe beyond those already scheduled in 2025, Swedish media outlet Expressen reported on March 7. Sources told Expressen that this will affect several exercises currently in the &quot;drawing board&quot; phase that will be held in Sweden. &#xA0; Since his inauguration in January, U.S. President Donald Trump has signaled that he wants to pivot American security priorities away from Europe and focus on China and the Indo-Pacific Region. He shocked allies with recent moves including ending military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, excluding European allies from peace talks held with Russia in Saudia Arabia, and has repeatedly pressuring NATO allies to increase their defense spending. In response, a rattled Europe has begun preparing itself for a world order in which the United States cannot be relied on. EU member states agreed to free up what could amount to an unprecedented 800 billion euros ($867 billion) for defense spending. The United States regularly carries out joint operations with European allies each year to increase cooperation and test troop readiness.	https://kyivindependent.com/u-s-to-stop-participating-in-future-military-exercises-in-europe-swedish-media-reports/	2025-03-08T05:57:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1241165969.jpg
Miniature universes:' The personal spaces of women at war (Photos)	War has long been framed as the domain of men, reinforced by language, imagery, and tradition. But after Russia invaded Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in 2014, Ukrainian women took up arms, proving that in the fight for national sovereignty, it is not gender but loyalty to one&#x2019;s country that defines a soldier. Photographer Marisya Myanovska&#x2019;s series &#x201C;Zone of Seismic Activity&#x201D; captures the role of women in Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces &#x2014; where over 70,000 women now serve today &#x2014; not only through the stark symbols of war, such as unexploded shells and combat uniforms, but also through intimate moments of daily life on the front lines. Her images challenge traditional narratives, revealing the unseen, the overlooked, and the undeniable presence of women in war. On International Women&#x2019;s Day, the Kyiv Independent presents excerpts from Myanovska&#x2019;s photo series to show that Ukrainian women defending their country against Russian aggression are not only counted but seen. A person&#x2019;s personal space is a miniature universe &#x2014; fragile in war, always on the brink of disappearing. Just like the universe itself. - In August 2024, I traveled to the combat zone to document how war reshapes women&apos;s lives. &#xA0; I followed three female service members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kharkiv and Donetsk areas: Oksana &quot;Ksena&quot; Rubanyak, an unmanned aerial vehicles platoon commander; Andriana &quot;Malysh&quot; Arekhta, a weapons operator in a Special Operations Forces unit; and Yulia &quot;Kuba&quot; Sidorova, a combat medic with the 92nd Separate Mechanized Brigade. I slept beside them, brushed my teeth next to them, accompanied them to positions, and shared conversations over coffee. Yet, they rarely spoke of combat, focusing instead on moments when they could simply be themselves. &#xA0; In war, personal space is unstable. Solitude is rare. Boundaries shrink &#x2014; to a car, a sleeping bag, or, if lucky, a restroom, a shower, or a clearing in the forest. The closer to the &quot;zero line,&quot; the more space collapses inward, leaving only the refuge of one&#x2019;s own body. &#xA0; My project explores the fragile personal space of women in war &#x2014; its boundaries, its instability, and its connection to the ever-changing front lines. - Marysia Myanovska	https://kyivindependent.com/beyond-the-battlefield-exploring-womens-personal-spaces-in-ukraines-war-photos/	2025-03-08T05:44:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/updDSCF7439.jpg
Ukrainian drones attacked Russian oil refinery in Leningrad Oblast, military intelligence source says	Drones attacked an oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Leningrad Oblast overnight on March 8 in an operation carried out by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR), a HUR source told the Kyiv Independent. According to the HUR source, the drones attacked the Kirishinefteorgsintez enterprise in the Kirishsky district of Russia&apos;s Leningrad Oblast. Alexander Drozdenko, governor of Leningrad Oblast, said on Telegram that Russian air defense shot down one drone as it was approaching and the other was shot down overhead. &quot;When the debris fell, the external structure of one of the tanks was damaged,&quot; he said, adding that there were no victims. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify either party&apos;s claim. The oil refinery is located more than 800 kilometers from the border of Ukraine and is one of the largest oil refineries in Russia. Ukraine&apos;s ability to strike deep in Russian territory has been threatened by the recent end to military intelligence sharing from the United States. The United States stopped its intelligence sharing on March 5 as U.S. President Donald Trump escalates his pressure on Ukraine ahead of expected peace talks. CNN reported that while some information sharing has continued for defense operations, Washington does not want to be seen as supporting strikes on Russian troops. Ukraine has regularly used long-range drone strikes to target Russia&apos;s oil refinery facilities, as energy exports have been a key source of funding for Russia&apos;s invasion. The attacks have caused some facilities to significantly scale back production.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-attacked-russian-oil-refining-complex-in-leningrad-region-military-intelligence-source-says/	2025-03-08T04:47:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2069256477.jpg
‘Transformations after victory would be too late’ — An interview with Ukraine’s social policy minister	Since Russia began its full-scale invasion more than three years ago, the demands on social services have multiplied. Millions are internally displaced, the number of people with disabilities has risen by 10%, and more than 13,000 children have been orphaned. Populations who were already vulnerable are often hit harder by the burdens of war. At the same time, it has become difficult to provide services in large swathes of the country because of Russian strikes and fighting. The government is facing a budget deficit in the tens of billions as the country covers mounting defense costs to pay for its survival, leaving most social services &#x2014; like other non-defense expenditures &#x2014; to be paid for by international donors. Oksana Zholnovych was appointed Ukraine&#x2019;s social policy minister in July 2022, shortly after the full-scale invasion began. The Kyiv Independent recently spoke with her about how the war has affected her work, what she predicts will be the biggest challenges for the ministry after the war ends, and disability services in Ukraine today. Oksana Zholnovych, Ukraine&#x2019;s social policy minister. (Courtesy)Editor&#x2019;s note: This interview has been translated from Ukrainian and edited for length and clarity. The Kyiv Independent: Can you tell us about how the war changed the work of the Social Policy Ministry? What have been the biggest challenges? Zholnovych: Obviously, the challenges have changed significantly. But the group of people who need support has stayed with us. At the same time, there&#x2019;s a huge number of internally displaced people &#x2014; almost 4 million &#x2014; and the number of people with disabilities has risen by 300,000. We immediately realized that we had to transform almost all of our tools. To expect transformations after victory would be too late; the entire social system would fall to pieces. Everything we are doing now is aimed at radically improving the system and creating new stable mechanisms that will work efficiently and more effectively after the war. The Kyiv Independent: When you think about the future, what do you see as the main post-war focuses that your ministry should be preparing for? Zholnovych: The very first focus is to help people balance their mental health. Each of us is under a lot of stress. Some are fighting, some are waiting for relatives to return from the war, and some have already lost them and live in grief. Some went abroad to protect their family, and they&#x2019;ll return and will need to be reintegrated. Some lost their homes and have been forced to completely rebuild their lives from scratch in a new place. We&#x2019;ve already formed 200 &#x201C;Resilience Centers.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s important for us that in each community, there is this center where people will feel they&#x2019;re not alone. They&#x2019;ll understand how to cope with their pain and will form new support circles. In this way, we strengthen societal cohesion. The second is to work with people with disabilities. Today, unfortunately, only 16% of people (in Ukraine) with disabilities are employed, while in the European Union, it&#x2019;s 50%. More young people have disabilities now. Young, active people who don&#x2019;t want to just receive some small financial support and stay at home. We need to provide them with socialization, work, and employment so that they continue to feel socially engaged. The third focus is demographic strategy. To rebuild, we will need a large number of human hands and resources. We need them now for defense, too. We&#x2019;ve approved a demographic strategy and will implement it step by step in terms of returning Ukrainians, stimulating the birth rate, and improving the lives of our people. The fourth focus is undoubtedly older adults, one of the largest groups. We are an aging nation, and we need to help them have decent lives in retirement. The Kyiv Independent: Have you noticed any changes in the attitudes of Ukrainians towards those with disabilities? Zholnovych: It&apos;s a really complicated process. The most difficult thing is changing stereotypes. On the one hand, we see that people have begun to talk much more about a barrier-free environment, that public institutions should be equipped so that people with disabilities can enter, and that public transport should be available for people with disabilities. But we still see cases when, for example, neighbors oppose building a ramp to a building. There is still a lot of stigma against people with mental disorders. We still have a lot of work to do in this area. But I see very positive trends. For the military, the issue of accessibility and barrier-free environments is critical. They understand that they or their brothers may find themselves in such a situation.

(Chris McGrath/Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: Ukraine has come under criticism by human rights groups for placing orphans and children and adults with disabilities in institutions. One of the requirements for Ukraine&#x2019;s integration into the EU is ending this practice. How is your office handling this issue? Zholnovych: We adopted a resolution (in Nov. 2024) in which we very clearly stated that every child should grow up in a family environment, and that has prompted big changes. It&apos;s not just looking at children who are already in boarding schools and finding them adoptive parents or foster families but also understanding why those children end up there. Prevention is important. Looking at poverty, we&#x2019;ve significantly digitized programs aimed at supporting people in poverty, housing and communal subsidies, and rental subsidies for internally displaced people. And now we&#x2019;re working on creating basic social assistance. We&#x2019;re also improving social support because, in many cases, a social worker is needed to help a family escape poverty. We&#x2019;ve (also) offered a whole range of support for families that have a child with a disability. We&#x2019;re introducing an early intervention service from the first days when it is discovered that a child is disabled, we&#x2019;ve launched a pilot program to expand inclusive education for children with complex disorders who aren&#x2019;t yet covered by education, and we&#x2019;ve introduced a supported accommodation service for those with disabilities who are over 18. We&#x2019;re still working on providing mechanisms so parents understand that if their child has a disability, then their path will be secured, and there&#x2019;s no need to send them to a boarding school. The Kyiv Independent: International adoptions are on hold, but domestic adoptions are still ongoing. What trends has your ministry seen? Zholnovych: This past year, we set a record for children adopted by Ukrainians. There&#x2019;s more empathy. People&#x2019;s desire to provide love to a child who has lost their parents is growing. I consider this our small victory. We also strengthened tools so that children, if they&#x2019;re temporarily removed from their family, even for a short time, don&#x2019;t end up in a boarding school but immediately go to a foster family.

(Ozge Elif Kizil/Anadolu via Getty Images)We added a paid assistant for these families, increased their salaries, and gave them the opportunity to rest, because this wasn&apos;t happening before. We&#x2019;ve already increased the number of foster families by a third. We already have positive results from the actions we&#x2019;ve started, but we&#x2019;re at the beginning of the road. The Kyiv Independent: Since the full-scale invasion, the budget for your ministry has been paid for by international donors. How does that affect your operations? Zholnovych: All the funds we earn as a state, they&#x2019;re all directed to support the military and defense. None of our soldiers are paid for with international expenses. But the social services remain uncovered (by Ukrainian funds). Pensions are provided at the expense of domestic taxpayers because we have a pension fund, but the support of people with disabilities, the low-income, children from orphans, other different types of support, these are international resources. It&#x2019;s very important that the people who help us understand that we are grateful for this support. Without it, a large number of people simply would not be able to survive. We understand that international support is not easy now; there are no additional sources of resources, so our budget is at about the same level as last year. We try to use these resources responsibly, not just consuming them but also using them for transformations &#x2013; to break old, ineffective mechanisms and create new ones that are high-quality and will strengthen our social policy after the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/transformations-after-victory-would-be-too-late-an-interview-with-ukraines-social-policy-minister/	2025-03-08T04:15:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/upd_GettyImages-2123709297.jpg
Ukraine considers Kursk withdrawal amid fears of encirclement of 10,000 troops, Telegraph reports	Ukraine&apos;s forces are considering a withdrawal from Kursk, with 10,000 Ukrainian troops at risk of encirclement after Russia broke through key defense lines and disrupted supply chains, The Telegraph reported on March 8. The Telegraph&apos;s report comes as several recent media reports warn that Ukraine&apos;s occupation of Russian territory in Kursk is increasingly at risk of encirclement after Russian breakthroughs. Ukrainian troops speaking on the condition of anonymity told the Kyiv Independent on March 7 that Russia had destroyed their supply chains for ammunition and food and they faced encirclement. One said the breakthrough happened in the last few days. A source in President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s office told Time that operations in the Kursk region have been most affected by the recent halt in intelligence sharing from the United States. The United States stopped its intelligence sharing on March 5 as U.S. President Donald Trump escalates his pressure on Ukraine ahead of expected peace talks. &#xA0; A withdrawal ahead of peace talks would be a severe blow to Ukraine&apos;s bargaining position. Zelensky has said that Ukraine&apos;s occupation of Kursk is likely to play a crucial role in potential future negotiations. According to the Telegraph, North Korean troops played an important role in the offensive that destroyed supply lines in Kursk. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in August 2024. After a January report that North Korean troops had pulled back, they were reportedly redeployed to Kursk last month. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, capturing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) and marking the first foreign invasion of Russia since World War II. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, the Russian military claimed.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-considers-kursk-withdrawal-amid-fears-of-encirclement-of-10-000-troops-telegraph-reports/	2025-03-08T01:45:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/Kurskaja.jpg
Russian drone strike kills 3 civilians, injures 7 in Kharkiv Oblast	A Russian drone strike on a meat processing plant in Kharkiv Oblast killed three civilians and injured seven others, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said on March 8. A fire broke out on the site after four Shahed drones struck the plant around 2 a.m., Syniehubov wrote on Telegram. The three civilians killed were all men, according to the Telegram post. Overnight, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported 145 drones and decoy drones were launched from Russia. Two ballistic missiles and a cruise missile were also launched. Also overnight, a strike on Donetsk Oblast killed 11 and injured 30 people. A halt on intelligence sharing from the United States has raised fears that Ukraine&apos;s ability to issue vital alerts about incoming Russian and drones may be harmed. However, the U.S. continues to share some intelligence with Ukraine to assist with defense operations, but not for attacks on Russian troops, CNN reported on March 7.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-strike-kills-3-civilians-injures-7-in-kharkiv-oblast/	2025-03-08T00:43:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-08-10_22_47.jpeg
Ukraine destroys 2 diesel trains in Russia, military intelligence source say	Two diesel trains were disabled in Russia as a result of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) operations, a military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on March 8. According to the HUR source, a train being used for transporting weapons and military equipment from Russia to occupied Ukraine was destroyed on the night of March 5-6 in the city of Voronezh. Another train was set on fire early on Feb. 19 the Orekhovo-Zuyevsky district of Moscow&apos;s region. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. Voronezh is located approximately 465 kilometers (289 miles) south of Moscow and around approximately 279 kilometers (173 miles) northeast of Kharkiv. Ukrainian military intelligence and partisans within Russia have claimed responsibility for destruction of Russia trains multiple times in December, including two trains set ablaze near Moscow and the destruction of a train in Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-destroys-two-trains-in-russia-military-intelligence-source-claims/	2025-03-08T00:14:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1237502911.jpg
US shares intelligence with Ukraine for defense, not for attacks on Russian troops, CNN reports	The U.S. continues to share some intelligence with Ukraine to assist with defense operations, but not for attacks on Russian troops, CNN reported on March 7, citing two anonymous defense officials. According to the sources, Washington aims to avoid being seen as directly supporting strikes on Russia. However, the U.S. is not withholding information that could enhance Ukraine&apos;s defensive capabilities. The significant cutting back on U.S. intelligence sharing to Ukraine is part of the Trump administration&#x2019;s position to pressure Kyiv into quick negotiations with Russia. The sources also confirmed that Starlink, which the Ukrainian military relies on, is still operating in Ukraine as before. Starlink is owned by SpaceX, a company belonging to billionaire Elon Musk. Musk, a key ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, has drawn scrutiny at home and abroad over his repeated inflammatory comments regarding Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-continuing-to-share-some-intelligence-with-ukraine-solely-for-defense-purposes-cnn-reports/	2025-03-07T23:41:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2149305400.jpg

Russian national who killed two Ukrainian soldiers in Germany sentenced to life imprisonment	A 58-year-old Russian national has been sentenced to life imprisonment by a Munich court for murdering two Ukrainian soldiers in Germany last year, German television news channel N-Tv reported on March 7. The court ruled that the severity of the crime makes the man unlikely to qualify for early release. The victims, aged 36 and 23, were being treated for war injuries in Murnau, Bavaria. The Russian man admitted to the killings, which happened after an argument about the war broke out at a bar between him and the two soldiers. Due to the argument, the Russian citizen felt &quot;violated in his national pride,&quot; Deutsche Welle reported, citing the Central Office for Combating Extremism and Terrorism of the Munich Public Prosecutor. &quot;Now, in a sober state, I deeply regret what happened,&quot; the 58-year-old suspect said at the start of his trial. There have been multiple instances of crimes against Ukrainian citizens abroad since the start of the full-scale invasion began in 2022. Two Ukrainian basketball players, aged 17 and 18, were killed in Germany on Feb. 2024 after being attacked with knives. In another incident also in early 2024, a 15-year-old Ukrainian boy received severe head injuries and was taken to the hospital after his attacker allegedly made xenophobic remarks before the attack. The boy survived the attack.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-national-who-killed-two-ukrainian-soldiers-in-germany-sentenced-to-life-imprisonment/	2025-03-07T21:22:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1703764954.jpg
Slovakia is Europe' — thousands of protestors take to the streets against Fico's pro-Kremlin agenda	Thousands of protestors gathered on March 7 in more than 40 cities across Slovakia targeting the government of Prime Minister Robert Fico, Slovak media Aktuality reported. In Bratislava&#x2019;s Freedom Square, protesters chanted &#x201C;shame&#x201D; and called Fico a traitor, declaring that &#x201C;Slovakia is Europe.&#x201D; Fico&apos;s government has faced criticism for its perceived alignment with Russian interests, and his administration has repeatedly criticized Western aid to Ukraine. Demonstrators accused Fico of distancing from the European Union, and for strengthening ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. &quot;Robert Fico chose Putin, Slovakia chooses Europe,&quot; the protest organizers said. Protesters also condemned remarks by Fico&#x2019;s chief advisor, Erik Kalinak, who recently suggested that Russia&#x2019;s defeat of Ukraine would give Slovakia a &#x201C;reliable neighbor.&#x201D; Numerous large-scale protests have occurred in Slovakia in the past few months following Fico&#x2019;s remarks and visit in Dec. 2024 with Putin in Moscow.

Poland to introduce large-scale military training for all adult males, PM Tusk announces	Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced plans on March 7 to implement large-scale military training for all adult men to strengthen the country&#x2019;s reserve forces. In a speech to the Sejm, Poland&#x2019;s parliament, he noted that this initiative was in response to growing security threats from Russia. &#x201C;If Ukraine loses the war or if it accepts the terms of peace, armistice, or capitulation in such a way that weakens its sovereignty and makes it easier for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin to gain control over Ukraine, then, without a doubt &#x2014; and we can all agree on that &#x2014; Poland will find itself in a much more difficult geopolitical situation,&#x201D; Tusk said. He also said that he would like to increase the size of the Polish army from the current amount of 200,000 soldiers to 500,000, noting that Russia&#x2019;s army has around 1.3 million soldiers and Ukraine&#x2019;s has around 800,000. &quot;We will try to have a model ready by the end of this year so that every adult male in Poland is trained in the event of war, so that this reserve is comparable and adequate to the potential threats.&quot; Poland has been a key ally of Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, providing extensive military aid, including tanks, heavy equipment, and ammunition.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-to-introduce-large-scale-military-training-for-all-adult-males-pm-tusk-announces/	2025-03-07T18:44:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202961314.jpg
Drones target Bryansk Oblast in overnight attack	Drones have reportedly struck the town of Starodub in Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast in an overnight attack on March 7. Starodub is located about 130 kilometers (80 miles) from the regional capital of Bryansk and about 32 kilometers (20 miles) from the border with Ukraine. Six drones attacked the industrial facility in Starodub, according to local governor Alexander Bogomaz. A military food ration factory was targeted in the overnight attack, local officials claimed. Ukraine&apos;s &quot;Peklo&quot; drones hit the factory, local media reported. Seven explosions were heard and a fire broke out in the military factory following the strikes, locals claimed. &quot;A production facility is on fire on the territory of one of the processing plants. Residents have been evacuated from the nearest houses to ensure safety,&quot; Bogomaz said. Ukraine regularly strikes military targets on Russian territory in an effort to reduce Russia&apos;s fighting power in its war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-target-bryansk-oblast-in-overnight-attack/	2025-03-07T17:44:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1247673607.jpg
Russian attack on Dobropillia in Donetsk Oblast kills 4, injures 18	Russian forces launched multiple strikes on Dobropillia, a city in Donetsk Oblast, late on March 7, resulting in casualties and injuries, according to the head of the Donetsk Regional Military Administration. At least 4 people have been killed and 18 were injured, Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin reported, noting that more people could be trapped under the rubble. Some four apartment buildings have been damaged, the official statement said. Dobropillia is located 94 kilometres north west from Russian-occupied Donetsk, the administrative center of the oblast. First responders have been dispatched to the site of the attack and search and rescue operation continues. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s decision to halt intelligence sharing with Kyiv has sparked concerns in Ukraine that Russian missile strikes could now strike the cities without prior warning. The New York Times reported on March 6 that the freeze on intelligence sharing could hinder vital alerts about incoming Russian drones and missiles. Trump made the announcement amidst a sharp decline in relations between Kyiv and Washington, as he pressures Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to agree to his proposed peace talks with Russia. Shortly after the freeze on March 5, a Russian Iskander ballistic missile struck a hotel in Kryvyi Rih, killing four people and injuring at least 30, hammering home what&apos;s at stake when Russian missiles are not intercepted.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-dobropillia-in-donetsk-oblast-kills-4-injures-18/	2025-03-07T17:02:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1407293310.jpg
Discussions with Trump team currently 'most intensive work to date,' Zelensky says	Work is underway with U.S. officials to &quot;accelerate peace,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an evening address on March 7. Ukrainian and U.S. delegations are preparing to meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days following a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Zelensky that ended in a heated argument on Feb. 28. &quot;The agenda is clear &#x2013; peace as soon as possible, security as reliable as possible. Ukraine is committed to the most constructive approach,&quot; Zelensky said. A minerals deal that was poised to be signed on Feb. 28 is likely among the topics both sides are discussing. &quot;Next week there will be a lot of work here in Europe, with (the U.S.) in Saudi Arabia &#x2013; we are preparing a meeting to accelerate peace and strengthen the foundations of security,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine continues to work with its allies who want to see peace in the embattled nation, the leader added. &quot;Today, throughout the day, the most intensive work to date has been ongoing with President Trump&apos;s team at various levels &#x2013; with many phone calls,&quot; Zelensky said. A White House official on March 3 announced a &#x201C;pause&#x201D; on U.S. weapons aid to Ukraine following the Feb. 28 meeting between Trump and Zelensky. Critics have argued an extended pause in military aid to Ukraine could have a devastating effect on Ukraine&apos;s fight against Russian aggression. &quot;I do not think we should be pausing our efforts. It&#x2019;s the Ukrainians who are shedding blood,&quot; Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee Susan Collins said.	https://kyivindependent.com/discussions-with-trump-team-currently-most-intensive-work-to-date-zelensky-says/	2025-03-07T16:30:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/photo_2024-01-29_14-15-42.jpg
Putin might consider conditional truce in Ukraine, Bloomberg reports	Russian President Vladimir Putin is reportedly considering a truce in Ukraine if certain conditions are respected, Bloomberg reported on March 7. Russian and U.S. officials met in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 for preliminary talks regarding ending Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine and restoring bilateral relations. Russian officials have repeatedly offered ultimatums to Ukraine rather than concessions for negotiations. Russia is open to a temporary peace settlement in Ukraine if progress will be made towards a final peace plan, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter. The Kremlin insists on organizing the framework of a pottential peacekeeping mission in Ukraine. This includes deciding what countries would take part in a peacekeeping force, a person familiar with the topic told Bloomberg. Russia first voiced its openness to a conditional truce at the Saudi Arabia summit on Feb. 18 between top U.S. and Russian officials, various people told Bloomberg asking not to be named. For armed fighting to stop there needs to be a clear understanding of a final peace plan, it&apos;s structure, and its principles, two people with an understanding of the matter said to Blooomberg. On March 4, President Volodymyr Zelensky proposed a truce in the sky and sea as well as prisoner of war (POWs) releases as a first step to establishing peace. U.S. and Ukrainian officials are due to meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days following a White House meeting between Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 28 that ended with a heated arguement between the two leaders. On March 7 Trump said he is considering implementing sweeping sanctions and tariffs against Russia until a ceasefire and peace plan is reached. The U.S. leader also accused Ukraine of being more difficult to deal with than Russia, despite acknowledging &quot;Russia is bombing the hell out of Ukraine.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/conditional-truce-being-considered-by-putin-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-07T15:10:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2161636677.jpg
Voice of America correspondent Ostap Yarysh fired in DOGE crackdown	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Ukrainian correspondent Ostap Yarysh was dismissed from his role at Voice of America (VoA) on March 7 reportedly following a Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) inspection. U.S. billionaire Elon Musk has previously called for the shutdown of U.S.-funded media outlets Radio Free Europe and Voice of America. Yarysh joined the VOA&apos;s Ukrainian service in 2019, covering Donald Trump&apos;s impeachment, the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 presidential election, and its aftermath. Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, he has reported on U.S. military aid to Ukraine. &quot;Word gets around quickly. My friends and family found out before I could even tell them,&quot; Yarysh wrote on social media on March 7. &quot;In short, yes&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve ended (my) cooperation with Voice of America. I&#x2019;ll share more details later,&quot; he added. Yarysh was dismissed from the Voice of America during a DOGE inspection, Head of Detector Media Nataliia Ligachova said. On Feb. 9 Musk called for publically funded media to be &quot;shut down.&quot; &quot;It&#x2019;s just radical left crazy people talking to themselves while torching $1B/year of U.S. taxpayer money,&quot; Musk said. The New York Times reported on Feb. 28 that the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees VoA, launched an investigation into journalists who had spoken out against President Donald Trump&#x2019;s policies. As part of the probe, senior VoA journalist Steve Herman was placed on extended leave. He told the New York Times that he had received a letter saying the investigation was examining whether his &quot;social media activity has undermined VoA&#x2019;s audiences&#x2019; perceptions of the objectivity and/or credibility of VoA and its news operations.&quot; Additionally, anonymous sources told the New York Times that in recent months, VoA had either toned down or entirely withheld coverage that was critical of Trump and his administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/voice-of-america-correspondent-ostap-yarysh-fired-in-doge-crackdown/	2025-03-07T13:31:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/YARYSH-1.jpg
Russia’s history of violating ceasefire agreements in Ukraine	As U.S. President Donald Trump continues to push for a swift end to the war in Ukraine, fears are mounting that Kyiv could be forced to accept a peace deal on unfavorable terms, and that will leave it vulnerable to future Russian attacks. The fears aren&apos;t unfounded. After Russia invaded Ukraine&apos;s east with the use of proxies and annexed Crimea in 2014, Moscow violated multiple ceasefire deals 25 times, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a meeting with Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. &quot;We will not agree to a ceasefire without security guarantees. A document is not enough. We need a strong army. Russian soldiers fear ours, but if we have empty stockpiles, we won&apos;t have anything to defend ourselves with,&quot; Zelensky said. The Trump administration has ramped up the pressure on Ukraine to quickly negotiate an end to the war. But given Russia&apos;s history of violating ceasefire agreements, Zelensky has continued to look for firm guarantees from both the U.S. and European partners to protect against any renewed Russian aggression. &#xA0; &quot;If (Trump) can at least get a ceasefire, then he can claim credit, even if Russia violates it every day and no peace deal is ever agreed,&quot; Jenny Mathers, senior lecturer in the department of international politics at Aberystwyth University, told the Kyiv Independent.But Russia is likely uninterested in a ceasefire, said Stephen Hall, assistant Professor in Russian and post-Soviet politics at the University of Bath. &quot;(It) wants Ukrainian neutrality, &apos;denazification,&apos; and &apos;demilitarization,&apos; and all of these things that they&apos;ve been saying for the last three years.&quot;If it were to agree to any ceasefire in Ukraine through negotiations with Trump, &quot;it will only be to build up their forces and then carry the war on,&quot; Hall said. By launching the war in eastern Ukraine in 2014, Russia first and foremost violated the 1997 Russian-Ukrainian Treaty of Friendship, that &quot;confirmed the inviolability of borders&quot; between the two countries, and according to which Russia was obliged to respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine. After the start of the war in 2014, the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine, which included representatives of Ukraine, Russia, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, was formed. The Normandy Format, which Ukraine, Germany, Russia, and France chaired, was also created at this time. Following the signing of the Minsk Protocol, also known as Minsk-1, a ceasefire began at 6 p.m. on Sept. 5, 2014. The next day, Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council announced that Russian troops had fired at Ukrainian positions at least 10 times after the ceasefire was declared.

(Vasily Maximov/AFP via Getty Images)In February 2015, a document on the implementation of the Minsk agreements, also known as Minsk-2, was signed, which included a ceasefire starting Feb. 15. The agreement lasted only a few minutes, as Russian units fired on a Ukrainian checkpoint near Zolote in Luhansk Oblast, according to Ukraine&apos;s military. Since the signing of the Minsk Agreements, Russia violated the ceasefire several times a year from 2016 to 2022. The two sides tried to conclude truces on more than one Christmas and New Year holidays, the start of the school year, or the harvest. None of them lasted. On July 21, 2019, a &quot;harvest&quot; truce came into effect. Following the start of the ceasefire, one violation occurred when Ukrainian positions were shelled. A year later, a &quot;full and comprehensive ceasefire&quot; was declared in eastern Ukraine on July 27, 2020. Within 30 minutes, Russian forces attacked the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, according to Ukrainian military reports. In October 2020, the number of Russian attacks increased, and an extraordinary meeting of the Trilateral Contact Group was convened. It agreed to extend the &quot;full and comprehensive ceasefire.&quot; The agreement again did not last long. &quot;I will be absolutely flabbergasted if the Russians (conclude a ceasefire) and they actually uphold it,&quot; Hall told the Kyiv Independent. Trump has repeatedly claimed that he wants a swift end to the war between Ukraine and Russia. In the meantime, he has suspended military aid and U.S. intelligence to Ukraine, putting the war-torn country under even greater threat. &quot;The U.S. is taking steps to reduce Ukraine&apos;s capacity to wage war in an effort to persuade Ukraine&apos;s political and military leadership that they have no hope of victory &#x2014; however that might be defined by Kyiv &#x2014; and must instead agree to whatever terms are offered by Russia via Washington,&quot; Mathers said. According to Mathers, Trump is &quot;showing blatant favoritism&quot; to Russia by ruling out Ukraine&apos;s ability to join NATO or revealing his eagerness to restore economic and diplomatic relations with Moscow. &quot;It is pretty clear that if Trump gets his way, Kyiv will feel that it has no choice except to agree to a ceasefire that would, in fact, be a surrender,&quot; Mathers said. Given the uncertainty over further U.S. assistance and potential security guarantees, the Ukrainian government has increasingly called on its European partners to invest in their defense and help Ukraine.

(Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images)The Trump administration&apos;s actions have also forced Europe to review its approach to defense funding. Ursula von der Leyen on March 4 presented the ReArm Europe plan to strengthen Europe&apos;s defense capabilities. The EU agreed to mobilize up to 800 billion euros ($867 billion) for defense spending on March 7. Mark Temnycky, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council&apos;s Eurasia Center, believes that sending European troops to Ukraine could provide the necessary defense against any future Russian attacks. International support for Ukraine&apos;s defense innovation and manufacturing capabilities would also act as a future deterrent, according to Temnycky.	https://kyivindependent.com/neglecting-security-guarantees-trump-fast-tracking-efforts-to-persuade-ukraine-to-ceasefire-with-russia/	2025-03-07T13:25:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1187447613.jpg
‘We will adapt’ — Ukraine’s soldiers say after US intel cut	Days after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a pause in sharing U.S. intelligence, the Ukrainian military has reported little effect from that decision on the front. The pause is likely to have a higher toll on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, experts and military officials say. The U.S. stopped sharing intelligence with Ukraine on March 5, soon after freezing all military assistance in an effort to pressure Kyiv into quick negotiations with Russia. Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, said the Ukrainians had &quot;brought this on themselves,&quot; for not cooperating in peace talks. U.S. aerospace company Maxar Technologies has also reportedly restricted Ukraine&apos;s access to its satellite imagery, according to the Ukrainian media outlet Militarnyi. Ukrainian officials said they are working on alternatives with foreign partners. French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu confirmed that France is continuing to provide its intelligence to Ukraine. &#x201C;There is nothing unique about the United States&#x2019; intelligence capabilities. It is possible to replace them,&#x201D; Mykhailo Samus, military expert and director of the New Geopolitics Research Network, told the Kyiv Independent. A satellite image shows a convoy of Russian troops near Ivankiv, Ukraine, heading toward Kyiv on Feb. 28, 2022. (2022 Maxar Technologies)Effects on battlefieldSeveral soldiers and commanders fighting across the front said that the intelligence cutoff has little to no effect on their battlefield operations. At the tactical level, the Ukrainian army has a range of means to get its own intelligence, mostly from drone surveillance. Other sources include the Ukrainian-made situational awareness system Delta, praised by NATO after testing in 2024, and regular reconnaissance operations. &#x201C;My drones give me the intelligence,&#x201D; said &#x2018;Spys,&#x2019; an artilleryman fighting in Kursk Oblast who is being identified by callsign only for security reasons. According to Samus, American intelligence may have had only a sporadic impact on the frontline. &#x201C;I am convinced that the frontline will cope without intelligence from our U.S. partners,&#x201D; said Yurii Fedorenko, commander of the elite unmanned systems regiment &#x201C;Achilles&#x201D; fighting in Kharkiv Oblast. Yaroslav &quot;Strilok,&quot; a soldier of the Achilles Strike Drone Battalion, carries a first-person view drone at positions near Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast, on Dec. 8, 2025. (Aria Shahrokhshahi/The Kyiv Independent)However, both military and experts agree that &#x201C;there&#x2019;s never too much intel&#x201D; when it comes to battlefield operations. &#x201C;Ukraine has managed to develop the production of intelligence tools that allow us to cover a certain operational depth,&#x201D; Fedorenko said. &#x201C;But in war, it is important to control the enemy at all stages, from production and logistics to the areas of concentration, and then to the front line,&#x201D; he added. Since early 2024, Ukraine has regularly conducted drone strikes deep within Russia and Russian-controlled territories, hitting military and strategic targets such as oil refineries. The strikes have helped to slow down Russia&#x2019;s frontline logistics and reduce Moscow&apos;s gas and oil exports that fuel its war effort. The U.S. intelligence cutoff is unlikely to threaten the planning of those operations by restricting Ukraine&#x2019;s access to satellite images, as &#x201C;Ukraine has its own satellites,&#x201D; Samus said. Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence (HUR) confirmed that Ukraine&#x2019;s crowdfunded satellite had taken over 4,000 images of Russian facilities, used to cause &quot;billions of dollars&quot; in losses to Russia. &#x201C;We still have good intel from our own means,&#x201D; Samus said, &#x201C;And we have (Ukrainian-made) drones that can &#x201C;see&#x201D; at least a couple hundred kilometers deep (into Russia).&#x201D; A soldier who asked for anonymity to discuss sensitive matters told the Kyiv Independent that his unit sometimes seeks intel from HUR, which is consistently better and more up-to-date than the intel available within the Ukrainian Armed Forces. As of this publication, HUR hasn&apos;t responded to a request for comment. The main burn of the intelligence cutoff will be felt by Ukrainian civilians, experts said, as it threatens Ukraine&apos;s ability to detect on time Russian aerial strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. &#x201C;The air defense system does not rely on satellite information, but on information from long-range radars,&#x201C; Viktor Kevliuk, a retired military officer and defense expert, told the Kyiv Independent. Radars are usually turned off to avoid detection by the enemy, he said. But they are turned on to monitor the air situation at long distances when satellites warn of enemy launches of cruise missile carriers or ground- and sea-based ballistic missiles. &#x201C;The U.S. actions deprive the Ukrainian Defense Forces of knowing in advance about the beginning of an air attack,&#x201D; Kevliuk added. The U.S. Airborne Warning &amp; Control System (AWACS) planes used radars that worked 400-500 kilometers deep within Russia, Samus said. He underscored that Ukraine&#x2019;s European partners have the same electronic reconnaissance capabilities and might share this information.

(Vlada Liberova/Libkos via Getty Images)As an alternative, Ukraine can fill up the gap in this intelligence with two Swedish-provided ASC 890 aircraft that were included in a Swedish military aid package for Ukraine last May. &#x201C;They would detect (enemy activity) 300 kilometers into Russian territory, including the activity of Iskander (ballistic missile systems), strategic aviation, and so on,&#x201D; Samus added. A Swedish official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Kyiv Independent that the planes are scheduled to arrive in Ukraine later this year. It leaves concerns about the harm to civilians that Russian attacks could inflict until then. &#x201C;Take the Oreshnik, for example,&#x201D; said Myroslav Hai, an officer in the Ukrainian army. Russia launched its nuclear-capable &#x2018;Oreshnik&#x2019; missile against Ukraine on Nov. 21. &#x201C;U.S. intelligence knows when Russia is planning something very bad for our cities. And if they were to withhold this information, it just means that more Ukrainian civilians will die,&#x201D; Hai told The Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;This is not the first time that the U.S. have taken such steps,&#x201D; Fedorenko said, citing months-long delays in military aid and selective provision of intelligence about Russia in the past. During the full-scale war, Ukraine has managed to overcome many changes and difficulties, and it will adapt to the U.S. intelligence cutoff, soldiers said. &#x201C;We will endure,&#x201D; &#x2018;Bart,&#x2019; a special forces sniper fighting in the Pokrovsk direction who is being identified by callsign only, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Russia is running out of breath here.&#x201D; Ukrainian soldiers of the 93rd Brigade take part in combat drills outside Pokrovsk, Ukraine, on Feb. 13, 2025. (Wolfgang Schwan/Anadolu via Getty Images)The pause in intelligence sharing is just the latest of a series of striking measures taken by the the U.S. administration that are working in Russia&#x2019;s favor, filling Ukrainians with disappointment about its once-ally. &#x201C;It will not surprise me if (Trump) starts giving intelligence to (the Russians),&#x201D; &#x2018;Bart&#x2019; added. &#x201C;(The U.S.) has sided with Russia and are allowing it to use its weapons more effectively,&#x201D; Samus said. &#x201C;They used to be called the leader of the democratic world, but not anymore. Now they are people who make decisions that facilitate war crimes,&#x201D; he added. &#x201D;This is a catastrophe for the United States, not for us.&#x201D; Toma Istomina contributed reporting.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-will-adapt-ukraines-soldiers-say-after-us-intel-cut/	2025-03-07T12:55:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202285720.jpg
Ukraine’s DTEK gas production facilities shut down after Russian attack	Ukrainian energy company DTEK&apos;s gas production facilities in Poltava Oblast were attacked by Russia on the morning of March 7, forcing them to halt operations due to the damage, the company reported. DTEK is Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy company, and its facilities have been repeatedly targeted since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion as Moscow looks to destroy Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure. Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least two people and injured 24 others over the past day, regional officials said on March 7. In Poltava Oblast, debris from a downed aerial target hit a house, injuring two people, including a child, Governor Filip Pronin said. Ukraine&apos;s main gas production facilities are in front-line regions like Kharkiv and Poltava, making them vulnerable to Russian attacks. Strikes on gas infrastructure have repeatedly reduced production, at times by 40%. Before the full-scale war, Ukraine produced 52 million cubic meters of gas daily but needed 110&#x2013;140 million cubic meters in winter, covering the gap from storage. Russian strikes have reduced domestic production, forcing Ukraine to increase imports. In February, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said the country would need at least 1 billion cubic meters of imported gas by the end of 2025. Ukraine imported 560 million cubic meters of gas from Europe in February, nearly matching the total of 700 million cubic meters for the previous heating season. Bloomberg reported on March 4 that Ukraine plans to import 3.5 billion cubic meters for the next winter. Ukraine&apos;s gas import plans come as Europe faces high competition and rising prices while working to replenish low gas reserves. At the start of 2025, Ukraine halted its transit agreement to transport Russian gas to European customers through its pipelines, as the deal expired at the end of 2024 and was not renewed.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-dtek-gas-production-facilities-shut-down-after-russian-attack/	2025-03-07T12:41:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2147953046.jpg
Ukraine signs LNG deal with Poland’s Orlen amid Russian attacks	Ukraine&apos;s largest state-owned energy company, Naftogaz, and Poland&apos;s petroleum refineries company, Orlen, have signed a contract for the supply of approximately 100 million cubic meters (mcm) of liquefied natural gas (LNG), Naftogaz announced on March 7. As Russia continues targeting Ukraine&#x2019;s energy grid&#x2014;specifically its gas infrastructure&#x2014;domestic gas production has declined due to Russian strikes, forcing Ukraine to increase imports. The gas supply agreement was formalized alongside a strategic cooperation document on LNG supply, Naftogaz said. &quot;Partnering with ORLEN strengthens energy security, diversifies supply routes, and accelerates Ukraine&apos;s integration into the European gas market,&quot; said Roman Chumak, CEO of Naftogaz. The gas will come from an LNG shipment delivered to a terminal in Klaipeda, Lithuania. From there, it will be transported through Lithuania and Poland before reaching Ukraine via the Drozdovychi interconnector, where Naftogaz will receive it. Robert Soszynski, vice president of Polish ORLEN, described the cooperation agreement as &quot;mutually beneficial.&quot; &quot;Our relationship will be based on commercial terms, but securing an additional gas source is also crucial for Ukraine&#x2019;s security,&quot; he said. On Feb. 11, Russia launched a combined missile and drone attack on Ukraine, primarily targeting Poltava Oblast and damaging Naftogaz production facilities in the region. Before the full-scale invasion, Ukraine produced 52 million cubic meters (mcm) of gas per day but required 110-140 million mcm in winter, covering the shortfall from storage. Russian attacks have since reduced Ukraine&#x2019;s domestic gas output, increasing its reliance on foreign purchases. Ukraine plans to import about 3.5 billion cubic meters of gas for the upcoming heating season due to ongoing Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure, Bloomberg reported on March 4. At the start of 2025, Ukraine halted its agreement with Russia to transport Russian gas to European customers via Ukrainian pipelines. The deal expired at the end of 2024 and was not renewed.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-signs-lng-deal-with-polands-orlen-amid-russian-attacks/	2025-03-07T12:25:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2147892507.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukrainian troops' logistics in Kursk Oblast destroyed, they face risk of encirclement, sources say	Key developments on March 7: Russian forces have destroyed Ukrainian troops&apos; logistics in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, and Ukrainian soldiers face the risk of encirclement, a Ukrainian soldier and a medic deployed in the region told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity on March 7. The confirmation came after several media reported that Russian forces had made a breakthrough south of the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast. The Ukrainian battlefield monitoring group DeepState has confirmed a push deep into Ukrainian positions toward the Ukrainian state border in Sumy Oblast. A Ukrainian soldier fighting in Kursk Oblast described the situation in the Russian region as &quot;critical,&quot; warning that Ukrainian troops in the region face the threat of encirclement. He added that Ukrainian soldiers based in the region would like to withdraw. According to the source, all bridges in the vicinity of Sudzha have been destroyed, and Ukrainian troops are cut off from ammunition and fuel supplies. The Ukrainian medic stationed in Kursk Oblast told the Kyiv Independent that Russia&apos;s breakthrough happened about three days ago, and Russian troops control all the roads. According to DeepState, &quot;the most critical situation&quot; is on the border of Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast and Ukraine&apos;s Sumy Oblast. Russian troops are trying to push on Ukrainian positions near the villages of Zhuravka and Novenke in Sumy Oblast, DeepState reported. Russia has also intensified its attacks near the village of Kurilovka near the border with Sumy Oblast, some 5 kilometers (3 miles) south of Sudzha, DeepState said in its latest update on March 7. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Earlier in the day, the spokesperson of the Ukrainian group of forces in Kursk Oblast declined to comment on the situation in the Russian region. Russian forces have recently intensified efforts to break through to Sumy Oblast and cut off logistical routes of the Ukrainian salient in bordering Kursk Oblast. Kyiv has sought to maintain its position in the Russian border region as leverage for possible peace talks. Moscow&apos;s troops have almost reached the Ukrainian border south of Ukrainian positions in Sudzha, meaning that at least some areas have been cut off from the main salient, the independent Russian outlet Agentstvo reported on March 7, citing an expert from the Conflict Intelligence Team. &quot;Difficult battles continue in the border area of Sumy Oblast; Russian assault units are attempting to break through and move toward a highway from Yunakivka (in Sumy Oblast) to Sudzha in Kursk Oblast,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. &quot;(Ukraine&apos;s) Defense Forces are fighting and dealing significant casualties to Russian troops,&quot; Kovalenko claimed, without confirming a Russian breakthrough. The prominent Russian pro-war channel Two Majors also reported on the advance, claiming that Moscow&apos;s troops have penetrated up to 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) deep into Ukrainian positions. U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 7 that he is considering imposing sweeping banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until there is a ceasefire and peace agreement. According to Trump, his statement is based on the fact that Russia &quot;is absolutely &#x2018;pounding&#x2019; Ukraine on the battlefield&quot; - a possible reference to Russia&apos;s recent advances in Kursk Oblast or Russia&apos;s large-scale missile and drone attack on Ukraine on March 7. &quot;Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely &apos;pounding&apos; Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large-scale banking sanctions, sanctions, and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and final settlement agreement on peace is reached,&quot; Trump wrote on the Truth Social media platform. &quot;To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late. Thank you!&quot; Shortly after his inauguration, Trump threatened to impose tariffs and sanctions on Russia to force their hand in negotiations, saying &quot;we can do it the easy way or the hard way.&quot; In the following weeks, Trump instead lashed out at Ukraine, claiming President Volodymyr Zelensky was &quot;not ready for peace&quot; and halting military aid to Ukraine and intelligence sharing with Kyiv. U.S. President Donald Trump said at a press briefing on March 7 that he finds it more difficult to deal with Kyiv than with Moscow but admitted that &quot;Russia is bombing the hell out of Ukraine.&quot; When asked during the press briefing why the U.S. wouldn&apos;t provide more air defense to Ukraine instead of halting military aid, Trump replied that he has to know &quot;they want to settle.&quot; &quot;If (the Ukrainians) don&apos;t want to settle, we&apos;re out of there,&quot; he said. &quot;I think he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) is doing what anybody else would do. I think he wants to get (the war) ended, but he&apos;s hitting them harder than ever, which is what anybody would be doing in his place,&quot; Trump added. The U.S. president also said he wants Russia&apos;s full-scale war to end before making any security guarantees to Ukraine. On the contrary, Kyiv insists on security guarantees before reaching a peace deal with Russia. Ukraine&apos;s French-provided Mirage 2000 fighter jets took part in repelling a Russian air attack on Ukraine for the first time on March 7, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Russia launched a large-scale aerial assault overnight, firing 67 missiles of various types and deploying 194 drones. Ukraine&apos;s air defenses intercepted 34 missiles and 100 drones, with anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare systems, and mobile fire groups contributing to the effort. Fighter jets, including F-16s and French Mirage 2000s, were also deployed. Russia targeted energy and gas infrastructure across the country, Ukraine&apos;s Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said. At least two people were injured as a result of the attacks after a Russian missile damaged two residential buildings in Poltava Oblast, injuring one adult and one child. No information was immediately available as to the status of their injuries. Russia initially launched a series of missiles around 4 a.m. local time, targeting various regions in the country&apos;s far west. A second series of missiles entered Ukrainian airspace around 6 a.m. The aftermath of a Russian attack on Ukraine overnight on March 7, 2025. (State Emergency Service)Explosions were reported in the western city of Ternopil around 5 a.m. local time, following the first series of attacks, Suspilne reported. Later in the morning, explosions were heard in the front line city of Kharkiv around 6:30 a.m. Ternopil Oblast Regional Governor Viacheslav Nehoda reported that a critical infrastructure facility in the region had been struck with a Russian missile. Although no injuries were reported, Nehoda added that gas supplies may be interrupted as a result of the attack. Critical infrastructure facilities were also targeted in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, though no damage or casualties were reported, according to Governor Svitlana Onyshchuk. Russia struck already the sixth facility of the DTEK energy company in Odesa Oblast in the past two and a half weeks, the company said. Critical infrastructure facilities were also targeted in Chernihiv Oblast, with at least one of them suffering damage, according to Governor Viacheslav Chaus. Several EU members have pledged to provide up to 15 billion euros ($16.3 billion) in additional aid for Ukraine, European Council President Antonio Costa said at a summit on March 6. EU leaders met in Brussels to discuss plans for boosting Europe&apos;s defense capabilities and support for Ukraine amid the seismic foreign policy shifts in the U.S. Ukraine&apos;s President Volodmyr Zelensky also took part in the meeting. The summit concluded without additional EU aid packages for Ukraine as the discussed 20-billion-euro tranche ($22 billion) was dropped from the final declaration. Kyiv needs more support now than ever, as the Trump administration has frozen all military assistance flowing to the country. As any EU-wide assistance package is under threat of being blocked by Hungary&apos;s Moscow-friendly leader, Viktor Orban, top EU officials suggested that further aid should be provided through a &quot;coalition of the willing.&quot; &quot;Immediately, member states can increase their support thanks to the increased fiscal space,&quot; Costa said at a press conference in Brussels. During the summit, EU leaders unanimously agreed on a new defense initiative that could mobilize up to 800 billion euros ($867 billion) through loans and loosening fiscal rules for government spending. &quot;Several member states have already announced their pledges up to 15 billion euros. Today, we have also tasked the Council to work urgently on further initiatives to address Ukraine&#x2019;s pressing military and defense needs,&quot; Costa said, without naming the countries. &quot;This is a tipping point for Europe.

Republicans urge Trump to resume military, intelligence assistance to Ukraine	Republican lawmakers are calling on President Donald Trump to resume U.S. military and intelligence assistance to Ukraine, the Hill reported on March 7. The Trump administration halted U.S. military aid to Ukraine and intelligence sharing with Kyiv earlier this week following a heated exchange between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28. The decision is intended to put pressure on Zelensky in peace talks with Russia. Shortly after U.S. halted intelligence-sharing, Russia launched another large-scale aerial attack on Ukraine overnight on March 7, launching 67 missiles of various types and 194 drones. Ukraine&apos;s air defenses intercepted 34 missiles and 100 drones, the Air Force said. Republicans say that Trump had the right to temporarily suspend weapons supplies to Kyiv in order to assess the war, put pressure on NATO allies, and to create a window for peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, according to the Hill. But some warned that an excessively long pause in military aid could have a devastating effect on Ukraine&apos;s combat capabilities and undermine its leverage in talks with Moscow. &quot;I do not think we should be pausing our efforts. It&#x2019;s the Ukrainians who are shedding blood,&quot; said Susan Collins, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee. She called the suspension of U.S. military aid a &quot;critical time for Ukraine.&quot; Some Republicans also urged Trump to immediately resume intelligence sharing with Ukraine. John Cornyn, a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that the intelligence that Ukrainians received from the U.S. &quot;has been essential for them to be able to stay in the fight.&quot; Senator Thom Tillis warned that a pause in aid to Ukraine &quot;could be helpful to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,&quot; but he didn&apos;t oppose the stoppage if it was a short-term &quot;negotiating tactic.&quot; Senate Majority Leader John Thune also suggested that a pause in U.S. military aid would be temporary and could be part of talks. The halt in military aid leaves over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition undelivered to Kyiv, while the pause in intelligence sharing affects warnings against Russian drones and missiles striking Ukrainian military and civilian targets, Ukrainian and U.S. officials told the New York Times.	https://kyivindependent.com/republicans-call-on-trump-to/	2025-03-07T11:36:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202741274.jpg
In Kyiv, Trump's intel freeze raises fears of Russian missiles striking without warning	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s decision to pause sharing intelligence with Kyiv has raised fears in major Ukrainian cities that Russian missile attacks could now occur without any warning. &quot;It will be a catastrophe,&quot; Oleh Yeremenov, a fourth-year film directing student, told the Kyiv Independent on the streets of Kyiv on March 6. &quot;If missiles just start hitting out of nowhere&#x2026; people will panic.&quot; According to the New York Times (NYT) on March 6, the intelligence-sharing freeze could affect crucial warnings about incoming Russian drones and missiles. Trump announced the move amid sharply deteriorating relations between Kyiv and Washington, as he strong-arms Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into acquiescing to his plans for peace talks with Russia. Compounding the problem, the U.S. has also frozen military aid to Ukraine, meaning crucial air defense interceptor missiles could be in short supply until it resumes. Oleh Yeremenov, a fourth-year film directing student in Kyiv, Ukraine on March 6, 2025. (The Kyiv Independent) Shortly after the freeze on March 5, a Russian Iskander ballistic missile struck a hotel in Kryvyi Rih, killing four people and injuring at least 30, hammering home what&apos;s at stake when Russian missiles are not intercepted. &quot;They don&apos;t think about the consequences this will have,&quot; &#xA0;Stanislav Khmel, a Kyiv resident who is currently unemployed, said. &quot;I think this will result in more casualties for us, for our people.&quot; In the early hours of March 7, Russia launched a mass aerial attack at civilian energy infrastructure in cities across the country, firing cruise missiles from bomber aircraft, ballistic missiles, as well as nearly 200 kamikaze drones. Ukraine&apos;s air raid alert system, as well as Telegram monitoring channels that the public rely on to know what has been launched and where it is headed, all worked as normal, suggesting Kyiv still has access to intelligence on missiles launched from Russian aircraft. But several successful hits were recorded, with explosions reported in Poltava, Kharkiv, Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Odesa oblasts. With both the military and intelligence freezes still in place, concerns are rising that the death and destruction caused by Russian strikes could worsen significantly. People interviewed by the Kyiv Independent said their lives &#x201C;hinge on&#x201D; accurate air raid threat data, and the timely sounding of alerts. &quot;Maybe I will be the one who won&apos;t have time to react, and a drone will hit me, my building, or the building of my family or friends,&quot; barista Andrii Horbulia &#xA0;said. Despite Zelensky calling the now infamous Oval Office clash with Trump &quot;regrettable&quot; on March 4, and talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials scheduled for next week, there have been no clear signals from the White House about when the intelligence and aid freezes will be lifted. Those who spoke to the Kyiv Independent questioned why the U.S. has made a move that potentially harms civilians so much. Yan Nikuliak, student at Taras Shevchenko University, in Kyiv, Ukraine on March 6, 2025. (The Kyiv Independent) &quot;We just are saving civilian lives (with this intelligence). And if we lose that, then we lose more lives,&quot; Yan Nikuliak, a student at Taras Shevchenko University, said. &quot;Peace will not be attained this way. Never.&quot; Nikuliak&apos;s comments reflect a widespread dismay in Ukraine currently, that they are being punished and bullied into a peace process while nothing is being asked of Moscow. &#x201C;In such a difficult time, this is an incredibly terrible decision that will only lead to a greater genocide of the Ukrainian people,&quot; Daria Pravdyva, a student, said. Daria Pravdyva, a student in Kyiv, Ukraine on March 6, 2025.

You will not attain any semblance of peace in such a way,&quot; he said, adding: &quot; You need to change your ways now, or there will be no people left to actually enjoy the peace you want in Ukraine.&quot; Some of those interviewed expressed hope that European allies would step up in the short term.

But others interviewed were more fatalistic about the threat. &quot;It has been a long time since I came to live with the thought that I might die at any moment. It&apos;s just a thought that is always in the back of my mind,&quot; student Yan Nikuliak said.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-intel-freeze-trump/	2025-03-07T11:32:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2185247530.jpg

Trump accuses Ukraine of being 'more difficult to deal with' than Russia	U.S. President Donald Trump said at a press briefing on March 7 that he finds it more difficult to deal with Kyiv than with Moscow but admitted that &quot;Russia is bombing the hell out of Ukraine.&quot; Earlier in the day, Trump said that he is considering imposing sweeping banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until there is a ceasefire and peace agreement. He added that &quot;Russia is absolutely &apos;pounding&apos; Ukraine on the battlefield right now.&quot; When asked during the press briefing why the U.S. wouldn&apos;t provide more air defense to Ukraine instead of halting military aid, Trump replied that he has to know &quot;they want to settle.&quot; &quot;If (the Ukrainians) don&apos;t want to settle, we&apos;re out of there,&quot; he said. &quot;I think he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) is doing what anybody else would do. I think he wants to get (the war) ended, but he&apos;s hitting them harder than ever, which is what anybody would be doing in his place,&quot; Trump added. The U.S. president also said he wants Russia&apos;s full-scale war to end before making any security guarantees to Ukraine. On the contrary, Kyiv insists on security guarantees before reaching a peace deal with Russia. Trump has long promised to bring about a swift end to Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, though progress towards such a deal was disrupted after he ejected President Volodymyr Zelensky from the White House on Feb. 28 and claimed Ukraine was &quot;not ready for peace.&quot; Following the clash, Trump halted military aid to Ukraine, including intelligence sharing with Kyiv, as part of an effort to pressure Kyiv into quick negotiations with Moscow. U.S. and Ukrainian delegations are planning to meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 to discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement. Meanwhile, Zelensky has proposed a &quot;truce in the sky&quot; banning missiles, long-range drones, and bombs targeting civilian infrastructure, as well as a &quot;truce at sea&quot; as the first steps towards the de-escalation. Trump&apos;s March 7 threat to impose sanctions on Moscow and his statement on Russia &quot;pounding&quot; Ukraine comes amid Russian aerial attacks against Ukraine in recent days. As Russia kept launching drones and missiles at Ukraine, &quot;Trump&apos;s rage has been intensifying,&quot; Axios reported on March 7, citing an unnamed White House official. Russia launched another large-scale aerial attack on Ukraine overnight on March 7, launching 67 missiles of various types and 194 drones. Ukraine&apos;s air defenses intercepted 34 missiles and 100 drones, the Air Force said.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-accuses-kyiv-of-being-more-difficult-to-deal-with-says-russia-bombing-the-hell-out-of-ukraine/	2025-03-07T10:34:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203345473.jpg
How Europe is gearing up for a new world order	In a city usually synonymous with bloated bureaucracy, not all official gatherings are worth the fuss. The emergency EU summit on March 6, however, was one to remember. EU member states agreed to unlock what could amount to an unprecedented 800 billion euros ($867 billion) for defense spending amid mounting signs the U.S. is no longer a reliable ally, and the defense of Ukraine is falling squarely on their shoulders. &quot;Europe is finally waking up and hearing the alarm bells,&quot; one senior European diplomat with knowledge of the discussions told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;These kinds of discussions wouldn&apos;t have happened two or three weeks ago, let alone two or three months ago.&quot; The impetus for the emergency summit were the recent actions of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has become increasingly hostile toward Ukraine and Europe, as he seeks what appears to be a rapprochement with a newly-emboldened Kremlin. Speaking at the summit, European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen summed up the crisis facing Europe, describing it as a &quot;watershed moment&quot; where Europe faces a &quot;clear and present danger.&quot; While the EU is trying to step up to meet the moment, another alliance of nations from Europe and beyond is also taking shape. With the U.S. receding from its role as a guarantor of European security and pulling vital intelligence and military support from Ukraine, Europe is preparing to fend for itself. &quot;It&apos;s like a nightmare we want to wake up from,&quot; an EU official told the Kyiv Independent at the Brussels summit. The Trump administration&apos;s about-turn away from more than eighty years of U.S. global leadership has prompted the outline for a new alliance of nations to secure peace for Ukraine and Europe. Led by France and the U.K., the so-called &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; could be made up of a mix of EU states, other European countries, and like-minded partners including Canada and Australia. &quot;The wider the better&quot; said the EU official, &quot;if we can count on Norway and the U.K., why not?&quot; they added, in a sign that Brexit now appears to be a distant memory.

(Nicolas Tucat/AFP via Getty Images)Paris has proposed a path to peace that would start with a one-month truce in the air and at sea. French President Emmanuel Macron said this would give Russia a chance to prove it is serious about peace. Crucially, this plan also received support from President Volodymyr Zelensky at the meeting of EU leaders on March 6 &#x2014; paving the way for a wider plan to be formulated with the help from U.K. and Ukraine which will then be presented to the U.S. and, eventually, Russia. But how any peace deal might be enforced remains a topic of debate among coalition leaders. &quot;There is no problem finding willing countries, the problem is figuring out what and how to enforce,&quot; another senior EU diplomat told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Discussions won&apos;t be concrete until we know what there is to enforce.&quot; Coalition countries have so far pledged varying levels of support to a future peacekeeping force for Ukraine. Speaking at a press conference alongside U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 27, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that together, the countries were &quot;ready to support Ukraine with troops on the ground and planes in the air.&quot; The U.K. and France have clearly said they would send troops to Ukraine to uphold a peace deal. Around ten other countries, including Spain, Portugal, Australia, Denmark, Canada, and Turkey, said they could be open to sending peacekeepers, while others, including the Netherlands and Ireland, committed logistical and technological support to the plan. New steps to support Ukraine have already been taken in the short term &#x2014; Norway announced it would more than double its support this year, the U.K. will give Ukraine an additional $2 billion for air defense, and Franco-British Starlink competitor Eutelsat is in discussions with Ukraine on reducing its dependence on Elon Musk&apos;s technology. The next step will be a meeting next week, convened in Paris by President Macron, of military chiefs from countries willing to commit troops to enforce peace in Ukraine in an effort to coordinate and draw up a potential peacekeeping mission. The EU, for its part, does not have authority or responsibility over defense, but it can provide financial assistance. EU leaders&apos; meeting in Brussels on March 6 took steps towards a dramatic long-term transformation of European defense, pledging to &quot;substantially increase expenditure on Europe&apos;s security and defense&quot; and tasking the European Commission to find more money and more financial tools to help member states quickly ramp up military spending. &quot;Russia is leading a hybrid war against our democracies. It seeks to uproot the world we have, a world of peace which we built since the end of the Cold War,&quot; French Europe Minister Benjamin Haddad told the Kyiv Independent at the meeting. &quot;We will define the areas in which we&apos;re lacking, be it ammunition, drones, or cyber, and then figure out common European financing to support member states in making those investments,&quot; he added. One of the ways it plans to support this surge in defense spending is through a 150 billion euro ($162 billion) fund from which member states can borrow money to spend on collective European defense, or to support Ukraine. The leaders also endorsed another crucial step for the EU &#x2014; getting out of the way. The bloc will loosen its debt rules, allowing member states to dramatically increase their defense spending by borrowing more. Should all EU states decide to ramp up defense spending by 1.5% of GDP on average, these new rules could mean an additional 650 billion euros ($705 billion) spent on defense in the EU over four years. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk didn&apos;t mince his words on the sense of urgency. &quot;There is no doubt that the war in Ukraine, the new approach of the American administration to Europe, and the arms race started by Russia pose completely new challenges to us,&quot; Tusk told reporters at the meeting. &quot;Europe must join this arms race and win it.&quot; EU leaders also made another significant move highlighting this new sense of urgency &#x2014; ignoring Hungary. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban chose not to support the bloc&apos;s statement of intent on continued support for Ukraine on the battlefield, in peace talks, and beyond. Rather than trying to convince Orban, the 26 other EU leaders decided to crack on without him. &quot;Hungary has always made things difficult; it&apos;s good that the rest said, &apos;We don&apos;t buy it; you go your own way.&apos; It&apos;s just more pragmatic to ignore Prime Minister Orban,&quot; the EU diplomat said. That sentiment was echoed by European Council President Antonio Costa. &quot;Hungary is isolated,&quot; he said at the end of the meeting. &quot;We respect Hungary&apos;s position, but it&apos;s one of 27. And 26 are more than one.&quot; (L-R) Cyprus&apos; President Nikos Christodoulides speaks with Hungary&apos;s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, EU Commission Vice-President Kaja Kallas, and Poland&apos;s Prime Minister Donald Tusk before an EU summit in Brussels, Belgium, on March 6, 2025. (Thierry Monasse/Getty Images)The Hungarian leader lashed out after the meeting, aligning himself with Trump and accusing other EU leaders of wanting to &quot;continue the war (in Ukraine) as long as it takes.&quot; This sets up another clash between Budapest and the 26 other member states in the coming weeks. Not having Hungary on board at this meeting made little practical difference, but upcoming debates about renewing sanctions against Russia, continuing to freeze Russian assets, or new support packages for Ukraine could still see Hungary grinding the EU to a halt. That, and the fact the EU is fundamentally not designed to tackle defense issues, means the future of European military rearmament, and Ukrainian survival, will rely on the commitment of individual EU countries, and allies further afield. In a clear sign of the importance of these new partnerships, the presidents of the European Commission and European Council, as well as the EU&apos;s top diplomat Kaja Kallas, convened a video call with the leaders of the U.K., Turkey, Canada, Norway, and Iceland to debrief them on the EU&apos;s new plans. As Europe gears up for this new reality, EU officials speaking to the Kyiv Independent were stoic, &quot;The spirit of our discussions is that Europe will have to go it alone. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/how-europe-is-gearing-up-for-a-new-world-order/	2025-03-07T10:15:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202965061.jpg
Belarus Weekly: Belarus, Russia ratify security pact, expanding nuclear umbrella, military integration	Belarus and Russia ratified the Union State Security Pact, expanding the nuclear umbrella and military integration. Belarusian dictator Aleksandr Lukashenko invites U.S President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and Russian President Vladimir Putin to Minsk for peace talks. Belarus criminalizes sharing information on military movements and expands in absentia prosecution of exiled opponents. Local media reported that a stray drone crashed into power lines in Belarus, causing outages in Mazyr. Belarus hits record low in the Freedom House report, ranking 192-194 out of 207 globally. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko have concluded the ratification of the Union State security guarantees, expanding Russia&#x2019;s nuclear umbrella over Belarus and deepening the military integration of the two countries. The Union State security pact was signed on Dec. 6, stipulating that Russian nuclear weapons can be used against an aggressor state &#x2014; even ones that don&#x2019;t have nuclear weapons themselves. Putin signed the law ratifying the agreement on Feb. 28, after speedy consideration in Russia&#x2019;s State Duma in February. Belarus&#x2019;s Lukashenko signed the ratification law on March 4, his press office reported. The pact will enter into force after the sides exchange ratification documents. The security pact signing comes on the same day the Russian parliament ratified another agreement postponing Belarus&#x2019;s repayment of about $800 million in Russian state loans. Opposition politician Pavel Latushka, formerly an official in the Belarusian foreign ministry, linked the two ratifications. &#x201C;Lukashenko got himself into debt with Russia, and now he&#x2019;s paying with the country&#x2019;s national sovereignty,&#x201D; Latushka said. Beyond expanding the Russian &#x201C;nuclear umbrella&#x201D; to cover Belarus, Article 5 of the agreement provides for the establishment of Russian military bases and stationing of Russian troops on the territory of Belarus &#x201C;to prevent and repel acts of aggression.&#x201D; However, the implementation of this provision would require a separate agreement between Minsk and Moscow. Russia has been pushing to establish an air base in Belarus since 2015. The treaty also obliges the parties to &#x201C;support&#x201D; each other in the event of a threat to their constitutional orders &#x2014; allowing each to potentially intervene to suppress public protests in either of the two countries. The Union State security agreement lasts for ten years and is automatically extended, unless one of the parties declares its intention to withdraw six months in advance. According to NATO estimates, Belarus hosted up to 30,000 Russian troops in the buildup to the Russian attack on Kyiv in February-March 2022, in the pretense that they were taking part in the &#x201C;Union Determination-2022&#x201D; military drills. Following Russian forces&#x2019; withdrawal from the northern front, the number of Russian troops in Belarus gradually fell, with just about 2,000 soldiers now being left, according to the Belarusian Hajun monitoring project. In September 2025, Belarus is to host up to 13,000 troops for the Zapad-2025 (West-2025) exercises. The Russian-Belarusian plans to hold the exercises have sparked concern among Ukrainian officials. Minsk is prepared to host the leaders of the United States, Ukraine, and Russia for talks on ending Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, Lukashenko, a staunch Moscow ally, said in an interview on March 4. Lukashenko&#x2019;s remarks came shortly after the United States imposed an immediate freeze on military aid to Ukraine, in a move the White House claimed was meant to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into entering peace negotiations. In an interview with U.S. Internet media personality Mario Nawfal, Lukashenko reiterated his praise for U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he was willing to help achieve his goal of brokering peace between Kyiv and Moscow. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s only 200 kilometers from the Belarusian border to Kyiv &#x2013; half an hour by plane,&#x201D; Lukashenko told Nawfal. &quot;You are welcome to come. We will sit down here. We&#x2019;ll come to an agreement quietly, without noise, without shouting. So tell Trump: I&#x2019;m waiting for him here, along with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and Zelensky. We&#x2019;ll sit down and calmly negotiate. If you want to make a deal.&#x201D; The Kremlin has already backed the proposal. &#x201C;This issue has not been raised or discussed in any way. But, of course, Minsk is the best place for us. It is our main ally, so it is the best place for negotiations,&#x201D; Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. In the early days of Russia&#x2019;s all-out invasion, negotiations between Ukraine and Russia were held in Belarus but were later moved to Istanbul. Minsk has repeatedly attempted to get a seat at the negotiating table, at the same time requiring &#x201C;security guarantees&#x201D; for itself. Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhiy Tykhyi said, &#x201C;Belarusian officials have the right to claim a fair hearing in the process of bringing the aggressor and his accomplices to international legal responsibility for the crime of aggression against Ukraine.&#x201D; Belarus previously hosted talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in 2014 and 2015, which led to the signing of the Minsk Agreements. The agreements were meant to stop Russia&#x2019;s war in eastern Ukraine, but both of the documents were ultimately violated by Russia. Two days before launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Putin declared that the Minsk Agreements &#x201C;no longer existed.&#x201D; Lukashenko has been trying to make himself noticed by Trump, rushing to congratulate him on winning the U.S. presidential elections even before the results were confirmed, and promising to nominate President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Following the failure of the rare earth metals deal with Ukraine on Feb. 28, Lukashenko ordered his ministers to look into the issue of mining rare earth metals in Belarus. Updates to the criminal code in Belarus have introduced prison sentences of up to three years for the &#x201C;unauthorized sharing of information&#x201D; about the deployment of military units and their movement within the country, Human Rights watchdog Viasna reported on Feb. 28. The changes to the code also broaden the category of offenses that can be subject to in absentia prosecution. Since Russia unleashed its all-out invasion of Ukraine, Belarusians have been reporting the movement of Russian troops, and sharing footage and information on Russian troop locations with independent media and open-source intelligence projects. Ninety-three Belarusians have been sentenced on &#x201C;extremism&#x201D; charges for doing so. The updated criminal code, which entered into effect on March 2, essentially outlaws sharing any form of content featuring the military in Belarus during wartime, emergencies, or counter-terrorist operations &#x2014; unless the authorities have already shared such information. Violations are punishable by up to three years of imprisonment, or six years, if premeditated and committed by a group, and causing significant damage, the amended code reads. The updated criminal code also introduces the new status of &#x201C;a president who ceased to fulfill his duties&#x201D; and criminalizes violence, threats, and libel against him. According to the current constitution, the incumbent, Alexander Lukashenko, can be &#x201C;re-elected&#x201D; once more and rule until 2035. Although there are no apparent signs of an impending transition of power, the Belarusian authorities have established an extra-governmental body &#x2014; the All-Belarus People&#x2019;s Assembly, which is headed by Lukashenko &#x2014; to which the dictator could &#x201C;retire&#x201D; after leaving the presidency, while still wielding considerable influence. A stray Russian attack drone crashed into high-voltage power grid lines at a thermal power plant on Feb. 27, causing the most significant damage by a drone in Belarus so far, Flagshtok, a local news outlet in the Homiel region, has reported. Russian drone incursions into the Belarusian airspace have risen sharply since July 2024. At least 395 drones were recorded flying over the country in the second half of the year, and this year 94 were spotted in January alone. The Belarusian authorities don&#x2019;t comment on the incidents, and never publicly objected to them with their ally &#x2013; Moscow. On the morning of Feb. 27, residents of Mazyr, Homiel Oblast, about 45 kilometers from the border with Ukraine, were cut off from heating and hot water supplies. Local state energy company Homielenergo attributed the problem to a breakdown in the rather old heat supply system, without elaborating on the cause. Heating and hot water supplies were restored after a full day of repair work. According to Flagshtok&#x2019;s sources, the drone crashed into the high-voltage lines of a thermal power plant, triggering its automatic protection system, which led to a full shutdown of the plant, which is located south of the Mazyr Oil Refinery &#x2014; a strategic object reportedly protected by Belarusian air defenses. Restarting the plant caused a fault in the piping system. On the same night, another drone crashed and set fire to a farm building in Ziabrauka, a village next to a military airfield in the Homiel Oblast. Residents reported the sound of gunfire and a blast at around 4 a.m. Belarus ranked 192-194th out of 207 countries and territories worldwide on the level of political and civil liberties, according to global human rights watchdog Freedom House&#x2019;s Freedom in the World report, which was published on Feb. 26. The Freedom in the World report, first published in 1973, tracks the condition of political rights and civil liberties around the globe. According to its authors, global freedom declined in 2024 for the 19th consecutive year, and Belarus received some of the &#x201C;worst aggregate scores&#x201D; for political rights and civil liberties. The country scored just seven points out of 100, sharing its position with Azerbaijan and Myanmar. Hundreds of Belarus opposition supporters take part in a march in Warsaw, Poland on Jan. 25, 2025.

According to the recent estimates by Belarusian opposition People&#x2019;s Anti-Crisis Management initiative, up to 3,500 Ukrainian children from Russia-occupied Ukrainian territories were transported to Belarus. Belarus is also one of the most repressive countries for lawyers. Over the past four years, up to 27% of Belarusian lawyers were disbarred or lost their licenses after representing political prisoners in courts, U.S. government-funded broadcaster RFE/RL reported, citing the International Observatory of Lawyers.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-belarus-russia-ratify-security-pact-expanding-nuclear-umbrella-military-integration/	2025-03-07T09:36:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2190761497.jpg
Ukrainian troops' logistics in Kursk Oblast destroyed, they face risk of encirclement, sources say	Russian forces have destroyed Ukrainian troops&apos; logistics in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, and Ukrainian soldiers face the risk of encirclement, a Ukrainian soldier and a medic deployed in the region told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity on March 7. The confirmation came after several media reported that Russian forces had made a breakthrough south of the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast. The Ukrainian battlefield monitoring group DeepState has confirmed a push deep into Ukrainian positions toward the Ukrainian state border in Sumy Oblast. A Ukrainian soldier fighting in Kursk Oblast described the situation in the Russian region as &quot;critical,&quot; warning that Ukrainian troops in the region face the threat of encirclement. He added that Ukrainian soldiers based in the region would like to withdraw. According to the source, all bridges in the vicinity of Sudzha have been destroyed, and Ukrainian troops are cut off from ammunition and fuel supplies. The Ukrainian medic stationed in Kursk Oblast told the Kyiv Independent that Russia&apos;s breakthrough happened about three days ago, and Russian troops control all the roads. According to DeepState, &quot;the most critical situation&quot; is on the border of Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast and Ukraine&apos;s Sumy Oblast. Russian troops are trying to push on Ukrainian positions near the villages of Zhuravka and Novenke in Sumy Oblast, DeepState reported. Russia has also intensified its attacks near the village of Kurilovka near the border with Sumy Oblast, some 5 kilometers (3 miles) south of Sudzha, DeepState said in its latest update on March 7. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Earlier in the day, the spokesperson of the Ukrainian group of forces in Kursk Oblast declined to comment on the situation in the Russian region. Russian forces have recently intensified efforts to break through to Sumy Oblast and cut off logistical routes of the Ukrainian salient in bordering Kursk Oblast. Kyiv has sought to maintain its position in the Russian border region as leverage for possible peace talks. Moscow&apos;s troops have almost reached the Ukrainian border south of Ukrainian positions in Sudzha, meaning that at least some areas have been cut off from the main salient, the independent Russian outlet Agentstvo reported on March 7, citing an expert from the Conflict Intelligence Team. &quot;Difficult battles continue in the border area of Sumy Oblast; Russian assault units are attempting to break through and move toward a highway from Yunakivka (in Sumy Oblast) to Sudzha in Kursk Oblast,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. &quot;(Ukraine&apos;s) Defense Forces are fighting and dealing significant casualties to Russian troops,&quot; Kovalenko claimed, without confirming a Russian breakthrough. The prominent Russian pro-war channel Two Majors also reported on the advance, claiming that Moscow&apos;s troops have penetrated up to 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) deep into Ukrainian positions. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, the Russian military claimed.	https://kyivindependent.com/logistics-is-gone-russia-breaches-ukrainian-positions-in-kursk-oblast-sources-confirm/	2025-03-07T09:30:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166312696.jpg
Trump's increasing support for Russia leaves Zelensky with fewer options to secure U.S. backing	As Washington continues to pressure Kyiv intro submission, President Volodymyr Zelensky stands at a painful crossroads &#x2014; agree to U.S. demands or chart a course without Washington, pinning Ukraine&apos;s hopes for survival on Europe alone. Neither option seems reassuring for Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s constant verbal attacks against Zelensky and Ukraine and the halt in U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv have brought U.S.-Ukrainian relations to a record low. In the most recent blow, U.S. aerospace company Maxar Technologies has allegedly restricted Ukraine&apos;s access to its satellite imagery. Kyiv has relied on high-resolution satellite images for defense and strategic planning, tracking Russian troop movements, assessing battlefield conditions, and monitoring Russian infrastructure damage. With the U.S. actively obstructing Kyiv&apos;s ability to defend against Russia, European leaders have promised to fill the gap and step up their support for Ukraine. Despite that, analysts say Washington&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s war effort remains crucial, and Europe cannot fully replace the U.S. in the near future. Zelensky has attempted to slow down the U.S. pivot toward Russia, praising Trump&apos;s leadership and reiterating Ukraine&apos;s commitment to peace in a March 4 statement. The U.S. and Ukraine have scheduled a round of talks on ending the war with Russia in Saudi Arabia for next week. Yet, the U.S. has not resumed its military aid or intelligence cooperation, and U.S. officials have continued to verbally attack Ukraine. &quot;It is impossible to know Trump&apos;s mind, which in any event often changes,&quot; Roland Paris, a professor of international affairs at the University of Ottawa, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We can only judge his actions. To date, he has brought U.S. policy on Ukraine into alignment with that of Russia. Unless there is genuine pushback in the United States against this remarkable turnabout in U.S. policy, I would expect Trump to continue on the path he has already been following.&quot; As Trump is increasingly siding with Russia on all major issues, Zelensky may be tempted to break relations with the U.S. and rely exclusively on Europe. Following an emergency summit on March 6, the EU agreed to mobilize up to 800 billion euros ($867 billion) for defense spending amid fears that the U.S. might scale down its presence on the continent. The ReArm Europe initiative, proposed by the European Commission, includes a 150-billion-euro loan ($162 billion) covered by unused budget funds and a step to loosen fiscal rules and free up 600 billion euros ($650 billion) in government spending. But analysts say that relying only on Europe would be a very risky option. &quot;This would be a real disaster,&quot; Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We need Europe in the negotiation process for balance, but severing relations with the U.S. is dangerous for us.&quot; He said that Ukraine still depends on U.S. military aid, including Patriot air defense systems, reconnaissance satellites, and intelligence data, none of which Ukraine is receiving at the moment. &quot;If we go into conflict with the Americans, we will be pushing them toward closer ties with Russia,&quot; Fesenko added. U.S. President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S. on March 4, 2025. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)If there is a conflict with the U.S., Washington may block not only free-of-charge aid but also the sale of U.S. weapons to Ukraine, as well as exert economic pressure and impose sanctions on Kyiv, Fesenko said. William Wohlforth, a professor focusing on international relations at Dartmouth College, also said that &quot;repairing relations with the Trump administration is a priority because, even if Washington does not provide direct assistance to Ukraine in the near term, its indirect help is needed even if European states take the lead.&quot; &quot;If it has the political will, Europe is probably capable of providing a multinational military force to help secure Ukraine in event of a ceasefire,&quot; he added. &quot;But I doubt very much that is possible without all sorts of U.S. indirect assistance: intelligence, logistics, organization. It makes sense for Ukraine to push for this European role but not in a way that suggests antagonism to the U.S.&quot; Charly Salonius-Pasternak, lead researcher at the Center on U.S. Politics and Power at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, said that it might be possible for Ukraine to rely exclusively on Europe&apos;s support in the long term. But it&apos;s impossible in the short run, he added. Experts say that, to improve relations with the U.S., Zelensky should be more subtle in his relations with Trump and focus on practical issues rather than rhetoric. &quot;What Zelensky and Ukrainian officials should not do is carry out a war of words with Donald Trump,&quot; Daniel Hamilton, a foreign policy expert at the Brookings Institution, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It is pointless. (Trump&apos;s) tactic is disorientation and distraction. Don&apos;t be distracted by his words or insults. Focus on your own interests and the role the United States may still be able to play to advance those interests. Stick to the specifics of the issues.&quot; Michael O&apos;Hanlon, a foreign policy expert at the Brookings Institution, also said that Zelensky should &quot;avoid getting into verbal spats with the American president and vice president because to some extent it&apos;s what they thrive on&quot; but should not &quot;hesitate to express differences of opinion clearly and calmly.&quot; Several top U.S. officials, including U.S. State Secretary Marco Rubio, urged Zelensky to apologize to Trump after their clash during a meeting in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. Zelensky was berated by Trump and Vice President JD Vance and was told to leave the White House soon after. Analysts say that Zelensky should try to mend relations with Trump, but an outright apology or unilateral concessions would be seen as weakness. &quot;If (Zelensky) apologizes in a humiliating way, it will only lead to negative consequences,&quot; Fesenko said. &quot;Then, we will simply be crushed, oppressed, and forced to comply with whatever they dictate. We will lose the remnants of our independence.&quot; (Collage) US President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky meet in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, U.S. on Feb. 28, 2025. (Saul Loeb / AFP / Getty Images)He argued that the &quot;right tone must be found, and we must act extremely carefully &#x2014; as if walking through a minefield.&quot; Volodymyr Dubovyk, head of Odesa National University&apos;s Center for International Studies, also said that an outright apology from Zelensky &quot;would mean that Ukraine&apos;s position is weakening and softening.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s exactly what they want,&quot; he added. Fesenko and Dubovyk said that Zelensky should not seek a new personal meeting with Trump because it is unlikely to be productive. &quot;I think the very optics of (such meetings) is already negative, and so there&apos;s no need for them to meet physically again,&quot; Dubovyk said. Instead of a direct meeting between Zelensky and Trump, future contacts with the U.S. should be handled by professional negotiators, experts say. &quot;I think we already have enough experience to know that personal meetings with Trump don&apos;t work out,&quot; Mykhailo Minakov, head of the Ukrainian Research Program at the Kennan Institute, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Right now, we need to take a bit of a pause on direct personal contacts (between Zelensky and Trump) and focus on rebuilding at least some level of trust between the teams and restoring communication between the two camps.&quot; One of the stumbling blocks in U.S.-Ukrainian relations has been the issue of security guarantees. Zelensky has urged the U.S. to provide security guarantees to Ukraine before any ceasefire deal could be reached. The U.S. has been reluctant to provide them and insisted that a ceasefire deal should precede any discussion on security guarantees. O&apos;Hanlon said that Zelensky should &quot;recognize that Ukraine will likely get some outside security backstop, and continue to express hope that the United States will be part of any such arrangement, but recognize too that Kyiv is not in a position to &apos;demand&apos; it.&quot; Fesenko argued that, if Zelensky keeps insisting on security guarantees as a precondition for a ceasefire, relations with the U.S. are unlikely to improve. He said that &quot;this specific demand triggered a highly negative reaction from both Trump and Vance.&quot; &quot;They have no intention of providing us with any direct or official security guarantees,&quot; he added. &quot;Therefore, in my opinion, there is no sense in banging our heads against a locked door, only to end up with more bruises and an even deeper conflict with the U.S.&quot; On March 4, Zelensky attempted to mend relations with the U.S. Without apologizing directly, he wrote a conciliatory post on X (Twitter) expressing his gratitude to Trump and &quot;reiterating Ukraine&apos;s commitment to peace.&quot; He also proposed &quot;the release of prisoners and truce in the sky &#x2014; ban on missiles, long-range drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure &#x2014; and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same.&quot; Zelensky also said that Ukraine was ready to sign a mineral resources deal with the U.S. at any time and that he saw it as &quot;a step toward greater security and solid security guarantees.&quot; The deal would open the way for the U.S. to gain a cut of Ukrainian natural resources through a joint investment fund as payback for the country&apos;s support for Kyiv. The agreement was to be signed in Washington on Feb. 28 but the clash between Zelensky and Trump derailed the process. Two days after Zelensky proposed a bilateral ban on the use of missiles, Russia launched a massive missile attack against Ukraine, targeting the country&apos;s energy system and killing civilians. Wohlforth argued that Zelensky&apos;s statement is &quot;an effort to move beyond (the White House clash with Trump) and position Ukraine as ready to make moves toward a ceasefire agreement even if the security guarantee issue is not yet resolved.&quot; &quot;Zelensky did say the (White House) incident was &apos;regrettable,&apos; so essentially saying &apos;let&apos;s move on,&apos;&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;His proposal for limiting some elements of the conflict is an attempt to show he is not blocking explorations for peace.&quot; Peter Rough, a senior fellow at Hudson Institute, told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;Zelensky&apos;s post was a smart move&quot; that &quot;lowered the temperature ahead of Trump&apos;s address to Congress and removed some of the poison from the relationship.&quot; During his speech in Congress on March 4, Trump indicated that he had read Zelensky&apos;s post and said that he &quot;appreciated&quot; it. O&apos;Hanlon argued that it sounded &quot;like President Trump is ready to move on and that he liked what he heard from President Zelensky.&quot; Hamilton also said that Trump &quot;did respond positively to Zelensky&apos;s statement.&quot; However, analysts argue that Trump&apos;s rhetoric itself does not mean anything, and everything depends on what action he will take. The U.S. halted military aid to Ukraine and intelligence sharing with Kyiv on March 4 and has not resumed either aid or intelligence cooperation since then. Meanwhile, the U.S.-Ukrainian negotiations on the mineral resource deal intensified in recent days, but so far, it has not been signed.

(Andrew Harnik / Getty Images)Fesenko said he believes Ukraine should set the resumption of military aid as a condition for signing the mineral resource deal. Hamilton said that there are &quot;mixed signals&quot; and &quot;with some decisions being overtaken by events, so it&apos;s unclear even within (Trump&apos;s) administration where things are really going.&quot; Bettina Renz, a professor of international security at Nottingham University, said that &quot;considering Trump&apos;s inconsistency and often contradictory approach, I would not read too much into what he said about Ukraine in his Congress speech.&quot; &quot;At this point, it remains uncertain whether President Trump will take a more cooperative approach towards achieving peace in Ukraine that does not almost exclusively favor Russian interests and would come at devastating expense to Ukraine,&quot; she told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;If such a cooperative approach, which will include Ukraine&apos;s full involvement in any negotiations, is not forthcoming, the relationship between the United States and Ukraine &#x2014; and also Europe &#x2014; will not improve anytime soon.&quot; If Trump&apos;s administration remains unwilling to maintain at least some level of support for Ukraine, as things stand, Zelensky will be left with little option but to place his hope in Europe&apos;s faltering efforts to keep Kyiv afloat.	https://kyivindependent.com/what-options-does-zelensky-have-as-relations-with-us-hit-record-low/	2025-03-07T08:55:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202563551.jpg
Von der Leyen seeks to give Ukraine access to EU single market as part of peace deal, Telegraph reports	European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wants to grant Ukraine privileged access to the EU single market as part of a final peace deal, The Telegraph reported on March 7, citing an unnamed senior EU official. Asked whether von der Leyen is ready to stretch EU rules to their limit for Ukraine, the unnamed senior EU official told the Telegraph that &quot;it&#x2019;s already going in that direction.&quot; Such a move could bring a boost to Ukraine&apos;s war-torn economy with the country&apos;s defense industry as a key element of the EU plan, the Telegraph reported. Tariff-free access to Ukrainian weapons will bring Kyiv funds while increasing the arsenals of EU countries, according to the newspaper. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that Ukraine currently produces about a third of the needed weapons, aiming to produce 50%. According to the EU plan, Brussels will choose which sectors to open to Ukraine and which to keep closed, the newspaper reported. Ukraine applied for EU membership at the onset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. The country has made quick progress, achieving candidate status within months, with the initial negotiations formally launching in June 2024. Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said in 2023 that Kyiv was seeking to ensure full integration into the EU&apos;s single market before joining the bloc. Kyiv will open two or three negotiation clusters in the first six months of 2025 under Poland&apos;s rotating presidency, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in January.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-proposes-to-give-ukraine-access-to-single-market-as-part-of-peace-deal-telegraph-reports/	2025-03-07T08:13:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1246951382.jpg
Russia proposes to build drone factory in Belarus to 'ensure security'	Russia has proposed building a drone factory in neighbouring Belarus, Belarusian state media reported on Mar. 6. Kremlin Deputy Chief of Staff Maxim Oreshkin made the announcement during a trip to Minsk where he met Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko at a drone exhibition. &quot;It&#x2019;s very important that Belarus has its own [drone] production facilities, which would strengthen both its economy and national security,&quot; Oreshkin said. &quot;We are ready to build the plant,&quot; Lukashenko said in response. The plant is expected to produce up to 100,000 units per year but no details were given about the type of drone or if they would be for military use. Oreshkin said that drone production will strengthen the Belarusian economy, including agriculture, logistics, and power generation, and increase GDP. &quot;It is vital for Belarus to have production facilities that will make not only the economy, but also the security sphere of the country truly sovereign,&quot; he added. While at the exhibition, the pair were given a demonstration of &#xA0;an &#x2018;artistic&#x2019; drone which painted a mural. Belarusian state media described it as &quot;the largest art object (ever) created by a drone.&quot; Currently Russia uses around 100 to 200 kamikaze drones per attack against Ukraine which occur on a daily basis, but Russian forces plan to increase their capabilities to 500, Vadym Skibitskyi, the deputy head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), said on March 3. &#xA0; Russia also plans to increase the number of sites from which drones will be launched, he added. Belarus is one of Russia&apos;s staunchest allies and part of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was launched from its territory. Belarus is currently under U.S. and European sanctions for supporting Russia&apos;s invasion and the detention of political prisoners.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-proposes-to-build-drone-factory-in-belarus-to-ensure-security/	2025-03-07T07:32:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2187908233--1-.jpg
Trump says he considers sanctioning Russia because it's 'pounding' Ukrainian troops	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 7 that he is considering imposing sweeping banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia until there is a ceasefire and peace agreement. According to Trump, his statement is based on the fact that Russia &quot;is absolutely &#x2018;pounding&#x2019; Ukraine on the battlefield&quot; - a possible reference to Russia&apos;s recent advances in Kursk Oblast. &quot;Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely &apos;pounding&apos; Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large-scale banking sanctions, sanctions, and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and final settlement agreement on peace is reached,&quot; Trump wrote on the Truth Social media platform. &quot;To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late.

UK volunteer after surviving Russian strike on Kryvyi Rih — 'Trump, Vance, come see Ukraine for yourselves’	A team of foreign volunteers had just finished dinner at a cozy hotel restaurant in Kryvyi Rih &#x2014; a city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast where they had recently arrived to bring locals humanitarian aid &#x2014; when a notification on their phones suddenly made the atmosphere tense. A Russian ballistic missile was heading toward the city. &quot;We decided to go to the shelter, but we did not have enough time,&quot; British volunteer Karol Swiacki told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We stood up and made a few steps, but then there was a big hit, loud noise, and a huge explosion. And then dust all over. There was so much dust that we couldn&apos;t breathe or see anything.&quot; The powerful blast from the strike, which occurred around 10 p.m. on March 5, heavily damaged the five-story hotel. As a result of the attack, five people were killed and 32 were injured, including two children aged 13 and 17, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. Apart from the hotel, the missile strike also damaged 14 apartment buildings, a post office, almost two dozen cars, a cultural center, and 12 shops, the governor said. &quot;We saw the damage that (the missile) had done, not only to the hotel, it was all on fire,&quot; Swiacki recalls. &quot;People were screaming. There were people with blood on their faces, dead people.&quot; &quot;People died in front of our eyes. It was a nightmare. We were in hell.&quot; Sitting roughly 70 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of the nearest front line, Kryvyi Rih remains a frequent target of Russian missile attacks. With a population of about 660,000, it is the second-largest city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and the hometown of President Volodymyr Zelensky. &quot;Just before the strike, volunteers from a humanitarian organization checked into the hotel &#x2014; citizens of Ukraine, the U.S., and the U.K.,&quot; Zelensky said after the attack. &quot;They survived because they managed to escape their rooms.&quot; Swiacki, who heads the U.K.-based NGO Ukraine Relief, says that all of the eight people he was with were fortunate enough to escape injury in the deadly attack. &quot;(After the explosion) we tried to get out of the hotel and went through the broken windows. It was so dangerous, we didn&apos;t know if it would collapse,&quot; Swiacki recalls.

(Karol Swiacki / Ukraine Relief NGO)&quot;But when we saw it from outside, oh my God&#x2026; We realized the reason for that big explosion: a missile.&quot; Swiacki says that if they had been in their rooms when the missile struck the hotel, they likely would have been killed. &quot;Everything was smashed. It was just an absolute disaster,&quot; he says. Originally from Poland, Swiacki dropped his career in entertainment shortly after the full-scale invasion started, launching the non-profit: &quot;I remember my grandma&apos;s stories of what Russians were doing to our people in Poland, so I understand what it means.&quot; &quot;I am fully aware of what this war is about. This has nothing to do with peace. They want to destroy Ukraine, take it over, and break the nation completely. This is an absolute disgrace,&quot; Swiacki says. Since Feb. 24, 2022, Swiacki and his team have delivered over five tons of humanitarian aid across Ukraine, as well as power generators, wheelchairs for people with disabilities, medical beds, and other essential supplies. Karol Swiacki (L) and Igor Logvinov (R) in Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine, on March 6, 2025. (Karol Swiacki / Ukraine Relief NGO)During their latest trip to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, they brought sports equipment and other items to support Ukrainian children affected by the war. Swiacki says the attack on Kryvyi Rih destroyed three of their cars parked outside the hotel. His team was able to recover the equipment from the &quot;smashed van&quot; and plan to deliver it to the children soon. &quot;We&apos;re continuing to support Ukraine. Many people would say we should stop, but no, it works the other way around. We will never stop and are stronger than ever,&quot; he says. The attack on Kryvyi Rih took place amid the Trump administration&apos;s decision to freeze military aid and limit intelligence sharing to Ukraine &#x2014; affecting warnings about Russian drones and missiles targeting Ukrainian military and civilian sites. Swiacki says he wishes U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance would come and see the war for themselves. &quot;Please come to Ukraine and see it yourself,&quot; he says. &quot;People are dying here.&quot; Overnight on March 7, just two days after the Kryvyi Rih attack, Russia launched at least 67 missiles of various types and 194 attack and decoy drones against Ukraine, targeting energy and gas infrastructure across the country. &quot;We need air defense all over Ukraine to stop these killings. No one can defend against these rockets without air defense,&quot; Swiacki says. &quot;I hope the West will finally wake up,&quot; he adds. Hi! Daria Shulzhenko here. I wrote this piece for you. Since the first day of Russia&apos;s all-out war, &#xA0;I have been working almost non-stop to tell the stories of those affected by Russia&#x2019;s brutal aggression. By telling all those painful stories, we are helping to keep the world informed about the reality of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine.

US Chamber of Commerce in Russia readies proposals on sanctions relief	The American Chamber of Commerce in Russia (AmCham Russia) is preparing a report for the U.S. government recommending easing certain sanctions against Russia, pro-Kremlin outlet RBC reported on March 7, citing chamber chief Robert Agee. The proposed recommendations focus on lifting restrictions on the aviation and banking industries, investments, and luxury goods shipments. Agee argued that such measures would help American businesses regain &quot;lost market share&quot; and &quot;reduce operational costs in Russia.&quot; AmCham is a business association that represents U.S. companies operating in Russia. It promotes economic engagement despite strained relations between the two countries. This development follows U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s statement on Feb. 25 that sanctions on Russia will be lifted &quot;at some point&quot; but not before a peace deal is reached. His administration has renewed diplomatic contact with Moscow, engaging in direct talks on the war in Ukraine, the reopening of embassies, and economic cooperation. The primary focus of the chamber&apos;s request concerns the aviation sector, particularly the supply of spare parts and aircraft maintenance. Additionally, AmCham Russia seeks to lift the U.S. investment ban imposed in 2022, which currently allows only maintenance operations but prohibits new investments. Another key area of concern is the banking sector, with Agee saying that lifting financial restrictions would facilitate cross-border payments and &quot;ease the cost of doing business.&quot; The chamber also advocates removing restrictions on luxury goods, including cosmetics, perfumes, clothing, and footwear priced above $300 per unit. Despite these discussions, Trump extended some existing sanctions on Russia until March 6, 2026, according to a decree published in the Federal Register on Feb. 28. Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed his Cabinet of Ministers on Feb. 21 to prepare for the return of Western companies, saying Russian firms should have &quot;certain advantages&quot; over those re-entering the market. Sanctions against Russia remain a key tool of international pressure, Ukraine&apos;s Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna said on Feb. 19. Stefanishyna expressed uncertainty regarding the U.S. position and its next steps but appeared confident in the EU&apos;s commitment to upholding sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/amcham-russia-to-urge-us-to-ease-sanctions-on-aviation-banking-investments/	2025-03-07T05:49:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1259010576.jpg
Ukraine wasn't officially asked by US to make territorial concessions, Foreign Ministry says	Ukraine has not received any official proposals for territorial concessions as part of potential peace talks with Russia from the U.S. or other partners, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry&apos;s spokesperson said on March 7. &quot;We have not received such proposals,&quot; spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said during a press briefing, downplaying the significance of &quot;certain formulations that could be heard in the media.&quot; The Trump administration has said that both Kyiv and Moscow will have to make concessions for a successful peace deal and called Ukraine&apos;s prospects to return to pre-2014 borders &quot;unrealistic.&quot; Russian forces continue to occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory. The Ukrainian population under Russian occupation has been subjected to systematic repression, torture, and abuse. &quot;We don&apos;t focus on emotions or verbal clashes right now. Diplomacy does its work, mostly quietly, outside the cameras&apos; reach,&quot; Tykhyi said. The comments come ahead of a meeting between U.S. and Ukrainian delegations in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11, which will concern the framework for a potential peace agreement. This would mark the first high-level meeting between the two sides since the heated exchange between President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance in the White House on Feb. 28. The clash soured the relationship between the two countries, leading to Washington freezing military and intelligence support for Ukraine. According to Tykhyi, the meeting in Saudi Arabia will concern bilateral ties, strategic partnership, and a path toward peace. He reiterated that Ukraine is ready to sign a natural resources agreement with the U.S. but did not confirm whether the deal will be signed next week. The deal&apos;s signing has been on hold since the televised quarrel between Zelensky and Trump last week. Bloomberg reported that the U.S. is newly linking the deal&apos;s signing to Ukraine committing itself to a quick truce.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-partners-made-no-official-proposals-on-ukraines-territorial-concessions-foreign-ministry-says/	2025-03-07T05:43:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2166117545.jpg
Zelensky to visit South Africa on April 10 for talks with President Ramaphosa	President Volodymyr Zelensky will visit South Africa on April 10 to meet with the country&apos;s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and discuss efforts to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, Bloomberg reported on March 7. &quot;The visit is a continuation of ongoing engagements held by President Ramaphosa with President Putin and President Zelensky on an inclusive peace process that will provide a path to peace between Russia and Ukraine,&quot; said Ramaphosa&apos;s spokesperson, Vincent Magwenya. South Africa, the continent&apos;s largest economy, has maintained a neutral stance in the war while deepening its economic and political ties with Moscow. The country is a member of the BRICS group alongside Russia and China and conducted joint naval drills with both nations while resisting Western calls to distance itself from the Kremlin. Ramaphosa previously led a peace initiative in 2023 alongside leaders from five other African nations, but the effort failed to yield concrete results. During a visit to Kyiv on June 16, 2023, he presented a 10-point peace plan as part of the African Peace Mission. Zelensky&apos;s rare upcoming visit is part of a diplomatic outreach to Africa as Kyiv seeks broader global support before upcoming peace negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-visit-south-africa-on-april-10-for-talks-with-president-ramaphosa-bloomberg-reports/	2025-03-07T05:11:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/rama.jpg
The case against European rearmament	Inducting Ukraine into NATO after forcing Russia back behind its pre-2014 borders has been the only strategic aim EU leaders have allowed themselves to contemplate since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion three years ago. Alas, well before U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s re-election, this aim slipped into the realm of infeasibility. The writing had been on the wall for a while. First, Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s war economy proved a godsend to his regime. Second, even Trump&#x2019;s predecessor, Joe Biden, was terminally unwilling to push for Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership, leading the country down the garden path with vague promises. And, third, there was strong bipartisan opposition in the United States to the idea of NATO troops fighting alongside Ukrainians. So, in a display of breathtaking hypocrisy, the many &#x201C;Putin is the new Hitler&#x201D; speeches never resulted in a commitment to fight alongside the Ukrainians until Putin&#x2019;s army was defeated on the ground. Instead, a cowardly West kept sending weapons to the exhausted Ukrainians so that they could defeat the &#x201C;new Hitler&#x201D; on its behalf &#x2014; but on their own. Inevitably, and despite gallant fighting by increasingly outgunned and outnumbered Ukrainian soldiers, European leaders&#x2019; sole strategic aim turned to dust &#x2014; a reality that would have become undeniable regardless of who won the U.S. presidency last November. Trump merely brought it forward with a brutality reflecting his long-held contempt not just for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky but also for the European Union itself. And so, lacking any Plan B, a Europe weakened by a two-decades-long economic slump is now struggling to respond to Trump&#x2019;s Ukraine policy. After the Munich Agreement in 1938, Winston Churchill famously proclaimed that Neville Chamberlain had been &#x201C;given the choice between war and dishonor. You chose dishonor, and you will have war.&#x201D; In their angst not to make the same mistake, EU leaders are about to repeat it, in reverse: their war-until-victory approach will give way to the humiliating peace that Trump will gleefully impose on them, and on Zelensky&#x2019;s government, when they eventually come begging. While it is undoubtedly true that Europe must either rise to the occasion or disintegrate, the question is: Rise how? What&#x2019;s really wrong with Europe? What is the EU missing the most? It beggars belief that Europeans cannot recognize the answer staring us in the face: Europe is missing a proper Treasury, the equivalent of the State Department, and a Parliament with the power to dismiss what passes as its government (the European Council). Even worse, there is still no discussion of how to plug these gaping holes in Europe&#x2019;s institutional architecture. The EU has always dreaded the beginning of any Ukraine peace process precisely because it would expose the bloc&#x2019;s nakedness. Who would represent Europe at the negotiating table, even if Trump invited us to join? Even if the European Commission and Council could wave a magic wand to conjure a large, well-armed EU army into existence, who would have the democratic authority to send it into battle to kill and be killed? Moreover, who can raise enough taxes to ensure the EU army&#x2019;s permanent combat-readiness? The EU&#x2019;s intergovernmental decision-making means that no one has the democratic legitimacy to make such decisions. European leaders pose for a group photo during a summit at Lancaster House in London, U.K., on March 2, 2025. (Justin Tallis/Pool/AFP via Getty Images)When Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, recently announced her new ReArm Europe initiative, sad memories of the incompetent Juncker Plan, Green Deal, and Recovery Plan came flooding back. Large headline figures were again being tossed about, only to be exposed on closer scrutiny as smoke and mirrors. Does anyone seriously expect France to increase its already-unsustainable public-finance deficit to fund weaponry? Absent the institutions to enact military Keynesianism, the only way Europe can rearm is by shifting funds from its crumbling social and physical infrastructure &#x2014; further weakening a Europe already reaping the bitter harvest of popular discontent, which is fueling the rise of far-right forces across the continent. And for what? Does anyone believe that Putin will be deterred by a Europe that may have a few more shells and howitzers but is drifting further away from the prospect of the federal governance needed to decide matters of war and peace? ReArm Europe will do nothing to win the war for Ukraine. It will, however, almost certainly drive the EU deeper into its pre-existing economic slump &#x2014; the underlying cause of Europe&#x2019;s weakness. To keep Europeans safe in the face of the twin challenges posed by Trump and Putin, the EU must embark on its own multi-pronged Peace Now process. First, the EU must reject outright Trump&#x2019;s predatory effort to grab Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources. Then, after floating the prospect of relaxing sanctions and returning $300 billion in frozen assets (which cannot simultaneously be used as a bargaining chip and for Ukraine&#x2019;s reconstruction), the EU should commence negotiations with the Kremlin, offering the prospect of a comprehensive strategic arrangement within which Ukraine becomes what Austria was during the Cold War: sovereign, armed, neutral, and as integrated with Western Europe as its citizens desire. Third, instead of a permanent stand-off between two large armies along the agreed border, the EU should propose a demilitarized zone at least 500 kilometers (310 miles) deep on each side, the right of return of all displaced people, a Good Friday-style agreement for the governance of disputed areas, and a Green New Deal for the war-torn areas, jointly financed by the EU and Russia. All outstanding issues should be addressed in negotiations held under the auspices of the United Nations. Lastly, the EU should use the prospect of relaxing tariffs on Chinese goods (green tech, in particular) and sanctions on technology exports to open negotiations with China with a view to a new security arrangement that reduces tensions and enlists the Chinese to the goal of safeguarding Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty. If we truly want to strengthen Europe, the first step is not to rearm. It is to forge the democratic union without which stagnation will continue to erode Europe&#x2019;s capacities, rendering it unable to rebuild what is left of Ukraine once Putin is finished with it.

Russia reportedly breaks through in Kursk Oblast; military hasn't confirmed	Russian forces have made a breakthrough south of the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha, potentially threatening to cut off some of the Ukrainian positions in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Agentstvo and Ukrainska Pravda reported on March 7. An undisclosed military source deployed in Kursk Oblast told the Ukrainska Pravda outlet that Russian forces have broken through Ukrainian defenses south of Sudzha and that the defenders are trying to stabilize the situation. Ukrainian forces are trying to contain the Russian advance to prevent a partial or complete encirclement, the source claimed. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The spokesperson of the Ukrainian group of forces in Kursk Oblast declined to comment. Russian forces have recently intensified efforts to break through to Sumy Oblast to cut off the Ukrainian salient in bordering Kursk Oblast. Kyiv has sought to maintain its position in the Russian border region as leverage for possible peace talks. Russian forces have almost reached the Ukrainian border south of Ukrainian positions in Sudzha, meaning that at least some areas have been cut off from the main salient, the independent Russian outlet Agentstvo reported, citing an expert from the Conflict Intelligence Team. &quot;Difficult battles continue in the border area of Sumy Oblast; Russian assault units are attempting to break through and move toward a highway from Yunakivka (in Sumy Oblast) to Sudzha in Kursk Oblast,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. &quot;The Defense Forces are fighting and dealing significant casualties to Russian troops,&quot; Kovalenko claimed, without confirming a Russian breakthrough. The estimated Russian advance in Kursk Oblast as of March 7, 2025, according to DeepState. Ukrainian positions in Kursk Oblast marked in blue. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Ukrainska Pravda&apos;s source claimed that the breakthrough occurred between March 5 and 6 and was the result of a gradual and systematic Russian campaign in the area. The Ukrainian battlefield monitoring group DeepState seems to confirm a Russian advance, indicating a push deep into Ukrainian positions toward the Ukrainian state border in Sumy Oblast. DeepState marked the village of Kurilovka, lying some 5 kilometers (3 miles) south of Sudzha, as a contested area as of March 6. The monitoring service reported further advances the following day. The prominent Russian pro-war channel Tw Majors also reported on the advance, claiming that Moscow&apos;s troops have penetrated up to 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) deep into Ukrainian positions. Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024. After six months of fighting in the region, Russian troops have regained control of about 64% of the territory in the region, the Russian military claimed. Russian casualties have reached nearly 40,000 in Kursk Oblast, including over 16,000 killed, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Feb. 6. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said last November that the incursion thwarted Russia&apos;s plans to invade Sumy Oblast in an attempt to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-reportedly-attempting-a-breakthrough-south-of-sudzha-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-03-07T04:30:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2182865870.jpg
Trump's cryptic Russia comment 'probably just bluster,' experts say	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s claim to be the only person who knows why Russia wants to &quot;make a deal&quot; and end the war in Ukraine is &quot;probably just bluster,&quot; experts have told the Kyiv Independent. Speaking to reporters in the White House on March 6, Trump addressed his ongoing &#x2014; and controversial &#x2014; efforts to end the fighting and bring both Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table. &quot;I think what&#x2019;s going to happen is Ukraine wants to make a deal because I don&#x2019;t think they have a choice,&quot; he said. &quot;I also think that Russia wants to make a deal because in a certain different way &#x2014; a different way that only I know, only I know &#x2014; they have no choice,&quot; Trump cryptically added. Trump did not elaborate, and his comments left observers baffled as to what he might be referring to. &quot;No clue,&quot; former U.K. Defense Attache in Moscow, John Foreman, told the Kyiv Independent when asked for his thoughts. &quot;Unless he&#x2019;s referring to intel about discussions in Moscow about how long they can keep at it, the real state of the Russian army or economy, or (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&#x2019;s health,&quot; he added. Jenny Mathers, a Russian political expert and lecturer at the U.K.&apos;s Aberystwyth University, dismissed the comments as &quot;probably just bluster to make Trump look like he is getting something out of his conversations with Putin.&quot; &quot;Trump is always claiming unique abilities, so it is not too surprising that he is claiming some unique knowledge. I seriously doubt that Putin is confiding secret Russian weaknesses or strategy to Trump,&quot; she added. But like Foreman, Mathers did also keep open the possibility that Trump was referring to possible U.S. intelligence reports that &quot;reveal Russian weaknesses.&quot; &quot;But that does not fit well with Trump&#x2019;s eagerness to offer up front concessions to Moscow before peace talks even begin,&quot; she added. The Kremlin is reportedly growing increasingly concerned by the state of Russia&apos;s economy amid Western sanctions and soaring inflation caused by record wartime spending. Moscow has reactivated a special economic commission initially created during the Covid-19 pandemic to monitor struggling industries and implement relief measures, The Moscow Times reported on Feb. 11, citing Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak. Meanwhile on the battlefield, Russian advances have slowed in recent weeks, with Ukraine even making small gains in some areas. The 25th Separate Airborne Brigade reported on Feb. 26 that Ukrainian troops had regained control of the village of Kotlyne, near Pokrovsk. Kotlyne and Pokrovsk are connected by the T 0406 highway, which also leads to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. As for Putin&apos;s health &#x2014; rumors of ill-health have periodically surfaced at various points during Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, but nothing definitive has yet been confirmed.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-cryptic-russia-comment-probably-just-bluster-experts-say/	2025-03-07T04:11:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203672195.jpg
Germany should reduce reliance on US arms amid geopolitical shifts, Airbus Defense and Space CEO says	Germany should reduce its dependence on U.S. defense manufacturers amid shifting political signals from Washington, the CEO of Airbus Defense and Space, Michael Schollhorn, warned in an interview with Augsburger Allgemeine, published on March 7. Schollhorn emphasized that Berlin should prioritize European defense companies, particularly as Germany&apos;s likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has announced plans to raise hundreds of billions of euros for defense and infrastructure. &quot;If we continue to buy off-the-shelf products from the United States with this higher defense spending, we are cementing our dependence on others,&quot; Schollhorn said. The business executive added that Denmark may already realize that purchasing U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets was a questionable decision, mainly &quot;if they actually had to defend Greenland.&quot; Schollhorn&apos;s remarks follow U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s controversial statement on March 4, in which he once again expressed interest in acquiring Greenland through purchase or force. Schollhorn argued that Europe&apos;s defense industries must collaborate more closely instead of competing individually. &quot;We need not only an increase in defense spending at the national level but also a coordinated approach among key European countries,&quot; he said. The comments come amid growing scrutiny of Trump&apos;s foreign policy, as the U.S. president has echoed Kremlin narratives, sidelined Kyiv and Europe in direct talks with Moscow, and accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of prolonging Russia&apos;s war. On March 6, Trump also cast doubt on Washington&apos;s commitment to defending its NATO partners, saying that the U.S. will not protect those that fail to meet defense spending targets. During a meeting with Zelensky on Feb. 28, Trump said that Europe should take responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security and refused to offer U.S. guarantees. Washington has since frozen all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, a move widely seen as an attempt to pressure Kyiv into negotiations with Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-should-lessen-reliance-on-us-weapons-amid-shifting-politics-airbus-defense-chief-says/	2025-03-07T04:09:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1257482771.jpg
Trump’s aid cuts could trap Eastern Europe in a disinformation bubble	Georgia is in a grim state. Once vibrant, welcoming, and hopeful, it has become a country where peaceful protesters are beaten and journalists are branded as traitors. Over the past year, the ruling Georgian Dream party has stifled civil society and media with its foreign agent law, extended its reign for another four years through a rigged election, and announced it would &#x201C;suspend&#x201D; efforts to join the EU. In the Georgia of 2025, war is called peace, and slavery is called freedom. Disinformation is the Georgian government&#x2019;s weapon of choice, including pushing Russian narratives about the brutal, full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Like its anti-democratic counterparts in Hungary, Belarus, and Azerbaijan, the Georgian government has identified the media as the primary obstacle to consolidating authoritarian rule. A long campaign of discreditation, financial strangulation, and intimidation of donors has taken its toll. The voices of independent journalists are fading, and with new legislation poised to de facto outlaw independent outlets, the final blow may be near &#x2014; a kiss of death carried on Russia&#x2019;s breath. The sudden termination of U.S. aid funding came as a shock to an already struggling independent media landscape. I co-founded OC Media in 2017 to inform both local and international readers about the Caucasus &#x2014; from Grozny to Tbilisi, Yerevan to Baku. Providing a progressive voice, where facts matter and showing an alternative to state media narratives, has always been our guiding principle. But it&#x2019;s clear these principles are not shared by the Trump administration, whose cuts cost us $250,000 in expected funding for 2025 &#x2014; 80% of our core operational budget. Nearly every online media outlet in Georgia was affected, and I expect many, or even most of them, to close in the coming weeks and months. This is a pattern repeating across Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia; reports suggest these cuts could devastate Ukraine&#x2019;s media landscape as well. If nothing changes, we risk surrendering the media space to those who can afford it: the oligarchs, authoritarian governments, and, perhaps most concerning of all, Russia. This could leave our region in a disinformation bubble, where Russian-backed narratives, including those that seek to blame Ukraine for being invaded, proliferate. Without independent outlets like OC Media, the overwhelming support Georgian society has for Ukraine may be buried under the weight of pro-government media. Part of this vulnerability in the media is certainly our own fault. For years in Georgia, we in the media have relied too heavily on donor aid, neglecting other potential sources of revenue. But it doesn&#x2019;t have to be this way. People attend an opposition rally against election results outside the parliament in Tbilisi, Georgia, on Oct. 28, 2024. (Mirian Meladze / Anadolu via Getty Images)Last summer, I visited Kyiv for the first time since Russia&#x2019;s brutal full-scale invasion began, to learn from our colleagues at the Kyiv Independent, who have survived revolutions, wars, and the most insidious propaganda &#x2014; the kind that turns victims into aggressors. The Kyiv Independent has pioneered a model many thought impossible in our region: creating a media outlet fully funded by its readers, independent of U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s tantrums or the whims of institutional donors. Their approach has shown that self-sufficiency is not just an ideal &#x2014; it is essential for our survival. We launched our own membership program almost a year ago, as the Georgian government pushed ahead with its Russian-style foreign agent law. But it was only on the brink of collapse that our membership truly gained traction. Today, I am proud to say that 10% of our core budget now comes from reader support &#x2014; something few believed possible in the Caucasus. This is just the beginning. If readers choose to support the media they rely on, then perhaps we can fight back against a world where the president of the most powerful country in the world calls the leader of a defending nation a dictator. I know Georgians deserve better. My government has chosen the path of disinformation and repression, but independent media remains a lifeline &#x2014; for Georgians, for Ukrainians, and for all those who can still tell the victim from the aggressor. During my trip to Kyiv last summer, beyond the usual shock of air raid sirens and the echoes of explosions, what struck me most was the resilience of a people under siege &#x2014; and the crucial role Ukrainian media have had in defying disinformation, both at home and abroad. Now, across Eastern Europe, independent media is in deep crisis. Yet despite our borders, our histories, and our governments, our struggle is the same. The Kyiv Independent is leading the way with its reader-funded model, and OC Media is proud to follow. We have been overwhelmed by the support we have already received in donations and membership sign-ups to help us survive. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m asking you to join the Kyiv Independent, OC Media, and other media outlets across the region in this fight &#x2014; before we lose our ability to resist the authoritarian disinformation tide, as so many already have.

Ukraine receives $970 million from UK under G7 loan covered by Russian assets	Ukraine has received 752 million pounds ($970 million) as the first installment of the U.K.&apos;s contribution to the G7 loan covered by frozen Russian assets, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on March 7. The U.K. has pledged to lend Ukraine 2.26 billion pounds ($2.9 billion) in three equal installments as part of the G7&apos;s Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration scheme, worth $50 billion in total. &quot;The funds will go towards strengthening Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities,&quot; Shmyhal said on X. &quot;I am grateful to (British Prime Minister) Keir Starmer, the U.K. government and our G7 partners for the mechanism to make Russian money work for Ukraine.&quot; At the onset of the full-scale war in 2022, the G7 countries immobilized some $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets. The $50 billion loan, shouldered mainly by the U.S. and the EU, will be funneled to Ukraine&apos;s defense needs and recovery and repaid by proceeds from the frozen assets. &quot;We expect all sovereign assets of the Russian Federation to be confiscated and transferred to benefit our country in the future,&quot; Shmyhal noted.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-receives-970-million-from-uk-under-g7-loan-covered-by-russian-assets/	2025-03-07T03:52:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1258928921.jpeg
Zelensky to meet Saudi Crown prince on March 10	President Volodymyr Zelensky said he would travel to Saudi Arabia on March 10 and meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman before talks with U.S. partners. Zelensky initially intended to visit Saudi Arabia as part of a Middle East tour in February but delayed the trip due to bilateral U.S.-Russian talks in Riyadh on Feb. 18. The Gulf countries have traditionally played the role of a mediator between Russia and Ukraine, namely in regard to prisoner exchanges. Following Zelensky&apos;s meeting with the Saudi crown prince, the Ukrainian president&apos;s team will remain in the country on March 11 to meet U.S. delegates and discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement. This would mark the first high-level meeting between the two sides since the heated exchange between Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance in the White House on Feb. 28. The televised clash derailed plans for the signing of a natural resources agreement and preceded the U.S. freezing all military and intelligence support for Kyiv amid ongoing hostilities with Russia. &quot;Ukraine is most interested in peace. As we told (President Donald Trump), Ukraine is working and will continue to work constructively for a swift and reliable peace,&quot; Zelensky said on X. Top U.S. officials signaled that Zelensky&apos;s recent statements on a peaceful resolution of the war have been received positively in the White House and might lead to the resumption of military aid. Ukraine has repeatedly voiced readiness for peace but stressed that any ceasefire would be short-lived without clear security guarantees to deter Russian aggression. The Trump administration has refused such commitments and instead called upon Europe to take responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-meet-saudi-crown-prince-on-march-10/	2025-03-07T03:32:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/zelensky_saudi.jpeg
Zelensky's approval rating jumps to 68% after Trump clash, poll shows	President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s approval rating has risen to 68% following his heated exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump, according to a poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology published on March 7. The most significant jump came after the Feb. 28 Oval Office meeting, which ended in a public dispute over security guarantees for Ukraine and the cancellation of the U.S.-Ukraine mineral agreement signing. Before the diplomatic spat, a February 2025 survey showed that 57% of Ukrainians trusted Zelensky, while 37% did not, resulting in a trust-distrust balance of +20%. Between Feb. 14 and March 4, trust in Zelensky increased to 68%, with the share of those who do not trust him dropping to 29%, improving his net approval rating to +38%. Tech billionaire Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump, took to X on March 6 to claim that if Ukraine were to hold an election, &quot;Zelensky would lose by a landslide.&quot; Trump had earlier accused Zelensky of being a &quot;dictator without elections&quot; while blaming his administration for prolonging the war. Trump&apos;s claim ignores the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution prohibits elections during martial law, which has been in effect since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022. As a result, Zelensky&apos;s term has been extended, which constitutional lawyers argue is permitted under Ukrainian law.

Maxar Technologies reportedly restricts Ukraine's access to satellite imagery	U.S. aerospace company Maxar Technologies has restricted Ukraine&apos;s access to its satellite imagery, the Ukrainian media outlet Militarnyi reported on March 7, citing unnamed users of the service. Kyiv has relied on high-resolution satellite images for defense and strategic planning, tracking Russian troop movements, assessing battlefield conditions, and monitoring Russian infrastructure damage. The alleged move follows the U.S. decision to halt intelligence sharing with Ukraine, a shift confirmed by CIA Director John Ratcliffe on March 5. According to Militarnyi, the restriction was imposed under an order from U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration, with the State Department allegedly prohibiting U.S. companies from providing satellite data to Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent was unable to verify the claims and has contacted Maxar Technologies for confirmation but has yet to receive a response. Ukraine&apos;s cyber community Cyberboroshno also reported the restriction, claiming that free access to satellite reconnaissance had been cut off. &quot;According to our information, at least private companies can buy already ordered (satellite) images through the provider,&quot; Cyberboroshno wrote on Telegram. Washington has also frozen military aid to Kyiv as part of a broader effort to pressure President Volodymyr Zelensky into peace talks with Russia. Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on March 6 that Kyiv is working on alternatives to counter the loss of U.S. intelligence, including potential cooperation with European partners.	https://kyivindependent.com/maxar-technologies-reportedly-restricts-ukraines-access-to-satellite-imagery/	2025-03-07T02:14:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1245430860-167062044924mwa.jpg
EU members pledge $16 billion in additional support for Ukraine, Costa says	Several EU members have pledged to provide up to 15 billion euros ($16.3 billion) in additional aid for Ukraine, European Council President Antonio Costa said at a summit on March 6. EU leaders met in Brussels to discuss plans for boosting Europe&apos;s defense capabilities and support for Ukraine amid the seismic foreign policy shifts in the U.S. Ukraine&apos;s President Volodmyr Zelensky also took part in the meeting. The summit concluded without additional EU aid packages for Ukraine as the discussed 20-billion-euro tranche ($22 billion) was dropped from the final declaration. Kyiv needs more support now than ever, as the Trump administration has frozen all military assistance flowing to the country. As any EU-wide assistance package is under threat of being blocked by Hungary&apos;s Moscow-friendly leader, Viktor Orban, top EU officials suggested that further aid should be provided through a &quot;coalition of the willing.&quot; &quot;Immediately, member states can increase their support thanks to the increased fiscal space,&quot; Costa said at a press conference in Brussels. During the summit, EU leaders unanimously agreed on a new defense initiative that could mobilize up to 800 billion euros ($867 billion) through loans and loosening fiscal rules for government spending. &quot;Several member states have already announced their pledges up to 15 billion euros. Today, we have also tasked the Council to work urgently on further initiatives to address Ukraine&#x2019;s pressing military and defense needs,&quot; Costa said, without naming the countries. &quot;This is a tipping point for Europe. And today, we have shown that the European Union is rising to the challenge,&quot; the European Council president said.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-members-pledge-16-billion-in-additional-support-for-ukraine-costa-says/	2025-03-07T02:07:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/DSC07805------.jpg
French-made Mirage 2000 jets join Ukraine's defense against Russian strike for the first time	Ukraine&apos;s French-provided Mirage 2000 fighter jets took part in repelling a Russian air attack on Ukraine for the first time on March 7, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Russia launched a large-scale aerial assault overnight, firing 67 missiles of various types and deploying 194 drones. Ukraine&apos;s air defenses intercepted 34 missiles and 100 drones, with anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare systems, and mobile fire groups contributing to the effort. Fighter jets, including F-16s and French Mirage 2000s, were also deployed. French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu confirmed on Feb. 6 that the first Mirage 2000-5s pledged to Kyiv had arrived in Ukraine. The jets were part of a military aid package announced by French President Emmanuel Macron in June 2024, which included pilot training. Macron did not disclose the total number of aircraft France would supply. The Mirage 2000, a fourth-generation supersonic fighter, was first introduced by Dassault Aviation in the 1970s. The Mirage 2000-5 variant, introduced in 1999, features upgraded avionics, improved air-to-air and air-to-ground combat capabilities, and an advanced sensor and control system. The deployment of Mirage 2000 jets marks a significant step in Ukraine&apos;s air defense strategy as it continues to strengthen its capabilities against ongoing Russian attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/frances-mirage-2000-jets-first-join-ukraines-defense-against-russian-air-assault-air-forces-report/	2025-03-07T01:29:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2157350567.jpg
US 'not going to defend' NATO members missing defense spending goals, Trump says	U.S. President Donald Trump cast doubt on Washington&apos;s commitment to defending its NATO partners on March 6, saying that the U.S. will not protect those that fail to meet defense spending targets. &quot;If they don&apos;t pay, I&apos;m not going to defend them. No, I&apos;m not going to defend them,&quot; Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. The statement follows an article from NBC News that Trump is considering reducing U.S. commitments to NATO and recalibrating engagement to favor members that allocate a set percentage of their gross domestic product (GDP) to defense. &quot;They should be paying more,&quot; the U.S. president added. Trump has long demanded that NATO allies increase their military spending. He previously called for the alliance to raise its benchmark from 2% to 5% of the GDP. As of 2024, 24 of NATO&apos;s 32 members meet the current 2% target, with Poland (4.12%), Estonia (3.43%), and the U.S. (3.38%) leading the way. Several nations, including Italy, Canada, and Spain, still fall short. Some NATO members are discussing raising the spending level to 3% by 2030. Trump&apos;s remarks follow his declaration from last year that he would endorse Russia to &quot;do whatever the hell they want&quot; to NATO countries failing to meet defense criteria, a statement widely seen as undermining NATO&apos;s collective-defense principle. The comments come amid heightened scrutiny of Trump&apos;s foreign policy, as he has echoed Kremlin narratives, engaged in direct negotiations with Moscow while sidelining Kyiv, and accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of prolonging the war. Trump has also refused to offer security guarantees to Ukraine, saying during his Feb. 28 meeting with Zelensky that Europe should take responsibility for Kyiv&apos;s security. Washington has since frozen all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, a move widely seen as an attempt to pressure Kyiv into peace talks with Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-not-going-to-defend-nato-members-missing-spending-goals-trump-says/	2025-03-07T01:03:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192427196.jpg
Hungary to hold poll on Ukraine's EU accession, Orban says	Hungary will carry out an opinion survey on Ukraine&apos;s potential accession to the European Union, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced on March 7, according to Politico. &quot;We have the so-called national consultation scheme, which we use regularly to collect the opinion of the people, so we will use the same scheme just now,&quot; Orban told reporters after an emergency summit of EU leaders in Brussels. Orban, widely regarded as the EU&apos;s most pro-Russian leader, has repeatedly opposed military aid for Ukraine and warned that Ukraine&apos;s EU membership would &quot;destroy&quot; Hungary. He has maintained close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin despite Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, amplifying Kremlin narratives in Europe. Since 2010, Orban&apos;s government has held more than a dozen so-called national consultations on issues such as migration and LGBTQ rights. These referendums are non-binding letter campaigns sent to Hungarian voters with questions framed to align with the government&apos;s position. The political opposition and civil society groups have criticized these consultations as propaganda tools, pointing to their leading wording and low participation rates. For instance, a 2023 consultation on EU migration policy asked Hungarians if they supported Brussels&apos;s creation of &quot;migrant ghettos&quot; in Hungary. Less than 20% of voters participated, but 99% of those who did responded &quot;no.&quot; &quot;For the first time, Hungarians have a chance in Europe to decide whether they support Ukraine&apos;s EU membership or not,&quot; Hungary&apos;s government spokesperson Balazs Orban posted on X. Ukraine applied for EU membership in 2022 and was granted candidate status within months. Accession talks began in June 2024, with European leaders setting 2030 as a target for Ukraine&apos;s potential entry. Like all EU members, Hungary holds veto power over further progress, allowing Budapest to delay or block Ukraine&apos;s accession.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-to-hold-national-consultation-on-ukraines-eu-accession-orban-says/	2025-03-07T00:29:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190226673.jpg
2 killed, 24 injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over past day	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least two people and injured 24 others over the past day, regional officials reported on March 7. Russia carried out a mass missile and drone attack overnight, targeting infrastructure facilities in the Ternopil and Ivano-Frankivsk oblasts, according to officials. A Russian ballistic missile attack on Kharkiv injured eight people and damaged more than 30 houses, officials reported. Two of the injured were hospitalized. In Donetsk Oblast, 12 civilians were wounded, including six in Sloviansk, two in Kramatorsk and Bahatyr each, and one in Myrnohrad and Kostiantynivka, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian airstrikes killed two people and wounded one, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. In Poltava Oblast, debris from a downed aerial target struck a house, injuring two people, including a child, Governor Filip Pronin said. A 66-year-old man was wounded in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where 19 houses and apartments were damaged, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. Russia also carried out a large drone attack on Odesa Oblast, with officials still assessing potential casualties, Governor Oleh Kiper said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-over-past-day/	2025-03-06T23:38:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/photo_2025-03-07_07-36-52.jpg
EU leaders sideline Hungary as they pledge continued support for Ukraine	Twenty-six EU member states denounced Russian aggression and pledged continued support for Ukraine in a joint resolution issued at an emergency summit on March 6, despite Hungary dissenting. The lack of consensus on the declaration, which stopped short of committing concrete steps in support of Ukraine, underscores the persistent differences between Moscow-friendly Budapest and the rest of the bloc. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban can still block major decisions that require an anonymous vote, such as the six-month extension of sanctions against Russia. Speaking ahead of the summit, the EU&apos;s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, suggested that European countries might seek to push forward new support for Ukraine through a &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; to avoid Hungary&apos;s veto. &quot;The European Council reaffirms its continued and unwavering support for Ukraine&#x2019;s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders,&quot; the statement reads. The 26 EU members committed to several principles in pursuing a just peace in Ukraine, namely, Kyiv and Europe&apos;s participation in any negotiations, no ceasefire without a subsequent comprehensive peace agreement, security guarantees for Ukraine, and respect for Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The U.S.&apos;s outreach to Russia and bilateral talks on Ukraine in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 18 sparked concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump might seek to cut a deal with the Kremlin while sidelining Kyiv and Europe. &quot;Achieving &#x2018;peace through strength&#x2019; requires Ukraine to be in the strongest possible position, with Ukraine&#x2019;s own robust military and defence capabilities as an essential component,&quot; the statement reads. The declaration came as the EU agreed to mobilize up to 800 billion ($860 billion) for defense spending amid fears that the U.S. might scale back its presence on the continent. The Trump administration&apos;s decision to freeze military aid for Ukraine and intelligence sharing also highlighted Europe&apos;s growing role in sustaining Ukrainian resistance against Russian aggression. Despite this, the proposal to commit a new 20-billion-euro package ($22 billion) was dropped from the text of the declaration. The document reaffirmed that the EU would continue providing Ukraine with already pledged support in 2025, including 12.5 billion euros ($13.5 billion) under the Ukraine Facility and 18.1 billion ($19.6 billion) as part of the G7 loan covered by frozen Russian assets. To ensure the support of Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, the declaration also included calls on the European Commission, Slovakia, and Ukraine to &quot;intensify efforts towards finding workable solutions to the gas transit issue.&quot; Fico, who has adopted increasingly anti-Ukraine rhetoric but avoided blocking steps on the EU level in Orban&apos;s fashion, has repeatedly lambasted Kyiv over ending the transit of Russian gas through its territory to Slovakia and other EU countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-pledges-continued-support-for-ukraine-despite-hungarys-opposition/	2025-03-06T23:27:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203003580--1-.jpg
Russia lashes out against France's nuclear umbrella proposal	Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed on March 6 that French President Emmanuel Macron&apos;s recent comments on nuclear deterrence pose a threat to Russia, according to the state news agency TASS. During a televised address on March 5, Macron said he was open to extending France&apos;s nuclear umbrella to protect European allies amid growing uncertainties caused by the U.S.&apos;s foreign policy shifts. France and the U.K. are the only two European nations with nuclear arsenals. Macron made it clear that no decision has been taken so far. Lavrov claimed that Macron is &quot;preparing to use nuclear weapons against Russia,&quot; without providing evidence and despite the French leader not making such a statement directly. &quot;Of course, it&apos;s a threat against Russia,&quot; Lavrov claimed. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov echoed Lavrov&apos;s remarks, calling Macron&apos;s comments &quot;very confrontational&quot; and accusing France of escalating tensions. &quot;Moreover, France is already ready to use its nuclear weapons for security and the like. It&apos;s already such a nuclear rhetoric; it&apos;s a claim to nuclear leadership in Europe,&quot; Peskov said. Macron&apos;s statements come as European leaders push for increased defense spending and military aid to Ukraine amid concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump may not defend Europe if Russia attacks. Polish and Lithuanian leaders welcomed the French leader&apos;s proposal that Paris could extend its nuclear umbrella. Russia has been accused of waging a broader hybrid war against Europe, including acts of sabotage on the continent. Western intelligence agencies have warned that Moscow may seek to launch a large-scale war on Europe within the next five years.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-is-preparing-to-use-nuclear-weapons-against-russia-lavrov-claims/	2025-03-06T22:49:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1485172048.jpg
Ukraine struck Russian command post in Kherson Oblast, stronghold in Kursk Oblast on March 5	Ukrainian forces carried out precision strikes against a Russian command post in the occupied town of Oleshky in Ukraine&apos;s Kherson Oblast and a stronghold in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast on March 5, the Ukrainian military said on March 7. The attacks took place on the same day as the U.S. stopped sharing intelligence with Ukraine, which potentially undermines Kyiv&apos;s ability to carry out precision strikes. The statement did not specify whether the attacks occurred before the intelligence-sharing pause. Ukrainian forces reportedly attacked the command post of the 17th Tank Regiment of the 70th Motorized Rifle Division of the Russian Armed Forces stationed in the Russian-occupied part of Kherson Oblast. Russia was pushed back from the western part of Kherson Oblast during Ukraine&apos;s surprise counteroffensive in the fall of 2022 but continues to hold territory east of the Dnipro River. The March 5 strikes also targeted a stronghold of the 2nd company of Russia&apos;s 177th Separate Naval Infantry Regiment in Plekhovo in Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian forces have been fighting in the Russian border region since launching their incursion in August 2024 to draw Moscow&apos;s troops from Donbas and thwart Russian plans for further offensives. &quot;These strikes are part of an ongoing campaign of fire engagements aimed at reducing the military potential of the Russian Armed Forces on the way to liberating the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine,&quot; the General Staff said in its statement. &quot;The Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine remains fully prepared to conduct precision strikes to degrade the capabilities of the Russian Armed Forces in waging an aggressive war against the Ukrainian people.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-struck-russian-command-post-in-kherson-oblast-stronghold-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-03-06T22:26:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1068947954-1667598365khqfs.jpg

According to the report, Russia has also lost 10,264 tanks, 21,334 armored fighting vehicles, 39,678 vehicles and fuel tanks, 24,124 artillery systems, 1,306 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,096 air defense systems, 370 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 28,024 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-882-950-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-03-06T22:10:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1239116213-1660056573zl72q.jpg
Defense Secretary Hegseth hails UK for 'stepping up' as European leader on Ukraine amid shifting US foreign policy	During a meeting with his counterpart on March 6, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth hailed the United Kingdom for &quot;stepping up&quot; in taking a lead among European allies to support Ukraine. &quot;We are in the middle of a dynamic security environment, where on (the European) continent, President (Donald) Trump is calling on our European allies to take the lead, and you have done just that, sir,&quot; Hegseth told U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey during a press briefing in Washington. Hegseth further commended the U.K. for chairing the latest meeting of the Ukraine defense contact group: &quot;And that&apos;s, again, the United Kingdom stepping up,&quot; Hegseth added. Hegseth&apos;s comments come amid shifting political dynamics within the United States as the Trump administration has ruled out sending its own troops to Ukraine as a security guarantee for the embattled nation &#x2014; instead encouraging European allies to take the lead in securing Ukraine&apos;s post-war stability. &quot;You challenged us to step up on Ukraine, on defense spending, on European security. And I say to you that we have, we are, and we will further,&quot; Healey responded to Hegseth during the press briefing. Healey&apos;s comments come during the U.K. Defense Secretary&apos;s visit to the United States to discuss plans for peace in Ukraine. The meeting occurred as EU leaders were meeting in Brussels to discuss additional support for Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on March 2 that a number of European nations, including the U.K. and France, are developing a &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; that will include &quot;planes in the air and boots on the ground&quot; in an effort to negotiate a successful ceasefire in Ukraine. Reuters reported on March 6, citing diplomatic sources familiar with the matter, that France and the U.K. aim to finalize a peace plan with Ukraine &quot;in days&quot; to present to the United States. The comments from Hegseth come amid a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy, with Trump echoing Kremlin narratives and accusing President Volodymyr Zelensky of prolonging the war. In recent days, the United States has significantly distanced itself from Ukraine by halting military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv. The move follows a heated exchange in the Oval Office on Feb. 28 in which Zelensky and Trump got into an argument in front of reporters. Following the tense exchange, European leaders reaffirmed their support for Zelensky and Ukraine on Feb. 28 with EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas stating that &quot;Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It&apos;s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-defense-secretary-hegseth-hails-uk-for-stepping-up-on-ukraine/	2025-03-06T21:15:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/gettyimages-2203022644-612x612.jpg
Russia launches missile attack targeting critical infrastructure in various regions of Ukraine	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russian forces launched missiles at various regions of Ukraine overnight on March 7, targeting energy and gas infrastructure across the country, Ukraine&apos;s Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said. Halushchenko did not immediately say where critical infrastructure has been hit but noted &quot;rescuers and energy workers&quot; are on-scene to provide emergency restoration work. Russia initially launched a series of missiles around 4 a.m. local time targeting various regions in the country&apos;s far-west. A second series of missiles entered Ukrainian airspace around 6 a.m. Explosions were reported in the western city of Ternopil around 5 a.m. local time, following the first series of attacks, Suspilne reported. Later in the morning, explosions were heard in the front line city of Kharkiv around 6:30 a.m. Air defenses were active in all regions of Ukraine amid the missile threats. No information was immediately available as to the extent of the damage or whether there are any casualties. Russia has regularly launched missiles targeting various regions of the country. Russian forces have continuously targeted Ukraine&apos;s critical infrastructure as Russia continues to test Ukrainian resolve in the harsh winter months. Amid the U.S. pause on sharing intelligence with Kyiv, the New York Times reported on March 5, citing undisclosed U.S. and Ukrainian officials that the pause affects warnings against Russian drones and missiles striking Ukrainian military and civilian targets.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-missile-attack/	2025-03-06T20:40:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-76096673.jpg
Ukraine brought halts to military aid, intelligence sharing 'on themselves,' Kellogg says	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, suggested on March 6 that Ukraine was to blame for the U.S. halting military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv, saying that the embattled nation &quot;brought it on themselves.&quot; The Trump administration halted U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing for Ukraine this week following a heated exchange between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28. The decision are likely intended to put pressure on Zelensky in peace talks The halt in military aid leaves over $1 billion in weapons and ammunition undelivered to Kyiv, while the pause in intelligence sharing affects warnings against Russian drones and missiles striking Ukrainian military and civilian targets, Ukrainian and U.S. officials told the New York Times. &quot;The best way I can describe it is sort of like hitting a mule with a two-by-four across the nose,&quot; Kellogg said during a panel at the Council on Foreign Relations. &quot;You got their attention.&quot; Zelensky issued a statement on March 4 in which he called the Oval Office clash &quot;regrettable&quot; and affirmed commitment to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s leadership, after the White House questioned Zelensky&apos;s commitment to peace. &#x201C;Trump had a real question about whether President Zelensky was committed to the peace process, and he said let&#x2019;s pause,&#x201D; CIA Director John Ratcliffe said on March 5. Kellogg&apos;s comments come following his visit Kyiv on Feb. 20 where he lauded the &quot;positive discussions&quot; he held with Zelensky. &quot;Extensive and positive discussions with (Zelensky), the embattled and courageous leader of a nation at war, and his talented national security team,&quot; Kellogg wrote on X following the meeting. Earlier in the day on March 6, Kellogg said that the Istanbul talks can&apos;t serve as the basis for a Ukraine-Russia peace deal. The Istanbul agreements refer to negotiations between Ukraine and Russia held in Turkey in late March 2022, which outlined potential terms for a peace deal.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-brought-halts-to-aid-freeze-intelligence-sharing-on-themselves-kellogg-says/	2025-03-06T19:50:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1247741520.jpg
Norway to increase aid for Ukraine to $7.8 billion in 2025	Norway&apos;s parliamentary leaders agreed on March 6 to increase aid for Ukraine by 50 billion Norwegian krone ($4.6 billion) to a total of 85 billion Norwegian krone ($7.8 billion) in 2025. &quot;We are increasing support because there is a need for it, and it is a solid contribution to peace and stability in Europe,&quot; Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St&#xF8;re said following the agreement. &quot;It is a very, very high amount. It is needed in the defense struggle that Ukraine is in.&quot; Norway initially planned to allocate $2.1 billion for military aid to Ukraine in 2025 Although it was not immediately clear as to where the additional funds would be disbursed, Norwegian media outlet NRK reported that where the aid will be dictated by Ukraine&apos;s need. Norway has been one of Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters in Europe. Previously, St&#xF8;re announced on in December 2024 that the Nordic country will provide 2.7 billion Norwegian kroner ($242 million) to bolster Ukraine&apos;s navy and help it deter Russian threats in the Black Sea. Speaking to reporters about the new aid on March 6, St&#xF8;re also criticized actions taken by the Trump administration over the last week, including halting U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing for Ukraine. &quot;Ukraine is in a dramatic defensive battle against a sustained Russian attack. The changes in the United States have weakened support for Ukraine,&quot; St&#xF8;re said, adding that the situation was &quot;very sad.&quot; As the Nordic country&apos;s support for Ukraine continue, Norway previously pledged a new funding mechanism for Ukraine, the &quot;Norwegian model,&quot; meant to complement an existing &quot;Danish model&quot; of defense spending. The Danish model aims to purchase arms from Ukrainian manufacturers rather than providing materiel shipments.	https://kyivindependent.com/norway-to-increase-aid-to-ukraine-to-8-billion-in-2025/	2025-03-06T18:38:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1623063883.jpg
NATO could extend Article 5 protection to Ukraine without membership, Italian PM says	Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni suggested on March 6 that NATO could extend Article 5 protections to Ukraine without granting Kyiv membership in the alliance. The collective defense principle enshrined in NATO&apos;s Article 5 commits member nations to come to the defense of any other member state in the event of an attack. &quot;We need to think about more durable solutions&quot; than just sending European peacekeepers to Ukraine, Meloni said on the sidelines of the EU leaders&apos; meeting in Brussels. &quot;It&#x2019;s a different thing than entering NATO, but it implies extending the coverage that NATO countries have also to Ukraine,&quot; she added. European countries, led mainly by the U.K. and France, are developing a coalition of the willing to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. Various countries outside the EU including Canada, Australia, and Ireland have voiced their openness to partake in such a mission. NATO allies reaffirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible&quot; path toward NATO membership in July 2024, although member states have yet to provide Ukraine with a formal invitiation, despite numerous calls to do so. Meloni&apos;s comments come as the clearest indication of her position on Ukraine&apos;s potential security guarantees. The Italian prime minister, who has served potential conduit between European allies and the Trump administration, will not likely find support for the proposal in the United States. The U.S. has thus far welcomed the idea of European peacekeeping troops monitoring a potential ceasefire in Ukraine but has fallen short of offering concrete security guarantees. Meloni&apos;s comments in Brussels comes as European leaders have failed to say how Europe would provide lasting security guarantees without U.S. backing, amid steps taken by the U.S. to distance itself from Ukraine. When asked how Europe might provide security guarantees to Ukraine without a U.S. backstop, both European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen dodged specifics and pivoted to praising the Ukrainian military. &quot;The best security guarantee are the Ukrainians themselves,&quot; Costa said, highlighting the fact that Ukraine has been fighting Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion for over three years.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-could-extend-article-5-protection-to-ukraine-without-membership-italian-pm-says/	2025-03-06T17:43:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/DSC07739------.jpg
Best security guarantee is the Ukrainian army' — EU leaders dodge specifics on long-term peace plan	The European Union reaffirmed its &quot;continued and unwavering support&quot; for Ukraine at a special summit in Brussels on March 6, but failed to say how Europe would provide lasting security guarantees without U.S. backing. EU leaders convened in Brussels to discuss European and Ukrainian defense amid U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s decision to halt military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv. When asked how Europe might provide security guarantees to Ukraine without a U.S. backstop, both European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen dodged specifics and pivoted to praising the Ukrainian military. &quot;The best security guarantee are the Ukrainians themselves,&quot; Costa said, highlighting the fact that Ukraine has been fighting Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion for over three years. &quot;We stand for Ukraine since day one, and we will continue, and we will continue even after the war,&quot; he said. The EU plans to &quot;explore our capabilities in the treaty framework to contribute for security guarantees,&quot; Costa said, without describing any specific proposals. He reiterated that security guarantees are not only essential for peace in Ukraine, but for the security of all Europe and the restoration of the &quot;international rules-based order.&quot; Von der Leyen backed up Costa&apos;s remarks regarding Ukraine being its own best security assurance. &quot;(T)he best security guarantee is the Ukrainian army,&quot; she said. President Volodymyr Zelensky attended the special European Council, addressing EU leaders and meeting with Costa and von der Leyen. In his address, he said Ukraine needs &quot;a comprehensive agreement on security guarantees&quot; in order to accept a peace deal with Russia. In a statement released at the conclusion of the summit, the EU pledged to provide &quot;enhanced political, financial, economic, humanitarian, military, and diplomatic support to Ukraine&quot; while &quot;stepping up pressure on Russia.&quot; The statement also emphasizes the EU&apos;s commitment to deepening cooperation with Ukraine&apos;s defense industry and Armed Forces. &quot;A Ukraine capable of defending itself effectively is an integral part of any future security guarantees,&quot; it reads. In their remarks at the close of the summit, both von der Leyen and Costa were measured in their remarks regarding the U.S. shifts in foreign policy under the Trump administration. When asked how Europe might respond to increasing U.S. hostility, von der Leyen reiterated that a &quot;peace through strength&quot; was in everyone&apos;s best interests, including Trump&apos;s.	https://kyivindependent.com/best-security-guarantee-is-the-ukrainian-army-eu-leaders-dodge-specifics-on-long-term-peace-plan/	2025-03-06T15:58:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202554405.jpg
We've made a lot of progress' — Trump says US on track to peace deal with Ukraine, Russia	The United States has &quot;made a lot of progress&quot; with both Ukraine and Russia in recent days, U.S. President Donald Trump said on March 6. Trump has long promised to bring about a swift end to Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, though progress towards such a deal was disrupted after he ejected President Volodymyr Zelensky from the White House on Feb. 28 and claimed Ukraine was &quot;not ready for peace.&quot; Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House, Trump was once again optimistic about ending the war, saying his team had made progress over the past couple days. &quot;I will say that we&apos;ve made a lot of progress with Ukraine and a lot of progress with Russia over the last couple of days and it&apos;d be great to bring (the war) to an end,&quot; he said. Trump said that a quick end to the war would mean &quot;we don&apos;t have to talk that way, about nuclear&quot; &#x2014;&#xA0;a reference to French President Emmanuel Macron&apos;s recent statement about potentially extending nuclear protection to France&apos;s allies in Europe. &quot;It&apos;d be great if everybody would get rid of our nuclear weapons,&quot; Trump added. Trump also claimed that during his first term as U.S. president he got &quot;very far along a process with Russia&quot; towards a nuclear disarmament agreeement, despite the difficulties of what he called &quot;the Russia Russia Russia hoax.&quot; The Trump team came under investigation during his first term in office for potentially illegal ties with Russia. The special counsel report found evidence of &quot;extensive criminal activity,&quot; though it did not find evidence that Trump was directly working for, or had ever been recruited by, Russian security services. While Trump did not share details on the type of &quot;progress&quot; made with Russia and Ukraine, his remarks coincide with Zelensky&apos;s announcement that U.S and Ukrainian officials would meet for talks next week. Trump&apos;s envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, said the delegates would discuss a framework for a potential peace agreement in Saudi Arabia. The resumed cooperation comes after Zelensky issued a conciliatory statement calling the White House confrontation &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirming his willingness to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Trump read Zelensky&apos;s words aloud during his address to Congress on March 4, saying he appreciated the statement and had received &quot;strong signals&quot; that Russia was also ready to make a peace deal. Trump did not directly discuss the decision to freeze military aid to Kyiv in the address.	https://kyivindependent.com/weve-made-a-lot-of-progress-trump-says-us-on-track-to-peace-deal-with-ukraine-russia/	2025-03-06T14:17:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2201360456.jpg
No decision yet on revoking legal status of Ukrainian refugees in US, Trump says	The White House has not come to a decision yet regarding the legal status of 240,000 Ukrainian refugees currently living in the United States, U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on March 6. Earlier in the day, Reuters reported that the administration is planning to revoke the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) of these Ukrainians, potentially paving the way for their deportation. Trump said he had not made a decision on the matter yet, but planned to do so &quot;pretty soon.&quot; He also claimed that his administration did not want to hurt refugees from Ukraine. &quot;We&apos;re not looking to hurt anybody and we&apos;re certainly not looking to hurt them,&quot; Trump said. &quot;And I&apos;m looking at that, and there were some people that think that&apos;s appropriate and some people don&apos;t, and I&apos;ll be making a decision pretty soon. But we&apos;re not looking to hurt them. Especially Ukrainians. They&apos;ve gone through a lot.&quot; According to four undisclosed sources who spoke to Reuters, the plan to revoke TPS predates Trump&apos;s public argument with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28 and is part of the administration&apos;s broader crackdown on the more than 1.8 million people staying in the U.S. on humanitarian grounds. Later in the day, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed the report as &quot;fake news,&quot; claiming that no decision had been made. Trump, who campaigned intensively on promises to deport millions of migrants, began rolling back protections for Ukrainian and other refugees mere days after returning to the White House. In late January, the administration suspended the Uniting for Ukraine program, which allowed Ukrainians to stay in the U.S. for up to two years. The program also granted refugees the right to work and receive health insurance. Over 6 million Ukrainian citizens fled their homes in the wake of Russia&apos;s all-out invasion in 2022. Around 5.2 million remain abroad, with the vast majority receiving protection in EU countries. Trump&apos;s decision on TPS could affect 240,000 Ukrainian refugees in the U.S. The administration has come under scrutiny for its treatment of Ukraine, a longstanding ally, in contrast to its increasing warmth towards Russia. In recent days, the White House has frozen all military aid shipments and stopped intelligence sharing with Kyiv. Zelensky said on March 6 that the U.S. and Ukraine have resumed cooperation and that delegations will meet for talks next week.	https://kyivindependent.com/no-decision-yet-on-revoking-legal-status-of-ukrainian-refugees-in-us-trump-says/	2025-03-06T13:25:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194444069.jpg
US ready to go 'all in' on sanctions against Russia, treasury secretary says	The United States is prepared to go &quot;all in&quot; on sanctions against Russia in order to pressure Moscow to the negotiating table, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on March 6. Bessent&apos;s remarks come shortly after Reuters reported that the White House is considering a plan to ease sanctions against Russia as part of a deal to end the war in Ukraine. Speaking at the Economic Club of New York, Bessent criticized former U.S. President Joe Biden for imposing &quot;egregiously weak sanctions&quot; on Russia and said the current administration was prepared to enact harsher restrictions to gain leverage in upcoming talks. &quot;A major factor that has enabled the Russian war machine&apos;s continued financing was the Biden administration&apos;s egregiously weak sanctions on Russian energy, stemming from worries about upward pressure on U.S. energy prices,&quot; Bessent said. While Biden did impose sweeping restrictions on Russia&apos;s oil sector in the last month of his term, Bessent criticized the former president for taking such belated action. He said the increased sanctions would remain in effect and that U.S. President Donald Trump was willing to threaten more severe penalties. &quot;This administration has kept the enhanced sanctions in place and will not hesitate to go &apos;all in&apos; should it provide leverage in peace negotiations,&quot; he said. The Trump administration has faced outcry for its abrupt policy shift on Ukraine and its apparent friendliness towards the Kremlin. The reported plan to lift sanctions comes as the White House has canceled military aid to Ukraine and stopped intelligence sharing with Kyiv. Bessent&apos;s remarks seemed tailored to deflect some of this criticism, portraying the Biden administration as soft on Russia and emphasizing Trump&apos;s willingness to take a hard line. Sanctions on Moscow &quot;will be used explicitly and aggressively for immediate maximum impact,&quot; Bessent said. The treasury secretary also said the U.S. planned to intensify sanctions against Iran, which has supplied Russia with Shahed drones and short-range ballistic missiles, used in attacks on Ukrainian cities. &quot;We are going to shutdown Iran&apos;s oil sector and drone manufacturing capabilities,&quot; Bessent said. Shortly after his inauguration, Trump threatened to impose tariffs and sanctions on Russia to force their hand in negotiations, saying &quot;we can do it the easy way or the hard way.&quot; In the following weeks, Trump instead lashed out at Ukraine, claiming President Volodymyr Zelensky was &quot;not ready for peace&quot; and withholding critical U.S. support. Zelensky announced on March 6 that U.S. and Ukrainian delegations have resumed cooperation and will hold talks next week.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-ready-to-go-all-in-on-sanctions-against-russia-treasury-secretary-says/	2025-03-06T12:49:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2203649352.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine, US delegations to meet next week, Zelensky announces	Key developments on March 6: Ukraine and U.S. delegations have resumed work and are scheduled to meet next week, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced at the Special European Council on March 6. &quot;Ukraine is not only ready to take the necessary steps for peace, but we are also proposing what those steps are,&quot; Zelensky said, expressing hope for a &quot;meaningful&quot; dialogue with U.S. officials. Senior White House Fox News Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich wrote on X that the talks are set for March 11 and will involve Andriy Yermak, Zelensky&apos;s chief of staff. The U.S. delegation will reportedly include U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. &quot;The idea is to get down a framework for a peace agreement and an initial ceasefire as well,&quot; Witkoff later said outside the White House. He added that discussions are ongoing to finalize the meeting&apos;s location, with Riyadh or Jeddah under consideration. According to Axios, the meeting will take place on March 12. The announcement follows rising tensions between Kyiv and Washington after a heated Oval Office exchange between Zelensky, Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance on Feb. 28. The dispute derailed a planned bilateral deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources and led to Trump freezing all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. An agreement on Ukraine&apos;s mineral resources remains stalled as Trump seeks a &quot;bigger, better deal,&quot; CBS News reported on March 4. White House officials publicly indicated that Zelensky must issue an apology and demonstrate a commitment to peace talks for discussions to resume. On March 4, Zelensky called the White House clash &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his willingness to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Waltz suggested on March 5 that Trump may lift the pause on military aid once peace negotiations are arranged and confidence-building measures are taken, Reuters reported. The Istanbul talks can&apos;t serve as the basis for a Ukraine-Russia peace deal, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said on March 6. &quot;The Istanbul accords happened 30 days after the invasion, and the demands in Istanbul were fairly significant on a very weakened Ukraine,&quot; Kellogg said at the Council on Foreign Relations discussion. He described the agreements as a starting point for future negotiations but doubted they represented a fair framework for all parties. The Istanbul agreements refer to negotiations between Ukraine and Russia held in Turkey in late March 2022, which outlined potential terms for a peace deal. They included Ukraine adopting a neutral status, abandoning NATO aspirations, imposing military restrictions, and delaying negotiations over Russian-occupied Crimea&apos;s status for 10-15 years. Trump&apos;s envoy emphasized that conditions today differ significantly from those in 2022. He also noted that the Trump administration aims to reset U.S.-Russia relations, criticizing previous U.S. leadership for avoiding direct engagement with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kellogg&apos;s remarks follow U.S.-Russian talks in Istanbul on Feb. 27 and an earlier round in Riyadh on Feb. 18, which are part of Washington&apos;s push for a swift peace settlement. Trump expressed interest in meeting Putin, marking a stark departure from his predecessor, U.S. President Joe Biden, who had refused to engage with the Russian leader since the full-scale invasion began. Earlier, U.S. envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff suggested that the 2022 Istanbul agreements could serve as a foundation for a future Ukraine-Russia peace treaty. Despite his role as Trump&apos;s special envoy, Kellogg has been sidelined in recent peace efforts and excluded from both the Saudi and Turkish negotiations. Analysts suggest this may be due to his perceived pro-Ukraine stance and alleged Russian objections to his involvement. Military experts proposed to deploy European air forces to protect Kyiv and other non-front-line Ukrainian cities from Russian aerial attacks, the Guardian reported on March 6, citing the so-called Sky Shield plan. The plan could potentially work as part of the &quot;truce in the sky&quot; proposed by President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier this week, preventing missiles, long-range drones, and bombs from targeting civilian infrastructure. The project&apos;s supporters said it could be a European-led air defense zone involving 120 fighter jets that will operate separately from NATO. According to the plan, developed by former British Air Force planners in cooperation with Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, the protection zone would cover Ukraine&apos;s three operational nuclear power plants, as well as the cities of Odesa and Lviv in Ukraine&apos;s south and west. The country&apos;s east, where the fierce battles are ongoing in Donetsk Oblast, was not included in the zone. According to the authors, this step can be more tangible than the deployment of ground troops as peacekeepers. In February, the Washington Post reported that up to 30,000 European troops could be deployed in Ukraine after a potential ceasefire. Among those who supported the Sky Shield plan are Philip Breedlove, former NATO supreme commander in Europe, Polish ex-President Aleksander Kwasniewski, and Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania&apos;s former foreign minister. European defense ministries have considered the plan, but their leaders have been reluctant to authorize patrolling Ukrainian skies while Russia&apos;s full-scale war is ongoing, the Guardian wrote. In light of the U.S. policy shift and suspension of military aid to Ukraine, the initiative can be revisited, the news outlet noted. Yet, Western partners still fear an escalation if an aircraft from either side is attacked or shot down. Russian forces regularly launch drones and missiles against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, inflicting heavy civilian casualties. A Russian missile strike against a hotel in Kryvyi Rih late on March 5, carried out shortly after the U.S. paused vital intelligence sharing, killed four people and injured over 30. According to figures released by Kyiv, U.N. statistics, and open-source data published by BBC Russia, the total death toll of Ukrainian and Russian soldiers, as well as Ukrainian civilians, stood at over 148,000 as of mid-February. Ukraine has not yet received detailed information on U.S. intelligence-sharing restrictions but is already exploring alternatives, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on March 6, Interfax-Ukraine reported. &quot;We are already working on alternatives, including requesting (assistance) from Germany if necessary,&quot; Umerov said at a press conference in Berlin, following talks with German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. Washington cut off intelligence-sharing with Kyiv on March 5, following its decision to freeze all military aid to Ukraine as part of an effort to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine on U.S. terms. The intelligence cutoff threatens Ukraine&apos;s ability to track Russian military movements and detect aerial strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Reports suggest the U.S. may have also prohibited allies like the U.K. from passing on intelligence obtained through American sources. U.S. officials have indicated the pause could be temporary and contingent on progress toward peace talks. France has continued to provide military intelligence to Ukraine, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said on March 6, according to BFM TV. European leaders are expected to discuss additional support for Ukraine and increased defense spending at an EU summit in Brussels on March 6. President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Brussels for the emergency meeting, which was convened to address Europe&apos;s security strategy amid growing concerns over Washington&apos;s shifting foreign policy. The U.S. pause on sharing intelligence with Kyiv affects warnings against Russian drones and missiles striking Ukrainian military and civilian targets, the New York Times reported on March 5, citing undisclosed U.S. and Ukrainian officials. The U.S. stopped sharing intelligence with Ukraine on March 5, shortly after it froze all military assistance as part of an effort to pressure Kyiv into quick negotiations with Russia on U.S. terms. Russian forces regularly launch drones and missiles against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, inflicting heavy civilian casualties. A Russian missile strike against a hotel in Kryvyi Rih late on March 5, carried out shortly after the intelligence sharing pause, killed four people and injured at least 30. According to figures released by Kyiv, U.N. statistics, and open-source data published by BBC Russia, the total death toll of Ukrainian and Russian soldiers, as well as Ukrainian civilians, stood at over 148,000 as of mid-February. A senior Ukrainian official told the NYT that the pause in intelligence sharing would make it more difficult for Ukrainian forces to strike Russian targets. Kyiv still has access to other satellite imagery, they added. Valerii Kondratiuk, the former Ukraine&apos;s spy chief, said that intelligence sharing primarily involves the exchange of satellite images. While European companies have their own satellites, they are not focused on military movements, he added. Some unnamed U.S. officials voiced hope that any pause in intelligence sharing would be short and have little practical impact. A senior Trump administration official told the NYT the original plan was to suspend military and intelligence sharing for a week or two as part of a campaign to put pressure on President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to the NYT, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has a &quot;sizable presence&quot; in Ukraine, with some of its officers deployed in the country to help Ukraine with targeting. The CIA has also helped set up at least three secret signals intelligence collection bases that Ukraine uses to intercept Russian communications to reduce their reliance on U.S. intelligence, the newspaper reported.

‘He betrayed every one of us’ – US soldiers in Ukraine speak out after Trump’s military aid halt	Editor&#x2019;s note: In accordance with the security protocols of the Ukrainian military, soldiers featured in this story are identified by first names and callsigns only. American volunteer soldiers fighting in Ukraine say that they feel &#x201C;betrayed&#x201D; by their own country after the U.S. halted military aid and stopped sharing intelligence with Kyiv in early March. &#x201C;(U.S. President Donald Trump) betrayed every one of us,&#x201D; a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, who goes by the callsign Goldfish, told the Kyiv Independent. A few days after the heated Oval Office clash during President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s visit to Washington on Feb. 28, Trump froze the delivery of all U.S. military aid to Ukraine, worth billions, in a move to push Kyiv into peace talks with Russia. CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed on March 5 that the U.S. has also halted intelligence sharing with Ukraine, which could affect Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to identify Russian targets, as well as to defend itself from missile strikes. The American soldiers who spoke to the Kyiv Independent said they were &#x201C;horrified&#x201D; by their country&#x2019;s recent decisions and the ensuing consequences on the ground in Ukraine. With many of them fighting in Ukraine since 2022, they say watching their country take a major U-turn in Ukraine policy and soften toward Russia has been hurtful and deeply offensive, especially after losing comrades one after another to the war, including many Americans. &#x201C;Never have I ever thought that I would be listening to any U.S. public figure &#x2013; let alone the president &#x2013; openly declare support for an aggressor,&#x201D; Goldfish, a 33-year-old Alaskan currently serving with the 25th Airborne Brigade, said. &#x201C;If we stand here now on the side of the oppressor, literally telling Ukraine, either submit or cease to exist, that&apos;s not peace &#x2013; that&#x2019;s subjugation.&#x201D; U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office in Washington, D.C., U.S. on Feb. 10, 2025. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)While the exact number of U.S. volunteer soldiers fighting in various units in Ukraine is unknown to the public, at least 50, including about 40 U.S. military veterans, were killed in action as of February 2024, according to the American defense online publication Task &amp; Purpose. A 2025 CNN investigation revealed that more than 20 are missing in action on the front line. Understanding the significance of U.S. military aid and the immense sacrifice that Ukraine has already made to defend its country, some American fighters hoped that Trump wouldn&#x2019;t abandon Ukraine like that, soldier Levi Perez, 36, said. &#x201C;Deep down in our very souls, we knew it was coming,&#x201D; Perez, an Alaskan who goes by his callsign Joker, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Our reputation for the foreseeable future is pretty much gone,&#x201D; he said, noting that other Western countries are losing trust in the U.S. and may turn away from further political and economic ties. Perez and a few other American soldiers in Ukraine are convinced that Trump and his team&#x2019;s hasty moves are making the possibility of World War III inevitable, especially with China likely eyeing the moment to invade another sovereign nation. &#x201C;We are beyond the point of control (where we can avoid World War III) because Russia is not going to retreat completely, they won&apos;t give back the stolen territory, and Ukraine won&apos;t let them keep the territory,&#x201D; Perez said, referring to the roughly 20% of the Ukrainian land that Russia occupies. A surge in the Ukrainian troop losses is expected with the U.S. military aid freeze and the intelligence sharing halt, the American soldiers say. A former police officer from a southern city in the U.S. currently serving in the Ukrainian military says that he&#x2019;s most worried about the bans&#x2019; potential cost especially on the civilian lives. &#x201C;The civilians are going to suffer exponentially, almost more, because now with the lack of intelligence, we don&apos;t have as much information about rocket and drone strikes coming from Russian territory,&#x201D; the police officer-turned-soldier, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to his unit&#x2019;s protocols, told the Kyiv Independent. The most terrifying part is seeing how the U.S.&#x2019; next steps will impact Ukraine and its people, because &#x201C;Ukrainian people are incredible,&#x201D; according to a fellow American soldier, who goes by the callsign Gimli. &#x201C;The nightmare that keeps me up the most is whether my country will ever recover,&#x201D; Gimli, a 33-year-old former U.S. army serviceman from Washington, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Or if Trump and the Kremlin have completely crippled the future of my country.&#x201D; Gimli and other American soldiers said they had a completely different vision of their country&#x2014;a democratic nation they believed had always tried to do the right thing despite setbacks and to help the world as &#x201C;defenders of freedom.&#x201D; Now, they say they feel humiliated. &#x201C;I accepted the fact that I just may not have a country to go back to because I&#x2019;m not going to go back and live under a fascist regime,&#x201D; he said, adding that he hopes that &#x201C;the Ukrainians can forgive my people someday.&#x201D; The American soldiers interviewed said their hopes were now hanging on Europe to step up its support for Ukraine in what could be its darkest months to come. Goldfish, who received a near fatal injury in embattled Donetsk Oblast in the summer of 2023, said that &#x201C;Europe is the sleeping tiger in this war.&#x201D; &#x201C;I always thought it would be Russia that would just poke too far towards Europe or make too many threats. But it wasn&apos;t,&#x201D; Goldfish said. &#x201C;It was America that poked the tiger and woke it up.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-soldiers-in-ukraine-trumps-military-aid-halt/	2025-03-06T11:59:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2197496691.jpg
Eutelsat in talks with EU to possibly replace Starlink in Ukraine, CEO confirms	French satellite operator Eutelsat Communications is in advanced talks with the European Union to possibly replace tech billionaire Elon Musk&apos;s Starlink in Ukraine, Bloomberg reported on March 6. &quot;Everyone is asking us today, &apos;Can you replace the large number of terminals of Starlink in Ukraine,&apos; and we are looking at that,&quot; Eutelsat CEO Eva Berneke told Bloomberg. Eutelsat, which already operates in Ukraine, has thousands of terminals deployed, although not all are connected to the network. Starlink has played a vital role in Ukraine&apos;s battlefield communications, with around 42,000 terminals providing service to the military, medical facilities, businesses, and aid organizations. Berneke said the company is in discussions with suppliers to provide both military-grade and standard terminals and would need &quot;a couple of months&quot; to supply 40,000 units. Concerns over Starlink&apos;s availability escalated after the U.S. paused military aid to Ukraine on March 3. Reuters reported that U.S. officials have raised the possibility of restricting Ukraine&apos;s access to Starlink. Musk, who owns Starlink and has close ties to U.S. President Donald Trump, denied the intention to turn off the terminals. Eutelsat&apos;s proposal combines OneWeb&apos;s low Earth orbit satellites, positioned around 1,200 kilometers (746 miles) above the surface, with its geostationary satellites at 35,000 kilometers (21,748 miles). The dual-constellation approach could provide essential connectivity for Ukraine&apos;s military, including for drone operations that have inflicted significant losses on Russian forces. OneWeb already provides services to Ukraine through a German distributor, but scaling up would require European governments to approve procurement and integration plans. The European Commission is assessing ways to help Ukraine secure satellite communications in case Starlink access is restricted, Politico reported on March 3.	https://kyivindependent.com/eutelsat-in-talks-with-eu-to-possibly-replace-starlink-in-ukraine-ceo-confirms/	2025-03-06T11:37:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1775225270.jpg
Ukrainian, US delegations to discuss peace framework in Saudi Arabia, Witkoff says	Ukrainian and U.S. delegations are set to discuss the framework for a potential peace agreement next week in Saudi Arabia, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, told reporters on March 6. &quot;The idea is to get down a framework for a peace agreement and an initial ceasefire as well,&quot; Witkoff said outside the White House. He added that discussions are ongoing to finalize the meeting&apos;s location, with Riyadh or Jeddah under consideration. President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed on March 6 at the European Council that Ukraine and the U.S. have resumed talks and preparing for a meeting. &quot;Ukraine is not only ready to take the necessary steps for peace, but we are also proposing what those steps are,&quot; he said. Senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich wrote on X that the meeting is scheduled for March 11, with Ukraine&apos;s delegation led by Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff, Andriy Yermak. The U.S. delegation will reportedly include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, and Witkoff. According to Axios, the meeting will take place on March 12. Earlier, on March 5, Yermak wrote on Telegram that he and Waltz had discussed &quot;further steps toward a just and lasting peace. &quot; Tensions between Kyiv and Washington escalated following a heated Oval Office exchange between Zelensky, Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance on Feb. 28. The dispute led to the collapse of a bilateral agreement on Ukraine&apos;s mineral resources and prompted Trump to freeze all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. The mineral deal remains stalled, with CBS News reporting on March 4 that Trump is seeking a &quot;bigger, better deal.&quot; White House officials have publicly signaled that Zelensky must issue an apology and commit to peace talks for discussions to resume. On March 4, Zelensky called the White House confrontation &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his willingness to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Waltz suggested on March 5 that Trump may lift the pause on military aid once peace negotiations are arranged and confidence-building measures are taken, Reuters reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-us-delegations-to-discuss-peace-framework-in-saudi-arabia-trump-s-envoy-says/	2025-03-06T11:14:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2199709214.jpg
Istanbul talks can't serve as basis for Ukraine-Russia peace deal, Kellogg says	The Istanbul talks can&apos;t serve as the basis for a Ukraine-Russia peace deal, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said on March 6. &quot;The Istanbul accords happened 30 days after the invasion, and the demands in Istanbul were fairly significant on a very weakened Ukraine,&quot; Kellogg said at the Council on Foreign Relations discussion. He described the agreements as a starting point for future negotiations but doubted they represented a fair framework for all parties. The Istanbul agreements refer to negotiations between Ukraine and Russia held in Turkey in late March 2022, which outlined potential terms for a peace deal. They included Ukraine adopting a neutral status, abandoning NATO aspirations, imposing military restrictions, and delaying negotiations over Russian-occupied Crimea&apos;s status for 10-15 years. Trump&apos;s envoy emphasized that conditions today differ significantly from those in 2022. He also noted that the Trump administration aims to reset U.S.-Russia relations, criticizing previous U.S. leadership for avoiding direct engagement with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kellogg&apos;s remarks follow U.S.-Russian talks in Istanbul on Feb. 27 and an earlier round in Riyadh on Feb. 18, which are part of Washington&apos;s push for a swift peace settlement. Trump expressed interest in meeting Putin, marking a stark departure from his predecessor, U.S. President Joe Biden, who had refused to engage with the Russian leader since the full-scale invasion began. Earlier, U.S. envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff suggested that the 2022 Istanbul agreements could serve as a foundation for a future Ukraine-Russia peace treaty. Despite his role as Trump&apos;s special envoy, Kellogg has been sidelined in recent peace efforts and excluded from both the Saudi and Turkish negotiations. Analysts suggest this may be due to his perceived pro-Ukraine stance and alleged Russian objections to his involvement.	https://kyivindependent.com/istanbul-agreements-not-basis-for-ukraine-russia-peace-deal-trumps-kellogg-says/	2025-03-06T11:03:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1228656063.jpg
As protests engulf Serbia, President Vucic looks for support East and West	Editor&apos;s Note: Following a number of attacks against peaceful protestors in Serbia, the Kyiv Independent agreed to not publish the last names of people who gave comments for this story. BELGRADE, Serbia &#x2014; Thousands of protestors walked 300 kilometers on March 1 from Belgrade to the southern city of Nis to rally support for an anti-corruption protest that took aim at the ruling party. Serbia&apos;s Russia-friendly President Aleksandar Vucic has often used a Kremlin playbook to discredit the protests that occasionally rise in a country balancing between Russia and the West. Such a balancing act has been increasingly difficult to maintain. Nis, the country&apos;s third largest city home to 250,000, has long been President Vucic&apos;s core voting stronghold along other cities and towns further away from the capital. Yet, residents who greeted the arriving protesters said they were tired of their ruling party and wanted to listen to what young people have to say. The Serbian protests began in November after a train station roof in the town of Novi Sad collapsed, killing 15 people. This roof had been hastily reconstructed in 2024 with Chinese and state funds and a procurement procedure widely viewed as corrupt. Students took to the streets, demanding accountability and justice for the victims. They used a bloody hand symbol to highlight how corruption in Serbia cost lives. Vucic had been actively blaming the upheaval on the West, saying that foreign forces have been attempting to spark a &quot;Ukrainian-style revolution in Serbia.&quot; The protestors, however, aren&apos;t pro-Ukrainian or anti-Russian, and are united primarily by their opposition to the current government rather than broader ideological takes. Protests in Serbia have gone on for over 100 days in 60 different settlements. Students, farmers and businesses continue to strike in support. Universities, some of which are now closed, are used as base-camps for democratic decision-making among the students. Alexander, a student who took part in daily marches, said the protesters remain hopeful. &quot;We really feel like we can change something this time,&quot; he said.

(Andrej Isakovic / AFP via Getty Images)The movement follows a pattern. Students announce a mass rally in a Serbian city, then walk to that location for days. Along the way they talk to locals to gather support for the movement. A taxi driver in Nis on March 1 said his views had changed since seeing the protestors in the flesh, rather than on state TV where they are routinely denigrated. &quot;In the Balkans, children are always taught to listen to their elders. But now we are listening to them. They are teaching us to stand up for our rights,&quot; he said. The pro-democracy movement is changing Serbia&apos;s image. Protesters seek respect for the rule of law, a free press and, fair elections, and an end to widespread corruption. So far, the protests have prompted Vucic to publicly oust Prime Minister Milos Vucevic and Transport Minister Darko Glisic, both of whom remain in their place as they await a vote in parliament. Arrests of several company heads and policemen in what Vucic has called a &quot;fierce fight against corruption&quot; had also taken place. Protestors, however, show a deep skepticism towards Vucic&apos;s proposed anti-corruption measures which are widely seen to be a last ditch attempt to cling to power. Students interviewed by the Kyiv Independent expressed deep frustration with the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), blaming it for the country&apos;s lack of media freedom, rigged elections, and neglect of public services and civil liberties. Andjela, 22, a student protestor, said, &quot;The whole ruling party should resign. They&apos;ve shown they are unfit to run the country. We haven&apos;t had free elections in my lifetime. It&apos;s unsafe here, incomes are low, prices are high, and criminals go unpunished, including the thugs who beat up students.&quot; A woman holds a placard reading &quot;Smells like corruption spirit&quot; during a demonstration in Belgrade, Serbia, on Jan. 24, 2025.

(Andrej Isakovic / AFP / Getty Images)The latest election, in 2023, was seen as being widely rigged, with 50,000 voters from the Republika Srpska, a ethnic Serbian enclave of Bosnia, were bussed to Belgrade to sway the vote. Mass protests followed, but they led to no change. A year later, a new protest movement was built on years of unresolved discontent. In the aftermath of the Kosovo War of 1999, a mass student-led movement called OTPOR brought down the country&apos;s autocrat, Slobodan Milosevic. Srecko Mihailovi&#x107;, a veteran protester of the OTPOR movement, said that he&apos;s been on marches for 30 years and hopes he won&apos;t be doing it to the grave. &quot;We&apos;ve had the same president for 10 years, this is not normal,&quot; he said. &quot;But we need to show that Serbia isn&apos;t Vucic.&quot; Vucic&apos;s response to the protests has been chaotic. The president claimed, without evidence, that outside forces are behind the protests and has accused the West of trying to incite a revolution. At the same time, Vucic had told EU leaders that &quot;Putinists&quot; are trying to stir up trouble to deepen the country&apos;s ties with Russia. On Jan. 20, Serbian police detained 14 foreign nationals at an NGO summit in Belgrade. Such tactics have been used by the ruling party since 2012. State tabloids bully critics of the government, illegally publish their personal data online, and incite violence against those who oppose the government. Authorities have also been linked to hooligan groups that stir up trouble during protests to justify police action. A similar tactic was used during the 2013-14 EuroMaidan Revolution in Ukraine, when the pro-Kremlin government employed thugs to fight with protesters, coining the term Titushky.

(Tadija Anastasjevic / AFP / Getty Images)Andjela, who took part in protests, noted that this year&apos;s protesters are alert for provocateurs. A protester was beaten up, while other students were rammed with cars and hospitalized, she said. &quot;We are careful in case it escalates and more of our students end up in the hospital,&quot; Andjela added. At present, there doesn&apos;t seem to be a solution to the political crisis. Student protesters know their government&apos;s playbook well, so they tread carefully. They appeal to patriotism and wave only Serbian flags to avoid appearing influenced by outsiders. So far, the careful approach has united support across societal sectors, including the rural population, who were once Vucic&apos;s core base. Farmers brought tractors to protect students, blocking key Belgrade bridges. The rallies have also gained international support from students in the U.S., Austria, Croatia, and vocal celebrity support from tennis superstar Novak Djokovic and Madonna. The countrywide solidarity has reduced citizens&apos; fears of government-sponsored attacks, threats to family members, and job losses, which previously weakened protests in 2012, 2020, and 2023. Boris, an engineering student taking part in protests, said, &quot;This time we don&apos;t fear the government. They should fear us.&quot; The question remains what would follow were the government to call a snap election to ease the crisis. Boris said that he would like to see an interim government of &quot;democracy experts and professionals&quot; in place who could create the conditions for fair, free elections. At present, students do not have a plan to back a political candidate. They have distanced themselves from opposition parties as they view them as part of the system they are up against. Up until now, the official opposition had been fragmented and cautious. Opposition party members &quot;have nothing to do with the organization&quot; and support the protests &quot;as civilians only,&quot; said lawmaker Borko Stefanovic, deputy president of the Party of Freedom and Justice. &quot;The regime could misuse this, saying the opposition is behind the protests. But the students lead.&quot; A fight broke out between opposition and ruling party members in the Serbian National Assembly over the Novi Sad train station tragedy in Belgrade, Serbia, on Nov. 25, 2024. (Filip Stevanovic / Anadolu / Getty Images)On March 4, some unconventional action was taken in parliament. Lawmaker Radomir Lazovic of the Green-Left front voiced support for the protestors and launched fireworks in the Serbian parliament, which hospitalized three people. A brawl ensued between opposition and ruling party members. &quot;A clear message was sent that we do not accept the institutional violence of the Serbian Progressive Party, which has been carried out for years. The only agenda item at the Serbian parliament sitting can be the fulfillment of students&apos; demands,&quot; Lazovic said. Yet, a new election might not be the solution the protestors are hoping for. &quot;No elections would work under current conditions and without a free press. Vucic would steal and rig another election,&quot; Stefanovic said. The countrywide support for change in Serbia, however, doesn&apos;t mean those on the street agree on policy and their country&apos;s alignment. Though EU leaders expressed admiration and support, the absence of EU flags in the crowd is deliberate. Potestors see their cause as a local concern they must deal with within-country. An IPSOS poll in December 2024 revealed that only 46% of Serbs would support EU membership in a referendum. Many protesters feel the EU and U.S. leaders have emboldened Vucic following years of hostilities in the region. Many also dislike the West for their handling of the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s. The EU has worked with Vucic on ammunition exports, with $800 million in Serbian ammunition ending up in Ukraine through Western intermediaries. In July 2024, the Serbian government granted the EU access to its large lithium reserves. This also sparked thousands of Serbs to come out in protest, citing environmental concerns. Vucic has also gained favor with U.S. President Donald Trump by allowing his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to build a hotel in central Belgrade on top of a war memorial. Residents of Belgrade viewed the proposal with hostility. Anti-Western sentiments have long united Serbia with Russia, even though the Serbian population continues to migrate west for education and work. This connection dates back to the 19th century when the Russian Empire helped secure Serbia&apos;s independence from the Ottoman Empire. It was also bolstered by a common religion and church ties. Today, the bond is fuelled by anger over NATO&apos;s 1999 bombing of Belgrade to end President Milosevic&apos;s war against Kosovo. Serbia, backed by Russia, still claims Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008. Serbia maintains a broad conservative, Orthodox streak with strong anti-LGBTQ+ views. Many Serbs see Western nations as too &quot;liberal.&quot; In contrast, many who came of age during the 1990s view Russian President Vladimir Putin as &quot;a strong leader&quot; pushing back against the West. A 2023 poll by the Henry Jackson Society showed that over 61% of Serbs reported no change in their positive views on Russia since the start of the all-out war in Ukraine, and 21.7% said their support for Russia has increased.

Z t-shirts and Putin mugs are sold in central markets. Serbian and Russian flags and &quot;Zajedno (together)&quot; signs are widespread. Since 2022, mercenaries from far-right groups have been traveling to Russia to fight against Ukraine. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Serbia has welcomed up to 300,000 Russians fleeing the war. When these Russians share anti-Putin views, it can prompt strong reactions from the locals. Nino, who owns a cigar lounge in Belgrade, said, &quot;God has given us the gift of these liberal Russians. We&apos;ll show them the true path and send them back home, more Russian than ever!&quot; But attitudes in the capital, Belgrade, have shifted as an influx of wealthy Russian IT-workers has slowly undermined the imagined &apos;Slavic Orthodox brotherhood.&quot; Many Belgraders now resent recent Russian immigrants for not integrating, driving up housing prices and gentrifying the city with expensive shops and restaurants packed by foreigners. Students protesting in the streets say neither the EU nor Russia will do anything to help them. While many still express emotional ties to Russian culture, they say they do not wish to live in a Putin-style political system.	https://kyivindependent.com/as-protests-engulf-serbia-president-vucic-struggles-to-play-both-sides/	2025-03-06T10:49:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2183585364.jpg
BREAKING: Ukraine, US delegations resume work, to meet next week, Zelensky announces	Ukraine and U.S. delegations have resumed work and are scheduled to meet next week, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced at the Special European Council on March 6. &quot;Ukraine is not only ready to take the necessary steps for peace, but we are also proposing what those steps are,&quot; Zelensky said, expressing hope for a &quot;meaningful&quot; dialogue with U.S. officials. Senior White House Fox News Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich wrote on X that the talks are set for March 11 and will involve Andriy Yermak, Zelensky&apos;s chief of staff. The U.S. delegation will reportedly include U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. According to Axios, the meeting will take place on March 12. The announcement follows rising tensions between Kyiv and Washington after a heated Oval Office exchange between Zelensky, Trump, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance on Feb. 28. The dispute derailed a planned bilateral deal on Ukraine&apos;s natural resources and led to Trump freezing all military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. An agreement on Ukraine&apos;s mineral resources remains stalled as Trump seeks a &quot;bigger, better deal,&quot; CBS News reported on March 4. White House officials publicly indicated that Zelensky must issue an apology and demonstrate a commitment to peace talks for discussions to resume. On March 4, Zelensky called the White House clash &quot;regrettable&quot; and reaffirmed his willingness to work toward peace under Trump&apos;s &quot;strong leadership.&quot; Waltz suggested on March 5 that Trump may lift the pause on military aid once peace negotiations are arranged and confidence-building measures are taken, Reuters reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-us-delegations-to-meet-next-week-zelensky-announces/	2025-03-06T09:58:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202968684.jpg
The war continues because of Russia' – Zelensky's full speech at European Council	Editor&apos;s note: This is the transcript of President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s address to the Special European Council released by the President&apos;s Office on March 6. President Costa! President von der Leyen! Dear colleagues, glad to see you all. I&#x2019;ve already spoken to many of you these days and weeks, and I am grateful for your support. Ukrainians really appreciate that in a time of such great emotions in global politics, European integrity is preserved, and Europe is really trying to do the right thing. First. I want to inform all of you that our teams &#x2013; Ukraine and America &#x2013; have resumed work. We hope that next week we will have a meaningful meeting. Ukraine has been seeking peace since the very first second of the war, and we have always said that the only reason why the war continues is because of Russia. Ukraine is not only ready to take the necessary steps for peace, but we are also proposing what those steps are. And I ask you to support us in this &#x2013; support Ukraine and those European leaders who are helping to pave the way for peace. We see several steps now. Everyone needs to make sure that Russia, as the sole source of this war, accepts the need to end it. This can be proved by two forms of silence that are easy to establish and monitor, namely, no attacks on energy and other civilian infrastructure &#x2013; truce for missiles, bombs, and long-range drones, and the second is truce on the water, meaning no military operations in the Black Sea. The next step is basic trust to the circumstances in which the negotiations are taking place. Ukrainians, all Europeans, Americans, every human heart in the world that does not agree with the war &#x2013; we all need to feel that the Russians are not deceiving us. The release of prisoners can be a means of establishing basic trust. And this should be based on the understanding that any truce and any form of trust building measures can only be a prologue to a full and fair settlement, to a comprehensive agreement on security guarantees and an end to the war. Let me emphasize once again that Ukrainians do really want peace, but not at the cost of giving up Ukraine. Is Russia capable of giving up the war &#x2013; this is the question that any negotiations must answer. And please be sure that Ukraine will share all the details of peace plans and talks&#x2019; process to all of Europe, every European nation that helps must be on board on the path to peace. Second. I urge you to continue to support the position that any issues related to Ukraine&#x2019;s security should be resolved with Ukraine&#x2019;s participation, just as any issues related to the security of your nations or any issues related to the security of our entire Europe should be resolved with your participation. Only this can guarantee peace on the continent and respect for the interests of all European states. That is why we are trying to ensure that European interests are represented. Anything that affects the security of Europe should be resolved with the participation of Europe. Third. I thank you for your determination to help us defend Ukraine. Every day and every night we have to protect lives. Russian ballistic missiles continue to strike our cities. The shelling at the front continues. Russian sabotage groups are still trying to enter our territory across the border in Sumy and Kharkiv regions. Moscow is not reducing its investment in death, increasing its army, and making no pauses in trying to overcome sanctions. Russia now has 220 brigades with war experience. In five years, they will bring this number to 300. We need to respond to this by taking care of lives now, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. I welcome the European Commission&#x2019;s efforts to re-arm Europe and the Rearm Europe Plan is the right initiative. The defense funds under this European Plan should strengthen all parts of Europe, and I call for a significant part to be allocated to arms production in Ukraine &#x2013; our industrial capabilities are the fastest and most relevant to the current security threats. I welcome the efforts of my European colleagues &#x2013; and this is not just about the EU, but about Europe in a broad sense &#x2013; to increase national defense spending and modernize national armies. Everyone in Europe needs this. When we agree on the format of the Armed Forces of Europe, this format will rely on the strength of national armies and on the experience of deploying partner contingents in Ukraine, which is what we are now working on. I also welcome the investments of all partners in the defense industry &#x2013; in Ukraine and in your countries, the industrial base of Europe must grow. Europe should become the place where the most technologically advanced and effective weapons in the world are produced, and this is not a fantasy if Europeans really set themselves this goal. And a few more things. I&#x2019;m grateful to you for the 16th EU sanctions package, and we must continue this pressure. We need a 17th sanctions package. The sanctions should work until Russia stops the occupation. I know that a special European financial instrument for Ukraine&#x2019;s resilience is being developed, please speed up this work. In all these circumstances, it is needed to speed up the work of our teams in the negotiations on Ukraine&#x2019;s membership in the EU. As of now, the work on clusters is actually blocked without any rational reason. We need common sense, we need to unblock the work on clusters, and this can be done at the leadership level. Thank you.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelenskys-full-speech-at-european-council/	2025-03-06T09:46:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/5ab191f76b8eff4926200ac7d107cf74_1741277568.jpeg
‘Peace’ with Russia already means a steady stream of hybrid attacks on the US and Europe	With every day of the new White House administration that passes, the chances of Russia being brought in from the cold on the international stage after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine appear to be increasing. U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s ongoing Kremlin charm campaign has seen Ukraine and Europe sidelined in peace negotiations, reports that sanctions against Moscow could be lifted, and even accusations from top Democrats that the U.S. is actively siding with Russia. Experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent say the U.S.&apos;s new stance ignores one crucial thing &#x2014; Vladimir Putin&apos;s Russia does not, and never has wanted, truly peaceful relations with the West and has been engaged in a hybrid war with it for decades. Putin&#x2019;s hybrid assaults on the West have included assassinations abroad, the egregious jailing of foreigners in Russia, the funneling of weapons and facilitation of corruption, and, of course, an infamous army of hackers who carry out cyberattacks. Conflict with the West is &quot;the foundation of (Putin&#x2019;s) rule now,&quot; John Foreman, CBE, a former UK defence attach&#xE9; in both Kyiv and Moscow, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;If you&apos;ve got the foreign bogey &#x2014; you know, Anglo-Saxons, the predatory West, fascist Ukrainians, puppet states and all that &#x2014; that&apos;s the justification for why you have to be in power indefinitely, why Russian freedoms are being crushed and why there&apos;s no free media.&quot; Foreman was stationed in Moscow in the immediate aftermath of the poisoning of Soviet defector Sergey Skripal in Salisbury, an event he says sealed U.K. hostility towards the Russian government after a long history of hybrid attacks on NATO members. Regardless of Trump&#x2019;s planned peace deal with Russia, that campaign, he said, &quot;will endure, because the wider conflict with the West and with Ukraine is about dividing us to achieve political goals.&quot; &quot;So why would Putin stop that?&#x201D; Lauri Luht is currently Estonia&#x2019;s cyber attach&#xE9; in Kyiv. He recalled waking up during a 2007 cyber attack to find government websites, including that of the border service for which he worked at the time, shut down and an email inbox choked with junk. Those attacks &#x2014; which struck as Estonia removed a Soviet monument from Tallinn &#x2014; were one of the first times Russian actors had weaponized cyberspace for geopolitical aims. A distributed-denial-of-service attack like the 2007 hit on Estonia is almost quaint today. In subsequent years, Russia&#x2019;s cyber arsenal has &quot;grown so vicious,&#x201D; Luht said. &quot;And the problem, of course, is that the best cyber attacks still remain invisible,&quot; Luht told the Kyiv Independent. Like Foreman, he sees no reason to think Russia will stop. &quot;Ukraine is the primary focus of Russia right now, but that doesn&apos;t mean that they don&apos;t have others in their focus,&quot; Luht said. &quot;The (cyber) attacks which are carried out against Ukraine today might be already happening or might happen tomorrow against others.&quot; Trump&apos;s warming relations with Russia threaten NATO&#x2019;s fundamental protections, said Dr. Jan Kallberg, a research scientist and associate professor at West Point. &quot;I believe the Russians, energized by the internal belief that Trump will save them, will start testing Article 5 in a systematic manner to trigger a slippery slope undermining NATO,&quot; Kallberg told the Kyiv Independent. Kallberg added this could take many forms but used the hypothetical example of false Kremlin claims of Norwegian border guards crossing the border into Russia. In this example, Russian forces could open fire on actual Norwegian guards manning the border, prompting Norway to invoke Article 5. Kallberg said it&apos;s unlikely that NATO would declare war on Russia over such an incident, so faith in NATO as a reliable defensive mechanism would be thrown into question. &quot;Five to ten of these provocations and Article 5 is undermined. Then Russia has succeeded,&quot; he said. Trump&#x2019;s current courting of Putin for a peace deal neglects that Russian agents have obliquely attacked the U.S. and NATO with relative impunity for almost 20 years. Russia has shown little respect for NATO and its Article 5, nor for the borders, security, or interests of any country that is not Russia. Below is an incomplete timeline of Putin-era hybrid attacks on NATO nations. The total number of such attacks will never be known &#x2014; Western computer systems silently fall victim to Russian cyber gangs every day. A Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) agent who investigated organized crime, Litvinenko fled Russia for the U.K. after growing critical of Putin. He was later poisoned by FSB agents in London with polonium-210, leading to a slow and painful death and Putin&#x2019;s first major hybrid incursion into the West. Alexander Litvinenko is pictured in the Intensive Care Unit of University College Hospital in London, U.K., on Nov. 20, 2006, in this image made available on Nov. 25, 2006. The 43-year-old former KGB spy, who died on Nov. 23, 2006, accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of poisoning him. Litvinenko died after radioactive polonium-210 was found in his body. Russia&apos;s foreign intelligence service denied any involvement in the case. (Natasja Weitsz / Getty Images)2007: Estonia cyber attackThree years after joining NATO, Estonia relocated a Soviet statue from the center of Tallinn. A massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack roiled the country&#x2019;s digital infrastructure for almost a month, an attack that was subsequently connected to pro-Kremlin but formally independent cyber gangs. The Russian Air Force ran training missions over the Baltic Sea, 35 kilometers from the Swedish border, including a simulated attack on military targets in and around Stockholm.

While the CIA at the time said it had &#x201C;low to moderate confidence&#x201D; in that intel, 2025 investigations from Germany&#x2019;s Der Spiegel and Russian dissident outlet the Insider identified individuals involved in a scheme to pay $200,000 per dead soldier. Russian agent Maria Butina used affairs with well-connected conservatives like political operative Paul Erickson and Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne to infiltrate Republican groups like the National Rifle Association. After pleading guilty to acting as an unregistered agent, she served a year and a half in jail. Today, Butina is a member of Russia&#x2019;s parliament. As part of a broader cyber campaign against the West, Russian government actors hacked the Democratic National Convention&#x2019;s servers as well as then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s campaign staff, releasing tens of thousands of emails through WikiLeaks. The hack followed a public statement from then-candidate Donald Trump calling on anyone who could to get a hold of Clinton&#x2019;s emails, which would lead Trump to spend subsequent years denying collusion with Moscow. Montenegro&#x2019;s NATO accession was rife with Russian threats of &quot;active measures&quot; to stop the longtime Balkan ally from joining the block. In 2016, Montenegrin authorities accused 13 Montenegrins, Serbians, and Russians of planning an armed coup, though those charges were dropped in 2024. During the Battle of Khasham, around 500 pro-Assad forces, including Wagner mercenaries, attacked 40 U.S. Special Forces who had turned a derelict oil refinery into an outpost while fighting ISIS. U.S. airstrikes killed 200-300 members of the Syrian coalition, while taking no casualties.

DarkSide, a ransomware gang believed to be based in Russia, hit the networks behind an oil pipeline that paralyzed energy supplies along the U.S. East Coast. An arms channel between Russia and Iran has for years provided Russian weapons to Iran-backed militant groups ranging from Hezbollah in Lebanon to the Houthis in Yemen, which have at various points targeted U.S bases and embassies as well as Western shipping in the Gulf of Aden.

Ukraine working on alternatives to US intelligence, defense minister says	Ukraine has not yet received detailed information on U.S. intelligence-sharing restrictions but is already exploring alternatives, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on March 6, Interfax-Ukraine reported. &quot;We are already working on alternatives, including requesting (assistance) from Germany if necessary,&quot; Umerov said at a press conference in Berlin, following talks with German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. Washington cut off intelligence-sharing with Kyiv on March 5, following its decision to freeze all military aid to Ukraine as part of an effort to end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine on U.S. terms. The intelligence cutoff threatens Ukraine&apos;s ability to track Russian military movements and detect aerial strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Reports suggest the U.S. may have also prohibited allies like the U.K. from passing on intelligence obtained through American sources. U.S. officials have indicated the pause could be temporary and contingent on progress toward peace talks. France has continued to provide military intelligence to Ukraine, French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said on March 6, according to BFM TV. European leaders are expected to discuss additional support for Ukraine and increased defense spending at an EU summit in Brussels on March 6. President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Brussels for the emergency meeting, which was convened to address Europe&apos;s security strategy amid growing concerns over Washington&apos;s shifting foreign policy.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-working-on-alternatives-to-us-intelligence-defense-minister-says/	2025-03-06T09:14:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1648100666-1.jpg
China's envoy calls Trump's treatment of Europe 'appalling'	China&apos;s special envoy for European affairs, Lu Shaye, criticized U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s treatment of European allies, calling it &quot;appalling,&quot; the South China Morning Post reported on March 6. &quot;When you look at how the Trump administration has implemented a brazen and domineering policy toward Europe, treating its allies in this way, honestly, from a European perspective, it&apos;s quite appalling,&quot; Shaye said. The Chinese diplomat also stressed that the Ukraine peace deal should not be dictated solely by the U.S. and Russia, adding that &quot;various proposed solutions should be subject to equal discussion, rather than being dictated by a select few.&quot; Shaye&apos;s comments follow U.S.-Russia talks held in Istanbul on Feb. 27 and an earlier round in Riyadh on Feb. 18, as Washington seeks a swift settlement to the war. The negotiations, which excluded Kyiv and Europe, have raised concerns that the U.S. is sidelining key allies. Trump&apos;s shift in U.S. foreign policy has drawn scrutiny, as he has echoed Kremlin narratives and accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of prolonging the war. Trump has aligned his policy with the Kremlin&apos;s agenda and has so far refused to offer any security guarantees to Ukraine. Washington has also frozen all military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv in an effort to pressure Zelensky into negotiations with Moscow. Beijing has remained a key ally of Moscow throughout the invasion, deepening economic ties and becoming Russia&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods &#x2014; equipment the military uses in its war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinas-envoy-says-trumps-treatment-of-europe-appalling/	2025-03-06T08:39:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2159810856.jpg
The Czech weapons giant replacing the Kalashnikov in Ukraine’s army	The Russian-made Kalashnikov still prevails as the main small arm in Ukraine&#x2019;s military. A Czech weapons giant is setting up shop in Ukraine&#x2019;s factories to change that. The Prague-domiciled conglomerate, Colt CZ, has set up assembly of its Bren 2 assault rifles inside Ukraine under the name &#x201C;Sich&#x201D; &#x2014; the center of life for Zaporizhzhian Cossacks, a historical group of Ukrainian semi-nomadic warriors. The goal, as Colt CZ&#x2019;s head of public sector, Ondrej Bohac, put it, is to &#x201C;get rid of Ukrainian dependence on Soviet weapons, like the AK-47, and not only on the weapons themselves but also on the ammunition, which is still produced mainly in Russia and Belarus.&#x201D; Ukraine does not seem close to running through its old stockpiles of ammunition, but as with the conversion from Soviet 122 and 152 mm artillery to NATO-standard 120 and 155 mm, the transition is a long-term Western turn. The Sich offers swappable components for alternating between Soviet and NATO calibers. Tens of thousands of the assault rifles are already in the hands of Ukrainian soldiers, mostly from Czechia, but they have begun assembly inside of Ukraine. Many international arms giants have announced plans to build their wares inside of Ukraine, ranging from Rheinmetall to Northrop Grumman to Bayraktar. Colt CZ is one of the first to set up production, putting the firm in a relative frontier position. Its experience will be a bellwether for NATO-based weapons manufacturers expanding to Ukraine. Colt CZ began its life as Jihoceska Zbrojovka, or the South Czech Armory, shortly after the First World War and the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Renamed to Ceska Zbrojovka, or Czech Armory, it would go on to survive Nazi occupation and Soviet domination and ultimately an invasion by Warsaw Pact soldiers in 1968. In large part thanks to Ceska Zbrojovka, Czechoslovakia would retain an unusually independent military until the fall of the USSR. Recent years have seen the company expand internationally, most conspicuously in buying the Connecticut-originated Colt brand, the unofficial armory of the American Wild West whose name now sits alongside &#x201C;CZ&#x201D; in the company&#x2019;s title. Today, Colt CZ can assemble 400 of their Bren 2 Siches per day in Ukrainian factories, according to Bohac. Ukraine&#x2019;s state-owned defense conglomerate, UkrOboronProm, announced the start of production in December. Colt CZ product manufacturing. (Colt CZ)The assembly lines are owned and staffed by UkrOboronProm, which, for the time being, is getting components shipped from Colt CZ&#x2019;s original factories. Colt CZ is, in turn, training the Ukrainian staff and leasing out their assembly method. It&#x2019;s an arrangement that is becoming standard for international arms makers looking to set up inside of Ukraine. Many have made announcements of doing so over the past three years, but projects by firms like Rheinmetall or Northrop Grumman, primarily to produce 155 mm artillery ammunition, have stalled out. Colt CZ is among the biggest to have started production, at least partially because the guns are themselves small arms rather than, say, ballistic missiles. The speed of set-up is also thanks to the geographical and political proximity of Ukraine and Czechia&#x2019;s own experience under the Soviet heel. &#x201C;It shows our commitment to support the industry and actually do things and not only talk about them,&#x201D; said Bohac. It has been a complicated road to &#x201C;the integration of our defense-industrial complex with the industrial chain of NATO nations,&#x201D; UkrOboronProm&#x2019;s general director, Oleh Hulyak, said in December. Ukrainians fear giving over their home turf to foreign business. Foreign companies are wary of Ukrainian law, particularly historically lax local intellectual property, or IP, protections. In their absence, foreign brands are loath to leave their inventions in Ukraine, where they risk being stolen and counterfeited, in some cases by UkrOboronProm itself. Ukrainian courts are famously unreliable, and their sentences for IP violations often stop at trivial fines. When asked whether Colt CZ would ever end up fighting for its IP rights in a Ukrainian courtroom, Bohac responded, &#x201C;Hopefully not &#x2014; like any other global company, we always prefer that it&apos;s resolved in a third-country courtroom.&#x201D; The Ukrainian production is starting with just assembly of components manufactured in Colt CZ&#x2019;s factories in Czechia, protecting the process while the assembly line for Bren 2 Sich rifles expands. UkrOboronProm gets a stake in the sale, and the Ukrainian government gets to buy from the home team. &#x201C;It has opened the door to the Ukrainian market because every country prefers to procure from domestic producers,&#x201D; said Bohac. Colt CZ product manufacturing. (Colt CZ)It has been a process of diplomacy for Bohac, himself a former Czech diplomat. The Colt CZ deal is not the first time the Ukrainian military has tried to move its main rifles on to NATO calibers. In 2017, a much-touted rollout of a copy of the American M4 called the WAC-47, which UkrOboronProm announced would have replaceable parts to take both NATO and Kalashnikov-standard ammunition, came to nothing. Bohac declined to identify exactly how many Siches had been produced locally, citing UkrOboronProm&#x2019;s rules, but said that something in the &#x201C;upper tens of thousands&#x201D; are already in Ukrainian hands and &#x201C;tens of thousands should be assembled (in Ukraine) this year.&#x201D; Colt CZ also envisions more component manufacturing in Ukraine and expansion into other weapons, including their P10 pistols and CZ Scorpion Evo 3. Among Colt CZ&#x2019;s latest acquisitions is Sellier &amp; Bellot, another Czech company that&#x2019;s made ammunition for almost 200 years. Sellier &amp; Bellot makes its own machining tools, which are essential to more localized component manufacturing within Ukraine. The plan, said Bohac, is to expand from assembly to component production using those machines. &#x201C;We will provide the IP, the machinery, training, and they will take care of all those components and materials, including the powder,&#x201D; he said. The company also has its eyes on greater global output. Post-war, Colt CZ is envisioning selling from Ukraine to other former Soviet states looking to replace their old rifles. But with the war still raging and export controls still fully up, the immediate market will be strictly Ukrainian. &#x201C;I mean, it&apos;s a beautiful story that we are making here. It&apos;s historical. We hope it will be remembered after decades that Czechia, with international donors through our company, was one of the key forces behind the rearmament of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,&#x201D; said Bohac.

Families of Ukrainian POWs rally outside US Embassy, demand 'all-for-all' exchange before peace deal	Relatives of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) and missing persons held a peaceful rally outside of the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv on March 6, urging Washington to help secure the release of all Ukrainian soldiers and civilians held in Russian captivity. The protest comes as U.S. President Donald Trump pushes for a swift peace deal with Russia that foresees concessions from Kyiv, but not the aggressor state that invaded Ukraine in 2014 and escalated the war in 2022, killing tens of thousands of civilians. Protesters demanded an &quot;all-for-all&quot; prisoner exchange before any peace deal with Russia is signed, Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne reported. Russia and Ukraine have conducted multiple swaps throughout the full-scale war, most recently on Feb. 5, when Ukraine secured the return of 150 POWs. Kyiv has pushed for an all-for-all prisoner exchange since 2024, but Moscow has refused the proposal. Ukraine does not disclose the exact number of its soldiers held in Russian captivity. According to Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets, Moscow holds over 16,000 Ukrainian civilians. Additionally, Russia has forcibly deported more than 19,500 Ukrainian children to Russia, Belarus, or occupied territories.

(Genya SAVILOV / Getty Images)Earlier on March 5, the day of Trump&apos;s address to Congress, a pro-Ukrainian rally was held in Washington near the Capitol. According to Euronews, the demostrators in Washington protested against Trump&apos;s recent statements on Ukraine and his decision to suspend military aid to Kyiv. The protests come amid escalating tensions between Washington and Kyiv following the contentious Feb. 28 Oval Office meeting between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. The talks, originally intended to finalize a U.S.-Ukraine mineral deal, ended in a public dispute, leading to the cancellation of the agreement. Since then, &#xA0;Trump has cut U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv, while some U.S. officials and Republican lawmakers have intensified criticism of Zelensky, with some suggesting he should resign.	https://kyivindependent.com/families-of-ukrainian-pows-rally-outside-us-embassy-demand-all-for-all-exchange-before-peace-deal/	2025-03-06T07:36:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202969930.jpg
Ukraine's central bank raises key policy rate to 15.5%, warns about foreign policy risks	Ukraine&apos;s National Bank (NBU) will raise the key policy rate from 14.5% to 15.5% per annum starting from March 7, chairman Andrii Pyshnyi said on March 6. The move marks the second raise of the key policy rate since the beginning of 2025. In late January, the central bank raised it from 13.5% to 14.5%. The Ukrainian economy was heavily hit by Russia&apos;s full-scale war. At the start of the invasion, inflation skyrocketed to 26.6% in 2022 from 10.0% in 2021. It subsided the following year, but in 2024, inflation again accelerated to 12%, exceeding NBU&apos;s forecast. According to Pyshnyi, the decision aims to maintain the &quot;attractiveness of savings&quot; in the hryvnia currency, the stability of the foreign exchange market, and keeping expectations under control, which will bring inflation to the 5% target. &quot;The NBU will be ready to take additional measures in case of further risks to price dynamics and inflation expectations,&quot; Pyshnyi said. The NBU raised its key policy rate to 10% in January 2022. It had remained unchanged since the beginning of the all-out war, but on June 3, 2022, the rate grew from 10% to 25%. For over a year, it remained at the same level, dropping to 22% in July 2023 and following a gradual decline. In December 2024, the NBU raised the key policy rate from 13% to 13.5% in response to inflationary developments. The central bank said that the risks &quot;of less favorable foreign economic trends&quot; have increased due to &quot;further geopolitical polarization of countries&quot; and &quot;the corresponding fragmentation of global trade.&quot; The comments come amid seismic geopolitical shifts as the U.S. under President Donald Trump has adopted an increasingly hostile stance toward Ukraine, threatened to impose tariffs against other partners, and floated the idea of deepening an economic partnership with Russia. Although the risks to the sufficiency of international financing remain &quot;balanced,&quot; the amount of external support confirmed for 2025 should be &quot;sufficient&quot; to finance the budget deficit without issuing new debt and &quot;to maintain an adequate level of international reserves,&quot; the statement read. &quot;This will allow the NBU to continue to ensure a stable situation in the foreign exchange market and controllability of inflation and exchange rate expectations,&quot; the central bank said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-central-bank-raises-key-policy-rate-warns-about/	2025-03-06T06:00:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2158010341.jpg
European air forces could protect Ukraine from Russian aerial strikes, experts suggest	Military experts proposed to deploy European air forces to protect Kyiv and other non-front-line Ukrainian cities from Russian aerial attacks, the Guardian reported on March 6, citing the so-called Sky Shield plan. The plan could potentially work as part of the &quot;truce in the sky&quot; proposed by President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier this week, preventing missiles, long-range drones, and bombs from targeting civilian infrastructure. The project&apos;s supporters said it could be a European-led air defense zone involving 120 fighter jets that will operate separately from NATO. According to the plan, developed by former British Air Force planners in cooperation with Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, the protection zone would cover Ukraine&apos;s three operational nuclear power plants, as well as the cities of Odesa and Lviv in Ukraine&apos;s south and west. The country&apos;s east, where the fierce battles are ongoing in Donetsk Oblast, were not included in the zone. According to the authors, this step can be more tangible than the deployment of ground troops as peacekeepers. In February, the Washington Post reported that up to 30,000 European troops could be deployed in the country after a potential ceasefire. Among those who supported the Sky Shield plan are Philip Breedlove, former NATO supreme commander in Europe, Polish ex-President Aleksander Kwasniewski, and Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania&apos;s former foreign minister. European defense ministries have considered the plan, but their leaders have been reluctant to authorize patrolling Ukrainian skies while Russia&apos;s full-scale war is ongoing, the Guardian wrote. In light of the U.S. policy shift and suspension of military aid to Ukraine, the initiative can be revisited, the news outlet noted. Yet, Western partners still fear an escalation if an aircraft from either side is attacked or shot down. Russian forces regularly launch drones and missiles against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, inflicting heavy civilian casualties. A Russian missile strike against a hotel in Kryvyi Rih late on March 5, carried out shortly after the U.S. paused vital intelligence sharing, killed four people and injured over 30. According to figures released by Kyiv, U.N. statistics, and open-source data published by BBC Russia, the total death toll of Ukrainian and Russian soldiers, as well as Ukrainian civilians, stood at over 148,000 as of mid-February.	https://kyivindependent.com/sky-shield-plan/	2025-03-06T05:43:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2169510520.jpg
Poland, Lithuania signal openness to French nuclear deterrence for Europe	Polish and Lithuanian leaders spoke in positive terms on March 6 about French President Emmanuel Macron&apos;s suggestion that Paris could extend its nuclear umbrella to protect European allies. Macron proposed to start &quot;strategic discussions&quot; on the subject as he warned Europe against the Russian threat and stressed that European countries should no longer rely on the U.S. for their security. France is the only EU country with nuclear weapons. &quot;This readiness of France, this is something very promising,&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk told reporters in Brussels on the sidelines of an EU summit. &quot;We have to treat this proposal seriously.&quot; Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda called it a &quot;very interesting idea,&quot; adding that a nuclear umbrella would serve as an effective deterrence against potential Russian aggression. Both Poland and Lithuania lie at NATO&apos;s eastern flank and share a border with Moscow&apos;s ally Belarus and the heavily armed exclave of Kaliningrad, putting them on the front line of a potential NATO-Russia clash. The idea of nuclear sharing with France was also previously floated by Friedrich Merz, who is likely to be Germany&apos;s next chancellor after victory in the February elections. The discussion comes amid mounting uncertainty of the U.S.&apos;s commitment to European security under President Donald Trump. The Trump administration has frozen military aid for Ukraine and signaled that its geopolitical focus will no longer be on the European continent. Washington also seeks to renew its relationship with Moscow, supposedly in an effort to drive it away from China. European leaders are gathering in Brussels to discuss the EU&apos;s need to boost defense spending and support for Ukraine. This involves the European Commission&apos;s ReArm Europe plan that could mobilize up to 800 billion euros ($860 billion) to arm Europe and Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-lithuania-open-to-potential-french-nuclear-deterrence-for-europe/	2025-03-06T05:25:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-2202961314.jpg
Trump admin to revoke legal status of 240,000 Ukrainian refugees, Reuters reports	The Trump administration is preparing to revoke the temporary legal status of 240,000 Ukrainians who fled to the U.S. from Russia&apos;s invasion, potentially paving the way for their deportation, Reuters reported on March 6, citing four undisclosed sources. The plan predates U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s public spat with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28 and is part of broader efforts to revoke the legal status of more than 1.8 million people staying in the U.S. on humanitarian grounds, the news agency noted. The move, which is expected as soon as April, would nevertheless threaten to further widen the rift between Kyiv and Washington after the U.S. paused military assistance and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. U.S. and Ukrainian officials have not confirmed the claims. Around 5.2 million Ukrainian refugees remain abroad, with the vast majority of them receiving protection in EU countries. Migrants stripped of the humanitarian parole, granted as part of the Biden administration&apos;s programs, could be fast-tracked for deportations, Reuters reported, citing an internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) document. Immigration has been one of the key topics of Trump&apos;s electoral campaign as he pledged to bolster border security and tighten immigration rules. His first days in office were followed by announcements of large-scale deportations of undocumented migrants, though data suggests the rate is comparable to Biden&apos;s years. The Trump administration began rolling back the protection of Ukrainian and other refugees mere days after taking office. The Uniting for Ukraine program, which allowed Ukrainians to stay in the U.S. for up to two years, work, and receive health insurance, was suspended by late January.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-admin-to-revoke-legal-status-of-240-000-ukrainian-refugees-reuters-reports/	2025-03-06T04:41:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/03/GettyImages-1246719706.jpg
