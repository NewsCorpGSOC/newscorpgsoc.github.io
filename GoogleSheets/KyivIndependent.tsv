US targets China-Russia sanctions evasion scheme with new measures	The U.S. Treasury Department has targeted actors involved in a sanctions evasion scheme facilitating cross-border payments for sensitive goods between China and Russia as part of a new package of sanctions, according to a Jan. 15 announcement. The U.S. Treasury imposed new sanctions on a total of over 150 entities and individuals, including companies in Russia&#x2019;s defense industry and those supporting it, as well as dozens of entities across multiple countries that help Russia evade U.S. sanctions. The Treasury also expanded measures against almost 100 entities already under sanctions for their cooperation with Russia&#x2019;s military-industrial complex. &quot;Today&apos;s actions frustrate the Kremlin&apos;s ability to circumvent our sanctions and get access to the goods they need to build weapons for their war of choice in Ukraine,&quot; said Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Wally Adeyemo. Moscow and Beijing set up regional clearing platforms (RCPs) in both Russia and China to act as counterparties for cross-border payments for sensitive goods. This allows for non-cash mutual payments for sanctioned goods, according to the Treasury. The Russian-Chinese scheme involves Russian financial institutions on the U.S. sanctions list, such as Public Joint Stock Company Sberbank of Russia, Joint Stock Company Alfa-Bank, Open Joint Stock Company Sovcombank, T-Bank, and Limited Liability Company Bank Tochka. The sanctions also target OJSC Keremet Bank, based in Kyrgyzstan, which has been coordinating with Russian officials and Promsvyazbank, a Russian bank under U.S. sanctions, to evade sanctions since the summer of 2024. In 2024, the Kyrgyz Finance Ministry sold a controlling stake in Keremet Bank to a firm closely linked to Russian-Moldovan oligarch Ilan Shor, who has ties to the Russian government. The purchase of Keremet Bank was intended to create a hub for circumventing sanctions through which Russia could pay for imports and receive payments for exports, according to the statement. The new sanctions also target 20 Russian energy companies and over 30 organizations and institutions from the defense and related sectors. Earlier on Jan. 10, the U.S. and U.K. imposed broad sanctions against the Russian oil industry, taking aim at Moscow&apos;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet.&quot; The restrictions targeted nearly 200 vessels, along with Russian oil companies and industry officials. President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the sanctions as a &quot;significant blow to the financial foundation of Russia&apos;s war machine.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-targets-china-russia-sanctions-evasion-scheme-with-new-measures/	2025-01-15T11:16:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1781860144.jpg
Will Europe put ‘boots on the ground’ for peace in Ukraine? We asked top Nordic, Baltic officials	Just days out from the return of Donald Trump to the White House, the future of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine is dominated by a great unknown: whether the incoming president will manage to push Moscow to stop its advance on the battlefield, or whether he will disengage and perhaps abandon U.S. support for Ukraine entirely. Either way, one thing is clear: the war cannot come to an end with a secure Ukraine without Europe playing a braver role. The chance of the guns and drones going silent across Ukraine in 24 hours after Trump takes office &#x2014; as Trump had frequently promised on the campaign trail &#x2014; is slim to none. Nonetheless, amid consistent rhetoric from Washington that Europe must up defense spending and take more responsibility for their continent&#x2019;s security, European countries are faced with an urgent task: taking the braver steps to secure Ukraine against a bullish Moscow seemingly more convinced in its forthcoming victory than at any time since February 2022. In a new reality far removed from the war of 2022, the catch phrase going into 2025 is now &#x201C;boots on the ground.&#x201D; The first serious floating of the idea of European troops entering Ukrainian territory came from French President Emmanuel Macron in the spring of 2024. &#x201C;In fact, many countries said that in the weeks that followed that they understood our approach, that they agreed with our position and that this position was a good thing.&#x201D; French soldiers with the 1st Infantry Regiment fire mortars near Rena, Norway, during Exercise Brilliant Jump 2022, on March 17, 2022.

(Photo by Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP via Getty Images)Media coverage of hypothetical European &#x201C;boots on the ground&#x201D; is often presented in the context of a peacekeeping force entering Ukrainian territory after a hypothetical peace deal. While clear that larger players like France, Poland, or the U.K. would need to be involved, and that it is hard to imagine a new level of European action without the backing of the incoming U.S. administration, the role of smaller countries in the Nordic and Baltic states also looks to be critical. Consistently among the top providers of military aid to Kyiv as a percentage of GDP, countries like Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have also been the most outspoken in their support for Ukrainian victory, beyond the tired repetitions of &#x201C;as long as it takes.&#x201D; Recent alleged Russian sabotage attacks in the Baltic Sea, including the damaging of undersea cables running between Nordic and Baltic states, have served as a reminder that Russia&#x2019;s war is not limited to Ukrainian territory. The Kyiv Independent spoke to top officials, experts, and other stakeholders in some of Ukraine&#x2019;s top European partners to take the pulse of countries that could be part of a new &#x201C;coalition of the willing&#x201D; in their support of Ukraine in 2025. Before facing up to Trump, let alone Putin, the first major hurdle European countries must overcome is their own mindset, according to Jukka Kopra, chair of the Finnish parliament&#x2019;s defense committee. &#x201C;Finland has always taken defense seriously. So we have a conscription system. We have a large reserve-based army,&#x201D; Kopra said to the Kyiv Independent in Helsinki. &#x201C;Nobody&apos;s ever ready for war, but we have things in order. We take it seriously, unlike some other countries who only have things working on paper.&#x201D; Although relatively small in terms of hard geopolitical sway, since the launch of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, the countries immediately bordering Russia have often found themselves in the role of activist, pushing Ukraine&#x2019;s crystal-clear message that peace must come through strength in the NATO arena. &#x201C;One might think that when the escalated aggression started in February 2022, everybody&apos;s eyes would open,&#x201D; said Kopra. &#x201C;They are opening slowly, but not everywhere.&#x201D; Of all NATO member states, none show more clarity than the Baltic States, where the memory of Soviet occupation and the totalitarian repression that came with it remains fresh. Only recently stepping down after his country&#x2019;s last elections, former Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrelius Landsbergis has been one the most eloquent pro-Ukrainian voices among foreign officials. Lithuania&apos;s former Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis at Munich Security Conference 2024 in Munich, Germany on Feb. 18, 2024. (Olena Zashko / The Kyiv Independent)&#x201C;Appeasement is a recurring virus; the seasons vary in how often it does reoccur in Europe, but it always comes back,&#x201D; said Landsbergis to the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;The logic is always the same. I am the person who can appease, who can offer part of some other country to a dictator and all of us will be fine. It&apos;s so iconic when you see Chamberlain resurrected in 2024 in Europe and picking up the phone and saying, &#x2018;I have this.&#x2019;&#x201D; Landsbergis wasn&#x2019;t the only Baltic minister to mention the infamous British prime minister, who had signed the Munich Agreement with Nazi Germany less than a year before Adolf Hitler invaded Poland. &#x201C;If it is a Chamberlain peace, it will be the start of more and more aggression,&#x201D; said Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsakhna to the Kyiv Independent in Tallinn. &#x201C;Now, we have every opportunity to avoid everything that came after 1938: World War II. This is not only about Europe, it is about the world order.&#x201D; As clear as the rhetoric of the Nordics and Baltics has been, taking braver steps still requires the leadership of countries with more weight to throw around. &#x201C;These conversations have matured,&#x201D; said French security expert Leonie Allard to the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;But you need much more political weight from other Europeans, which we haven&apos;t seen so much.&#x201D; Germany, traditionally cautious but still the second-largest provider of military aid to Ukraine, looks to be completely absorbed by upcoming federal elections in February, while France&#x2019;s government collapsed in December. These countries that have traditionally been the leaders of Europe, they are kind of incapable at the moment,&#x201D; said Kopra, &#x201C;and what a coincidence it is, what a good position for the Kremlin.&#x201D; Still, the clear choice to take the lead is Paris, said Allard, who co-authored a recent paper published by the Atlantic Council entitled &#x201C;Europe needs a coalition of the resolute.&#x201D; Macron brings with him to the table personal experience dealing with both Putin and Trump, which could be crucial in coordinating a braver European bloc. &#x201C;France cannot do anything on its own, nothing at all,&#x201D; said Allard, &#x201C;it&apos;s also up to other Europeans to, you know, take this opportunity to put forward their own ideas on what they want to do.&#x201D; The other obvious candidate to strengthen such a coalition would be Poland, the nation with the most to lose in national security from an abandonment of neighboring Ukraine.

(Chesnot / Getty Images)Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has denied reports claiming he discussed deploying troops to Ukraine with Macron, as Warsaw sticks closely to a doctrine of beefing up its military to defend NATO borders. Still, the possibility of Poland changing its tune shouldn&#x2019;t be ruled out, said Allard. &#x201C;What other war is NATO preparing for apart from one with Russia?&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;There&apos;s only one thing, and if that thing means being in Ukraine, then it should be being in Ukraine. There is no other scenario.&#x201D; &#x201C;Whatever the solution is to the present situation in the war between Ukraine and Russia,&#x201D; said Kopra, &#x201C;in any case, we are back in the Cold War, and all of Europe should start accelerating accordingly.&#x201D; Since the launch of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Kyiv has stressed that Ukraine doesn&#x2019;t need foreign militaries to join the fight: the West only needs to provide the weaponry and ammunition, and Ukraine will do the job. When it comes to direct combat with Russian forces, this position hasn&#x2019;t changed, but with a dangerous and unpredictable outlook for the war in 2025, other versions of &#x201C;boots on the ground&#x201D; are being explored to improve Ukraine&#x2019;s position. A starting point often discussed is training. If conducted far from the front line, moving the existing overseas training programs into Ukrainian territory would not only make them more efficient, but send a strong signal to Moscow that the West will not just retreat to NATO&#x2019;s eastern flank. Speaking to the Kyiv Independent in Stockholm, Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson pointed out that representatives of his country&#x2019;s defense procurement agency were already on the ground in Ukraine, and that Sweden wouldn&#x2019;t rule out training Ukrainian troops on Ukrainian territory. Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson at the Munich Security Conference in Berlin, Germany on Feb. 16, 2024. (Olena Zashko / The Kyiv Independent)&#x201C;We think it&apos;s good if we can find unity on this, there are ongoing discussions in several different places in Europe,&#x201D; he said. According to Landsbergis, a move for European countries to begin training Ukrainian soldiers inside Ukraine could be the first step in a series of careful moves that will slowly but surely up the deterrence factor for Moscow. &#x201C;If they&apos;re trained in Ukraine, imagine that where troops are trained, the areas are defended with additional air defense support. You bring Lithuanian and French troops, the French bring in the air defense, and we start covering parts of Ukrainian territory.&#x201D; Nonetheless, for now, the majority of attention has been on the use of European troops as a physical security guarantee, as expressed by Zelensky after his calls with Macron. After a tough two years of attritional warfare which saw a failed Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023 and a steadily worsening manpower crisis, the fading perspective of a complete Ukrainian victory has turned attention to the need for peace to come with hard guarantees against a repeat Russian invasion.

(Kevin Dietsch / Getty Images)Trump and his team, many of whom publicly subscribe to the myth that &#x201C;NATO expansion&#x201D; was one of the main causes of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, have spoken strongly against inviting Kyiv to the alliance, an offer that sat at the top of Zelensky&#x2019;s victory plan as presented to partners in October. &#x201C;What are these security guarantees in real life? Are they peacekeeping missions, military missions? Our point is very clear: NATO membership for Ukraine is the most secure, most clear, most efficient, and cheapest way to give real security guarantees. Any other structure is much more complicated.&#x201D; &#x201C;There are four countries that gave security guarantees for Ukraine (in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum). One of them attacked Ukraine &#x2015; Russia &#x2015; and the three others are not fulfilling that agreement.&#x201D; &#x201C;Currently, NATO is not ready to enter the war,&#x201D; said Braze, &#x201C;because the clear concept is that Ukraine&apos;s self-defense is supported, everybody provides what is necessary, but nobody wants to be part of the war, fighting the war.&#x201D; Though not as physically threatened by Russia as the Nordics or Baltics, France&#x2019;s leading role in a future troop deployment makes a lot of sense due to the organization of its military and recent experience, said Allard. &#x201C;France is the country that has an army structure that&apos;s based a lot on expeditionary forces, used to send forces abroad,&#x201D; she said, pointing to a wealth of recent French experience operating in the Sahel region in Africa.

(Alain Jocard / AFP via Getty Images)Once the time comes for deployment, it is very unlikely that European troops could be stationed along the contact line itself, as sometimes broached in visions of a so-called &#x201C;demilitarized zone.&#x201D; What is more realistic, said Allard, is the deployment of European forces in bases further back, with the explicit purpose of acting as a so-called &#x201C;tripwire force,&#x201D; with the explicit purpose of making any further Russian aggression in Ukraine immediately come at the cost of direct conflict with NATO. &#x201C;The size and the ability of this tripwire force to weigh on Ukraine security would be dependent on the level of lethality that we find ourselves in, in a situation of a deal.&#x201D; Ultimately, in the absence of NATO membership for Ukraine, &#x201C;boots on the ground&#x201D; might just be the kind of ad-hoc measure that is enough to deter an aging, weakened Putin from launching a repeat invasion. &#x201C;It changes Putin&apos;s calculations,&#x201D; said Landsbergis of the tripwire effect, &#x201C;because as President Macron clearly said, Putin will have to keep in mind that if you enter Odesa, you will find French troops.&#x201D; As much as real discussions might be ongoing among a potential future European &#x201C;coalition of the willing,&#x201D; even the most basic public specifics are still lacking. The reason for indecisiveness and delay is one person, Trump, but even more so, said Allard, is the looming anticipation of the results of his first steps for ending the war. &#x201C;We&apos;re waiting for the U.S. to put forward the terms of the potential negotiations,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;since it&apos;s their view &#x2014; that of the Trump team &#x2014; and try to help Ukraine to also be able to shape that. But if this goes forward, Europeans are ready to take on more responsibility.&#x201D; With Russia publicly rejecting early attempts at drawing up a tentative peace deal, Trump&#x2019;s incoming envoy for peace in Ukraine, retired General Keith Kellogg, has named 100 days as his personal target to reach a deal.

(Sean Gallup / Getty Images)&#x201C;The coin is still in the air, right? We don&apos;t know which side it will land on,&#x201D; said Landsbergis of Trump&#x2019;s approach to Putin upon inauguration. &#x201C;I think it&apos;s rather black and white, right? It&apos;s impossible that it lands on a situation which would be comfortable for both, for Ukrainians and Russians. That means that if you give something to Putin, that will be his victory and Ukrainian loss.&#x201D; In the meantime though, argues Allard, the last thing Europe should do is sit idle. If wants to weigh on Putin&apos;s decision to enter negotiations, Europe should try to move forward with a developed public position on troops in Ukraine now, she said. &#x201C;It&apos;s now that we, Europeans, should prepare and form this notion and not after a negotiation.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/will-europe-put-boots-on-the-ground-for-peace-in-ukraine-we-asked-top-nordic-baltic-officials/	2025-01-15T10:14:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2154604513.jpg
Ukrainian soldiers on capturing North Korean POW	After numerous attempts, Ukrainian forces operating in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast have finally captured two North Korean soldiers. President Volodymyr Zelensky called this &#x201C;irrefutable evidence&#x201D; of Pyongyang&#x2019;s involvement in the Kremlin&#x2019;s full-scale war against Ukraine. One of the two soldiers was taken prisoner by Ukraine&#x2019;s Special Operations Forces. Watch this video to find out why capturing North Korean soldiers is so challenging &#x2014; and how Ukrainian forces ultimately succeeded.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-soldiers-on-capturing-north-korean-pow/	2025-01-15T09:48:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/3_1.jpg
Ukraine’s military now totals 880,000 soldiers, facing 600,000 Russian troops, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 15 that Ukraine&apos;s military now comprises 880,000 soldiers, tasked with defending the entire country against 600,000 Russian troops concentrated in specific areas. Speaking at a joint press conference with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk in Warsaw, Zelensky said that Russia&apos;s localized troop concentration creates a numerical advantage. &quot;Russian troops are concentrated in several areas, so in some areas, they have a quantitative advantage,&quot; he said. Ukraine has been struggling with a manpower shortage, especially in the infantry, while Russia has intensified its offensive in Donetsk Oblast since the summer of 2024. Earlier on Jan. 14, a scandal erupted in Ukraine as Air Force members claimed they were being transferred to bolster the infantry. According to Ukrainska Pravda, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi issued an order on Jan. 11 to transfer over 5,000 Air Force personnel to Ground Forces units. A senior Air Force officer, speaking anonymously, said transfers began in spring 2024 and have now reached a &quot;critical level,&quot; with unit staffing dropping to 50%. The General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces denied claims of transferring technical and aviation personnel, saying that these resources are being increased. Critics have called for deeper mobilization reforms, as Ukraine&#x2019;s army faces challenges related to demographics and an uneven mobilization process. In 2024, Ukraine lowered its minimum mobilization age from 27 to 25 but resisted calls from international partners to reduce it further to 18. Zelensky also reported progress in arms production, saying that Ukraine now covers 33-34% of its annual weapons needs &#x2014; up from less than 10% before the full-scale invasion. Europe and the U.S. supply more than 60% of Ukraine&#x2019;s weaponry, with each accounting for about 30%.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-military-now-totals-880-000-soldiers-facing-600-000-russian-troops-zelensky-says/	2025-01-15T09:11:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187689001.jpg
Why Ukraine’s long-delayed missile production ambitions have yet to get off the ground	The Ukrainian government in recent months has been aggressively touting fresh developments in its missile-making. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the country had built 100 of its own missiles in 2024 as of November. He called for 3,000 &#x201C;cruise missiles or missile-drones&#x201D; to be manufactured in 2025. Traditional missiles are tricky. Ukraine&#x2019;s notable successes in scaling up drone production were to a large degree a workaround of the country&#x2019;s limits in defense industry autonomy. Russia and the West gutted Ukraine&#x2019;s weapons factories after the fall of the USSR, with the help of local corruption. Those that remain are subject to constant Russian bombardment. As a result, analysts call Zelensky&#x2019;s figures and the claimed features of traditional missiles made at home an oversell. &#x201C;If Ukraine can only deliver half of what Zelensky promised at the end of 2024 in terms of missile and drone production, I will be very content. But that&apos;s going to be challenging,&#x201D; says Fabian Hoffmann, a missile expert and research fellow at the Oslo Nuclear Project. Ukraine&#x2019;s budding missile program joins a long tradition of metaphorical and literal saber-rattling between hostile armies. For the time being, the missiles have yet to prove themselves on the battlefield. The challenge for outside observers is in sorting out ballistics from bluster. Here is what we know and can assess of the roster of Ukraine&#x2019;s home-grown missiles today. Originally designed to hit ships from coastal positions, the Neptune has been converted into a cruise missile that can be launched from land, per Ukrainian authorities. It is what Hoffmann calls &#x201C;by far the most mature of these large missile projects.&#x201D; Ukrainian officials said it was a Neptune that struck and sank the Russian cruiser Moskva back in April 2022. An unnamed official told the War Zone that they had reconfigured the Neptune to strike and disable an S-400 Russian air defense battery back in August 2023. Various Ukrainian Telegram channels cited anonymous sources saying that the Neptune was used to hit a Russian ammunition depot in Rostov Oblast on Jan. 11. But evidence of Neptunes flying is largely limited to government statements or citations of unnamed officials. That is despite Zelensky touting that the Neptune had been &#x201C;accepted into weaponry&#x201D; in a speech to Ukraine&#x2019;s Parliament all the way back in 2020. &#x201C;There were discussions that Ukraine would set up production for at least the anti-ship cruise missiles,&#x201D; says Hoffmann. &#x201C;Initially we heard that they were very artisanaly producing them &#x2014; just a couple per month at most, but there was not really a production line. But there was this assumption that Ukraine would be able to streamline that to some extent. And that obviously hasn&apos;t happened, at least if we derive it from the rate of usage which really hasn&apos;t seen any kind of uptick since 2023.&#x201D; Distinct from the cruise missile Neptune, the Hrim 2 &#x2014; or Thunder 2 in English &#x2014; is a ballistic rocket program, based on solid fuel and inertial guidance and in theory reaching speeds several times that of sound. Unlike a cruise missile, a ballistic missile goes far into the atmosphere, with many traveling at speeds many times that of sound. The program goes back as far as 2006 under the name Sapsan, which at some point became the internal name, as opposed to the envisioned international export model, the Hrim 2. Ukrainian officials said that the Hrim 2 finally passed testing toward the end of 2024, with Zelensky announcing &#x201C;positive results&#x201D; in August. The head of the permanent Ukrainian delegation to NATO, Yehor Cherniev, said of the Hrim 2s in October: &#x201C;Here, believe me, there will soon be concrete results that not only Ukraine, but the Russian Federation will see.&#x201D; &#x201C;I&#x2019;m seeing test launch claims from last year but, eh,&#x201D; says Michael Duitsman, a missile specialist at the Middlebury Institute in California, doubtfully, about the Hrim 2. Two projects, the Korshun and Vilcha &#x2014; respectively a cruise missile and multiple-launch rocket system &#x2014; were the subject of extensive press speculation in the mid- to late-2010s. The Korshun was a cruise missile, a scale model of which was getting dragged around weapons conferences a decade ago. Despite being a cruise missile, one pro-Russian Telegram channel in 2017 named it as the basis for the Hrim 2. The Korshun project has effectively been shelved since Zelensky&#x2019;s election. The Vilcha is an updated Soviet rocket complex that promised to use modernized, Ukrainian-made rockets with higher precision than its predecessor. Despite appearing in Ukrainian military parades as far back as 2018, there&#x2019;s been no evidence of a functional system playing a role since the full-scale invasion. Ukraine-made Trembita cruise missile. (mil.in.ua)In the same speech in which he promised &#x201C;concrete results&#x201D; for the Hrim 2, Cherniev noted certain components of the Vilcha that &#x201C;unfortunately, we won&#x2019;t be able to get quickly,&#x201D; without specifying what those components were. Various other projects like the volunteer-based &#x201C;Trembita&#x201D; are described as &#x201C;cruise missiles,&#x201D; including in reports from the Economist and the Telegraph, but have nowhere near the speed, range, or payload to merit that title as it is generally understood, maxing out at 400 kilometers/hour, 200 kilometers, and 20 kilograms in each field, respectively.. &#x201C;If you throw a rock fast enough you can call it a missile,&#x201D; says James Acuna, a former naval architect and CIA officer in Eastern Europe, currently consulting on drone production from Estonia, about the Trembita. The main distinction between making classic cruise or ballistic missiles and, for example, Ukraine&#x2019;s &#x201C;missile-drones,&#x201D; which the Trembita more closely resembles, is that the lighter and slower missile-drones can be made in smaller facilities with a far larger proportion of off-the-shelf commercial components. The production of those more advanced engines, guidance systems, and fuel for more traditional missiles requires bigger permanent facilities and massively more precise engineering. &#x201C;This is like another level of science and engineering and physics,&#x201D; says Acuna. &#x201C;Ukraine does not currently have the military-industrial complex to make missiles. Can they make a good Frankenstein missile? Sure, they can do that, but is it going to take down a Kh-31?&#x201D; Designed during the USSR, the Kh-31 is an air-launched missile that hits Mach 3.5 and still sees regular use in the Russian military. Duitsman for one doesn&#x2019;t think the problem is Ukrainian technological savvy so much as Russian air attacks. &#x201C;Once you get the basic industry down it&#x2019;s not that hard, it just becomes immensely harder when someone is trying to bomb all of your factories.&#x201D; Unlike the small workshops in which Ukrainians can produce drones, the factories involved in missile production are massive and their locations well-known. Many Russians still alive once worked in them during the Soviet Union. For the duration of the war, Russian airstrikes have targeted them avidly. In the first months of the war, Russia blew up a massive stockpile of solid rocket fuel in a chemical plant in Pavlohrad, on the western edge of the Donbas. Following a Dec. 20 attack on Kyiv, the Russian Defense Ministry said it had hit &#x201C;the construction bureau &#x2018;Luch,&#x2019; which has accomplished planning and production of rocket complex &#x2018;Neptune&#x2019; and the land-based guided rocket complex &#x2018;Vilcha.&#x2019;&#x201D; Aircraft engines are displayed at the Motor Sich Aviation Museum in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, on July 1, 2022. (Julia Kochetova / Bloomberg via Getty Images)And on Jan. 8, Russia bombarded the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia with glide bombs, resulting in the death of some 13 people and 113 more injured. Among the targeted areas, photos from the national police show damage to a &#x201C;Motor Sich&#x201D; factory that has long produced jet engines, including the MS400 Turbofan engines that at least at some point powered the Neptune. Given such security threats it is not surprising that Ukraine has been secretive in details about its missile program. When reached, a representative for the Strategic Industries Ministry declined to comment, calling it &#x201C;a sensitive subject.&#x201D; Still, little has been seen of these missiles in action, casting great doubt on Ukraine&#x2019;s actual production. Mass use within Russia would almost certainly have ended up on social media via Russians under bombardment. Despite the secrecy, Ukraine is obviously eager to tout successes in these missile programs. The development of a local missile program would allow Ukraine to strike back at Russia directly, freed from Western terms for donated weaponry. Missiles have also become more intangible symbols of independence. Eastern Ukraine was the heartland for much of the Soviet Union&#x2019;s heavy industry. Yuzhnomash in Dnipro was the &#x201C;largest ICBM factory in the world,&#x201D; notes Duitsman. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Ukraine&#x2019;s missile production was dismantled and cannibalized. The government has spent 20 years claiming that a rocket renaissance is at hand. Renamed to Pivdenmash &#x2014; a shift from the Russian to Ukrainian word &#x201C;pivden&#x201D; meaning &#x201C;south&#x201D; &#x2014; the same factory remains an epicenter of Ukraine&#x2019;s weapons production, including the Hrim itself. As with many such plants, Pivdenmash is a target for Russian missile attacks, including the infamous strike by Russia&#x2019;s new Oreshnik on Nov. 21, an event that had many Western observers wringing their hands over the world&#x2019;s first launch of an ICBM. Ukraine is hardly alone in treating missiles as fonts of national pride. U.S. military sources were positively gleeful in touting the Patriot air defense missile&#x2019;s success in shooting down Russia&#x2019;s hypersonic Kinzhal in May 2023. Russia has often bragged about weapons developments beyond their utility. The Russian Oreshnik that struck Pivdenmash in November, for example, was far less impressive than the headlines it managed to gather, says Duitsman. The Oreshnik, he argues, was a fairly minor adaptation of a prior missile that was touted as novel based on the maker&#x2019;s advertising and President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s sudden desire to cause a stir after the U.S. and U.K. permitted Ukraine to strike some Russian territory. &#x201C;States are not monoliths. Russia does not as a whole choose to pursue different missile programs,&#x201D; says Duitsman. &#x201C;These are the results of conflicting political, military, industrial, and engineering goals. The Oreshnik does not necessarily make sense in a military context. It does make sense in the context of these missile design bureaus and missile production factories wanting a piece of the sweet sweet war money pie.&#x201D; Ukraine seems likewise to be overselling the tangible results of local missile development, Hoffmann says. &#x201C;They have a vested interest in making it look like they&apos;re doing well,&#x201D; as Duitsman puts it.	https://kyivindependent.com/why-ukraines-long-delayed-missile-production-ambitions-have-yet-to-get-off-the-ground/	2025-01-15T08:43:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/2022-04-2560px-neptune-cruise-missile-05-1024x689.jpg
NATO defense budget could surpass Russia’s tenfold if Europe matches Poland’s spending, Tusk says	Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk advocated for increased defense spending across NATO on Jan. 15, arguing that if all European members matched Poland&#x2019;s spending, NATO&#x2019;s defense budget would be ten times that of Russia&#x2019;s. &quot;No one but Europe will solve its defense problems,&quot; he said during a joint press conference with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Warsaw. Tusk&#x2019;s comment comes amid growing calls for higher defense spending across NATO, a topic reignited by Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and advocated for by incoming U.S. President Donald Trump. &quot;Other countries should not pay 1.5 percent of their GDP for defense &#x2014; this is not enough,&quot; he said, emphasizing that robust European defense contributions could help maintain friendly U.S.-European relations. On Jan. 7, Trump called for NATO&#x2019;s spending target to rise to 5% of GDP, significantly higher than the current 2% goal. &quot;If all European countries start taking their obligations in NATO seriously, I am sure America will be happy to cooperate with us,&quot; Tusk added. While the 5% suggestion has faced resistance, some NATO members are reportedly open to a more modest increase, potentially to 3% of GDP, Reuters reported on Jan. 10. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte quipped on Jan. 13 that allies should increase spending or prepare to &quot;take Russian language courses or move to New Zealand.&quot; Currently, 24 out of 32 NATO countries meet the 2% GDP target, but several, including Italy, Canada, and Spain, fall short. Zelensky praised his discussions with Tusk, highlighting their focus on bolstering Ukraine&#x2019;s defense capabilities and advancing sanctions against Russia. &quot;We discussed our defense, including the supply of weapons, weapons production, and related investments. We also focused on strengthening sanctions against Russia and bringing peace closer for Ukraine and all of Europe,&quot; Zelensky said on X.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-defense-budget-could-surpass-russias-tenfold-if-europe-matches-polands-spending-pm-says/	2025-01-15T08:42:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GhVq_yOXcAAXWBM.jpeg
‘Absolutely unacceptable’ — Appointment of Ukrainian judge who visited occupied Crimea, Russia triggers criticism	The appointment of a Ukrainian judge who visited Russia and occupied Crimea during Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine has sparked criticism from the head of the country&#x2019;s main judicial watchdog. The High Council of Justice, Ukraine&apos;s top judicial governing body, appointed Oleksandra Shulika as a judge of Kirovohrad Oblast&apos;s Onufriivka District Court on Jan. 14. The decision highlights the continued presence of officials with ties to Russia in the Ukrainian government. While some officials with Russian passports and other links to Russia have been fired, others remain in their positions. Ukraine has a constitutional ban on judges and other officials with foreign passports. Shulika went to Crimea in 2014 after its illegal annexation by Russia and visited Russia several times from 2015 to 2019. &quot;This is absolutely unacceptable,&quot; Mykhailo Zhernakov, executive director of the judicial watchdog the Dejure Foundation, wrote in a post on Facebook. &#x201C;Not only do they help representatives of the judicial mafia remain in their positions but also allow sympathizers of Russia to take vacant positions in the judicial system,&#x201D; he said. Ukraine&apos;s judiciary is still notoriously corrupt despite repeated attempts to reform it, according to watchdogs. Some Ukrainian judges have routinely obstructed justice and blocked reforms. &#x201C;How do you like this &apos;reformed&apos; body? And what do you think &#x2014; will they let us into the EU with this kind of system?&quot; The High Council of Justice did not respond to a request for comment. Zhernakov said the appointment of judges who visited Russia and the occupied territories during the war violates the High Council of Justice&apos;s own guidelines. This is not the first scandal around a judge with ties to Russia. Bohdan Lvov, a former deputy chairman of the Supreme Court, received Russian citizenship in 1999 and still had a valid Russian passport, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&apos;s Schemes investigation project reported in 2022. Schemes cited official information from Russia&#x2019;s Federal Tax Service and leaked documents from Russia&#x2019;s official passport database. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) later confirmed that Lvov had Russian citizenship. Vsevolod Knyazev, then head of the Supreme Court, fired Lvov in October 2022 due to a constitutional ban on judges having foreign citizenship. The Kyiv District Administrative Court issued a ruling in January 2024 to reinstate Lvov as a Supreme Court judge. The court claimed that there was not enough proof of Lvov&#x2019;s Russian citizenship. In June 2024, an appellate court reversed the ruling and rejected Lvov&apos;s lawsuit for reinstatement.	https://kyivindependent.com/appointment-of-judge-who-visited-occupied-crimea-russia-triggers-criticism/	2025-01-15T07:35:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-479350285.jpg
Polish PM accuses Russia of planning 'air terror,' condemns sabotage efforts	Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Jan. 15 accused Russia of planning terrorist attacks against international airlines, including in Poland. &quot;Russia has been planning air terror &#x2014; not only against Poland but also against airlines around the world,&quot; he said during a joint press conference with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Warsaw. Tusk&apos;s remarks come after a Jan. 14 New York Times report claiming the outgoing U.S. administration warned Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt intelligence operations involving planting incendiary devices on U.S.-bound cargo planes. &quot;These acts of sabotage are versions of the war that Russia has declared to the whole world, not just Ukraine. They require joint action, and Poland plays a key role in countering such threats,&quot; Tusk said. U.S. intelligence reportedly intercepted communications in August 2024 among Russian secret service officers discussing plots to smuggle incendiary devices onto cargo planes. Moscow has been suspected of being behind incidents in July 2024, where several parcels sent by individuals caught fire in warehouses in Germany and the U.K. Had these fires occurred mid-flight, they could have resulted in catastrophic crashes. U.S. media reported these operations were intended as preparations for similar plots targeting the U.S. and Canada, which reportedly raised alarm among White House officials. Zelensky traveled to Poland to meet Tusk after reaching a &quot;breakthrough&quot; agreement over World War II exhumations, a long-standing source of tension between the nations. The leaders emphasized shared efforts to counter Russian aggression and address regional security challenges. Zelensky and Tusk last met in December 2024 in Lviv to discuss historical reconciliation, including issues surrounding the Volyn massacre.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-pm-accuses-russia-of-planning-global-airline-terror-attacks-condemns-sabotage-efforts/	2025-01-15T06:23:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193453413.jpg
Ukraine brings back 25 people from Russian captivity, including Azovstal defenders	Ukraine managed to bring back 25 Ukrainians from Russian captivity including Azovstal defenders, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Jan. 15. &quot;Returning our people home is something that Ukraine is constantly working on. And we will not stop until we bring all of our people back,&quot; Zelensky said in a post on Telegram. The returning Ukrainian POWs were captured during the defense of Mariupol and its Azovstal steel plant, as well as during the defense of other key areas of the front line in Kharkiv, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts, Zelensky added. He said some of those brought back have serious injuries and illnesses. Bringing our people home is what Ukraine is constantly working on, and we will not stop until we bring all of our people back. Today, 25 more of our people are returning home to Ukraine. These are our military and civilians. Among them are the defenders of Mariupol and&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/wDMeTUxYK0 The exchange was conducted on a 25 for 25 basis. In a recent agreement, Russia and Ukraine agreed to prioritize wounded POWs at selection of exchanges, followed by those held longest in captivity. President Zelensky also expressed his gratitude for the United Arab Emirates for mediating between the parties. Over the past year, Ukraine conducted 11 prisoner exchanges and secured the return of 356 more people than in 2023. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Nearly 4,000 people have been released, including 1,358 in 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-brings-back-25-people-from-russian-captivity-including-azovstal-defenders/	2025-01-15T05:27:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-15-at-15_18_38.png
Strongest action possible' — Albanese vows to act if Australian fighting for Ukraine was executed by Russia	Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese pledged the &quot;strongest action possible&quot; during a Jan. 15 press conference if reports of an Australian national captured while fighting for Ukraine being executed by Russian forces are confirmed, CNN reported. Oscar Jenkins, a 32-year-old teacher from Melbourne, was reported captured by Russian forces in December. Ukrainian sources told 7News that Jenkins&apos; body had been found, suggesting he was executed by his captors. Australia&apos;s Foreign Ministry has summoned the Russian ambassador to demand information and stress compliance with international law. Albanese said his government seeks &quot;urgent clarification&quot; and described the reports as &quot;gravely concerning.&quot; &quot;If there has been any harm caused to Oscar Jenkins, that is absolutely reprehensible,&quot; Albanese said, as reported by CNN. He did not specify potential actions Canberra might take. In late December, Russian Telegram channels circulated a video showing Jenkins in military fatigues, interrogated and beaten by his captors. Jenkins is seen providing his name and background as the interrogators question his desire to live. Jenkins introduces himself in the video as a biology teacher who came to help Ukraine and is now based near Kramatorsk, a city in Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk Oblast, located approximately 700 kilometers (430 miles) east of Kyiv, and 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of the front line. The Geneva Conventions require humane treatment of prisoners of war (POWs) and prohibit executions, which are classified as war crimes. Russia has repeatedly been accused of violating these laws by summarily executing Ukrainian POWs. Moscow, however, labels foreign volunteers as &quot;mercenaries&quot; and denies them the protections afforded to POWs under international law. If confirmed, Jenkins&apos; execution would mark the first instance of an Australian volunteer fighter captured and executed by Russian forces since the full-scale invasion began. At least six Australians are believed to have been killed fighting for Ukraine. The Australian government and Ukrainian authorities continue to investigate Jenkins&apos; fate.	https://kyivindependent.com/strongest-action-possible-pm-albanese-pledges-action-if-australian-fighting-for-ukraine-was-executed-by-russia/	2025-01-15T04:59:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1257670533.jpeg
Putin's war economy is running on fumes as inflation and shortages surge	Russian President Vladimir Putin frequently boasts about the strength of his country&#x2019;s economy, claiming that Western sanctions only made it stronger (while in the same breath demanding that they be lifted). In fact, &#x201C;stagflation&#x201D; &#x2014; inflation combined with minimal growth &#x2014; is coming to Russia. His war on Ukraine has caused both high and rising prices and labor shortages, because many workers have been mobilized or killed, while many others have fled the country. Heading into the Russian Central Bank&#x2019;s regularly scheduled board meeting in late December, most observers expected monetary authorities to raise the policy rate from 21% to 23%. Yet the Russian Central Bank kept the rate unchanged, despite an increase in the official annual inflation figure, from 8.4% to 9.5% in the space of two months. It is easy to guess what happened. Just a day before, Putin said he had spoken with Russian Central Bank Chair Elvira Nabiullina, and it is safe to assume that he told her to leave the policy rate where it is. Any illusion about the Russian Central Bank&apos;s independence vanished. For the first time, Putin appears to have listened to Russia&#x2019;s oligarchs rather than the professional economists overseeing monetary policy. In the last couple of months, numerous top loyalists and businessmen &#x2014; from Sergei Chemezov of Rostec (defense production) and Igor Sechin of Rosneft (oil) to Alexander Shokin of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs &#x2014; have bitterly complained that high interest rates will drive many companies into bankruptcy. These warnings are not unfounded. Since the Russian government ended mortgage subsidies last July, sales of newly built properties have plummeted by around 50%, pushing Russia&#x2019;s two biggest real-estate developers, Samolet and PIK, to the brink of insolvency. Meanwhile, Russia&#x2019;s official inflation figure becomes less credible by the day. According to the independent research firm ROMIR, the average cost of a Russian basket of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), such as food and household chemicals, had risen by 22.1% year on year in September. The company has published no new inflation readings since. It is easy to guess why. Oil storage tanks are illuminated at night at the RN-Tuapsinsky refinery, operated by Rosneft Oil Co., in Tuapse, Russia, on March 22, 2020. (Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images)To be sure, the FMCG price index does not reflect overall consumer inflation, since it does not track the prices of durable goods and services, which have risen less sharply compared to food prices. Yet there can be little doubt that the official Russian price index figure is too low. We might not know whether inflation is 12% or 22%, but we can be quite confident that it is higher than 9.5%. Even at Putin&#x2019;s own highly choreographed annual press conference last month, inflation was the dominant concern. Russia&#x2019;s inflation is not overtly caused by fiscal profligacy. On the contrary, the Kremlin has long maintained budget surpluses (though it did register a small budget deficit of around 2% of GDP in 2022 and 2023, and it is likely to do so again in 2024). The Russia expert and former banker Craig Kennedy, however, has recently uncovered evidence that since mid-2022, the Kremlin has been strong-arming Russian banks to lend to war-related businesses on preferential terms. This off-budget financing scheme has contributed to a $415 billion surge in corporate borrowing, boosting inflation and rendering Russia&#x2019;s finances highly vulnerable. For a normal country, a budget deficit of 2% of GDP would be of no concern. But Russia is not a normal country. It has been the subject of Western financial sanctions since July 2014, and these have been quite effective at blocking access to international financing. Russia&#x2019;s total private and public foreign debt has fallen from $729 billion at the end of 2013 to $293 billion at the end of September 2024. Yet nobody &#x2014; including Chinese state banks &#x2014; dares to lend it money. Starved of financing, Russia has raised taxes substantially this year. Abandoning the 13% flat income tax established in 2000, it has introduced a progressive income tax system with rates starting at 15% and rising to 22% for top earners. Meanwhile, the tax rate on corporate profits has increased from 20% to 25%. But since these changes will generate only around 1.4% of GDP more in state revenues, the rest of the deficit must be financed with domestic bonds whose interest rates have already skyrocketed, doubling the cost of debt service as a share of total expenditure since 2019. Russia thus remains dependent on a single source of financing: the National Wealth Fund, whose liquid reserves have fallen from $117 billion in 2021 to $31 billion at the end of November. That is only enough to finance three-quarters of the budget deficit in 2025. Western financial sanctions have also weighed on the ruble, which has sunk from 34 to the dollar in 2013 to 103 today. This, too, aggravates inflation, because the central bank no longer has the reserves to defend the exchange rate (by spending dollars to buy rubles). Though Russia has stopped publishing most of its foreign-trade statistics, the Bank of Finland Institute for Emerging Economics (whose scientific council I chair) estimates that its total exports plummeted by 28% (to $425 billion) from 2022 to 2023. Most likely, they remained at the same level in 2024, because Western energy sanctions had not been significantly tightened, although the outgoing Biden administration did so on January 10. At the same time, tighter Western technology sanctions have had devastating effects on Russian manufacturing. Of the 108 airliners Russia planned to build since 2022, only seven have been completed. Dire conditions in the civilian sector presumably extend to the armaments sector, which is largely monopolized by Chemezov&#x2019;s corrupt Rostec. Strained by these factors, the Russian economy is approaching its moment of truth. Inflation will continue to rise in 2025, and people will get even angrier over higher food prices. Major bankruptcies are looming, and the Russian state cannot afford large bailouts. Business leaders are fiercely objecting to high interest rates, and the shortage of labor &#x2014; and soldiers &#x2014; is reaching a crisis stage. The most critical shortage, however, is budget financing, as Russia&#x2019;s last liquid reserves are likely to run out in the fall of 2025. Budget cuts will then become necessary. In the meantime, the war economy might also require price controls and rationing &#x2014; the old Soviet sins. As the risk of a financial crash rises, Russia&#x2019;s imperiled economy is about to pose serious constraints on Putin&#x2019;s war. Editor&#x2019;s Note: Copyright, Project Syndicate.

Lithuania would consider troop deployment to Ukraine upon Kyiv’s request, FM Budrys says	Vilnius would consider deploying troops to Ukraine with its allies in the future if Kyiv were to make such a request, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys told LRT TV on Jan. 14. The proposal for an international peacekeeping force has gained traction recently, as European nations prepare to take a more prominent role in Ukraine&apos;s defense when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Budrys said that Lithuania did not rule out such possibilities which were touted at a summit in Paris last year when French President Emmanuel Macron invited Lithuania&#x2019;s president and others to explore expanded military involvement in Ukraine. &quot;Lithuania is a security provider in the region, not just a recipient,&quot; Budrys said. &quot;If the question arises, I have no doubt that the Lithuanian flag will be there.&quot; &quot;We&#x2019;d talk with our allies and partners about what it looks like, and we&#x2019;d talk with Ukraine about what it looks like,&quot; he added. Macron has championed the idea of deploying European troops in Ukraine since early 2024. President Volodymyr Zelensky and Macron discussed the possibility during a meeting on Dec. 18, and Macron raised the proposal again during a trilateral meeting with Trump on Dec. 7. Trump reportedly expressed interest in European-led ceasefire monitoring. On Jan. 13, Zelensky and Macron held a phone call to discuss Ukraine&#x2019;s air defense priorities and the possible deployment of peacekeepers. Both leaders agreed to meet soon to advance plans for securing guarantees for Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is also expected to visit Ukraine in the coming weeks to discuss the peacekeeping initiative, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 10.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-would-consider-troop-deployment-to-ukraine-upon-kyivs-request-fm-budrys-says/	2025-01-15T04:37:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1527606933.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine wound at least 16, kill 1 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine wounded 16 and killed one person over the past day, regional authorities, and the Office of the Prosecutor General reported on Jan. 15. Eight people, including two children were injured in Donetsk Oblast, the Office of the Prosecutor General reported on its Telegram channel, when the Russian military struck a multi-storey building in Kramatorsk. On the night of January 14-15 the Russian military attacked Ukraine with one Iskander-M/KN ballistic missile, seven Kh-22/32, 27 Kh-101/Kh-55 and four Kalibr cruise missiles, as well as four Kh-59/Kh-69 guided missiles. During the overnight attack, Russia also launched 74 Shahed-type and various other types of dummy drones, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported on their Telegram channel. Air defenses shot down 23 Kh-101/Kh-55 and three Kalibr cruise missiles, along with Kh-59/Kh-69 guided missiles. They also downed 47 drones, while 27 other drones were lost in the airspace, the Air Force said. The missiles hit critical infrastructure in Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblasts, with no reports of casualties. A 52-year-old man died, and a 74-year-old woman was injured during Russian attacks on Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported on his Telegram channel. Seven were injured as a result of Russian attacks on the city of Kherson and 36 other settlements, Kherson Oblast Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on his Telegram channel.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-wound-at-least-16-kill-1-over-past-day/	2025-01-15T04:27:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GhVGQqmXkAAx1mF.jpeg
Transnistria to receive Russian gas as humanitarian aid, head of breakaway region says	Russia will resume gas supplies to Transnistria in the form of humanitarian aid, the head of the Moscow-controlled breakaway region said on Jan. 15, but those to the rest of Moldova will remain cut off. Vadim Krasnoselsky made the announcement in a statement after returning from a trip to Moscow, where he attended talks at Russia&#x2019;s Ministry of Energy. Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom halted gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1, citing alleged unpaid debts by Moldovagaz. The gas suspension has led to widespread power outages in Transnistria, pushing the region toward industrial collapse. &quot;Gas supplies for the needs of Transnistrians and the functioning of the economy of Transnistria will be restored in the format of providing humanitarian and technical assistance to the republic,&quot; Krasnoselsky said. He did not provide technical details nor a timeline for the restoration of gas flows. Transnistrian authorities previously rejected an offer from Chisinau to help purchase gas via European platforms. While Moldova has transitioned to European energy supplies, Transnistria remains heavily reliant on Russian gas. Russian troops have been stationed in the region since the early 1990s. Gazprom&#x2019;s suspension coincided with the expiration of a deal allowing Russian gas to transit through Ukraine. However, Gazprom attributed the cutoff to Moldova&apos;s purported debt rather than transit issues. Moldovan officials dispute these claims, pointing to an international audit that failed to verify the alleged debt.	https://kyivindependent.com/transnistria-to-receive-russian-gas-humanitarian-aid/	2025-01-15T03:37:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2043777119.jpg

Biden team seeks European support to leverage frozen Russian assets in talks with Moscow, CNN reports	As the Biden administration prepares to leave office, it is reportedly urging European partners to support the transfer of frozen Russian central bank assets worth $300 billion to a special account as leverage in negotiations with Moscow, CNN reported on Jan. 15, citing anonymous administration officials. The strategy reportedly aims to pressure Moscow by signaling the funds could only be reclaimed through negotiations with Ukraine. &quot;If you want to get this money, you will have to negotiate,&quot; a source told CNN. The proposal involves moving the frozen assets, currently held primarily in European banks, to a deposit account from which withdrawals would only be allowed as part of a future peace deal with Ukraine. Biden officials are reportedly discussing the plan with President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s team, including Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio, and incoming National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. Both reportedly back the initiative, aligning with Trump&apos;s goal to expedite a resolution to the war. European governments have reportedly expressed hesitancy about the plan, citing concerns over its compliance with international law. Confiscation of frozen Russian funds has been a contentious issue, and even using the assets&apos; annual income &#x2014; around $3.2 billion &#x2014; required significant negotiation. The European Union recently disbursed &#x20AC;3 billion ($3.09 billion) to Ukraine as part of a $50 billion G7 loan initiative. The EU&apos;s &#x20AC;20 billion ($20.6 billion) contribution to the program is partially funded by income from frozen Russian assets. The U.S. has also contributed $20 billion toward the loan assistance, showcasing a concerted Western effort to support Ukraine financially while leveraging Russian assets. Outgoing President Joe Biden expressed confidence on Jan. 10 in his administration&apos;s support for Ukraine, saying he did &quot;all I could to help&quot; while voicing hope for continued U.S. backing under Trump. As the U.S. transitions to a new administration, the international community&apos;s stance on utilizing these assets may significantly influence diplomatic efforts to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-team-seeks-european-support-to-leverage-frozen-russian-assets-in-talks-with-moscow-cnn-reports/	2025-01-15T03:12:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184603402.jpg
Ukrainians divided over what peace with Russia should look like, new poll reveals	There is no clear consensus among Ukrainians about what a potential peace agreement with Russia should look like, a new global poll published on Jan. 15 has found. The poll, conducted by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), presented respondents with four options relating to NATO/EU membership, security guarantees, and ceding/regaining occupied territories. Not one gained a majority for or against from respondents. (European Council on Foreign Relations)&quot;Such disagreements could stoke political turmoil if and when negotiations begin,&quot; the report reads. Though peace negotiations are a long way off, the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 20 has accelerated discussion of their possibility in Kyiv, Moscow, and capitals around the world. Trump vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table and swiftly end the full-scale war that nears its third anniversary. Earlier this week, he told reporters that arrangements for a meeting with Putin are underway. The wide-ranging, global poll surveyed respondents in 16 European countries including the U.K., Russia, and Ukraine, and eight non-European countries including Brazil, China, India, Saudi Arabia, and the U.S. about attitudes towards the U.S. and international powers ahead of Trump&apos;s inauguration. Many of the questions related to Trump&apos;s possible influence on global events such as the wars in Ukraine, and the Middle East, as well as the future balance of global power. In Ukraine, expectations of an outright victory in the war against Russia have fallen sharply in just the last six months since the poll was last conducted, from 58% in May 2024, to 34% in November 2024. Of the options available, most Ukrainians &#x2014; 47% &#x2014; now say a compromise settlement with Russia is the most likely outcome of the war. (European Council on Foreign Relations)Ukrainians are split on whether or not the incoming Trump administration will make peace more or less likely &#x2014; 39% say it will be more likely, 35% less likely, and 26% say it will make no difference. (European Council on Foreign Relations)The question is still largely hypothetical &#x2014; despite multiple promises during the U.S. presidential election campaign to negotiate an end to the war as soon as he was elected, Donald Trump is yet to lay out any concrete plans of how he intends to do so. Tempering expectations further, Trump&apos;s choice for special Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, earlier this month said Trump wants to end the war in 100 days. Then there is the issue of what Trump will demand from both sides. While much of the election rhetoric from Trump and his allies suggested Kyiv could be forced to pay a heavy price and cede territory, Kellogg has also sought to play this down. &quot;People need to understand, he&apos;s not trying to give something to Putin or to the Russians, he&apos;s actually trying to save Ukraine and save their sovereignty,&quot; Kellogg said. &quot;And he&apos;s going to make sure that it&apos;s equitable and it&apos;s fair.&quot; As for the global implications of a second Trump presidency, and how he deals with issues such as the war in Ukraine, the poll found a wide range of views across the countries polled. In India, China, and Brazil, majorities or pluralities believe Trump will be a &quot;good thing&quot; for prospects of peace around the world, as well as for their own countries. But in countries more allied with the U.S. there was skepticism &#x2014; only 24% of those in the UK, 31% in South Korea, and 34% in the EU countries polled said Trump&apos;s presidency would make peace in Ukraine more likely, while even fewer thought the same about the Middle East. The authors of the report suggested that while there is obviously a nervousness in Europe about Trump, there is also an opportunity for Europe to reassert itself on the global stage. &quot;Europe may stand almost alone in a Trumpian world, but this doesn&#x2019;t mean we Europeans are powerless to act,&quot; historian Timothy Garton Ash said, adding: &quot;There are opportunities in this new, transactional space for alliances and influence. &quot;Indeed, the very fact that the EU is held in such high regard by people in so many countries and is even expected to grow in strength in the coming decade, should give leaders hope that there is room for a strong and independent-minded Europe in the world.&quot; The poll was conducted in November 2024 in 16 European countries (Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, T&#xFC;rkiye, Ukraine and the United Kingdom), and eight non-European countries (Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea and the United States). The total number of respondents was 28,549.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-divided-over-what-peace-with-russia-should-look-like-new-poll-reveals/	2025-01-15T02:45:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2191058089.jpg
‘We know how the good guy is’ — Trump’s defense nominee grilled over war in Ukraine	President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s nominee for defense secretary was grilled over the war in Ukraine during a confirmation hearing on Jan. 14, after he failed to mention Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion during his opening remarks. Speaking to the Armed Services Committee, Pete Hegseth was asked if the omission was &quot;code for &apos;we&#x2019;re going to abandon Ukraine.&apos;&quot; &quot;We know who the aggressor is,&quot; Hegesth replied, adding: &quot;We know who the good guy is. We&#x2019;d like to see (the resolution of the war be) as advantageous for the Ukrainians as possible.&quot; &quot;But that war needs to come to an end,&quot; he added. The Armed Services Committee is expected to vote on Hegseth&#x2019;s confirmation as soon as Monday, Reuters reports. He will then be considered by the full U.S. Senate. Hegseth&#x2019;s nomination in November sent shockwaves through Pentagon corridors, with officials anonymously questioning his qualifications to lead the department. He would lead 1.3 million troops and over 750,000 civilians, preside over a $850 billion budget, and hold meetings with U.S. allies, acting as the principal defense policymaker and adviser. A former conservative talk show host on Fox News, Hegesth is seen as an isolationist who has called for reducing the U.S. commitment to the NATO military alliance. He previously served as an infantry captain in the Army National Guard, doing multiple tours of Afghanistan and Iraq. Following his discharge from the army, he became head of the conservative organization Concerned Veterans for America and, in June 2024, released a book titled &quot;The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.&quot; Hegseth also unsuccessfully ran as a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Minnesota in 2012.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-know-how-the-good-guy-is-trumps-defense-nominee-grilled-over-war-in-ukraine/	2025-01-15T01:32:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193430534.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 9	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 9 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Jan. 6&#x2013;12, 2025. This newsletter was until recently titled &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief.&quot; The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Parliament pushes forward draft law at odds with IMF requirements Last week, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, rejected draft law #12368, submitted by the Cabinet of Ministers, which aimed to establish a High Administrative Court. Instead, lawmakers backed an alternative proposal, draft law #12368-1, introduced by MP Vlasenko of the Batkivshchyna faction, in its first reading. This version designates the Kyiv City District Administrative Court to handle cases concerning the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine and Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&apos;s Office competitions and audits. For appeals it proposes to establish a separate Kyiv City Appeal Administrative Court. This move diverges from Ukraine&#x2019;s commitments under the International Monetary Fund&apos;s Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). Parliament set to vote public investment management bill During sessions scheduled for Jan. 14-17, 2025, the Verkhovna Rada will review draft law #12245 on public investment management in its second and final reading. The Budget Committee approved it on Monday morning. This legislation is crucial for meeting a structural benchmark under the MEFP, with a deadline at the end of January 2025. Transparency International Ukraine has flagged concerns over recent amendments that grant the Cabinet of Ministers authority to increase salaries for State Audit Service employees and assign special ranks and statuses to the SAS. Parliament to vote on draft law to repeal &quot;Lozovyy Amendments,&quot; rejection likely The Verkhovna Rada is set to consider a revised draft law #12367 amending the Criminal Procedure Code in its first reading. This government-backed legislation aims to fulfill obligations related to repealing the &quot;Lozovyy amendments&quot; and addressing the implications of expired pre-trial investigation time limits. Our information indicates a significant risk of rejection when it comes to a vote. The Law Enforcement Committee hasn&#x2019;t decided on the draft law during its meeting on Jan. 13. It is more likely that MPs will submit an alternative bill. Ukraine advances energy sector commitments The Verkhovna Rada has adopted draft law #12131, reinstating monitoring and reporting on greenhouse gas emissions, fulfilling a key requirement under the Ukraine Plan. The deadline for this measure was set for the end of the second quarter of 2025. Corporate governance reform sees progress Parliament has passed draft law #6013, mandating corporate governance standards across utility and state-owned enterprises. In particular, these companies will have to sell assets via &#x201C;Prozorro.Sales&#x201D; and publish financial reports. Moreover, the Cabinet of Ministers approved new procedures for evaluating the performance of supervisory boards in SOEs. Oleksii Sobolev, first deputy economy minister, noted that this includes mandatory performance assessments for the boards of Ukrenergo, Naftogaz, and the Gas Transmission System Operator (GTSO) for the previous year. The reform aims to ensure supervisory board independence and adherence to OECD corporate governance principles, requiring annual submission of development and performance reports by the end of March.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-9/	2025-01-15T01:19:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1245855806.jpg
Zelensky to visit Poland after ‘breakthrough’ agreement on Volyn tragedy exhumations	President Volodymyr Zelensky will travel to Poland on Jan 15 to meet with Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Reuters reported, after a &#x201C;breakthrough&#x201D; agreement was reached between the two countries in a long-running dispute over World War II exhumations. The Volyn massacre involved widespread violence that claimed tens of thousands of Polish and Ukrainian lives. Poland characterizes the events as genocide perpetrated by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), while Ukraine has called for shared acknowledgment of responsibility for the atrocities. Tusk announced on Jan. 10 that a decision has been made to exhume the first victims of the Volyn tragedy. &quot;There are a lot of topics (to discuss), including of course exhumations,&quot; a Polish government official was quoted as saying by Reuters. &quot;What interests us is the way these decisions (about exhumations) are carried out.&quot; They added the two leaders would hold a joint press conference in Poland. According to Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita, exhumations will begin as early as April 2025. Zelensky and Tusk previously met in Lviv in December 2024, to address historical reconciliation, including the legacy of the Volyn massacre. Tusk emphasized the importance of unity despite historical challenges. &#x201C;History certainly cannot divide us,&#x201D; he said in December 2024. The exhumations represent a significant step forward in resolving longstanding historical tensions and strengthening Polish-Ukrainian relations amid challenges posed by Russia&apos;s aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-visit-poland-after-breakthrough-agreement-on-volyn-tragedy-exhumations/	2025-01-14T23:24:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/ad251d9b370ace3d876b64ad229cbd6c_1734456764.jpeg
General Staff: Russia has lost 812,670 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 812,670 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 15. This number includes 1,580 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,780 tanks, 20,348 armored fighting vehicles, 33,995 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,975 artillery systems, 1,262 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,046 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 22,383 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-812-670-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-14T22:50:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2183596448-1.jpg
Russia launches mass missile attack against Ukraine	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched a large-scale missile attack against Ukraine on the morning of Jan. 15, launching Kh-101, Kh-22, and Kalibr cruise missiles, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported. The Russian Defense Ministry had previously threatened to retaliate after Ukraine targeted military and industrial sites throughout Russia in a mass attack on Jan. 14. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force issued a nationwide aerial alert in the early hours of Jan. 15, following warnings that a group of Tu-95MS strategic bombers had taken flight from Russia&apos;s Olenya airfield in Murmansk Oblast. Russia also reportedly launched ballistic missiles from Belgorod Oblast. Explosions were reported in Kharkiv, Khmelnytsky Oblast, and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. In Lviv Oblast, Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said Russian forces had &quot;attacked the energy infrastructure of our region and Ukraine.&quot; There are no reports of casualties or damage at this time. Shortly after eight in the morning, the all clear was given across much of the country. Poland scrambled fighter jets due to the Russian missile threat in western Ukraine, according to the Polish Operational Command. Ukraine&apos;s state grid operator, Ukrenergo, imposed emergency blackouts as a preventative measure, Energy Minister Herman Haluschenko announced.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-mass-missile-attack-against-ukraine/	2025-01-14T22:42:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1240508647.jpg
US, Armenia sign strategic partnership agreement	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan signed a strategic partnership commission charter between the U.S and Armenia on Jan. 14 in Washington, D.C. The agreement comes as Armenia, once a close ally of Russia, moves to strengthen ties with the West amid deteriorating relations with Moscow. The charter establishes a framework for expanded bilateral cooperation between the U.S. and Armenia in the areas of economic cooperation, security and defense, and democracy, among others. &quot;We are increasingly strong partners, and I think that is for the good of both of our countries as well as the good of the region and beyond,&quot; Blinken said at the signing. The two countries are also preparing to start negotations on an agreement to support Armenia&apos;s nuclear energy sector, Blinken said. &quot;Our relations, based on shared values and mutual interests, have witnessed remarkable growth in recent years,&quot; Mirzoyan said. &#xA0; &quot;They have matured to a point where upgrading them to a strategic partnership is not only fitting but essential for navigating the complex geopolitical landscape.&quot; The strategic partnership marks Armenia&apos;s latest pro-Western foreign policy move as it continues to distance itself from Russia, its traditional ally. Relations between Russia and Armenia deteriorated rapidly after Moscow failed to prevent an Azerbaijani lighting offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh in September 2023. Yerevan has since forged deeper alliances with the U.S. and Europe, signaling interest in joining the EU and breaking from the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a Russian-led security alliance.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-armenia-sign-strategic-partnership-agreement/	2025-01-14T20:25:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/armenia.png
EU considering ban on Russian LNG, aluminum, Bloomberg reports	The European Union is considering a gradual ban on Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) and new restrictions on Russian aluminum as part of its next round of sanctions, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 14, citing undisclosed officials. The EU has begun drafting its 16th round of sanctions against Russia in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The bloc aims to approve the package on Feb. 24, the third anniversary of the all-out war. The phase-out of Russian LNG could be enacted as a sanction or part of a road map presented by the European Commission next month, people familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg. Restrictions on aluminum would be gradual, with a time frame yet to be determined. The new sanctions may also target dozens of vessels belonging to Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; &#x2014; tankers that transport Russian oil products in violation of international sanctions &#x2014; and cut more banks off from the SWIFT international payment system, Bloomberg&apos;s sources said. The draft measures are currently under discussion and subject to change before they are formally presented. The EU is still debating whether to impose restrictions on Russian LNG via sanctions or as a set of regulations within a road map, or a combination thereof, undisclosed officials and diplomats said. Sanctions, which may carry the most weight, require unanimous approval of all member states. This requirement has prevented the EU from banning Russian pipeline gas, as member nations such as Slovakia and Hungary remain heavily reliant on energy imports from Russia. The EU&apos;s largest importers of Russian LNG &#x2014;&#xA0;Spain, Belgium, and France &#x2014;&#xA0;are not expected to block sanctions against Moscow, the officials said. The EU imposed its first major restrictions on Russian gas, including LNG, in its 14th sanctions package in June 2024. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen proposed replacing Russian LNG with U.S. imports in a phone call with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in November. The 16th sanctions package comes on the heels of a joint U.S.-U.K. crackdown on Russia&apos;s oil sector and shadow fleet. The two countries on Jan. 10 imposed major restrictions on over 180 Russian tankers and a number of oil companies. Following the sanctions, 65 oil tankers around the world paused operations and remain idling offshore.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-considering-ban-on-russian-lng-aluminum-bloomberg-reports/	2025-01-14T18:50:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1775102025.jpeg
Drone hits distillery in Russia's Tambov Oblast, local media reports	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A drone struck a distillery in the village of Novaya Lyada in Russia&apos;s Tambov Oblast the night of Jan. 14, the Russian Telegram news channel Astra reported, citing local residents. Local residents said a fire broke out at the distillery, which is located near a military training ground. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Russian officials have not commented on the alleged attack at the distillery. The government of Tambov Oblast claimed that air defense units intercepted a drone over the region and that it exploded &quot;in a tree.&quot; Previous drone attacks have reportedly targeted Russian alcohol plants, including facilities in Tambov Oblast. The Biokhim distillery in the town of Rasskazovo in Tambov Oblast allegedly caught fire after being struck by a drone in October 2025. The distillery advertised its manufacture of &quot;products of strategic importance for the state,&quot; including ethanol, a solvent used in the production of explosives. The reported attack on Novaya Lyada comes a day after Ukraine launched its &quot;most massive&quot; attack against Russian military and industrial facilities, covering a range of up to 1,100 kilometers (620 miles), overnight on Jan. 13-14. Ukrainian forces successfully struck chemical plants, refineries, and the Engels airbase&apos;s ammunition depots, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/drone-hits-distillery-in-russias-tambov-oblast-local-media-reports/	2025-01-14T17:47:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/distillery.png
Putin aide claims that 'Moldova will become part of another state or cease to exist', Chisinau responds	Moldovan officials have condemned recent remarks by Nikolai Patrushev, an aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who claimed that Moldova &#x201C;will either become part of another state or cease to exist&#x201D; due to its &#x201C;anti-Russian policy,&#x201D; Moldovan media outlet NewsMaker reported on January 14. Patrushev made the controversial statement in an interview, further blaming the Moldovan government for the energy crisis and urging Chisinau to &quot;not deceive itself or its people,&quot; but instead &quot;admit its mistakes and start fixing the situation.&quot; Moldova&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry called the remarks unnaceptable interference in the internal affairs of the country. &#x201C;Moldova is a sovereign state that stands firmly on the path of democracy and European integration, in line with the will of its citizens,&#x201D; the Foreign Ministry said. The energy crisis, worsened by Russia&apos;s suspension of gas supplies in December 2024, has been labeled by Chisinau as Kremlin blackmail and a threat to national security. Moldova began sourcing electricity from European markets, resulting in significant disruptions in the Russian-controlled Transnistria region, including power outages and industrial shutdowns. Transnistrian authorities previously rejected an offer from Chisinau to help purchase gas via European platforms. While Moldova has transitioned to European energy supplies, Transnistria remains heavily reliant on Russian gas. Russian troops have been stationed in the region since the early 1990s.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-aide-claims-that-moldova-will-become-part-of-another-state-or-cease-to-exist-chisinau-responds/	2025-01-14T16:26:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2178578557.jpg
Zelensky addresses personnel transfer controversy, orders Air Force commander not to reassign specialists to Ground Forces	President Volodymyr Zelensky has addressed the controversy surrounding the reassignment of Air Force personnel to the Ground Forces, in his evening address on Jan. 14. Reports indicated that since 2024, thousands of Air Force soldiers have been transferred to the Ground Forces. The latest directive was issued on Jan. 11, when Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi issued an order to transfer over 5,000 Air Force personnel to Ground Forces units. A senior Air Force officer, speaking anonymously, said transfers have now reached a &quot;critical level,&quot; with unit staffing dropping to 50%. However, this move has sparked significant debate and concern about its impact on the Air Force&#x2019;s operational capabilities. Zelensky directed Anatolii Kryvonozhko, Commander of the Ukrainian Air Force, to ensure the Air Force maintains its required personnel levels and to address public concerns about recent transfers to the Ground Forces. &quot;There has been much concern and discussion today regarding these reassignments. I have instructed that everything be explained to the public and not to reduce the ranks of specialists critical to the Air Force &#x2013; aviation, air defense, and mobile fire units,&#x201D; he said. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine also weighed in, reassuring the public that critical engineering and aviation specialists servicing aircraft are not being transferred. Instead, selected Air Force personnel are undergoing training to address personnel shortages in infantry and other units.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-addresses-personnel-transfer-controversy-orders-air-force-commander-not-to-reassign-specialists-to-ground-forces/	2025-01-14T14:02:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188503703.jpg
Slovak opposition announces no-confidence vote against PM	Slovakia&apos;s pro-Western opposition parties announced plans to initiate a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Robert Fico&apos;s government, citing concerns over his governance and foreign policy direction, TASR news agency reported on Jan. 14. The opposition &#x2014; Progressive Slovakia, Freedom and Solidarity, the Christian Democrats, and others &#x2014; criticized Fico for undermining Slovakia&apos;s pro-European stance and failing to address domestic issues such as healthcare, rising prices, and administrative inefficiencies. Opposition leader Michal Simecka of Progressive Slovakia accused Fico of steering Slovakia toward pro-Russian policies. &quot;Fico has left Slovakia,&quot; Simecka said, referencing the prime minister&apos;s recent travels, including a controversial visit to Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. Fico&apos;s Kremlin-friendly stance has drawn widespread criticism, with accusations that he prioritizes ties with autocratic regimes over Slovakia&apos;s Western alliances. Protests erupted in Slovakia&apos;s capital on Jan. 3, with thousands chanting pro-EU slogans and condemning Fico&apos;s policies. The opposition has criticized Fico&apos;s domestic governance, accusing him of neglecting pressing national issues while alienating Slovakia from its Western allies. &quot;We will not allow Fico to turn Slovakia eastward,&quot; Simecka said, as reported by Aktuality. Efforts to convene an extraordinary parliamentary session to reaffirm Slovakia&apos;s foreign policy orientation failed due to a lack of coalition support. The opposition now plans to use the no-confidence vote as a platform to challenge Fico&apos;s policies and leadership. Relations between Slovakia and Ukraine have deteriorated after Kyiv allowed a pre-war Russian gas transit deal to expire on Dec. 31, 2024. In retaliation, Fico threatened to reduce aid to Ukrainian refugees and cut electricity exports to Ukraine. Before Fico&apos;s government took power, Slovakia had been a leading supporter of Ukraine, delivering military aid and fighter jets. Fico&apos;s administration reversed this policy, halting arms shipments and adopting rhetoric critical of the West&apos;s role in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Public dissatisfaction with Fico&apos;s policies has been growing, as demonstrated by the Bratislava protests. Demonstrators carried Slovak and EU flags, played the EU anthem, and displayed banners like &quot;We are Europe&quot; and &quot;Fico, go to Moscow, leave Slovakia in peace.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/slovak-opposition-announces-no-confidence-vote-against-pm-fico-criticizing-pro-russian-stance/	2025-01-14T13:08:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190743977.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine targets Russian industrial plants, ammunition depots in overnight strike	Key developments on Jan. 14: Ukraine launched its &quot;most massive&quot; attack against Russian military and industrial facilities in a range of up to 1,100 kilometers (620 miles) overnight on Jan. 14, the General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces reported. Chemical plants, refineries, and the Engels airbase&apos;s ammunition depots were successfully targeted, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The SBU, together with the Defense Forces, continues to strike enemy military facilities and enterprises supporting Russia&#x2019;s military-industrial complex. Each hit &#x2014; whether on ammunition depots, refineries, oil depots, or chemical plants &#x2014; weakens Russia&#x2019;s capacity to wage war in Ukraine,&quot; an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. Ukrainian drones reportedly targeted multiple regions, including Saratov, Voronezh, and Orel oblasts, as well as Tatarstan. The Russian Defense Ministry did not specify the number of drones involved. Dmitry Milyaev, the governor of Russia&apos;s Tula region, described a &quot;massive drone attack&quot; in a Telegram post, claiming at least 17 drones were launched. In Aleksin, debris from a downed drone reportedly damaged vehicles and outbuildings, with no casualties reported. The SBU source indicated the Aleksino chemical plant &#x2014; producing gunpowder and ammunition for the Russian military &#x2014; was successfully hit, igniting a large fire. In Saratov and Engels, Governor Roman Busargin confirmed damage at two industrial facilities following drone strikes. The General Staff said that the Kristal oil facility in Engels, which burned for five days after an earlier strike on Jan. 8, was again successfully targeted. The Engels airfield, located in Saratov Oblast over 750 kilometers (460 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s nearest controlled territory, allegedly sustained hits to ammunition depots containing FAB glide bombs, KAB bombs, and cruise missiles. The Saratov oil refinery was also reportedly engulfed in a fire. Engels hosts three types of Russian strategic bombers &#x2014; the Tupolev Tu-95, Tu-22, and Tu-160 &#x2014; all frequently used to launch missile strikes on Ukrainian cities. Mikhail Isayev, the acting head of the Engels district, announced that schools in the city would transition to remote learning due to the continued threat of drone strikes. Explosions were reported in the town of Seltso near Bryansk, where the chemical plant reportedly was hit, according to the Russian opposition Telegram channel Astra. Ukraine&#x2019;s Unmanned Systems Forces confirmed the strike, saying that the plant produces gunpowder, explosives, and missile fuel components, including ammunition for barrel artillery, multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), aircraft, and Kh-59 cruise missiles. It also carries out overhauls of Grad, Uragan, and Tornado-G MLRS. The unit reported that the drones distracted Russian air defense, paving the way for missiles to hit the main targets. Following the missile strike, long-range drones allegedly destroyed substations and other critical infrastructure. In Tatarstan&#x2019;s capital, Kazan, a fuel facility was struck in the early hours of Jan. 14, igniting a gas tank. The fire occurred about 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Tatarstan Republic head Rustam Minnikhanov confirmed that a fire broke out in the city as a result of the drone strike but claimed that it resulted in no significant damage. &quot;I went to the scene of a fire that occurred as a result of the drone attack. Emergency services quickly arrived at the scene to extinguish the fire. I heard reports that there were no casualties or serious damage,&quot; Minnikhanov wrote on his Telegram channel. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. Ukraine&apos;s immediate focus is on adequately equipping its military, rather than further reducing the draft age, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 14, according to Interfax-Ukraine. &quot;When we talk about increasing the number of our people (in the military), we must first address the issue of adequately equipping our brigades. Our partners have all these requests,&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky noted that Ukraine fields over 100 brigades, all requiring sustained staffing and consistent resupply of equipment to maintain their combat effectiveness. The remarks follow reports that U.S. lawmakers and NATO allies are urging Ukraine to lower its draft age from 25 to 18 to address manpower shortages. U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration has reportedly advocated for the move as part of broader efforts to address Ukraine&apos;s personnel needs at the full-scale war with Russia stretches into its third year. However, Kyiv has resisted the proposal, citing concerns over equipment shortages and the economic impact of drafting younger workers. Under martial law, men aged 18 to 60 are prohibited from leaving Ukraine, but only those aged 25 and older are eligible for the draft. The Ukrainian government lowered the draft age from 27 to 25 in April 2024, adding 50,000 troops to its forces. While the measure bolstered numbers, it fell short of meeting the military&apos;s full requirements. The Ukrainian Air Force will transfer military personnel &quot;en masse&quot; to reinforce the Ground Forces&apos; combat brigades in early 2025, Ukrainska Pravda reported on Jan. 14, citing an undisclosed Air Force source. Facing an infantry shortage along the front lines, Ukraine has been forced to make difficult adjustments as Russia ramps up its offensive in Donetsk Oblast. According to Ukrainska Pravda, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi issued an order on Jan. 11 to transfer over 5,000 Air Force personnel to Ground Forces units. A senior Air Force officer, speaking anonymously, said transfers began in spring 2024 and have now reached a &quot;critical level,&quot; with unit staffing dropping to 50%. &quot;If we carry out the order of the 11th, which was sent to us by the commander-in-chief, the manning of units will drop to 40%&quot; the officer told Ukrainska Pravda. They added that even transferring &quot;unimportant personnel&quot; weakens unit effectiveness, particularly for anti-aircraft missile systems, which rely on cohesive teams. Over 200 personnel are reportedly set to be taken from seven Air Force brigades, including units defending Kyiv, Ukrainska Pravda reported, citing an undisclosed source. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. In a Jan. 14 statement, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces denied transferring Air Force engineering and aviation personnel to infantry units, emphasizing that technical and flight personnel numbers are increasing. However, some Air Force and other branch personnel, after training, are being reassigned to strengthen ground brigades due to a critical infantry shortage. The General Staff noted this as a necessary measure to bolster frontline defense but confirmed that specialists in high-tech roles or those trained abroad on foreign equipment are exempt from transfers. Germany will deploy the promised Patriot air defenses around the Polish airport of Rzeszow by the end of January, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said during his visit to Warsaw on Jan. 13. Monitoring group German Aid to Ukraine wrote earlier that two MIM-104 Patriot fire units and a total of 200 Bundeswehr soldiers will be deployed to Poland for an estimated six months to protect Polish airspace. Pistorius called Rzeszow a key logistics hub for Ukraine and said he would personally ensure that the U.S.-made air defenses begin operating by the end of the month. The Rzeszow-Jasionka airport is located less than 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the Ukrainian border and transports a significant percentage of Western materiel bound for the front lines in Ukraine. It is also a main stopover point for foreign leadership traveling to Kyiv on official visits. Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said that the airport is also a key conduit for humanitarian support heading to Ukraine, adding that more than 90% of all allied aid flows through it. Currently, a NASAMS air defense system protects the airport, which is manned by Norwegian soldiers. Kyiv&apos;s European partners are growing optimistic that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will not pressure Ukraine into accepting a painful peace deal, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 14, citing undisclosed European officials. Following closed-door talks with Trump&apos;s team, the officials see a rising chance that the new U.S. leadership will seek to help Ukraine negotiate from the position of strength, the outlet wrote. Trump, returning to the White House on Jan. 20, initially caused concern among the pro-Kyiv coalition by his declared sympathies for Russian President Vladimir Putin and criticism of the Biden administration&apos;s military support for Ukraine. The president-elect has reportedly proved more flexible on the matter than expected. His team is particularly receptive to arguments about Russia&apos;s victory emboldening China and dealing the U.S. a humiliation similar to the Taliban&apos;s victory in Afghanistan in 2021, according to Bloomberg&apos;s sources. Trump has pledged to bring a swift end to the war but provided few details on how he plans to achieve this. A pitch leaked from his team &#x2014; freezing the front lines, postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2014; has already been rejected by Russia. There were other signals that Trump does not intend to cut the support for Ukraine completely as part of his plan to resolve the war. Speaking to the Time magazine, the president-elect said he would not &quot;abandon&quot; the besieged country, though criticizing the Biden administration for permitting long-range strikes on Russian soil. According to the Financial Times, Trump told the Europan allies he plans to continue supporting Ukraine while asking them to raise their defense spending levels to 5% of GDP. This echoes Trump&apos;s earlier appeals to Europe to take up greater responsibility both for Ukraine&apos;s defense and for their own security.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-targets-russian-industrial-plants-ammunition-depots-in-overnight-strike/	2025-01-14T12:12:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-14-at-12_47_35-PM.png
Seoul to consult with Kyiv on transfer of captured North Korean soldiers, Yonhap reports	Seoul plans to hold consultations with Kyiv regarding the transfer of captured North Korean soldiers if they request defection, Yonhap reported on Jan. 14, citing South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lee Jae-woong. President Volodymyr Zelensky recently announced the capture of two North Korean soldiers in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. &quot;Since North Korean soldiers are our citizens under the constitution, our government plans to have talks with Ukraine if they ask to defect to South Korea,&quot; Lee said. The South Korean constitution defines the entire Korean peninsula as its territory and considers all residents as citizens. However, neither of the captured soldiers has expressed a willingness to be transferred to South Korea, Lee added. Seoul remains in contact with Kyiv on matters related to the captured North Korean soldiers. North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces against a Ukrainian incursion launched on Aug. 6. Ukrainian troops continue to operate in the region, leveraging their positions for potential future negotiations. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) estimates that North Korean casualties have reached 300 killed and 2,700 wounded, attributing the losses to inadequate training and ineffective counter-drone tactics. The NIS also reported that some North Korean soldiers have been forced to commit suicide to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby echoed these claims on Dec. 27, adding that captured North Korean troops fear severe retaliation against their families if they surrender.	https://kyivindependent.com/seoul-to-consult-with-kyiv-on-transfer-of-captured-north-korean-soldiers-yonhap-reports/	2025-01-14T12:09:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-11_13-23-35--3-.jpg
Biden leaves nearly $4 billion in US aid to Ukraine unused. What will happen to them under Trump?	U.S. President Joe Biden will be passing around $3.8 billion in the so-called Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) to his successor &#x2014; Donald Trump. On the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly criticized the Biden administration for providing Ukraine with military assistance, including through military shipments using the PDA. Countering Trump&apos;s rhetoric, the outgoing administration stated its desire to use the available funds to help Kyiv withstand the ongoing Russian offensive in the country&apos;s east. &quot;We are determined &#x2014; and it&apos;s fully my intent and the president&apos;s (Joe Biden) intent &#x2014; to spend every cent that we have available from the $61 billion that was authorized by Congress in the supplemental appropriation,&quot; U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at the end of 2024. The Kyiv Independent explains what the Presidential Drawdown Authority is, how it was used, and why the Biden administration failed to use up the funds provided to him by Congress. On Jan. 9, the outgoing president signed into force a military aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million. The aid package was said to be the last one before a new administration takes office on Jan. 20. The last tranche included missiles for air defense, air-to-ground munitions, armored bridging systems, as well as equipment to support Ukraine&apos;s use of F-16 fighter jets. The final aid package from the Biden administration was expected to be much larger, with nearly $4.3 billion in available funding open to the president&apos;s signing at the start of 2025.

(Saul Loeb / AFP via Getty Images)Despite the ongoing attempts to frame Biden&apos;s military aid shipments as a charity, the PDA doesn&apos;t involve actual funds being spent. The PDA allows Washington to supply Ukraine with military equipment from existing U.S. military stockpiles, considered to be surplus, which can begin arriving within days of approval. The sums showing up in White House reports are an estimated value of the equipment provided and shipped to the recipient country. Concerns over the fact that Biden&apos;s administration won&apos;t be able to provide the promised funding arose months prior. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the crucial foreign aid package, which included around $61 billion for Ukraine, in April 2024. The bill was first introduced in October 2023, yet was delayed for months due to political infighting in the lower chamber of the U.S. Congress. Following Trump&apos;s election victory, the Biden administration rushed military aid shipments to Ukraine. Soon, the U.S. aid packages to Kyiv shrank. The Pentagon has reached the limit of weapons it can send to Ukraine monthly without affecting its own combat capability and started facing logistical problems in delivering weapons, the Wall Street Journal reported in late November, citing unnamed U.S. officials. Pentagon spokesperson Major General Pat Ryder said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) published on Jan. 10 that Washington has to balance its own readiness needs, as well as look at what the U.S. do to support Ukraine. Asked again, a few days later, why the U.S. was unable to provide all the PDA authorization to Ukraine, Ryder dodged the question, adding that &quot;the authority will get passed to the next administration and it will be their call on whether they will choose to expend &#x2014; or employ that authority to expend those funds.&quot; &quot;It could be a simple political calculation to avoid leaving the Trump administration with a completely zero balance (in aid to Ukraine),&quot; Vladyslav Faraponov, the head of the Kyiv-based Institute of American Studies, told the Kyiv Independent.

(Rebecca Noble / Getty Images)Meanwhile, Daria Kaleniuk, co-founder of the Kyiv-based NGO Anti Corruption Action Center (ANTAC), said that Biden failed to fulfill his promise. She also blamed Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry for not being ready for such a scenario and not persuading the Pentagon to move forward with the promised aid. Kaleniuk told the Kyiv Independent that the ANTAC and other experts had warned the Defense Ministry that Washington would run out of time to spend all the money and that it lacked the necessary military hardware requested by Ukraine, primarily air defense systems and missiles. Kaleniuk suggested that the remaining U.S. funds could have been redirected to other arms assistance programs in case of better cooperation. Kyiv could also expand the list of weapons priorities to include lower-priority equipment that might still be available in stockpiles, she added. &quot;By the time we realized, it was too late,&quot; Kaleniuk said. The Kyiv Independent sent a request for comments to Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry but has not received a response at the time of publication. The remaining PDA funds are now at Trump&apos;s disposal. &quot;It&apos;s really up to the incoming administration to decide what they use &#x2014; what they decide to do with the remaining authority that&apos;s left,&quot; Pentagon&apos;s deputy spokesperson Sabrina Singh said on Jan. 8. When asked if the Biden administration is concerned about remaining funds and if there is a danger of a lag, she answered that Ukraine has &quot;strong&quot; bipartisan support within Congress. Under the Biden administration, the U.S. has committed over $66.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, the Pentagon said. Washington also provides Ukraine with aid through the USAI (Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative), a Pentagon-led program that supplies arms to Ukraine through contracts with U.S. defense companies. Another program, Foreign Military Financing (FMF), enables Ukraine to purchase weapons and munitions from U.S. defense companies. Under Biden&apos;s administration, Ukraine was provided with the long-awaited High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), Patriot air-defense systems, and Abrams battle tanks. But protracted decision-making on the provision of much-needed weapons, such as ATACMS long-range missiles and permission to use the provided missiles against targets deep inside Russia, slowed Ukraine&apos;s ability to fight back.

(Ozge Elif Kizil/Anadolu via Getty Images)The holdup on approving U.S. aid in 2024 led to the fall of the key eastern city of Avdiivka in Donetsk Oblast, followed by the loss of several other major towns in the region. Faraponov suggests that Trump will use the remaining money, but not immediately. Trump&apos;s administration may utilize it as leverage or as a bargaining chip in potential negotiations. &quot;The decision (to provide Ukraine with more aid) will be less popular with the Republican audience, in particular, who are generally skeptical of all international aid,&quot; he said. &quot;For the Trump administration, it is less risky in terms of reputation to transfer these remaining funds than to promote another aid package in Congress.&quot; Kaleniuk also believes that the remaining $3.8 billion may be used for Ukraine under the Trump administration. &quot;But the change of any administration implies a delay in decision-making. That is why we can get bogged down in their internal political struggle.	https://kyivindependent.com/nearly-4-billion-in-us-aid-to-ukraine-remained-unused-what-will-happen-to-them/	2025-01-14T12:07:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2188625792.jpg
Germany continues talks on $3 billion aid package for Ukraine, Pistorius says	The German government is still discussing a proposed 3 billion euros ($3.09 billion) aid package for Ukraine, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said on Jan. 14, according to Ukrinform. Pistorius, who made an unannounced visit to Kyiv, met with Ukrainian officials to discuss defense industry cooperation, including boosting joint ventures and direct procurement of Ukrainian defense production with European funds. &quot;We have prepared everything we need, but we are still in the process of negotiations within the government because there is still the issue of funds that are not yet available because there is still no budget,&quot; Pistorius said. Pistorius assured that Germany&#x2019;s support for Ukraine would remain &quot;reliable, unwavering, committed, and energetic&quot; regardless of the outcome of Germany&#x2019;s Feb. 23 elections. On Jan. 9, Der Spiegel reported that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz blocked an additional military aid package, allegedly arguing that the 4 billion euros ($4.1 billion) already allocated for 2025, along with funds from a $50 billion G7 loan financed by frozen Russian assets, should suffice. Pistorius denied the report, stating that no final decision on the funding had been made. Germany, under Scholz&#x2019;s leadership, has become Ukraine&#x2019;s second-largest military donor after the U.S., though Scholz has faced criticism for his cautious stance on key issues, including his refusal to supply Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-government-continues-discussions-on-providing-ukraine-with-aid-worth-3-billion-pistorius-says/	2025-01-14T12:05:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/PistoriusRamstein.jpg
Transnistria head travels to Russia for talks amid energy crisis, Russian state media claims	Vadim Krasnoselsky, the head of Moldova&apos;s Russian-controlled region of Transnistria, held talks in Moscow regarding the region&#x2019;s energy crisis, Russian state news agency TASS claimed on Jan. 14, citing sources within Transnistria&apos;s administration. TASS did not specify whom Krasnoselsky met with during his visit. The crisis began when Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom halted gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1, citing alleged unpaid debts by Moldovagaz. The gas suspension has led to widespread power outages in Transnistria, pushing the region toward industrial collapse. Transnistrian authorities previously rejected an offer from Chisinau to help purchase gas via European platforms. While Moldova has transitioned to European energy supplies, Transnistria remains heavily reliant on Russian gas. Russian troops have been stationed in the region since the early 1990s. Gazprom&#x2019;s suspension coincided with the expiration of a deal allowing Russian gas to transit through Ukraine. However, Gazprom attributed the cutoff to Moldova&apos;s purported debt rather than transit issues. Moldovan officials dispute these claims, pointing to an international audit that failed to verify the alleged debt.	https://kyivindependent.com/transnistria-head-travels-to-russia-for-talks-amid-energy-crisis-russian-state-media-claims/	2025-01-14T10:56:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1235528511.jpg
Metinvest suspends operations at Pokrovsk coal mine amid security concerns	Metinvest, Ukraine&apos;s largest steel producer, has suspended operations at the Pokrovsk coking coal mine in Donetsk Oblast due to worsening security conditions and power outages, the company announced on Jan. 14. Located 10 kilometers (6 miles) west of Pokrovsk, the mine is one of Eastern Europe&#x2019;s largest and Ukraine&#x2019;s sole producer of coking coal, a key component in steelmaking&#x2014;Ukraine&apos;s second-largest export after agriculture. The mine remains under Ukrainian control, and Metinvest is evacuating employees and their families. &quot;The suspension of operations is a necessary step to preserve lives during these challenging times. We believe in Ukraine&apos;s victory and are prepared to resume operations and rebuild Pokrovsk after the Russian invasion is repelled,&quot; said Metinvest CEO Yuriy Ryzhenkov. To sustain steel production at its plants in Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, Metinvest has developed a contingency plan. This includes sourcing coking coal from the U.S.-based United Coal Company, utilizing existing reserves, and securing additional supplies from third-party vendors. Pokrovsk, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian forces, has been the focus of fierce fighting as Russia intensifies its offensive in Donetsk Oblast. Steel exports generated nearly $2 billion in the first eight months of 2024, with production projected to reach 7.5 million metric tons by year-end. Plans to increase output to over 10 million tons in 2025 are now threatened, as the loss of Pokrovsk could slash annual production to 2-3 million tons, according to Reuters.	https://kyivindependent.com/metinvest-suspends-operations-at-pokrovsk-coking-coal-mine-amid-security-concerns/	2025-01-14T10:11:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190947297.jpg
Ukraine denies transferring Air Force personnel to infantry amid troop shortages	The Ukrainian Air Force will transfer military personnel &quot;en masse&quot; to reinforce the Ground Forces&apos; combat brigades in early 2025, Ukrainska Pravda reported on Jan. 14, citing an undisclosed Air Force source. Facing an infantry shortage along the front lines, Ukraine has been forced to make difficult adjustments as Russia ramps up its offensive in Donetsk Oblast. According to Ukrainska Pravda, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi issued an order on Jan. 11 to transfer over 5,000 Air Force personnel to Ground Forces units. A senior Air Force officer, speaking anonymously, said transfers began in spring 2024 and have now reached a &quot;critical level,&quot; with unit staffing dropping to 50%. &quot;If we carry out the order of the 11th, which was sent to us by the commander-in-chief, the manning of units will drop to 40%&quot; the officer told Ukrainska Pravda. They added that even transferring &quot;unimportant personnel&quot; weakens unit effectiveness, particularly for anti-aircraft missile systems, which rely on cohesive teams. Over 200 personnel are reportedly set to be taken from seven Air Force brigades, including units defending Kyiv, Ukrainska Pravda reported, citing an undisclosed source.

NATO launches Baltic Sea naval operation after undersea infrastructure sabotage	Eight NATO member states bordering the Baltic Sea unveiled a coordinated action plan on Jan. 14 to address risks to underwater infrastructure following recent cases of suspected sabotage. The declaration follows the Dec. 25 sabotage of four telecommunication cables and one power cable in the Baltic Sea, with Finnish authorities suspecting the involvement of the Russian &quot;shadow fleet&quot; vessel Eagle S. The plan was announced after a summit co-organized by Finland and Estonia, which included leaders from Denmark, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Sweden. The summit welcomed NATO&#x2019;s &quot;Baltic Sentry&quot; mission, aimed at monitoring, deterring, and responding to potential threats. Up to 10 NATO vessels will patrol the Baltic Sea until April, enhancing situational awareness and protecting critical undersea infrastructure. The leaders pledged to deter, detect, and respond robustly to any attempts at sabotage, emphasizing that hostile actions would be attributed and countered as appropriate. &quot;We are determined to attribute and counter any actions threatening our infrastructure. Any attack will be met with a robust and determined response,&quot; the statement read. NATO&#x2019;s Maritime Center for Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure, established in May, will lead efforts to deploy innovative surveillance technologies and develop rapid response mechanisms for repairing damaged infrastructure. The leaders expressed concern over Russia&apos;s so-called shadow fleet, tankers allegedly used for sanction evasion and espionage, which also threaten maritime security. &quot;We reserve our rights, in accordance with international law, to take action against any vessels circumventing sanctions and threatening security, infrastructure, and the environment,&quot; the statement said. A Memorandum of Understanding on Critical Infrastructure Protection will be prepared to coordinate joint efforts. The leaders also agreed to enhance network resilience and readiness for rapid repairs. The Baltic Sea region has witnessed growing concerns over Russian sabotage since Western nations began supporting Ukraine following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Recent incidents, including suspicious activity by Russian-registered vessels near Denmark and Sweden, have heightened tensions. The summit highlights NATO&#x2019;s commitment to safeguarding the Baltic Sea amid escalating challenges posed by Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/baltic-nato-states-unite-in-response-to-underwater-sabotage-including-russian-vessel-involvement/	2025-01-14T06:07:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1238924684--1-.jpg
Germany to deploy Patriot at Poland's key hub for Ukraine aid by end of January	Germany will deploy the promised Patriot air defenses around the Polish airport of Rzeszow by the end of January, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said during his visit to Warsaw on Jan. 13. Monitoring group German Aid to Ukraine wrote earlier that two MIM-104 Patriot fire units and a total of 200 Bundeswehr soldiers will be deployed to Poland for an estimated six months to protect Polish airspace.

Ukraine targets Russia's industrial plants, ammunition depots in 'massive' strike overnight	Ukraine launched its &quot;most massive&quot; attack against Russian military and industrial facilities in a range of up to 1,100 kilometers (620 miles) overnight on Jan. 14, the General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces reported. Chemical plants, refineries, and the Engels airbase&apos;s ammunition depots were successfully targeted, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The SBU, together with the Defense Forces, continues to strike enemy military facilities and enterprises supporting Russia&#x2019;s military-industrial complex. Each hit &#x2014; whether on ammunition depots, refineries, oil depots, or chemical plants &#x2014; weakens Russia&#x2019;s capacity to wage war in Ukraine,&quot; an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. Ukrainian drones reportedly targeted multiple regions, including Saratov, Voronezh, and Orel oblasts, as well as Tatarstan. The Russian Defense Ministry did not specify the number of drones involved. Dmitry Milyaev, the governor of Russia&apos;s Tula region, described a &quot;massive drone attack&quot; in a Telegram post, claiming at least 17 drones were launched. In Aleksin, debris from a downed drone reportedly damaged vehicles and outbuildings, with no casualties reported. The SBU source indicated the Aleksino chemical plant &#x2014; producing gunpowder and ammunition for the Russian military &#x2014; was successfully hit, igniting a large fire. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage that purports to show an attack on Tula Region, Russia, overnight on Jan. 14, 2024. (Baza/Telegram)In Saratov and Engels, Governor Roman Busargin confirmed damage at two industrial facilities following drone strikes. The General Staff said that the Kristal oil facility in Engels, which burned for five days after an earlier strike on Jan. 8, was again successfully targeted. The Engels airfield, located in Saratov Oblast over 750 kilometers (460 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s nearest controlled territory, allegedly sustained hits to ammunition depots containing FAB glide bombs, KAB bombs, and cruise missiles. The Saratov oil refinery was also reportedly engulfed in a fire. Engels hosts three types of Russian strategic bombers &#x2014; the Tupolev Tu-95, Tu-22, and Tu-160 &#x2014; all frequently used to launch missile strikes on Ukrainian cities. Mikhail Isayev, the acting head of the Engels district, announced that schools in the city would transition to remote learning due to the continued threat of drone strikes. Explosions were reported in the town of Seltso near Bryansk, where the chemical plant reportedly was hit, according to the Russian opposition Telegram channel Astra. Ukraine&#x2019;s Unmanned Systems Forces confirmed the strike, saying that the plant produces gunpowder, explosives, and missile fuel components, including ammunition for barrel artillery, multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), aircraft, and Kh-59 cruise missiles.

Following the missile strike, long-range drones allegedly destroyed substations and other critical infrastructure.

These attacks are part of Ukraine&#x2019;s ongoing efforts to undermine Russia&#x2019;s ability to sustain its full-scale invasion, striking deep into Russian territory, including regions far from the front lines.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-chemical-plants-refineries-warehouses-in-russia/	2025-01-14T05:33:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/WhatsApp-Image-2025-01-14-at-12_20_10_f5c6c958.jpg
Russian FSB officer found dead in Moscow Defense Ministry building, media reports	Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) counterintelligence officer Vladimir Feshchenko was found dead in a Russian Defense Ministry building in Moscow, Russian state-owned outlet RIA Novosti reported on Jan. 14. Preliminary information suggests he was murdered, an undisclosed source told the news agency. The pro-Kremlin Telegram channel Baza also described the death as violent, citing a deep wound in Feshchenko&#x2019;s forehead. The body was discovered in a building on Olkhovskaya Street, which houses the Russian Defense Ministry and the FSB Office for the Moscow Military District. While Baza identified Feshchenko as a Russian weightlifting champion and international master of sports, his status as an FSB officer was not indicated. The Vchk-Ogpu Telegram channel, known for connections to Russian security forces, confirmed his affiliation with the FSB. According to Vchk-Ogpu, Feshchenko was allegedly killed during a conflict with a friend with whom he had previously served in the Far East. The suspect, reportedly detained, has pleaded guilty to the murder. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The Russian Justice Ministry has designated Vchk-Ogpu as a &quot;foreign agent,&quot; accusing the Telegram channel of spreading allegedly false information about government decisions and creating a negative image of the Russian military. The FSB has gained notoriety for suppressing dissent, targeting activists, independent journalists, and pro-democracy movements. President Vladimir Putin has also tasked the agency with locating Russian nationals fighting for Ukraine&#x2019;s military or pro-Kyiv militias. Feshchenko&#x2019;s death highlights mounting internal tensions within Russia&#x2019;s security and military institutions amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-fsb-officer-found-with-fatal-head-wound-in-moscow-defense-ministry-building-media-reports/	2025-01-14T04:57:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1249616715--1-.jpg
Biden's aides warned Putin against Russia's plot to smuggle incendiary devices onto cargo planes, NYT reports	Outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s team delivered a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin to put an end to Russian intelligence&apos;s suspected plans to smuggle incendiary devices onto U.S.-bound cargo planes, The New York Times reported on Jan. 14, citing unnamed sources. Moscow has been suspected of being behind incidents in July 2024 that saw several parcels sent by individuals catch fire in warehouses in Germany and the U.K. The fires could have resulted in plane crashes if they had happened during the flight. The U.S. media wrote that these operations were intended as preparations for similar plots targeting the U.S. and Canada, which reportedly alarmed White House officials. U.S. intelligence obtained conversations in August 2024 between Russian secret service officers discussing details of the plan. The White House, uncertain whether the Russian leader knew about the plan, warned Putin through back-channel communication to stop the operation, the outlet wrote. At least five high-ranking Russian officials, including foreign intelligence chief Sergey Naryshkin, FSB head Alexander Bortnikov, and presidential advisor Yuriy Ushakov, were contacted to ensure Putin received the Biden administration&#x2019;s warning. The article does not reveal the details or nature of this warning. Russia has long engaged in a variety of disruptive behavior toward Europe, also using its cyber capabilities to target civilian infrastructure. Moscow is responsible for 80% of all the foreign influence operations in Europe, Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said at a conference in Prague in October 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/bidens-aides-sent-warnings-to-putin-not-to-send-incendiary-parcels-with-cargo-planes-nyt-reports/	2025-01-14T04:49:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184603402.jpg
Australia making 'urgent inquiries' after reports of volunteer fighter's execution in Russian captivity	Canberra is making &quot;urgent inquiries&quot; about the status of Australian citizen Oscar Jenkins, a volunteer soldier captured by Russia while fighting for &#xA0;Ukraine, after reports of his death, the 7News outlet wrote on Jan. 14. Undisclosed sources in Ukraine told 7News that the body of Jenkins, a 32-year-old teacher from Melbourne whose capture was reported in December, has been found. He is believed to have been executed by his Russian captors. Australian officials are yet to confirm Jenkins&apos; death, while Australia&apos;s Foreign Ministry has summoned the Russian ambassador to &quot;seek information&quot; and urge Moscow to comply with international law. 7News reported &quot;speculations&quot; that Jenkins&apos; body has been found but is yet to be officially identified, without providing details on the circumstances of the body&apos;s discovery. Ukrainian authorities are said to be working to verify the reports. The Kyiv Independent has contacted the Australian Embassy in Kyiv and the Ukrainian authorities but has not received a response as of publication. The Geneva Conventions mandate all warring parties to treat prisoners of war (POW) with respect and dignity, while executing POWs is considered a gross violation of international law and a war crime. Russia has been repeatedly accused of summarily executing Ukrainian POWs throughout the war. Moscow calls foreign volunteers &quot;mercenaries&quot; and claims they are not entitled to protection under the Geneva Conventions. A spokesperson of the Australian Foreign Ministry told the local media that the government has &quot;grave concerns for Mr Jenkins&apos;s welfare.&quot; If confirmed, this would be the first Australian volunteer fighter executed in Russian captivity during the full-scale war. At least six other Australians are believed to have been killed while fighting on Ukraine&apos;s side. In a video that emerged on Russian Telegram channels in late December, Jenkins is seen in military fatigues, interrogated by Russian captors. The man behind the camera asks the captive about his name and background and whether he wants to live while beating him over the head. Jenkins, who reportedly served in Ukraine&apos;s International Legion, introduces himself in the video as a biology teacher who wanted to help Ukraine and is now based near Kramatorsk, a Ukrainian city in Donetsk Oblast, around 700 kilometers (430 miles) east of Kyiv and 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of the front line. Unlike most other foreigners volunteering to join Ukraine&apos;s resistance against Russia, Jenkins has had no military experience. The Australian media described the man as &quot;much loved&quot; by his community in Australia, a talented cricket and football player who studied biomedical sciences before working as a lecturer in China. He is believed to have traveled to Ukraine in 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/australia-making-urgent-inquiries-about-volunteer-fighter/	2025-01-14T04:18:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Oscar-Jenkins.png
Will Transnistria's gas crisis lead to its collapse and reintegration into Moldova?	By halting natural gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1, Russia created an unprecedented economic crisis in the Russian-occupied part of the country &#x2014; Transnistria. The crisis prompted a question: will the breakaway region, occupied by Russia since 1992, survive without Russian gas? Free-of-charge Russian gas had been the backbone of Transnistria&apos;s economy and ensured the preservation of the breakaway region and its de facto independence from Moldova. Some argue that the gas crisis may lead to Transnistria&apos;s political collapse and reintegration into Moldova, dealing a blow to Russia&apos;s regional influence. But analysts say that Transnistria&apos;s reintegration is unlikely since it would be too difficult for Moldova to achieve, could provoke Russian aggression against Chisinau or destabilize Moldova by increasing the share of pro-Russian voters. They argue that Moldova has not taken any steps in that direction intentionally. &quot;There are far too many forces and actors in the Republic of Moldova with whose help the Russian Federation will try to prevent a possible effort to reunify the country and reintegrate Transnistria,&quot; Ion Manole, head of Moldovan think-tank Promo-LEX, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The goal of this crisis is to destabilize the Republic of Moldova and bring it under Russia&apos;s total control, and by no means to lose control over the Transnistrian region.&quot; A more likely scenario is that Russia will use the ongoing gas and electricity crisis to destabilize Moldova itself and try to bring pro-Russian parties back into power in the upcoming parliamentary elections set to be held in the second half of 2025. Chisinau has not been buying Russian gas since 2022, but Russian-occupied Transnistria continued to get its gas from Russia until Jan. 1, 2025. The halt in gas deliveries was due to Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit, including supplies to Moldova, and Moldova&apos;s debt for gas supplies. Transnistria had been effectively acquiring gas free of charge &#x2014; a political tool that Russia used to keep the region under its control. The breakaway region&apos;s debt for Russian gas amounts to more than $10 billion, according to Moldovagaz, a subsidiary of Russian gas giant Gazprom. Chisinau&apos;s separate debt for Russian gas supplies totals $709 million, according to Gazprom. However, the Moldovan government recognizes only an $8.6 million debt, citing financial audits. Gazprom said on Dec. 28 it would stop its gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1 due to its debt. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Jan. 9 blamed Ukraine and Moldova for Transnistria&apos;s gas crisis. Some 1,500 high-rise buildings in Transnistria were without heating and hot water on Jan. 4, and nearly 72,000 homes remained without gas, Transnistria&apos;s unrecognized leader Vadim Krasnoselsky said. Employees attend a security training at Moldovatransgaz&apos;s gas station in Causeni, Moldova on May 3, 2022. (Valeria Mongelli / Bloomberg via Getty Images)The end of Russian gas supplies via Ukraine has also halted all industrial activity in Transnistria, Sergey Obolonik, the first deputy chairman of Transnistria&apos;s self-proclaimed government, said on Jan. 2. Despite the crisis, Transnistria has rejected Chisinau&apos;s offer to help the region purchase gas from Europe, Vadim Cheban, CEO of Moldovagaz, said on Jan. 3. Transnistria instead expects Russia&apos;s Gazprom to resume deliveries of natural gas, Cheban said. Russia is technically capable of supplying its gas through pipelines via Turkey, Bulgaria, and Romania to Transnistria, but such supplies would have to be approved by Chisinau. The non-occupied part of Moldova has also been affected by the crisis because it had previously bought electricity from Transnistria&apos;s Cuciurgan power station, which used Russian gas as fuel. As a result of the halt in gas supplies, electricity prices in Moldova are rising. Analysts say that the crisis is likely to cause discontent in Transnistria but, due to a lack of opposition, the crisis won&apos;t have any major political consequences inside the occupied region. &quot;No matter how dissatisfied the population may be, it will not lead to an increase in opposition ratings because, in essence, there is no real opposition in Transnistria,&quot; Serhiy Gerasimchuk, a Moldova and Romania expert at the Ukrainian Prism think-tank, told the Kyiv Independent. Anatoly Dirun, a political analyst from Transnistria currently based in Chisinau, also said that &quot;there is no political opposition or alternative political forces (in the breakaway region) that could criticize the current leadership.&quot; &quot;It is difficult to speak of any potential political changes at this point,&quot; he added. The energy crisis in Transnistria prompted speculation that the Russian-controlled entity&apos;s survival is at stake and that it may be forced to reintegrate into Moldova at some point in the future. &quot;The people in Transnistria are realizing that the so-called &apos;government&apos; in Tiraspol cannot ensure basic needs like heating, gas or electricity,&quot; Eugen Muravschi, an associated expert at Chisinau-based watchdogs WatchDog MD and CPR-Moldova, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Naturally, the question will arise &#x2014; what then is the point of this regime?&quot; He argued that the &quot;situation is a big blow to the credibility and legitimacy of the Tiraspol regime, but also to the narrative of Russia as a trustworthy protector.&quot; Manole told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;in the absence of a direct corridor (linking Russia and Transnistria), the possibilities of the Russian Federation to further control and influence the Republic of Moldova through the Transnistrian region have diminished since Russia&apos;s annexation of Crimea and virtually disappeared with the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.&quot; Women pose by decorations in Russian flag colors on Republic Day in Tiraspol, Transnistria, Moldova on Sept. 2, 2023. (Peter Dench / Getty Images)Despite that, analysts argue that Transnistria&apos;s reintegration into Moldova is unlikely. &quot;Questions related to reintegration are currently out of focus. In the short term, the crisis is unlikely to trigger any political change,&quot; Victoria Nemerenco, a program coordinator at Moldova&apos;s Institute for European Policies and Reforms, told the Kyiv Independent. Manole also said that Moldova is not ready &quot;to reintegrate Transnistria, because in the last 2-3 years Russia has taken care to reactivate another source of instability in the south of the Republic of Moldova (Gagauzia), while there are numerous groups in the country that openly support the Russian Federation and its efforts to occupy Ukraine and implicitly later the Republic of Moldova.&quot; The pro-Western government may be reluctant to reintegrate Transnistria because it would dramatically increase the share of pro-Russian voters in elections. &quot;In theory, these are suitable circumstances for kicking off the reintegration process,&quot; Muravschi said. &quot;The problem is that the authorities in Chisinau do not seem to have a plan in this regard &#x2014; they seem preoccupied only with managing the crisis, not turning it into an opportunity. In short, this crisis is shaking the Tiraspol regime, but it will not necessarily topple it without more initiative and assertiveness from the Moldovan government.&quot; Dirun also said that &quot;there are discussions among colleagues in Chisinau that this could lead to the collapse of (Transnistria), but this will not happen.&quot; One reason why Moldova&apos;s reintegration is unlikely is that it may lead to a Russian economic or even military attack. However, Russia will also face difficulties if it decides to launch an actual military operation. Jamie Shea, a defense and security analyst at Chatham House, told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;Russia is today fully engaged in eastern Ukraine and in trying to push Ukrainian forces out of the Kursk Oblast.&quot; &quot;So it would probably have to halt its operations at least for a period in order to invade and subsequently occupy Moldova, although this country is much smaller and with far less defensive capacity than Ukraine,&quot; he added. He also said that Russian troops currently deployed in Transnistria &quot;are not trained and equipped for offensive operations and would not be able to move against the rest of Moldova without significant reinforcements.&quot; Moldovan army recruits take a break at their camp in Bulboaca, Moldova, May 16, 2024.

A major obstacle to EU accession, however, will be resolving the conflict with its breakaway Transnistria region, which has had a Russian military presence since 1992. (Will Baxter/Getty Images)Russia has a mere 1,700 troops in Transnistria, while Transnistria&apos;s army comprises about 7,500 troops. It would also be difficult for Russia to move troops to Moldova because it does not control any Ukrainian areas adjacent to the country, such as Odesa Oblast. &quot;Russia would also need to transport troops by air, and the transport planes could easily be shot down by Ukraine&apos;s air defense or over the Black Sea,&quot; Shea said. &quot;It would be a dangerous undertaking to move Russian ground forces and aircraft across Ukrainian territory in a wartime situation.&quot; He added that, instead of a direct invasion, Russia might &quot;use pro-Russian groups inside Moldova and Transnistria to destabilize the country and organize violence and disturbances.&quot; Muravschi also said that &quot;as long as Russia does not advance on the southern front in Ukraine and obtain a land bridge towards Transnistria, it would be very difficult for them to mount a military operation against Moldova.&quot; Analysts argue that, rather than using military force, Russia is more likely to use the gas and electricity crisis in Moldova to destabilize the political situation in the republic and help pro-Kremlin groups win the upcoming parliamentary election, which must be held in the second half of 2025. Moldovan authorities, independent observers, and officials from the EU and the U.S. have pointed to a malign influence campaign involving criminal networks and political groups tied to Russia. Moldovan lawmakers claimed that Moscow had spent millions of dollars to fund Alexandr Stoianoglo, a pro-Russian candidate who lost to pro-Western President Maia Sandu in the Nov. 3 presidential election. Simultaneously with the election, Moldova held a referendum on adding the country&apos;s aspiration to join the EU to its constitution, with 50.35% of the voters supporting the move and 49.65% voting against it. A majority of voters living in Moldova voted against Sandu and amending the constitution, and the narrow victories were achieved due to the support of Moldovans living abroad, who account for nearly 15% of all registered voters. &quot;Why would Moscow need (a military operation) now, if it can achieve an electoral victory and have Moldova fall into the Kremlin&apos;s hands?&quot; Gerasimchuk said.

(Daniel Mihailescu / AFP via Getty Images)He also said that Russia may &quot;choose a candidate capable of negotiating with Gazprom to restore gas supplies.&quot; &quot;Naturally, with promises of this kind, reinforced by unambiguous signals from Moscow, any politician or political force could gain the support of the socially vulnerable population and thus improve their results in the parliamentary elections,&quot; Gerasimchuk added. &quot;In such conditions, Moldova risks descending into governance chaos, where a weakened president will rely on an unstable parliament, which could lead to a prolonged socio-economic crisis,&quot; he added. &quot;In this situation, European integration will be off the table.&quot; Muravschi said that &quot;pro-Russian parties are claiming that this crisis is the result of the government&apos;s &apos;Russophobia&apos; and &quot;promise a secure supply of cheap energy from Russia if they come to power.&quot; He added that &quot;the popularity of the ruling pro-European party has been eroding for years now and the energy crisis is not helping them.&quot; &quot;At the moment, it seems impossible for Maia Sandu&apos;s party to retain a parliamentary majority by themselves at the next election,&quot; Muravschi said. &quot;Russia&apos;s goal is clearly to destabilize the situation in Moldova, undermine the government, and help pro-Russian parties win the parliamentary election.&quot; Nemerenco also said that &quot;energy dependence has historically been one of Russia&apos;s key tools for exerting pressure, and the current crisis offers Moscow an opportunity to exploit Moldova&apos;s vulnerabilities.&quot; &quot;Rising energy prices and supply insecurity could directly affect household incomes and living standards, increasing public frustration; and the president, as well as the pro-European government, could thus become vulnerable to blame, even if the crisis stems from external factors,&quot; she said.	https://kyivindependent.com/will-transnistrias-gas-crisis-lead-to-its-collapse-and-reintegration-into-moldova/	2025-01-14T04:02:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-2043797379.jpg
65 oil tankers drop anchor after latest US sanctions against Russia, Reuters reports	Sixty-five oil tankers paused operations in various places around the world following the recent U.S.-U.K. sanctions against Russia&#x2019;s oil industry and shadow fleet, Reuters reported on Jan. 13, citing maritime tracking data. According to the news agency, five of those tankers were anchoring off China and Singapore, while others were idling in the Baltic Sea and near Russia&apos;s Far East. The latest sanctions targeted more than 180 oil-carrying vessels of Russia&apos;s so-called shadow fleet, a group of aging tankers routinely used for sanction evasion. Several of these vessels are also reportedly involved in transporting sanctioned Iranian oil. Experts cited by Reuters said the latest measures drove up prices of tankers as demand for non-sanctioned vessels grew. The recent sanctions also targeted two of Russia&apos;s major oil producers, Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegaz, along with dozens of their subsidiaries. Combined, these companies reportedly produce over 1 million barrels of oil daily, generating an estimated $23 billion of revenue annually, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The sanctions also extend to dozens of Russian energy officials and corporate executives, further tightening restrictions on Moscow&apos;s oil industry.	https://kyivindependent.com/65-oil-tankers-drop-anchor-after-latest-us-sanctions-against-russia-reuters-reports/	2025-01-14T03:00:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1822474446.jpg
European allies grow optimistic about Trump not abandoning Ukraine, Bloomberg reports	Kyiv&apos;s European partners are growing optimistic that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will not pressure Ukraine into accepting a painful peace deal, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 14, citing undisclosed European officials. Following closed-door talks with Trump&apos;s team, the officials see a rising chance that the new U.S. leadership will seek to help Ukraine negotiate from the position of strength, the outlet wrote. Trump, returning to the White House on Jan. 20, initially caused concern among the pro-Kyiv coalition by his declared sympathies for Russian President Vladimir Putin and criticism of the Biden administration&apos;s military support for Ukraine. The president-elect has reportedly proved more flexible on the matter than expected. His team is particularly receptive to arguments about Russia&apos;s victory emboldening China and dealing the U.S. a humiliation similar to the Taliban&apos;s victory in Afghanistan in 2021, according to Bloomberg&apos;s sources. Trump has pledged to bring a swift end to the war but provided few details on how he plans to achieve this. A pitch leaked from his team &#x2014; freezing the front lines, postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2014; has already been rejected by Russia. There were other signals that Trump does not intend to cut the support for Ukraine completely as part of his plan to resolve the war. Speaking to the Time magazine, the president-elect said he would not &quot;abandon&quot; the besieged country, though criticizing the Biden administration for permitting long-range strikes on Russian soil. According to the Financial Times, Trump told the Europan allies he plans to continue supporting Ukraine while asking them to raise their defense spending levels to 5% of GDP. This echoes Trump&apos;s earlier appeals to Europe to take up greater responsibility both for Ukraine&apos;s defense and for their own security.	https://kyivindependent.com/european-allies-grow-optimistic-about-trump-not-abandoning-ukraine-bloomberg-reports/	2025-01-14T02:40:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/2024-12-10-19_27_27.jpg
Ukraine targets Russia's Engels airbase in 'multi-day, comprehensive operation,' drone forces report	Ukraine has targeted Russia&apos;s Engels airbase in a &quot;multi-day, comprehensive operation,&quot; Kyiv&apos;s 14th Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Regiment reported on Jan. 14. In a post on Facebook, the regiment &#x2014; part of Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces &#x2014; said the attacks were to &quot;reduce the enemy&apos;s strategic aviation capabilities,&quot; and had struck aviation fuel tanks used to supply Russian long-range bomber aircraft. &quot;We are doing our best to ensure that Engels fire crews, who have just put out the flames after the previous attack, are not left without work in the face of the increasingly difficult economic situation in Russia,&quot; it said. Earlier on Jan. 14, Russian local authorities reported an overnight drone attack had damaged an industrial facility in the city of Engels, located in Russia&apos;s Saratov Oblast, following a previous attack overnight on Jan. 8 which targeted the Kristal Plant used to supply fuel to Engels. They released no further details of what was hit on Jan. 14, but the 14th Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Regiment later claimed it had &quot;struck the infrastructure of (Engels airbase).&quot; It did not specify what type of weapon was used in the attack. A source in Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) later on Jan. 14 told the Kyiv Independent the attack had struck ammunition warehouses at the airbase storing cruise missiles and glide bombs. The SBU source added it was part of a wider operation overnight that targeted several sites across Russia, including the Aleksinsky Chemical Plant in Tula Oblast, the Saratov oil refinery, and the Bryansk chemical plant. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. Several explosions were heard in the area, according to local reports from Russian Telegram channels. Located in the Saratov Oblast, over 750 kilometers from the Ukrainian border, Engels airbase &#x2013; also known as Engels-2 &#x2013; is home to the 184th Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment and 121st Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment. It was built in 1952 and has been in service since 1954. Engels is home to three types of Russian strategic bombers &#x2013; the Tupolev Tu-95, the Tupolev Tu-22, and the Tupolev Tu-160, all regularly used to launch missiles at Ukrainian cities. The Tu-95 is the older of the three aircraft, a Soviet-era plane that made its first flight in 1952. It was originally used to carry nuclear bombs but has since evolved to launch cruise missiles. Satellite imagery from Dec 3 &amp; 4, 2022, of Engels airbase, Russia (before reports of explosions at the base), showing recent military activity at &amp; near the airfield which houses a heavy bomber aviation unit, primarily comprised of Tu-95 (Bear) &amp; Tu-60 (Blackjack) bombers. (Maxar Technologies/Twitter)Each aircraft can carry 16 cruise missiles &#x2013; either the Kh-55/Kh-555 or the newer Kh-101 and Kh-102 air-launched cruise missiles. It features turboprop propellers rather than jet engines, as during the Cold War, their increased efficiency allowed it to fly all the way to the United States without refueling. The Tu-22 carries the Kh-22 missiles, which poses a particular problem for Ukraine. It is supersonic and travels at around 4,000 kilometers per hour. Currently, the missile can only be shot down with the U.S.-made Patriot air defense system and potentially the SAMP-T, a joint Italian-French system. The Tu-160 is Russia&apos;s more modern strategic bomber, entering service in 1987. To this day, it remains the largest operational bomber in the world. It can carry a total of 12 Kh-55 missiles and up to 24 Kh-15s. Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces were established to improve Ukraine&apos;s work with drones, form special drone-specific units, and improve the production, training, and innovation of unmanned vehicles. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks throughout the full-scale with Russia. The Ukrainian military has proven to be a pioneer in drone technology, using innovative ways to undermine Russia&apos;s material and numerical advantage. Aerial drones have been used to ram into Russian helicopters or drop molten metal on ground positions, while naval drones were a key component in upending Russia&apos;s dominance in the Black Sea. In turn, Russia has also widely deployed drone capabilities during the full-scale invasion, both on the battlefield and to attack Ukrainian cities and infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-targets-russias-engels-airbase-in-multi-day-comprehensive-operation-drone-forces-report/	2025-01-14T02:39:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/FjOqRPzUYAwG8-F.jpeg
NATO chief says alliance either raises defense spending or can begin taking 'Russian language courses'	NATO should raise its current 2% of GDP defense spending goal, or the allies can begin taking &quot;Russian language courses or move to New Zealand,&quot; Secretary General Mark Rutte jokingly told the European Parliament on Jan. 13. Voices calling for higher defense spending across NATO grew louder after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. &quot;Everything I&apos;m seeing at this moment is not nearly enough, and if we don&apos;t do it (raise the spending targets) we are safe now but not in four or five years. So if you don&apos;t do it, get out your Russian language courses or go to New Zealand,&quot; Rutte said. &quot;Or decide now to spend more, and that&apos;s exactly the debate we have to finalize over the next three or four months, to stay safe in this part of the world.&quot; The secretary general did not specify a new target number during his address. On Dec. 12, the Financial Times reported that European NATO foreign ministers began discussing a plan to gradually increase the alliance&#x2019;s defense spending target from 2% of their GDP to 3% by 2030. According to the outlet&apos;s sources, the alliance&#x2019;s members would first increase their spending to 2.5% of GDP before reaching 3% by the start of the next decade. Incoming U.S. President Donald Trump called for an even more radical increase, up to 5% of GDP. Trump has criticized NATO member states that do not meet the current 2% of GDP spending target. Several NATO allies, including Italy, Canada, and Spain, do not meet the current target, though the number of allies that do rose to 24 in 2024. According to NATO estimates, Poland spent the greatest portion of its GDP on defense (4.12%) in 2024, followed by Estonia (3.43%) and the U.S. (3.38%). In the face of Russia&apos;s war, Ukraine has drastically increased defense spending.

Fico will not visit Kyiv, Slovak lawmaker says	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico will not visit Kyiv to discuss the halting of Russian gas transit through Ukraine, Tibor Gaspar, deputy-speaker of the Slovak Parliament told Russian state-controlled news agency TASS on Jan. 14 during a visit in Moscow. A day earlier, Fico had proposed in an open letter a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Slovakia to discuss the gas transit issue. In a response posted on social media, Zelensky agreed to the meeting but insisted Fico &quot;come to Kyiv on Friday.&quot; &#x201C;Yesterday, Prime Minister Fico published an open letter for Zelensky and invited him for talks. Zelensky replied that it was necessary to come to Kyiv on Friday. It&apos;s not possible. I think it will not happen,&#x201D; Gaspar said. The development is the latest in an escalating conflict between Ukraine and Slovakia over Kyiv&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit. While the EU has made efforts to reduce dependency on Russian fossil fuels following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many countries, including Slovakia and Hungary, remain reliant on Russian gas. Fico estimated Slovakia&apos;s alleged losses from stopping Russian gas supplies via Ukraine at 500 million euros ($510 million) per year. Fico has threatened to cut off electricity supplies to Ukraine amid increasing blackouts due to Russian attacks targeting Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure, and also threatened to limit aid to Ukrainian refugees in Slovakia. Zelensky previously said that Ukraine had offered Slovakia assistance for the adaptation period, but &quot;Fico arrogantly refused.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/fico-will-not-visit-kyiv-slovakian-lawmaker-says/	2025-01-14T01:48:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192475502.jpg

Trump wants to meet Putin 'very quickly' after inauguration	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Jan. 13 that he plans to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;very quickly,&quot; adding that the Russian leader &quot;wants to meet&quot; as well. The incoming U.S. president echoed his previous comments on his intent to meet the Russian leader and hammer out a deal to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war, which nears its third anniversary. Trump initially declared during his presidential campaign he would end the war within 24 hours, though he recently extended this timeline to up to six months. Talking to Newsmax, Trump said that Putin wants to meet as the war &quot;hasn&apos;t gone so well for him either.&quot; &quot;I know he wants to meet, and I&apos;m gonna meet (him) very quickly,&quot; the president-elect said, adding that the meeting has to take place after his inauguration. Trump also noted that Ukraine is &quot;being decimated&quot; while both Russian and Ukrainian soldiers &quot;are being killed in large numbers.&quot; The Kremlin has already signaled Putin&apos;s willingness to meet Trump after he takes office, though no firm date has been set. Switzerland and Serbia said they are open to hosting an in-person meeting between the two leaders. According to Trump&apos;s incoming national security advisor, Mike Waltz, the president-elect and Putin are also expected to hold a telephone call &quot;in the coming days and weeks.&quot; Trump has often voiced sympathies for the Russian leader while criticizing the level of support the outgoing Biden administration threw behind Kyiv. This prompted concerns that the new U.S. leadership might cut a deal unfavorable to Ukraine. &#xA0; Trump&apos;s incoming peace envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said that the president-elect&apos;s aim is not to &quot;give something to Putin or the Russians&quot; but to &quot;save Ukraine and save their sovereignty.&quot; Trump said that specific peace proposals are still being worked out. A pitch leaked from his team &#x2014; freezing the front lines, postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2014; has already been rejected by Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-wants-to-meet-putin-very-quickly-after-inauguration/	2025-01-13T23:13:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192846806.jpg

Oil tanker crew planned more cable sabotage before capture, Finland says	Finnish investigators say the crew of an oil tanker accused of damaging undersea power and communication cables in the Baltic Sea were preparing to cut additional infrastructure before authorities intervened, according to Reuters. Last month, Finnish authorities boarded an oil tanker Eagle S, allegedly part of Moscow&#x2019;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet.&quot; Since Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Baltic Sea region has faced numerous disruptions to power cables, telecom links, and gas pipelines. NATO member states surrounding the Baltic Sea are scheduled to meet in Helsinki on Jan. 14 to discuss collective measures against such threats. The Eagle S allegedly caused damage to the Estlink 2 power line and four telecommunications cables between Finland and Estonia by dragging its anchor over 100 kilometers along the seabed. Risto Lohi, head of the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation, said the ship was also at risk of damaging the Estlink 1 power line and the BalticConnector gas pipeline when authorities took action. &quot;There would have been an almost immediate danger that other cables or pipes related to our critical underwater infrastructure could have been damaged,&quot; Lohi said. Authorities are investigating nine of the ship&#x2019;s crew members, including the Georgian captain and sailors from India and Georgia. In a separate incident, Baltic Sea nations suspect the Chinese bulk carrier Yi Peng 3 of dragging its anchor to sever two undersea fiber-optic cables in November. Sweden&apos;s Civil Defense Minister, Carl-Oskar Bohlin, stated that evidence of anchor damage linked to the Yi Peng 3 was also found near the NordBalt power cable, which connects Sweden and Lithuania. &quot;This obviously illustrates the seriousness of the situation we find ourselves in,&quot; Bohlin reprotedly said.	https://kyivindependent.com/oil-tanker-crew-planned-more-cable-sabotage-before-capture-finland-says/	2025-01-13T19:38:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167101990.jpg

Putin has failed to meet any of his strategic objectives in Ukraine, Biden says	Russian President Vladimir Putin has failed to meet any of his strategic objectives in Ukraine, U.S. President Joe Biden said at a foreign policy address on Jan. 13. Biden&apos;s remarks come as his term as president comes to an end and Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine nears its third year. Biden reflected on his foreign policy record, including his role in Ukraine&apos;s fight against Russia, one week before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office on Jan. 20. The president defending his administration&apos;s policies and said they prevented Putin from reaching his goals. &quot;When Putin invaded Ukraine, he thought he&apos;d conquer Kyiv in a matter of days,&quot; Biden said. &quot;The truth is, since that war began I&apos;m the only one that stood in the center of Kyiv, not him, Putin never has.&quot; Biden visited Kyiv in February 2023, becoming the only U.S. commander-in-chief to visit a war zone not controlled by U.S. forces. &quot;Putin has failed to achieve any of his strategic objectives,&quot; Biden said. &quot;He has failed thus far to subjugate Ukraine, failed to break the unity of NATO, and failed to make large territorial gains. There is more to do, we can&apos;t walk away.&quot; Biden praised Washington&apos;s coalition-building and readiness to provide military aid, saying the U.S. brought together 50 nations to stand with Ukraine and delivered &quot;massive numbers of munitions&quot; and other crucial assistance to Kyiv. The address also touched on the effectiveness of U.S. sanctions in weakening Russia&apos;s economy. The U.S. has &quot;enacted relentless unprecedented sanctions to keep Ukraine in the fight ... Russia is struggling to replace what they are losing on the battlefield in terms of military equipment and fighters and the ruble is under enormous pressure,&quot; Biden said. Biden echoed earlier remarks by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who said on Jan. 12 that the White House was preparing a strong Ukraine policy foundation to hand off to the incoming Trump administration. &quot;(W)e laid the foundation for the next administration so they can protect the bright future of the Ukrainian people,&quot; Biden said. Trump has previously criticized U.S. military support for Ukraine and promised to negotiate an end to the war. He is reportedly in the process of planning an in-person meeting with Putin, set to take place at an unspecified time after his inauguration. Biden has urged the U.S. congress to continue sending aid to Ukraine even if Trump is opposed to further assistance. In a speech on Jan. 10, Biden said he did everything he could to help Ukraine during his time in office.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-and-allies-cant-walk-away-from-ukraine-biden-says/	2025-01-13T14:32:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Biden.png
Zelensky announces new sanctions on Russian financial sector	President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree on Jan. 13 imposing new sanctions on the Russian financial sector. Since the launch of full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine has been expanding its list of sanctions against individuals and enterprises that support Russia&apos;s war. The sanctions target 140 distinct entitites, Zelensky said in his evening address. Along with the decree, the president also signed a draft law introducing criminal penalties for attempts to evade sanctions. The proposed law is based on international standards for enforcing sanctions. &quot;We all understand that the more pressure we exert on the aggressor, the closer we bring peace,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Sanctions are one of the most effective tools for justly pressuring Russia and everyone associated with it or working for the war.&quot; The draft law will be next be submitted to the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s parliament. Days before Zelensky&apos;s announcement, the United States and United Kingdom imposed broad sanctions against the Russian oil industry, taking aim at Moscow&apos;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet.&quot; The restrictions targeted nearly 200 vessels, along with Russian oil companies and industry officials.

Bryansk chemical plant hit in aerial attack, Russian media says	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A chemical plant in Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast was allegedly damaged in an aerial attack on the night of Jan. 13, Russian media reported. Regional Governor Alexander Bogomaz reported that Russian air defense units were repelling a drone attack over Bryansk Oblast. Later in the evening, the Astra Telegram news channel reported that the Bryansk chemical plant had been hit &#x2014;&#xA0;possibly by a long-range ATACMS missile &#x2014; and posted footage showing explosions at the site. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The Bryansk chemical plant produces gunpowder and explosives, according to Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s counter-disinformation center. &quot;It is important for the production of artillery ammunition and missiles for the Russian army,&quot; Kovalenko said in a Telegram post after the alleged attack. &quot;This enterprise is one of the key elements of the Russian military industry.&quot; The plant was reportedly damaged in a previous attack in November. Kovalenko also said on Jan. 13 that explosions had occurred at the &quot;Kremniy El&quot; microelectronics plant &#xA0;in Bryansk, though Russian sources have not reported an attack on that site and the Kyiv Independent could not verify the claim. &quot;Kremniy El&quot; was previously targeted in attacks in October 2024 and August 2023. &#xA0; The plant produces components widely used in Russian defense production, including for Pantsir air defense systems and Iskander missile systems.	https://kyivindependent.com/bryansk-chemical-plant-hit-in-aerial-attack-russian-media-says/	2025-01-13T12:52:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1247635468.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia claims to occupy 2 more villages in Ukraine's east; Kyiv doesn't confirm	Key developments on Jan. 13: Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 12 that its forces had captured the villages of Yantarne in Donetsk Oblast and Kalynove in Kharkiv Oblast. Ukraine has not commented on the claims. The Russian statement could not be immediately verified. Moscow&apos;s forces have ramped up pressure in Ukraine&apos;s east as Ukrainian forces find themselves increasingly outnumbered and outgunned. Yantarne lies around 10 kilometers (6 miles) southeast of the town of Kurakhove, almost completely overrun by Russian forces. The Ukrainian military recently claimed it continues to hold positions at the Kurakhove Thermal Power Plant. Russian propagandist Vladimir Solovyov on Jan. 10 shared footage showing Russian soldiers raising flags over damaged buildings, claiming to be located in Yantarne. The estimated Russian advance in the Kurakhove sector in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 12, 2025, according to DeepState. Yantarne marked by a black symbol. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)The Ukrainian war monitoring website DeepState said that the situation in the village is still being clarified without confirming nor denying the loss of Yantarne, while Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces reported engagements in the area on Jan. 12. The northeastern village of Kalynove lies on the west bank of the Oskil River and north of Kupiansk, a key logistical hub liberated by Ukraine during a counteroffensive in the fall of 2022. Russian forces have been attempting to force the Oskil River for months in an attempt to outflank Ukrainian troops. Andrii Besedin, head of the Kupiansk military administration, said on Jan. 9 that Moscow&apos;s troops are trying to secure a bridgehead in the town of Dvorichna on the river&apos;s Ukraine-held western bank. Besedin also said that Russian forces are now within 2 kilometers (1.5 miles) of Kupiansk&apos;s outskirts, adding that the situation is &quot;very difficult.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces repelled an assault by North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the unit&apos;s press service said on Jan. 13, claiming to have killed 17 North Korean soldiers. North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched on Aug. 6. Ukrainian troops have continued fighting in the region, leveraging their positions for potential future negotiations. The battle, the date of which remains undisclosed, lasted from morning until night. The unit released a video of the engagement, showing what are said to be dead North Korean soldiers. A Ukrainian group encountered one surviving North Korean fighter who had set an unsuccessful trap. The soldier attempted to mislead the Ukrainian troops and then detonated a grenade to avoid capture, fatally injuring himself, according to the Special Operations Forces. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) claimed that North Korean casualties have already reached 300 soldiers killed and 2,700 wounded. The NIS attributed the casualties to their lack of modern warfare training, including ineffective efforts to combat long-range drones. The NIS further alleged that North Korean soldiers had been forced to commit suicide to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces, a claim echoed by White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby on Dec. 27. Kirby said that captured North Korean troops fear their families would face severe retaliation if they surrendered. On Jan. 11, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the capture of two North Korean soldiers in Kursk Oblast. The prisoners of war (POWs), identified by the NIS as members of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea&apos;s military intelligence agency, are in Ukrainian custody and receiving medical treatment. Ukraine&apos;s government has approved a measure allowing foreign companies to participate in modernizing military equipment for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the Defense Ministry announced on Jan. 13. The initiative focuses on upgrading state aviation aircraft, ships, and their components using advanced Western technologies. The decision aims to foster joint high-tech projects with international partners while adhering to global standards and ensuring transparent cooperation. This move also aligns with Ukraine&apos;s push to expand its defense production capabilities amid the ongoing war with Russia. Foreign firms with special permits for transferring military technology and exporting defense-related goods and services will now be eligible to collaborate, according to Deputy Defense Minister Brigadier General Anatolii Klochko. &quot;Modernizing outdated equipment will significantly enhance its efficiency, leveraging high-tech solutions from foreign partners,&quot; Klochko said. Ukraine allocated Hr 55 billion ($1.3 billion) for weapons production in its 2025 budget, Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin announced on Nov. 12, 2024. Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has actively sought to modernize its defense infrastructure, with an emphasis on integrating Western technologies to bolster its military efficiency and resilience. Germany delivered the first batch of the promised 54 RCH 155 self-propelled howitzers, the country&apos;s Foreign Minister Boris Pistorius said during a news conference on Jan. 13. Six out of the 54 howitzers will remain in Germany to train Ukrainian personnel. &quot;Ukraine can count on us, and this (the delivery) is a signal. And Germany is ready to take responsibility in Europe,&quot; Pistorius was quoted as saying in the German city of Kassel, where the howitzers are manufactured. Ukraine&apos;s Ambassador to Germany, Oleksii Makeiev, symbolically accepted the first batch on site. Ukraine had requested the RCH 155 in July 2022. The RCH-155 self-propelled howitzer is a new combination of a GTK Boxer APC (armored personnel carrier) with an automated artillery turret of the PzH &#x200B;&#x200B;2000. It fires 155 mm shells to a distance of up to 54 kilometers. It can move quickly on or off-road at speeds of over 100 kilometers per hour due to the wheeled base similar to a heavy-duty armored vehicle. Ukraine is the first country to receive the new RCH 155. The U.K. will finance the production of air defense systems and long-range weapons in Ukraine, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Jan. 13 following a meeting with U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey in London. &quot;The U.K. has already invested in the production of our weapons, and this collaboration continues &#x2014; specifically, funding will be directed toward the production of air defense systems and long-range weapons,&quot; Umerov wrote on Facebook. Umerov met with Healey to discuss bilateral cooperation in 2025 in key security areas. &quot;The U.K. reaffirmed its commitment to providing continuous and comprehensive support to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s position both on the battlefield and on the international stage,&quot; the minister said. &quot;We anticipate enhanced military, political, and economic assistance from our British allies this year.&quot; Umerov did not provide further details on how London would finance Ukrainian defense industry. In 2025, Ukraine plans to spend a record $35 billion on arms production, of which $17 billion will be financed by the Ukrainian government, according to Umerov. The rest may be supported by allies, he added. Kyiv has ramped up domestic drone production over the past year, as well as the development of new missiles. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks throughout the full-scale war with Russia. Ukraine, in recent months, has championed the development of long-range &quot;missile-drones,&quot; upgraded UAVs with turbojet engines that can act as alternatives to cruise missiles. Kyiv unveiled its Palianytsia and Peklo hybrids in the second half of 2024. Zelensky has said Ukraine aims to produce at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025 and conducted the first successful test of a new Ukrainian missile, dubbed Ruta (Rue).	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-claims-to-occupy-2-more-villages-in-ukraines-east-kyiv-hasnt-confirmed/	2025-01-13T12:32:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192142681.jpg
Ukraine’s new Kursk push brings minor gains, raising concerns over limited resources	Since the new push in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast in early January, Ukraine has made small gains and managed to capture the first North Korean prisoners of war in the area but experts have raised concerns about Kyiv&#x2019;s use of limited resources while fierce battles rage elsewhere. The assessment comes as more &#x2013; but still limited &#x2013; open-source data emerges from the week-old Ukrainian operation around the village of Berdin in what experts believe was Kyiv&#x2019;s tactic to take advantage of a weakened Russian defense in the area. The Ukrainian military has so far remained silent on the operation, though reporting on Jan. 5 that the most intense fighting across the front line was happening in Kursk Oblast. Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the Center for Countering Disinformation (CCD) in the National Security and Defense Council, told the Kyiv Independent that Ukrainian forces had advanced over two kilometers in Kursk Oblast on the first day. He declined to comment further on operational details. In a Jan. 5 Telegram post, Kovalenko said that the Ukrainian attacks in several directions in Kursk Oblast &quot;came as a surprise&quot; for the Russian troops. Andrii Yermak, the head of the President&#x2019;s Office, praised the &#x201C;good news&#x201D; from the southwestern Russian region where Ukraine is gripping onto a narrow patch of territory at high costs, saying that &#x201C;Russia is getting what it deserves.&#x201D; Western and Ukrainian military experts warned that the scale and success of the costly Ukrainian operation were &#x201C;exaggerated,&#x201D; with Kyiv achieving minor tactical gains &#x2013; at least some of which Russia appears to have reclaimed quickly. The new Ukrainian attacks came five months after Kyiv launched its cross-border incursion into Russia in August 2024, surprising Western leaders and temporarily boosting the morale among the exhausted troops elsewhere withdrawing little by little. Some of Ukraine&#x2019;s most elite units, along with the less experienced ones, took part in the operation. However, months into the incursion, more Ukrainian soldiers have increasingly grown pessimistic toward what they believe would be a short-lived operation, with many questioning the cost of invading another country&#x2019;s territory when the defense of one&#x2019;s own is at stake. Since August, Ukraine has reportedly lost more than half of the Kursk Oblast territories it captured. Meanwhile, Russia has advanced at its quickest pace since early 2022, and the stretched-out Ukrainian troops have lost important long-time strongholds, including Vuhledar, Selydove, and, most recently, Kurakhove in the eastern Donetsk Oblast.

(Yevhenii Vasyliev/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)The Kursk incursion rages on as unpredictable U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has recently said he hopes to end the war in Ukraine in about half a year, is due to take office on Jan. 20. It is widely believed that Ukraine&#x2019;s control of Russian territory could be a bargaining chip at the possible future negotiations with Russia. Outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters in Seoul on Jan. 6 that Ukraine&#x2019;s small patch of Kursk Oblast &#x201C;is an important one because certainly it&apos;s something that would factor in any negotiation that may come about in the coming year.&#x201D; Ukraine&#x2019;s recent attacks against Russian positions in Kursk Oblast are &#x201C;very limited&#x201D; due to severe manpower and resource shortages, Ivan Stupak, a Ukrainian military commentator and former Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) officer, said. Estimating the push to involve from hundreds to 2,000 Ukrainian troops at most and dozens of heavy equipment, Stupak said that the renewed operation appears to be 70% for political purposes and 30% for military purposes. The operation appears to be Kyiv&#x2019;s attempt to inflict &#x201C;pain&#x201D; one more time on Russia and provide Ukrainians with &#x201C;a bit more victories&#x201D; in the tough time when the front-line situation continues to deteriorate, according to the expert. He added that it may also be to relieve the situation across hot spots of the war in Ukraine, such as in the Donbas, by trying to force Russia to deploy more troops to the Kursk axis, as well as to possibly disrupt Moscow&#x2019;s tactical plans in the area. &#x201C;I expect that it will be maybe a couple of weeks of offensive operation but within Kursk Oblast,&#x201D; Stupak told the Kyiv Independent. Ukraine currently controls about 450 kilometers of Kursk Oblast territory, which is roughly the size of Detroit, according to Stupak. Ukraine managed to break through the Russian defenses in some villages in the Berdin area, but it appears Ukrainians have already been pushed out of some, Emil Kastehelmi, an analyst at the Black Bird Group analyzing the war closely through open source, said. Advancing anywhere in Kursk Oblast is now difficult due to the high concentration of Russia&#x2019;s troops and its heavy use of first-person view (FPV) drones and glide bombs, according to experts. &#x201C;It is pretty clear that the Ukrainians don&apos;t have any more capabilities to rapidly advance in this area anymore,&#x201D; Kastehelmi told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;So it&apos;s more of these localized counterattacks and then just staying on the defense instead of a new offensive phase.&#x201D; Ukraine may have tried to seize the moment when there was a low number or quality of Russian soldiers deployed at this particular point, a shortage of heavy equipment in the area, or the rotation of units, according to experts. &#x201C;Currently, it seems that the Russians were able to counter some of the Ukrainian advances and then strike back,&#x201D; Kastehelmi said. The operation appears to have gained tactical gains but &quot;nothing that would change the general dynamics of the battlefield,&#x201D; he added. Spending forces to take &quot;some small, very local successes in the furthest corner of the (Kursk) salient&quot; when Ukraine is struggling to hold onto its remaining captured territories amid the serious manpower issue could be &quot;net negative,&quot; Kastehelmi suggested. Russian troops have been pushing from the flanks, particularly toward the town of Sudzha and from the western direction of the salient, so trying to advance further toward the corners without expanding the flanks may compromise Ukrainian defense, according to Kastehelmi. Yaroslav, a serviceman in the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces sabotage and reconnaissance group deployed in Kursk Oblast, agreed with Kastehelmi&#x2019;s assessment. The soldier is only identified by first name in accordance with the security protocols of the Ukrainian military. Yaroslav stressed that the situation around the strategic town of Sudzha is difficult, with Russian troops continuing to push in the areas of villages to its north and south &#x2013; Malaya Loknya and Makhovka. &#x201C;Instead of expanding our flanks, we are drilling into the enemy&apos;s depths,&#x201D; Yaroslav told the Kyiv Independent.

(Serhiy Morgunov/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)Holding onto Sudzha is crucial for Kyiv. With the only one main road used to support Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast from the adjacent Sumy Oblast in northeastern Ukraine, losing the town could jeopardize Ukrainian logistics crucial for the operation, according to Ukrainian expert Stupak. &#x201C;If Russians will manage to cut this road, it will be very difficult to supply Ukrainians with everything &#x2013; with medicine, manpower, heavy equipment, shells, etc.,&#x201D; he said. The overall Russian offensive &#x2013; supported by North Korean soldiers &#x2013; continues in Kursk Oblast despite the local Ukrainian attacks on the corner of the salient, making it extremely difficult for the Ukrainians to hold the ground. About 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast, a senior Ukrainian official familiar with the intelligence told the Kyiv Independent in December. Stupak also argued that gaining territory is just one side of the medal, the other one is holding it. &#x201C;It&apos;s a big question because we are using the best of the best soldiers in this land and of the best supplied Western equipment and lots of other directions, such as Donetsk or Zaporizhzhia oblasts, they are suffering from a shortage of shells, manpower, equipped and motivated detachments.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-new-kursk-push-brings-minor-gains-concerns-rise-over-use-of-limited-resources/	2025-01-13T12:20:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166951505.jpg
Everything we know about the North Korean POWs captured by Ukraine	Ukrainian forces fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast captured two North Korean soldiers, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Jan. 11, &quot;irrefutable evidence&quot; of Pyongyang&apos;s involvement in Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion. &quot;This task was not easy,&quot; Zelensky said, claiming that North Korean military personnel usually &quot;finish off their wounded&quot; in order to hide the evidence of their participation in the war. North Korea deployed around 12,000 soldiers in Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion in August 2024 to bring the war to Russia, a senior Ukrainian official familiar with the intelligence told the Kyiv Independent in December 2024. Ukrainian forces captured a wounded North Korean soldier during operations in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Yonhap reported on Dec. 27, citing the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS), though he later reportedly died of his wounds. Since Zelensky&apos;s announcement on Jan. 11, a few details about the POWs have emerged, as well as questions about what could happen to them next. &quot;I know it&apos;s seen as a bit of a propaganda coup, but in the big scheme of things, I think it&apos;s of minimal significance,&quot; retired Australian Major General Mick Ryan told the Kyiv independent. Despite the capture of two North Korean POWs fighting for Russia being the first of its kind, Ryan said in terms of the war in Ukraine, and the numbers of prisoners taken by both sides, they&apos;re &quot;just two more soldiers.&quot; &quot;And we shouldn&apos;t read too much into it or give too much strategic emphasis on the capture of a couple of soldiers,&quot; he adds. Ryan also doubts that they&apos;ll be able to give Ukraine and Western intelligence agencies much more of an insight into the inner workings of the North Korean military than they already know. &quot;Remember, North Korean soldiers have defected to South Korea before. So, you know, there&apos;s already a flow every now and then of North Koreans that are exploited for intelligence value,&quot; he said. President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed a willingness to return the POWs to North Korea, if the country&apos;s leader Kim Jong Un is able to negotiate the release of Ukrainian POWs in Russia. &quot;For those North Korean soldiers who do not want to return, there may be some other ways,&quot; he added in a post on his official Telegram channel on Jan. 12. But simply swapping North Korean and Ukrainian POWs may not be that simple. According to South Korean officials, North Korean troops fighting for Russia have been ordered to kill themselves rather than be taken prisoner. &quot;Memos found on deceased soldiers indicate that the North Korean authorities pressured them to commit suicide or self-detonate before capture,&quot; lawmaker Lee Seong-kweun told reporters on Jan. 13, citing Seoul&apos;s National Intelligence Service. The claim appeared to be confirmed by a video released on the same day by Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces, showing Ukrainian soldiers storming positions manned by North Korean soldiers. The video shows one of the soldiers &#x2014; who a Ukrainian in the video identifies as &quot;Korean&quot; &#x2014; detonate a grenade near his face when Ukrainian troops approach.

(President Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)A Russian ID document allegedly carried by a captured North Korean POW under the name of a Tuva Republic resident, as seen in a photo published on Jan. 11, 2025.(President Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)Andrew Clapham, professor of international law at the Geneva Graduate Institute, told the Kyiv Independent that this raises &quot;complications&quot; about Ukraine&apos;s stated proposal to return them home in a prisoner swap. &quot;The complication arises if there&apos;s a substantial risk that they would be subjected to human rights violations,&quot; Clapham said, adding: &quot;There&apos;s a chance one would think that they would be punished for failing to carry out those orders (to kill themselves).&quot; Returning the POWs knowing this would be a violation of the Geneva Conventions, Clapham adds. Usually, assurances that the POWs would not be subject to human rights violations would carry some weight, but North Korea&apos;s abysmal human rights record and pariah status complicate matters further. &quot;I think most people wouldn&apos;t accept on face value what are called diplomatic assurances in this context,&quot; Clapham adds. The two North Korean POWs are currently in the custody of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) in Kyiv. Both were wounded and are reportedly receiving medical attention. In videos published by the SBU, one can be seen with his head and chin bandaged, while the other has bandaged hands. The SBU said on Jan. 11 the captured soldiers are being questioned with the help of Korean translators and South Korean intelligence. One has said he was born in 2005 and began serving as a rifleman in North Korea in 2021. &quot;It is noteworthy that the prisoner, like the Russian military at the beginning of the full-scale invasion, emphasizes that he was supposedly going for training and not for a war against Ukraine,&quot; the SBU said. According to the SBU, the other POW was born in 1999 and has served in the North Korean army since 2016 as a sniper reconnaissance officer.

In the video, one of the captured soldiers says he would like to return to North Korea, while the other answers that he wants to live in Ukraine. As of now, it&apos;s unclear where they will end up. &quot;They could remain in Ukrainian hands, or, the suggestion is that they would go to South Korea,&quot; Clapham said. And with fighting ongoing in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, it&apos;s unlikely that they will remain the only North Korean soldiers in such a situation. &quot;In addition to the first captured soldiers from North Korea, there will undoubtedly be others,&quot; Zelensky said on Jan. 12. &quot;It is only a matter of time before our guys manage to capture more.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/everything-we-know-about-the-north-korean-pows-captured-by-ukraine/	2025-01-13T11:24:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-11_13-23-34--2-.jpg
UK to finance production of air defense, long-range weapons in Ukraine, Umerov says	The U.K. will finance the production of air defense systems and long-range weapons in Ukraine, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Jan. 13 following a meeting with U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey in London. &quot;The U.K. has already invested in the production of our weapons, and this collaboration continues &#x2014; specifically, funding will be directed toward the production of air defense systems and long-range weapons,&quot; Umerov wrote on Facebook. Umerov met with Healey to discuss bilateral cooperation in 2025 in key security areas. &quot;The U.K. reaffirmed its commitment to providing continuous and comprehensive support to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s position both on the battlefield and on the international stage,&quot; the minister said. &quot;We anticipate enhanced military, political, and economic assistance from our British allies this year.&quot; Umerov did not provide further details on how London would finance Ukrainian defense industry. In 2025, Ukraine plans to spend a record $35 billion on arms production, of which $17 billion will be financed by the Ukrainian government, according to Umerov. The rest may be supported by allies, he added. Kyiv has ramped up domestic drone production over the past year, as well as the development of new missiles. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks throughout the full-scale war with Russia. Ukraine, in recent months, has championed the development of long-range &quot;missile-drones,&quot; upgraded UAVs with turbojet engines that can act as alternatives to cruise missiles. Kyiv unveiled its Palianytsia and Peklo hybrids in the second half of 2024. Zelensky has said Ukraine aims to produce at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025 and conducted the first successful test of a new Ukrainian missile, dubbed Ruta (Rue).	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-to-finance-production-of-air-defense-long-range-weapons-in-ukraine-umerov-says/	2025-01-13T11:18:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/473372412_998875578727449_8903502460998383258_n.jpg
Volyn exhumations in Ukraine's Ternopil Oblast to begin in April, media reports	Exhumation of the remains of Polish victims of the Volyn tragedy buried in Ternopil Oblast, where the village of Puzhnyky was located in the 1940s, will begin in April, Polish RMF FM reported on Jan. 13. Ukraine and Poland agreed in early 2025 to exhume the first victims of the Volyn tragedy. The Volyn tragedy, also known as the Volyn massacres, took place in 1943 during World War II on the territory of Nazi-occupied Ukraine. Tens of thousands of Poles were killed by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA). Thousands of Ukrainians were also killed in retaliation. The Volyn massacres are a contentious topic between Ukraine and Poland and have often led to soured diplomatic relations. Poland characterizes the events as genocide perpetrated by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), while Ukraine has called for shared acknowledgment of responsibility for the atrocities. The Freedom and Democracy Foundation, which uncovered the grave site two years ago, received permission from the Ukrainian authorities to exhume the remains and conduct further research. The exhumation&apos;s primary purpose is to identify the people whose remains were found in the pit near the former cemetery. Experts are already collecting genetic material from descendants, the media outlet reported. Following the excavation, the remains will be examined by Polish archaeologists and anthropologists, Deputy Chairman of the Freedom and Democracy Foundation Maciej Dancewicz said. The exhumations represent a significant step forward in resolving longstanding historical tensions and strengthening Polish-Ukrainian relations amid challenges posed by Russia&apos;s aggression. President Volodymyr Zelensky and Prime Minister Donald Tusk previously met in Lviv on Dec. 17 to address historical reconciliation, including the legacy of the Volyn massacre.	https://kyivindependent.com/volyn-tragedy-exhumations-in-ukraines-ternopil-oblast-to-begin-in-april-media-reports/	2025-01-13T10:30:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/ad251d9b370ace3d876b64ad229cbd6c_1734456764.jpeg
Fico invited Zelensky to Slovakia to discuss gas transit via Ukraine; Zelensky responds	Editor&apos;s note: The story was updated as President Volodymyr Zelensky responded to Fico&apos;s invitation. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico proposed President Volodymyr Zelensky a meeting in Slovakia to discuss halting the Russian gas transit through Ukraine in his video address on Jan. 13 on Facebook. &quot;Okay. Come to Kyiv on Friday,&quot; Zelensky responded a few hours later to Fico&apos;s call on X. A day prior, Zelensky reacted to Fico&apos;s threats to limit aid to Ukrainians and cut off electricity supplies due to the termination of Russian gas transit through Ukraine to Europe. Zelensky said that Ukraine had offered Slovakia assistance for the adaptation period, but &quot;Fico arrogantly refused.&quot; Fico said he would not respond to Zelensky&apos;s recent statement to avoid &quot;further escalation of tensions.&quot; Fico claimed he wanted to focus instead on &quot;resolving the situation with the shutdown of gas transit.&quot; The Slovakian prime minister said he would like to hold a meeting with Zelensky in Slovakia near the border with Ukraine &quot;as soon as possible.&quot; Fico believed that this move would establish &quot;favorable conditions&quot; for discussing gas supplies to Slovakia and other countries through Ukraine and possible &quot;technical solutions,&quot; considering the termination of the contract between Ukraine and Russia on Dec. 31, 2024. Fico also estimated Slovakia&apos;s alleged losses from stopping Russian gas supplies via Ukraine at 500 million euros ($510 million) per year. Fico and his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban have been among some of the most vocal opponents of Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit. Despite Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, Orban and Fico have continued to maintain friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting with him, and promoting pro-Russian narratives in Europe. Fico previously threatened to cut off electricity supplies to Ukraine amid increasing blackouts due to Russian attacks targeting Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure. While the EU has made efforts to reduce dependency on Russian fossil fuels following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many countries, including Slovakia and Hungary, remain reliant on Russian gas.	https://kyivindependent.com/fico-offers-zelensky-to-meet-discuss-russian-gas-transit-via-ukraine/	2025-01-13T09:05:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188638934.jpg
Vital Pokrovsk coking coal mine halts operation, Reuters reports	As Russian troops continue approaching the city of Pokrovsk, Ukraine halts the extraction of coking coal near the city, Reuters reported on Jan. 13, citing unnamed sources. &quot;They have all stopped working now,&quot; one Reuters source said. &quot;There&apos;s no production there, they&apos;re only working on the surface,&quot; another Reuters source added. The Pokrovsk coal mine, one of the largest in Eastern Europe, is located 10 km (6 miles) west of Pokrovsk. The mine produces coal for coke production needed in steelmaking, which is Ukraine&apos;s second-largest export after agriculture. The coal mine, owned by steelmaker Metinvest BV, was the only one in Ukraine producing coking coal. The eastern front near the town has been the scene of fierce fighting for several months and a focal point of Russia&apos;s offensive in Donetsk Oblast, given Pokrovsk&apos;s importance as a logistics hub for Ukrainian forces. According to trade data, exports of steel products totaled nearly $2 billion in the first eight months of 2024. Experts say Ukrainian steelmakers could have produced up to 7.5 million metric tons of steel by the end of 2024 and planned to increase production to more than 10 million tons in 2025. Losing Pokrovsk, however, would set back production to 2-3 million tons a year.	https://kyivindependent.com/vital-pokrovsk-coking-coal-mine-halts-operation-reuters-reports/	2025-01-13T08:37:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2191667263.jpg

Germany announces first deliveries of promised RCH 155 self-propelled howitzers	Germany delivered the first batch of the promised 54 RCH 155 self-propelled howitzers, the country&apos;s Foreign Minister Boris Pistorius said during a news conference on Jan. 13. Six out of the 54 howitzers will remain in Germany to train Ukrainian personnel. &quot;Ukraine can count on us, and this (the delivery) is a signal. And Germany is ready to take responsibility in Europe,&quot; Pistorius was quoted as saying in the German city of Kassel, where the howitzers are manufactured. Ukraine&apos;s Ambassador to Germany, Oleksii Makeiev, symbolically accepted the first batch on site. Ukraine had requested the RCH 155 in July 2022. The RCH-155 self-propelled howitzer is a new combination of a GTK Boxer APC (armored personnel carrier) with an automated artillery turret of the PzH &#x200B;&#x200B;2000. It fires 155 mm shells to a distance of up to 54 kilometers. It can move quickly on or off-road at speeds of over 100 kilometers per hour due to the wheeled base similar to a heavy-duty armored vehicle. Ukraine is the first country to receive the new RCH 155.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-announces-first-deliveries-of-promised-rch-155-self-propelled-howitzers/	2025-01-13T07:08:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193126935-1.jpg
Russia's energy giant Gazprom plans major layoffs as Europe market shrinks, media reports	The Russian energy giant Gazprom is preparing to lay off 1,600 employees from its central office as it faces significant financial losses and dwindling market presence in Europe, Russia&apos;s local 47News media outlet reported on Jan. 13. The news comes after Ukraine halted the transit of Russian gas to other European countries, ending an arrangement dating back to Soviet times. Deputy Chairman of the Management Committee Elena Ilyukhina reportedly sent a letter to Gazprom CEO Alexey Miller, outlining the need for cost optimization due to &quot;challenges facing the Gazprom Group.&quot; The letter suggests that 50 billion rubles ($480 million) are spent annually on salaries. To address this issue, it proposes reducing the central office workforce from 4,100 to 2,500 employees. Sergey Kupriyanov, deputy chairman of Gazprom&apos;s Board of Directors, confirmed the letter&apos;s authenticity to Forbes Russia but declined to provide further comments. Gazprom has suffered massive losses following the collapse of its European gas market, with exports to Europe dropping by more than 80% since 2021. Shares of the company fell to their lowest level since January 2009, trading at 106.1 rubles ($1.01) on Dec. 17, representing a 33.5% decline since the start of 2024. Heavy taxation further burdened Gazprom, which contributed $28 billion to the Russian government in 2023, accounting for 9% of state revenue. The EU&apos;s decision to pivot to alternative gas sources after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine triggered the decline, significantly reducing Europe&apos;s reliance on Russian supplies, with the exception of countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Austria. Russia&apos;s direct pipeline gas supplies to the EU have now halted completely as Ukraine chose not to prolong the transit deal with Gazprom past Dec. 31, 2024. At the same time, the EU countries purchased record volumes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-energy-giant-gazprom-plans-major-layoffs-media-repots/	2025-01-13T06:13:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1243251198.jpg
Russia's federal budget won't fund anti-drone systems at civilian airports, media reports	Russia will not allocate federal funds to equip civilian airports with anti-drone systems as initially expected, pro-Kremlin publication Vedomosti reported on Jan. 12, citing two undisclosed sources. This decision affects airports classified as Category I transportation infrastructure facilities, raising concerns about the vulnerability of Russia&apos;s civil aviation to drone-related threats. The Russian government was originally expected to spend over 11 billion rubles ($106 million) by 2028 to equip 31 airports, including those in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Sochi, and other major cities, with drone defense systems. However, this funding was not indicated in the relevant federal strategy document on infrastructure security, Vedomosti writes. This means it will be up to the airports&apos; management to ensure security against potential drone threats, the outlet wrote. Russia&apos;s decision not to fund anti-drone systems at key airports highlights gaps in its ability to address potential threats to civil aviation. Effective airport defense systems involve long-range drone detection systems, airspace closure, and neutralization using standard air defense measures. During the full-scale war, Ukraine has launched long-range drone strikes targeting Russian energy, military, and industrial facilities. Russian airports often halt operations for security reasons amid drone attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-cancels-funding-for-anti-drone-systems-at-civilian-airports-media-reports/	2025-01-13T05:46:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-537791492.jpg
EU announces additional $143 million in humanitarian aid for Ukraine	The European Union is allocating an additional 140 million euros ($143 million) in humanitarian assistance for Ukraine, the European Commission said in a statement on Jan. 13. In addition to this sum, the EU will allocate 8 million euros ($8.16 million) to Moldova to support Ukrainian refugees and their host communities. This will bring the overall humanitarian aid provided by the EU to the two countries since 2022 to over 1.1 billion euros ($1.12 billion). &quot;The funding will be directed towards emergency assistance, including food, shelter, clean water, healthcare, and winter protection&#x2026; supporting vulnerable populations in the heavily war impacted regions of eastern and southern Ukraine,&quot; the statement read. The announcement coincides with European Commissioner for Crisis Management Hadja Lahbib&#x2019;s visit to Ukraine. &quot;As Russia continues its cruelty in the dead of winter, the EU is intensifying its support to keep the lights on and homes warm,&quot; the commissioner said in the statement. Russia&apos;s war has resulted in a humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, driving millions from their homes while dealing heavy damage to residential and energy infrastructure. Amid Russia&apos;s invasion, the EU has stepped up support for Ukraine in response to Ukraine&apos;s EU aspirations. Ukraine applied for EU membership days after Russia launched its full-scale war in February 2022 and received candidate status in June of that year. In December 2023, EU leaders agreed to open accession negotiations with Ukraine, which officially began in June 2024. Previously, Katarina Mathernova, the EU ambassador to Ukraine, said 2030 is a very real date for Ukraine to join the European Union.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-announces-143-million-in-humanitarian-aid-for-ukraine/	2025-01-13T05:15:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1239977099.jpg
Ukraine opens doors to foreign firms for military equipment modernization	Ukraine&apos;s government has approved a measure allowing foreign companies to participate in modernizing military equipment for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the Defense Ministry announced on Jan. 13. The initiative focuses on upgrading state aviation aircraft, ships, and their components using advanced Western technologies. The decision aims to foster joint high-tech projects with international partners while adhering to global standards and ensuring transparent cooperation. This move also aligns with Ukraine&apos;s push to expand its defense production capabilities amid the ongoing war with Russia. Foreign firms with special permits for transferring military technology and exporting defense-related goods and services will now be eligible to collaborate, according to Deputy Defense Minister Brigadier General Anatolii Klochko. &quot;Modernizing outdated equipment will significantly enhance its efficiency, leveraging high-tech solutions from foreign partners,&quot; Klochko said. Ukraine allocated Hr 55 billion ($1.3 billion) for weapons production in its 2025 budget, Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin announced on Nov. 12, 2024. Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has actively sought to modernize its defense infrastructure, with an emphasis on integrating Western technologies to bolster its military efficiency and resilience.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-opens-doors-to-foreign-firms-for-military-equipment-modernization/	2025-01-13T04:51:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1494251171-1.jpeg
Russia, Iran to sign strategic partnership agreement on Jan. 17	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Iranian counterpart, Masoud Pezeshkian, will sign a strategic partnership agreement during the latter&apos;s visit to Russia on Jan. 17, the Kremlin&apos;s press service said. The two leaders are also expected to discuss expanding Russian-Iranian bilateral cooperation in &quot;trade, investment, transport, logistics, humanitarian sphere, and current issues on the regional and international agenda,&quot; the statement read. In December 2024, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson announced plans to pen the deal by the end of January. The agreement is expected to cement the growing military and political partnership between Russia and Iran. Moscow has been Tehran&apos;s traditional partner, but their cooperation only intensified after the outbreak of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine in 2022. Iran has provided Russia with thousands of Shahed drones used in attacks against Ukrainian cities, as well as short-range ballistic missiles. Putin signed a similar agreement with North Korea last June, under which both parties agreed to military support each other in case of an armed attack. Months after the deal was signed, North Korea dispatched up to 12,000 troops to help fend off a Ukrainian incursion in Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-iran-to-sign-strategic-partnership-agreement-on-jan-17/	2025-01-13T04:20:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177151439.jpg
EU's Nordic, Baltic members reportedly urge lowering of Russian oil price cap	Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have urged the European Commission to further decrease the $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil set by the G7, Reuters reported on Jan. 13, citing their joint letter seen by the news agency. The countries argue that a lower cap would further restrict Russia&apos;s ability to finance its war against Ukraine while avoiding significant disruptions to global oil markets. Under current terms, Western companies can insure and transport Russian oil only if sold below the cap. In their letter to the European Commission, the six nations reportedly emphasized the need to &quot;further increase the impact of our sanctions by lowering the G7 oil price cap.&quot; The G7 initially implemented the cap to reduce Moscow&apos;s oil revenues while maintaining stability in global markets. With forecasts of a global oil surplus in 2025 and softening prices, the G7 may consider more stringent measures. Sanctions and Ukrainian drone strikes have already disrupted Russia&apos;s oil production, with refineries in Tuapse, Ilyich, and Novoshakhtinsk reducing or halting operations. These pressures have forced Russia&apos;s energy sector to sell oil at a discount and operate under high interest rates, further straining its capacity. The call to lower the price cap reflects ongoing efforts by European nations to maximize economic pressure on Russia while supporting Ukraine&apos;s defense against aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-members-russian-oil-price-cap/	2025-01-13T04:02:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
For the first time, Russia labels independent media outlet as 'terrorist group'	Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB) has designated the independent media outlet Komi Daily as a &quot;terrorist organization,&quot; several news outlets reported on Jan. 13, citing recent changes on the FSB&apos;s website. This marks the first time the FSB has applied such a label to a media outlet. Komi Daily, known for its coverage of culture and daily life in Russia&apos;s northwestern Komi Republic, has been critical of Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine. The outlet has faced escalating state pressure, including website blockages and fines against its editor for alleged incitement. The FSB claims Komi Daily is linked to the Free Nations of Post-Russia Forum, a movement advocating for the decentralization and decolonization of Russia by dismantling it into 41 autonomous states. The outlet denies any affiliation with the forum. The Supreme Court finalized the designation in late December, intensifying Russia&apos;s suppression of dissenting voices, particularly the independent media critical of the Kremlin. The Free Nations of Post-Russia Forum, founded by Ukrainian entrepreneur Oleg Magaletsky and led by exiled Bashkir activist Ruslan Gabbasov, had already been labeled &quot;undesirable&quot; and &quot;terrorist&quot; by Russian authorities. Prosecutors allege the forum supports terrorism and sabotage while promoting the independence of regions like Komi. The FSB&apos;s move is part of an expanding crackdown on independent journalism in Russia. The Kremlin has increasingly targeted media advocating for regional independence or criticizing the government, forcing many journalists into exile.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-labels-komi-daily-as-terrorist-group-first-media-outlet-to-receive-such-designation/	2025-01-13T03:47:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1249615636.jpg
Russia claims to occupy 2 more villages in Ukraine's east; Kyiv hasn't confirmed	Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 12 that its forces had captured the villages of Yantarne in Donetsk Oblast and Kalynove in Kharkiv Oblast. Ukraine has not commented on the claims, which could not be immediately verified. Moscow&apos;s forces have ramped up pressure in Ukraine&apos;s east as Ukrainian defenders find themselves increasingly outnumbered and outgunned. Yantarne lies around 10 kilometers (6 miles) southeast of the eastern town of Kurakhove, almost completely overrun by Russian forces. The Ukrainian military recently claimed it continues to hold positions at the Kurakhove Thermal Power Plant. Russian propagandist Vladimir Solovyov on Jan. 10 shared footage showing Russian soldiers raising flags over damaged buildings, claiming to be located in Yantarne. The estimated Russian advance in the Kurakhove sector in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 12, 2025, according to DeepState. Yantarne marked by a black symbol. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)The Ukrainian war monitoring website DeepState said that the situation in the village is still being clarified without confirming nor denying the loss of Yantarne, while Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces reported engagements in the area on Jan. 12. The northeastern village of Kalynove lies on the west bank of the Oskil River and north of Kupiansk, a key logistical hub liberated by Ukraine during a counteroffensive in the fall of 2022. Russian forces have been attempting to force the Oskil River for months in an attempt to outflank Ukrainian defenders. Andrii Besedin, head of the Kupiansk town military administration, said on Jan. 9 that Moscow&apos;s troops are trying to secure a bridgehead in the town of Dvorichna on the river&apos;s Ukraine-held western bank. Besedin also said that Russian forces are now within 2 kilometers (1.5 miles) of Kupiansk&apos;s outskirts, adding that the situation is &quot;very difficult.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-to-occupy-2-more-villages-in-ukraines-donetsk-kharkiv-oblasts/	2025-01-13T03:28:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190850427.jpg
The question isn't if China will turn on Russia, but when	Like Czar Nicholas II, Russian President Vladimir Putin has misidentified his primary foe. Fighting a war of choice, he allows the real menace to his country to gather strength. China, not Ukraine, constitutes Russia&#x2019;s existential threat. In the Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), Nicholas fought Japan over Manchuria for concessions that Russia could not monetize, instead of investing in the railways and munitions needed to fight the country&#x2019;s actual enemy, Germany, a decade later. Defeat in World War I cost Nicholas and his family their lives after the Bolsheviks seized power. Nobles who did not suffer the same violent fate as the czar fled abroad, often dying in penury. The West and Ukraine never intended to invade Russia, let alone take its territory. Who in the West would want it? China, on the other hand, very well might. Its long list of grievances dates back centuries, to the czars who removed large swaths of territory &#x2014; an area larger than the United States east of the Mississippi River &#x2014; from China&#x2019;s sphere of influence. Putin&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine was a pivotal error &#x2014; the type that precludes a return to the pre-war status quo. Instead, such errors lead to alternatives that are far less desirable. The question is not whether Russia will lose its war against Ukraine (in strategic terms, it already has), but only how big the loss will be. The war has cost Russia more than 700,000 casualties. It has forced Russia to reorient its lucrative European energy trade to less profitable markets. It has depressed productivity through sanctions. It has led to the impoundment of its foreign-exchange reserves, with the accruing interest diverted to Ukraine. It has triggered the flight of hundreds of thousands of prime working-age citizens (often highly educated and in the crucial tech sector). It has precipitated the bombing of Russian factories, military bases, and infrastructure, as well as the first invasion of its territory (in the Kursk region) since World War II. And it has brought about the expansion and reinvigoration of NATO, with Sweden and Finland&#x2019;s accession to membership in the alliance transforming the Baltic Sea into a NATO lake. Even if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump somehow ends the war, Putin cannot reverse these losses. And the longer it continues, the weaker Russia will become, leading many to wonder when it will decide to staunch its losses. Russians ousted Nicholas II for mismanaging the war, wrecking the economy, and being profligate with the lives of his subjects. Like Nicholas&#x2019;s entourage, Putin&#x2019;s is helping him double down on his bad decision to invade Ukraine instead of bailing out while they still can. But the longer they stick with Putin, the greater their vulnerability to China will become.

(Kristina Kormilitsyna/PHOTOHOST AGENCY/Anadolu via Getty Images)The question is not whether China will turn on Russia, but when. China will eventually eat Russia&#x2019;s lunch; the only remaining uncertainty is how big the meal will be. Russia has expended much of its Cold War arsenal on Ukraine, leaving Siberia wide open to Chinese ambitions. Siberia has the resources that China covets: not only energy and minerals, but, more importantly, water. Lake Baikal is larger than Belgium and contains 20% of the world&#x2019;s fresh surface water, which North China desperately needs. Putin apparently intends to escalate his way to victory. The war started with his bungled invasion and attempt at regime change in Kyiv, followed by efforts to bludgeon Ukrainians into submission with massacres of civilians in cities like Bucha, gratuitous destruction of homes and towns, and cross-border abductions of thousands of children. Then came the targeting of civilian shelters, hospitals, schools, museums, and power stations; the summary executions and torture of POWs; the destruction of the massive Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River; threats to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (although Russia, not Ukraine, sits downwind from it); and the use of mines, Turkish drones, ballistic missiles, cluster munitions, glide bombs, and now North Korean troops. If Putin used nuclear weapons, which he has periodically threatened to do, Russians would become the pariahs of the 21st century, replacing the Nazis of the last century. Like the Germans before them, Russians also support wars of territorial conquest. After the Soviet Union&#x2019;s export of its economic model impoverished so much of the world (itself included), nuking a neighbor would cement Russia&#x2019;s status as the world&#x2019;s most regressive country, and its people as the world&#x2019;s most brutal. The negative strategic effects for Russia and Russians would last for generations &#x2014; just ask the Germans. The million-ruble question is whether Putin&#x2019;s entourage intends to stick with him for the entire ride, which would leave them at China&#x2019;s, not Putin&#x2019;s, mercy and headed toward an economic destination similar to that of North Korea. From China, they should expect retribution for Russia&#x2019;s chain of abuse going back to the mid-19th century. Russia&#x2019;s power brokers should ask whose interests the war now serves. At this stage, the answer is clear: Putin&#x2019;s alone. The rest of us can observe their unfolding national disaster as they decide between salvaging what they can and going down with the ship. To avoid the fate of the Russian nobility &#x2014; or falling from high-rise windows &#x2014; the Russian elite could incentivize Putin to retire and cut their country&#x2019;s losses by returning territory in exchange for keeping their personal wealth. Unfortunately, Russians seem to require national catastrophes to precipitate a reassessment of their strategy. Editor&#x2019;s Note: Copyright, Project Syndicate.

Slavoj Žižek: The magic tricks behind Russia’s propaganda machine	I must admit that I occasionally enjoy podcasts explaining the secrets behind well-known magic tricks (the three-shell game, mentalism, levitation, etc.). After reading recent news from Russia, I&#x2019;ve come to the conclusion that these tricks offer a clue to how Russian propaganda has achieved what seems impossible to common sense: claiming that the Russian attack on Ukraine is an act of self-defense. The standard explanation for magic tricks is that they usually rely on at least two different strategies, combining them to produce the desired effects &#x2014; and Russia is doing exactly the same. The Russian government approved a list of 48 foreign states and territories accused of implementing policies that promote destructive neoliberal ideological attitudes, which contradict traditional Russian spiritual and moral values. This list was approved under a decree signed by Putin on Aug. 19, aimed at providing humanitarian support to those &quot;sharing traditional Russian spiritual and moral values.&quot; States on this list are now officially designated as &#x201C;enemy states&#x201D; simply because they don&#x2019;t share these values &#x2014; there&#x2019;s no mention of a multi-polar world; you are an enemy of Russia just for not sharing its values. Oddly, North Korea and Afghanistan are included on this list, but Russia isn&#x2019;t being deceptive: its respect for &#x201C;traditional values&#x201D; aligns with North Korean and Taliban ideology in rejecting the European Enlightenment as the ultimate evil in history. The conflict is thus elevated to a metaphysical-religious level: beneath all the talk of a new multi-polar world lies the vision of a total war to the extinction of two opposites. When religion directly enters politics, the threat of deadly violence is never far behind. Putin recently declared a new nuclear doctrine, announcing that &#x201C;a number of clarifications ... defining the conditions for the use of nuclear weapons&#x201D; were being made to Russia&#x2019;s nuclear doctrine. He added that proposed amendments would expand &#x201C;the category of states and military alliances in relation to which nuclear deterrence is carried out.&#x201D; In a pointed warning to the West, Putin announced that any attack on Russia by a non-nuclear state, supported by a nuclear-armed nation, would be considered a &#x201C;joint attack.&#x201D; He also stated that Moscow reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in case of an attack on Belarus, as it is part of the &#x201C;Union State&#x201D; with Russia, a special partnership between the two nations. This includes cases when the enemy, using conventional weapons, &#x201C;creates critical danger to our sovereignty,&#x201D; Putin said. Russian President Vladimir Putin (C) looks on as Russian military officers lay a wreath during a ceremony at the Unknown Soldier&apos;s Tomb in Moscow, Russia, on June 22, 2022. (Contributor/Getty Images)Such statements make us nostalgic for the Cold War era, when both sides wisely avoided direct nuclear threats and announced they would use nuclear arms only in response to a nuclear strike. The threat of a direct nuclear strike was unmentionable back then. Russia has now asserted the right to a first strike and even expanded the conditions for its use. Of course, an actual Russian first strike remains unlikely, but words in the military domain are never just words &#x2014; they often lead to action. After thousands of pagers exploded in Lebanon, Iran&#x2019;s UN delegate said Israel had &#x201C;crossed a red line&#x201D; again. But today, crossing red lines happens regularly, making the situation even more dangerous because each side thinks it can do so without consequence. The catch is that you can&#x2019;t do this indefinitely: there is a real red line, though it may not be publicly acknowledged, and the only way to learn where it is is to cross it. Our response to Russia should be that Russia itself has crossed the red line by issuing nuclear threats. Those who see the Russia-Ukraine war as a proxy war between NATO and Russia would claim that Russia is under attack by NATO. In some sense, this is true, but in what sense? In the same sense that Israel claims to act in self-defense in Gaza, the West Bank, and Lebanon. The catch lies in how we define the &quot;self&quot; in self-defense. If I occupy land that isn&#x2019;t mine and declare it mine (like the West Bank or parts of Ukraine), and if the land or people there resist, I can claim that my actions to crush them are in self-defense. The two basic strategies Russian state propaganda relies on are these: accuse the opponent of doing what you are doing yourself, in a much more open and brutal way. This distracts the public&#x2019;s attention and makes them accept your basic claim that what you took from the opponent was originally yours. Russia is just defending itself &#x2014; if we accept that Crimea and Donetsk (and perhaps other regions, from the Baltic to Moldova) belong to it, and that Ukraine as a nation doesn&#x2019;t truly exist, but emerged from the minds of Lenin and the Nazis. The second strategy is to accuse the opponent of dangerously approaching a red line after you&#x2019;ve blatantly crossed the only true red line &#x2014; the use of nuclear weapons. This combination of strategies makes rational peace negotiations nearly impossible, because the very terms of negotiation are falsified from the outset. As Luka Lisjak Gabrijel&#x10D;i&#x10D; rightly wrote: &#x201C;Peace is all too precious to be left to peaceniks.&#x201D; Add to this the third strategy of deception: presenting a brutal war of conquest as a defense of spiritual values. This combination is nearly unbeatable. All our hope lies in the &#x201C;nearly.&#x201D; Editor&#x2019;s Note: The opinions expressed in the op-ed section are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/slavoj-zizek-the-magic-tricks-behind-russias-propaganda-machine/	2025-01-13T02:36:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2149287288.jpg
Ukraine's special forces claim to repel North Korean assault in Russia's Kursk Oblast, killing 17 soldiers	Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces repelled an assault by North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the unit&apos;s press service said on Jan. 13, claiming to have killed 17 North Korean soldiers. North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched on Aug. 6. Ukrainian troops have continued fighting in the region, leveraging their positions for potential future negotiations. The battle, the date of which remains undisclosed, lasted from morning until night. The unit released a video of the engagement, showing what are said to be dead and dying North Korean soldiers. A Ukrainian mopping-up group encountered one surviving North Korean fighter who had set an unsuccessful trap. The soldier attempted to mislead the Ukrainian soldiers and then detonated a grenade to avoid capture, fatally injuring himself, according to the Special Operations Forces. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) claimed that North Korean casualties have already reached 300 soldiers killed and 2,700 wounded. The NIS attributed the casualties to their lack of modern warfare training, including ineffective efforts to combat long-range drones. The NIS further alleged that North Korean soldiers had been forced to commit suicide to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces, a claim echoed by White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby on Dec. 27. Kirby said that captured North Korean troops fear their families would face severe retaliation if they surrendered. On Jan. 11, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the capture of two North Korean soldiers in Kursk Oblast. The prisoners of war (POWs), identified by the NIS as members of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea&apos;s military intelligence agency, are in Ukrainian custody and receiving medical treatment.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-repels-north-korean-assault/	2025-01-13T02:19:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-13-at-10_55_37-AM.jpeg
Russian 'shadow fleet' tankers carrying 2 million barrels of crude idling off China’s coast, Bloomberg reports	Three tankers carrying over 2 million barrels of Russian crude oil are floating off China&apos;s coast after they were hit by fresh U.S. sanctions last week, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 13. The vessels are allegedly part of the so-called &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; a group of tankers routinely used to evade sanctions targeting Russia&apos;s oil trade. This development follows the U.S. and U.K.&apos;s most extensive sanctions on Russia&apos;s oil sector, announced on Jan. 10. The measures target over 180 vessels in the shadow fleet, along with Russian oil companies and energy officials. The Huihai Pacific, Mermar, and Olia, each carrying Eastern Siberia&#x2013;Pacific Ocean (ESPO) crude from Russia&apos;s Kozmino port, have diverted from their planned ports in China. The Huihai Pacific, initially headed for Dongjiakou in Shandong province, is now offshore, while the Mermar and Olia, bound for Yantai, are sitting in the Yellow Sea. Reuters reported on Jan. 8 that China&apos;s Shandong Port Group had prohibited U.S.-sanctioned tankers from accessing its ports in the eastern Chinese province. The shadow fleet has also been implicated in transporting sanctioned Iranian oil. The U.S. Treasury&apos;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) identified the tankers as key components of Russia&apos;s strategy to bypass restrictions on its oil exports. The sanctions aim to disrupt Moscow&apos;s ability to fund its war in Ukraine, which President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Jan. 10 a &quot;significant blow to the financial foundation of Russia&apos;s war machine.&quot; China has deepened its ties with Russia since the start of the Kremlin&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, although Beijing has denied accusations of supporting Russia&#x2019;s military efforts. The mounting economic pressure has nevertheless forced many Chinese financial institutions to scale down economic ties with Russia, fearing secondary sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-shadow-fleet-tankers-china/	2025-01-13T01:20:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/3_6978bf53.png
Biden team preparing strong Ukraine policy foundation for Trump handover, Blinken says	The Biden administration is focused on securing a strong foreign policy foundation for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s incoming administration, including on the Russia-Ukraine war, outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Jan. 12. According to Blinken, there is no sense in &quot;speculating on the point&quot; that the war may not end in Ukraine&apos;s favor under the new administration. Trump&apos;s return to the White House on Jan. 20 has sparked concern about the future of the U.S. support for Ukraine. The president-elect has previously criticized military aid for Kyiv and pledged to broker a swift end to the war. &quot;What does make sense is to make sure that we give the next administration, we give the incoming Trump administration, the strongest possible hand for it to play around the world, whether it&apos;s on Ukraine or anything else,&quot; Blinken said. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are expected to hold a phone call soon, according to Mike Waltz, Trump&apos;s nominee for national security adviser. Trump announced on Jan. 9 that plans for a meeting with Putin are underway, though Waltz said the format of the talks remains undecided. The Kremlin welcomed Trump&apos;s readiness for dialogue but ruled out a face-to-face meeting before Trump&apos;s inauguration. Moscow previously rejected Trump&apos;s team&apos;s proposed peace plan, which included freezing front lines, delaying Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers. Outgoing President Joe Biden expressed confidence on Jan. 10 in his administration&apos;s support for Ukraine, saying, &quot;I did all I could to help,&quot; while voicing hope for continued U.S. backing under Trump.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-team-prepares-strong-ukraine-policy-handover-to-trump-blinken-says/	2025-01-13T01:00:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170662132.jpg
Lithuania to deliver 4,500 drones to Ukraine this week	Lithuania is providing Ukraine with 4,500 drones worth 5 million euros ($5.1 million) in the coming days, Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene announced on Jan. 12. Drones have proven crucial for both sides of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Kyiv employs unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) of various types for reconnaissance and attack roles at the front lines and for long-range strikes in the Russian rear. Sakaliene&apos;s statement came shortly after the Lithuanian broadcaster LRT reported that thousands of drones, which were to be delivered to Ukraine several months ago, are still in Lithuanian warehouses as their delivery is delayed by bureaucratic obstacles.

Separately, Vilnius also pledged to help fund the production of Ukrainian long-range drones, focusing on Ukraine&apos;s new Palianytsia missile-like drones. &quot;In addition, during the last government meeting, we approved a new faster procedure for transferring state assets,&quot; Sakaliene said, explaining that the changes &quot;will significantly reduce the time required for procedures, ensuring that aid reaches Ukraine faster.&quot; Lithuania has been one of the staunchest supporters of Ukraine during the full-scale invasion, pledging to provide 0.25% of its GDP in military aid to Ukraine on a yearly basis. The Baltic country has supplied 840 million euros ($860 million) in security assistance to Ukraine as of October 2024, making it one of the leading donors in terms of GDP shares, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy said.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-to-deliver-4-500-drones-to-ukraine-this-week/	2025-01-13T00:50:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GhHR1TmXYAAtcJo.jpeg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 1, injure 17 over past day	Russian strikes against Ukraine killed one civilian and injured 17 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 13. Russian forces launched 110 drones at Ukraine overnight from the directions of Millerovo, Bryansk, Orel, and Primosk-Akhtarsk in Russia, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare units, and mobile firing groups shot down 78 drones in the Poltava, Sumy, Kharkiv, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi and Donetsk oblasts. Thirty-one drones were lost allegedly due to electronic warfare countermeasures. Sumy Oblast: In Sumy, debris from a Russian Shahed-type drone caused a large fire at a children&apos;s health and wellness center. No casualties were reported. An FPV drone strike in the Myropilska community damaged a bus and injured three civilians. As a result of artillery shelling, a fire broke out in a residential building in the Seredyna-Buda community, with one civilian injured, according to the regional military administration. Kherson Oblast: The Russian military attacked critical and social infrastructure facilities, as well as residential areas of the oblast&apos;s settlements. As a result of the attacks, 10 people were injured, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. Donetsk Oblast: A person was injured in Pokrovsk as a result of a Russian attack, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin Zaporizhia Oblast: Two civilians sustained blast and limb injuries during a Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia, Governor Ivan Fedorov confirmed. Kharkiv Oblast: In Kupiansk, a 70-year-old man died as a result of shelling near the territory of a civilian enterprise, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-8/	2025-01-12T23:56:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-12_16-57-51.jpg
Poland denies banning Slovak delegation's flight to Moscow through Polish airspace	The Polish Foreign Ministry denied claims by Slovak far-right lawmaker Andrej Danko that Warsaw did not permit a Slovak delegation to fly to Moscow through Polish airspace, the Polsat News channel reported on Jan. 12. &quot;We didn&apos;t refuse the flight; the Slovak side simply sent us incomplete documents... when they were asked to complete them, they informed us about the change of route,&quot; the Polish Foreign Ministry&apos;s spokesperson said. The delegation, led by Danko, Slovak National Party (SNS) chairman and deputy parliament speaker, and Tibor Gaspar, a member of Prime Minister Robert Fico&apos;s Smer (Direction) party, arrived in Moscow on Jan. 12 to discuss Russian gas supplies to Slovakia. Russian-friendly nationalist Danko earlier accused Warsaw of preventing the flight from entering its airspace, forcing the plane to travel over Czechia and Germany. &quot;I don&apos;t understand Poland&apos;s position, but I take it as a reality,&quot; he said. The Slovak delegates are expected to meet representatives of the Russian State Duma and other government officials. According to Gaspar, the group will ask whether Russia&apos;s state-owned energy company Gazprom can continue to supply gas to Slovakia despite Ukraine&apos;s decision to halt the transit of Russian gas through its territory. The stoppage of Russian gas flows via Ukraine has heightened tensions between Kyiv and Bratislava. Fico, already critical of military aid to Ukraine and sanctions against Russia, threatened to cut energy and humanitarian support after the transit deal expired. Despite the EU&apos;s attempts to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels in the wake of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, countries like Slovakia and Hungary remain heavily reliant on Russian gas. The delegation is expected to return to Slovakia on Jan. 15.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-denies-banning-slovak-delegations-flight-to-moscow-through-polish-airspace/	2025-01-12T23:15:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/473154311_18306837598206919_1258937468260133086_n.jpg
Lack of understanding of modern warfare' — Seoul reports 3,000 North Korean casualties in Russia's Kursk Oblast	At least 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and another 2,700 wounded fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) claimed on Jan. 13, according to the South Korean Yonhap news agency. The NIS attributed the high casualties to the soldiers&apos; &quot;lack of understanding of modern warfare,&quot; including their &quot;useless&quot; attempts to shoot down long-range drones. North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched on Aug. 6. Ukrainian forces have continued fighting in the region, leveraging their positions for potential future negotiations. The NIS remarks follow President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s claim on Jan. 9 that North Korean forces fighting alongside Russian troops have suffered 4,000 casualties, both killed and wounded. The NIS reported that North Korea has allegedly forced its soldiers to kill themselves to avoid capture by Ukrainian troops. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby confirmed on Dec. 27 that some North Korean soldiers had taken their own lives, fearing retaliation against their families if captured. On Jan. 11, Zelensky announced the capture of two North Korean soldiers in Kursk Oblast. The prisoners of war (POWs), identified by the NIS as members of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea&#x2019;s military intelligence agency, are now in the custody of Ukraine&#x2019;s Security Service (SBU) and receiving medical care. Zelensky shared video footage of the SBU interrogating the POWs with the assistance of Korean translators. In the video, one soldier expressed a desire to return to North Korea, while the other said he wished to remain in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-losses-kursk/	2025-01-12T22:55:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1074306244.jpg

Russian drone strikes on Sumy Oblast spark fire at children's wellness center, 2 injured in attack on bus	Russian drones struck civilian infrastructure in Sumy Oblast on Jan. 12, leading to multiple casualties. In the regional capital Sumy, debris from a Russian Shahed-type drone caused a large fire at a children&apos;s health and wellness center, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration reported. No casualties were reported as a result of the attack, and the extent of the damage was not immediately clear. Earlier in the day, around 3:15 p.m. local time, Russian forces used a drone to strike a civilian bus in the village of Myropillia, injuring two people, the Sumy Oblast Prosecutor&apos;s Office reported. Two women, aged 30 and 42, were injured in the attack. No details were provided on the status of the victims. Shelling is a daily occurrence for the communities near Ukraine&apos;s northeastern border with Russia, with residents in the region&apos;s vulnerable border settlements experiencing multiple attacks per day. Throughout the day, Russia struck 13 communities across Sumy Oblast in 68 different attacks on the region, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration said. Russian strikes against Sumy Oblast have become increasingly destructive over the past year, amid fears that Russia may launch a new attack on Sumy Oblast in the coming months.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-strike-on-sumy-oblast-sparks-fire-in-childrens-wellness-center-2-injured-in-attack-on-bus/	2025-01-12T18:41:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-12_16-57-51.jpg
German Defense Minister denies Scholz blocked proposal for $3 billion arms package for Ukraine, says decision awaits	German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius denied media reports that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz blocked a proposal for an additional military aid package for Ukraine worth 3 billion euros ($3.09 billion), adding that a decision on the funding awaits. &quot;There is no blockade. We have prepared a new aid package for Ukraine in the Defense Ministry,&quot; Pistorius told Tagesspiegel in an interview published on Jan. 13. &quot;(A decision to approve the aid package) must now be decided politically... As soon as all questions have been clarified, I expect a corresponding decision,&quot; Pistorius added. Spiegel reported on Jan. 9, citing its undisclosed sources, that Scholz blocked a proposal for an additional military aid package, reportedly claiming that the existing allocation of 4 billion euros ($4.1 billion) for 2025, as well as funds from the $50 billion G7 loan financed by frozen Russian assets, should be sufficient support for Ukraine. Scholz also reportedly expressed concern that the new government could take on significant financial obligations after early federal elections in February if the package was allowed to go ahead. Under Scholz&apos;s leadership, Germany has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. The chancellor has nevertheless often been criticized for his cautious approach on some key issues, such as his refusal to provide Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine. The new assistance plan, proposed by German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and Pistorius, was for additional weapons including three additional Iris-T air defense batteries, 10 howitzers, and more artillery ammunition, according to Spiegel. Pistorius and Baerbock hoped to gain parliamentary support for their proposal before the federal elections, and presented their proposal as &quot;a vital signal of Germany&apos;s unwavering support.&quot; Following the media reports of the blockade on Jan. 10, Baerbock neither confirmed nor denied reports of the halt in aid. Despite Scholz&apos;s lack of support, Pistorius reiterated Germany&apos;s support during a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, also known as Ramstein, on Jan. 9, according to Spiegel. Pistorius announced the provision of nearly 50 guided missiles for the Iris-T air defense system. The missiles, originally designed for the Bundeswehr, were redirected directly from production to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-defense-minister-denies-scholz-blocked-proposal-for-3-billion-arms-package-for-ukraine-says-decision-awaits/	2025-01-12T17:43:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/PistoriusRamstein.jpg
Russian-friendly incumbent Zoran Milanovic re-elected president of Croatia	Croatia&apos;s populist incumbent president, Zoran Milanovic, was re-elected to the post by a wide margin on Jan. 12, election results show. Milanovic defeated Dragan Primorac, the candidate of Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic&#x2019;s HDZ party, by a margin of 74.7% to 25.3%, with 99% of polls reporting. The total turnout sat around 44% of eligible voters. Milanovic is a staunch critic of Western aid for Ukraine as well as the country&apos;s future accession into the military alliance. He previously referred to Ukraine&apos;s 2014 Euromaidan protests as a &quot;coup d&apos;&#xE9;tat&quot; and has railed against Western allies and Ukraine for not respecting the Minsk Agreements. In October, Milanovic refused to approve the participation of Croatian soldiers in NATO&apos;s mission to support Ukraine. Milanovic&apos;s re-election to the largely symbolic position serves as a setback for Plenkovic&#x2019;s government, whose government was recently embroiled in a corruption scandal implicating a former health minister. Milanovic, who served as Croatia&apos;s prime minister from 2011 to 2016 amid the country&apos;s accession into the European Union, was first elected to the presidency in 2020 with the support of the opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP). &quot;This is the beginning of the end for Andrej Plenkovic,&quot; SDP leader Sinisa Hajdas Doncic said following Milanovic&apos;s victory. The Croatian government, mainly aligned with Plenkovic, has strongly supported military aid to Kyiv, including the delivery of 14 Mi-8 helicopters, and Plenkovic himself has made several visits to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-friendly-incumbent-zoran-milanovic-re-elected-president-of-croatia/	2025-01-12T16:09:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/gettyimages-2193017861-612x612.jpg
Sweden to increase military presence in Baltic Sea following suspected cable sabotage	Sweden will increase its military presence in the Baltic Sea through the deployment of three warships and a radar reconnaissance aircraft in response to the suspected sabotage of several underwater cables, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on Jan. 12. &quot;These warships are placed under NATO command and they are used to create better conditions for a maritime situation picture in the Baltic Sea,&quot; Kristersson said on the sidelines of a security conference in Salen. Over the past six months, several telecommunication and energy cables underneath the Baltic Sea have been damaged, with four telecom cables and one power cable severed on Dec. 25. Only two of those cables of the Christmas incident were repaired by Jan. 7. Authorities suspect the Russian shadow vessel Eagle S of the sabotage. Sweden&apos;s decisions follows soon after a decision announced by nearby NATO allies Finland and Estonia to send a fleet of up to 10 NATO vessels will guard the infrastructure under the Baltic Sea until April. The shadow fleet refers to a group of aging, poorly insured tankers Russia uses to avoid international sanctions on its oil trade. Moscow also uses these vessels for espionage. NATO previously said it is increasing its military presence in the Baltic Sea to bolster situational awareness and deter potential threats. NATO officials have raised alarm over a growing number of Russian sabotage operations in Europe since the West threw its support behind Kyiv after the outbreak of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Finland will host a summit for NATO member states with access to the Baltic Sea on Jan. 14 to address regional security threats, including the suspected Russian sabotage, the Finnish president&apos;s office announced on Jan. 8.	https://kyivindependent.com/sweden-to-increase-military-presence-in-baltic-sea-following-suspected-cable-sabotage/	2025-01-12T14:54:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1839741170.jpg
Ukrainians can help Americans protect lives' — Zelensky says Kyiv ready to send firefighters to California	Ukraine is preparing to send rescuers, including 150 firefighters, to the U.S. state of California to help combat the wildfires that have devastated the region in recent days, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 12. Wildfires have ravaged the city of Los Angeles in the past week, killing at least 16 people, displacing hundreds of thousands of residents, and destroying or damaging over 10,000 structures. &quot;Today, I instructed Ukraine&apos;s Interior Minister and our diplomats to prepare for the possible participation of our rescuers in combating the wildfires in California,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address on Jan 12. &quot;The situation there is extremely challenging, and Ukrainians can help Americans protect lives. This matter is being worked out, and through appropriate channels, we have offered our assistance to the American side. We already have 150 firefighters prepared.&quot; Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko and a team of diplomats are looking into the situation, the ministry said. Zelensky&apos;s offer of assistance comes three days after Donald Trump Jr., son of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, responded to the Los Angeles wildfires by blaming Ukraine on social media. &quot;Oh look of course the LA fire department donated a bunch of their supplies to Ukraine,&quot; Trump. Jr. said in a post on X on Jan. 8. The Los Angeles County Fire Department sent surplus materials to Ukraine back in 2022, following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The aid included boots, hoses, body armor, and medication. The donation did not likely impact the response to the current crisis, which has been exacerbated by strong winds, personnel issues, and water shortages.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-can-help-americans-protect-lives-zelensky-says-kyiv-ready-to-send-firefighters-to-california/	2025-01-12T14:31:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192311233.jpg
Serbian president offers to host Trump-Putin meeting in Belgrade	Serbia will officially offer to host the upcoming meeting between U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said in a television broadcast on Jan. 12. Trump announced on Jan. 9 that plans for a meeting with Putin were already underway, but no concrete details have been made public. Belgrade is ready to host the future meeting and can guarantee appropriate security for both leaders, Vucic told the Serbian Broadcasting Corporation (RTS). &quot;(Serbia) is the country where President Trump had the greatest support in all of Europe,&quot; Vucic said. &quot;There is no country that can compare to Serbia in terms of the level of support for President Trump. ... And on the other hand, it is a country where President Putin is still very, very popular. So, I think that this is a place on the globe that would be extremely suitable for both of them.&quot; Serbia is well-suited to host Trump and Putin because it is not a member of any military alliances, such as NATO, Vucic said. Serbia maintains a friendly attitude toward Russia and has refused to join international sanctions against Moscow in the wake of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. At the same time, Vucic has called Ukraine a &quot;friendly country&quot; and previously affirmed that Crimea and Donbas are Ukrainian sovereign territories. Switzerland has also put itself forward as a potential site for the Trump-Putin talks. Nicolas Bideau, head of communications at the Swiss Foreign Ministry, told Swiss media on Jan. 12 that Switzerland had already communicated its willingness to host the meeting. The framework of the upcoming meeting is still being determined, incoming U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said on Jan. 12. A phone call between Trump and Putin to work out the details is expected &quot;in the coming days and weeks.&quot; The Kremlin has said a face-to-face meeting between the two leaders will have to wait until after Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20.	https://kyivindependent.com/serbian-president-offers-to-host-trump-putin-meeting-in-belgrade/	2025-01-12T13:06:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192588495.jpg
The Week Ahead: Key Developments Impacting Global Politics & Markets	Editor&apos;s note: This article is an on-site version of KI Insights&apos; The Week Ahead newsletter covering events from Jan. 13 to Jan. 20. Sign up here to start your week with an agenda of Ukraine-related events, delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday. With 8 eight days left until the Jan. 20 inauguration of Donald Trump, global policy makers are ramping up preparations for what a Trump 2 presidency could bring. Although the incoming administration has hardly been quite (incl. with concerning statements on NATO, Greenland, Canada and the Panama canal), the coming weeks will provide an indication on what is posturing and what is policy &#x2013; and what decisions need to be made. Military planning and security, as well as the viability of major global alliances, will be a key theme. On Jan. 13 NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte will attend a joint committee meeting at the European Parliament. The session takes place amid questions about the US commitment to European security (a live stream of Rutte&#x2019;s remarks and session transcript will be available on the NATO website). Jan. 15-16 NATO&#x2019;s Military Committee will convene in Brussels. The meeting will bring together Allied Chiefs of Defense and over 20 counterparts from NATO Partner nations to discuss strategic issues and foster cooperation in addressing global challenges. The first session will feature General Cavoli, the United States European Command commander, briefing on NATO&#x2019;s readiness to deter and defend the Euro-Atlantic region while safeguarding its one billion inhabitants. Discussions will explore NATO&#x2019;s ongoing missions and support for Ukraine, including the NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU), which has taken on responsibilities to bolster Ukraine&#x2019;s defense. Rutte will join the opening session to outline key priorities and challenges for the alliance. The Ad Hoc Working Party on the Multi-Agency Donor Coordination Platform for Ukraine will convene at the European Council headquarters in Brussels on Jan. 17. This meeting will bring together representatives from EU member states, international organizations, and other stakeholders to coordinate strategies for providing aid and supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s immediate financing needs and its long-term economic recovery and reconstruction efforts. In global news, on Jan. 14 South Korea&#x2019;s Constitutional Court will begin the impeachment trial of President Yoon Suk Yeol (he will not attend, being &#x201C;holed up&#x201D; in his residence to avoid arrest). South Korea&#x2019;s internal turmoil complicates support to Ukraine, which was set to ramp up due to North Korea&#x2019;s entry into the war. In the latest chapter of France&#x2019;s tumultuous internal politics, the new centrist Prime Minister Fran&#xE7;ois Bayrou is expected to lay out his policy priorities on Tuesday Jan. 14 in his first address to the French parliament. A driving force of political disruption, TikTok is set to shut down in the US on Jan. 19 unless President-elect Donald Trump finds a way to save the platform. The Supreme Court has signaled it will uphold the ban, which could impact 170 mn US users. Looking forward, the diplomatic year will kick off in full swing with the World Economic Forum&#x2019;s Annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 20-24. Of note, Ukraine will enter a period of mostly painful historical anniversaries, starting with the Jan. 19 Hrushevskoho street riots (a turning point in the EuroMaidan revolution, following the passage of anti-protest &#x201C;dictatorial&#x201D; laws) and the Unity Day on Jan. 22 (when the West Ukrainian People&#x2019;s Republic and Ukrainian People&#x2019;s Republic formed a short-lived, independent union). This period will continue through Feb. 24, which will mark 3 years of full-scale war against Russia.

Ukraine ready to return North Korean POWs to Kim Jong Un or find 'other ways,' Zelensky says	Ukraine is prepared to send captured North Korean soldiers home if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is able to negotiate the release of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) in Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 12. Alternatively, Kyiv is willing to explore other options for North Korean soldiers who do not wish to return, he said. Zelensky&apos;s remarks come a day after the president announced on Jan. 11 that Ukrainain forces had captured two North Korean POWs in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. The wounded soldiers are in the custody of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and are reportedly receiving medical attention. &quot;In addition to the first captured soldiers from North Korea, there will undoubtedly be others,&quot; Zelensky said via his official Telegram channel on Jan. 12. &quot;It is only a matter of time before our guys manage to capture more.&quot; Ukraine is prepared to return North Korean personnel in future prisoner exchanges or explore &quot;other ways&quot; of handling those captured soldiers who do not want to go back to North Korea, according to Zelensky. &quot;Ukraine is ready to hand over his people to Kim Jong Un if he can organize their exchange for our soldiers who are held captive in Russia,&quot; he said. &quot;For those North Korean soldiers who do not want to return, there may be some other ways. In particular, those Koreans who wish to bring peace closer by spreading the truth in Korean about this war will have this opportunity.&quot; Zelensky posted video footage of the SBU&apos;s interrogation of the two POWs, mediated by Korean translators. In the video, one of the captured soldiers says he would like to return to North Korea, while the other answers that he wants to live in Ukraine. Some 12,000 North Korean soldiers have been deployed in Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion in August 2024. North Korean personnel have suffered high casualties while fighting alongside Russian forces, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Dec. 27 that some North Korean soldiers have reportedly taken their own lives rather than surrender to Ukrainian troops, out of fear their families will be targeted over their capture. Zelensky said on Jan. 11 that the capture of the North Korean POWs was a difficult task to carry out, as Russian and North Korean forces go to greath lengths to suppress evidence of Pyongyang&apos;s involvement.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-ready-to-return-north-korean-pows-to-kim-jong-un-or-find-other-ways-zelensky-says/	2025-01-12T12:07:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-11_13-23-36--2-.jpg
Fico refused Kyiv's offers to help with gas supplies, Zelensky says	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico refused Ukraine&apos;s offers of assistance following the discontinuation of Russian gas flows via Ukrainian territory, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 12. Zelensky&apos;s comments come shortly after Fico lambasted Ukraine as an unreliable partner and accused Zelensky of &quot;begging and blackmailing&quot; European leaders. &quot;We offered our assistance to the people of Slovakia during their adaptation to the absence of Russian gas transit, but Fico arrogantly refused,&quot; Zelensky said in a post on X. &quot;Many in Europe warned him that doing nothing and waiting was not an option. Now, he&apos;s resorting to PR, lies, and loud accusations to shift the blame away from himself onto someone else.&quot; Ukraine did not renew a pre-war agreement to transit Russian gas to Europe via Ukrainian territory, instead allowing the deal to expire on Jan. 1. Kyiv warned repeatedly that it would not extend the deal in order to stop financing Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Slovakia, still heavily reliant on Russian gas even as other EU countries find alternative energy providers, harshly criticized Ukraine&apos;s decision. Fico has threatened to cut off humanitarian aid and electricity supplies to Ukraine in retaliation. Zelensky condemned Fico&apos;s threat, accusing him of opening &quot;a second energy front against Ukraine&quot; at the behest of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Fico met with Putin in Moscow on Dec. 22, a week before the transit deal was set to expire. A delegation of Slovak far-right MPs also departed for Moscow on Jan. 12 to hold talks with Russian government officials on continuing gas supplies and other issues. Zelensky said that Fico&apos;s refusal to find an alternative energy supplier was the result of his misplaced loyalty to Russia. &quot;But the real problem is that he bet on Moscow, not on his own country, not on a united Europe, and certainly not on common sense,&quot; Zelensky said on Jan. 12. &quot;From the beginning, it was a losing bet.&quot; Zelensky said he hoped that Europe and the U.S. would collaborate effectively to diversify energy supplies to Europe and &#xA0;&quot;address the challenges caused by the shortsightedness of certain European figures.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/fico-refused-kyivs-offers-to-help-with-gas-supplies-zelensky-says/	2025-01-12T11:19:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187689001.jpg
Far-right Slovak delegation flies to Moscow for talks on Russian gas supplies	A group of far-right Slovak MPs departed for Moscow on Jan. 12 to hold talks with Russian government officials on the continuation of Russian gas supplies and other issues, the Slovak news agency TASR reported. The visit comes weeks after Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin on Dec. 22. The delegation is led by Andrej Danko, the chair of the co-ruling far-right Slovak National Party (SNS) and current deputy speaker of parliament, and Tibor Gaspar, a member of Fico&apos;s Smer (Direction) party, TASR reported. Danko, a Russian-friendly nationalist, said on Jan. 5 that the visit aims to &quot;restore some relations with Russia.&quot; Danko also claimed that Poland refused to allow the delegation&apos;s flight to enter their airspace, and that their plane had to be rerouted via Czechia and Germany. &quot;I don&apos;t understand Poland&apos;s position, but I take it as a reality,&quot; he said. The Slovak delegates will reportedly meet with representatives from the Russian State Duma and other government officials. According to Gaspar, the group will ask whether Russia&apos;s state-owned energy company Gazprom can continue to supply gas to Slovakia despite Ukraine&apos;s decision to halt the transit of Russian gas through its territory. The stoppage of Russian gas flows via Ukraine has heightened tensions between Kyiv and Bratislava. Fico, already critical of military aid to Ukraine and sanctions against Russia, threatened to cut energy and humanitarian support after the transit deal expired. Despite the EU&apos;s attempts to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels in the wake of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, countries like Slovakia and Hungary remain heavily reliant on Russian gas. The delegation is expected to return to Slovakia on Jan. 15.	https://kyivindependent.com/far-right-slovak-delegation-flies-to-moscow-for-talks-on-russian-gas-supplies/	2025-01-12T10:19:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/danko-1.jpeg
Ukraine war latest: 'Irrefutable evidence of North Korea's involvement' — Ukraine says it captured 2 North Korean POWs in Kursk Oblast	Key developments on Jan. 12: Ukrainian troops captured two North Korean soldiers as prisoners of war (POWs) in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 11. &quot;This task was not easy,&quot; he said in a Telegram post. &quot;Usually, Russia and other North Korean military personnel finish off their wounded and do everything possible to ensure that no evidence of the participation of another state &#x2014; North Korea &#x2014; in the war against Ukraine is preserved.&quot; The two wounded soldiers received necessary medical care and are in the custody of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) in Kyiv, according to Zelensky. The president applauded Ukrainian paratroopers and soldiers from the Special Operation Forces for capturing the North Koreans. North Korea deployed around 12,000 soldiers in Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion in August 2024 to bring the war to Russia, a senior Ukrainian official familiar with the intelligence told the Kyiv Independent in December 2024. Zelensky&apos;s statement comes nearly two weeks after the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS) said that Ukrainian troops had captured a wounded North Korean soldier in late December who died soon of his wounds. &quot;We confirmed through a friendly nation&apos;s intelligence organization that a North Korean soldier, captured alive on Dec. 26, died a short while ago as (his) wounds worsened,&quot; the NIS said on Dec. 27, as cited by South Korean Yonhap News Agency. Applauding the &quot;irrefutable evidence&quot; of North Korean soldiers&apos; participation in the Russian war against Ukraine, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on Jan. 11 that the POWs are being questioned with the help of Korean translators and South Korean intelligence. A Ukrainian drone hit the Taneko oil refinery in Tatarstan, Russian Telegram channel ASTRA reported on Jan. 11. The refinery is one of the country&apos;s largest oil-processing facilities. Workers at the refinery in Nizhnekamsk were evacuated amid the attack, and local footage showed smoke rising from the site. Andrii Kovalenko, Head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation, confirmed the strike, and emphasized its strategic importance. &quot;The refinery plays a key role in providing fuel to the Russian military. Taking out refineries and oil depots directly affects Russia&apos;s ability to wage an intensive war,&quot; he said. The refinery, which processes over 16 million tons of oil annually, was previously targeted in a drone attack in spring 2024, causing damage to its primary processing unit. Taneko refinery is located in the city of Nizhnekamsk, around 1,300 kilometers from the country&apos;s border with Ukraine. Russian troops have carried out a double airstrike on a nursing home in the Ukrainian-occupied Russian town of Sudzha, Kursk Oblast, Ukrainian military spokesperson Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, said on Jan. 12. According to Dmytrashkivskyi, the attack, which took place on the evening of Jan. 11, left one woman with severe arm injuries, who died later in the morning of Jan. 12. The attack also dealt heavy damage to the nursing home, with all windows and doors blown out, Dmytrashkivskyi added, speaking on national television. According to him, around 2,000 Russian civilians remain in areas under Ukrainian control. Over 70 people are currently staying in the nursing home that came under attack. &quot;The question now is where to relocate these people. Most are elderly, and many suffer from disabilities, Parkinson&apos;s disease, post-stroke conditions, and one individual has a mental illness. The current state of these people is quite severe,&quot; the spokesperson said. In a comment to the Kyiv Independent, Dmytrashkivskyi confirmed that the facility damaged was the same nursing home visited by media, including the Kyiv Independent, on press tours of Sudzha organized by the Ukrainian military. The news comes days after Ukraine reportedly launched renewed offensive operations in Kursk Oblast, which is seen as a crucial bargaining chip for potential peace negotiations. Russian troops have been spotted dressing in civilian clothing to mask their movements in Toretsk, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s 28th Mechanized Brigade reported on Jan. 12. Aerial reconnaissance footage posted by the brigade on Facebook shows a couple of alleged Russian soldiers dressed in civilian clothes. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the images. The brigade said it was &quot;another violation of the rules of warfare&quot; by Russian troops, as it can be classified as a war crime under international law. According to the brigade, Russian infantrymen &quot;attempt to divert attention and disguise themselves&quot; in this way. &quot;However, they are exposed by their identical clothing, behavior, and sometimes even their weapons,&quot; the brigade wrote. &quot;Nevertheless, this still complicates the work of our soldiers, as the Ukrainian Armed Forces do not &apos;shoot at everything that moves,&apos; unlike (Russian) occupiers.&quot; Back in September, Ukraine accused Russian forces of 137,000 war crimes carried out as part of its full-scale invasion. Crimes include the mass abduction of Ukrainian children, the torture of residents in occupied territories, and the murder of civilians and Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs). Earlier on Jan. 6, Ukraine&#x2019;s Ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, reported that Russian troops had allegedly killed three Ukrainian POWs in the southwest of Donetsk Oblast. &quot;We are once again witnessing atrocities that demonstrate Russia&apos;s true face,&quot; the ombudsman said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-irrefutable-evidence-of-north-koreas-involvement-ukraine-says-it-captured-2-north-korean-pows-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-01-12T09:28:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/uwl.jpeg
Trump, Putin call expected in near future, incoming national security adviser says	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are expected to hold a telephone call &quot;in the coming days and weeks,&quot; Mike Waltz, Trump&apos;s nominee for national security adviser, told ABC News on Jan. 12. Waltz&apos;s comments come shortly after Trump announced on Jan. 9 that plans for a meeting between the two leaders were already in the works. &quot;The preparations are underway,&quot; Waltz told ABC News in response to a question about the upcoming meeting. &quot;You can&apos;t enter a deal if you don&apos;t have some type of relationship or dialogue with the other side and we will absolutely establish that in the coming months.&quot; Waltz did not set a date for the planned meeting. When asked if the talks would include President Volodymyr Zelensky, he said the format of the meeting had not yet been determined. &quot;Well, we haven&apos;t set the exact framework for it yet, we&apos;re working on that, but I do expect a call, at least in the coming days and weeks, so that would be a step, and we&apos;ll take it from there,&quot; Waltz said. Switzerland has indicated its willingness to host an in-person meeting between Trump and Putin, Nicolas Bideau, head of communications at the Swiss Foreign Ministry, said on Jan. 12. Waltz did not provide any information on where the upcoming meeting might take place. The Kremlin on Jan. 10 said it &quot;welcomed&quot; Trump&apos;s readiness for dialogue on Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, but said no concrete plans had been made and a face-to-face meeting would not occur until after Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20. Moscow has previously rejected the terms of a peace proposal leaked by Trump&apos;s team, one that involved freezing the front lines, postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground. While Waltz did not go into specifics regarding the content of the talks or plans for peace, he did mention Ukraine&apos;s &quot;manpower issues&quot; and said Kyiv could resolve them by lowering the draft age from 26 to 18. &quot;If Ukrainians have asked the entire world to be all in for democracy, we need them to be all in for democracy ... We need to see those manpower issues addressed,&quot; he said. Waltz also said it wasn&apos;t &quot;realistic&quot; to expect a complete withdrawal of Russian troops from occupied regions of Ukraine, including Crimea. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-putin-call-expected-in-near-future-incoming-national-security-adviser-says/	2025-01-12T08:55:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1229490488.jpg

(TRO Media/Courtesy)In a comment to the Kyiv Indpendent, Dmytrashkivskyi confirmed that the facility damaged was the same nursing home visited by media, including the Kyiv Independent, on press tours of Sudzha. The news comes days after Ukraine reportedly launched renewed offensive operations in Kursk Oblast, which is seen as a crucial bargaining chip for potential peace negotiations. Ukrainian forces launched a large-scale operation in Kursk Oblast in early August, allegedly capturing up to 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian soil. Since then, Russia has deployed reinforcements &#x2014; including North Korean soldiers &#x2014; in the area and reportedly retook around half of the lost territory. Earlier on Jan. 11, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Ukrainian troops captured two North Korean soldiers as prisoners of war (POWs) in Kursk Oblast. &quot;This task was not easy,&quot; he said in a Telegram post. &quot;Usually, Russia and other North Korean military personnel finish off their wounded and do everything possible to ensure that no evidence of the participation of another state &#x2014; North Korea &#x2014; in the war against Ukraine is preserved.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launched-double-airstrike-on-nursing-home-in-kursk-oblast-military-claims/	2025-01-12T06:00:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/signal-2025-01-12-154342_003.jpeg
Switzerland ready to host Trump-Putin meeting	Switzerland has expressed its readiness to host a high-level meeting between U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Nicolas Bideau, head of communications at the Swiss Foreign Ministry, told Swiss newspaper Le Temps. According to the publication, Bideau referenced the global peace summit held in Switzerland in June, saying that following the summit, Ukraine, Russia, and the United States have been regularly informed of Switzerland&apos;s willingness to facilitate diplomatic initiatives. &quot;Following the B&#xFC;rgenstock summit, Ukraine, Russia and the United States were regularly informed of our willingness to support diplomatic efforts to find peace,&quot; Bideau said, as quoted by Le Temps. Bideau&#x2019;a address comes as the Kremlin signaled willingness to meet Trump to hammer out a deal on ending Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. No concrete plans or date have been set, though Moscow said any face-to-face meeting would occur only after Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table and swiftly end the full-scale war that nears its third anniversary. Earlier this week, he told reporters that arrangements for a meeting with Putin are underway. The U.S. president-elect also said that specific peace proposals are still being worked out. A pitch leaked from Trump&apos;s team &#x2014; freezing the front lines, postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2014; has already been rejected by Russia. However, one obstacle to a Trump-Putin meeting could be an arrest warrant that the International Criminal Court issued for Putin in March 2023, for allegedly overseeing the forced deportations of Ukrainian children to Russia. According to the Ukrainian national database, Russia has forcibly deported over 19,500 Ukrainian children since the start of the full-scale war. Less than 400 have been brought back to Ukraine. As a signatory to the Rome Statute, Switzerland is legally required to arrest Putin. According to Le Temps, Bideau said the Federal Council has the authority to grant exceptions in situations involving peace negotiations. The push for peace talks comes as both Kyiv and Moscow face mounting challenges connected to the ongoing war. Ukrainian forces struggle to hold back Russia&apos;s advance in the east due to manpower shortages while the future of Western support grows uncertain under Trump. Chances of retaking the fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory that Russia occupies appear increasingly slim, at least in the foreseeable future. In turn, Russia is grappling with soaring inflation caused by record military spending, and its casualties are believed to range between 600,000-800,000 dead and wounded, exceeding all of Moscow&apos;s post-World War II conflicts combined.	https://kyivindependent.com/switzerland-ready-to-host-trump-putin-meeting/	2025-01-12T03:34:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1152488863.jpg
Over 130 people, including 12 children, evacuated from Donetsk Oblast on Jan. 11	Over the past day, 132 people, including 12 children, were evacuated from the front-line area of Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on the morning of Jan. 12. Amid fierce Russian offensives and daily attacks on the area, Donetsk Oblast authorities intensified evacuation efforts during the summer and autumn, with police, military, and volunteers helping civilians flee the region. However, despite calls from officials, as of early January, around 307,000 civilians reportedly remained in Ukrainian-controlled parts of Donetsk Oblast. According to Filashkin, Russian troops shelled the settlements of Donetsk Oblast 20 times over the past day, killing one person in the village of Hryshyne, not far from Pokrovsk. Five people were injured in the village of Bilytske and two more in Kostiantynivka, Filashkin wrote on Facebook. The aftermath of Russian attacks on Donetsk Oblast on Jan. 11.

Ukraine downs 60 Russian drones overnight, Air Force reports	Ukrainian forces shot down 60 Russian attack drones overnight, the Air Force reported on the morning of Jan. 12. Russia launched a total of 94 Shahed-type and decoy drones from the areas of its Millerovo, Oryol, Bryansk, and Kursk, according to the report. The Air Force said it also lost track of the 34 decoy drones that Russia launched alongside the attack ones. The drones were shot down over Poltava, Sumy, Kharkiv, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia, Kirovohrad, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, and Donetsk oblasts. Falling debris from downed drones caused damage to several residential houses in Kharkiv, Sumy, and Poltava regions, the Air Force said. However, there were no casualties. Russian drone attacks across Ukraine surged to record levels in the last months of 2024, with Moscow aiming to ramp up UAV production in the new year. Drone strikes have targeted Ukrainian residential neighborhoods and critical energy infrastructure. On Dec. 29, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia has escalated its aerial assault on Ukraine, launching more than 280 glide bombs, nearly 370 attack drones, and over 80 missiles in the past week. &quot;Our cities and communities are under constant Russian attacks. Even on Christmas night, Russia organized a massive air attack,&quot; Zelensky wrote on Telegram, sharing footage of the destruction across Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-downs-60-russian-drones-overnight-air-force-reports/	2025-01-12T00:27:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183433232.jpg

Transnistria eases blackouts amid gas shortage	Authorities in Moldova&apos;s Russian-controlled region of Transnistria announced on Jan. 11 that energy-saving measures have allowed them to ease restrictions caused by a halt of Russian gas supplies. The duration of rolling blackouts is set to decrease further. Moldova&apos;s pro-European central government said Moscow is responsible for the energy crisis. Transnistria, a Russian-occupied region since the Soviet Union&apos;s collapse, has historically relied on Russian gas transported via Ukraine. The region has faced industrial collapse due to widespread power outages and heating failures. The Russian state energy company Gazprom halted gas deliveries to Moldova on Jan. 1, as Ukraine declined to extend a gas transit agreement into 2025, triggering an energy emergency in the Russian-occupied region. The self-proclaimed authorities in Transnistria never paid Gazprom for the gas they consumed, while Moscow continued to charge Moldova for it. Chisinau refused to cover the cost. Transnistria&apos;s Russian-installed officials reported on the region&apos;s Telegram channel that rolling blackouts, initially lasting eight hours earlier this week, were cut to five hours on Jan. 10 and would be reduced to three hours on Sunday. First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Obolonik said: &quot;With current super efficiencies in consumption, Transnistria has enough gas until the end of January.&quot; To manage the shortages, many factories have shifted to night shifts to reduce grid strain. However, a cement factory in Rybnitsa has shut down, along with a critical steel mill in another city, according to Reuters. Russian gas to Transnistria powers a thermal plant that supplies electricity to the separatist region and much of Moldova&apos;s government-controlled areas. Daniel Voda, press secretary for Moldova&apos;s central government, criticized Moscow&apos;s role in the crisis, adding that Russia uses energy as a political weapon. &quot;Every time that Russia wants to show its might, it cuts off vital resources and turns people into hostages,&quot; Voda reportedly said. &quot;This is an experiment using people that shows that Moscow is not worried about residents&#x2019; comfort and security. ... No one deserves to live in fear and in the cold.&quot; Although the Moldovan government has offered assistance to help Transnistria address its energy shortages, the region&apos;s leadership denies receiving any formal proposals.	https://kyivindependent.com/transnistria-eases-blackouts-amid-gas-shortage/	2025-01-11T20:40:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1247343791.jpg
Russia condemns new US sanctions on energy sector, says it will continue oil and gas projects	Russia criticized the latest U.S. sanctions targeting its energy sector on Jan. 11, describing them as an effort to harm Russia&apos;s economy while risking instability in global markets. Despite this, the country&apos;s Foreign Ministry said Russia would continue pursuing major oil and gas projects. The ministry condemned Washington&apos;s &quot;hostile&quot; actions, announced on Jan. 10, and noted that Russia would craft its foreign policy strategy in response. The ministry argued the sanctions represented &quot;an attempt to inflict at least some damage to the Russian economy, even at the cost of the risk of destabilising world markets as the end approaches of President Joe Biden&apos;s inglorious tenure in power.&quot; The sanctions mark the most extensive U.S. measures yet against Russia&apos;s oil and gas revenue streams. They aim to provide Kyiv and the incoming administration of Donald Trump with leverage to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned Gazprom Neft, Surgutneftegas, and 183 vessels involved in transporting Russian oil, many of which belong to the so-called shadow fleet of aging tankers operated by non-Western companies. Combined, Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas reportedly produce over 1 million barrels of oil daily, generating an estimated $23 billion of revenue annually, according to the U.S. Treasury. President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the sanctions, saying they would &quot;deliver a significant blow&quot; to Russia. &quot;The less revenue Russia earns from oil ... the sooner peace will be restored,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-condemns-new-us-sanctions-on-energy-sector-says-it-will-continue-oil-and-gas-projects/	2025-01-11T17:46:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1601789399.jpg
EU to start drafting new sanctions against Russia next week, media reports	The European Commission plans to begin drafting new sanctions against Russia next week, with the goal of approving the package on Feb. 24 &#x2014; the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Polish RMF FM reports. Starting Jan. 14, the European Commission will hold consultations with EU member states on the 16th sanctions package, according to European diplomats. During these discussions, EU ambassadors will share their proposals and address concerns related to the upcoming measures. Once this process is complete, the European Commission will present its own proposals, which require unanimous support from all EU countries. Poland, currently holding the EU presidency, is pushing for the sanctions package to be finalized by the war&apos;s anniversary on Feb. 24. Slovakia and Hungary are likely to oppose the new sanctions package, complicating the process, according to the outlet. The EU approved its 15th package against Moscow on Dec. 16. That package targeted 54 individuals and 30 organizations from Russia, China, and North Korea as well as shipping companies helping Russia to sell its crude oil, filling Moscow&apos;s coffers amid the full-scale war. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-to-start-drafting-new-sanctions-against-russia-next-week-media-reports/	2025-01-11T15:56:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1882258789.jpg
Ukrainian drone hits large oil refinery in Russia’s Tatarstan, head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation confirms	A Ukrainian drone hit the Taneko oil refinery in Tatarstan, Russian Telegram channel ASTRA reported on Jan. 11. The refinery is one of the country&apos;s largest oil-processing facilities. Workers at the refinery in Nizhnekamsk were evacuated amid the attack, and local footage showed smoke rising from the site. Andrii Kovalenko, Head of Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation, confirmed the strike, and emphasized its strategic importance. &quot;The refinery plays a key role in providing fuel to the Russian military. Taking out refineries and oil depots directly affects Russia&apos;s ability to wage an intensive war,&quot; he said. The refinery, which processes over 16 million tons of oil annually, was previously targeted in a drone attack in spring 2024, causing damage to its primary processing unit. Taneko refinery is located in the city of Nizhnekamsk, around 1,300 kilometers from the country&apos;s border with Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drone-hits-large-oil-refinery-in-russias-tatarstan-head-of-ukraines-center-for-countering-disinformation-confirms/	2025-01-11T13:11:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/astra.jpg
Fico accuses Zelensky of 'begging' and 'blackmailing' European leaders for support	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico called Ukraine an unreliable partner and accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of blackmailing European leaders for support at a parliamentary meeting on Jan. 10. &quot;He [Zelensky] goes around Europe, just begging and blackmailing others, asking for money,&#x201D; he said. Fico posted a video from the meeting on his Facebook page afterward, with some of his quotes. The meeting, convened by the opposition, sought explanations for Fico&#x2019;s recent meeting with Vladimir Putin in Moscow and questioned Slovakia&#x2019;s future energy policies. Fico claimed that Zelensky disrupted a gas transit agreement between Russia and Azerbaijan that would have benefited Slovakia. Kyiv terminated Russian gas transit on Jan. 1, citing its refusal to finance Russia&#x2019;s war. Slovakia, which had previously imported Russian gas through Ukraine, has voiced concerns over the decision&apos;s economic impact. Fico said that Slovakia could halt its humanitarian aid to Ukraine, cut or cancel social benefits for Ukrainian refugees, and cease emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine. He also suggested using Slovakia&apos;s veto power over EU decisions as leverage against Kyiv. &quot;It just has to stop,&quot; he said, and added that he was sometimes &quot;fed up with&#x201D; Zelensky. Fico then described Russia as a reliable energy partner, stating, &quot;Russia has never deceived us, unlike Ukraine.&quot; He also recalled a 2009 incident where he claimed Ukraine&#x2019;s leadership refused to supply Slovakia with gas during a crisis, referring to it as &quot;typical Ukrainians.&quot; Fico met with Putin at the Kremlin during a visit on Dec. 22 to discuss gas supplies. The visit by the Russian-friendly leader was heavily criticized by EU and Ukrainian officials.	https://kyivindependent.com/fico-accuses-zelensky-of-begging-and-blackmailing-european-leaders-for-support/	2025-01-11T11:04:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190743977.jpg
Taliban-led Afghanistan became leading purchaser of Russian flour in 2024	Afghanistan became the largest importer of Russian flour in 2024, Russia&apos;s state agricultural export agency Agroexport reported on Jan. 10. The purchases doubled, compared to the previous year, to nearly $80 million. This surge aligns with Russia&#x2019;s efforts to strengthen ties with the Taliban government, including recent steps toward officially recognizing the regime. Afghanistan depends on imported flour due to limited domestic production capacity. Russia&#x2019;s overall flour exports reached $300 million in 2024, with China and Turkmenistan also among the top buyers. Russia has maintained contact with the Taliban-ruled Afghanistan without officially recognizing the new authorities. Russia&apos;s Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu visited Afghanistan on Nov. 25, saying that the removal of the Taliban from the list of terrorist groups is in its &quot;final stage.&quot; &quot;Let me confirm our readiness to establish a constructive political dialogue between our countries and among the goals would be providing an impulse for the process of a settlement among Afghans,&quot; Shoigu reportedly said. &quot;We have tried to ensure conditions for a growth in exports of Afghan goods and a growth in foreign investment.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/taliban-led-afghanistan-became-leading-purchaser-of-russian-flour-in-2024/	2025-01-11T10:18:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1233884544.jpg
41-year-old Latvian volunteer soldier killed in Luhansk Oblast on Christmas	Edgars Platonovs, a 41-year-old Latvian volunteer soldier fighting for Ukraine, was killed in action in December on the eastern front, the Latvian Armed Forces reported on Jan. 10. Platonovs was fighting in the areas near the village of Novoiehorivka in the largely Russian-occupied Luhansk Oblast as part of the Ukrainian military&apos;s International Legion, composed of mostly foreign volunteers, according to the Latvian Armed Forces. The military said that the volunteer was killed on Dec. 25, 2024. Platonovs&apos; death is among the huge costs that Ukraine and those helping the country have had to pay to fend off the relentless Russian offensives since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Many foreign fighters &#x2013;&#xA0;like Platonovs &#x2013; were killed and wounded in Ukraine, but Kyiv has not disclosed the casualty figures. &quot;Another of our volunteer soldiers has died defending the freedom and independence of Ukraine. Our deepest condolences to the relatives and comrades of Edgars Platonovs,&quot; Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics said on social media platform X, adding: &quot;Eternal memory to the hero!&quot; Unlike many other foreign volunteers, Platonovs had not served in the Latvian Armed Forces before arriving in Ukraine. His family praised him as a &quot;loving son, our older, strong and caring brother, who always did everything with all his heart and conviction,&quot; as cited by Delfi news website. &quot;Edgars was a kind, sincere and always positive person who never lost faith in himself and his principles,&quot; his family said, according to Delfi. Earlier in October 2023, a Russian drone attack had killed another Lithuanian &#x2013; 28-year-old Vitalijs Smirnovs &#x2013; in the Lyman area of Donetsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/41-year-old-latvian-volunteer-soldier-killed-in-luhansk-oblast-on-christmas/	2025-01-11T07:58:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Latvia-1.jpeg
West must show Putin that 'Russia is no longer an empire,' Boris Johnson says	The West must get it across to Vladimir Putin that Russia is no longer an empire, former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in an online interview with Delfi published on Jan. 10, calling the Russian leader a &quot;f***ing idiot.&quot; Johnson made a parallel to the British Empire, saying that though almost nothing is left of the once-greatest empire in the world, the U.K. is content in its post-imperialist role. Talking in the context of Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, the ex-prime minister called for Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO and criticized the alliance&apos;s &quot;chronically ambiguous&quot; approach toward Kyiv. In office between 2019 and 2022, Johnson was one of the staunchest supporters of Ukraine at the onset of the full-scale invasion, visiting the country several times during the war. The former head of the British government told the Baltic news outlet that Russia&apos;s war is &quot;archaic and barbaric&quot; and that Moscow needs to learn that Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and other countries are also not part of the Russian empire anymore. As Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion nears its third anniversary, Russian forces continue to occupy roughly 20% of Ukraine&apos;s sovereign territory. Moscow illegally declared the annexation of four partially occupied regions in September 2022, in addition to Ukraine&apos;s Crimean Peninsula seized in 2014.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-must-understand-that-russia-is-no-longer-an-empire-boris-johnson-says/	2025-01-11T07:46:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2184238205.jpg
Ukraine mulls buying Italian air defenses with frozen Russian assets' proceeds	Kyiv and Rome are discussing the possibility of purchasing Italian-made air defense systems and ammunition using profits from immobilized Russian assets, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said on Jan. 11. &quot;We are interested, among other things, in ammunition of various calibers and air defense systems,&quot; Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Anatolii Klochko said after talks with Italian defense officials. Italy delivered a highly advanced SAMP/T system to Ukraine in cooperation with France in 2023. The second system was said to have been in late September 2024. Last December, the Italian government approved a decree extending Italy&apos;s military support for Ukraine through the year 2025. The Western countries and other partners immobilized around $300 billion in sovereign Russian assets placed in their bank accounts at the start of the full-scale war. While Kyiv called for the full confiscation of these funds, the G7 has instead announced a $50 billion loan for Ukraine that will be paid back through profits generated by the frozen assets. The funds will be used for the country&apos;s reconstruction and military needs. The scheme allows Ukraine to obtain arms without relying on Western donations or further straining its already tight budget.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-wants-to-buy-italian-air-defenses-with-russian-frozen-asset-proceeds/	2025-01-11T05:59:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/whatsapp-image-2025-01-11-at-10-25-46-95670da282.webp
Ukraine captures 2 North Korean soldiers in Russia's Kursk Oblast, Zelensky says	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. Ukrainian troops captured two North Korean soldiers as prisoners of war (POWs) in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 11. &quot;This task was not easy,&quot; he said in a Telegram post. &quot;Usually, Russia and other North Korean military personnel finish off their wounded and do everything possible to ensure that no evidence of the participation of another state &#x2013; North Korea &#x2013; in the war against Ukraine is preserved.&quot; The two wounded soldiers received necessary medical care and are in the custody of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) in Kyiv, according to Zelensky. The president applauded Ukrainian paratroopers and soldiers from the Special Operation Forces for capturing the North Koreans. North Korea deployed around 12,000 soldiers in Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion in August to bring the war to Russia, a senior Ukrainian official familiar with the intelligence told the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-captured-2-north-korean-soldiers-as-pows-in-russias-kursk-oblast-zelensky-says/	2025-01-11T04:11:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-11_13-23-34.jpg
Putin to push for barring Ukraine's NATO accession in expected talks with Trump, FT reports	Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s main goals in any peace negotiations include prohibiting Ukraine from ever entering NATO and reducing allied military presence in the eastern flank, the Financial Times reported on Jan. 10, citing a former Kremlin official and a source who discussed the matter with Putin. The news comes as the Kremlin signaled willingness to meet U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to hammer out a deal on ending Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. No concrete plans or date have been set, though Moscow said any face-to-face meeting would occur only after Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table and swiftly end the full-scale war that nears its third anniversary. Earlier this week, he told reporters that arrangements for a meeting with Putin are underway. The U.S. president-elect said previously that specific peace proposals are still being worked out. A pitch leaked from Trump&apos;s team &#x2014; freezing the front lines, postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2014; has already been rejected by Russia. Trump&apos;s incoming peace envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said that the president-elect&apos;s aim is not to &quot;give something to Putin or the Russians&quot; but to &quot;save Ukraine and save their sovereignty.&quot; Nevertheless, Trump has often voiced sympathies for the Russian leader, prompting fears he might cut a deal unfavorable to Ukraine. Putin&apos;s two reported main goals mirror demands raised by Moscow shortly before the start of the full-scale invasion. The Biden administration and NATO allies rejected the demands at the time. Ukraine has ramped up its efforts to join the alliance after the outbreak of the full-scale war, calling in the best possible guarantee that Russia will not resume its aggression in the future. President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested that Ukraine could enter NATO gradually, with the collective defense principle initially not extending to occupied territories. The push for peace talks comes as both Kyiv and Moscow face mounting challenges connected to the ongoing war. Ukrainian forces struggle to hold back Russia&apos;s advance in the east due to manpower shortages while the future of Western support grows uncertain under Trump. Chances of retaking the fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory that Russia occupies appear increasingly slim, at least in the foreseeable future. In turn, Russia grapples with soaring inflation caused by record military spending, and its casualties are believed to range between 600,000-800,000 dead and wounded, outpacing all of Moscow&apos;s post-World War II conflicts combined.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-to-push-for-barring-ukraines-nato-accession-in-potential-talks-with-trump-ft-reports/	2025-01-11T04:01:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1229490488.jpg
Germany towing disabled tanker from Russia's 'shadow fleet' in Baltic Sea	Germany said on Jan. 11 that it had established towing connections with a disabled tanker Eventin, which it said was part of Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; used to avert sanctions, to prevent an oil spill in the Baltic Sea. &quot;The towing convoy is moving eastwards to a position northeast of Cape Arkona (R&#xFC;gen),&quot; Germany&apos;s Central Command for Maritime Emergencies (CCME) said, referring to the German island in the southwestern part of the Baltic Sea. &quot;The emergency command is continuously assessing the situation in order to be able to react to any changes,&quot; the command said, adding that the towing convoy is moving at the speed of 2.5 kilometers per hour, navigating through strong winds. Russia has used murky ships for oil exports to circumvent sanctions imposed by Western nations for waging its brutal war against Ukraine. The Panamanian-flagged tanker, loaded with about 99,000 tons of oil, was sailing from Russia to Egypt, according to the CCME. The tanker was unable to maneuver since Jan. 10 and has been slowly drifting in the Baltic Sea coastal waters, north of R&#xFC;gen, the CCME said in its daily updates. Speaking to the press on Jan. 10, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock slammed Russia for threatening European security with its use of &quot;dilapidated oil tankers,&quot; AFP reported. &quot;By ruthlessly deploying a fleet of rusty tankers, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is not only circumventing the sanctions, but is also willingly accepting that tourism on the Baltic Sea will come to a standstill&quot; if an accident occurs, Baerbock said, as cited by AFP. The reports of the stricken vessel come a month after two Russian tankers were damaged by a storm in December in the Kerch Strait. The vessels, each reportedly carrying 4,000 tons of fuel, began leaking into the Black Sea. Russia has caused massive environmental damage in and outside Ukraine, including the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka Dam in June 2023 and subsequent flooding, widespread forest fires, and the devastation of wide stretches of farmland. Germany said that no oil leaks had been detected after the Jan. 10 incident. By the time of the publication, it was unclear whether there were suspicions of sabotage that may have caused the adrift. &#xA0; &quot;Since Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, the dark fleet of old vessels that lack proper insurance, have opaque ownership, and &apos;flag hop&apos; between different permissive ship registries has grown explosively, to an estimated 1,400 ships,&quot; the U.S.-think tank Atlantic Council wrote in its January 2024 report. &quot;Their presence poses considerable risk to other ships, to the environment, and to countries experiencing maritime accidents caused by the vessels,&quot; it added.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-towing-shadow-fleet-tanker/	2025-01-11T03:30:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192693454.jpg
Police dismantle almost 50 illegal border crossing schemes in massive crackdown	The Ukrainian National Police broke up nearly 50 schemes for draft-age Ukrainian men to illegally cross the border, the police said on Jan. 11 after a large-scale operation. The announcement follows 600 simultaneous raids across the country on Jan. 10 aimed at preventing fighting-age men from fleeing abroad. Ukraine prohibits men aged 18-60 from leaving the country under martial law, which was instituted at the outbreak of Russia&apos;s full-scale war in 2022. Sixty suspects were charged in schemes that included crossing the border outside of checkpoints, forging health documents, and inputting falsified entries into an electronic information system, the police said. The defendants included heads of state institutions, hospital managers, military enlistment officers, medical commission officials, and ordinary civilians. According to the statement, men seeking to leave the country paid between $5,000 and $22,000 to the suspects to help them cross the border. The suspects face up to nine years in prison, property confiscation, and a ban on holding certain official positions. The police noted that this concludes the first stage of the operation, as efforts to identify other suspects are underway. Though Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko admitted last June that dozens of men try to illegally cross the border every day, Ukrainian authorities have largely avoided providing exact figures. According to the Romanian police, 11,000 Ukrainian men have illegally crossed the border into Romania between the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and May 2024. As many as 23,500 illegally entered Moldova between February 2022 and last July, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported. Illegal border crossing schemes only deepen the manpower shortages facing the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which then struggle to hold back the Russian advance in Donetsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/police-dismantle-almost-50-illegal-border-crossing-schemes/	2025-01-11T02:49:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/15d5fb17d4c126d08e08ecb6d52de769.jpg
Norway to build bomb shelters amid growing threat from Russia	Norway proposed on Jan. 10 to build new bomb shelters and over 100 other measures to bolster civil preparedness amid Russian aggression in Ukraine and rising global security challenges. Russia&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine and its increasingly belligerent rhetoric toward the West prompted warnings across NATO about a possible clash with Moscow in the coming years. NATO member Norway shares a 200-kilometer-long (over 120 miles) border with Russia in the Arctic Circle. Norway&apos;s new total preparedness report instructs the government to ask the parliament to repeal a 1998 decision to halt the construction of bomb shelters and construct new ones. The new shelters will be built in complexes larger than 1,000 square meters. Some will be designed to withstand conventional attacks, while others should protect the population against radioactive or chemical weapons. The government will also increase the number of Civil Defense conscripts from 8,000 to 12,000 over the next eight years, set up emergency food storages to last three months, propose compulsory civilian service during a security crisis or war, and draft preparedness plans and strategies. The report was compiled in a &quot;serious security situation characterized by Russia&apos;s war of aggression against Ukraine, the war in the Middle East, and the global competition between great powers over military, political, economic, and technological dominance,&quot; the Norwegian government said in a statement. &quot;This is a turning point for Norway&apos;s total civil preparedness. We are leaving behind the period we had lived in since the 1990s after the fall of the (Berlin) Wall when the preparedness was based on stable peace,&quot; Justice Minister Emile Enger Mehl said. &quot;Going forward, we must prepare for a new era.&quot; Other countries in Russia&apos;s vicinity have moved to bolster their preparedness in the event of a conflict. Lithuania drafted evacuation plans to relocate a quarter of its population in the case of war. In light of Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, civil preparedness measures have been under review also in Latvia and Estonia.	https://kyivindependent.com/norway-to-build-bomb-shelters-amid-russias-threat/	2025-01-11T02:00:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1238737954.jpg
Ukraine's Legion in Poland has received 1,300 applications; first women join the unit	Almost 1,300 Ukrainians living in Poland, Denmark, Czechia, Germany, Lithuania, and other European countries have applied to join the Poland-based Ukrainian Legion, the Defense Ministry said on Jan. 10. The legion was unveiled in July 2024 as a volunteer military unit made up of Ukrainians living in Poland and trained by the Polish Armed Forces. The first volunteer recruitment center was opened last October at the Ukrainian consulate in the eastern Polish city of Lublin. The ministry announced on Jan. 10 that the second group of volunteers had already signed contracts in Lublin. For the first time, the new recruits included women who applied for medical and communications roles. &quot;Today, we accepted more recruits into the unit&apos;s ranks than in November,&quot; said Lieutenant Colonel Petro Pokrusha, a representative of the legion&apos;s command. &quot;This shows the growing confidence of our citizens in this initiative.&quot; The ministry has not revealed the number of contracts concluded so far. After signing their contracts, new volunteers began training at the Polish Armed Forces&apos; facilities under Polish instructors and using modern NATO weaponry. The legion was launched as a way to engage Ukrainians living abroad in Ukraine&apos;s defense against Russia&apos;s invasion amid increasingly critical manpower shortages. The legion will allow Ukrainians to join the fight while being able to return to their place of residence abroad after completing their service. Under martial law instituted in 2022 after the start of the full-scale war, Ukrainian men aged 18-60 are not permitted to leave Ukraine without permission. The U.N. estimates that 6.7 million Ukrainians were driven abroad as a result of Russia&apos;s all-out invasion. This is in addition to a sizeable diaspora living in Europe, the U.S., Canada, and elsewhere since before 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-legion-in-poland-has-received-1-300-applications/	2025-01-11T01:12:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1659460683.jpg
Russia claims it downed 85 Ukrainian drones; 2 apartment buildings reportedly damaged	The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 11 that its air defense had intercepted or destroyed 85 Ukrainian drones flying into Russia overnight. In one of the regions that Moscow claimed it successfully countered a Ukrainian drone attack, the local authorities said that a drone crashed into two five-floor apartment buildings in the town of Kotovsk in western Russia. The damage was minimal, but three people were lightly injured by broken glass, according to Tambov Oblast Governor Yevgeny Pervyshov. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify all of the claims. Using its homemade drones, Ukraine has targeted military sites, airfields, and oil refineries deep in Russia to counter a much larger foe by trying to disrupt logistics in the rear. The Ukrainian side rarely reveals information about its attacks in Russia, making it difficult to assess the scale of the attacks. Footage that purports to show the aftermath of a drone crashing into a apartment building in Kotovsk, Tambov Oblast, Russia, overnight on Jan. 11, 2025. (Astra/Telegram)The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that 31 drones were destroyed over the Black Sea, 16 over Voronezh Oblast and Krasnodar Krai, 14 over the Azov Sea, four over Belgorod Oblast, two over Tambov Oblast, one over Kursk Oblast, and one over the Russian-occupied Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. The intense Ukrainian long-range drone attacks over 2024 showed Russian air defense vulnerabilities. &quot;From what we can tell &#x2014; it&apos;s no longer a secret &#x2014; Ukrainian long-range unmanned aerial vehicles can hypothetically operate up to 2,000 kilometers,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) spokesperson Andrii Yusov said on Dec. 27, 2024. In turn, Russia regularly targets Ukrainian cities, villages, and infrastructure with drones and missiles, often resulting in civilian casualties. Two civilians were killed and 12 injured over the past day, Ukrainian authorities said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-it-downed-85-ukrainian-drones-flying-in-overnight/	2025-01-11T00:46:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Gg_iV2UWgAAwV8Z.jpeg
US Congress should ensure that Ukraine aid continues even under Trump, Biden says	Outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden said on Jan. 10 he did all he could to help Ukraine and voiced hope that U.S. support will continue even after he leaves office. &quot;There is a significant number of Democrats and Republicans on the (Capitol) Hill who think we should continue to support Ukraine,&quot; Biden said during his remarks on the state of the U.S. economy. &quot;It is my hope and expectation they&apos;ll speak up and not agree to if president... if (U.S. President-elect Donald) Trump decides to cut off funding for Ukraine.&quot; Trump is set to return to the White House on Jan. 20. His reelection sparked concern about the future of U.S. support for Ukraine as the president-elect has repeatedly criticized the Biden administration over funneling assistance to the embattled country. After his reelection, Trump hinted at a possible reduction of U.S. assistance but said he would not &quot;abandon&quot; Ukraine, aiming to use the support instead as leverage to push for quicker peace talks. Biden said that during his time in office, he did &quot;everything (he) possibly could&quot; to &quot;give Ukraine every advantage it could have&quot; to defend its independence. Under Biden, Washington became the leader of the pro-Kyiv coalition, though the president has often been criticized for a supposedly self-restrictive and hesitant approach. The Biden administration has allocated over $170 billion in assistance to Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, providing more than $60 billion in military aid. Earlier this week, the U.S. announced a $500 million military assistance package for Ukraine and the largest yet package of sanctions against the Russian oil industry. When asked how long Ukraine can hold if Trump cuts aid, Biden voiced his conviction that as long as the European partners remain united, &quot;there is a real chance that the Ukrainians can prevail because the cost to Russia is incredibly high, over 600,000 dead or wounded.&quot; Biden added that Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;has his own problems economically... as well as politically at home.&quot; The Biden administration said it would seek to aid Ukraine as much as it can in its last months and weeks in office to put the country in the strongest possible negotiating position.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-congress-should-ensure-that-ukraine-aid-continues-even-under-trump-biden-says/	2025-01-11T00:24:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193176681.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure 12 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least two civilians and injured at least 12 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 11. Russia launched 74 Shahed-type attack drones and dummy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Forty-seven drones were shot down over 11 oblasts, while 27 dummy drones were lost in the airspace, according to the statement. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, three people were injured in Russian attacks over the past day, Governor Serhii Lysak said. Two men aged 46 and 74 were injured during drone and artillery attacks against the Nikopol district on Jan. 10. Overnight, a 40-year-old man was injured in the same district, the governor said. A civilian was killed and another injured during a Russian attack against the front-line town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Kherson Oblast, two people were injured as a result of Russian strikes, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. Twenty-one houses were damaged. One person was killed and six injured during Russian attacks on Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. A 39-year-old man and a 56-year-old woman were hospitalized following a Russian attack on the city of Zaporizhzhia on the evening of Jan. 10. On the morning of the following day, a Russian drone hit a car in the village of Primorske, killing a &#xA0;47-year-old woman and injuring two men aged 46 and 60 and two women aged 49 and 52, Fedorov reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-117/	2025-01-10T23:36:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-11_07-30-05.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 806,500 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 806,500 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 11. This number includes 1,570 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,751 tanks, 20,271 armored fighting vehicles, 33,534 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,817 artillery systems, 1,260 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,042 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 21,958 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-806-500-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-10T23:30:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192142645.jpg
NATO won't endorse Trump's 5% spending target, but ready for increase, Reuters reports	NATO allies are unlikely to meet U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s proposed spending target of 5% of GDP but are open to an increase from the current 2%, Reuters reported on Jan. 10, citing comments from officials and analysts from various NATO countries. On Jan. 7, Trump called for an increase to the NATO spending target to 5% of GDP, up from NATO&apos;s current target of 2%. Other NATO allies have urged increased spending in response to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;I think NATO should have 5%,&quot; Trump said at a news conference in Florida, confirming earlier reports about the incoming U.S. president urging allies to raise defense spending to a benchmark no NATO member has reached as of now, including the U.S. While many NATO members are not open to a 5% spending target, some many NATO allies are open to increasing the spending target to a widely agreed upon target. NATO members may agree to increase the spending target to 3% of GDP, Reuters reported. &quot;It seems there will be a shift... I don&apos;t think it will be 5%, which would be impossible for almost every nation in the world right now but... it will not be two (percent), which we are already struggling to reach, but it will be more than two,&quot; Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto told Reuters. On Dec. 12 the Financial Times reported that European NATO foreign ministers began discussing a plan to gradually increase the alliance&#x2019;s defense spending target from 2% of their GDP to 3% by 2030. According to sources, the alliance&#x2019;s members would first increase their spending to 2.5% of GDP before reaching 3% by 2030. Trump has criticized NATO member states that do not meet the current 2% of GDP spending target. Several NATO allies, including Italy, Canada, and Spain do not meet the current target, though the number of allies that do rose to 24 last year. According to NATO estimates, Poland spent the greatest portion of its GDP on defense (4.12%) in 2024, followed by Estonia (3.43%) and the U.S. (3.38%). In the face of Russia&apos;s war, Ukraine has drastically increased defense spending, despite not being a part of NATO. Ukraine will spend 26% of its GDP on defense spending in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-wont-endorse-trumps-5-spending-target-but-ready-for-increase-reuters-reports/	2025-01-10T21:53:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-996942026-1.jpg
Ukraine's inflation accelerated to 12% in 2024, exceeding government forecasts	Inflation in Ukraine accelerated to 12% in 2024, exceeding forecasts made by the country&apos;s National Bank, Ukraine&apos;s statistics service Derzhstat announced on Jan. 10. The Ukrainian economy has undergone harsh conditions with the onset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Following the start of the invasion, inflation skyrocketed to 26.6% in 2022 from 10.0% in 2021. As Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion continues into its fourth year, inflation has continued to drive up prices for Ukrainians. The accelerated rate surpassed forecasts made by Ukraine&apos;s National Bank in November, which estimated that Ukraine would end 2024 at an annualized 9.7% inflation rate. The main driver for inflation growth in 2024 was the increasing cost of groceries as well as electricity costs. Food prices grew 1.8% in December, down from a yearly high of 3.9% in November, the Ukrainian state registry Derzhstat reported. The price of food and drinks increased 14.1% year over year from December 2023, with vegetables increasing 48.3% in price. Amid Russian attacks on energy infrastructure, electricity costs also increased by a massive 63.6% year over year in December, Derzhstat reported. Ukraine&apos;s National Bank predicted in November that the country&apos;s annual inflation rate will drop to 6.9% in 2025, and return to the bank&apos;s 5% target in 2026. Russia&apos;s invasion caused a major hit to Ukraine&apos;s economy, which suffered a 29.1% fall in GDP in 2022. Since then, the country has made strides in stabilizing the situation, and the GDP is expected to grow by over 4% in 2024 and 2025. Despite the high inflation, Ukraine&apos;s economy has managed to adapt to the realities of the full-scale war as Russia&apos;s economy faces increasingly unfavorable forecasts. Russia faces surging inflation and a falling ruble that forced the central bank to institute a 21% interest rate, the highest level since the early 2000s. The Ukrainian government and economy have been propped up by financial support from Western allies, including military and humanitarian aid as well as loans from frozen Russian assets.	https://kyivindependent.com/inflation-reached-12-in-2024-exceeding-government-forecasts/	2025-01-10T21:16:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1859609907.jpg
Ukraine 'will do everything' it can to obtain security guarantees, end war in 2025, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky said it is Ukraine&apos;s &quot;dream&quot; to end the war in 2025, as the country seeks to obtain security guarantees that would &quot;prevent Russia from returning with aggression,&quot; the president said in a television interview on Jan. 10. &quot;It&apos;s crucial for us that peace comes. We desire peace more than anyone else. And it&apos;s obvious, as we are the ones suffering the most, particularly in terms of lives lost,&quot; Zelensky said in an interview with Italian broadcaster RaiNews24. &quot;It is our dream to obtain these (security) guarantees this year and to end the war this year. We will do everything to achieve this,&quot; Zelensky added. Talk of ending Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has increased as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is poised to take power on Jan. 20. The new administration aims to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine 100 days from inauguration, Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s choice for special Ukraine peace envoy said on Jan. 8. &quot;People need to understand, he&apos;s not trying to give something to Putin or to the Russians, he&apos;s actually trying to save Ukraine and save their sovereignty,&quot; Kellogg said during an interview on Fox News Kellogg did not discuss details of any potential peace agreements under consideration by the incoming administration. Earlier reports from the Wall Street Journal indicated that Trump&#x2019;s team is considering a plan to delay Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for continued Western arms supplies and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire. Trump reportedly discussed with Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron the prospects of European leadership in stopping the war during a visit to Paris in December. Zelensky said on Dec. 9 that Ukraine &quot;may consider&quot; Macron&apos;s proposal to deploy foreign peacekeepers on its territory but only after getting a clear understanding of the NATO membership timeline Before his visit to Italy, Zelensky attended the Ramstein summit in Germany on Jan. 9. At the meeting, several of Ukraine&apos;s allies pledged additional support. Ukrainian diplomats held bilateral meetings with key allies. Zelensky called for increased cooperation between Ukraine and its allies. &quot;It&apos;s clear that a new chapter starts for Europe and the entire world just 11 days from now, when we have to cooperate even more, rely on each other even more, and achieve greater results together,&quot; Zelensky said in his opening address alongside outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius on Jan. 9.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-will-do-anything-to-end-the-war-this-year-zelensky-says/	2025-01-10T19:25:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187689001.jpg
Pro-Russian Bulgarian politician demands return of 'historically Bulgarian' Southern Bessarabia region of Ukraine	Kostadin Kostadinov, leader of Bulgaria&#x2019;s pro-Russian Revival party, has fueled Kremlin narratives by claiming that Southern Bessarabia, part of Ukraine&#x2019;s Odesa Oblast, should be returned to Bulgaria. He stated on his Facebook page that he thinks &#x201C;Ukraine is falling apart&#x201D; and that Bulgarians are the &#x201C;indigenous population&#x201D; of the region, with deeper historical ties than Ukraine, which has controlled it for only 34 years. Kostadinov proposed presenting Bulgaria&#x2019;s claims to &#x201C;Bulgarian Bessarabia&#x201D; at a future peace congress to decide Ukraine&#x2019;s fate. He also called for unification with Macedonia, emphasizing shared history and culture, and compared his proposals to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s remarks about annexing Canada and regaining control of the Panama Canal. &#x201C;There is nothing more logical for two countries with a common history, common origin, common language and common people than to become one country,&#x201D; he wrote. The Ukrainian Embassy in Bulgaria condemned Kostadinov&#x2019;s statements, labeling them a distortion of historical facts that promote border redistribution and violate international law. The embassy urged official condemnation, highlighting the inappropriateness of such rhetoric from a politician in an EU member state. Bulgaria has provided Ukraine with a variety of aid since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, but pro-Russian sentiment has remained strong in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/pro-russian-bulgarian-politician-demands-return-of-historically-bulgarian-southern-bessarabia-region-of-ukraine/	2025-01-10T16:14:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2123616394.jpg
Ukraine and Russia not prepared for peace talks, White House says	U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that neither Russia nor Ukraine is currently prepared for negotiations to end the war, according to his comments at a briefing on Jan. 10. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously suggested that initial talks on resolving the war might involve U.S. President-elect Donald Trump before potentially engaging with Russian President Vladimir Putin. &quot;This (the introduction of sanctions against the Russian Federation) was not done with the expectation that it would become a bargaining chip that could be taken off the table when Ukraine wants to sit down at this negotiating table. There is no expectation now that either side is ready for negotiations,&quot; Kirby said. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry expects a Zelensky and Trump meeting soon after the upcoming inauguration. Also, Kirby stated that recent U.S. sanctions on Russia&apos;s oil sector were not introduced as leverage for future peace talks but were based on energy market forecasts. Kirby noted that earlier large-scale sanctions in this area were delayed to prevent domestic energy price hikes. Outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration plans to introduce a &quot;big package&quot; of sanctions on Russia&#x2019;s shadow fleet and individuals, Reuters reported on Jan. 6, citing sources familiar with the matter. Despite Western efforts to reduce Russia&#x2019;s income from oil funding its war against Ukraine, Moscow has been able to bypass sanctions and sell Russian oil above the imposed price cap of $60 per barrel with the buildup of a fleet of aging vessels with dubious ownership.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-and-russia-not-prepared-for-peace-talks-white-house-says/	2025-01-10T14:15:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2013302423.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukrainian Neptune missile hits Russian drone warehouse in Rostov Oblast, SBU source claims	Key developments on Jan. 10: Ukraine struck a Russian warehouse storing ammunition and reconnaissance drones using a domestically-made Neptune missile overnight on Jan. 10, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. According to the source, the attack near the village of Chaltyr in Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast was carried out by the SBU and Ukraine&apos;s Navy. At first, Ukrainian drones reportedly &quot;overloaded&quot; Russian air defenses, with a Neptune missile hitting the site shortly after, the source said. Videos published on social media show the moment of an explosion in Rostov Oblast and a tall column of smoke rising over the settlement. The extent of the damage was not disclosed. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage purporting to show Ukraine&apos;s attack on a warehouse storing ammunition and reconnaissance drones near the village of Chaltyr in Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast overnight on Jan. 10. (Social media)Earlier on Jan. 10, local authorities and Russian independent media reported that Ukrainian drones had attacked several Russian oblasts overnight, causing severe fires in Leningrad and Rostov oblasts. Neptune is Ukraine&#x2019;s ground-launched, domestically produced anti-ship rocket with a maximum range of 300 kilometers. Ukrainian forces reportedly used Neptune missiles to destroy a Russian S-400 Triumph air defense system on Sept. 14 and sink Russia&#x2019;s Black Sea flagship Moskva in April 2022. The attack is one of several recent strikes in Rostov Oblast. On Dec. 25, Ukrainian long-range drones targeted an ammunition depot at the Kadamovsky military training ground, a source in the SBU told the Kyiv Independent. A day later, Ukraine&apos;s Center for Strategic Communications (Stratcom) reported that the Armed Forces struck a plant in Rostov Oblast, that produces solid propellant for ballistic missiles. Ukrainian forces struck a Russian army command post in Svitlodarsk in Russian-occupied Donetsk Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 10. In a post on Facebook, the military said the &quot;successful hit&quot; targeted Russia&apos;s 3rd Army Corps. Svitlodarsk is located around 30 kilometers southeast of Bakhmut, and was occupied by Russian forces in May 2022. The General Staff did not specify what weapon was used in the attack or the extent of the damage inflicted, but said &quot;all necessary measures were taken to limit the risk to civilians.&quot; Ukraine fields homemade missiles and long-range drones as well as Western-supplied arms like HIMARS, ATACMS, or Storm Shadow missiles. &quot;This week in the Donetsk region the Armed Forces of Ukraine has conducted a series of strikes on facilities seized by Russian invaders,&quot; the General Staff added. This is the second such reported strike this week &#x2014; on Jan. 8 the General Staff said Ukrainian forces carried out a precision strike against a command post of Russia&apos;s 8th Combined Arms Army in Russian-occupied Khartsyzk in Donetsk Oblast. Similar attacks were also reported in recent days, including a precision strike against a Russian command post in Kursk Oblast on Jan. 7 and another one in the same region on Jan. 2. Earlier on Jan. 8, the Ukrainian military announced a successful long-range attack against a Russian oil depot in Saratov Oblast that provided fuel to the nearby Engels-2 airbase. Ukrainian troops are holding defensive lines at the Kurakhove thermal power plant despite fierce fighting in the sector, Khortytsia group of forces spokesperson Viktor Trehubov said on national television on Jan. 10. &quot;Now the Russians are trying to attack in the area of Dachne, and drive Ukrainian forces out of Kurakhove. Ukrainian forces are holding the thermal power plant and inflicting all the damage they can on the enemy,&quot; Trehubov said. Kurakhove has become one of the focal points of the Russian offensive in Donetsk Oblast over the past few months, turning the town into one of the hottest sectors of the front. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 6 that its forces had fully captured Kurakhove in, a statement not confirmed at the time by Ukraine. On Jan. 7, a military spokesperson said Ukrainian forces continue to hold positions in the western outskirts of Kurakhove and the power plant, but the situation in the town is &quot;difficult.&quot; The town lies over 20 kilometers (over 10 miles) north of Russian-occupied Vuhledar and over 30 kilometers (almost 20 miles) south of the key front-line town of Pokrovsk. The estimated Russian advance in the Kurakhove sector of Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 10, 2025, according to the DeepState monitoring group. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Ukrainian troops are destroying large amounts of Russian military equipment in the Kurakhove sector, Trehubov added. Ukrainian Armed Forces repelled 29 Russian attacks in the Kurakhove sector near Sribne, Andriivka, Petropavlivka, Kurakhove, and Dachne over the past day, the General Staff reported earlier in the day. Following the capture of Mariinka in early 2024, the Russian army intensified its advance toward Kurakhove. Street fighting is currently taking place in the town. Russian forces had earlier blown up the dam of the Kurakhove Reservoir, a hydraulic structure near the village of Stari Terny in the Kurakhove community. The thermal power plant in Kurakhove, for which the damaged reservoir was created, is not operating. The industrial facility has now become a fortification, and the scene of intense urban fighting in Kurakhove. If taken, Kurakhove would be the first significant town to fall into Russian hands in 2025 after Russia took Avdiivka and Vuhledar last year. Moscow&apos;s troops are also focusing their efforts on Pokrovsk, an important logistics hub, as part of their overall goal to capture the entire Donetsk Oblast. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has blocked a proposal for an additional military aid package for Ukraine worth 3 billion euros ($3.09 billion), Spiegel reported on Jan. 9, citing its undisclosed sources. Under Scholz&apos;s leadership, Germany has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. The chancellor has nevertheless often been criticized for his cautious approach on some key issues, such as his refusal to provide Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine. The new assistance plan, proposed by German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, was for additional weapons including three additional Iris-T air defense batteries, 10 howitzers, and more artillery ammunition, acording to Spiegel. But Scholz claimed the existing allocation of 4 billion euros ($4.1 billion) for 2025, as well as funds from the $50 billion G7 loan financed by frozen Russian assets, should be sufficient, Spiegel reported. Scholz also expressed concern that the new government could take on significant financial obligations after early federal elections in February if the package was allowed to go ahead. Baerbock and Pistorius justified the need for the package by arguing that the combat situation in Ukraine was worsening, and that there was uncertainty about further U.S. support under Donald Trump&apos;s leadership. Pistorius and Baerbock hoped to gain parliamentary support for their proposal before the federal elections, and presented their proposal as &quot;a vital signal of Germany&apos;s unwavering support.&quot; Despite Scholz&apos;s lack of support, Pistorius reiterated Germany&apos;s support during a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, also known as Ramstein, on Jan. 9, according to Spiegel. Pistorius announced the provision of nearly 50 guided missiles for the Iris-T air defense system. The missiles, originally designed for the Bundeswehr, were redirected directly from production to Ukraine. The U.S. and the U.K. have enacted their most extensive sanctions against Russia&apos;s oil industry, targeting nearly 200 vessels of the so-called &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; major oil companies, and associated entities, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced on Jan. 10. &quot;The United States is taking sweeping action against Russia&apos;s key source of revenue for funding its brutal and illegal war against Ukraine,&quot; Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. The sanctions include more than 180 oil-carrying vessels of Russia&apos;s so-called shadow fleet, a group of tankers routinely used for sanction evasion. Several of these vessels are also reportedly involved in transporting sanctioned Iranian oil. The measures also target two of Russia&apos;s major oil producers, Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegaz, along with dozens of their subsidiaries. Combined, these companies reportedly produce over 1 million barrels of oil daily, generating an estimated $23 billion of revenue annually, according to the U.S. Treasury. The sanctions also extend to dozens of Russian energy officials and corporate executives, further tightening restrictions on Moscow&apos;s oil industry. In addition to sanctions, Ukraine has disrupted Russia&apos;s oil production with targeted drone strikes on infrastructure. Refineries in Tuapse, Ilyich, and Novoshakhtinsk have reduced or suspended operations due to the combined impact of sanctions and Ukrainian attacks. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to visit Ukraine in the coming weeks to discuss the potential deployment of an international peacekeeping force, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 10, citing sources familiar with the matter. This would mark Starmer&#x2019;s first visit to Ukraine since becoming prime minister. The trip comes as European nations ramp up discussions about regional security ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on Jan. 20. Paris and London are reportedly exploring the possibility of deploying French and British troops to monitor a potential ceasefire along the contact line in Ukraine. A senior NATO official told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in December that these discussions are happening bilaterally in national capitals rather than within NATO structures. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly highlighted the potential peacekeeping mission on Jan. 9 following the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. French President Emmanuel Macron initially proposed deploying Western troops in February last year and revisited the idea in May, suggesting that France might consider sending forces if Russian troops broke through Ukraine&#x2019;s defensive lines. Donald Trump has also advocated for Europe to take the lead in monitoring a potential ceasefire. The Wall Street Journal reported on Dec. 12 that Trump emphasized Europe&#x2019;s greater responsibility in addressing Russian aggression. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 9 that Ukraine would only consider foreign peacekeepers if it secures a clear timeline for NATO membership. Ukrainian officials maintain that NATO membership is essential for lasting peace. While full membership is unlikely amid the ongoing war, Kyiv has urged NATO allies to extend an invitation as a signal of support.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukrainian-neptune-missile-hits-russian-drone-warehouse-in-rostov-oblast-sbu-source-claims/	2025-01-10T12:07:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-10-at-14_51_08.png
Ukrainian lawmakers move to dismiss Energy Minister, MP Zhelezniak reports	Members of the Verkhovna Rada Energy Committee led by MP Inna Sovsun, have initiated a resolution to dismiss Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko, Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak announced on Jan. 10. Zhelezniak cited several reasons for the motion, including &quot;systemic corruption in the energy sector,&quot; &quot;failure to protect parts of the energy infrastructure,&quot; and &quot;lies and manipulations.&quot; The MP also criticized Halushchenko&#x2019;s behavior during a parliamentary session earlier that day, calling it &quot;unacceptable.&quot; One of the key controversies involves the public disclosure of information on further completion of the Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant&#x2019;s (NPP) power units. Sovsun highlighted a letter sent to the Energy Committee from representatives of the European Commission and the U.S. Embassy expressing concerns about this issue. During the session, Halushchenko faced backlash for dismissive remarks directed at the EU ambassador. Responding to Sovsun&apos;s concerns, he said: &quot;In fact, this is exactly the case, and if we are talking about the third and fourth [power units], it is in the text of the law that these units will operate on American fuel. As for the position of the middle-level clerks of the European Commission&apos;s representation, Inna, I am very sorry that you are running around embassies and pouring mud on our energy sector and our state.&quot; The Energy Ministry later clarified that Halushchenko&apos;s remarks did not reference the EU ambassador to Ukraine, as suggested during the session. Zhelezniak called on lawmakers to support the resolution for Halushchenko&#x2019;s dismissal, marking a potential shift in Ukraine&#x2019;s energy leadership. Halushchenko has served as Energy Minister since his appointment on Apr. 29, 2021.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-lawmakers-move-to-dismiss-energy-minister-mp-zhelezniak-reported/	2025-01-10T11:24:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/halus-1.jpg

As Russia cuts Transnistria from gas, stranded locals search for someone to blame	VARNI&#x21A;A, Moldova &#x2014; The buzzing sound of chainsaws and generators is now common in Varni&#x21B;a, a village of 5,000 that borders Moldova&apos;s Russian-controlled region of Transnistria. Located next to the Russian-controlled city of Bender (Tighina), the village is subordinated to Chi&#x219;in&#x103;u but depends on the neighbouring breakaway region for its energy infrastructure. Workers from TiraspolTransGaz, the company managing the gas supply in Transnistria, go door-to-door to make sure the gas taps are switched off. Gas storage in Russian-occupied region of Transnistria will last another 24 days after the halt of Russian supplies, local authorities said on Jan. 8. Many of the 360,000 people in Transnistria have already had their gas, electricity, and water cut since the start of the year, following the end of Russian gas shipments through Ukraine and Moscow&apos;s decline to use alternative routes to maintain the region&apos;s energy supply intact. &quot;This is a security rather than an energy crisis,&quot; says Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean, adding that Russia&apos;s aim is to influence the upcoming parliamentary elections set for the upcoming autumn. The self-proclaimed authorities of Russian-controlled Transnistria never paid Gazprom for the gas they used, while Moscow was continuing to bill Moldova for it. Chi&#x219;in&#x103;u declined to pay. Meanwhile, Transnistrian authorities used the gas to produce electricity in the Russian-owned Cuciurgan (Dnestrovsc) power station and sold the surplus to the unoccupied parts of the country cheaply. Following Russia&apos;s decision to cut the supplies, and not use the TurkStream pipeline to ship gas to Moldova bypassing Ukraine, Transnistria has been facing blackouts, while in the rest of the country its energy bills have doubled. Varni&#x21B;a, which is subordinated to the Moldovan capital Chi&#x219;in&#x103;u but is connected to the breakaway region&apos;s energy systems, had its gas switched off since New Year. Following the gas cut, people were forced to switch to electric heaters, while planned blackouts of up to nine hours per day were introduced by Tiraspol authorities. Zarina, at the shop where she works without electricity, in Varni&#x163;a, Moldova on Jan. 8, 2025. (The Kyiv Independent)Vadim Krasnoselsky, the self-proclaimed president of Transnistria, accused Chi&#x219;in&#x103;u of strangling the region. Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, also said Moldova and Ukraine were to blame for the energy crisis in Transnistria. The Moldovan authorities say Russia has created the crisis in the region. According to Moldova&apos;s contract with Gazprom, which expires in 2026, Russia is responsible for securing the transit. The main option would be the use of the TurkStream and Trans-Balkan pipelines, connecting Russia with Moldova via Turkey, Bulgaria, and Romania. Moldovan authorities say they also offered TiraspolTransGaz help to buy gas on the international market, just like the rest of Moldova has been doing since 2021 when Russia reduced its gas supply to the country. The offer, however, was rejected by Tiraspol. In a press conference following a visit to Varni&#x21B;a on Jan. 9, Moldovan President Maia Sandu said the government will equip public institutions in the villages of Varni&#x21B;a and Copanca, as well the rest of the area &#xA0;under Chi&#x219;in&#x103;u control that may be affected by the energy crisis, with biomass power plants, wood and pellets. Sandu also mentioned her Jan. 8 phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which the two discussed Ukraine potentially selling coal to Transnistria to power the Cuciurgan plant. &quot;When we had a biomass heating system installed as part of a (European) project in our high school ten years ago, I thought it was a whim,&quot; Varni&#x21B;a Mayor Alexandr Nichitenco said. &quot;Now I can see it&apos;s useful; the children can go study unbothered,&quot; he said, adding that he has asked the government for more such projects. In the long run, Varni&#x21B;a will be able to connect to the Chi&#x219;in&#x103;u gas and electric systems, but according to the mayor, the switch may take around nine months. &quot;It will be a different winter,&quot; he said. &quot;Everyone is guilty except for the people,&quot; says 32-year-old Zarina, a shop assistant who lives in breakaway Bender (Tighina) but commutes to neighboring government-controlled Varni&#x21B;a for work. The light is off in the cornershop she works in but clients come in unfazed to buy cakes and candies for the holiday season, ongoing until the old-style New Year or St Basil&apos;s Day celebrated on Jan. 14. &quot;For now, everything is ok,&quot; says Zarina, born during the 1992 war between Russia and Moldova, known as the Transnistria War. Her flat in Bender (Tighina) is still connected to gas, electricity, and water. &quot;But if worse comes to worst, we have grandparents living in the countryside with wood-burning stoves,&quot; she says. &quot;I have been through this before. I was there when the electricity was frequently cut in villages in the 1990s,&quot; she adds.

(The Kyiv Independent)A few streets away from the shop, retiree Ion B&#x103;ie&#x219;u puts wood in a bucket to take it to the stove he has built himself to heat up two of three rooms in his house. Normally, he and his wife Ecaterina used to rely on gas to warm up, since it was so cheap. But since the cut, they have switched to making a fire twice a day. &quot;(Russians) have kept us hostages for 30 years,&quot; says B&#x103;ie&#x219;u, who fought as a volunteer in the Russo-Moldovan war of 1992. &quot;When you ask people&apos; why do you vote for pro-Russian parties?&apos; they respond &#x2014; &apos;because of gas,&apos;&quot; says the 75-year-old. &quot;Don&apos;t you realize you&apos;re going to pay dearly for this at some point?&quot; he goes on. A few houses down the street, 49-year-old Oleg gathers his old wood fence panels in piles in the garden to have them ready to be used to warm up his home. He says he has enough wood for the next four months. Working in a chicken factory, he worries about the potential rise of gas prices, blaming President Sandu&apos;s pro-European stance for the ongoing Russian-coined energy crisis and the soaring bills. &quot;Russians want to give us gas, but Ukrainians don&apos;t want to transmit it,&quot; he says. Oleg, with a pile of wood, in Varni&#x163;a, Moldova on Jan. 8, 2025. (The Kyiv Independent)Beyond wood-burning stoves, people have also bought air-conditioning and generators. Tamara Cara, who together with her family runs a textile factory in Varni&#x21B;a, producing medical suits for export to Germany, has just bought generators &#x2014; two for the factory and one for her house. The 69-year-old employs 150 people, who mostly commute from Bender (Tighina). She says she hasn&apos;t been able to enjoy the festive season and instead &quot;was all nerves&quot; because of the blackouts caused by the gas cut. She blames the Russians for it but has no hope that the situation would get sorted any time soon. &quot;At least we don&apos;t have war,&quot; Cara says, remembering how she hid in the basement in 1992 when her husband was fighting on the front line. Tamara Cara at her house in Varni&#x163;a, Moldova on Jan. 8, 2025. (The Kyiv Independent)Prime Minister Recean has reiterated that the 2,000 illegally stationed Russian troops need to withdraw from Transnistria in order to let Chisinau manage its internationally recognized territory and solve the ongoing energy crisis caused by the occupying forces. Nicolae, a cultural worker from Russian-occupied Grigoriopol who preferred to have his name changed to avoid persecution, says people&apos;s views depend on what media they consume. &quot;Some blame Chi&#x219;in&#x103;u, others blame Zelensky. There are others still who put the blame on Moscow,&quot; Nicolae says. While he has satellite TV and follows the Moldovan public broadcaster and pro-European independent media, the majority have cable television, which runs three local Tiraspol-controlled channels, as well as Russian television, banned in the rest of Moldova since 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/as-russia-cuts-transnistria-from-gas-stranded-locals-look-who-to-blame/	2025-01-10T10:11:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Moldova_Varnita_0J6A0136.jpg
Breakthrough' — Poland, Ukraine reach agreement on Volyn tragedy exhumations, PM Tusk says	A decision has been made to exhume the first victims of the Volyn tragedy, a contentious chapter in Polish-Ukrainian relations, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced on Jan. 10. &quot;Finally, a breakthrough. A decision has been made on the first exhumations of Polish victims of the UPA. I would like to thank the ministers of culture of Poland and Ukraine for their good cooperation. We are waiting for further decisions,&quot; Tusk wrote in a post on X. The Volyn massacre, which took place during World War II, involved widespread violence that claimed tens of thousands of Polish and Ukrainian lives. Poland characterizes the events as genocide perpetrated by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), while Ukraine has called for shared acknowledgment of responsibility for the atrocities. The decision followed a Jan. 9 meeting in Poland between Ukrainian National Unity Minister Oleksii Chernyshov and Polish Culture Minister Anna Wroblewska. The discussions emphasized the role of culture in preserving national identity and fostering socio-economic development, the Polish Culture Ministry noted. President Volodymyr Zelensky and Prime Minister Tusk previously met in Lviv on Dec. 17 to address historical reconciliation, including the legacy of the Volyn massacre. Tusk emphasized the importance of unity despite historical challenges. &quot;History certainly cannot divide us,&quot; he said on Dec. 17. The exhumations represent a significant step forward in resolving longstanding historical tensions and strengthening Polish-Ukrainian relations amid challenges posed by Russia&apos;s aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/breakthrough-poland-ukraine-reach-agreement-on-volyn-tragedy-exhumations-pm-tusk-says/	2025-01-10T09:57:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2167276071.jpg
Ukraine conducts 'precision strike' on Russian army command post in Donetsk Oblast, General Staff claims	Ukrainian forces struck a Russian army command post in Svitlodarsk in Russian-occupied Donetsk Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 10. In a post on Facebook, the military said the &quot;successful hit&quot; targeted Russia&apos;s 3rd Army Corps. Svitlodarsk is located around 30 kilometers southeast of Bakhmut, and was occupied by Russian forces in May 2022. The General Staff did not specify what weapon was used in the attack or the extent of the damage inflicted, but said &quot;all necessary measures were taken to limit the risk to civilians.&quot; Ukraine fields homemade missiles and long-range drones as well as Western-supplied arms like HIMARS, ATACMS, or Storm Shadow missiles. &quot;This week in the Donetsk region the Armed Forces of Ukraine has conducted a series of strikes on facilities seized by Russian invaders,&quot; the General Staff added. This is the second such reported strike this week &#x2014; on Jan. 8 the General Staff said Ukrainian forces carried out a precision strike against a command post of Russia&apos;s 8th Combined Arms Army in Russian-occupied Khartsyzk in Donetsk Oblast. Similar attacks were also reported in recent days, including a precision strike against a Russian command post in Kursk Oblast on Jan. 7 and another one in the same region on Jan. 2.Earlier on Jan. 8, the Ukrainian military announced a successful long-range attack against a Russian oil depot in Saratov Oblast that provided fuel to the nearby Engels-2 airbase.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-conducts-precision-strike-on-russian-army-command-post-in-donetsk-oblast-general-staff-claims/	2025-01-10T08:58:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2030058326.jpg
US, UK impose sweeping sanctions on Russia’s oil sector, target shadow fleet	The U.S. and the U.K. have enacted their most extensive sanctions against Russia&apos;s oil industry, targeting nearly 200 vessels of the so-called &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; major oil companies, and associated entities, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced on Jan. 10. &quot;The United States is taking sweeping action against Russia&apos;s key source of revenue for funding its brutal and illegal war against Ukraine,&quot; Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. The sanctions include more than 180 oil-carrying vessels of Russia&apos;s so-called shadow fleet, a group of tankers routinely used for sanction evasion. Several of these vessels are also reportedly involved in transporting sanctioned Iranian oil. The measures also target two of Russia&apos;s major oil producers, Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegaz, along with dozens of their subsidiaries. Combined, these companies reportedly produce over 1 million barrels of oil daily, generating an estimated $23 billion of revenue annually, according to the U.S. Treasury. The sanctions also extend to dozens of Russian energy officials and corporate executives, further tightening restrictions on Moscow&apos;s oil industry. In addition to sanctions, Ukraine has disrupted Russia&apos;s oil production with targeted drone strikes on infrastructure. Refineries in Tuapse, Ilyich, and Novoshakhtinsk have reduced or suspended operations due to the combined impact of sanctions and Ukrainian attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-imposes-sweeping-sanctions-on-russias-oil-sector-targets-shadow-fleet/	2025-01-10T08:41:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
Inside one of Russia's most horrific torture chambers in Ukraine	During the occupation of Kharkiv Oblast in 2022, Russian forces established nearly 30 torture chambers in various parts of the region.

Incoming Trump peace envoy postponed Ukraine visit over legal reasons, Kyiv confirms	The Trump administration&apos;s Ukraine peace envoy Keith Kellogg postponed his planned visit to Ukraine for legal reasons, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said on Jan. 10, in comments reported by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Tykhyi cited the U.S. Logan Act, which restricts unauthorized negotiations by private citizens with foreign governments, as the reason for the delay. Last month, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kellogg was expected to visit Ukraine before the inauguration. Reuters then reported on Jan. 6 that the trip had been postponed but did not cite the reason behind the decision. &quot;I would prefer that General Kellogg&apos;s team comment on the timing of the visit. I can say that the visit is still being prepared; it will take place,&quot; Tykhyi said, emphasizing that the delay is not politically motivated. &quot;All contacts should take place after the president takes office. According to our information, this is the only reason,&quot; he said. The visit is now expected to occur after President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20. Kellogg, a former national security advisor to Vice President Mike Pence, is a known figure in Kyiv and &quot;has maintained close ties... in recent years,&quot; Tykhyi said on Nov. 28. The envoy is also scheduled to visit other European capitals, including Rome and Paris, as part of the Trump administration&apos;s efforts to address Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Trump has pledged to end the war quickly but has yet to provide specific details on his peace plan. Zelensky reiterated Ukraine&apos;s commitment to achieving a diplomatic resolution by 2025, expressing cautious optimism about working with the incoming U.S. administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/incoming-trump-peace-envoy-postpones-ukraine-visit-over-legal-reasons-kyiv-confirms/	2025-01-10T07:35:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1247741520.jpg
Japan's new sanctions are 'significant blow to Russia’s military-industrial complex,' Zelensky says	The Japanese government has broadened its sanctions list in response to Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, the country&apos;s Foreign Ministry announced on Jan. 10. The new measures targeted individuals and entities from Russia, China, the United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Thailand, Turkey, and North Korea. Twenty-nine Russian entities, including the Machine-Building Scientific and Production Union and Aleksinsky Chemical Plant, three banks, and 11 individuals, are among those affected. Export restrictions were imposed on 22 additional Russian companies and 335 commodity names. &quot;It is a significant blow to Russia&#x2019;s military-industrial complex, limiting access to critical microelectronics and creating additional obstacles for the production of missiles and drones,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said in response to the move. Additionally, sanctions have been imposed on 31 foreign companies from China, the UAE, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Thailand, Turkey, and Georgia, as well as Georgian MRB Bank, and one North Korean citizen. Japan lifted sanctions against eight individuals, including Violetta Prigozhina, the mother of Wagner Group then-leader leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, who died in a plane crash on Aug. 23. While refraining from providing lethal military aid, Japan has consistently supported Ukraine in its struggle against Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. On Jun. 21, Tokyo, for the first time, announced sanctions against China-based companies over their support for Russian aggression. Japan has also previously joined the international sanctions regime against Russia and other steps taken against Moscow within the Group of Seven (G7).	https://kyivindependent.com/japan-sanctions-russias-defense-firms-entities-foreign-ministry-reported/	2025-01-10T07:13:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2076165812.jpg
Ukrainian forces defending Kurakhove thermal power plant amid intense fighting in Donetsk Oblast, military says	Ukrainian troops are holding defensive lines at the Kurakhove thermal power plant despite fierce fighting in the sector, Khortytsia group of forces spokesperson Viktor Trehubov said on national television on Jan. 10. &quot;Now the Russians are trying to attack in the area of Dachne, and drive Ukrainian forces out of Kurakhove. Ukrainian forces are holding the thermal power plant and inflicting all the damage they can on the enemy,&quot; Trehubov said. Kurakhove has become one of the focal points of the Russian offensive in Donetsk Oblast over the past few months, turning the town into one of the hottest sectors of the front. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 6 that its forces had fully captured Kurakhove in, a statement not confirmed at the time by Ukraine. On Jan. 7, a military spokesperson said Ukrainian forces continue to hold positions in the western outskirts of Kurakhove and the power plant, but the situation in the town is &quot;difficult.&quot; The town lies over 20 kilometers (over 10 miles) north of Russian-occupied Vuhledar and over 30 kilometers (almost 20 miles) south of the key front-line town of Pokrovsk. The estimated Russian advance in the Kurakhove sector of Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 10, 2025, according to the DeepState monitoring group. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Ukrainian troops are destroying large amounts of Russian military equipment in the Kurakhove sector, Trehubov added. Ukrainian Armed Forces repelled 29 Russian attacks in the Kurakhove sector near Sribne, Andriivka, Petropavlivka, Kurakhove, and Dachne over the past day, the General Staff reported earlier in the day. Following the capture of Mariinka in early 2024, the Russian army intensified its advance toward Kurakhove. Street fighting is currently taking place in the town. Russian forces had earlier blown up the dam of the Kurakhove Reservoir, a hydraulic structure near the village of Stari Terny in the Kurakhove community. The thermal power plant in Kurakhove, for which the damaged reservoir was created, is not operating. The industrial facility has now become a fortification, and the scene of intense urban fighting in Kurakhove. If taken, Kurakhove would be the first significant town to fall into Russian hands in 2025 after Russia took Avdiivka and Vuhledar last year. Moscow&apos;s troops are also focusing their efforts on Pokrovsk, an important logistics hub, as part of their overall goal to capture the entire Donetsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-forces-defend-kurakhove-thermal-power-plant-amid-intense-fighting-military-says/	2025-01-10T06:42:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192142645.jpg
Scholz blocks proposal for $3 billion arms package for Ukraine, Spiegel reports	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has blocked a proposal for an additional military aid package for Ukraine worth 3 billion euros ($3.09 billion), Spiegel reported on Jan. 9, citing its undisclosed sources. Under Scholz&apos;s leadership, Germany has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. The chancellor has nevertheless often been criticized for his cautious approach on some key issues, such as his refusal to provide Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine. The new assistance plan, proposed by German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, was for additional weapons including three additional Iris-T air defense batteries, 10 howitzers, and more artillery ammunition, acording to Spiegel. But Scholz claimed the existing allocation of 4 billion euros ($4.1 billion) for 2025, as well as funds from the $50 billion G7 loan financed by frozen Russian assets, should be sufficient, Spiegel reported. Scholz also expressed concern that the new government could take on significant financial obligations after early federal elections in February if the package was allowed to go ahead. Baerbock and Pistorius justified the need for the package by arguing that the combat situation in Ukraine was worsening, and that there was uncertainty about further U.S. support under Donald Trump&apos;s leadership. Pistorius and Baerbock hoped to gain parliamentary support for their proposal before the federal elections, and presented their proposal as &quot;a vital signal of Germany&apos;s unwavering support.&quot; Despite Scholz&apos;s lack of support, Pistorius reiterated Germany&apos;s support during a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, also known as Ramstein, on Jan. 9, according to Spiegel. Pistorius announced the provision of nearly 50 guided missiles for the Iris-T air defense system. The missiles, originally designed for the Bundeswehr, were redirected directly from production to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/scholz-blocks-proposal-for-additional-3-billion-worth-arms-package-for-ukraine-spiegel-reports/	2025-01-10T05:50:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175014888.jpg
Ukrainian Neptune missile hits Russian drone warehouse in Rostov Oblast, SBU source claims	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. Ukraine struck a Russian warehouse storing ammunition and reconnaissance drones using a domestically-made Neptune missile overnight on Jan. 10, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told The Kyiv Independent. According to the source, the attack near the village of Chaltyr in Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast was carried out by the SBU and Ukraine&apos;s Navy. &#xA0; At first, Ukrainian drones reportedly &quot;overloaded&quot; Russian air defenses, with a Neptune missile hitting the site shortly after, the source said. The extent of the damage was not disclosed. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-neptune-missile-hits-russian-drone-warehouse-in-rostov-oblast-sbu-source-claims/	2025-01-10T04:32:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/--------------2025-01-10-142355.png
EU provides Ukraine with $3 billion, first tranche of loans from bloc backed by Russian frozen assets	Ukraine has received 3 billion euros ($3 .09 billion) from the EU, the first tranche of loans from the bloc funded by proceeds of frozen Russian assets, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Jan. 10. The money has been provided through the Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) initiative, in which G7 countries pledged to provide Ukraine with a $50 billion loan, with the EU contributing about $20 billion. &quot;This is the first tranche of funds from the European Union, secured through income from frozen Russian assets,&quot; Shmyhal said in a post on Telegram. &quot;In this way, we are implementing the principle of &apos;Russia will pay&apos; and strengthening Ukraine&apos;s financial stability in 2025,&quot; he added. The U.S. Treasury Department announced in December that it will provide $20 billion in loan assistance to Ukraine, marking its contribution to the initiative. While Western countries have frozen $300 billion in Russian assets, they can only access the annual income generated by these funds, approximately $3.2 billion. These profits will back the $50-billion loan to Kyiv, while the vast majority of the assets are frozen in European countries. Speaking at the G7 summit in June, President Volodymyr Zelensky called for a mechanism to fully confiscate the frozen Russian funds, highlighting their potential to bolster Ukraine&apos;s long-term recovery. According to October reports, the G7 plans to keep these Russian assets immobilized even after the war ends.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-provides-ukraine-with-nearly-3-billion-in-loans-backed-by-russian-frozen-assets/	2025-01-10T03:59:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-497631536.jpg
Russian elite 'disappointed' about Putin's handling of war in Ukraine, Meduza reports	Members of Russia&apos;s political elite are &quot;disappointed&quot; with Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s handling of the war in Ukraine, and had hoped it would end in 2024, Meduza reported on Jan. 9. Citing ten officials including two sources close to Putin&#x2019;s administration, and one senator, the independent Russian media outlet said the state of the country&apos;s economy was a particular &quot;point of tension.&quot; &quot;The main emotion is disappointment,&quot; a source in the Russian government told Meduza, adding: &#xA0;&quot;We expected the war to end, for the fighting to end. Fatigue has been the main feeling for a long time.&quot; &quot;We&#x2019;re already tired of waiting, even. It feels like you&#x2019;re going deeper and deeper every day. We also expected some kind of lifting of sanctions in exchange for peace. Now, they&#x2019;re inflicting more and more pain,&quot; the source added. Russia recently suffered one of its &quot;most costly defeats,&quot; U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Jan 8, in reference to the shutdown of Russia&apos;s gas transit through Ukrainian territory. Ukraine terminated Russian natural gas transit through its territory on Jan. 1. Kyiv had repeatedly warned that it would not extend the agreement when it expires at the end of 2024 because it did not want to finance Russia&apos;s war. Sources cited by Meduza also said the prospects for peace had diminished after Ukraine launched its Kursk incursion in August 2024, though they added the war may have dragged on into 2025 regardless. &quot;The president likes to fight, it&#x2019;s exciting for him. Why stop halfway if you can put the final squeeze on them?&quot; one said. But the source added that there was also frustration among high-ranking security officials that Putin had not taken steps to put Russia on a full war footing, such as launching another round of mobilization. As Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine approaches its third anniversary, both sides face increasing economic and demographic pressures caused by the war. Russian losses in Ukraine are helping fuel a demographic timebomb that could see the country&#x2019;s population reduced by half by the end of the century, experts told the Kyiv Independent earlier this week. &quot;The impact on Russian society is devastating,&quot; said Harley Balzer, emeritus professor of government and international affairs at Georgetown University. &quot;From Russia&apos;s perspective, (winning the war in Ukraine) is the smaller problem. The bigger issue is, is it going to be a viable country afterward regardless?&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-elite-disappointed-about-putins-handling-of-war-in-ukraine-meduza-reports/	2025-01-10T03:33:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192275787.jpg
Kremlin 'welcomes' Trump's 'readiness' for talks on Russia's war in Ukraine	The Kremlin on Jan. 10 said it &quot;welcomed&quot; President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s &quot;readiness&quot; for talks, but added plans for any face-to-face meeting would not be drawn up until after his inauguration later this month. Trump said on Jan. 9 that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to meet with him, and that preparations for a meeting are underway. &quot;He wants to meet, and we are setting it up,&quot; Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, adding: &quot;President Putin wants to meet. He has said that even publicly and we have to get that war over with. That&apos;s a bloody mess.&quot; Speaking to Russian media on Jan. 10, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said &quot;no conditions are required&quot; for such a meeting. &quot;(Only) a mutual desire and political will to conduct a dialogue and resolve existing problems through dialogue is required,&quot; he said. &quot;We see that Mr. Trump also declares his readiness to resolve problems through dialogue, we welcome this,&quot; he added. But Peskov added there were not currently any concrete plans for a meeting. Trump is to take office on Jan. 20. During his presidential campaign, Trump claimed that he would be able to end the war in Ukraine quickly, in part because of his allegedly good relationship with Putin. Putin, on Dec. 19, said that he was prepared to meet with Trump at &quot;any time&quot; to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. Since then, Russian officials have dismissed reported peace deals from Trump&apos;s team, saying they do not meet Putin&apos;s terms. Trump&apos;s push for a quick end to the war has led to fears that Kyiv will be pressured into unfavorable concessions, including loss of land. About 20% of Ukrainian territory is currently under occupation by Russian forces. Trump&apos;s nominee for special Ukraine peace envoy, retired general Keith Kellogg, has praised Trump&apos;s willingness to engage in dialogue with the Russian president, and criticized U.S. President Joe Biden for refusing to do so. Kellogg said on Jan. 8 that the administration aims to end the war in 100 days.	https://kyivindependent.com/preparations-for-trump-putin-meeting-wont-begin-until-presidents-inauguration-in-us-kremlin-says/	2025-01-10T02:52:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1244638462.jpg
Citing Russia's war in Ukraine, Norway plans to resume construction of civilian bomb shelters	The Norwegian government plans to resume construction of bomb shelters, citing Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine as evidence they are needed in case of a &quot;worst-case scenario,&quot; NRK reported on Jan. 10. &quot;There is more uncertainty around us,&quot; Norwegian Justice and Public Security Minister Emilie Mehl told the outlet, adding: &quot;We must take care of the civilian population in the event of a &apos;worst-case scenario&apos; of war or armed attack. Shelters are one of the protective measures we need.&quot; Up until 1998, any new large apartment buildings constructed in Norway were required to incorporate a bomb shelter into their design. No new shelters have been built since, NRK reports. &quot;We are now actually setting a requirement that buildings over 1,000 square meters must have shelters,&quot; Mehl said. The Norwegian government is proposing two types of shelters &#x2014; new shelters will meet the requirements of modern designs which protect against chemical, radioactive, as well as high explosives. The second type of shelter will be adapted from existing structures to protect against conventional weapons. &quot;These can be garages, subway tunnels, or other underground structures that also have an important and distinctive function in our daily lives,&quot; Mehl said. Bomb shelters have become part of the daily routine for most Ukrainiains, who seek refuge in basements, metro stations, and other structures like underground car parks during Russian bombardments. &quot;We have learned a lot about modern warfare, and we also see that shelters and refuges are essential to protecting civilians. We also must have this in Norway, and it has to be part of the country&apos;s preparedness for the future,&quot; Mehl said. Norway is ranked 12th in the world regarding the amount of aid provided to Ukraine, having so far provided $2.8 billion in humanitarian, financial, and military support, according to the Kiel Institute&apos;s Ukraine Support Tracker. Oslo may increase its support for Ukraine to 30 billion kroner ($2.7 billion) in 2025, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store announced on Nov. 26.	https://kyivindependent.com/war-in-ukraine-prompts-norway-to-build-new-bomb-shelters/	2025-01-10T02:24:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1937598237-1.jpg

Ukrainian drones reportedly attack Russia's Leningrad, Rostov oblasts, causing severe fires	Ukrainian drones attacked several Russian oblasts overnight on Jan. 10, causing severe fires in Leningrad and Rostov oblasts, local authorities and Russian independent media reported. Russian air defense forces reportedly intercepted 40 Ukrainian drones throughout the night, Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed. According to the ministry, Russian forces destroyed 16 drones over Rostov Oblast, four over Kursk and Voronezh oblasts, three over Bryansk Oblast, two over the Kuban region, one over Belgorod Oblast, and 10 over the Azov Sea. The drone attack reportedly caused a large-scale fire in the town of Gatchina in Leningrad Oblast. The fire started in an industrial zone, the independent news channel Astra reported, citing locals. Ingria Tech, a company that sells panel coatings and paints, is located near the fire site, as well as a food processing facility, and a building materials plant, according to Astra. The Russian state news agency TASS also claimed an acetone plant was on fire. The fire covered an area of 1,900 square meters, Russia&apos;s Emergency Situations Ministry said. No one was injured, the ministry added. Another fire caused by a drone attack occurred in Rostov Oblast. Near the city of Rostov, a fire broke out in an industrial production facility covering 2,000 square meters, the Russian state-controlled news agency RIA Novosti reported.

EU issues new alert for planes flying in Russian airspace	The EU&apos;s aviation safety watchdog on Jan. 9 issued a new alert advising non-European airlines to avoid flying over western Russia following the downing of an Azerbaijan Airlines plane last month. The crash, which killed 38 people, is believed to have been caused by Russian air defenses firing at Ukrainian drones. &quot;The ongoing conflict following the Russian invasion of Ukraine poses the risk of civil aircraft being unintentionally targeted in the airspace of the Russian Federation due to possible civil-military coordination deficiencies, and the potential for misidentification,&quot; the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said. &quot;EASA recommends not to operate within the affected airspace of the Russian Federation located west of longitude 60&#xB0; East at all altitudes and flight levels.&quot; Russian airspace is already closed to EU airlines. The alert applies to third-country operators authorised by EASA. The Azerbaijan Airlines plane, en route from Baku to Grozny, Chechnya, changed course and crashed in Kazakhstan on Dec. 25. Multiple reports and official Azerbaijani statements attributed the disaster to a missile launched by a Russian Pantsir-S air defense system. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has maintained close ties with Azerbaijan, offered condolences during a Dec. 28 phone call but stopped short of admitting Russian responsibility. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev criticized Russia&#x2019;s handling of the incident, accusing its agencies of suppressing evidence and promoting &quot;absurd versions&quot; of events. Aliyev also blamed Russia for failing to close its airspace near Grozny and highlighted poor coordination between its military and civil aviation services as factors contributing to the tragedy.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-issues-new-alert-for-planes-flying-in-russian-airspace/	2025-01-09T22:51:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190903922-1.jpg

Lukashenko refuses to invite OSCE observers to upcoming election	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has refused to invite a mission from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to observe the country&apos;s upcoming presidential election, the OSCE said in a statement issued Jan. 9. Lukashenko has been in power for 30 years and is seeking a seventh term on Jan. 26. The regime&apos;s election rigging in 2020 &#x2014;&#xA0;the last time Belarus held a presidential vote &#x2014; sparked mass protests and a subsequent violent crackdown. The OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) said Minsk&apos;s decision not to invite observers was &quot;deeply regrettable&quot; and a violation of the country&apos;s international obligations. &quot;I deeply regret the decision of the Belarusian authorities not to invite OSCE states through ODIHR to observe the forthcoming presidential election, depriving the country&apos;s citizens of a transparent and full assessment of the entire process,&quot; ODIHR Director Maria Telalian said. &quot;This decision underscores the continued lack of commitment by the Belarusian authorities to invite other OSCE states to observe and provide an independent view on whether the elections are held in line with OSCE commitments and international democratic standards.&quot; ODIHR said it had reached out to Belarusian officials over the past few months in efforts to secure an invitation to observe the elections, but received no offer. OSCE monitors were also unable to observe the August 2020 election due to lack of a timely invitation, the organization said. According to OSCE, the office is still monitoring events in Belarus, despite its inability to observe the Jan. 26 vote.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-refuses-to-invite-osce-observers-to-upcoming-election/	2025-01-09T21:53:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2147741177.jpg
Kyiv calls Polish presidential candidate 'manipulative' for comments on Ukraine's EU, NATO accession	Polish presidential candidate Karol Nawrocki&apos;s recent comments on Ukraine were &quot;manipulative,&quot; the Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued Jan. 9. The statement comes after Nawrocki said in a television interview on Jan. 8 that he does not currently see Ukraine becoming a member of the European Union or NATO. &quot;Today, I do not see Ukraine in any structure &#x2014; neither in the European Union nor in NATO &#x2014; until important... issues for Poles are resolved,&quot; Nawrocki said in an interview with Polsat News. &quot;A country that cannot answer for a very brutal crime against 120,000 of its neighbors cannot be part of international alliances.&quot; Nawrocki&apos;s remarks refer to the 1943 Volyn massacre, during which tens of thousands of Poles were killed by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) in Nazi-occupied Ukraine and thousands of Ukrainians were killed in retaliation. The legacy of the massacre remains an ongoing source of modern-day tensions between Poland and Ukraine. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry denounced Nawrocki&apos;s comments as &quot;biased and manipulative.&quot; &quot;Such statements indicate that the Polish politician prioritizes short-term political considerations over the strategic security interests of his own country, the good-neighbourly relations between Ukraine and Poland, and the shared values of freedom, democracy, and justice.&quot; Poland will hold presidential elections on May 18. Nawrocki is campaigning with the opposition Law and Justice Party (PiS), a right-wing political faction. Nawrocki, currently the head of the Polish National Remembrance Institute, criticized a joint statement on the exhumation of Volyn massacre victims in Ukraine between Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha and his Polish counterpart Radoslaw Sikorski. &#xA0; The agreement was an &quot;unnecessary outburst by the head of Polish diplomacy,&quot; Nawrocki said, accusing the Sikorski of leveraging the agreement to launch his own presidential campaign. &#xA0; In its response, Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry emphasized the ongoing &quot;constructive dialogue&quot; between Kyiv and Warsaw. &#xA0; t	https://kyivindependent.com/today-i-dont-see-ukraine-in-the-eu-or-nato-polish-presidential-candidate-says/	2025-01-09T21:37:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161798255.jpg
Norway allocates over $2 billion in military aid for Ukraine in 2025, Umerov says	Norway has allocated 2 billion euros &#xA0;($2.1 billion) for military aid to Ukraine in 2025, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said following a meeting with his Norwegian counterpart on Jan. 9. Norway has been one of Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters in Europe. Previously, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere on Dec. 16 announced 2.7 billion Norwegian kroner ($242 million) to bolster Ukraine&apos;s navy and help it deter Russian threats in the Black Sea. Umerov met with Norwegian Defense Minister Bjorn Arild Gram on the sidelines of the Ramstein summit in Germany on Jan. 9. According to Umerov, the 2025 assistance to Ukraine will mark the largest military aid package in Norway&apos;s history. The two ministers discussed how to prioritize Norway&apos;s assistance. &quot;Special attention was given to the strengthening of air defense &#x2014; a critical area where we count on Norway&apos;s support,&quot; Umerov said in a social media post following the summit. Norway will continue investing in Ukraine&apos;s domestic military production and joint projects, particularly ammunition production, he added. Norway has pledged a new funding mechanism for Ukraine, the &quot;Norwegian model,&quot; meant to complement an existing &quot;Danish model&quot; of defense spending. The Danish model aims to purchase arms from Ukrainian manufacturers rather than providing materiel shipments. Denmark became the first country to offer to donate arms to Ukraine via direct purchases from the Ukrainian defense industry, as Kyiv&apos;s defense budget does not match the capacities of domestic weapons production. Ukraine&apos;s other allies also reaffirmed their support at the Ramstein summit, the last such meeting under U.S. President Joe Biden.	https://kyivindependent.com/norway-allocates-over-2-billion-in-military-aid-for-ukraine-in-2025-umerov-says/	2025-01-09T19:38:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/umerov.jpeg
Trump says Putin wants to meet, arrangements already underway	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Jan. 9 that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to meet with him, and that preparations for the meeting are underway. &quot;He wants to meet, and we are setting it up,&quot; Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. &quot;President Putin wants to meet. He has said that even publicly and we have to get that war over with. That&apos;s a bloody mess.&quot; Trump did not provide any further details on the upcoming meeting. The claim comes days before Trump is set to take office on Jan. 20. Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump promised to negotiate a swift end to the war in Ukraine, often referring to his good relationship with Putin.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-says-putin-wants-to-meet-arrangements-already-underway/	2025-01-09T18:57:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-872780694.jpg
Moscow closely monitoring Trump's Greenland ambitions, Kremlin claims	Russia is closely watching U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s statements about a possible military takeover of Greenland, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claimed on Jan. 9. Peskov&apos;s comments come after Trump on Jan. 7 refused to rule out the possibility of using military force to seize control of Greenland, which he said the U.S. needs for &quot;economic security.&quot; Russia is monitoring the situation due to its &quot;strategic interests&quot; in the Arctic region, Peskov said. &quot;The Arctic is a zone of our national interests, our strategic interests,&quot; Peskov said. &quot;We are interested in preserving the atmosphere of peace and stability in the Arctic zone. We are watching the rather dramatic development of the situation very closely, but so far, thank God, at the level of statements.&quot; Greenland is an autonomous territory of Denmark. It houses both Danish and U.S. military bases and has vast reserves of mineral wealth. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen responded to Trump&apos;s comments by saying Greenland is &quot;not for sale&quot; and that its future belongs to the people of Greenland. Other European officials, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and E.U. chief diplomat Kaja Kallas, also made statements defending the territorial integrity of Greenland. Peskov criticized the response of E.U. leaders as overly timid. &quot;Europe reacts very timidly and it is of course scary to react to Trump&apos;s words, therefore Europe reacts very cautiously, modestly, quietly, almost in a whisper,&quot; Peskov said. Russia&apos;s growing ambitions and military presence in the Arctic have prompted other nations, notably Canada and the U.S., to revise their security strategies in the region. Trump, who returns to the White House on Jan. 20, has touted an expansionist agenda that includes taking over Greenland, seizing the Panama Canal, and annexing Canada. In the same Jan. 7 press conference, he blamed U.S. President Joe Biden and Kyiv&apos;s NATO aspirations for Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/moscow-closely-monitoring-trumps-greenland-ambitions-kremlin-claims/	2025-01-09T18:31:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192273983.jpg
Russia's deployment of North Korean troops in Ukraine signals Putin's desperation, Austin says	Russia has endured over 700,000 casualties since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022&#x2014;more than in all of Moscow&#x2019;s conflicts since World War II combined, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Jan. 9. The toll, which surpasses two-thirds of the Russian military&apos;s pre-war strength, reflects the severe cost of what Vladimir Putin calls &quot;special military operation,&quot; Austin said at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. In November 2024 alone, Russia lost nearly 1,500 troops daily, a pace that has stretched its military resources to the breaking point. &quot;Volunteers cannot make up for these stunning losses,&quot; Austin added. &quot;The Kremlin has been reduced to scouring Russia&#x2019;s jails and coercing contract soldiers.&quot; In a desperate bid to sustain its offensive, &quot;Moscow has even rushed troops from North Korea into a war that they don&#x2019;t belong in,&quot; Austin noted, calling it a clear sign of Putin&#x2019;s growing desperation. Since joining the war in December, over 1,000 North Korean soldiers have reportedly died, according to Austin. President Volodymyr Zelensky placed the figure at 4,000 North Korean troops which included both wounded and killed. U.S. defense secretary also highlighted the economic impact of the war which has been equally devastating for ordinary Russians. With the Kremlin allocating 40 percent of its 2025 budget to sustain the war effort&#x2014;a 25 percent increase from the previous year&#x2014;the ruble has continued its downward spiral, according to Austin. The Kremlin&#x2019;s increasing reliance on authoritarian allies like North Korea has further isolated Moscow on the world stage. &quot;Russia&#x2019;s global stature and strategic position have continued to decay.&quot; Despite the heavy cost, Putin has little to show for his efforts. &quot;Russia has paid an appalling price for this indefensible war,&quot; Austin concluded. &quot;Yet Putin has not achieved a single one of his strategic objectives. Not one.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-deployment-of-north-korean-troops-in-ukraine-signals-putins-desperation-austin-says/	2025-01-09T16:39:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-2096837949.jpg
Canada to allocate $305 million in military assistance to Ukraine	Canada has pledged $305 million (CAD $440 million) in additional military assistance to Ukraine, Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair announced at Ramstein Air Base in Germany on Jan. 9. The announcement includes $138 million (CAD $200 million) allocated to Czechia&#x2019;s initiative for procuring and delivering large-calibre ammunition to Ukraine, adding to over $36 million (CAD $53 million) pledged last year. This funding has already resulted in the delivery of approximately 11,500 rounds of large-calibre ammunition. Another $35 million (CAD $50 million) will be dedicated to procuring various calibres of ammunition from Canadian manufacturers. &quot;The military assistance announced today provides Ukrainians with resources needed to resist Russian aggression,&quot; Blair said. &quot;The (contact group), through the leadership of Secretary Austin, has been vital in ensuring that the military aid we&#x2019;re collectively providing Ukraine is comprehensive, well-coordinated, and meets the country&#x2019;s most pressing needs. Canada remains strongly committed to working with our Allies and partners to support Ukraine until victory.&quot; Blair also committed $70 million (CAD $100 million) to the Danish Model, which supports Ukraine&#x2019;s domestic production of military drones. Drones have played a crucial role in the war, with Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industry advancing rapidly in this area. This funding builds on Canada&#x2019;s earlier contributions, including $2 million (CAD $3 million) provided in April 2024 and the donation of 900 Canadian-built SkyRanger drones, of which 560 have already reached Ukraine. Since February 2022, Canada has provided $3.1 billion (CAD $4.5 billion) in military assistance to Ukraine. This support has included advanced weaponry, drones, and vehicles. Minister Blair added that deliveries of approximately 1,300 CRV-7 rocket warheads were completed in December 2024, following the shipment of over 2,000 rocket motors earlier in the year. The first batch of Armoured Combat Support Vehicles arrived in the fall, with training completed, and an additional 40 vehicles are set for delivery by the end of 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/canada-to-allocate-305-million-in-military-assistance-to-ukraine/	2025-01-09T14:55:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/bill-blair.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine's 47th Brigade releases video of 'massive' Russian attack repelled in Kursk Oblast	Key developments on Jan. 9: Ukraine&apos;s 47th Mechanized Brigade said on Jan. 9 that it had, together with other units, repelled a &quot;massive&quot; Russian assault in the embattled Kursk Oblast, releasing footage of the engagement. The report came days after Ukraine reportedly launched renewed offensive operations in Kursk Oblast, which is seen as a crucial bargaining chip for potential peace negotiations. Almost 50 Russian ground assaults were repelled in Kursk Oblast over the past day, the General Staff said. The Russian attack reportedly involved about 50 vehicles, including tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, and buggies. According to the brigade, Russian troops initially tried to demine the approaches to Ukrainian positions and attacked in six waves. Russia deployed &quot;a huge number of soldiers,&quot; with Ukrainian forces killing 45 troops and injuring 53, the military claimed. 0:00/1&#xD7;The footage shared on Jan. 9, 2025, purporting to show Ukrainian forces repelling a Russian attack in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast (Ukraine&apos;s 47th Mechanized Brigade/Telegram)&quot;Tanks, BMP-2, BMD, APCs (armored personnel carriers), buggies and Lancets &#x2014; our soldiers and comrades burned Russian equipment worth tens of millions of dollars,&quot; the brigade said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. No further details on the attack were disclosed. The Russian military has not commented on Ukraine&apos;s claim. Ukrainian forces launched a large-scale operation in Kursk Oblast in early August, allegedly capturing up to 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian soil. Since then, Russia has deployed reinforcements &#x2014; including North Korean soldiers &#x2014; in the area and reportedly retook around half of the lost territory. North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian forces against Ukraine have suffered 4,000 casualties, both wounded and killed, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on Jan. 9 at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, Interfax Ukraine reported. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claim. The claim comes as North Korea has deepened its military ties with Moscow. Dorothy Camille Shea, the U.S. deputy ambassador to the U.N., said on Jan. 8 that more than 12,000 North Korean troops were in Russia. &quot;Putin is not just maintaining his investment in aggression. He&apos;s doubling down. He&apos;s even started hiring soldiers from North Korea to keep this war going,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;North Korea is learning modern methods of warfare. They do not value their people. They have lost 4,000 people so far.&quot; North Korea&apos;s involvement is seen as mutually beneficial for Pyongyang and Moscow. Shea warned that North Korea is gaining &quot;valuable combat experience&quot; and receiving Russian military equipment and technology, which could enhance its capacity to wage war. Pyongyang reportedly deployed its troops to Kursk Oblast last fall to help counter a surprise Ukrainian incursion launched on Aug. 6. Ukrainian forces have continued to fight in the region, seeking to retain it as leverage for future negotiations with Russia. In his Jan. 5 interview with Lex Fridman, Zelensky also warned that Pyongyang could send an additional 30,000&#x2013;40,000 troops to the front. President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived at the Ramstein airbase in Germany on Jan. 9, delivering an opening address to the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting. Zelensky is expected to hold a series of bilateral meetings during the summit, which will be the last gathering in this format before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. &quot;It&apos;s clear that a new chapter starts for Europe and the entire world just 11 days from now, when we have to cooperate even more, rely on each other even more, and achieve greater results together,&quot; Zelensky said in his opening address alongside outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. Trump&apos;s imminent return to the White House has caused concern about the future of U.S. support for Ukraine, as the president-elect has often criticized the Biden administration&apos;s assistance provided to Kyiv. During the meeting, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a $500 million aid package for Ukraine, including air defense missiles, ammunition, and equipment for F-16 fighter jets. Around $3.8 billion remains allocated under the presidential drawdown authority (PDA), leaving it uncertain whether Trump will continue using this tool to funnel arms to Ukraine. Speaking at the meeting, Zelensky urged the allies not to relent in helping Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. &quot;We&apos;ve come such a long way that it would honestly be crazy to drop the ball now and not keep building on the defense coalitions we&apos;ve created,&quot; the president noted. The UDCG comprises 57 countries, including all 32 NATO members, and was formed in April 2022 to coordinate international support for Ukraine. Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz implied earlier this week that the Jan. 9 meeting might be the last one in the current format. Zelensky highlighted bilateral security agreements Ukraine has concluded with individual countries and called on allies to invest in Ukraine&apos;s defense industry, namely in developing drone capabilities. Ukraine&apos;s head of state further pointed to Russian hybrid operations targeting NATO countries, mentioning recent reports of damaged undersea cables or &quot;destabilization efforts in Africa.&quot; &quot;We are also learning more about how Russian intelligence paid militants in Afghanistan to target coalition soldiers when your troops were present there... American soldiers, NATO country soldiers. How can this be forgiven or forgotten?&quot; Zelensky asked. The Insider recently published an investigation into Russian military intelligence (GRU) allegedly paying off terrorist groups in Afghanistan to attack coalition soldiers. Trump, who was president when the U.S. intelligence pointing to Russian-sponsored killings surfaced in 2020, was at the time criticized for inaction and for doubting the reports. Ukraine is negotiating with the U.S. to obtain licenses to manufacture air defense systems and missiles on its territory, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 9. Zelensky made this statement at the opening of the 25th Ramstein summit, which was dedicated to strengthening Ukraine&apos;s defenses, particularly its air defense. This summit will be the last gathering in this format before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. &quot;We are talking to the U.S. about licensing air defense systems and missile production here in Ukraine. And this could become a significant part of our security guarantees. And it is absolutely possible to do it,&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky mentioned the Russian Jan. 8 attack on Zaporizhzhia, which killed 13 people and injured more than 100, and called for additional air defense systems for Ukraine. &quot;This is just one day, just one attack, just one air strike. We need to stop the Russian terror. And you can do it. We ask for immediate delivery of air defense systems,&quot; the president said. In December 2024, Zelensky said he had repeatedly asked the U.S. to provide licenses to produce Patriot systems in Ukraine but had not received permission. &quot;I have asked the U.S. many times to grant licenses for the production of the Patriot (air defense system). No one seemed to mind. No one has ever told me: &apos;No, we won&apos;t give you one.&apos; But so far, we have not received anything,&quot; Zelensky told Le Parisien on Dec. 18. The president added that in the three years of war, Ukraine has not yet received the number of air defense systems it needs to defend itself against Russia. Outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced on Jan. 9 a $500 million aid package for Ukraine, including air defense missiles, ammunition, and equipment for F-16 fighter jets. The package was unveiled at the Ramstein summit in Germany. It is expected to be the final U.S. defense tranche provided by the Biden administration before Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Trump&apos;s imminent return to the White House has caused concern about the future of U.S. support for Ukraine, as the president-elect has often criticized the Biden administration&apos;s assistance provided to Kyiv. The incoming U.S. leadership changes have also cast doubt on the future of the Ramstein-format Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG), a coalition of 57 countries that has been coordinating aid for Ukraine since April 2022. &quot;Month after month, members of this Contact Group have helped provide, produce, and sustain the systems and the munitions that Ukraine needs,&quot; Austin said in his address to the meeting alongside President Volodymyr Zelensky and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. &quot;So we must not let up. That&apos;s why I am announcing today another presidential drawdown authority package valued at approximately $500 million. &quot;It includes additional missiles for Ukrainian air defense, more ammunition, and more air-to-ground munitions and other equipment to support Ukraine&apos;s F-16s.&quot; Around $3.8 billion remains allocated for Ukraine under the presidential drawdown authority, which enables Washington to provide arms and equipment to Kyiv directly from the Pentagon&apos;s stocks. The future of these funds under the incoming Trump administration is uncertain. Austin, who is attending the summit for the last time as defense secretary, highlighted the Ramstein group&apos;s progress over its more than two-and-a-half years of existence, including the formation of eight &quot;capability coalitions&quot; led by 14 countries and Ukraine. &quot;Earlier today, the Coalition Leadership Group met again... And they endorsed Capability Coalition roadmaps leading to the year 2027,&quot; Austin said. According to the outgoing defense secretary, the UDCG countries have committed more than $122 billion worth of assistance throughout the full-scale war. &quot;Here is the fundamental truth: Ukraine&apos;s fight matters to all of us. As I said here in Ramstein back at our first meeting in April 2022, Putin&apos;s war &apos;is a challenge to free people everywhere.&apos;&quot; Ukraine is prepared to provide jobs at defense enterprises for citizens abroad and exempt them from the mobilization of conscripts, National Unity Minister Oleksii Chernyshov said on Jan. 8, as reported by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. &quot;We have a shortage of professionals, and Ukraine is ready to exempt most of them from military service,&quot; Chernyshov said. To address this need, the Ukrainian government plans to establish centers to assist citizens abroad in finding jobs in both Ukraine and their current countries of residence, he added. These centers aim to guide individuals toward career paths that can benefit Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industry. Chernyshov expressed confidence that many Ukrainians would take advantage of these opportunities. Neighboring countries, including Poland and Lithuania, have suggested they may assist Ukraine in facilitating the return of fighting-aged men, though no concrete measures have been announced. Meanwhile, nations like Germany and Estonia have extended temporary residency permits for Ukrainian refugees, even in cases where passports have expired. Ukraine lowered its mobilization age from 27 to 25 in April 2024 but has resisted calls from international partners to reduce it further to 18. These new initiatives reflect the government&apos;s efforts to balance workforce needs in critical sectors with national defense requirements.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraines-47th-brigade-releases-video-of-massive-russian-attack-repelled-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-01-09T13:54:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/--------------2025-01-09-142759.png
Trump revises Ukraine peace timeline, FT reports	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has revised his campaign promise to end the war in Ukraine within &quot;24 hours,&quot; now suggesting a timeline of several months. European officials view this adjustment as an indication that his administration will not immediately withdraw support for Kyiv. Two European officials told the Financial Times that recent discussions with Trump&#x2019;s incoming team revealed no concrete plan to resolve the war yet. They also emphasized that U.S. assistance to Ukraine would persist following Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on Jan. 20. &quot;The whole [Trump] team is obsessed with strength and looking strong, so they&#x2019;re recalibrating the Ukraine approach,&quot; one official said. The official added that Trump&#x2019;s camp is cautious about avoiding comparisons with Joe Biden&#x2019;s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, which they do not want to see replicated in Ukraine. Earlier this week, Trump said a six-month timeline was more realistic for ending the war. Meanwhile, his designated envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, set a goal of resolving the war within 100 days. &quot;I would like to set a goal on a personal and professional level &#x2014; I would set it at 100 days and move all the way back,&quot; Kellogg told Fox News. &quot;And figure a way we can do this in the near term, to make sure the solution is solid and it&#x2019;s sustainable and that this war ends so that we stop the carnage.&quot; European leaders are urging Trump and his team to maintain U.S. military aid to Ukraine, arguing that it is critical for Kyiv&#x2019;s defense and for compelling Moscow to engage in peace talks. French officials noted last month that halting Russia&#x2019;s advances in eastern Ukraine is essential to any negotiation, as discussions are unlikely while Moscow continues to gain territory. Washington&#x2019;s military support remains a cornerstone of Ukraine&apos;s defense, complemented by European contributions of weapons and financial aid. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who recently met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, dismissed concerns that the U.S. might abandon Ukraine. Meloni stressed that Ukraine must receive concrete security guarantees as part of any diplomatic resolution to the war. &quot;Security guarantees are fundamental if we actually aspire to have peace in Ukraine,&quot; she reportedly said. &quot;We all know that in the past Russia has violated the agreements that it has signed. Without security guarantees, we cannot have certainty that will not happen again.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky continues to advocate for a firm timeline for Ukraine to join NATO as part of these guarantees. However, both Trump and outgoing President Joe Biden have expressed reservations about such a commitment, and some European leaders, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, share their hesitancy. French President Emmanuel Macron has proposed deploying European troops to Ukraine to prevent future Russian aggression, though this idea lacks consensus among European nations. The Kremlin said earlier that President Vladimir Putin is open to dialogue with Trump and would welcome his approach. Putin&#x2019;s main objectives in any talks include ensuring Ukraine never joins NATO and negotiating a reduction of NATO&#x2019;s military presence in Eastern Europe. &quot;He wants to change the rules of the international order so there are no threats to Russia,&quot; a former senior Kremlin official said. &quot;Trump wants to roll back NATO anyway. The world is changing; anything can happen.&quot; NATO leaders, including Secretary-General Mark Rutte, have urged Trump to prioritize &quot;peace through strength&quot; in Ukraine, warning that a settlement unfavorable to Kyiv could embolden adversaries like Putin, China&#x2019;s Xi Jinping, North Korea&#x2019;s Kim Jong Un, and Iran.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-revises-ukraine-peace-timeline-ft-reports/	2025-01-09T13:32:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-996942026.jpg
Syria reportedly blocks evacuation of Russian military equipment from naval base	The new Syrian authorities have refused to grant entry to a ship that was supposed to evacuate Russian military equipment from Russia&apos;s Tartus naval base in Syria, The Moscow Times reported on Jan. 9. The refusal follows the December overthrow of Russian-backed dictator Bashar al-Assad by rebel forces, marking a significant shift in Syria&#x2019;s political landscape. The Sparta II, a Russian cargo ship under U.S. sanctions, has been drifting near Tartus since Jan. 5 after leaving Baltiysk in Kaliningrad Oblast on Dec. 11, according to the Moscow Times. Reports indicate that Russian forces have dismantled air defense radars and moved over 100 trucks of equipment to the port. No ships are currently docked to facilitate the evacuation, leaving personnel and equipment stranded. Without clearance from the new Syrian government, the evacuation of Russia&apos;s military assets from Tartus has stalled, according to Maritime Executive. The Khmeimim Air Base, serviced by Russian Defense Ministry flights, reportedly remains the only active evacuation route. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha addressed Russia&#x2019;s military presence in Syria during a Dec. 30 diplomatic visit to Damascus. According to Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi, Ukraine and the new Syrian leadership share similar views on the matter, though specific details were not disclosed.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-evacuation-efforts-stalled-as-new-syrian-leaders-deny-port-access-media-reports/	2025-01-09T13:16:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2189980735.jpg
EU ready to lead in Ukraine support if US steps back, chief diplomat says	The European Union is prepared to take a leading role in supporting Ukraine if U.S. backing wanes, EU chief diplomat Kaja Kallas said on Jan. 9 at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, German media outlet Tagesschau reported. &quot;If the United States is not ready for it, the European Union is ready to take the lead,&quot; Kallas said. President-elect Donald Trump and his team have expressed skepticism about the ongoing financial U.S. support for Ukraine.

Trump has pledged to bring a swift end to the war but has yet to provide detailed plans for achieving peace.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-ready-to-lead-in-ukraine-support-if-us-steps-back-kallas-says/	2025-01-09T12:06:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1238851132-1.jpg
Lacking manpower to hold back Russia, Ukraine turns to its crack drone units	Editor&#x2019;s note: This story contains scenes and images that some readers might find disturbing. In accordance with the security protocols of the Ukrainian military, soldiers featured in this story are identified by first names and callsigns only. KUPIANSK AREA, Kharkiv Oblast &#x2013; Snow, sleet, fog, the lot; when the weather is at its worst is when Russian soldiers tend to go out on assault. That&#x2019;s what the traditional wisdom dictates anyway: the harder it is for Ukrainian drones to watch and enter the battlefield, the more chances that small Russian infantry groups have of trudging their way to Ukrainian positions unscathed. After a day and night of steady snowfall, the sky begins to clear just before dawn, during the silent drive to Ukrainian drone positions south of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast. Closer to the ground though, a stubborn layer of fog continues to hang, through which hares and deer can be seen bouncing out of the way of the drab green pick-up truck. The drone team wakes up around six in the morning. Though less than two kilometers from Russian positions themselves, they have set up a comfy dugout, complete with bunk beds and a heavy-duty gas heater. &#x201C;We&apos;ll have a more or less quiet day,&#x201D; says Oleksandr &#x201C;Skhid,&#x201D; the 26-year-old commander and navigator, as he opens his work laptop in the dugout, &#x201C;but since there&apos;s fog, it means that more of their infantry will be able to slip through, as there isn&apos;t very strong surveillance on our side right now.&#x201D; &#x201C;The last time we had a major mechanized assault there was bad weather.&#x201D; As the rest of the four-person team is still getting out of bed, it quickly becomes clear that the day will be far from quiet. A group of about six Russian infantrymen has been spotted by colleagues in reconnaissance, creeping forward through a snowy tree line. &#x201C;Copy, we&#x2019;ll get to work,&#x201D; Skhid relays to his commander. Having barely got out of bed, Yaroslav &#x201C;Strilok&#x201D; heads to the neighboring dugout to arm and prepare the weapon of choice: a seven-inch first-person view (FPV) drone with a custom-made fragmentation munition ziptied to the bottom. Pilot Vladyslav &#x201C;Skuba&#x201D; sits down in a lawn chair next to Skhid and dons the ubiquitous goggles, preparing to transport his human vision and dexterity inside a high-precision weapon. Skhid, meanwhile, is honing in on the location of the Russian soldiers, given away by their bright thermal signatures in the winter twilight. Within a few minutes, drones are in the air, with just about four minutes of flying between them and their targets.

(Aria Shahrokhshahi/The Kyiv Independent)This FPV team belongs to the Achilles Strike Drone Battalion, part of Ukraine&#x2019;s 92nd Assault Brigade, and one of the most effective drone units in the country. Initially forming as a ragtag drone reconnaissance group in May 2022 under the command of Kyiv City Council member Yuriy Fedorenko, the unit became one of Ukraine&#x2019;s first official strike drone companies in February 2023. Over the following year, with the use of drones surging on both sides of the war, Achilles forged this new type of unit with a personalized, systematized approach, from the training of the steady stream of new recruits to the organization of battlefield work. Less than a year later, the company became a battalion and is now looking to expand further to the regiment level. The rapid evolution and expansion of Ukraine&#x2019;s best drone units comes at a tumultuous time: as the country struggles against dire shortages in combat-effective infantry and Moscow looks to press its advantage ahead of the return of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency. After two years of heavy fighting, since the area was liberated from Russian occupation in September 2022, Russian forces have made major inroads in Ukraine&#x2019;s defense of Kupiansk, reaching the Oskil River to the city&#x2019;s south in October last year. Whether it&#x2019;s FPV suicide drones or makeshift bombers, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are now often taking the lion&#x2019;s share of the task of stopping Russian assaults upon themselves. In this context, the work of next-generation soldiers like Skhid and his team is key. Still, the results are a confronting glimpse at the future of war: where everything that moves can be the target of a cheap, high-precision manhunt. &#x201C;There he is, just to the right!&#x201D; It isn&#x2019;t long after the drone reaches the tree line that Skhid spots the first enemy infantryman in the tree line on the first-person feed. By now, the Russian soldier knows he is being hunted; the chaotic screeches of an FPV are nothing like the steady whir of a reconnaissance drone, and grow deafeningly loud the closer the drone gets. Skuba looks for a way to close the distance, something that is much easier said than done in the circumstances. Touching any stray branch can easily bring down the fragile quadcopter, but hovering for too long in search of an opening also gives the targets the chance to shoot down the drone with a well-aimed rifle burst. In civilian life, Skuba lived with his young family in Bucha outside Kyiv, working as a programmer and learning the piano in his free time. Like almost all pilots like him in the military, he first learned the intricate art of FPV piloting on a computer simulator, before graduating to physical drones when he joined Achilles in the summer of 2024. Unlike commercial camera drones like the DJI Mavic model commonly used for reconnaissance, FPV drones have no in-built stabilizers: even the smallest jerk of the copter &#x2014; up, down, left, right, around &#x2014; is the result of the most delicate of manual adjustments by the pilot. &#x201C;It&apos;s a somewhat specific job,&#x201D; said Skuba. &#x201C;It&apos;s a balance between being careful enough, fast enough, and maneuvering through obstacles in the air.&#x201D; Yaroslav &quot;Strilok,&quot; a soldier of the Achilles Strike Drone Battalion, carries a first-person view drone at positions near Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast, on Dec. 8, 2025. (Aria Shahrokhshahi/The Kyiv Independent)Having made it through the bushes, the drone bears down on the enemy. The last second of the FPV&#x2019;s video feed shows neither fight nor flight, as the Russian soldier simply keels over onto the ground with his back to his attacker. The video cuts out on impact. &#x201C;Was there an explosion?&#x201D; Skhid asks rhetorically, waiting to see the hit from the view of the reconnaissance drone. But the livestream, delayed by a few seconds, shows no explosion. &#x201C;Looks like it was a dud,&#x201D; mutters Skhid. &#x201C;Strilok, another one!&#x201D; he shouts immediately in the direction of the other dugout. Barely able to take his goggles off before the next flight, Skuba has no time for frustration; within two minutes, the drone heads out again to the same spot. This time, after a similar dance between the trees, Skuba dives in again, and this time the munition detonates. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video of a drone strike on a Russian soldier (as described in story) near Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast, on Dec. 8, 2025. (Courtesy of Achilles Strike Drone Battalion, 92nd Separate Assault Brigade)After a puff of grey smoke on the reconnaissance stream, the Russian infantryman lays still, face down amongst the bare trees. &#x201C;The mood constantly shifts, from one successful strike to the next failure, and so on, and so on,&#x201D; said Skuba. &#x201C;It&apos;s like a rollercoaster.&#x201D; Of the initial group of six Russian soldiers, two were killed in the morning&#x2019;s work, while the rest managed to scatter and take cover. With no more thermal signatures in the tree line, the team finally has time to make their first coffee of the day. Not long after the first mission, the order comes out to fly out again: the reconnaissance team has discovered how the Russian infantry got to the tree line. Two Russian armored vehicles, a BMP infantry fighting vehicle and MT-LB armored personnel carrier, stand still at an intersection in the field. &#x201C;This is the first mechanized attack we have seen in this area in a long time, maybe about six weeks,&#x201D; says Skhid. This is a common job for an FPV team: to destroy disabled and abandoned vehicles on the battlefield before Russian forces get a chance to evacuate and repair them. Inside the other dugout, Strilok prepares the munitions for the flight: first the drone, then the bomb, and finally, arming the crude wire initiator system which allows the suicide drone to detonate on impact. Dancing around the dark underground space, the bright beam of his headlamp reveals the scale of the arsenal at the team&#x2019;s disposal: over 150 kamikaze drones stacked up on shelves and ammunition boxes along the earthen walls. Each of these drones costs about $300-500: not cheap, but still a much more affordable fire asset than, for example, a Western-made 155mm howitzer shell, which usually costs about 10 times as much. First introduced to the battlefield in early 2023, the use of FPVs has been upscaled by both sides to dizzying heights. After a pledge made at the end of 2023 by President Volodymyr Zelensky to produce one million drones in the next year, Ukraine managed to not only hit but exceed the target, with Defense Minister Rustem Umerov declaring in December last year that over 1.5 million FPVs were delivered by the state in 2024. While the kamikaze drones were first used mainly for enemy vehicles, by mid-2024, top flight units like Achilles had more than enough to spend two or more each on a single enemy infantryman. A stack of first-person view suicide drones stored in a dugout of the Achilles Strike Drone Battalion near Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast, on Dec. 8, 2025. (Aria Shahrokhshahi/The Kyiv IndependentTall and quiet with a long scraggly beard, 28-year-old Strilok served for over a year as an assault soldier in the 92nd brigade upon the outset of the full-scale invasion, fighting tooth and nail against soldiers from Russia&#x2019;s Wagner mercenary group at the height of the Battle of Bakhmut. After being seriously wounded on the battlefield back in 2023, the Kharkiv Oblast native was discharged and could have sat out the rest of the war, but chose to rejoin the fray in a less physically demanding role. &#x201C;Back then, I only heard about FPVs a few times,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;there were Mavics dropping bombs, but it was mostly artillery, mortars, grenade launchers firing at us.&#x201D; Once Skuba&#x2019;s drone reaches the spot on the map, he picks his target: the MT-LB. Normally, this would be an easier task than hunting a moving target; the vehicles&#x2019; electronic warfare systems have run out of charge, allowing him to approach and choose his angle of attack with a high-quality video feed. Still, it is easier said than done: the MT-LB has been fitted with a chaotic array of makeshift drone protection, with cages, chains, and sheet metal crudely welded to the vehicle on all sides. &#xA0; More puffs of smoke on the video feed show that Achilles is not the only drone unit targeting the vehicles: other teams from neighboring brigades are also at work, competing in real time to get the coveted video of destroyed armor to add to their personal accounts. For a skilled pilot like Skuba, it&#x2019;s just another challenge: his first attempt lands just short, but the second is flawless: weaving through a literal chink in the armor, he dips the drone right into the open hatch, and within a few minutes, the MT-LB is in flames. &#x201C;I like how it burns,&#x201D; jokes Skhid, repeating a viral phrase used by Ukrainians to describe any juicy strike on a Russian target. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video of a drone strike on a Russian armored vehicle (as described in story) near Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast, on Dec. 8, 2025. (Courtesy of Achilles Strike Drone Battalion, 92nd Separate Assault Brigade)Across the front line in eastern Ukraine, Russia continues to use a mix of armored attacks and creeping waves of squad-level infantry assaults to storm Ukrainian positions. Unable to conduct effective combined arms offensives on a larger scale, Russian forces&#x2019; tactics often amount to simply getting as many bodies upfield as quickly as possible to overwhelm the Ukrainian defense. &#x201C;They have their pre-ordained routes, along which their infantry moves forward, position by position,&#x201D; said Skhid. &#x201C;We know where these positions are, and we are always watching them. As soon as our reconnaissance sees a group or even just a couple of them, we get to work.&#x201D; &#x201C;Some tree lines are just littered with corpses&#x2026; quite often, it happens that you&apos;re flying and can&apos;t even tell whether it&apos;s already a dead body that&apos;s been lying there for a while or someone just pretending to be dead.&#x201D; As heavy as the Russian losses are, against an overstretched Ukrainian defending force suffering severe shortages in infantry, it often works. &#x201C;It&apos;s good that there&#x2019;s more equipment, and more drones,&#x201D; said Strilok, &#x201C;and our artillery has been working much better.&#x201D; &#x201C;It&#x2019;s bad that there&#x2019;s no infantry, this is really bad.&#x201D; Over 2024, Ukraine&#x2019;s most consistent problem on the battlefield has indeed been manpower, with the third year of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war bringing with it mounting casualties and desertion rates, especially in the infantry. With the tough conditions and danger to life in the infantry well-known in society, those still joining the army voluntarily rather than through mobilization are much more likely to enter the new growth sector: drones. As a result, in the absence of a properly manned defense, it is often the presence of well-equipped crack drone units like Achilles that makes the difference between Russian attacks being eliminated in the field and gaining ground in a given area. If a sector can be saturated with enough eyes in the sky through night and day, coupled with strike teams like Skhid&#x2019;s, Ukrainian forces have a much better chance of knocking out entire Russian assault formations before the lack of defending infantry becomes a problem. But in the long term, said Skhid, there is still no replacement for the simple foot soldier. &#x201C;Right now, we&#x2019;re seeing a very heavy concentration of drones in this sector &#x2014; not just from our unit,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We have relatively extensive observation here, and there are many people working with all different types of drones.&#x201D; &#xA0; &#x201C;But if there isn&#x2019;t someone physically sitting in the tree line, we won&#x2019;t be able to achieve much. We can&#x2019;t just park a drone there to hold and defend a specific tree line. It&#x2019;s a massive combination of different elements.&#x201D; After a quick lunch of ready-to-eat beef and buckwheat stew, more Russians are spotted in the foggy livestream. This time, the infantrymen &#x2014; three of them &#x2014; aren&#x2019;t sticking to the tree line, but strolling single file through an open field. Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. The team wastes no time: Strilok arms the drone and brings it to the launch platform outside, Skuba dons his goggles and lifts off, while Skhid keeps a keen eye on his target. Surviving a precision attack from an FPV drone is one of the most terrifying and difficult challenges for an infantryman fighting in this 21st-century war, and a far cry from the threat of artillery, which at least has much more luck involved. Just like with artillery, there is no substitute for hard cover, but if available, thick vegetation is always a good option, providing protection from view and entangling the drone&#x2019;s propellers on approach. But in an open field, there are only two options, neither of which are easy: dodge, and hope the pilot misses, or try to shoot one&#x2019;s nimble attacker out of the air. Drone pilot Vladyslav &quot;Skuba&quot; flying a first-person view drone inside a dugout near Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast, on Dec. 8, 2025. (Aria Shahrokhshahi/The Kyiv Independent)The first infantryman fails to do either. Running in a straight line, he makes an easy target for Skuba, who does not miss. After the hit is confirmed on the livestream, he squirms for a few more seconds before lying still. Straight away, the next drone takes off. Skuba doesn&#x2019;t remove his goggles, transporting his eyes straight into the camera of the next quadcopter as they sync automatically. By now, the Russian assault group knows they are under attack, but continues marching forward anyway. The second Russian soldier opts for the dodging method, with some success. After several unsuccessful passes, the suicide drone explodes on the ground a meter and a half away from his feet. He rises from the ground, disoriented but still carrying his rifle, and begins limping, clearly hurt badly by shrapnel. &#xA0; &#x201C;It&apos;s still not always easy, but with each trip, it gets calmer,&#x201D; said Skuba of his work. &#x201C;You start seeing them as a target, you figure out how to approach, you plan your route. The more you know, the more you organize everything, the easier it is to take it step by step.&#x201D; The last member of the Russian assault team is running for cover as the third drone arrives, having shown no interest in helping his wounded comrade. Unlike the others, this one decides to shoot. Turning over his shoulder, the Russian soldier faces the drone, raises his Kalashnikov rifle, and in a split second, Skuba&#x2019;s FPV video feed cuts out. Remarkably, the second attempt to target the soldier is met with the same result. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s a bloody sniper, f***!&#x201D; shouts Skhid in frustration. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video of a drone strike on a Russian soldier (as described in story) near Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast, on Dec. 8, 2025. (Courtesy of Achilles Strike Drone Battalion, 92nd Separate Assault Brigade)More and more, soldiers on both sides have begun to carry shotguns out on missions specifically for protection against drones, but shooting an FPV out of the sky with a rifle while being actively targeted is no mean feat. Whether through luck or a mix of skill and ice-cold nerves, the Russian infantryman&#x2019;s sharpshooting gives him just enough time to make it to proper cover. With the light slowly fading on this short, grey day at war, Skuba flies out one more time to the same field. The wounded soldier is no longer limping. Laying on his back, but still moving, he could yet be evacuated and return to the fight. For Skhid, whose family home in Kharkiv Oblast is less than 50 kilometers from these positions, there is no taking chances. Skuba closes in, and after a direct hit to the torso, the Russian soldier&#x2019;s journey into Ukraine with an invading army meets its permanent end. &#xA0; &#x201C;Feelings sometimes rise up during work due to outside events,&#x201D; said Skuba of the emotional side of his often gruesome work, &#x201C;it could be something with family, with loved ones, a tragedy related to the war. All of that can accumulate, of course, and some anger, resentment toward the Russians builds up.&#x201D; &#x201C;But sometimes&#x2026; sometimes it&#x2019;s just zen, it&#x2019;s just this smooth, constant work. We see the targets, and we engage them.&#x201D; Hi, this is Francis Farrell, the author of this piece. It&apos;s quite a rare thing that as a journalist spending just a day with soldiers, that you are witness to this much action. What I saw in my time with Achilles is proof of two things: first, how damn good these guys are at their jobs, and second, how damn good Russia is at throwing endless waves of humans at Ukrainian defenses. This type of cyberpunk battlefield matchup could be defining for the war in 2025. Whatever ends up happening, you can count on the fact that we will take you right there. &#xA0;Please consider supporting our reporting.	https://kyivindependent.com/lacking-manpower-to-hold-back-russia-ukraine-turns-to-its-crack-drone-units/	2025-01-09T11:19:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/DSCF6208.jpg
Zelensky, NATO chief discuss air defense, arms production at Ramstein meeting	President Volodymyr Zelensky met with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at Ramstein Air Base in Germany on Jan. 9 to discuss strengthening Ukraine&apos;s air defense and obtaining Western funding for the country&apos;s arms production. &quot;The common task of our partners is to ensure a strong position for Ukraine to achieve a just and lasting peace. Today, we also discussed how NATO&apos;s platform can be used to reach this goal,&quot; Zelensky said. Rutte reiterated the alliance&apos;s unwavering support for Kyiv. &quot;NATO is committed to continuing our support as you defend yourselves and fight tirelessly for the freedom we all hold dear,&quot; he said. Zelensky emphasized involving NATO members in purchasing Ukrainian weapons under a model pioneered by Denmark. The Danish government became the first country to offer to donate arms to Ukraine via direct purchases from the Ukrainian defense industry, as Kyiv&apos;s defense budget does not match the capacities of domestic weapons production. Zelensky also met with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, focusing on battlefield dynamics, the evolving role of drones, and Ukraine&apos;s needs for various drone types. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG), formed in April 2022 and comprising 57 countries, including all 32 NATO members, coordinates international military aid to Ukraine. This meeting is expected to be the last in its current format before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said on Jan. 8. During the meeting, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a $500 million aid package for Ukraine, which includes air defense missiles, ammunition, and equipment for F-16 fighter jets. Zelensky is also scheduled for bilateral meetings during the summit, continuing efforts to bolster international support for Ukraine as the country seeks a stronger defense position and a pathway toward a just peace	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-nato-chief-discuss-air-defense-arms-cooperation-at-ramstein-meeting/	2025-01-09T10:42:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/dbb31c1780fefd0b47d00e3b51938b1b_1736432495.jpeg
Russia’s gas sector is running out of options after end of transit deal	Ukraine&#x2019;s decision to end the gas transit deal with Russian energy giant Gazprom has been hailed by President Volodymyr Zelensky as one of Moscow&#x2019;s biggest defeats. &quot;When (Russian President) Vladimir Putin was handed power in Russia over 25 years ago, the annual gas pumping through Ukraine to Europe stood at over 130 billion cubic meters. Today, the transit of Russian gas is zero. This is one of Moscow&apos;s biggest defeats,&quot; Zelensky said on Jan. 1 just as the deal expired. Moscow and Kyiv signed the agreement in 2019 to transit 40 billion cubic meters of Russian gas annually through Ukraine to buyers in the EU. Gazprom raked in an estimated $5&#x2013;$6.5 billion annually from the deal with Ukraine.Europe began to wean itself off Russian gas after Moscow&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine while Gazprom steadily reduced flows to the EU to pressure Ukraine&#x2019;s allies. Russian pipeline gas deliveries to Europe dropped to around 29 bcm last year with around 14 bcm traveling through Ukraine before Kyiv terminated the deal, according to Argus Media, a market analyst group. The Ukrainian route transited nearly half of Russia&#x2019;s pipeline gas exports to Europe, while the rest went through the TurkStream pipeline in the Balkans. Kyiv&#x2019;s decision to end the deal will further undermine gas revenue to Russia&#x2019;s economy as Moscow will struggle to find alternatives to replace this lost gas market in the near future. For now, Russia still has its claws on Europe with cheap liquified natural gas (LNG) and growing gas transit through the TurkStream pipeline. Those two revenue streams could run out, however, as sanctions bite and Europe looks to continue distancing itself from Russian energy. The majority of European states have already looked to gas alternatives from the U.S., Norway, and Algeria to reduce dependency on Russia. The end of the agreement forces those who clung to the Ukraine route, namely Slovakia, Hungary, and Austria, to find other options. &#x201C;This development is a step toward a Europe that is less susceptible to energy blackmail, marking a geopolitical win for Ukraine and its allies,&#x201D; the former head of Ukraine&#x2019;s gas transport operator (GTSOU) Sergiy Makogon told the Kyiv Independent. The last three years have put a &#x201C;significant strain&#x201D; on Gazprom, Makogon noted. The company suffered a sharp reduction in gas production from 515 bcm in 2021 to 355 bcm in 2023, which it largely blamed on Europe&#x2019;s move away from Russian gas, while also paying hefty taxes to prop up Moscow&#x2019;s war machine. Europe&#x2019;s efforts to wean itself off Russian gas meant volumes dropped from 150 bcm pre-war to less than 50 bcm in 2023, EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson said on Sept. 11, 2024. The end of the Ukraine route is another amputation for Gazprom after the loss of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and the Yamal pipeline through Poland in 2022. &#x201C;Moscow has limited options for now to sell more gas to other markets to make up for the loss of Ukrainian transit,&#x201D; Natasha Fielding, the head of European gas pricing at Argus Media, told the Kyiv Independent. Russia&#x2019;s final lifeline to Europe is the TurkStream pipeline that delivers Russian gas to Greece, the Western Balkans, and Hungary via Turkey. TurkStream is sanctioned by the U.S. and a Dutch court withdrew the export license of the Netherlands-based Russian company operating the pipeline in September 2022 but renewed it weeks later following pressure from Moscow and Budapest.

Serbia announced it had begun delivering natural gas to Europe through the TurkStream pipeline via a new route crossing Turkey and Bulgaria. (Serbian Presidency / Handout / Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)&#x201C;Europe can completely phase out Russian pipeline gas including by stopping the TurkStream pipeline,&#x201D; said Martin Vladimirov, the Director of the Energy and Climate Program at the Center for the Study of Democracy (CSD). Even if Europe does not embargo TurkStream, there is little room for more gas to flow through the pipeline. Deliveries jumped from 12.2 bcm in 2023 to 14.95 bcm in 2024, but the pipeline has a maximum capacity of 15.75 bcm per year, Fielding notes. Zelensky also mentioned the possibility of increasing U.S. gas imports to Europe which would lower prices. If the U.S. boosts LNG exports by 22.5 bcm this year, it would &#x201C;wipe out&#x201D; Russian pipeline gas supply in Central and Eastern Europe, said Vladimirov. Even China, which overtook Europe as the biggest guzzler of Russian pipeline gas last year, consuming 31 bcm, is a limited market for now, Fielding said. Russia cannot reroute gas flows through the 38 bcm &#x201C;Power of Siberia&#x201D; pipeline as it is not connected to the gas fields serving Europe and its transit already hit full capacity in December. Russia&#x2019;s two future pipeline projects with China are also yet to get off the ground. &#x201C;Russia will find it hard to get to pre-war gas export levels even if it is able to redirect exports to Asia after potentially losing all gas exports to Europe by the end of the decade,&#x201D; Vladimirov said. Russia&#x2019;s main LNG company, Novatek, has hooked European companies on its cheap LNG with 20% discounts leading to record-high purchases in 2024 of nearly 17 million tons, according to the CSD. While Brussels has not directly banned the chilled Russian fuel, it has sanctioned LNG transshipment &#x2014; transferring LNG from one ship to another&#x2014; making it harder for Moscow to sell beyond the European market. This could have helped spike Russian LNG sales to the EU, said Georg Zachmann, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a think tank, and at the Helmholtz Center Berlin, a research institute. The EU gobbled up 48% of Russia&#x2019;s total LNG exports in November 2024. One of the biggest consumers, France, imported Russian LNG worth 252 million euros ($262 million) during that month, according to the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). While less profitable than pipeline gas, Russia still makes close to $2 billion a month from its LNG sales to Asia and Europe, said Vladimirov. &#x201C;With no sanctions imposed on Russian LNG, companies are operating in their own self-interest and buying increasing quantities of gas from the cheapest supplier &#x2014; Russia,&#x201D; Vaibhav Raghunandan, EU-Russia Analyst at CREA, told the Kyiv Independent. Despite this, Russia&#x2019;s LNG sector is constrained. Its LNG terminals are already producing at near full capacity and it cannot easily reroute the gas originally transited through Ukraine to its two LNG export plants. In theory, Russia&#x2019;s new LNG export projects, like the Arctic LNG 2 project, could bolster sales abroad by 80 bcm, Vladimirov said. But Western sanctions on all new and future projects, including on Arctic LNG 2, are biting Moscow&#x2019;s progress by blocking its access to critical equipment like tankers and liquefaction technology.

(Kirill Morozov/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)The Arctic LNG 2 project was launched in late 2023 and aimed to produce 20 bcm of gas annually, but Novatek cut production to almost zero in November 2024. Novatek&#x2019;s setbacks show that &#x201C;it would be very difficult for Russia not only to complete the infrastructure but also buy the ice-breaker LNG carriers necessary to facilitate bigger exports to Asia,&#x201D; said Vladimirov. Moscow has increasingly relied on its shadow tankers to continue its LNG trade as sanctions hamper shipping logistics, he added. Finding secure buyers if output is increased will also be challenging, particularly if the EU heeds the calls to ban Russian LNG imports this year. Threats of secondary sanctions are also likely to turn off potential buyers. Russia paid Ukraine $800 million annually to transport its gas. However, net revenue only totaled between $200-300 million after transit costs, according to Makogon. Kyiv considered the economic consequences but ultimately made the decision to kill the deal in the &#x201C;interest of national security,&#x201D; the Energy Ministry told the Kyiv Independent. Moreover, it also undermines Russia&#x2019;s leverage on Europe&#x2019;s energy sector. &#x201C;Russia has used gas transit as both an economic and political weapon, influencing EU policies and creating divisions among member states,&#x201D; Makogon said. Europe will feel an expensive knock-on effect in exchange for its security, Fielding said, as Slovakia, Austria, and Czechia will have to pay more to source and transport non-Russian gas. Western Europe, particularly Germany, will have to increase gas flows to the east to replace the lost Russian gas, she added.

Germany continues to receive a significant portion of its natural gas from Russia, despite recent reductions in gas flow through pipelines, prompting warnings of potential shortages. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Slovakia, which could pay an extra 90 million euros to replace the Russian gas this year, has ramped up rhetoric against Ukraine with Prime Minister Robert Fico threatening to cut electricity exports to Ukraine last month. However, the country&#x2019;s electricity transmission system operator, SEPS, confirmed on Jan 4 that it will continue to send electricity to Ukraine. &#x201C;Slovakia and Austria had long prepared for this moment by signing contracts with alternative suppliers and keeping their underground gas reserves topped up. They must now put this plan into action,&#x201D; Fielding said. Ukraine is also preparing for Russia to attack its gas transit network in retaliation, said CEO of the GTSOU Dmytro Lyppa on Dec. 4. Russia has already relentlessly targeted Ukrainian energy infrastructure, including gas storage sites, and Makogon said that Ukraine is &#x201C;well prepared&#x201D; to repair and restore damaged infrastructure. &#x201C;Additionally, we would not hesitate to retaliate by targeting Russia&#x2019;s gas networks and storages, just as we have targeted their oil refineries,&#x201D; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-gas-sector-is-running-out-of-options-after-end-of-transit-deal/	2025-01-09T09:49:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1662623992.jpg
Slovak PM threatens Ukraine with aid cuts over halted Russian gas transit	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico escalated threats against Ukraine on Jan. 9, warning of severe consequences in response to Kyiv&#x2019;s suspension of Russian gas transit, Slovak media outlet Teraz.sk reported. He was speaking after talks with EU officials in Brussels. Kyiv terminated Russian gas transit on Jan. 1, citing its refusal to finance Russia&#x2019;s war. Slovakia, which had previously imported Russian gas through Ukraine, has voiced concerns over the decision&apos;s economic impact. Fico said that Slovakia could halt its humanitarian aid to Ukraine, cut or cancel social benefits for Ukrainian refugees, and cease emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine. He also suggested using Slovakia&apos;s veto power over EU decisions as leverage against Kyiv. The prime minister noted that these steps would only be taken if Slovakia &quot;has no other choice.&quot; Fico also announced the immediate formation of a working group comprising representatives from Slovakia, Ukraine, and the European Commission to address the issue. The Jan. 7 meeting between Slovak, Ukrainian, and European Commission representatives in Brussels was canceled after Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko remained in Kyiv to address urgent energy issues. Hungary has also expressed opposition to Ukraine&#x2019;s energy policies. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto criticized a Ukrainian parliamentary bill proposing a halt to Russian oil and gas transit during martial law, calling it &quot;unacceptable&quot; in a Jan. 8 Facebook post. Szijjarto underscored Hungary&apos;s power to influence Ukraine&#x2019;s EU aspirations, noting that all member states must unanimously approve new admissions. Since taking office, Fico has shifted Slovakia&#x2019;s foreign policy, halting military aid to Ukraine and adopting rhetoric more aligned with Russia, raising concerns among Kyiv and European partners. Despite the EU&#x2019;s push to cut reliance on Russian fossil fuels, Slovakia remains dependent on Russian gas, bound by a long-term contract with Gazprom, Moscow&apos;s state-owned energy giant.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovakia-threatens-ukraine-with-aid-cuts-over-halted-russian-gas-transit-pm-fico-says/	2025-01-09T09:20:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188638934.jpg
4,000 North Korean troops killed or wounded fighting against Ukraine, Zelensky claims	North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian forces against Ukraine have suffered 4,000 casualties, both wounded and killed, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on Jan. 9 at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, Interfax Ukraine reported. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claim. The claim comes as North Korea has deepened its military ties with Moscow. Dorothy Camille Shea, the U.S. deputy ambassador to the U.N., said on Jan. 8 that more than 12,000 North Korean troops were in Russia. &quot;Putin is not just maintaining his investment in aggression. He&apos;s doubling down. He&apos;s even started hiring soldiers from North Korea to keep this war going,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;North Korea is learning modern methods of warfare. They do not value their people. They have lost 4,000 people so far.&quot; North Korea&apos;s involvement is seen as mutually beneficial for Pyongyang and Moscow. Shea warned that North Korea is gaining &quot;valuable combat experience&quot; and receiving Russian military equipment and technology, which could enhance its capacity to wage war. Pyongyang reportedly deployed its troops to Kursk Oblast last fall to help counter a surprise Ukrainian incursion launched on Aug. 6. Ukrainian forces have continued to fight in the region, seeking to retain it as leverage for future negotiations with Russia. In his Jan. 5 interview with Lex Fridman, Zelensky also warned that Pyongyang could send an additional 30,000&#x2013;40,000 troops to the front.	https://kyivindependent.com/4-000-north-korean-troops-killed-or-wounded-fighting-in-ukraine-zelensky-claims/	2025-01-09T08:18:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2157765664.jpg
Ukraine offers defense industry jobs, draft exemptions for citizens abroad, minister says	Ukraine is prepared to provide jobs at defense enterprises for citizens abroad and exempt them from the mobilization of conscripts, National Unity Minister Oleksii Chernyshov said on Jan. 8, as reported by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. &quot;We have a shortage of professionals, and Ukraine is ready to exempt most of them from military service,&quot; Chernyshov said. To address this need, the Ukrainian government plans to establish centers to assist citizens abroad in finding jobs in both Ukraine and their current countries of residence, he added. These centers aim to guide individuals toward career paths that can benefit Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industry. Chernyshov expressed confidence that many Ukrainians would take advantage of these opportunities. Neighboring countries, including Poland and Lithuania, have suggested they may assist Ukraine in facilitating the return of fighting-aged men, though no concrete measures have been announced. Meanwhile, nations like Germany and Estonia have extended temporary residency permits for Ukrainian refugees, even in cases where passports have expired. Ukraine lowered its mobilization age from 27 to 25 in April 2024 but has resisted calls from international partners to reduce it further to 18. These new initiatives reflect the government&apos;s efforts to balance workforce needs in critical sectors with national defense requirements.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-offers-defense-industry-jobs-mobilization-exemptions-for-citizens-abroad-minister-says/	2025-01-09T07:17:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1246299242.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 8	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 8 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Jan. 1&#x2013;5, 2025. This newsletter was until recently titled &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief.&quot; The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Parliament may consider a draft law on establishing a new High Administrative Court The Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, is set to discuss revised draft law #12368 on establishing a new High Administrative Court during its Jan. 8-10, 2025 session. The bill, critical for meeting Ibenchmarks, awaits approval from the Committee on Legal Policy before proceeding to a vote. It remains unclear if Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament will address the revised draft law to repeal the &quot;Lozovyy amendments&quot; this week. ARMA Legislation Submitted The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has submitted draft law No. 12374 to amend the legislation governing the Asset Recovery and Management Agency (ARMA).

Kyiv, Washington in talks on licensing air defense production in Ukraine, Zelensky says	Ukraine is negotiating with the U.S. to obtain licenses to manufacture air defense systems and missiles on its territory, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 9. Zelensky made this statement at the opening of the 25th Ramstein summit, which was dedicated to strengthening Ukraine&apos;s defenses, particularly its air defense. This summit will be the last gathering in this format before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. &quot;We are talking to the U.S. about licensing air defense systems and missile production here in Ukraine. And this could become a significant part of our security guarantees. And it is absolutely possible to do it,&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky mentioned the Russian Jan. 8 attack on Zaporizhzhia, which killed 13 people and injured more than 100, and called for additional air defense systems for Ukraine. &quot;This is just one day, just one attack, just one air strike. We need to stop the Russian terror. And you can do it. We ask for immediate delivery of air defense systems,&quot; the president said. In December 2024, Zelensky said he had repeatedly asked the U.S. to provide licenses to produce Patriot systems in Ukraine but had not received permission. &quot;I have asked the U.S. many times to grant licenses for the production of Patriot (air defense system). No one seemed to mind. No one has ever told me: &apos;No, we won&apos;t give you one.&apos; But so far, we have not received anything,&quot; Zelensky told Le Parisien on Dec. 18. The president added that in the three years of war, Ukraine has not yet received the number of air defense systems it needs to defend itself against Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-washington-in-talks-on-air-defense-productions-licensing-in-ukraine-zelensky-says/	2025-01-09T06:02:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2156549690.jpg
Russia paid Taliban $200,000 per killed US, coalition soldier, media investigation says	Russia&apos;s military intelligence (GRU) offered a $200,000 bounty to Afghan militants for every U.S. or coalition soldier killed before Washington announced its withdrawal from the country, The Insider and Der Spiegel reported on Jan. 8. The joint media investigation sheds fresh details on reports of Russia-sponsored killings of U.S. soldiers that first surfaced in 2020, including names of Russian intelligence officers and their local collaborators involved. According to the investigation, the operation was overseen by Lieutenant General Ivan Kasyanenko, deputy commander of Unit 29155, a notorious group connected to Sergei Skripal poisoning in the U.K. and sabotage operations in Europe. Russia reportedly paid the Taliban at least $30 million altogether for attacks on coalition soldiers. GRU contracted the killings to ramp up pressure against Western countries and force their retreat from the country, The Insider and Der Spiegel wrote. The attacks stopped after then-U.S. President Donald Trump struck a deal in early 2020 to withdraw from Afghanistan. The investigation also said that both the former Afghan administration and the U.S. were aware of the bounty program. The National Directorate of Security, Afghanistan&apos;s security agency before the Taliban takeover in 2021, learned about the scheme during interrogations of Taliban militants in mid-2019, the investigation said. Trump was broadly criticized at the time for inaction in the face of intelligence leaks pointing to Russian bounties on U.S. soldiers. The former president, who is returning to the White House on Jan. 20 for his second term, acknowledged he had never approached Russian President Vladimir Putin about the reports. Trump has often voiced his sympathies for the Russian leader and said he trusts him more than U.S. intelligence on several occasions. Joe Biden, who was then running for president, criticized Trump at the time, but his administration later downplayed the reports. Biden finalized the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, which was followed by a quick collapse of the Afghan administration and the Taliban&apos;s takeover. The Insider and Der Spiegel also reported that Russia&apos;s operations in Afghanistan went beyond the bounty program. Moscow was attempting to undermine the U.S.-led coalition with the help of the Taliban and Iran since the start of the intervention in 2001, the investigation claimed.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-paid-afghan-militants-200-000-per-killed-us-coalition-soldier-media-investigation-says/	2025-01-09T05:48:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Afghanistan.jpg
Denmark, Norway to buy $183 million in arms for Kyiv from Ukrainian manufacturers in 2025	Denmark and Norway are expected to spend 178 million euros ($183 million) on arms purchases from Ukrainian manufacturers in 2025, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry said on Jan. 9. Denmark has reserved 135 million euros ($139 million) for further purchases under the &quot;Danish model,&quot; buying arms for Ukraine directly from Ukrainian arms manufacturers. Norway is expected to contribute another 43 million euros ($44 million) to this initiative. The Ukrainian Armed Forces have already received weapons worth almost 538 million euros ($554 million) through direct purchases from Ukraine&apos;s defense industry, according to the ministry. The sources of funding were 390 million euros ($402 million) in proceeds from frozen Russian assets, 125 million euros ($129 million) from the Danish government through the Danish National Ukraine Fund, 20 million euros ($21 million) from Sweden, and another 2.7 million euros ($2.8 million) from Iceland. At the end of September 2024, Denmark announced it would invest 4.2 billion Danish kroner ($630 million) in the Ukrainian defense industry. Denmark is the first country with which Ukraine has started joint weapons production, as President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Danish funds were used to purchase domestically made arms, such as the Bohdana self-propelled artillery systems capable of firing 155 mm NATO-standard shells. Lithuania has also adopted the Danish model for Ukraine. It will invest 10 million euros ($10.3 million) in producing the Ukrainian long-range drone-missile Palianytsia.	https://kyivindependent.com/denmark-norway-expected-to-purchase-weapons-worth-183-million-from-ukrainian-manufacturers-in-2025/	2025-01-09T05:35:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-18-at-16_48_24.png
Ukraine's 47th Brigade releases video of 'massive' Russian attack repelled in Kursk Oblast	Ukraine&apos;s 47th Mechanized Brigade said on Jan. 9 that it had, together with other units, repelled a &quot;massive&quot; Russian assault in the embattled Kursk Oblast, releasing footage of the engagement. The report came days after Ukraine reportedly launched renewed offensive operations in Kursk Oblast, which is seen as a crucial bargaining chip for potential peace negotiations. Almost 50 Russian ground assaults were repelled in Kursk Oblast over the past day, the General Staff said. The Russian attack reportedly involved about 50 vehicles, including tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, and buggies. According to the brigade, Russian troops initially tried to demine the approaches to Ukrainian positions and attacked in six waves. Russia deployed &quot;a huge number of soldiers,&quot; with Ukrainian forces killing 45 troops and injuring 53, the military claimed. 0:00/1&#xD7;The footage shared on Jan. 9, 2025, purporting to show Ukrainian forces repelling a Russian attack in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast (Ukraine&apos;s 47th Mechanized Brigade/Telegram)&quot;Tanks, BMP-2, BMD, APCs (armored personnel carriers), buggies and Lancets &#x2014; our soldiers and comrades burned Russian equipment worth tens of millions of dollars,&quot; the brigade said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. No further details on the attack were disclosed. The Russian military has not commented on Ukraine&apos;s claim. Ukrainian forces launched a large-scale operation in Kursk Oblast in early August, allegedly capturing up to 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian soil. Since then, Russia has deployed reinforcements &#x2014; including North Korean soldiers &#x2014; in the area and reportedly retook around half of the lost territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-47th-brigade-releases-video-of-massive-russian-attack-being-repelled-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-01-09T04:48:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/--------------2025-01-09-142759.png
Zelensky to meet with Italian PM, president in Italy after Ramstein summit, media reports	President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Italian President Sergio Mattarella in Italy on Jan. 9, Suspilne reported, citing its undisclosed source. Zelensky is attending the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting, also known as Ramstein format, on Jan. 9. The president will travel to Italy following the summit, which will be the last gathering in this format before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Zelensky was also scheduled to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden in Italy, but the U.S. leader canceled the trip due to the wildfires in California, according to Suspilne. Zelensky previously announced a series of meetings with international partners to discuss further support for Ukraine in the war against Russia. Speaking at the Ramstein format meeting, Zelensky urged the allies not to relent in helping Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. &quot;We&apos;ve come such a long way that it would honestly be crazy to drop the ball now and not keep building on the defense coalitions we&apos;ve created,&quot; he said. During the meeting, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also announced a $500 million aid package for Ukraine, including air defense missiles, ammunition, and equipment for F-16 fighter jets.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-meet-with-italian-pm-president-in-italy-after-ramstein-summit-suspilne-reports/	2025-01-09T04:33:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Zelensky-and-Meloni-1.jpeg
Russian forces 2 km from Kupiansk's outskirts, official says	The key northeastern Ukrainian town of Kupiansk now lies only 2 kilometers (1.5 miles) from the front line as Russian troops sustain their attacks, Andrii Besedin, head of the Kupiansk town military administration, said on national television on Jan. 9. Russian troops ramped up their efforts near Kupiansk last September and approached its industrial outskirts in the northeast. Ukrainian forces repelled several Russian attempts at entering the town throughout December. &quot;The situation is very difficult; the front line is 2 kilometers from the town&apos;s outskirts. Russia is constantly attempting to attack,&quot; Besedin said. The Russian army also conducted 12 attacks on Jan. 8 in the direction of the settlements of Holubivka and Petropavlika, located nearly 6 kilometers (3 miles) from Kupiansk, according to Besedin. The estimated Russian advance near Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 8, 2025, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Russian troops are trying to reach the main Svatove-Kupiansk highway to enter the eastern part of the town, Besedin added. &quot;The situation is very difficult and threatens the Kupiansk and Vovchansk sectors (of the front line). Russia is trying to gain a foothold in the town of Dvorichna, on the western bank of the Oskil (River). If they manage to transfer equipment to the western bank, there will be a threat of a rear attack in the Vovchansk sector and Kupiansk,&quot; he said. Besedin added that residents of the Kupiansk community, despite the poor infrastructure, are not in a hurry to evacuate. On average, only five people leave the community&apos;s 12 settlements per day. Some 900 people, primarily elderly, remain in the eastern part of the community and firmly refuse to be evacuated, according to the local military administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-near-kupiansk/	2025-01-09T03:55:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178114559-1.jpg
Biden administration unveils its final $500 million aid package for Ukraine	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced on Jan. 9 a $500 million aid package for Ukraine, including air defense missiles, ammunition, and equipment for F-16 fighter jets. The package was unveiled at the Ramstein summit in Germany. It is expected to be the final U.S. defense tranche provided by the Biden administration before Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Trump&apos;s imminent return to the White House has caused concern about the future of U.S. support for Ukraine, as the president-elect has often criticized the Biden administration&apos;s assistance provided to Kyiv. The incoming U.S. leadership changes have also cast doubt on the future of the Ramstein-format Ukraine Defense Contact Group, a coalition of 57 countries that has been coordinating aid for Ukraine since April 2022. &quot;Month after month, members of this Contact Group have helped provide, produce, and sustain the systems and the munitions that Ukraine needs,&quot; Austin said in his address to the meeting alongside President Volodymyr Zelensky and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. &quot;So we must not let up. That&apos;s why I am announcing today another presidential drawdown authority package valued at approximately $500 million. &quot;It includes additional missiles for Ukrainian air defense, more ammunition, and more air-to-ground munitions and other equipment to support Ukraine&apos;s F-16s.&quot; Around $3.8 billion remains allocated for Ukraine under the presidential drawdown authority, which enables Washington to provide arms and equipment to Kyiv directly from the Pentagon&apos;s stocks. The future of these funds under the incoming Trump administration is uncertain. Speaking at the meeting, Austin highlighted the Ramstein group&apos;s progress over more than two and half years of its existence, including eight &quot;capability coalitions&quot; led by 14 countries. &quot;Earlier today, the Coalition Leadership Group met again, including representatives from those 15 countries. And they endorsed Capability Coalition roadmaps leading to the year 2027,&quot; Austin said.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-administration-unveils-its-final-500-million-aid-package-for-ukraine/	2025-01-09T03:41:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2181251042.jpg
It would be crazy to drop the ball now' — Zelensky urges continued unity, support for Ukraine at Ramstein	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived at the Ramstein airbase in Germany on Jan. 9, delivering an opening address to the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting. Zelensky is expected to hold a series of bilateral meetings during the summit, which will be the last gathering in this format before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. &quot;It&apos;s clear that a new chapter starts for Europe and the entire world just 11 days from now, when we have to cooperate even more, rely on each other even more, and achieve greater results together,&quot; Zelensky said in his opening address alongside outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Trump&apos;s return to the White House has caused concern about the future of U.S. support for Ukraine, as the president-elect has often criticized the Biden administration&apos;s assistance provided to Kyiv. The U.S. is expected to unveil a $500 million aid package for Ukraine at the meeting, the last military aid tranche provided by the Biden administration. Around $3.8 billion remains allocated under the presidential drawdown authority (PDA), leaving it uncertain whether Trump will continue using this tool to funnel arms to Ukraine. Speaking at the meeting, Zelensky urged the allies not to relent in helping Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. &quot;We&apos;ve come such a long way that it would honestly be crazy to drop the ball now and not keep building on the defense coalitions we&apos;ve created,&quot; the president noted. The UDCG comprises 57 countries, including all 32 NATO members, and was formed in April 2022 to coordinate international support for Ukraine. Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz implied earlier this week that the Jan. 9 meeting might be the last one in the current format.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-joins-ramstein-summit-in-germany/	2025-01-09T03:03:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187689001.jpg
Russian airstrike against Kherson injures 6, damages kindergarten	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. Russian forces dropped guided aerial bombs on the city of Kherson on Jan. 9, injuring at least six people, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. One bomb reportedly hit a house, destroying it.

Military deserter, his wife detained in Dnipro terror attack case	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and the police detained a married couple suspected of producing an explosive used in a Dnipro terrorist attack last December on Russia&apos;s behalf, the SBU said on Jan. 9. One person was killed and four injured, including two police officers, in an explosion in the central-eastern city of Dnipro on Dec. 14, 2024, near a military enlistment office. The newly detained suspects, a 33-year-old soldier who went AWOL (absent without leave) and his 25-year-old wife, were looking for &quot;easy money&quot; and were recruited via the Telegram messenger by Russian intelligence services, the SBU said. They are believed to have acted separately from the suspected perpetrator of the attack, a 37-year-old resident who was detained within hours of the explosion and has also been accused of acting on Russia&apos;s behalf. The married couple made the improvised explosive device based on Russian intelligence&apos;s instructions and stashed them in a hiding place. Subsequently, they watched the terrorist attack being carried out and went into hiding, the SBU said. Law enforcement officers detained the suspects at their new addresses and seized mobile phones and clothes containing evidence of their acts. The two have been charged with terrorism and face life in prison. Russia has been accused of plotting numerous terrorist attacks in Ukraine in an effort to sow panic and undermine the country&apos;s resistance amid the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/2-more-suspects-detained-in-dnipro-terror-attack-case/	2025-01-09T02:35:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-09_10-00-12.jpg
Russian propagandist, Crimean Bridge film director Keosayan in coma after suffering clinical death	Russian propagandist and film director Tigran Keosayan has suffered a clinical death and is in a coma, his wife and Russia Today editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan said on her Telegram channel on Jan. 8. Keosayan, 59, was hospitalized in late December. His condition is serious, according to Russian media outlet Baza. The Russian propagandist previously suffered a heart attack in 2008 and 2010 and underwent aortocoronary stenting. &quot;I didn&apos;t want to until the last minute, but since reporters have already started calling, I&apos;ll write it myself. My husband, Tigran Keosayan, has suffered a clinical death and is in a coma. As many people know, he has had a very sick heart for a long time,&quot; Simonyan said. Keosayan hosted the International Pilorama program on the Russian state-controlled NTV channel. His directorial career began in 1992. Since then, he has directed about 20 films, including the propaganda film &quot;The Crimean Bridge. Made with Love!&quot; The film takes place during the construction of the Crimean Bridge, which Russia built to link the Russian-occupied peninsula with the Russian mainland. The structure became a critical supply route for Russian forces after the launch of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In March 2020, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny released a video where he alleged serious corruption violations during the film&apos;s production. According to Navalny, at least 46 million rubles (nearly $ 449,000) of state funds intended for the film were diverted to Simonyan&apos;s relatives. Following the outbreak of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Keosayan was subject to sanctions by the European Union, the U.K., Canada, and other countries. In October 2022, he was added to Ukraine&apos;s sanctions list for spreading anti-Ukrainian propaganda.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-propagandist-in-coma-clinical-death/	2025-01-09T02:18:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1052453150.jpg
Armenia's government backs bill on launching EU accession process	The Armenian government on Jan. 9 supported a draft law on initiating the country&apos;s accession process with the European Union, Armenia News reported. The government &quot;expressed a positive stance&quot; on the bill, which was submitted as a citizens&apos; initiative. It has been submitted to Armenia&apos;s parliament for consideration, Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan said. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan stressed that even if the bill is passed, the accession process can start only if the Armenian people support it in a referendum. &quot;But if the law is adopted, we must have some idea about our next steps&quot; and &quot;discuss with the EU the road map that they imagine and that we imagine,&quot; Pashinyan said at a government meeting. The prime minister noted that the bill should be approached without &quot;undue enthusiasm&quot; and that the country should currently focus on developing more practical steps, such as visa liberalization. Speaking in the European Parliament in October 2023, Pashinyan said that his country is ready to align more closely with the bloc, though he later expressed doubts about whether Armenia is ready for full membership. Pashinyan spoke in the EU&apos;s legislature shortly after Russia, Armenia&apos;s traditional ally, failed to prevent an Azerbaijani lighting offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh, leading to a rapid deterioration of ties between Yerevan and Moscow. Last March, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging the EU&apos;s executive bodies to strengthen relations with Armenia. The parliament also said Armenia meets the Maastricht Treaty requirements to apply for membership.	https://kyivindependent.com/armenias-government-backs-bill-on-launching-eu-accession-process/	2025-01-09T01:44:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2133933919.jpg
Ex-FBI informant accused of lying about Biden family's ties to Ukrainian business jailed for 6 years	A Californian court sentenced former FBI informant Alexander Smirnov, who falsely accused the Biden family of taking a bribe from a Ukrainian business, to six years in prison, CNN reported on Jan. 8. Smirnov is accused of tax evasion and making false statements that U.S. President Joe Biden and his son Hunter each received $5 million from Ukrainian energy company Burisma. Smirnov was also obliged to pay about $675,000 in reimbursement to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to compensate for tax evasion, according to CNN. During the 2020 investigation, Smirnov alleged that members of Burisma&apos;s management team told him in 2015 and 2016 that they hired Biden&apos;s son to defend the company against legal issues in the U.S. and gave them a $10 million bribe. Biden was then the U.S. vice president under President Barack Obama. Hunter Biden served on Burisma&apos;s board of directors from 2014-2019. The FBI examined the case and, after a few months, recommended closing it, but the Republicans in Congress initiated a parliamentary investigation in 2023 in the hope of impeaching Biden. Special prosecutor David Weiss, who led the investigation, said Smirnov had slandered Biden, citing personal animosity. Born in the Soviet Union, Smirnov emigrated to Israel with his family as a child and later moved to the U.S. He became a naturalized citizen and an informant for the FBI. According to prosecutors, he later began to express bias against Biden and invented a narrative about bribery in Ukraine to harm Biden&apos;s campaign against Donald Trump in 2020. According to the court, Smirnov also had ties to Russian intelligence services. He was arrested in Nevada in February 2024 when he returned to the U.S. from abroad. Smirnov faced a maximum sentence of 35 years in prison, but under the terms of the agreement, he was due four to six years and a fine. Smirnov&apos;s defense insisted on four years, noting that the man &quot;suffers from serious eye-related health problems&quot; and a lengthy sentence would &quot;unreasonably prolong his suffering.&quot; Weiss indicted Hunter Biden on tax and arms trafficking charges. In 2024, a jury found him guilty of three gun-related crimes, and he later pleaded guilty to nine federal tax offenses. Outgoing President Biden unconditionally pardoned his son in December before the verdict in both cases.	https://kyivindependent.com/ex-fbi-informant-sentenced/	2025-01-09T00:58:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2187280340.jpg
Russian tanker fuel spill could reach Ukraine's coast, Navy warns	The fuel spilled into the Black Sea by two Russian tankers last month could reach Ukraine&apos;s southern coast in the Mykolaiv and Odesa oblasts, Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk said on air on Jan. 9. Volgoneft 212 and Volgoneft 239 suffered severe damage in the Kerch Strait during a storm on Dec. 15, 2024. Each vessel reportedly carried 4,000 tons of fuel, which began leaking into the Black Sea. &quot;The current direction indicates that, most likely, the oil fuel can reach our Odesa and Mykolaiv oblasts&apos; coasts,&quot; Pletenchuk said on national television. Greenpeace Ukraine warned the spill may cause &quot;significant&quot; environmental damage and foul the shoreline if the fuel is driven ashore. The spokesperson noted that Russian civilian vessels continue to sail through the Kerch Strait since &quot;without oil exports and subsequent profits, it will be even more difficult for them to wage this war.&quot; Days after the spill, the oil fuel washed ashore in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai and the Russian-occupied Crimea. Krasnodar Krai residents shared footage of birds injured by the spill and unable to fly. Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine has caused massive environmental damage, including the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka Dam and subsequent flooding, widespread forest fires, and the devastation of wide stretches of farmland. In October 2024, the Kyiv School of Economics Institute warned that Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of old and poorly insured tankers poses significant environmental risks, as these often uninsured and aging vessels increase the danger of oil spills.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-tanker-oil-spill-could-reach-ukraines-coast-navy-warns/	2025-01-09T00:41:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2149505233.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 19, injure 132 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least 19 civilians and injured at least 132 over the past day, regional authorities said on Jan. 9, with most of the casualties reported following an airstrike on Zaporizhzhia. Russia launched 70 Shahed-type attack drones and various dummy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Forty-six drones were shot down over nine regions, while 24 dummy drones were lost in the airspace, according to the statement. A Russian airstrike against an industrial facility in the city of Zaporizhzhia on Jan. &#xA0;8 killed at least 13 people and injured at least 113, the State Emergency Service said the following day. Fifty-nine people have been hospitalized, of whom 10 are in serious condition. Elsewhere in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, two people were killed and two injured in a Russian attack against the village of Stepnohirsk, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. In Kharkiv Oblast, two women aged 42 and 67 were injured on the evening of Jan. 8 after a Russian drone attack against the village of Nove Pekelne, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. The victims did not require hospitalization. Four people were killed and 10 injured in Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast over the past day, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. Two high-rise buildings, four houses, agricultural machinery, and cars were damaged. Five civilians were injured in Russian strikes in Sumy Oblast on Jan. 8, including three in the Seredyna-Buda community and two in the Yunakiv community, the regional military administration reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-118/	2025-01-08T23:27:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-08_16-34-43.jpg
White House calls halt of Russian gas transit via Ukraine one of Moscow's 'most costly defeats'	The shutdown of Russian gas transit through Ukrainian territory is one of Moscow&apos;s &quot;most costly defeats,&quot; U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said, as reported by Ukrinform on Jan. 8. Ukraine terminated Russian natural gas transit through its territory on Jan. 1. Kyiv has repeatedly warned that it would not extend the agreement when it expires at the end of 2024 because it did not want to finance Russia&apos;s war. Ukraine&apos;s move will deprive Russia of about $6.5 billion in annual revenue from gas sales to Europe, according to Kirby. The spokesperson added that the U.S. also tries to make Russia suffer losses through sanctions and export restrictions. Meanwhile, Washington is trying to increase energy supplies to Europe, particularly liquefied natural gas (LNG). According to Kirby, currently, 50% of European LNG imports come from the U.S. The spokesperson mentioned that 25 years ago, when Russian President Vladimir Putin took office, more than 130 billion cubic meters of gas were transported to Europe through Ukraine, and today this figure is zero. Following Ukraine&apos;s termination of Russian gas transportation through its territory, gas prices in Europe rose by 4.3% to almost 51 euros per megawatt-hour. This rise is the highest since October 2023 and comes ahead of freezing temperatures forecast across much of Europe. The halt also coincided with a major gas outage in Moldova&apos;s Russian-occupied Transnistria region, which relied on transit through Ukraine, according to its gas supplier Tiraspoltransgaz-Pridnestrovie. Russia&apos;s state-owned energy giant Gazprom claimed that the halt of gas supplies to Moldova was caused by alleged unpaid debt by Chisinau rather than transit issues.	https://kyivindependent.com/kirby-calls-termination-of-russian-gas-transit-via-ukraine-one-of-moscows-most-costly-defeats/	2025-01-08T23:17:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/gettyimages-1249025066-1679492490evazd.jpeg
Transnistria has less than month of gas left, local authorities say	Gas storage in Moldova&apos;s Russian-occupied region of Transnistria will last another 24 days after the halt of Russian supplies, local authorities said on Jan. 8. Transnistria faces a major crisis after Russia&apos;s state-owned Gazprom company halted gas supplies to Moldova, citing alleged unpaid debt. While the government-held part of the country relies on EU energy supplies, the Transnistrian region, occupied by Russia since the 1990s, is still heavily dependent on Russia. Sergei Obolonik, the deputy head of the region&apos;s executive branch, said that Transnistria faces not only an energy crisis but also a humanitarian one. &quot;The gas reserve of 13 million cubic meters enables us to supply several social institutions and other facilities crucial for the functioning of the society, as well as multi-residential buildings for cooking,&quot; the authorities said in a statement on a website. The administration previously urged residents to use wood and stoves for heating to reduce gas consumption. The region also faces electricity deficits amid a surge in the use of electronic heaters and gas shortages in power stations. The Dniester State District Power Plant, the region&apos;s largest power station, has switched to coal, though the authorities warned of possible risks of operating at full capacity due to the plant&apos;s obsolete equipment. Nearly 72,000 homes and 1,500 high-rise buildings in Transnistria are without heating or hot water, according to Vadim Krasnoselsky, leader of the region&#x2019;s Russian-backed administration. Moldova previously offered to help Transnistria purchase gas through European platforms, but local Russian-backed authorities rejected the proposal, claiming Western energy prices are &quot;higher and unstable.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/transnistria-has-less-than-month-of-gas-left/	2025-01-08T22:49:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1411857866.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 803,100 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 803,100 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 9. This number includes 1,430 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,731 tanks, 20,221 armored fighting vehicles, 33,387 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,765 artillery systems, 1,260 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,038 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 21,813 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-803-100-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-08T22:15:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2166170923-1.jpg
Lithuania tightens security ahead of decoupling from Russian energy grid, Euronews reports	Lithuania has announced plans to enhance security measures around its power grids with Poland in preparation for next month&apos;s decoupling from the Russian energy system. The move marks a significant step in disconnecting from the Soviet-era grid shared with Russia and Belarus. Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas said that the government had directed police forces to safeguard the electricity link with Warsaw, known as the LitPol Link. This decision comes amid concerns about potential sabotage following recent incidents in the Baltic Sea. &quot;We evaluate every possible version of sabotage, from cybersecurity to physical actions. Therefore, we deploy the Public Security Service because it has the most experience in protecting critical objects. They will replace private security services that have been protecting these objects,&quot; Paluckas said during a press conference on Jan. 8, according to Euronews. Last month, Lithuania&apos;s previous government increased security around the LitPol converter and transformer station near Alytus in southern Lithuania. A private security firm was initially contracted to protect the facility until spring, after which the Public Security Service will take over. Giedrimas Jeglinskas, Chairman of the Parliament&#x2019;s Committee on National Security and Defence, highlighted the risks in the Baltic Sea, where infrastructure damage and sabotage attempts have reportedly increased. &quot;Either it&#x2019;s intentional or unintentional, the number of these incidents will increase. The Baltic Sea is very peculiar, it&#x2019;s relatively shallow and cables are not that deep. Therefore, these incidents will repeat, because Russia is using the shadow fleet,&quot; Jeglinskas reportedly said. According to the office of the Lithuanian Prime Minister, there are &quot;clear and unambiguous attempts by opponents to disrupt&quot; the planned decoupling, though no further details were provided on the alleged threats or those responsible. Officials assured the public that Lithuania&#x2019;s energy reserves and contingency plans would prevent any power shortages. &quot;There is no scenario in which Lithuania would be left without electricity. We&apos;ve evaluated all scenarios, including operating without any interconnections. Those reserves have been assessed, and scenarios A, B, C, D and so on have been worked out. Perhaps the most important message that we want to communicate is the following: Despite any provocations that could occur, any incidents, the disconnection from BRELL [Belarus, Russia, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania] &#x2013; the Russian electricity grid &#x2013; is inevitable and will happen in exactly one month,&quot; said Arnoldas Pikzirnis, Lithuanian Vice Energy Minister. The Baltic states plan to disconnect from the Russian energy grid on Feb. 8. Following the decoupling, they aim to independently operate their national grids, which have undergone significant upgrades supported by 1.6 billion euros in European funding.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-tightens-security-ahead-of-decoupling-from-russian-energy-grid-euronews-reports/	2025-01-08T21:55:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1437356897.jpg
North Korea gains combat experience fighting in Ukraine, boosting regional threat, US warns	North Korea is gaining valuable combat experience from its troops fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, enhancing its ability to wage war against neighboring countries, a senior U.S. official said on Jan. 8. Since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has strengthened both diplomatic and military ties with Pyongyang. According to Dorothy Camille Shea, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the U.N., over 12,000 North Korean soldiers are currently in Russia and began engaging Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region last month. North Korea &quot;is significantly benefiting from receiving Russian military equipment, technology, and experience, rendering it more capable of waging war against its neighbors,&quot; Shea said during a U.N. Security Council meeting. The council convened to discuss Pyongyang&#x2019;s recent test of an intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile. &quot;In turn, the DPRK will likely be eager to leverage these improvements to promote weapons sales and military training contracts globally.&quot; North Korea&#x2019;s UN ambassador, Kim Song, defended Monday&apos;s missile test, describing it as part of efforts to strengthen the country&apos;s defense. He accused the United States of hypocrisy: &quot;When the civilian death toll exceeded 45,000 in Gaza, United States embellished Israel&#x2019;s nefarious mass killing atrocity as the right to self-defense&#x2026; Meanwhile, it takes issue with the legitimate exercise of the right to self-defense of the DPRK.&quot; Russia&apos;s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, repeated longstanding claims that the U.S., South Korea, and Japan provoke North Korea through military drills. He dismissed U.S. allegations of plans to share satellite and space technology with Pyongyang as &quot;wholly unsubstantiated.&quot; South Korea&#x2019;s UN ambassador, Joonkook Hwang, condemned North Korea&#x2019;s deployment of soldiers to Russia, describing them as &quot;essentially slaves to Kim Jong-un, brainwashed to sacrifice their lives on faraway battlefields to raise money for his regime and secure advanced military technology from Russia.&quot; North Korea has faced U.N. sanctions since 2006, aimed at halting its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. However, with Russia holding veto power in the Security Council, any additional measures are unlikely to advance.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-gains-combat-experience-fighting-in-ukraine-boosting-regional-threat-us-warns/	2025-01-08T20:12:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1074306244.jpg
NATO membership is Ukraine’s best security guarantee, Finland's FM tells Reuters	NATO membership is the only credible long-term guarantee Ukraine can secure to defend against future Russian aggression, Finland&apos;s Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen told Reuters on Jan. 8. While Donald Trump&apos;s upcoming return to the White House on January 20 has sparked hope for a diplomatic resolution to Moscow&apos;s invasion, it has also raised concerns in Kyiv about a potential peace deal coming with steep concessions. President Volodymyr Zelensky has emphasized the need for robust security assurances from allies to prevent Russia from regrouping for another attack. &quot;In the long term, the only credible security guarantee is Article 5 of the Washington Treaty&#x2014;so NATO membership essentially,&quot; Valtonen said in an interview with Reuters during her visit to Kyiv, referencing the alliance&apos;s collective defense clause. &quot;And we are supporting Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership further down the line and hopefully not in (the) too-distant future.&quot; Ukraine has strongly advocated for an invitation to join NATO, but resistance from key member states persists as the all-out war nears its three-year mark, with Ukrainian forces continuing to face challenges in pushing back Russian offensives. Trump, who has expressed skepticism about U.S. aid to Ukraine, said on Jan. 7 that he sympathizes with Russia&apos;s stance against Ukraine joining NATO. His aides and allies view Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership as a potential provocation toward Moscow. He also accused outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden of altering the U.S. position on Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO prospects. Despite these developments, Valtonen suggested that a Trump administration would not necessarily derail Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations. &quot;Three years ago nobody thought that Finland would be joining NATO, or Sweden for that matter,&quot; she remarked. &quot;So here we are, you never know.&quot; Finland, which shares an 830-mile (1,336 km) border with Russia, joined NATO in 2023 following Moscow&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Sweden became a member in early 2024. On the topic of defense spending, Trump also called for European NATO members to increase their defense budgets from 2% of GDP to 5%. Valtonen noted that Finland has been proactive in meeting its defense commitments and welcomed Trump&#x2019;s push for greater European contributions. &quot;We are very much on the same page with Trump on that, because I think we should do more, we can do more,&quot; she said. &quot;Certainly Europe has improved massively over the course of the past years, and will continue doing so.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-membership-is-ukraines-best-security-guarantee-finlands-fm-tells-reuters/	2025-01-08T18:39:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1250760048.jpg
Russia doesn't have as many advantages as it seems, US defense secretary says	Russia does not hold all the advantages in the full-scale war against Ukraine, outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in an interview with Bloomberg News on Jan. 8. Austin&apos;s comments come on the eve of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The Jan. 9 meeting will be the last Ramstein summit before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office. &quot;There&apos;s a thought that Russia has the ultimate hand here and it has every advantage,&quot; Austin told Bloomberg News. &quot;It has some advantages, but it doesn&apos;t completely dominate this equation here. And if it gets what it wants, it will cost them in the future.&quot; Austin said that Ukraine&apos;s strengths and Russia&apos;s challenges should affect potential peace negotiations, which Trump has promised to initiate after his inauguration. The push for a quick end to the war has led to fears that Kyiv will be pressured into unfavorable concessions, including loss of land. Russia currently occupies around 20% of Ukrainian territory. President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged that Ukraine&apos;s military cannot currently retake all of it by force and has said that some regions, including Crimea, will have to be liberated through diplomatic means. Even if Russia gains territory in a negotiated agreement, Austin said, continuing to occupy Ukrainian regions will drain Moscow&apos;s resources. &quot;Russia will have to invest a lot of land forces to hold it,&quot; he said. Austin also noted Russia&apos;s dependence on Iran and North Korea for assistance, including &quot;weapons and munitions and also now people.&quot; Up to 12,000 North Korean soldiers have been dispatched to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, to fight alongside Russian troops against Ukrainian forces. The outgoing U.S. administration has said that it aims to bolster Ukraine&apos;s position in upcoming negotiations with an influx of military aid and efforts to shore up its international alliances. The UDCG summit on Jan. 9 will focus on supporting Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities through the year 2027, according to the Pentagon. The UDCG consists of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the Ramstein Air Base on a regular basis to coordinate military support for Ukraine. Trump has not yet outlined his plans for the contact group, and some believe the next meeting may be its last. &#xA0; Ahead of his final Ramstein summit, Austin defended U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s strategy on Ukraine. &quot;What it did was it helped Ukraine survive, it helped Ukraine defend its sovereign territory,&quot; Austin said. &quot;The loss of 700,000 troops killed and wounded &#x2014; that would&apos;ve been beyond imagination three years ago,&quot; he said, referring to the heavy losses Russia has sustained over the course of the full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-doesnt-have-as-many-advantages-as-it-seems-us-defense-secretary-says/	2025-01-08T16:01:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-2096837949.jpg
Ukraine to help Moldova amid worsening energy crisis	Kyiv and Chisinau are working together to find solutions to the ongoing energy crisis in Moldova, President Volodymyr Zelensky and Moldovan President Maia Sandu announced on Jan. 8. The Russian state energy company Gazprom cut off gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1, triggering widespread power outages and heating failures in the Russian-occupied Transnistria region. Zelensky and Sandu held a telephone conversation on Jan. 8 in which they discussed the energy crisis and Russia&apos;s role. &quot;An important task now is to help Moldova overcome its energy challenges and prevent Moscow from stirring up social tensions. ... We are ready to help,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address. Zelensky said the current crisis represents &quot;an obvious attempt by Russia to manipulate energy resources against the Moldovan authorities.&quot; According to Sandu&apos;s press service, the two leaders are collaborating on &quot;common solutions&quot; to prevent the emergency from devolving further, including using alternative fuel sources, such as coal. The Moldovan government has accused Moscow of deliberately manufacturing the crisis in order to destabilize the country. Gazprom claims the decision to cut off gas supplies resulted from Moldova&apos;s unpaid debts, an allegation Chisinau disputes. An agreement to transit Russian gas to Europe through Ukraine expired on the same day that Russia ended gas deliveries to Moldova, but Gazprom maintains that the suspension was prompted by debts, not transit issues. Alternative routes for gas from Russia to Moldova are available. While the rest of Moldova has transitioned to European energy supplies, the breakaway Transnistria region &#x2014;&#xA0;occupied by Russian troops since the 1990s &#x2014; remains heavily dependent on Russian gas. The region&apos;s electricity system is now on the brink of collapse.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-help-moldova-amid-worsening-energy-crisis/	2025-01-08T14:02:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/zelensky.jpeg
Trump wants to end war in 100 days, incoming peace envoy tells Fox News	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump aims to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine within 100 days of his inauguration, Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s choice for special Ukraine peace envoy, told Fox News on Jan. 8. The comments come a day after Trump said in a press conference that he would not launch peace talks until after his inauguration. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, pledged repeatedly during his campaign to negotiate an end to the war as soon as he was elected. &quot;This is a war that needs to end, and I think he can do it in the near term,&quot; Kellogg said in an interview with Fox News. Kellogg defined the &quot;near term&quot; as 100 days out from inauguration, and said it was his personal and professional goal to help Trump broker a solution by that point. &quot;People need to understand, he&apos;s not trying to give something to Putin or to the Russians, he&apos;s actually trying to save Ukraine and save their sovereignty,&quot; Kellogg said. &quot;And he&apos;s going to make sure that it&apos;s equitable and it&apos;s fair.&quot; Kellogg praised Trump for his willingness to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and said U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s refusal to work with Putin was his &quot;biggest mistake.&quot; He said Trump would work to find a resolution satisfactory to both Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky. &quot;I think they&apos;re going to come to a solvable solution in the near term. ... Let&apos;s set it at 100 days,&quot; he said. Kellogg did not discuss details of any potential peace agreements under consideration by the incoming administration. Kellogg, 80, previously held key roles as executive secretary and chief of staff of the U.S. National Security Council under President Trump, and served as a senior advisor to then-Vice President Mike Pence. He was planning a visit to Kyiv, which has reportedly been postponed until after Trump&apos;s inauguration. In a press conference on Jan. 7, Trump blamed Biden for provoking Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, saying U.S. support for Ukraine&apos;s aspirations to join NATO triggered the war. A report by The Wall Street Journal has previously suggested that Trump&apos;s team was exploring a plan to delay Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for Western arms supplies and European peacekeepers to monitor a potential ceasefire with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-wants-to-end-war-in-100-days-incoming-peace-envoy-tells-fox-news/	2025-01-08T13:14:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1242112038.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine strikes Russian oil depot, command post; Moscow bombs civilians in Zaporizhzhia	Key developments on Jan. 8: Ukrainian forces attacked a Russian oil depot in Engels, Saratov Oblast, overnight on Jan. 8, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said after reports of drone attacks. The operation, carried out jointly by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence, the Unmanned Systems Forces, and other units, targeted the Kristal Plant used to supply fuel to the nearby Engels-2 airbase, the military said. The statement comes shortly after Russian authorities reported a drone attack in the area, with footage of the burning oil facility circulating on social media. The city of Engels lies around 600 kilometers (370 miles) from the front lines in Ukraine. Saratov Oblast Governor Roman Busargin said Ukrainian drone debris struck an unspecified &quot;industrial facility&quot; around 5:30 a.m. local time amid a &quot;massive&quot; drone attack on the city. No information was immediately available as to the extent of the damage caused. Busargin said that there were no injuries as a result of the attack. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed that 11 Ukrainian attack drones were downed over Saratov Oblast. &quot;The depot&apos;s destruction creates significant logistical problems for Russian strategic aviation and reduces its ability to attack peaceful Ukrainian cities and civilian facilities,&quot; the General Staff said. The Engels-2 base hosts the 121st Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment, operating Tu-160 bombers, and the 184th Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment with the Tupolev Tu-95 MS planes. Russia uses these aircraft to launch mass strikes on Ukraine, often resulting in heavy damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties. Ukrainian forces have previously launched drone strikes targeting the airbase itself. Ukrainian forces carried out a precision strike against a command post of Russia&apos;s 8th Combined Arms Army in Russian-occupied Khartsyzk in Donetsk Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 8. The military said that Russia has seized the facility to coordinate attacks against Ukrainian forces and civilians, especially near Kurakhove. After weeks of heavy battles, Russia announced earlier this week it had fully captured Kurakhove. &quot;All necessary measures were taken to limit the risk to civilians,&quot; the General Staff noted. Khartsyzk lies around 25 kilometers (15 miles) east of the Russian-held Donetsk and has been occupied by Russia since the start of its war in 2014. The General Staff did not specify what weapon was used in the attack or the extent of the damage inflicted. Ukraine fields homemade missiles and long-range drones as well as Western-supplied arms like HIMARS, ATACMS, or Storm Shadow missiles. Similar attacks were reported in recent days, including a precision strike against a Russian command post in Kursk Oblast on Jan. 7 and another one in the same region on Jan. 2. Russian forces targeted an industrial facility in Zaporizhzhia on Jan. 8, killing 13 people and injuring 63, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. The attack was conducted using two FAB-500 gliding bombs, National Police reported. The attack damaged apartment buildings, an industrial facility, and other infrastructure. A tram and a minibus carrying passengers were also hit, as reported by the Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office. Aftermath of Russian attack on industrial facility in Zaporizhzhia on Jan. 8. (Governor Ivan Fedorov / Telegram)Zaporizhzhia, home to approximately 710,000 residents before Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, is frequently targeted by Russian forces. The attack is part of a broader wave of Russian assaults across Ukraine. Regional authorities reported at least two civilian deaths and 13 injuries nationwide over the past day. Overnight, Russia launched 64 Shahed-type attack drones and various dummy drones across Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian Air Force. Air defenses intercepted 41 drones over nine oblasts. Of the remaining drones, 22 dummy drones were lost in Ukrainian airspace, three returned to Russia, and one flew to Belarus. President Volodymyr Zelensky called for caution in interpreting U.S. policy following President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s comments linking Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO aspirations to Russia&#x2019;s invasion during a Jan. 8 meeting with Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen. The Ukrainian president argued that the absence of NATO membership and concrete security guarantees contributed to Russia&#x2019;s decision to launch the full-scale invasion. &quot;Putin realized no one would stand up for Ukraine. He thought he could destroy us, but the Ukrainian army proved him wrong,&quot; Zelensky said. Trump had criticized President Joe Biden for provoking Russia&#x2019;s invasion, claiming Ukraine&#x2019;s potential NATO membership had long been a significant concern for Moscow. &quot;That&#x2019;s been like written in stone. And Biden said, &#x2018;No, they should be able to join NATO.&#x2019; Then Russia has somebody right on their doorstep,&quot; Trump said. Zelensky dismissed conclusions about NATO, referencing Ukraine&#x2019;s recent access to Patriot missile systems and other NATO-standard weapons. &quot;Do you remember when Ukraine was told that Patriot systems are only available to NATO countries? Either we have been in NATO for a long time, or we should not jump to conclusions,&quot; he said. Finnish foreign minister emphasized that Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership poses no threat to other countries. &quot;This narrative is similar to the one Russia has long used, blaming NATO and its so-called &apos;enlargement&apos; for its own aggression,&quot; Valtonen said. Reports from The Wall Street Journal suggest Trump&#x2019;s team may propose delaying Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for Western arms supplies and European peacekeepers to monitor a potential ceasefire. While Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership remains a long-term goal, Zelensky reiterated the need for robust security guarantees in the immediate term. Ukrainian envoy Andrii Melnyk echoed this sentiment on Dec. 27, emphasizing that diplomatic efforts currently center on strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s defense capabilities rather than immediate NATO accession. Zelensky expressed cautious optimism about working with the incoming U.S. administration, reaffirming Ukraine&#x2019;s commitment to achieving a diplomatic resolution to the war by 2025. The final military aid package from the Biden administration to Ukraine, amounting to $500 million, is set to be officially announced on Jan. 9, Voice of America correspondent Carla Babb reported on Jan. 8 from Ramstein Air Base. The package, drawn from the Pentagon&#x2019;s existing stockpile under the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) program, is expected to be the last from the outgoing administration before President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on Jan. 20. Despite previous commitments to exhaust the remaining PDA funds, approximately $3.8 billion will remain unused, according to the Pentagon, leaving the funds at the disposal of the incoming administration. Trump and his team have been vocal critics of U.S. financial support for Ukraine. Michael Waltz, Trump&#x2019;s incoming National Security Advisor, said on Dec. 15 that &quot;a blank check... just isn&#x2019;t a strategy.&quot; In a Jan. 5 interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated Ukraine&#x2019;s willingness to work with the incoming U.S. administration. He proposed that Ukraine purchase U.S. weapons using $300 billion in frozen Russian assets. Despite previously criticizing U.S. aid for Ukraine, the Financial Times reported on Dec. 21, citing undisclosed sources, that Trump may not halt U.S. military support for Ukraine. While Zelensky remains committed to pursuing a diplomatic resolution by 2025, the incoming Trump administration&#x2019;s approach to the conflict and its impact on military aid remains unclear. General Mykhailo Drapatyi, Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces chief, reported to President Volodymyr Zelensky on the roots of the problems facing the French-trained 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Brigade and presented solutions, Drapatyi said on Jan. 8. The general&apos;s remarks followed a media investigation that claimed soldiers of the unit, currently deployed near Pokrovsk, have suffered losses and gone AWOL (absent without leave) in large numbers due to poor command and organization within Ukraine&#x2019;s military leadership. &quot;Most of the systemic shortcomings were committed by the Ground Forces Command, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and the Operational Command,&quot; the commander wrote on social media. Drapatyi was appointed to lead the Ground Forces last November, months after the brigade was formed. Without revealing all the details before &quot;all the circumstances are established,&quot; Drapatyi acknowledged &quot;inadequate management,&quot; &quot;mistakes in recruitment,&quot; and &quot;imperfect training planning&quot; within the unit. The commander said the biggest challenge was the &quot;low efficiency and motivation of mid-level commanders who directly manage people.&quot; Relevant solutions are already being implemented, with a focus on &quot;recruiting experienced officers and commanders at all levels,&quot; the general said, adding that the 155th Brigade&#x2019;s soldiers will receive additional training.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-strikes-russian-oil-depot-supplying-fuel-to-engels-2-airbase-command-post-in-donetsk-oblast/	2025-01-08T12:23:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GgwD6KeaUAAgJXL-1-1.png
Despite Trump's claims, Russia didn't invade Ukraine because of NATO	President-elect Donald Trump, on Jan. 7, blamed the outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden for Russia&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine. Trump said Biden&apos;s support of Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership had led to Russia&apos;s war against the country. &quot;I could understand their feelings,&quot; he said, referring to the country that launched the deadliest war in Europe since World War II. Trump&apos;s statements were far from reality, with Biden never officially supporting Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspiration and the White House being the main obstacle to Kyiv receiving a formal invite to join the alliance. &quot;It is possible that in two days, Trump will say something completely different, or Putin will make him angry because he will,&quot; Aaron Burnett, a senior fellow at the Democratic Strategy Initiative, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;(Trump&apos;s statements) is just a word salad.&quot; During the Jan. 7 press conference, President-elect Trump was explicit in his desire to seek territorial expansion, not ruling out using military force against Panama and NATO ally Denmark, and using economic mechanisms to conquer Canada. Trump also said he understands the desire for Russia&apos;s territorial expansion, blaming his country for Russia&apos;s war. &quot;A big part of the problem is, Russia &#x2014; for many, many years, long before (Vladimir) Putin &#x2014; said, &apos;You could never have NATO involved with Ukraine.&apos; Now, they&apos;ve said that. That&apos;s been, like, written in stone,&quot; Trump said. &quot;And somewhere along the line, Biden said, &apos;No. They should be able to join NATO.&apos; Well, then Russia has somebody right on their doorstep, and I could understand their feelings about that.&quot; Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014 when there were no talks about Ukraine joining NATO. The public opinion prior to Russia&apos;s invasion was also not in favor of joining the bloc. However, soon to be president, Trump, had long held unconventional views on NATO, its goals and the ways it works. U.S. President Donald Trump arrives to speak to the media at a press conference on the second day of the 2018 NATO Summit in Brussels, Belgium, on July 12, 2018. (Sean Gallup / Getty Images)During his presidential campaign, Trump caused concern among NATO members by saying he would not rule out the U.S. leaving the alliance. According to the president-elect, European countries are not contributing enough and &quot;should play fair.&quot; Trump&apos;s statement that he would allow Russia &quot;to do whatever it wanted&quot; to NATO member countries failing to meet defense spending criteria sparked even bigger outrage. &quot;No, I would not protect you,&quot; Trump said at a February rally in Conway, South Carolina. &quot;In fact, I would encourage them (Russia) to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay. You got to pay your bills.&quot; For years, Trump demanded that NATO countries spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense, a target reached by 23 NATO countries out of 32 in 2024. All states that border Russia spend over 2 percent of their defense. As it frequently happens, on Jan. 7, Trump changed his desires, saying he wants NATO member states to spend 5 percent of their GDP on defense, a figure currently reached by zero NATO countries, including the U.S. Since collective defense against aggression is the foundation of NATO, the U.S. reneging on its commitments would collapse the alliance. Meanwhile, Vice President-elect J.D. Vance told NBC News that Trump has no intention of withdrawing from NATO. Trump wants NATO countries to &quot;actually carry their share of the defense burden,&quot; Vance added. Meanwhile, the doors to Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO were never really opened, and now it looks like they are shutting completely. Since its independence, Ukraine made a number of attempts to join the alliance, seen as the only real guarantee for the country&apos;s security. In 2008, Ukraine sent an official application for a NATO Membership Action Plan (MAP), which if approved, would set the road for the country to join the alliance once all the criteria would be met. U.S. President George Bush, a Republican, was a key supporter of Ukraine&apos;s desire to join the alliance. The main opponents of Ukraine&apos;s potential membership were Germany and France, and despite a U.S.-led push to persuade German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy to welcome Kyiv, neither had budged. When the Democrats took the White House, the question of NATO membership for Ukraine was off the table, with neither President Barack Obama nor Biden supporting the Ukrainian aspiration. Under Ukraine&apos;s pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, who ruled the country between 2010 and 2014, the commission for preparing the country for NATO membership and the National Center for Euro-Atlantic Integration were dismantled. According to Ukrainian polls, before Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine in 2014, slightly over 20 percent of the country&apos;s population supported joining NATO. Following Russia&apos;s occupation of Ukraine&apos;s Crimea and the eastern part of Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, over 50 percent of Ukrainians said they would vote for NATO membership. Following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, the number of Ukrainians supporting NATO membership jumped to over 80 percent. In September 2022, as Russian troops were occupying parts of five Ukrainian regions, Kyiv officially applied to join the alliance. The U.S., under Biden&apos;s leadership, didn&apos;t support Ukraine&apos;s request. &quot;It was Biden and (Olaf) Scholz primarily who were putting the brakes on any invitation for Ukraine to NATO during the Vilnius Summit, for example. When other countries, most notably Central and Eastern Europe, the U.K., and even France, to a certain extent, were far more in favor at that time,&quot; Burnett said. &quot;Trump&apos;s rhetoric has the effect of absolutely putting in complete misinformation and disinformation about this particular question and America&apos;s willingness to actually have Ukraine in NATO and invite Ukraine to NATO.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s potential accession to NATO is not the reason for Russia&apos;s attack, Burnett said, adding that Putin has repeatedly hinted that he does not recognize Ukraine as a sovereign state.

(Leon Neal/Getty Images)&quot;Putin invaded Ukraine because he doesn&apos;t see it as a state, he doesn&apos;t believe that it has the right to exist as a state, and he&apos;s a neo-imperialist.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 8 that the absence of NATO membership and concrete security guarantees contributed to Russia&apos;s decision to launch the full-scale invasion. &quot;Putin realized no one would stand up for Ukraine. He thought he could destroy us, but the Ukrainian army proved him wrong,&quot; Zelensky said. According to Burnett, Trump has also shown neo-imperialist views, especially given his recent controversial statements about turning Canada into &quot;the 51st U.S. state&quot; or &quot;buying&quot; Greenland. Trump does not believe in alliances or the liberal world order, Burnett added. The expert said several factors will influence Ukraine&apos;s future NATO bid. Trump&apos;s decision may be affected by Republicans who support Ukraine. Much will depend on Europe, how much its states are willing to spend on their defense, and whether Washington will be satisfied. Ukraine will bear a heavy burden, but eventually, it will be difficult to predict any scenario at this point. &quot;Trump is unpredictable,&quot; Burnett said. &quot;If anyone tells you they know what Trump&apos;s going to do, they are lying.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/despite-trumps-claims-russia-didnt-invade-ukraine-because-of-nato/	2025-01-08T12:10:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192846806.jpg

Hungary's FM condemns Ukraine’s bill to suspend Russian energy transit, says his country will block Kyiv's EU accession	Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto condemned a Ukrainian parliamentary bill proposing the suspension of Russian oil and gas transit through Ukraine during martial law, calling the measure &quot;unacceptable&quot; in a Facebook post on Jan. 8. &quot;The reality is that in the EU, member states collectively and unanimously decide on the admission of new members. In other words, each member state has to vote in favor,&quot; Szijjarto said, emphasizing Hungary&apos;s influence over Ukraine&#x2019;s EU aspirations. The bill, submitted on Jan. 7 by ex-President Petro Poroshenko and members of the opposition European Solidarity party, would ban Russian energy transit through Ukrainian territory. Ukraine had already decided not to renew its gas transit deal with Russia beyond Dec. 31, 2024, but continues to allow Russian oil transit via the Druzhba pipeline under a contract valid until the end of 2029. Szijjarto argued that Ukraine has obligations under its EU association agreement to support the bloc&apos;s energy security by maintaining transportation routes. &quot;Each state has the sovereign right to decide from where and how it buys the energy resources it needs to function, and no one has the right to impose more expensive energy resources on another country,&quot; he said. Hungary, along with Slovakia and Austria, remains heavily reliant on Russian gas purchased through Gazprombank, which is under Western sanctions. Szijjarto claimed that closing energy routes would harm Hungary and violate EU expectations for Ukraine&#x2019;s integration. On Jan. 7, Szijjarto also accused Ukraine of exacerbating Europe&#x2019;s economic challenges by halting the transit, allegedly leading to a rise in gas prices on the EU market. Hungary has repeatedly drawn criticism for its Moscow-friendly stance, including blocking sanctions against Russia and aid to Ukraine. Szijjarto, who continues to visit Russia during the war, has set Hungary apart from other EU nations in its approach to the conflict.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-condemns-ukraines-bill-on-halting-russian-energy-transit-emphasizes-veto-over-eu-membership-decisions/	2025-01-08T10:51:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1252632914.jpg
Garry Kasparov: 'You never hear Russian opposition actually say Ukraine must win'	The Russian opposition is an odd bunch. While not supporting Russia&apos;s brutal all-out war against Ukraine and its people, the leaders of the so-called opposition don&apos;t want their country to lose. A number of those who oppose Russian President Vladimir Putin and his regime have petitioned for the West to lift sanctions imposed on Russia for the war it had begun and the war crimes it had committed. Garry Kasparov, Russian chess grandmaster and political activist, is not among them. Supporting Ukraine militarily and making sure it wins is a moral imperative, says Kasparov. A staunch critic of authoritarianism, Kasparov wrote about the dangers posed by Putin&apos;s rule for years. His 2015 book, &quot;Winter Is Coming: Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped,&quot; outlined Russia&apos;s political threat to global security. Over the past three years, Kasparov has repeatedly argued that any chance at Russia becoming a democratic country not only requires its total military defeat but a shedding of its imperialistic legacy &#x2014; a stance not widely embraced by other Russian opposition figures. In an interview with the Kyiv Independent, Kasparov shared his thoughts on the current state of the Russian opposition, why they&apos;re looking for a &quot;good tsar&quot; to replace Putin, and why he&apos;ll push back at those who insist it&apos;s &quot;Putin&apos;s war&quot; rather than Russia&apos;s war. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. The Kyiv Independent: Living in the West, you&apos;re well-placed to comment on its perceptions of Russia. There are these centuries-old ideas like the &quot;Russian soul&quot; or the warning not to &quot;poke the Russian bear.&quot; Do you think the enduring popularity of these ideas has contributed to both the West&apos;s fear of Russian escalation but also this misplaced compassion for Russians as some tortured souls who are just misunderstood? Garry Kasparov: You know, I think it&apos;s a matter of looking for a black cat in a dark room &#x2014; something that is simply not there. That&apos;s the crux of the problem. I remember, back when I was younger, my friend Yury Afanasyev, a brilliant historian, said that Russian literature was one of the most fertile sources of Russian nationalism. At the time, I instinctively disagreed. But now I see he was right. American exceptionalism is rooted in tangible concepts like living standards, respect for human rights, and the rule of law. Russian exceptionalism, on the other hand, leans more toward the mystical. It&apos;s tied to the notion that being Russian means having a special connection to a higher power. However, Russian history provides no evidence of such a unique connection. We need to delve deeply and understand, on a fundamental level, why the idea of the &quot;Russian soul&quot; remains so resistant to external influences. The war in Ukraine has shown us that when we celebrated the fall of communism in 1991, we failed to grasp that communism was merely a facade for an underlying imperialist matrix. Whether it&apos;s the tsars, the Bolsheviks, or Putin, this imperialism always finds a way to emerge. I&apos;ve been saying for the past three years that there&apos;s only one way to dismantle this imperial matrix: the Ukrainian flag has to fly over Sevastopol again. As long as the idea of Russia&apos;s messianic mission endures, nothing will truly change. You need to shatter it with a visual shock. This is likely the best &#x2014; perhaps the only &#x2014; way to give Russia a chance to reform itself into a normal nation-state in the true sense of the word. The Kyiv Independent: One might say that living abroad can deepen or distance one&apos;s understanding of their home country. How has it been for you and the way you look at Russia? Garry Kasparov: Undoubtedly, when you step away, you lose a certain connection to things on the ground. Some things are no longer tied to your immediate senses. However, if you want to analyze the bigger picture, distance can be helpful because you&apos;re no longer caught up in the daily routine. From afar, you gain a sense of objectivity. After all, why do you need to be on the inside to understand what&apos;s happening &#x2014; especially when you&apos;ve been predicting it for so long? My first warning about Vladimir Putin and the potential dangers he posed came on Jan. 4, 2001, in a piece I wrote for The Wall Street Journal. When he began attacking free media and television, I immediately recognized the signs &#x2014; his statements like &quot;once KGB, always KGB,&quot; and actions like restoring the conservative Soviet anthem. The writing was on the wall. On April 25, 2005, during his State of the Nation address, he declared that &quot;the collapse of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.&quot; That statement was the defining moment. It was a clear declaration of intent to rebuild the Russian Empire &#x2014; not necessarily within the same borders, but rather a return to the kind of world where the underlying principle is that &quot;might makes right.&quot; This is the world Putin understands. What&apos;s tragic is that even now, after so much blood has been spilled, there are still people in the free world trying to find some kind of compromise or middle ground to return to. What they fail to recognize is that you cannot negotiate with this kind of evil for a simple reason: Putin views this as a war of destruction, not a war for territorial gains. Giving him a piece of Ukrainian territory won&apos;t change his calculations &#x2014; it will only whet his appetite. His ultimate goal includes the destruction of Ukrainian statehood because Ukrainian statehood is one of the pillars of this world order he seeks to dismantle.

(Contributor / Getty Images)When you examine the attitudes of politicians in the West &#x2014; in Germany, Britain, or America &#x2014; it&apos;s striking. Even after (the occupation of) Crimea, after countless wars, after Syria, many still fail to grasp the situation. Looking at the world&apos;s conflicts today, you see Putin as a spider at the center of the web. Yet, there remains a persistent tendency among many Western politicians to seek common ground, negotiate, and find ways to avoid the magic word &#x2014; escalation. This approach is utterly misguided because the surest way to escalate is to show weakness. Everyone knows that when facing a predator, you must hold your ground and look it in the eye. If you turn your back, you&apos;re done for. The Kyiv Independent: With increasing discussions about the possibility of negotiations and freezing conflict lines even among Ukrainian officials, the prospect of the Ukrainian flag flying over Sevastopol again, unfortunately, seems distant. Do you think the lack of a decisive military defeat could further radicalize pro-war sentiments in Russia? Garry Kasparov: I don&apos;t think there&apos;s a strong pro-war sentiment in Russia. Instead, it&apos;s more about accepting the war as inevitable. There&apos;s very little opposition to it &#x2014; let&apos;s be honest. At its peak, perhaps 15 percent of people opposed the war on moral grounds. I&apos;m skeptical of any numbers coming from Putin&apos;s Russia, but the so-called Crimean consensus &#x2014; 86 percent in favor &#x2014; likely reflects the true mindset. In the early days of the full-scale invasion, I don&apos;t think more than 10 percent of the population opposed the war on moral grounds, which still amounts to 15 to 20 million people. Those who wholeheartedly supported the war were a smaller group, likely a surge of fervent supporters. The rest were more conformist, going along with it because the war brought some material benefits. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s the same fanatical belief in the cause as there was in Nazi Germany or Stalin&apos;s Soviet Union because there&apos;s no real future in this for most people. But there&apos;s compliance because there&apos;s not much else to do. If you look at the living standards in Russia, the full-scale invasion has actually acted like a drug, inflating everything, including people&apos;s earnings. While it may not last, it created a kind of new consensus in society. Putin managed to avoid massive mobilization from big cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg, drawing most soldiers from the countryside, poor regions, and prisons. So far, the war hasn&apos;t had the same impact on society as mass mobilization would have, nor has it caused body bags to arrive in Moscow or St. Petersburg. Remains of Russian soldiers are found in the Bakhmut battle zone, in Sloviansk, in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine on June 29, 2024.

(Libkos/Getty Images)I see no evidence that any potential deal could be made. And while I&apos;m not in favor of a deal, that&apos;s not my decision. I understand that the Ukrainian leadership must deal with reality. We also have to acknowledge that the cowardly stance of the free world has left Ukraine with very few options on the table. It&apos;s a shame that all the weapons developed and manufactured in America &#x2014; specifically to fight Russia &#x2014; are still collecting dust in storage or sitting unused in the deserts of California and Nevada. The NATO alliance, which was created for the sole purpose of stopping Russian aggression in Europe, is now debating whether Ukraine belongs in it. Ukraine is the only country that has fought and is still fighting for NATO&apos;s core mission &#x2014; not sending troops to Afghanistan or Iraq but preventing a Russian invasion. While the idea of the Ukrainian flag flying over Sevastopol may take longer than we all hope, I still believe that without a decisive military defeat, there won&apos;t be substantial change in Russia. The Kyiv Independent: Why do you think some opposition figures &#x2014; such as Ilya Yashin, Yulia Navalnaya, and her late husband, Alexei Navalny &#x2014; often frame their arguments to the Russian public against Russian aggression in economic terms rather than moral ones? Garry Kasparov: Because they live within this paradigm of good Putin, bad Putin, good Tsar, bad Tsar, with no real interest in eliminating the imperial nature of the Russian state. This is the fundamental difference. When people talk about the Russian opposition, I ask: opposition to what? Reducing everything to Putin and his entourage is historically wrong because the true foundation of Russian aggression is the Russian Empire itself &#x2014; its imperial mindset. You can talk about corruption, but in a way, it actually helped Ukraine. Without it, the Russian army could have been much stronger. Thanks to the corruption of Russian generals, who stole probably half of the military budget, Ukraine has had a better chance of survival. Ultimately, the whole idea of continuing to expose corruption is irrelevant &#x2014; corruption makes Putin weaker, not stronger. Many of them dream of the day they can return to Russia, campaign, and address Russian voters. But if they see themselves doing that, they think they need to say, &quot;We never took the other side, even when our country was wrong; we tried to stay neutral.&quot; Honestly, that&apos;s a moral dilemma I don&apos;t understand. For me, it&apos;s clear: we&apos;re fighting Putin, Putin&apos;s fascism, and everything connected to him. At the core of it all is this imperial matrix, and we have to win the war. The Ukrainian army is the only force fighting against it. So, helping Ukraine and supporting the army with all available means is the right decision. That&apos;s the only moral position &#x2014; it&apos;s really that simple. Ukraine&apos;s victory must include a full restoration of Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity. It must also include reparations to be paid. Russia must pay for this. It is crucial to punish war criminals, whether that happens in The Hague, in Russia, or by whatever international tribunal, and there should be no compromise on this. Someone might hear this and think, &quot;Why don&apos;t you (and other members of the Russian opposition) just find common ground? Why don&apos;t you work together?&quot; I&apos;m happy to work together, as long as we see the world through the same lens. Yes, we can argue about many things, but when it comes to fundamental moral issues &#x2014; matters of life and death &#x2014; that&apos;s what truly matters.

(Axel Schmidt/Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: Do you think that&apos;s why they insist on calling it &quot;Putin&apos;s war&quot; rather than Russia&apos;s war? Garry Kasparov: Absolutely, that&apos;s the point. As I&apos;ve mentioned elsewhere, it&apos;s not about whether Putin personally killed someone &#x2014; he probably did early on in his career &#x2014; but he gives orders, and those orders are executed. I haven&apos;t heard of mass desertion in the Russian military, just some desertion, but not on a large scale. These are orders being carried out, and many acts of cruelty show this isn&apos;t just about Putin; it&apos;s a mentality. Ignoring this and claiming it&apos;s all Putin&apos;s doing is an attempt to distort the truth. It&apos;s not politics, and to suggest otherwise is morally wrong. As much as I don&apos;t want to argue, if people continue to say this is Putin&apos;s war, I will push back, rejecting that notion as absolutely inconceivable. It&apos;s simply ignoring reality. I&apos;m happy to debate when there are many unknowns, but no one knows better than those fighting on the Russian side that they plan to destroy Ukraine. They are attacking kindergartens and hospitals &#x2014; they know exactly what they&apos;re doing when they press the button to launch missile and drone attacks. Who presses that button? It&apos;s not just Putin. The Kyiv Independent: In retrospect, what was the Russian opposition&apos;s greatest failure leading to 2022? Garry Kasparov: The last moment the Russian opposition had a chance to change things was back in 2011-2012 after Putin returned to power. Unfortunately, we couldn&apos;t generate enough momentum with the protests on the streets of Moscow. It was over after that. Over the next decade, it became clear that the system was fake. You could have participated in some elections, but they were absolutely meaningless. What did those elections accomplish? I had several debates with (members of the Russian opposition) about this. My point was simple: if you find yourself in a bad position, like in chess, it doesn&apos;t mean you have to make a bad move. Many young people were misled by the claims that they only needed to go out and protest. But what was the goal? Putin was firmly in power, and these opposition activities, without clear goals, couldn&apos;t change anything inside the country. They only created the wrong image in the free world. While in exile, I&apos;ve met with top politicians and given interviews. Whenever I spoke out about this, people would say, &quot;Mr. Kasparov, you&apos;re a great chess player, but we&apos;re talking about Russia, not the Soviet Union. You have Navalny, you have others.&quot; But by saying so, they were essentially helping Putin build his war machine and providing cover for him. A good example was back in 2018 or 2019, just before COVID. The question arose about restoring Russia&apos;s membership in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), the Strasbourg Court of Human Rights. I wrote an open letter to Heiko Maas, then Germany&apos;s Foreign Affairs Minister, saying it was absolutely immoral. Russia had violated every provision of that organization &#x2014; every rule. They were occupying Ukraine&apos;s sovereign land, just as they had done with Georgia. He, of course, never responded to me directly, but there was an indirect response. He gave another interview, saying, &quot;Yes, we&apos;ve heard some pushback,&quot; without naming me. He also mentioned having a letter from 39 human rights organizations in Russia supporting the restoration of Russia&apos;s membership in the Strasbourg Human Rights Court. Meanwhile, some organizations are pretending that they&apos;re operating in Russia. It&apos;s clear that it&apos;s about funding. Millions of dollars are still being wasted on these fake activities in Russia by organizations that never did anything useful there. Now, in exile, they continue pretending. They claim they must protect their people, but I say stop this nonsense. Nothing is happening in Russia. These people pretend they&apos;re making a difference. They speak about demonstrations and say they&apos;re against the war, but that&apos;s not enough.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)We must support Ukraine&apos;s victory in this war. You never hear them say Ukraine must win. It&apos;s always about stopping the war, but at this point, maybe even Putin wants to stop it for his own reasons. There is no common ground between us. This is unfortunate because it creates bad optics, but the reality is that most of the Russian opposition, or those who believe they are opposition, don&apos;t realize that it&apos;s not enough. They still hold on to the idea of a &quot;good Putin&quot; alternative, essentially wanting to replace the bad Putin with a &quot;good Tsar.&quot; The Kyiv Independent: Given the current state of the Russian opposition, particularly with so many figures now in exile, what do you believe is the most effective approach to challenging Putin&apos;s regime and supporting Russia&apos;s future? Garry Kasparov: Well, I&apos;d like to ask again &#x2014; what opposition? This so-called opposition has failed to make meaningful change, and I don&apos;t see how anything can be done at this point except supporting Ukraine in winning the war. Right now, it&apos;s about surviving this onslaught and winning. This illustrates the key differences in our approaches. From the very beginning of the full-scale invasion, I proposed an idea later supported by Mikhail Khodorkovsky: we should offer every Russian who opposes the war and wants to leave the country the chance to do so after signing a declaration. We worked out the Berlin Declaration, which was a mild statement compared to the Free Russia Forum Council&apos;s format, but it contained three key points: the war is criminal, the regime is illegitimate, and Crimea is Ukraine. It&apos;s a simple test &#x2014; if someone is willing to sign it, we need to find a way for them to leave the country, obtain a visa, and find a place in the free world. There are several important aspects to this plan. One is that it can impact the intellectual class in Russia &#x2014; people involved in finance, business, IT, and engineering, including those who could possess the kind of knowledge that would have them working on the development of missiles. I&apos;m not offering a moral defense for them, but before criticizing anyone, we need to give them a chance to leave. So far, Putin has gained a significant ideological advantage because these people see that the world doesn&apos;t want them. As a result, hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of Russians &#x2014; crucial to Putin&apos;s war machine &#x2014; remain in Russia. Without them, Putin&apos;s economy, especially his war economy, would collapse. This was the plan, but strangely, many of our colleagues in the opposition were not happy. They argued that we can&apos;t let people leave because who will protest against Putin? But I don&apos;t see people needing to stay just to protest. We could help these people leave, work with them, and build what I call &quot;Russian Taiwan&quot; &#x2014; a network of the future free Russia. When the moment comes, and the regime collapses, those who want to return can come back, and they would be the new ruling elite. But the opposition rejected this idea. For example, did you ever hear Yulia Navalnaya talk about something along those lines? She has met with many prime ministers and presidents but never mentioned anything like it. Instead, they all rejected the idea because, in their view, it wasn&apos;t a good one. That&apos;s exactly what Putin needs &#x2014; people to stay and oppose the idea of leaving. So, if someone calls themselves a member of the Russian opposition, tell me, what is your goal? I know what our goal is. The Free Russia Forum, which I co-founded, believes that Ukraine must win &#x2014; that is our only chance. We must work toward Ukraine&apos;s victory and create momentum for Russia&apos;s defeat. Only then can we begin to consider what comes next.	https://kyivindependent.com/garry-kasparov-without-decisive-military-defeat-there-wont-be-change-in-russia/	2025-01-08T10:30:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2071877887.jpg
Zelensky addresses Trump’s comments on NATO, stresses security guarantees	President Volodymyr Zelensky called for caution in interpreting U.S. policy following President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s comments linking Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO aspirations to Russia&#x2019;s invasion, during a Jan. 8 meeting with Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen. The Ukrainian president argued that the absence of NATO membership and concrete security guarantees contributed to Russia&#x2019;s decision to launch the full-scale invasion. &quot;Putin realized no one would stand up for Ukraine. He thought he could destroy us, but the Ukrainian army proved him wrong,&quot; Zelensky said. Trump had criticized President Joe Biden for provoking Russia&#x2019;s invasion, claiming Ukraine&#x2019;s potential NATO membership had long been a significant concern for Moscow. &quot;That&#x2019;s been like written in stone. And Biden said, &#x2018;No, they should be able to join NATO.&#x2019; Then Russia has somebody right on their doorstep,&quot; Trump said. Zelensky dismissed conclusions about NATO, referencing Ukraine&#x2019;s recent access to Patriot missile systems and other NATO-standard weapons. &quot;Do you remember when Ukraine was told that Patriot systems are only available to NATO countries? Either we have been in NATO for a long time, or we should not jump to conclusions,&quot; he said. Finnish foreign minister emphasized that Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership poses no threat to other countries. &quot;This narrative is similar to the one Russia has long used, blaming NATO and its so-called &apos;enlargement&apos; for its own aggression,&quot; Valtonen said. Reports from The Wall Street Journal suggest Trump&#x2019;s team may propose delaying Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for Western arms supplies and European peacekeepers to monitor a potential ceasefire. While Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership remains a long-term goal, Zelensky reiterated the need for robust security guarantees in the immediate term. Ukrainian envoy Andrii Melnyk echoed this sentiment on Dec. 27, emphasizing that diplomatic efforts currently center on strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s defense capabilities rather than immediate NATO accession. Zelensky expressed cautious optimism about working with the incoming U.S. administration, reaffirming Ukraine&#x2019;s commitment to achieving a diplomatic resolution to the war by 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-addresses-trumps-comments-on-nato-stresses-security-guarantees/	2025-01-08T10:20:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185712185.jpg
As Russian losses in Ukraine mount, Putin faces ‘devastating’ demographic timebomb	Russian losses in Ukraine are helping fuel a demographic timebomb that could see the country&#x2019;s population reduced by half by the end of the century, experts have told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;The impact on Russian society is devastating,&#x201D; said Harley Balzer, emeritus professor of government and international affairs at Georgetown University. &#x201C;From Russia&apos;s perspective, (winning the war in Ukraine) is the smaller problem. The bigger issue is, is it going to be a viable country afterward regardless?&#x201D; According to Ukrainian figures, on Jan. 7, Russian losses passed another grim milestone, surpassing 800,000. The figures from the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces do not specify killed or wounded. The overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. According to Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, more than half of these losses &#x2014; 427,000 &#x2014; occurred during 2024, accelerating as the year progressed with no sign of slowing. The bodies of killed Russian soldiers in the Bakhmut area in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. June 29, 2024 (Pablo Miranzo/Anadolu via Getty Images)Russian forces suffered their deadliest day since the start of the full-scale invasion on Dec. 19, taking 2,200 casualties. For comparison, the U.K. suffered 750,000 military casualties during the six years of World War II. Ukraine has published daily estimates of the number of killed and wounded Russian soldiers since the early days of the full-scale invasion. Initially, there was some skepticism about how accurate the numbers were, but as Ukraine&apos;s Western allies began to publicly release their own estimates of Russian losses, they have been broadly in line with those coming out of Kyiv. Compounding the staggering losses sustained during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine is the fact Russia was already facing severe demographic issues before it launched the full-scale war. &#x201C;The Russian Federation was trapped long before its invasion of Ukraine in what I described as a demographic straitjacket,&#x201D; Nicholas Eberstadt, who holds the Henry Wendt Chair in Political Economy at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), told the Kyiv Independent. Eberstadt says that in terms of many indicators such as urbanization, education attainment levels, and family formation patters, Russia presents as a &#x201C;typical European country.&#x201D; &#x201C;What&apos;s not at all typical European is the very low level of human capital that we see in Russian Federation,&#x201D; he says.

(Rostislav Netisov / AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;Life expectancy for young men is on par with a fourth-world country. Life expectancy at age 15 for a Russian man right before the (COVID-19) pandemic was about the same as his counterpart in Haiti.&#x201D; A large study into why Russian males had such short life expectancies published in 2014 concluded one of the main factors in early deaths was excessive alcohol consumption. Other factors cited in a more recent investigation last year by the independent Russian media outlet Cherta, included high rates of murder, suicide, car crashes, and other fatal accidents. On top of this, Russia has long-faced a decline in birth rates which Eberstadt says started to go down after 2015. &#x201C;Demographers look at what they call a total fertility rate (TFR) which is births per women,&#x201D; Eberstadt says, adding: &#x201C;You need basically 2.1 in most countries to maintain your population.&#x201D; According to figures from the World Bank, Russia&#x2019;s TFR was last at 2.1 in 1988. After declining steadily it began to rise again after 2000, but only reached a peak of around 1.8 in 2015, before falling again to 1.4 by 2022. Recognizing the impending demographic timebomb, Russian President Vladimir Putin has gone to great lengths to encourage his people to have more babies. Some of the efforts from the Kremlin have been relatively benign, with Putin simply calling on women to get pregnant for the sake of the country. &#x201C;If we want to survive as an ethnic group &#x2014; well, or as ethnic groups inhabiting Russia &#x2014; there must be at least two children (per family),&quot; he said in a speech in February last year. Other efforts, such as a crackdown on access to abortions, have been far more insidious. Yet even with these efforts, the Kremlin only hopes to reach a TFR of 1.8 by 2036, far below the 2.1 needed to sustain the Russian population, estimated to be around 146 million currently.

(Yuri Kadobnov / AFP via Getty Images)And one of the biggest obstacles to achieving this goal is the war in Ukraine, though it&#x2019;s more complicated than simply having fewer men around to father children. &#x201C;The number of dead soldiers, especially given how many of them are 40 to 60-years-old, is not the crucial thing here,&#x201D; Balzer says, adding: &#x201C;The crucial thing is what it&apos;s doing to Russian society.&#x201D; Balzar points to the soaring rates of PTSD and alcohol and drug addiction among Russian soldiers returning home, as well as an increase in murder and violent crime incidents involving veterans. &#x201C;That&apos;s an environment where people are anxious to have more children,&#x201D; Balzer says. Declining populations and low TFRs are not problems faced only by Russia &#x2014; many developed nations currently have TFRs below 2.1, including the U.S. (1.7) and the U.K. (1.6). &#x201C;The whole world is facing what might be a 25% decline in population by the end of the century, but Russia is going to be a lot worse,&#x201D; Balzer says. &#x201C;Some demographers are suggesting that Russia&apos;s population in 2100 will be half of what it is today.&#x201D; &#x201C;It doesn&apos;t have to be, but if Putin wants to keep fighting this war, it is going to make it a lot worse.&#x201D; Aside from declining birth rates, there&#x2019;s also what Eberstadt refers to as the &#x201C;Russian paradox.&#x201D; While the populations of developed nations, even while in decline numerically, continue to innovate and contribute to the fields of science, technology, and general progress, Russia remains somewhat of a backwater despite having relatively high levels of education. &#x201C;There&apos;s a huge pool of talent in (Russia), really impressive talent,&#x201D; Eberstadt says. &#x201C;What&apos;s mysterious, if not bizarre, is how little of that talent nowadays translates into productive knowledge or into economic wealth.&#x201D; Faced with half the current population, Russia will struggle even more to be what Balzer referred to as a &#x201C;viable country.&#x201D; Although the future looks bleak for Russia, any negative effects of an impending demographic crisis are unlikely to occur soon enough to stop its ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &#x201C;If Putin is all out&#x2026; &#xA0;then he doesn&apos;t really care (about the demographic crisis),&#x201D; John Foreman CBE, the U.K.&apos;s former defense attache in Moscow from 2019 to 2022, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Putin&apos;s willing to sacrifice absolutely everything for the front.&#x201D; &#x201C;And it seems to me that they have just about enough troops and volunteers and others to keep the fight going. It&apos;s not about absolute numbers, it&apos;s about relative numbers, and at the same time, Ukraine is suffering its own problems,&#x201D; he adds.

(Roman Pilipey / AFP via Getty Images)Ukraine also faces its own demographic crisis, albeit one largely forced upon it by Russia. Ukraine&apos;s population has declined by over 10 million since Russia first invaded in 2014 and fell to an estimated 37 million by January 2024. &#x201C;It&apos;s a race to the bottom,&#x201D; Foreman says, adding: &#x201C;It&apos;s basically which side can stay in the longest.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-losses-in-ukraine-fuelling-devastating-demographic-timebomb-experts-say/	2025-01-08T09:38:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2003913401.jpg
Finland to host NATO Baltic summit, address Russia’s 'shadow fleet' sabotage threats	Finland will host a summit for NATO member states with access to the Baltic Sea on Jan. 14 to address regional security threats, including the suspected Russian sabotage, the Finnish president&apos;s office announced on Jan. 8. The meeting, co-organized by Finland and Estonia, will focus on enhancing NATO&apos;s presence in the Baltic Sea and responding to risks posed by Russia&#x2019;s so-called shadow fleet, a group of tankers allegedly used for sanction evasion and espionage. The summit follows recent damage to Baltic Sea infrastructure, with four telecommunication cables and one power cable severed on Dec. 25. Finnish authorities suspect the Russian shadow vessel Eagle S of involvement in the sabotage. &quot;The topic of the summit will be the security of the Baltic Sea region, especially measures required to secure the critical underwater infrastructure,&quot; the statement reads. Attendees will include NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, leaders from Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Germany, Poland, Sweden, and European Commission Vice President Henna Virkkunen. NATO has deployed up to 10 vessels to guard undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea until April, Finnish broadcaster Yle reported. The alliance is also bolstering its military presence to enhance situational awareness and deter potential threats. The alliance has prioritized protecting critical undersea infrastructure since May, with its Maritime Center for Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure leading efforts to counter growing Russian sabotage activities. Denmark recently reported two Russian-registered vessels operating suspiciously near Sweden and Denmark. Concerns over Russian sabotage have increased since Western nations began supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022. The summit underscores NATO&#x2019;s commitment to securing the Baltic Sea amid rising tensions with Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/finland-to-host-nato-baltic-summit-address-russias-shadow-fleet-sabotage-threats-presidential-office-says/	2025-01-08T08:58:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/40376926_2181642765411801_4095442172197732352_n.jpg

Next Ramstein meeting may be its last, Polish defense minister says	Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz announced on Jan. 8 his participation in the upcoming Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting on Jan. 9, hinting that it could be the group&apos;s last meeting in the current format. Kosiniak-Kamysz said the format might change after President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Trump has signalled his intention to break with the current U.S. strategy concerning Ukraine. The UDCG consists of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. &quot;I believe NATO should take on a greater burden,&quot; Kosiniak-Kamysz said, citing its expanded role in activities such as defending Polish Rzesz&#xF3;w&#x2013;Jasionka Airport, a key logistics hub for resupplying Ukraine. The Jan. 9 meeting will focus on strengthening Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities through 2027, including air force, armor, artillery, drone, de-mining, missile defense, and maritime security needs, according to a Pentagon statement on Jan. 7. Kosiniak-Kamysz praised U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the architect of the Ramstein format, for his steadfast support of Poland, U.S. troop presence in the country, and aid to Ukraine. &quot;This (Ramstein) format is broader than NATO, and its success is thanks to Austin&#x2019;s leadership,&quot; he said. NATO has already begun transitioning to greater involvement, with member states agreeing in June to pass partial control of weapons supply coordination to Kyiv &#x2014; a move aimed at ensuring continuity under shifting U.S. leadership, according to Politico. Trump&#x2019;s plans for the UDCG remain unclear, though his comments blaming President Joe Biden for provoking Russia&#x2019;s invasion by supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO aspirations have stirred debate. The incoming administration has yet to provide a detailed framework for its proposed ceasefire negotiations or changes to military aid programs. The Jan. 9 meeting will serve as a pivotal moment for international efforts to sustain Ukraine&apos;s defense amid uncertainty over U.S. policy shifts.	https://kyivindependent.com/greater-burden-poland-calls-for-natos-greater-role-as-ramstein-meeting-may-be-last-under-current-format-defmin-says/	2025-01-08T06:58:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2079424446.jpg

Ukraine strikes Russian command post in Donetsk Oblast, military reports	Ukrainian forces carried out a precision strike against a command post of Russia&apos;s 8th Combined Arms Army in Russian-occupied Khartsyzk in Donetsk Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 8. The military said that Russia has seized the facility to coordinate attacks against Ukrainian forces and civilians, especially in Kurakhove. After weeks of heavy battles, Russia announced earlier this week it had fully captured Kurakhove. &quot;All necessary measures were taken to limit the risk to civilians,&quot; the General Staff noted. Khartsyzk lies around 25 kilometers (15 miles) east of the Russian-held Donetsk and has been occupied by Russia since the start of its aggression in 2014. The General Staff did not specify what weapon was used in the attack or the extent of the damage inflicted. Ukraine fields homemade missiles and long-range drones as well as Western-supplied arms like HIMARS, ATACMS, or Storm Shadow missiles. Similar attacks were reported in recent days, including a precision strike against a Russian command post in Kursk Oblast on Jan. 7 and another one in the same region on Jan. 2. Earlier on Jan. 8, the Ukrainian military announced a successful long-range attack against a Russian oil depot in Saratov Oblast that provided fuel to the nearby Engels-2 airbase.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-russian-command-post-in-donetsk-oblast-military-reports/	2025-01-08T05:52:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2030058326.jpg
Ground Forces chief reports to Zelensky on 155th Brigade, names those responsible for 'systematic shortcomings'	General Mykhailo Drapatyi, Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces chief, reported to President Volodymyr Zelensky on the roots of the problems facing the French-trained 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Brigade and presented solutions, Drapatyi said on Jan. 8. The general&apos;s remarks followed a media investigation that claimed soldiers of the unit, currently deployed near Pokrovsk, have suffered losses and gone AWOL (absent without leave) in large numbers due to poor command and organization within Ukraine&#x2019;s military leadership. &quot;Most of the systemic shortcomings were committed by the Ground Forces Command, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and the Operational Command,&quot; the commander wrote on social media. Drapatyi was appointed to lead the Ground Forces last November, months after the brigade was formed. Without revealing all the details before &quot;all the circumstances are established,&quot; Drapatyi acknowledged &quot;inadequate management,&quot; &quot;mistakes in recruitment,&quot; and &quot;imperfect training planning&quot; within the unit. The commander said the biggest challenge was the &quot;low efficiency and motivation of mid-level commanders who directly manage people.&quot; Relevant solutions are already being implemented, with a focus on &quot;recruiting experienced officers and commanders at all levels,&quot; the general said, adding that the 155th Brigade&#x2019;s soldiers will receive additional training. Service members of the unit will also be provided a hotline, the commander said. &quot;In addition to the official daily reports, I want to have direct contact and hear from the soldiers&#x2026; how our decisions affect their motivation and the real state of affairs,&quot; he added. According to the general, the brigade also received psychologists to strengthen its cohesion while holding positions near Pokrovsk. &quot;The French side has fully fulfilled its obligations to Ukraine,&quot; he stressed. The 155th Brigade was intended to be a flagship project for Ukrainian brigades trained and armed with the assistance of foreign partners. French President Emmanuel Macron announced in June that France would provide training and military supplies as part of this initiative. Despite Paris fulfilling its commitments for training and arms provision, an investigation led by Yurii Butusov, editor-in-chief of Ukrainian media outlet Censor.net, pointed to problems in the brigade&apos;s creation and management, allegedly leading to 1,700 cases of soldiers going AWOL from the unit before firing a shot.	https://kyivindependent.com/ground-forces-chief-reports-to-zelensky-on-155th-brigade-names-those-responsible-for-systematic-shortcomings/	2025-01-08T05:25:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/q132bb595v3e1.jpeg
NATO reportedly sending ships to guard cables under Baltic Sea	A fleet of up to 10 NATO vessels will guard the infrastructure under the Baltic Sea until April, the Finnish broadcaster Yle reported on Jan. 7 after several cables were cut in suspected sabotage. The ships, mainly from Finland and Estonia, will patrol the Gulf of Finland, Yle reported. Over the past six months, several telecommunication and energy cables underneath the Baltic Sea have been damaged, with four telecom cables and one power cable severed on Dec. 25. Only two of those cables of the Christmas incident were repaired by Jan. 7. Authorities suspect the Russian shadow vessel Eagle S of the sabotage. The shadow fleet refers to a group of aging, poorly insured tankers Russia uses to avoid international sanctions on its oil trade. Moscow also uses these vessels for espionage. In a separate initiative, the U.K-led Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) has set up a tracking system to alert allies if a ship poses a threat to undersea cable infrastructure. NATO is increasing its military presence in the Baltic Sea to bolster situational awareness and deter potential threats. Allies are also exploring measures to protect critical undersea infrastructure, supported by NATO&apos;s Maritime Centre for Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure, established in May. NATO officials have raised alarm over a growing number of Russian sabotage operations in Europe since the West threw its support behind Kyiv after the outbreak of the full-scale invasion in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-reportedly-sending-ships-to-guard-cables/	2025-01-08T04:27:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-471415136.jpg
Photos of jailed Belarusian opposition leader appear after almost 2 years of no news	Photos and a video of Viktar Babaryka were published by blogger Raman Pratasevich on Jan. 8 after the jailed Belarusian opposition leader was held incommunicado since February 2023. The footage was released weeks after Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko pardoned 20 political prisoners in an apparent goodwill gesture ahead of the presidential election on Jan. 26. Lukashenko has ruled the country since 1994, cementing his power through widespread repressions, secret police, and electoral fraud. The dictator claimed victory in the last 2020 election after rigging the vote and violently suppressing the subsequent protests and is expected to secure his seventh term later this month. Photos of Babaryka and an excerpt from his video appeal to relatives have been published on the Telegram channel of Pratasevich, formerly a dissident and editor-in-chief of the opposition news channel Nexta who became a regime apologist after his arrest in 2021 and subsequent pardon. The pictures show the opposition leader dressed in black clothes, with a yellow sign designating him as &quot;prone to extremist activities,&quot; writing something on paper. According to the Viasna human rights group, Babaryka has not been seen since Feb. 5, 2023. Pratasevich said he had passed letters between Babaryka and his family members. Babaryka intended to run for the 2020 presidential election but was rejected and, in 2021, sentenced to 14 years in prison on charges of bribery and tax evasion broadly seen as politically motivated. In a similar case last November, photos of imprisoned activist Maria Kalesnikava, who headed Babaryka&apos;s electoral campaign and later worked with another oppositionist, Sviatlana Tsikahnouskaya, emerged after more than 600 days of no communication.	https://kyivindependent.com/babaryka-photo-published/	2025-01-08T04:12:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GgwoqjkWQAAIpIT.jpeg
Trump calls on NATO to raise defense spending benchmark to 5% of GDP	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Jan. 7 that NATO should raise its defense spending benchmark from 2% of GDP to 5%, echoing his earlier calls for Europe to spend more on its security. &quot;I think NATO should have 5%,&quot; Trump said at a news conference in Florida. This confirms earlier reports about the incoming U.S. president urging allies to raise defense spending to a benchmark no NATO member has reached as of now, including the U.S. Trump is not the only one urging defense spending hikes. Other members of the 32-strong alliance see Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Trump&apos;s isolationism as an incentive to take more responsibility for their collective security. Allies are reportedly discussing raising the spending level to 3% by 2030, still below Trump&apos;s proposed target. As of 2025, some NATO members like Italy, Canada, or Spain have not even reached the current 2% target, though the number of allies that do has risen to 24 last year. According to NATO estimates, Poland spent the greatest portion of its GDP on defense (4.12%) in 2024, followed by Estonia (3.43%) and the U.S. (3.38%). Last February, Trump sparked international outrage by saying he would urge Russia to do &quot;whatever the hell they want&quot; to NATO member countries failing to meet defense spending criteria, in a declaration indicating his disregard for the alliance&apos;s collective defense principle.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-calls-on-nato-to-spend-5-of-gdp-on-defense/	2025-01-08T03:17:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190485862.jpg
Poroshenko's party urges ban on Russian oil transit via Ukraine	Ex-President Petro Poroshenko and members of his European Solidarity opposition party submitted a bill on Jan. 7 banning the transit of Russian oil and gas through Ukraine&apos;s territory during martial law. The move came after Ukraine decided not to prolong a deal on the transit of Russian gas to the EU through Ukrainian pipelines past Dec. 31, 2024. Ukraine continues to facilitate the transit of Russian oil via the Druzhba pipeline, fulfilling a contract valid until the end of 2029. &quot;Every day, the Druzhba oil pipeline transports 300,000 barrels of Russian oil... Every day when the halt to Russian oil transit is delayed, tens of millions of dollars flow to Russia,&quot; Poroshenko said at a press briefing. &quot;In 2025 in total, Russia plans to receive $7.5 billion only from the sale of oil through Ukrainian transit.&quot; The text of the bill, signed by Poroshenko and 17 other European Solidarity MPs, has not yet been published. The legislation must be considered by relevant committees, approved in two readings, and signed by the president before becoming law, potentially a lengthy process. Revenues from fossil fuel exports represent a significant part of Russia&apos;s federal budget and play a key role in fueling its war machine in Ukraine. The EU banned the import of Russian seaborne crude oil and certain petroleum products in June 2022 as part of sanctions imposed in response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Certain member states were given exemptions due to their dependency on Russian supplies, allowing them to continue buying Russian pipeline oil. Russian crude continues to flow to Hungary, Czechia, and Slovakia through the southern branch of the Druzhba pipeline, which also runs through Ukraine. Halting the oil transit might fuel further discord between Ukraine and Hungary with Slovakia. The two EU countries, led by Moscow-friendly populists, have already lashed out against Kyiv over its decision not to prolong gas transit, claiming it undermines their energy security.	https://kyivindependent.com/poroshenkos-party-urges-ban-on-russian-oil-transit-via-ukraine/	2025-01-08T02:36:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-94281707.jpg
US lawmakers submit resolution labeling Russia's war in Ukraine genocide	A draft resolution to recognize Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine as genocidal was among the first bills submitted to the new U.S. Congress on Jan. 6., the Congress&#x2019; website showed. The draft resolution was submitted by a bipartisan group of legislators, Ukraine&#x2019;s Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova said in a Facebook post. &quot;Systematic actions against the Ukrainian people committed by Russian forces under the direction of Russian Federation political leadership meets one or more of the criteria under Article II of the Genocide Convention,&quot; the draft resolution&#x2019;s preamble read. The resolution cites the Russian military&#x2019;s intentional targeting of civilians, civilian infrastructure, systematic sexual violence against Ukrainian women, men, and children, as well as the forced deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia. &quot;All crimes committed by the Russian Federation must be reflected in U.S. law to ensure that Russian criminals are punished and to prevent such heinous crimes in the future,&quot; the Ukrainian ambassador wrote in her post. &quot;Currently, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office of Ukraine has opened 170,090 cases of crimes related to the aggression of the Russian Federation (151,698 for war crimes),&quot; Markarova added. The draft resolution calls on the U.S. to condemn Russia and support Ukraine and international jurisdiction against those responsible for Russia&#x2019;s actions. In early 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, the Russian official allegedly overseeing the forced deportations of Ukrainian children to Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-lawmakers-submit-resolution-labeling-russias-war-in-ukraine-genocide/	2025-01-08T02:03:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1754907256.jpg
Azerbaijan's President Aliyev calls Armenia 'fascist state, threat to region'	Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev on Jan. 7 called Armenia effectively a &quot;fascist state,&quot; claiming that Baku might have no other choice but to &quot;destroy&quot; its neighbor&apos;s so-called &quot;fascist ideology.&quot; Azerbaijan and Armenia are bitter rivals, having clashed in multiple territorial and ethnic conflicts since they gained independence three decades ago. Speaking in an interview with local television channels, Aliyev accused Armenian authorities of being bearers of a &quot;fascist ideology&quot; for 30 years, shaping the country in their image. He also called Armenia a &quot;threat to the region.&quot; The Azerbaijani strongman issued thinly veiled threats against Armenia, saying that &quot;fascism must be destroyed. It will be destroyed either by the Armenian leadership or by us. We have no other choice.&quot; In September 2023, Baku&apos;s forces captured the Nagorno-Karabakh region, de jure Azerbaijani territory that, at the time, was de facto ruled by ethnic Armenian authorities and had been a key point of contest between the two countries. Almost the entire 100,000-strong Armenian population fled the region following Azerbaijan&apos;s lightning offensive. As Yerevan and Baku lead bilateral talks on normalizing relations and settling outstanding border disputes, Armenian authorities have accused Azerbaijan, currently the stronger player in the region, of planning further hostilities. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said last December that the Azerbaijani side received proposals on two unresolved issues in the negotiations but has yet to respond. &quot;If Azerbaijan also doesn&#x2019;t have intentions to attack Armenia, then the likelihood of escalation in the region is zero,&quot; Pashinyan said in an interview last month. Aliyev also called on France and other countries to stop providing arms to Armenia and take back the weapons already provided. Yerevan has deepened security cooperation with the West after its traditional ally, Russia, did not step in to prevent Azerbaijan&apos;s attack in 2023 despite having peacekeepers deployed in Nagorno-Karabakh.	https://kyivindependent.com/azerbaijans-president-aliyev-calls-armenia-fascist-state/	2025-01-08T01:45:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2162500509.jpg
Ukraine strikes Russian oil depot supplying fuel to Engels-2 airbase, military confirms	Ukrainian forces attacked a Russian oil depot in Engels, Saratov Oblast, overnight on Jan. 8, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said after reports of drone attacks. The operation, carried out jointly by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence, the Unmanned Systems Forces, and other units, targeted the Kristal Plant used to supply fuel to the nearby Engels-2 airbase, the military said. The statement comes shortly after Russian authorities reported a drone attack in the area, with footage of the burning oil facility circulating on social media. The city of Engels lies around 600 kilometers (370 miles) from the front lines in Ukraine. Saratov Oblast Governor Roman Busargin said Ukrainian drone debris struck an unspecified &quot;industrial facility&quot; around 5:30 a.m. local time amid a &quot;massive&quot; drone attack on the city. No information was immediately available as to the extent of the damage caused. Busargin said that there were no injuries as a result of the attack. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed that 11 Ukrainian attack drones were downed over Saratov Oblast. &quot;The depot&apos;s destruction creates significant logistical problems for Russian strategic aviation and reduces its ability to attack peaceful Ukrainian cities and civilian facilities,&quot; the General Staff said. The Engels-2 base hosts the 121st Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment, operating Tu-160 bombers, and the 184th Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment with the Tupolev Tu-95 MS planes. Russia uses these aircraft to launch mass strikes on Ukraine, often resulting in heavy damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties. Ukrainian forces have previously launched drone strikes targeting the airbase itself.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-oil-depot-in-russias-saratov-oblast-military-confirms/	2025-01-08T01:05:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GgwD6KeaUAAgJXL-1.png
Venezuela detains 3 Ukrainians, accuses them of 'terror' plot	Venezuela&apos;s President Nicolas Maduro announced the detention of three Ukrainians days before his inauguration, calling them &quot;mercenaries&quot; and accusing them of plotting &quot;terrorist&quot; actions, Spanish news agency EFE reported on Jan. 8. Venezuelan authorities also detained two U.S. and two Colombian citizens, raising the same accusations against them. &quot;Today alone, we have captured&#x2026;, seven foreign mercenaries, including two important U.S. mercenaries,&quot; Maduro said at an event in Caracas. The group was planning a terrorist attack against &quot;the peace of Venezuela,&quot; the president alleged. Maduro did not provide evidence to support his claims. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry has not yet commented on Caracas&apos; claims, and a spokesperson did not respond to the Kyiv Independent&apos;s request at the time of publication. Maduro is preparing for his inauguration on Jan. 10 to become the president of Venezuela for the next six years after two consecutive terms, claiming election victory in July 2024 amid widespread reports of fraud. The opposition&#x2019;s presidential nominee, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, also plans to take the presidential oath. The U.S. and several other nations have recognized Urrutia as the legitimate president-elect. The Venezuelan government claims to have detained overall 125 &quot;mercenaries&quot; in November and December, all part of an alleged scheme to attack Maduro&#x2019;s Vice President and Hydrocarbons Minister Delcy Rodriguez. Maduro has a close relationship with Moscow, bolstered by their shared animosity toward the West. Venezuela&apos;s president has denounced Western sanctions imposed against Russia over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and called Caracas and Moscow &quot;loyal allies.&quot; Last summer, two Russian naval ships docked in Venezuela&apos;s La Guaira port after exercises in the North Atlantic, supposedly to &quot;show the flag&quot; in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/venezuela-detains-ukrainians/	2025-01-08T00:31:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2165038982.jpg
Hackers claim to have breached Russia’s real estate database, Moscow denies	A hacker group named Silent Crow has claimed to have hacked and obtained data from Russia&apos;s state cadastre and cartography agency, the independent Russian news outlet Agentstvo reported on Jan. 7. Russia&#x2019;s state register denied the news, issuing a statement that said: &quot;Additional checks of the information published in a number of Telegram channels are currently underway.&quot; The stolen database contained the internal identification of each recording, the name of the real estate&#x2019;s owner (full name or the name of the legal entity), their date of birth, details of documents (passport), address, and sometimes also phone numbers dating until early 2024, Agentstvo reported. Agentstvo randomly selected and checked 15 recordings, which all corresponded to real owners. The hackers claimed to have stolen 2 billion lines, publishing 82 million as proof. It is unclear who is behind the group. The Silent Crow channel where the alleged hack was published was created on Dec. 25. The channel&apos;s only post is from Jan. 6 and concerns the leak. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the group&#x2019;s claims. Many investigative journalists used Russia&#x2019;s state registry to expose corruption by showing if someone&#x2019;s property worth was above their pay grade until 2023, when a Russian law banned the publication of personal information for third parties without the registered person or company&#x2019;s consent. Both Russia and Ukraine have widely used cyberattacks to target government institutions and key businesses during the full-scale war. In December, a Russian-backed cyberattack targeted several state registers overseen by Ukraine&apos;s Justice Ministry.	https://kyivindependent.com/hackers-claimed-to-have-hacked-russias-real-estate-database-moscow-denies/	2025-01-07T23:57:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-615824148.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure 13 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least two civilians and injured at least 13 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 8. Russia launched 64 Shahed-type attack drones and various dummy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Air defenses shot down 41 drones over nine different oblasts, while 22 dummy drones were lost in the airspace, three flew to Russia, and one to Belarus, according to the statement. Three civilians were injured during Russian attacks against the front-line town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Kherson Oblast, two people were killed and nine injured in Russian attacks, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. Three high-rise buildings, five houses, a bus, a garage, and other civilian property was damaged. A civilian was injured and a house damaged during a Russian drone attack against the Shostka community in Sumy Oblast, according to the regional military administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-116/	2025-01-07T23:29:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-08_06-30-09.jpg
Pentagon official coordinating Ukraine aid resigns ahead of Trump inauguration	Laura Cooper, senior Pentagon official leading the Russia and Ukraine office, stepped down as Donald Trump&apos;s inauguration looms, Politico reported on Jan. 6, citing one former and three current officials. A veteran civil servant, Cooper has held senior U.S. Defense Department positions since Trump&apos;s first term in office in 2017 and, more recently, was responsible for coordinating U.S. aid for Ukraine during the full-scale war that broke out in 2022. Politico linked her resignation to the growing uncertainty about upcoming changes in the Pentagon under Trump&apos;s administration, namely regarding the future Ukraine policy. According to the outlet, Cooper&apos;s resignation may also be connected to her testimonies in Trump&apos;s impeachment inquiry in 2019. The proceedings were launched after the then-U.S. president was said to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals by threatening to withhold military aid. Often critical of the Biden administration&apos;s extensive backing of Kyiv, Trump has pledged to bring a swift end to the war by pushing Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table. The incoming U.S. president has often voiced sympathies for Russian President Vladimir Putin and presented Moscow&apos;s worries about Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations as a legitimate concern. At the same time, Trump said he would not &quot;abandon&quot; Ukraine and instead leverage U.S. assistance to push for peace talks. Cooper has been temporarily replaced by Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary for Defense Continuity and Mission Assurance Steven Schleien, but broad personnel changes are expected at the Pentagon after Trump takes office on Jan. 20. With less than two weeks in office left, the Biden administration seeks to deliver as much aid to Ukraine as possible to put it in the strongest possible position in any potential 2025 negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/pentagon-official-coordinating-ukraine-aid-reportedly-resigns/	2025-01-07T22:59:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1178978808--1-.jpg

Zelensky signs law strengthening process for creating, designating list of terrorist organizations	President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a bill on Jan. 7 strengthening the process for the formation and designation of groups and organizations to Ukraine&apos;s terror list. The law, which formally assigns responsibility to Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) to maintain a list of terrorist organizations, is set to better define and name organizations that pose a threat to the country&apos;s national security. Ahead of the legislation, a designated terror list was managed informally through the country&apos;s national security institutions. The bill formally defines mechanism for a group&apos;s inclusion into the list and will name terrorist networks that operate both within Ukraine and abroad &#x2014; regardless of whether they&apos;re a registered legal entity in Ukraine. The list will be administered by the SBU&apos;s Anti-Terrorism Center and will be publicly accessible through the government&apos;s website. The law mandates that political parties, regardless of their activities, not be included on the terror list. Following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukraine, along with a number of Western countries and institutions designated Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-signs-law-strengthening-process-for-creating-designating-list-of-terror-organizations/	2025-01-07T21:45:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/b7dea112-3446-4665-8c29-fcc96bf7e99b--1-.jpg
Upcoming Ramstein summit to focus on supporting Ukraine's defense capabilities through 2027, Pentagon says, as Trump inauguration looms	The Jan. 9 Ramstein-format summit of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) will focus primarily on supporting Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities in establishing a &quot;credible deterrent force&quot; through 2027, the Pentagon said on Jan. 7. &quot;The leaders of (UDCG) will need to endorse roadmaps that articulate Ukraine&apos;s air force, armor, artillery, de-mining, drone, integrated air and missile defense, information technology and maritime security needs and objectives through 2027,&quot; a unnamed defense official is quoted as saying by the Defense Department&apos;s news channel. &quot;These roadmaps are intended to enable donors to plan for and support Ukraine sustainably into the future,&quot; the official added. The statement by Pentagon officials comes ahead of the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 20, who has vowed who has pledged to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine and negotiate a quick peace deal. Trump, who has previously been critical of the U.S. participation in international military alliances, including NATO, stirred controversy on Jan. 7, blaming President Joe Biden for provoking Russia&apos;s war by supporting Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations. &quot;That&#x2019;s been like written in stone. And Biden said, &apos;No, they should be able to join NATO.&apos; Then Russia has somebody right on their doorstep. I could understand their (Russia&apos;s) feelings about that,&quot; Trump said during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago. Leaders of the U.S.-led UDCG previously mulled the idea of implementing NATO control over the Ramstein format to maintain weapons supplies to Kyiv in an effort to &quot;Trump-proof&quot; the alliance. In June, NATO countries signed off on a plan for the alliance to take over control of part of the aid channel from the U.S. in coordinating military aid to Ukraine, Politico reported. Trump has not yet outlined his plans for the contact group, as the incoming president seeks to negotiate a possible ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine in exchange for reported security guarantees from Europe. &quot;I can&apos;t speak for what the incoming administration will decide about its role (within the UDCG), but I&apos;m very confident of European commitment&#x2026; ability&#x2026; experience and extraordinary belief in the mission, and (am) confident that those capability coalitions will continue one way or another,&quot; the Pentagon&apos;s news channel reported an official saying. European countries have sought to ramp up their own military spending, as well as additional support for Ukraine, amid concerns Trump will end military aid for Ukraine. Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said during a Dec. 20 briefing that several European countries are interested in deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine in an initiative led primarily by French President Emmanuel Macron. The UDCG consists of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The last Ramstein meeting on Sept. 6 was the group&apos;s 24th gathering since its establishment in April 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/upcoming-ramstein-summit-to-focus-on-supporting-ukraines-defense-capabilities-through-2027-pentagon-says-as-trump-inauguration-looms/	2025-01-07T19:55:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1252040987.jpg
Large fire reported at oil depot in Russia's Saratov Oblast following drone attack	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A large fire engulfed an oil depot overnight on Jan. 8 in the city of Engels in Saratov Oblast, various Russian Telegram media channels reported. Saratov Oblast Governor Roman Busargin said that Ukrainian drone debris struck an unspecified &quot;industrial facility&quot; around 5:30 a.m. local time. Russian Telegram channel ASTRA reported, citing resident accounts, that that an oil depot in the city had caught fire. The Kyiv Independent cannot immediately verify the claims. Videos circulating on social media appear to show a large fire burning at the oil depot, as Russian air defense attempts to down the reported drones over the city. Residents reported hearing at least five explosions ahead of the fire. 0:00/1&#xD7;Video captured by local residents of a fire reportedly caused by Ukrainian drones in the city of Engels in Russia&apos;s Saratov Oblast overnight on Jan. 8, 2025.

Engels, located over 750 kilometers away from the nearest Ukrainian-controlled border, has previously been a target of Ukrainian drone attack, with the city housing the the Engels-2 air base. Over the past year, Ukrainian forces have launched a series of drone strikes aimed at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry, which is crucial to sustain Moscow&apos;s war efforts, as well as its military hardware. As Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion continues, Ukraine has also continued to attack Russian targets along the Russia-Ukraine border to inflict damage to the country&apos;s military supply chain.	https://kyivindependent.com/large-fire-reported-in-russias-saratov-oblast-following-drone-attack/	2025-01-07T18:05:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-07_20-34-41.jpg
Chinese port ban on US-sanctioned tankers tightens oil supply, Reuters reports	Shandong Port Group has prohibited U.S.-sanctioned tankers from accessing its ports in the eastern Chinese province, three traders familiar with the issue told Reuters. This region, home to many independent refiners, is a significant importer of oil from countries under U.S. embargoes. Last year, Shandong imported approximately 1.74 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil from Iran, Russia, and Venezuela, accounting for about 17% of China&#x2019;s total imports, according to Kpler, a data and analytics company that provides real-time intelligence on commodity flows, energy markets, and maritime activities. The ban, if enforced, is expected to increase shipping costs for Shandong&#x2019;s independent refiners, which rely heavily on discounted sanctioned crude from these countries, traders told Reuters. The move follows Washington&apos;s recent expansion of sanctions on companies and tankers involved in the Iranian oil trade. President-elect Donald Trump, set to take office on Jan. 20, is anticipated to further tighten restrictions on Iran, continuing a pattern from his previous administration. Traders believe the ban could also slow oil imports into China, the world&#x2019;s largest importer of crude. A notice issued by Shandong Port on Jan. 6, verified by three traders, said that ports are prohibited from docking, unloading, or servicing vessels listed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control under the U.S. Treasury. Shandong Port manages key facilities on China&#x2019;s east coast, including Qingdao, Rizhao, and Yantai, which serve as significant hubs for importing sanctioned oil. In a follow-up notice on Jan. 7, reviewed by Reuters, Shandong Port claimed the shipping ban would have a &quot;limited impact&quot; on independent refiners, as much of the sanctioned oil arrives on non-sanctioned tankers. According to Michelle Wiese Bockmann of Lloyd&apos;s List Intelligence, the shadow fleet moving Iranian, Russian, and Venezuelan oil comprises roughly 669 tankers. Between October and December, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned 35 tankers identified as part of Iran&#x2019;s &quot;ghost fleet.&quot; Separate sanctions were also imposed on Sovcomflot, a major Russian tanker operator, early in 2024. Sources revealed that the outgoing Biden administration intends to sanction over 100 tankers linked to Russian oil, further constraining shipping options. Analysts anticipate the shift to non-sanctioned tankers will drive up costs for Shandong refiners, which are already struggling with low margins and weak demand. The sanctions are already affecting global oil prices and shipping logistics. Shares in Frontline, a leading tanker operator, surged over 9% following the port ban announcement, reflecting an anticipated tightening of tanker supply.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinese-port-ban-on-us-sanctioned-tankers-tightens-oil-supply-reuters-reports/	2025-01-07T15:15:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1822474446.jpg
Biden administration prepares final massive Ukraine aid package ahead of Trump inauguration, AP reports	The Biden administration plans to unveil a significant final weapons aid package for Ukraine during Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin&#x2019;s visit to Germany on Jan. 9. Austin is set to meet representatives from around 50 nations that have supported Ukraine since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion nearly three years ago, two senior defense officials told the Associated Press. While the officials did not specify the exact value of the aid, they described it as &quot;substantial.&quot; The package will not encompass the approximately $4 billion remaining in congressionally approved funding for Ukraine. However, they noted that &quot;more than a couple of billion dollars&quot; would likely be left for the incoming Trump administration to allocate if it chooses to do so. Ukraine is currently engaged in a second offensive targeting Russia&#x2019;s Kursk region while enduring long-range missile strikes and Russian advancements in Donetsk Oblast. Both sides are maneuvering to strengthen their negotiating positions ahead of President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on Jan. 20. According to one defense official, Biden administration officials handling Ukraine policy have been coordinating with Trump&#x2019;s transition team to address &quot;all the issues that we believe are important. &quot; Austin&#x2019;s trip to Ramstein Air Base will mark his final meeting with the coalition he formed in response to Russia&#x2019;s invasion in February 2022. Over the course of the war, these nations have contributed more than $126 billion in military assistance, including ammunition, advanced fighter jets, air defense systems, counter-UAV technologies, and tanks. The U.S. &#xA0;has provided $66 billion of that total. The upcoming aid package, scheduled to be announced on Jan. 9, will draw from existing stockpiles with the intent of delivering most of the pledged weapons to Ukraine before Trump takes office, one official said.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-administration-prepares-final-massive-ukraine-aid-package-ahead-of-trump-inauguration-ap-reports/	2025-01-07T12:51:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1494251877.jpg
Russian troops overrun Kurakhove, approach Pokrovsk east, south, and southwest	Russia keeps on advancing in eastern Donetsk Oblast, taking hold of Kurakhove, which would become the first major town to fall into Russian hands in 2025. Russian troops are continuing to push on the Lyman, Siversk, Kramatorsk, Toretsk, Pokrovsk and Kurakhove axes, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said in its latest update. Pokrovsk and Kurakhove remain the focal points of the Russian eastern offensive, now in its fifth month. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 6 that due to Ukraine&apos;s ongoing Kursk incursion, where a potential small-scale Ukrainian offensive is taking place, Russia is unable &quot;to direct all its strength&quot; to other embattled areas, including Donetsk Oblast. Yet, reports indicate that Russian troops are advancing inch by inch in an effort to capture the entire region, with little to no signs that Moscow is to slow down in the immediate future. The active phase of the battle for Kurakhove, once home to more than 18,000 people, has been ongoing since October, and the steady Russian advance in the area suggests its imminent loss. The fall of Vuhledar on Oct. 2 and the subsequent loss of Selydove on Oct. 29 meant that Kurakhove, a town squeezed in between, would turn into Russia&apos;s next main target. Russian troops entered the town in late November, and the Russian Defense Ministry claimed the full capture of Kurakhove on Jan. 6. Ukraine&apos;s military did not confirm.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)Speaking on national television, Victor Tregubov, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces, said that as of Jan. 7, weeks-long urban fighting in Kurakhove is still ongoing. &quot;There is no question of full Russian control over the town,&quot; he said. &quot;When the town is completely destroyed, there is simply no place to hold the defense because there are actually no fortifications,&quot; the spokesperson said, adding that the situation is very difficult. According to unconfirmed reports, Ukrainian troops still maintain a presence just outside the town, near the destroyed thermal power plant. Ukraine rarely admits withdrawal or loss of a settlement, preferring to say that it is contested, even when it is not. There&apos;s no evidence that Ukraine has the means to retake the town in the near future. &quot;The town has not been strategically very important, as singular towns usually aren&apos;t. They may, however, have operational or tactical relevance, and in this case, for continuing the attack in this direction, capturing Kurakhove was necessary for Russia,&quot; Emil Kastehelmi, an analyst at the Finland-based Black Bird Group, told the Kyiv Independent. The Kurakhove bulge has stretched Ukrainian defenses, and gradually retreating towards the village of Ulaky, 10 kilometers west of Kurakhove, would shorten the front line &quot;significantly,&quot; according to Kastehelmi. The highway connecting Zaporizhzhia and occupied Donetsk passes through the two settlements and serves as a major logistics chain for Ukrainian troops in and around Kurakhove. &quot;In this case, the Ukrainians can decide to give up some ground in exchange for a tighter defense, which could be useful in this case,&quot; he said. &quot;Holding onto the fields around Kurakhove for the sake of holding some ground isn&apos;t always the best idea.&quot; Meanwhile, Russian troops continue to approach Pokrovsk further northwest, gaining ground in the neighboring settlements. According to the DeepState crowdsourced map, Russian troops occupied Dachenske, Novyi Trud, Vovkove, Shevchenko, and Ivanivka &#x2014; east, south, and southwest of Pokrovsk. This would put Russian troops within a few kilometers of the city&apos;s outskirts from three sides. Ukraine still controls the main road leading to the city. The Ukrainian military has not confirmed the loss of these settlements. They cannot be independently verified at this time.

Ongoing Russian troop movements are also reported in Toretsk, which experienced a lull in active Russian advancement for a few months. In late December, the Ukrainian military said that Russia started using additional military equipment near the town. &quot;We didn&apos;t see this before, but now the enemy has become more active,&quot; said Anastasia Bobovnikova, a spokesperson of the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk. Moscow&apos;s troops were conducting assaults all over Toretsk as of Jan. 6, the DeepState claimed. The fighting is ongoing inside the city.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-overrun-kurakhove-approach-pokrovsk-from-east-south-and-southwest/	2025-01-07T12:33:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190608033.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine hits Russia's infantry brigade command post in Kursk Oblast, military claims	Key developments on Jan. 7: Ukrainian soldiers struck on Jan. 7 the command post of Russia&apos;s 810th Guards Naval Infantry Brigade near the village of Belaya in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff claimed. The report came days after Ukraine reportedly launched renewed offensive operations in Kursk Oblast, which is seen as a crucial bargaining chip for potential peace negotiations. Almost 100 Russian ground assaults were repelled in Kursk Oblast over the past day, the General Staff said. &quot;Such fire damage is an integral part of combat operations of Ukraine&apos;s Defense Forces units, which are engaged in combat operations on the territory of the Russian Federation,&quot; the statement read. No further details on the attack and the extent of the damage were disclosed. The Russian military has not commented on Ukraine&apos;s claim. Another Russian command post came under Ukraine&apos;s attack in Maryino, Kursk Oblast, on Jan. 2, according to the military. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The Russian Defense Ministry alleged on Jan. 6 that the Ukrainian advance was halted and that Ukraine&apos;s primary units were destroyed near Berdin, a settlement along a road leading northeast to the city of Kursk. Ukrainian forces launched a large-scale operation in Kursk Oblast in early August, allegedly capturing up to 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian soil. Since then, Russia has deployed reinforcements &#x2014; including North Korean soldiers &#x2014; in the area and reportedly retook around half of the lost territory. For the first time in the history of the F-16 Fighting Falcon, a Ukrainian-operated jet shot down six Russian cruise missiles during a single mission in December, including two with the aircraft cannon, the Air Force claimed on Jan. 7. The interception reportedly took place during a mass Russian aerial strike on the morning of Dec. 13, 2024, which saw Russia deploy almost 200 drones and 94 missiles. &quot;For the first time in the history of the Fighting Falcon, an F-16 fighter jet destroyed six Russian cruise missiles in one combat mission,&quot; the Air Force Command said on social media. Ukraine has received a number of U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets from the Netherlands and Denmark, deploying them multiple times in air defense roles during Russian mass strikes on cities and infrastructure. &quot;They say that even Americans couldn&apos;t believe you did it,&quot; Air Force Command spokesperson Yurii Ihnat said in an interview with the pilot, whose identity was not revealed. An undated photo of a Ukrainian pilot. (Air Force Command)The aviator said that he approached a group of cruise missiles and, despite their electronic warfare countermeasures, managed to lock on to targets. The F-16 reportedly shot down one pair of Russian projectiles with medium-range missiles and then another pair with short-range missiles. Ukrainian F-16s are equipped with four air-to-air medium-range and short-range missiles. Without missiles and low on fuel, the pilot was then recalled from the area but spotted another missile heading toward Kyiv. He moved to intercept it and opened fire from his aircraft cannon against the projectile, which was flying over 650 kilometers per hour, a difficult and risky maneuver, the Air Force said. &quot;A few bursts from the cannon &#x2014; and an explosion... then another one! &apos;A secondary detonation,&apos; I thought, but, as it turned out, there were two missiles,&quot; the pilot said, adding he did everything as taught by U.S. instructors. According to the Air Force Command, Ukrainian pilots have learned how to shoot down missiles with aircraft cannons in simulators in the U.S. but have never attempted it during actual combat before. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The F-16 Fighting Falcon entered into service in late 1978, and its various versions have been used by over two dozen countries, including the U.S. and its European allies. More than 4,600 F-16s have been built, and the platform has been deployed in multiple conflicts worldwide. During a Jan. 7 press conference, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump blamed President Joe Biden for provoking Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion by supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership aspirations. Trump argued that Ukraine&#x2019;s potential NATO membership has long been a major concern for Moscow. &quot;That&#x2019;s been like written in stone. And Biden said, &apos;No, they should be able to join NATO.&apos; Then Russia has somebody right on their doorstep. I could understand their [Russia&apos;s] feelings about that.&quot; A report by The Wall Street Journal has previously suggested that Trump&#x2019;s team was exploring a plan to delay Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for Western arms supplies and European peacekeepers to monitor a potential ceasefire with Russia. Trump also criticized Biden&#x2019;s foreign policy decisions, including the withdrawal from Afghanistan, repeating his claims that they contributed to Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s decision to launch a full-scale war against Ukraine. When asked about possible negotiations with Putin, Trump said he would wait until after his Jan. 20 inauguration to hold talks. &quot;I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s appropriate that I meet until after Jan. 20, which I hate because you know every day people are being &#x2014; many, many young people are being killed &#x2014; soldiers,&quot; he said. On Dec. 19, Putin reiterated his willingness to engage in dialogue with Trump but upheld Moscow&#x2019;s demands, including the desire to fully occupy four Ukrainian regions &#x2014; Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson &#x2014; and a rejection of Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership. Trump has pledged during the election campaign to bring a swift end to the war but has not outlined concrete steps for achieving peace. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov expressed dissatisfaction with Trump&#x2019;s reported peace deal proposals on Dec. 29, saying that Moscow rejects any plan that fails to meet its demands. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed cautious optimism about working with the incoming U.S. administration, reiterating Ukraine&#x2019;s commitment to a diplomatic resolution by 2025. Ukrainian forces continue to hold positions in the western outskirts of Kurakhove in Donetsk Oblast and a local power plant, but the situation in the town is &quot;difficult,&quot; a military spokesperson said on Jan. 7. &quot;The situation in Kurakhove is really quite difficult right now because a significant part of the city has been destroyed,&quot; Khortytsia group of forces spokesperson Viktor Trehubov said on national television on Jan. 7, only a day after Russia claimed to have full control over the town. Kurakhove has become one of the focal points of the Russian offensive in Donetsk Oblast over the past few months, turning the town into one of the hottest sectors of the front. The town lies over 20 kilometers (over 10 miles) north of Russian-occupied Vuhledar and over 30 kilometers (almost 20 miles) south of the key front-line town of Pokrovsk. &quot;Ukrainian troops are holding on the western part of the town, its western outskirts. They are also holding onto a power plant located in the town,&quot; Trehubov added. According to the spokesperson, Russian forces are attempting to raze Kurakhove building by building, destroying any potential defenses for Ukrainian soldiers. This method mirrors Russian tactics used in other front-line towns like Toretsk, where there are reportedly &quot;no intact buildings left&quot; after Moscow&apos;s onslaught. The estimated Russian advance in the Kurakhove sector of Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 6, 2025, according to the DeepState monitoring group. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)In its Jan. 7 report, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported fending off 26 Russian assaults in the Kurakhove sector, including in the area of the town itself. The DeepState monitoring group shows Kurakhove almost completely in Russian hands, save for small areas in the west. If taken, Kurakhove would be the first significant town to fall into Russian hands in 2025 after Russia took Avdiivka and Vuhledar last year. Moscow&apos;s troops now focus their efforts on Pokrovsk, an important logistics hub, as part of their overall goal to capture the entire Donetsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-jan-7/	2025-01-07T12:09:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2182865870.jpg
Believed he was making a difference' — Scottish combat medic killed in Ukraine, family says	Jordan Maclachlan, a 26-year-old volunteer and combat medic from Scotland, was killed on the front line in Ukraine on Jan. 3, BBC reported. &quot;Jordan always believed that he was making a difference, and we are all so proud of him helping others,&quot; his family said in a statement. The family is awaiting further details from the Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCDO), which confirmed to BBC it was supporting Maclachlan&apos;s family and coordinating with local authorities in Ukraine. &quot;Jordan was a fun-loving son, brother, grandson, nephew, cousin, and a friend to many and will be greatly missed by all who knew him,&quot; the family said. Maclachlan is among several British volunteers who were killed while fighting for Ukraine against Russian aggression. In November, 22-year-old Callum Tindal-Draper, who served in Ukraine&#x2019;s foreign volunteer platoon, was also killed in combat.	https://kyivindependent.com/believed-he-was-making-a-difference-scottish-combat-medic-killed-in-ukraine-family-says/	2025-01-07T11:32:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-07_19-50-45.jpg

Ukraine secures return of 3 children from Russian-occupied territories, ombudsman says	Three Ukrainian children &#x2014; a 17-year-old boy and two younger boys &#x2014; have been returned from Russian-occupied regions to Ukraine-controlled territory, Ukraine&#x2019;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets announced on Jan. 7. The 17-year-old faced persecution by Russian occupation authorities for his pro-Ukrainian stance and assistance to the Ukrainian army, according to Lubinets. &quot;He supported Ukraine under occupation and endured interrogations, threats, and intimidation from occupation representatives. Yet neither fear nor pressure broke his spirit,&quot; Lubinets said. The teenager is receiving humanitarian and financial support and preparing to continue his education in Ukraine. The two younger boys were separated from their mother, who fled Ukraine due to the war. Left in occupied Donetsk Oblast with their biological father, the boys were evacuated with the assistance of Lubinets&#x2019; office and reunited with their mother. &quot;Today, this family is safe and beginning the journey to heal the wounds of war,&quot; he said. Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, almost 20,000 Ukrainian children have been abducted by Russia, according to the Children of War database. Fewer than 400 have been returned home. Investigations by the Financial Times and The Guardian revealed systemic efforts by Russian authorities to re-educate illegally deported children and, in some cases, place them for adoption through government-linked platforms. The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, the Russian official allegedly overseeing the forced deportations of Ukrainian children to Russia, in March 2023. The ICC wrote that it believes Putin &#x201C;bears individual criminal responsibility&#x201D; as the leader of Russia for the crimes committed against Ukrainian children.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-secures-return-of-3-children-from-russian-occupied-territories-ombudsman-says/	2025-01-07T10:00:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-07_18-16-04.jpg
US sanctions Orban ally Antal Rogan for corruption, abuse of power	The U.S. Treasury Department&#x2019;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions on Jan. 7 against Antal Rogan, a senior Hungarian government official and close associate of Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Rogan is the first high-ranking Hungarian official sanctioned by the U.S. under the Magnitsky Act, which targets individuals involved in serious human rights abuses and corruption. Rogan, who serves as minister for the prime minister&#x2019;s Cabinet Office, oversees key government agencies, including the National Communications Office, the Digital Government Agency, and the Hungarian Tourism Agency. The U.S. Treasury Department accused Rogan of orchestrating schemes to control strategic sectors of Hungary&apos;s economy and diverting proceeds to himself and Fidesz party loyalists. &quot;Minister Rogan has played a central role in enabling a system in Hungary that has benefitted himself and his party at the expense of the Hungarian people,&quot; the statement said. The move comes amid growing criticism of Orban&apos;s government domestically and internationally. Hungarian opposition leader Peter Magyar called for early elections on Jan. 1, citing Orban&#x2019;s declining popularity and widespread allegations of corruption. He accused Orban of turning Hungary into &quot;the EU&apos;s poorest, most corrupt nation.&quot; The Magnitsky Act, enacted in 2012, allows the U.S. to impose visa bans and asset freezes on individuals linked to corruption or human rights violations. To date, the U.S. has sanctioned 687 individuals under the Act.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-sanctions-orban-ally-antal-rogan-for-corruption-abuse-of-power/	2025-01-07T09:38:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-sb10066698qn-001.jpg
Ukraine denies Slovakia's accusation of refusing gas transit talks	Ukraine rejected Slovakia&apos;s claims that it had refused to participate in trilateral talks with the EU and Slovakia on Russian gas transit. Slovak, Ukrainian, and European Commission representatives were scheduled to meet on Jan. 7 in Brussels to discuss the termination of the Russian gas transit through Ukrainian territory. Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko had planned to attend the Brussels discussions but was forced to stay in Kyiv due to urgent energy sector issues, Ukraine&apos;s ambassador to the EU, Vsevolod Chentsov, told Politico on Jan. 7. Kyiv proposed holding the meeting online, but the European Commission suggested rescheduling for later, Chentsov said. According to Chentsov, Ukraine initiated the meeting to address Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico&apos;s threats to halt electricity exports to Ukraine and cut support for Ukrainian refugees. &quot;Ukraine triggered the early warning mechanism on electricity supplies because of Fico&apos;s threats to stop the supplies, not gas transit talks,&quot; Chentsov said. Ukraine refused to prolong a natural gas transit agreement with Russia, which expired on Jan. 1, citing its refusal to finance Russia&apos;s war machine. Despite the EU&#x2019;s push to cut reliance on Russian fossil fuels, Slovakia remains dependent on Russian gas, bound by a long-term contract with Gazprom, Moscow&apos;s state-owned energy giant. Switching to alternative supply routes could cost Slovakia an additional 220 million euros ($229 million) in transit fees, Fico claimed. Earlier on Jan. 7, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto accused Ukraine of exacerbating Europe&apos;s economic challenges by halting Russian gas transit, leading to a 20% rise in natural gas prices on the European market. Alongside Slovakia and Austria, Hungary remains reliant on Russian gas purchased through Gazprombank, which is under Western sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-denies-refusing-gas-transit-talks-blames-slovakia-for-misinformation-ambassador-says/	2025-01-07T09:14:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1242963522.jpg
Russia ‘delusional’ about its ability to sustain Ukraine war, says Latvian foreign minister	As Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war against Ukraine nears its fourth year, a worsening battlefield situation and the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency signal that the war could soon be entering a volatile and unpredictable endgame. In anticipation of a potential Trump-negotiated ceasefire, Kyiv is looking to its partners to help put Ukraine in the best possible position, but it still remains unclear whether or not European countries will be ready to take braver steps. &#xA0; With fresh memory of Russian occupation under the Soviet Union, the Baltic States have traditionally spoken with the most clarity on Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine among NATO countries. Consistently one of the top providers of military aid to Ukraine as a percentage of GDP, Latvia has entrenched the provision of at least 0.25% worth of its GDP to Ukraine in its state budget through 2026, and was also a founding member of the drone coalition.The Kyiv Independent spoke to Latvian Foreign Minister Baiba Braze in Riga. This conversation is part of a series of interviews with decision-makers in the Nordic and Baltic countries conducted during the European screening tour of the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s documentary film Can You Hear Me? The invisible battles of Ukrainian military medics. Editor&#x2019;s note: The transcript of this interview has been edited for length and clarity. The Kyiv Independent: How have you watched this year from here, from Latvia, from just across the border with Russia, and how decisive could these next few months be? Baiba Braze: It has been a year of decisions. It has been a year of our priorities, which were very clear: making sure that all the NATO countries on Russia&apos;s borders are safe and secure, and making sure that Ukraine is supported. For us, it&apos;s not about &#x201C;for as long as it takes,&#x201D; but actually looking at Ukraine&apos;s victory, which is to be defined by Ukraine, not by others. And, of course, limiting Russia&apos;s ability to gain military capabilities, constraining Russia politically and internationally. In all three priorities, we have done a lot and achieved quite a bit of progress. The allies&apos; presence here in the Baltic states has strengthened. Sweden joined NATO, following Finland last year, so that also has meant a lot in terms of regional plans, defense plans. In terms of capabilities, we have provided what we could to Ukraine ourselves and we have really encouraged and worked with the others to do maximum. We have worked internationally to ensure that there is a lot of support for Ukraine. We have provided support for energy infrastructure. As for Russia, obviously, it moved to the war economy much faster because it&apos;s an autocratic state. So they don&apos;t have to take into account what other countries think, what the population thinks, or what various interest groups think. They literally just throw thousands of people per day to death and there is very little accountability for that in Russia. Sanctions on our side have quite clearly meant that the Russian economy is really not doing well by all accounts. We can see that in data and analysis. What they are doing is pillaging the civilian economy, taking out from the civilian side of the economy everything that they need for the military and then they are trying to avoid the sanctions that have been imposed not only by the EU but also America, U.K., and other countries in the world. In Latvia, we created a system where it&apos;s very difficult to avoid sanctions. We are responsible not only for the exports of our capabilities but also for making sure that it doesn&apos;t go to third countries that could then re-export to Russia. Other countries in the EU have to do the same. All the exports have to be checked and there has to be a due diligence system for sanctions making sure that their exports don&apos;t reach countries in Central Asia and then go to Russia. That has not yet happened. That is, I think, for the next year, a very important objective to make sure that all the EU countries, all European countries have a due diligence system on sanctions in place. Plus, maintaining the pressure on the Russian economy, supplying Ukraine, and making sure that NATO is strong and united.

(Aleksander Kalka/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Working with the new U.S. administration is crucially important. But, on the battlefield, Ukraine is heroic. We speak to various institutions in Ukraine and I think it&apos;s crucially important to hold together and maintain this winter. For Russia, it&apos;s just getting more difficult. That&apos;s why they&apos;re so desperately trying to take some villages now. And, from the Nordic-Baltic side, we will continue supplying what we can, what we have, and we will encourage others to do that. I think that nobody wants Ukraine to be left alone in terms of aid or support. There&apos;s solidarity, there&apos;s everything. So, just be strong and know that you have so many friends and allies. That also concerns the wider future of Ukraine. You want to be in the EU and NATO. That is, of course, a guiding star for everything that Ukrainians do for the internal reforms, such as anti-corruption, and justice, which is as important. Because, in the end, Ukrainian people want peace, stability, security, prosperity, just like everybody else. The Kyiv Independent: Since the U.S. elections, the topic of peace negotiations has come up more and more recently, and President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Ukraine would be ready to end the fighting from their side without liberating all of its sovereign territory in exchange for NATO membership. Does Latvia share this opinion, is that the line that is taken in international discussions, or do you think there could be another alternative for a hard deterrence? Baiba Braze: The future of Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO is decided. There was a political decision, both in 2008 and at last year&apos;s Washington summit, that Ukraine&apos;s future in NATO is something that is not negotiable. But on the other hand, of course, with a war ongoing, what does it mean then to have security guarantees? What does it mean to be a member of NATO? Currently, NATO is not ready to enter the war, because the clear concept is that Ukraine&apos;s self-defense is supported, everybody supports it and provides what is necessary, but nobody wants to be part of the war, fighting the war. That&apos;s why there&#x2019;s a question of the borders, which borders, if the ceasefire applies or if there is a sort of stop in hostilities, then the questions about security guarantees or Article 5. None of these concepts are abstract, and I don&apos;t think people will be ready to discuss that much in public. I agree with President Zelensky that NATO membership is the best way for Ukraine, we support it, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s an exchange for ceasefire or exchange for peace talks versus NATO membership. The Kyiv Independent: Do you think it&apos;s possible in the near term to reach this unified understanding that peace must come with a secure Ukraine, or can it be solved afterward? Baiba Bra&#x17E;e: The understanding is there because nobody wants some ceasefire which just lets Russia reconstitute and then start more of the war. That&apos;s in nobody&apos;s interest. But the stronger Ukraine is on the battlefield, the stronger the position at the negotiation table. So that is a primary precondition of successful negotiations. It will also be very difficult if there is some type of settlement because we know from our experience that getting Russian troops out is very difficult. Nobody will recognize occupied territories as Russian. International law and Ukrainian international borders are what they are. It was the same with the Baltic states. We were occupied by the Soviets for 50 years, but neither the U.S. nor other Western countries recognized the occupation. We restored our independence, even though many people were saying, &#x201C;Oh, that&apos;s not possible, that&apos;s not going to happen, how can you think of a full regaining of independence?&#x201D; An aerial view of the graves of Ukrainian soldiers who died during the Ukraine-Russia War in the 18th cemetery in Kharkiv, Ukraine on May 21, 2024. (Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)Primarily, we as people &#x2013; whether it&apos;s Latvians, Estonians or Lithuanians &#x2013; know what we want. We make our choices, and Ukraine is the same. Ukraine knows what it wants, and it makes its choices. And yes, fighting for the freedom and for the future, which is the future of a free country, is very difficult, and the losses and the situation on the battlefield are very difficult, but it&apos;s worth fighting for, in my view. The Kyiv Independent: Despite Russia&#x2019;s problems, Moscow keeps saying that they are against a freezing of the conflict under any circumstances. Maybe they see some kind of victory in their sights. How do you interpret that? Baiba Braze: I think it&apos;s, on one hand, delusional, ignoring the reality of the economy, of the real situation in Russia, and thinking that they can maintain this. On the other hand, it also shows their conviction that they have to take as much territory as soon as possible because that will make their position stronger. That&apos;s why we need to make sure that you are as strong as necessary, fighting for Ukraine&apos;s future, and showing the Russians that Ukrainians are not going to give up the fight. All those elements are as important, and of course, a very clear stance by the U.S. and by the Europeans and other powers in the world on saying that support for Ukraine will continue. Everybody has said that. And that is a powerful message and stance to the Kremlin that you might think that by taking a few villages you are winning, but your economy and the situation within Russia are showing something different, and Ukraine will continue to be supported. But again, the will of the Ukrainian people is the first precondition. It&apos;s crucially important to continue showing that there is a will to fight, to be free, to become members of the EU and NATO because nobody else is going to do that for you. Others will support it, but it&apos;s a Ukrainian fight. The Kyiv Independent: When it comes to establishing a real hard deterrence against a repeat invasion, if it&apos;s not NATO membership itself, more and more people have been talking about so-called boots on the ground, a physical presence of troops from NATO countries or even non-NATO partners inside Ukraine. Do you think that physical presence is required? Baiba Braze: I cannot discuss what is being discussed in classified conversations &#x2013; it would be highly irresponsible of me. Latvia hasn&apos;t made any decisions because it&apos;s not a decision-making time. If there is at some moment the ceasefire or the settlement that Ukraine is satisfied with, that there is a very clear understanding of how to enforce it, together with allies, I would imagine Latvia is not going to say no. But again, I don&apos;t have a mandate to say that currently because we are not there yet. So that would be highly irresponsible to sort of suggest something. But the sort of very strong message that we transmit to everyone and that we as Nordic-Baltic countries discuss and stand for is Ukraine first, that Ukraine&apos;s strength, Ukraine&apos;s supply is a battle. The political support, the future in the EU and NATO is something that we are devoting all that we can to in terms of political support, money, and resources. But without Ukraine&apos;s leadership, without Ukraine&apos;s will, without Ukraine&apos;s standing for itself, nobody is going to replace that. So that is the first sort of leading light that we all look up to.	https://kyivindependent.com/its-a-ukrainian-fight-latvian-foreign-minister-on-the-road-to-a-just-peace-in-russias-war/	2025-01-07T08:35:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2150161479.jpg
Hungary's FM criticizes Ukraine for gas transit halt, claims 20% rise in gas prices	Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto accused Ukraine of exacerbating Europe&apos;s economic challenges by halting Russian gas transit, leading to a 20% rise in natural gas prices on the European market, in a post published on Facebook on Jan. 7. Ukraine refused to prolong an agreement with Russia on Russian natural gas transit through its territory that expired on Jan. 1, citing its refusal to finance Russia&#x2019;s war. While the EU has worked to reduce reliance on Russian fossil fuels, countries like Hungary and Slovakia remain dependent on Russian gas. Szijjarto criticized Ukraine&#x2019;s actions, claiming they put the European economy, particularly Central Europe, in a difficult position. &quot;Although Ukraine is trying to join the EU as a candidate for membership, with its latest decision, it has once again put the European economy in a difficult situation,&quot; he said. He also claimed that Hungary has diversified its energy sources and will not be significantly affected by rising prices. Hungary annually imports approximately 4.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas under a 15-year agreement signed in 2021. Alongside Slovakia and Austria, Hungary remains reliant on Russian gas purchased through Gazprombank, which is under Western sanctions. Szijjarto said he had met with Slovak Foreign Minister Juraj Blanar to analyze the situation and emphasized that Ukraine must uphold its EU association agreement, which includes commitments to maintain energy transportation routes. Slovak, Ukrainian, and European Commission representatives were scheduled to meet on Jan. 7 in Brussels to discuss the transit shutdown. However, the meeting was canceled. While Slovakia claimed that Ukraine refused to participate, Kyiv refuted the claim. Since Ukraine&apos;s energy minister was forced to stay in Ukraine due to the &quot;difficult situation in the energy sector,&quot; he suggested holding the discussions online, Kyiv said. &#xA0;The European Commission said it was working to reschedule the talks and affirmed that the EU energy market remains stable despite the transit halt. Hungary, seen as the EU&#x2019;s most Moscow-friendly member, has repeatedly blocked sanctions against Russia and aid to Ukraine. Szijjarto has continued to visit Russia throughout the war, setting Hungary apart from other EU nations.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungarys-fm-criticizes-ukraine-for-gas-transit-halt-claims-economic-harm/	2025-01-07T07:40:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2155704049.jpg
Ukraine hits Russia's infantry brigade command post in Kursk Oblast, military claims	Ukrainian soldiers struck on Jan. 7 the command post of Russia&apos;s 810th Guards Naval Infantry Brigade near the village of Belaya in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff claimed. The report came days after Ukraine reportedly launched renewed offensive operations in Kursk Oblast, which is seen as a crucial bargaining chip for potential peace negotiations. Almost 100 Russian ground assaults were repelled in Kursk Oblast over the past day, the General Staff said. &quot;Such fire damage is an integral part of combat operations of Ukraine&apos;s Defense Forces units, which are engaged in combat operations on the territory of the Russian Federation,&quot; the statement read. No further details on the attack and the extent of the damage were disclosed. The Russian military has not commented on Ukraine&apos;s claim. Another Russian command post came under Ukraine&apos;s attack in Maryino, Kursk Oblast, on Jan. 2, according to the military. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The Russian Defense Ministry alleged on Jan. 6 that the Ukrainian advance was halted and that Ukraine&apos;s primary units were destroyed near Berdin, a settlement along a road leading northeast to the city of Kursk. Ukrainian forces launched a large-scale operation in Kursk Oblast in early August, allegedly capturing up to 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian soil. Since then, Russia has deployed reinforcements &#x2014; including North Korean soldiers &#x2014; in the area and reportedly retook around half of the lost territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hits-russias-infantry-brigade-command-post-in-kursk-oblast-military-claims/	2025-01-07T06:54:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2182865870.jpg
Ukraine's military refutes claims of Russia taking Kharkiv Oblast village	A military spokesperson on Jan. 7 denied reports of Russia taking the village of Lozova in Kharkiv Oblast, saying there had not even been any &quot;serious clashes&quot; in the area at the time. Located in Ukraine&apos;s northeast, Lozova lies near the administrative borders with Luhansk Oblast and around 30 kilometers (20 miles) southwest of the front-line town of Kupiansk. The crowdsourced war-monitoring DeepState map showed that the Russian military recently took the village. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. &quot;It&apos;s hard for me to determine where the information about its capture came from. The information (coming in) from that place is contradictory. There is not even information about serious clashes there as of now,&quot; Khortytsia group of forces spokesperson Viktor Trehubov said on national television. DeepState is an independent mapping project with close ties to the Defense Ministry. It is widely trusted as one of the most reliable sources of accurate information on territorial changes along the front line. As Ukraine ended 2024 with an unsolved manpower shortage and setbacks in several key battles, Russian units are gaining ground incrementally in Ukraine&apos;s east.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-military-refutes-claims-of-russia-taking-kharkiv-oblast-village/	2025-01-07T06:01:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1749127943.jpg
Ukraine says it holds Kurakhove's western outskirts despite Russia's claim of capture	Ukrainian forces continue to hold positions in the western outskirts of Kurakhove in Donetsk Oblast and a local power plant, but the situation in the town is &quot;difficult,&quot; a military spokesperson said on Jan. 7. &quot;The situation in Kurakhove is really quite difficult right now, because a significant part of the city has been destroyed,&quot; Khortytsia group of forces spokesperson Viktor Trehubov said on national television on Jan. 7, only a day after Russia claimed to have full control over the town. Kurakhove has become one of the focal points of the Russian offensive in Donetsk Oblast over the past few months, turning the town into one of the hottest sectors of the front. The town lies over 20 kilometers (over 10 miles) north of Russian-occupied Vuhledar and over 30 kilometers (almost 20 miles) south of the key front-line town of Pokrovsk. &quot;Ukrainian troops are holding on the western part of the town, its western outskirts. They are also holding onto a power plant located in the town,&quot; Trehubov added. According to the spokesperson, Russian forces are attempting to raze Kurakhove building by building, destroying any potential defenses for Ukrainian soldiers. This method mirrors Russian tactics used in other front-line towns like Toretsk, where there are reportedly &quot;no intact buildings left&quot; after Moscow&apos;s onslaught. In its Jan. 7 report, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported fending off 26 Russian assaults in the Kurakhove sector, including in the area of the town itself. The DeepState monitoring group shows Kurakhove almost completely in Russian hands, save for small areas in the west. If taken, Kurakhove would be the first significant town to fall into Russian hands in 2025 after Russia took Avdiivka and Vuhledar last year. Moscow&apos;s troops now focus their efforts at Pokrovsk, an important logistics hub, as part of their overall goal to capture the entire Donetsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-says-it-holds-kurakhoves-western-outskirts-despite-russias-claim-of-capture/	2025-01-07T05:41:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2172110304.jpg
Northern European coalition steps up undersea monitoring amid sabotage, Russian shadow fleet concerns	The U.K-led Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) has set up a tracking system to alert allies if a ship poses a threat to undersea cable infrastructure and to monitor Russia&apos;s shadow fleet of tankers, London said on Jan. 7. The JEF is a coalition of 10 northern European NATO countries. The decision comes after several telecommunication and energy cables underneath the Baltic Sea were damaged over the past six months, with four telecom cables and one power cable severed on Dec. 25. Only two of those cables of the Christmas incident were repaired by Jan. 7. Authorities suspect the Russian shadow vessel Eagle S of the sabotage. The new Nordic Warden system monitors ships in real-time and alerts JEF and NATO allies if a vessel behaves suspiciously. Its database also contains tankers that are part of Russia&#x2019;s shadow fleet. The shadow fleet refers to a group of aging, poorly insured tankers Russia uses to avoid international sanctions on its oil trade. Moscow also uses these vessels for espionage, Sweden said. &quot;Nordic Warden will help protect against both deliberate acts of sabotage as well as cases of extreme negligence which we have seen cause damage to underwater cables,&quot; U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said in a statement. Parallel to the Nordic Warden operation, NATO is increasing its military presence in the Baltic Sea to bolster situational awareness and deter potential threats. Allies are also exploring measures to protect critical undersea infrastructure, supported by NATO&apos;s Maritime Centre for Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure, established in May. Allied officials have raised alarm over a growing number of Russian sabotage operations in Europe since the West threw its support behind Kyiv after the outbreak of the full-scale invasion in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-led-coalition-steps-up-undersea-monitoring/	2025-01-07T05:04:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1238924684--1-.jpg
Ukrainians' trust in Zelensky dropped to 52% during 2024, poll shows	Some 52% of Ukrainians trust President Volodymyr Zelensky, a drop of seven percentage points from October 2024 and 12 points from February, according to a survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published on Jan. 7. In turn, 39% of respondents said they trust the president. The poll, conducted between Dec. 2 and 17 last year, comes as Russia&apos;s all-out war nears its third anniversary while Moscow&apos;s troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. Trust in Zelensky, dealing with growing unpopularity before February 2022, skyrocketed after Russia launched its full-scale invasion and the president remained in Kyiv to lead the country&apos;s resistance, earlier KIIS surveys showed. The figures began to drop in 2024 as the battlefield stalemate gave way to Russian tactical advances, though most Ukrainians maintained their trust in Zelensky throughout the year. Zelensky is seen more favorably in the western (60%) and central (52%) regions of the country and less so in the southern (46%) and eastern (42%) regions. Ukraine&apos;s south and east have been the most affected by Russia&apos;s war. The survey&apos;s results were based on telephone interviews with 2,000 respondents residing in Ukraine-controlled territories. Other recent sociological surveys point to moderate but consistent growth of pessimism among the Ukrainian population toward the war&apos;s progress. In another KIIS survey from December 2024, around 38% of respondents said they were open to territorial concessions in exchange for peace, a notable increase from 19% a year earlier. Expectations of possible peace talks in 2025 are mounting as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-trust-in-zelensky-mildly-drops-to-52-poll-shows/	2025-01-07T04:41:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190061070.jpg
Russian Patriarch Kirill bashes West during Orthodox Christmas celebrations	Moscow Patriarch Kirill accused the West of &quot;hating&quot; Russia because it represents &quot;an alternative path of civilizational development.&quot; He made the comments during the celebration of the Christmas Mass on Jan. 7. Patriarch Kirill (born Vladimir Gundyayev) has been a close ally of Putin, praising his rule as a &quot;gift from God&quot; and publicly supporting the war against Ukraine, subsequently straining relations with other Orthodox churches. &quot;We are hated (by the West) because we offer a different path, an alternative path of civilizational development,&quot; the head of the Russian Orthodox Church told the faithful during his sermon. Orthodox Christians in Russia celebrate Christmas on Jan. 7 in accordance with the Julian calendar. In 2023, Ukraine signed a law moving the day of Christmas celebrations to Dec. 25, similar to Western Christianity. During the mass, Kirill blessed icons and crosses that were engraved with Putin&apos;s initials and will be sent to Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Russian media. &quot;Physically, they cannot really smother us, though they try through different types of slander and the creation of blocs of some sort intended to weaken Russia,&quot; Kirill said, according to Reuters. The Russian religious leader often bashes the West for what he presents as &quot;moral decadence,&quot; primarily attacking LGBTQ rights that are increasingly suppressed in Russia. Ukraine placed Kirill on its wanted list in December 2023 after accusing him of infringing on Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity resulting in &quot;the death of people or other serious consequences.&quot; The charge carries a punishment of life imprisonment. Last August, the Ukrainian parliament passed a bill banning activities of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate, which has been linked to the Russian church, and many of its members have been accused of collaboration or sympathies with Russia. Most Ukrainian Orthodox Christians adhere to a separate and autonomous Orthodox Church of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-head-of-church-bashes-west-during-orthodox-christmas-celebrations/	2025-01-07T04:02:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1240189228.jpg
In historic record, Ukrainian F-16 pilot downs 6 cruise missiles in single mission, Air Force claims	For the first time in the history of the F-16 Fighting Falcon, a Ukrainian-operated jet shot down six Russian cruise missiles during a single mission in December, including two with the aircraft cannon, the Air Force claimed on Jan. 7. The interception reportedly took place during a mass Russian aerial strike on the morning of Dec. 13, 2024, which saw Russia deploy almost 200 drones and 94 missiles. &quot;For the first time in the history of the Fighting Falcon, an F-16 fighter jet destroyed six Russian cruise missiles in one combat mission,&quot; the Air Force Command said on social media. Ukraine has received a number of U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets from the Netherlands and Denmark, deploying them multiple times in air defense roles during Russian mass strikes on cities and infrastructure. &quot;They say that even Americans couldn&apos;t believe you did it,&quot; Air Force Command spokesperson Yurii Ihnat said in an interview with the pilot, whose identity was not revealed. The aviator said that he approached a group of cruise missiles and, despite their electronic warfare countermeasures, managed to lock on to targets. The F-16 reportedly shot down one pair of Russian projectiles with medium-range missiles and then another pair with short-range missiles. An undated photo of a Ukrainian pilot published by the Air Force Command.Ukrainian F-16s are equipped with four air-to-air medium-range and short-range missiles. Without missiles and low on fuel, the pilot was then recalled from the area but spotted another missile heading toward Kyiv. He moved to intercept it and opened fire from his aircraft cannon against the projectile, which was flying over 650 kilometers per hour, a difficult and risky maneuver, the Air Force said. &quot;A few bursts from the cannon &#x2014; and an explosion... then another one! &apos;A secondary detonation,&apos; I thought, but, as it turned out, there were two missiles,&quot; the pilot said, adding he did everything as taught by U.S. instructors. According to the Air Force Command, Ukrainian pilots have learned how to shoot down missiles with aircraft cannons in simulators in the U.S. but have never attempted it during actual combat before. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The F-16 Fighting Falcon entered into service in late 1978, and its various versions have been used by over two dozen countries, including the U.S. and its European allies. More than 4,600 F-16s have been built, and the platform has been deployed in multiple conflicts worldwide.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-f-16-pilot-downs-6-cruise-missiles/	2025-01-07T03:16:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2165218520.jpg
FPV drones launched from naval drone struck Russian air defenses for first time, Ukraine says	For the first time, Ukrainian first-person-view (FPV) drones using a naval drone as a springboard took out three Russian air defense systems, Ukraine&#x2019;s Centre for Strategic Communication and Information Security said on Jan. 7. &quot;Only a week after Ukrainian sea drones made history by successfully taking down Russian helicopters, another historical first as our homegrown naval drones are now launching their own FPV drones, destroying Russia&apos;s air defense units,&quot; the government agency said on social media. As a result of the attack on Jan. 6, two Russian anti-missile Pantsir-S1 systems and one OSA anti-aircraft vehicle were reportedly damaged or destroyed in the occupied part of Ukraine&apos;s southern Kherson Oblast. The strikes were carried out by Ukraine&apos;s Navy, which released a video of the attack against one of the Pantsir systems. The Kyiv Independent could not establish the extent of damage dealt to Russian air defenses. A Pantsir S-1 has an estimated price tag of around $15 million. One such system is suspected to be behind the mistaken downing of an Azerbaijani plane on Dec. 25, according to the media. The attack came a week after Ukrainian Magura V5 naval drones hit three Russian Mi-8 helicopters, downing two of them over the Black Sea in another strike that was also the first of its kind. President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a decree in February ordering the creation of a separate branch of the Armed Forces for drones, called Unmanned Systems Forces, to command the rapidly evolving drone warfare in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. Cheaper to operate and more precise than most artillery systems, drones quickly became one of the main tools for Ukraine to fend off Russia&#x2019;s assaults amid chronic artillery ammunition shortages.	https://kyivindependent.com/fpv-drones-launched-from-naval-drone-struck-russian-air-defenses-for-first-time-ukraine-says/	2025-01-07T02:12:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1957348817.jpg
Europe might soon feel ‘intense pressure’ to strike a deal with Moscow, Polish FM warns	Europe might soon feel &quot;intense pressure&quot; to reach some sort of an agreement with Russia regarding its war against Ukraine, Poland&#x2019;s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said in a post on X on Jan. 6. His words came only two weeks before the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged to quickly bring an end to the war but has not provided details on how he plans to do it. &quot;We could soon face intense pressure to strike a deal with Moscow,&quot; Sikorski wrote after delivering a speech for French ambassadors in Paris. &quot;But what kind of deal would a sensible Europe accept? Certainly not an ordinary deal that would allow Moscow to regain its strength. Europe is much stronger than Russian leaders believe. Russia is much weaker than many Europeans believe,&quot; he added. Despite mounting economic challenges at home, Russian leaders have shown little interest in a peace deal and rejected reported proposals from Trump&apos;s team. Moscow&apos;s troops currently hold the upper hand on the battlefield, advancing in Donetsk Oblast and chipping away at Ukraine&apos;s positions in Kursk Oblast. &quot;Ukraine deserves peace, needs peace. But it should be peace on fair terms, not capitulation,&quot; the Polish foreign minister wrote, adding that Europe should help position Kyiv to be in the best possible shape ahead of entering negotiations with Moscow. Zelensky recently said that Ukraine must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means in 2025, noting that the war would &quot;end faster&quot; under a Trump administration. French President Emmanuel Macron recently said that Ukraine should prepare for &quot;realistic&quot; discussions on territory, warning there will not be a &quot;quick and easy solution&quot; to the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-might-soon-feel-intense-pressure-to-strike-a-deal-with-moscow-polish-fm-warns/	2025-01-07T01:40:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GgoOthOXkAAR2TH.jpeg
Ukrainian forces in Kursk Oblast fend off almost 100 Russian assaults in a day, military says	Ukrainian forces repelled 94 Russian ground assaults in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast over the past day, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 7 amid escalating hostilities in the region. This represents nearly half of the skirmishes over the past day, as the military reported 218 clashes across the front. On Jan. 5, Ukraine launched renewed offensive operations in the Russian region, which is seen as crucial for any possible peace negotiations. The Russian Defense Ministry alleged on Jan. 6 that the Ukrainian advance was halted and that Ukraine&apos;s primary units were destroyed near Berdin, a settlement along a road leading northeast to the city of Kursk. Ukraine has not commented on the claims and provided limited information on the operation. The U.S.-based think tank Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said that between Jan. 5 and 6, Ukrainian forces advanced in southern Berdin, central Russkoye Porechnoye, and central Novosotnitsky, all northeast of Sudzha, a key Ukraine-held town in the region. The ISW analysts speculated that these attacks &quot;may be the beginning stages of a concerted Ukrainian operation in Kursk Oblast or elsewhere in the theater.&quot; In the meantime, Russian forces took advantage of Ukrainian activity to attack elsewhere in the Kursk Oblast salient, apparently advancing west of Malaya Loknya, according to the ISW. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Ukrainian forces launched a large-scale operation in Kursk Oblast in early August, allegedly capturing up to 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian soil. Since then, Russia has deployed reinforcements &#x2014; including North Korean soldiers &#x2014; in the area and reportedly retook around half of the lost territory. Outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Jan. 6 that Ukrainian positions in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast could play an important role in possible talks with Russia. Prospects of negotiations in 2025 are hotly discussed amid U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s pledges to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-fends-off-almost-100-russian-assaults-in-kursk-oblast-military-reports/	2025-01-07T01:12:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2174856030.jpg
Umerov appoints ex-Infrastructure Minister Kubrakov as his advisor to tackle logistics	Defense Minister Rustem Umerov has appointed former Vice Prime Minister and Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov as his advisor &quot;on a voluntary basis,&quot; Umerov announced on Jan. 7. Kubrakov had headed the Infrastructure Ministry since May 2021 before being dismissed in May 2024 for unclear reasons. While his dismissal was formally justified by the restructuring of Kubrakov&apos;s ministry, Ukrainska Pravda reported that the former minister fell out of favor with the Presidential Office. The ex-minister&apos;s &quot;experience as the deputy prime minister, the infrastructure minister, and head of Ukravtodor (the State Agency of Automobile Roads) is important and will help improve the supply and logistics in the Armed Forces,&quot; Umerov said on the Defense Ministry&apos;s Telegram channel. The appointment comes amid wide-ranging calls for military reforms as Ukraine&apos;s army is increasingly on the back foot in its war against Russia. Last week, Umerov announced a comprehensive review of the Ground Forces Command to evaluate management structures, processes, and compliance with legislation to support reforms and enhance battlefield effectiveness.	https://kyivindependent.com/umerov-appoints-kubrakov-as-his-advisor/	2025-01-07T00:33:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/kubrakov.jpg
Putin sends trusted general to fend off Ukraine’s offensive in Kursk	Russia sent one of its top generals, General Yunus-Bek Yevkurov, to organize Russia&#x2019;s defense in Kursk Oblast against a renewed Ukrainian attack, The Telegraph reported on Jan. 5. Ukrainian troops recently launched a renewed offensive against Russian forces in Kursk Oblast in an apparent attempt to halt Moscow&#x2019;s effort to retake the region before Donald Trump takes office and possible negotiations begin. The Russian Defense Ministry alleged on Jan. 6 that Ukrainian forces were stopped, and their primary units were destroyed near Berdin, a settlement along a road leading northeast to the city of Kursk. Ukraine has not commented on the claims and provided limited information on the operation. General Yunus-Bek Yevkurov has been serving as the Kremlin&#x2019;s deputy defense minister and was tasked to head Russia&#x2019;s border defenses and lead Moscow&#x2019;s mercenary projects in Africa. According to the Telegraph, he was sent to Kursk Oblast &quot;hours&quot; after Ukraine began its maneuvers on Jan. 5. The general also survived an assassination attempt with life-threatening injuries while serving as the Kremlin-backed president of Ingushetia, one of Russia&apos;s most unstable regions. Ukrainian troops made a surprise incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, capturing about 1,300 square kilometers of territory as a potential bargaining chip in future negotiations with Russia. Although Kyiv has since lost control of half of the initially seized area, fighting in the region remains intense.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-sends-trusted-general-to-fend-off-ukraines-offensive-in-kursk/	2025-01-07T00:10:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1242524435-1.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 3, injure 23 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least three civilians and injured at least 23 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 7. Russia launched 38 Shahed-type attack drones and various dummy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Twenty-eight drones were shot down, and 10 were lost in the airspace, according to the statement. In Donetsk Oblast, one person was killed and another injured during a Russian attack against the town of Siversk, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Two civilians were also injured in Rivne in the Pokrovsk district and one in Rodynske, according to the governor. A 61-year-old woman was injured during a Russian attack against the village of Zolochiv in Kharkiv Oblast, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. In Kherson Oblast, two people were killed and 17 injured in Russian attacks, said the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. This included a 50-year-old man killed and at least five women aged between 30 and 58 injured when a Russian drone dropped explosives on a bus in Kherson. One civilian suffered injuries during a Russian rocket attack against the Bilopillia community in Sumy Oblast, the regional military administration reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-115/	2025-01-06T23:35:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-07_08-42-12.jpg
Russian forces attempt to 'infiltrate' settlements around Pokrovsk, Ukraine's military says	Small Russian units are attempting to advance around Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, but the town itself is not threatened at the moment, a Ukrainian military spokesperson said on Jan. 6. Russia has been focusing its efforts on Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub in the region, advancing within only a few kilometers south of the town as civilian residents flee. &quot;The Pokrovsk sector has been one of the hottest parts of the front for the last four weeks, maybe longer,&quot; Khortytsia group of forces spokesperson Viktor Trehubov said on national television. &quot;But they (Russian forces) are currently unable to achieve such a success as to threaten Porkovsk itself.&quot; Trehubov claimed that Moscow&apos;s troops are unable to take the town &quot;in pincers&quot; but are attempting to &quot;infiltrate&quot; surrounding settlements. The estimated Russian advance near Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 6, 2025, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Russian units are &quot;trying to bypass (Pokrovsk) in one way or another, clinging to individual houses in individual settlements,&quot; the spokesperson said. The DeepState monitoring group shows Russian forces less than 3 kilometers (less than 2 miles) south of the town and largely in control of several nearby settlements like Svehchenko and Dachenske. Moscow&apos;s troops appear to be advancing not only directly from the south but also from the southwest through Pishchane and from the southeast from the direction of Mykolaivka. Several Ukrainian positions in the surrounding settlements have been destroyed by Russian fire and advances, and Kyiv&apos;s forces are &quot;taking measures to prevent the deterioration of the situation,&quot; the Khortytsia group said on Telegram on Jan. 7. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Russia has advanced swiftly in Donetsk Oblast in late 2024. After capturing Vuhledar last October, Russia claimed on Jan. 6 that its forces had taken Kurakhove. Fighting is also ongoing within the towns of Chasiv Yar and Toretsk. Ukraine finds itself increasingly on the back foot as its military faces manpower shortages. The battlefield situation is likely to play a crucial role in the year to come amid U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s calls for peace talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-attempt-to-infiltrate-settlements-around-pokrovsk-ukraines-military-says/	2025-01-06T23:03:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2184405015.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 800,010 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 800,010 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 7. This number includes 1,970 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,710 tanks, 20,189 armored fighting vehicles, 33,226 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,710 artillery systems, 1,260 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,038 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 21,708 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-800-010-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-06T22:25:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/1_Petrasiuk_1.JPG
French official confirms 'dozens' of Ukrainian soldiers deserted while training in France, AFP reports	A French army official confirmed to AFP on Jan. 6 that several dozen Ukrainian soldiers serving in the 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Mechanized Brigade deserted while undergoing military training in France. &quot;There have been a certain number of desertions, but they remain very marginal given the volume of people who have undergone training,&quot; the unnamed official told AFP. &quot;They were in French barracks, they had the right to go out,&quot; the added. The brigade is a flagship project under which Kyiv&apos;s partners will help train new Ukrainian military formations and provide heavy equipment. The unit has about 5,800 troops, fewer than 2,000 of whom have undergone training in France. The brigade has become plagued with controversy after media reports emerged of desertion and widespread mismanagement in recent days. A media investigation conducted by Ukrainian publication Censor.net claimed that soldiers of the unit, now deployed near Pokrovsk, have suffered losses and went AWOL (absent without leave) in large numbers due to poor command and organization on Ukraine&apos;s side. Yurii Butusov, the publication&apos;s chief editor, claimed about 50 deserted in France, in addition to hundreds who left their posts even before the unit was deployed at the front. Between March and November, over 1,700 soldiers had gone AWOL, Butusov claimed without providing evidence. Though the unit was replenished with new recruits, these often did not undergo &quot;proper selection process,&quot; the journalist added. Mykhailo Drapatyi, commander of Ukraine&#x2019;s Ground Forces, acknowledged significant challenges within the French-trained brigade, including high desertion rates and poor organization in a press conference on Jan. 6. &quot;There are problems, and there were problems in staffing, training, and partially in the command staff,&quot; Drapatyi said. &quot;This is all consciously analyzed, and certain conclusions have been drawn.&quot; Following the emergence of media reports, Ukraine&apos;s State Bureau of Investigation on Jan. 2 launched a probe into suspected desertion and abuse of authority. On Jan. 5, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi ordered to boost the brigade with drones amid the reports. The report comes amid growing calls for reform within Ukraine&#x2019;s military leadership as Kyiv grapples with intensifying pressure in its war with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/french-official-confirms-dozens-of-ukrainian-soldiers-deserted-while-training-in-france-afp-reports/	2025-01-06T20:24:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1246365005-m-1674723833vz7l2.jpeg
Incoming Ukraine peace envoy postpones visit to Kyiv until after Trump's inauguration, Reuters reports	The Trump administration&apos;s Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, has postponed a visit to Kyiv until after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20, Reuters reported on Jan. 6, citing four sources with knowledge of the trip. According to the sources who spoke to Reuters, the new date has not yet been set, and it was not immediately clear as to why the trip was postponed. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously confirmed to journalists in Brussels on Dec. 19 that Kellogg would visit Ukraine before Trump&apos;s inauguration in January, according to a Kyiv Independent reporter. Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said on Dec. 20 that Ukraine and the U.S. had initially reached a preliminary agreement on the date of a visit to Kyiv by Kellogg &#x2014; although that date was never publicly revealed. Reuters reported on Dec. 18 that Kellogg planned to visit Kyiv and several European capitals before Trump takes office on Jan. 20 as part of the new administration&#x2019;s effort to address Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Sources confirmed on Jan. 6 that Kellogg remains committed to visiting other European capitals, including Rome and Paris. Kellogg, a former national security advisor to Vice President Mike Pence, is a known figure to Ukraine and &quot;has maintained close ties... in recent years&quot; with Kyiv, Tykhyi said on Nov. 28. Trump has pledged to quickly bring an end to the war but has not provided details on how he plans to do it. Zelensky recently said that the country must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means in 2025, adding that a war would &quot;end faster&quot; under a Trump administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-ukraine-peace-envoy-postpones-visit-to-kyiv-until-after-inauguration-reuters-reports/	2025-01-06T19:17:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1228656063.jpg
Head of Ukraine's Customs Service suspected of failing to declare over $100,000 in assets	Law enforcement agents are investigating Serhiy Zvyagintsev, the interim head of Ukraine&apos;s State Customs Service, over suspicions that Zvyagintsev failed to declare a home near Kyiv, that has been evaluated to be worth over $100,000, the country&apos;s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) said on Jan. 6. Investigators believe that Zvyagintsev and his family are the actual owners of a 236 square meter home, as well as an adjacent plot of land, on the outskirts of Kyiv that is registered under Zvyagintsev&apos;s father-in-law. Investigators allege that Zvyagintsev failed to declare the assets between 2021 and 2023. The system of compulsory asset declarations was originally instituted as part of the country&apos;s fight against corruption following the 2013-2014 EuroMaidan Revolution. At the start of the full-scale Russian invasion, the requirement for submitting e-declarations was suspended. President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a law in October 2023 to resume asset declarations for officials and immediately make them publicly accessible. Ukraine&apos;s National Agency on Corruption Prevention (NACP) re-opened access to the asset declaration system in December 2023. An investigation, conducted by NABU as well as the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&#x2019;s Office (SAPO) is ongoing as Zvyagintsev faces charges under Ukraine&apos;s Criminal Code.	https://kyivindependent.com/head-of-ukraines-customs-service-suspected-of-failing-to-declare-over-100-000-in-assets/	2025-01-06T18:01:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/2021-12-117865212-d3152b21-cf3e-4467-9046-10e32883c3b8.jpg
Kyiv, Moscow reach preliminary agreement to prioritize wounded POWs in future exchanges	Ukraine and Russia have reached a &quot;preliminary agreement&quot; to conduct regular prisoner exchanges throughout the year, focusing on the return of seriously ill and severely wounded prisoners of war (POWs), Ukraine&apos;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets announced on Jan. 6. In an interview with the state-run parliamentary broadcaster Rada, Lubinets expressed hope that Russia would honor its commitment. &quot;I do not want this to come across as an official announcement just yet. But we will see if the Russian side keeps its word. If they do, Ukrainian society will notice the systematic nature in terms of quantity, timing, and categories [of prisoners returning home].&quot; Under the revised approach for preparing exchange lists, priority will now go to those who are severely injured or critically ill, followed by prisoners who have been in captivity the longest. &quot;For the first time, we managed to establish that we will create lists primarily based on physical health,&quot; Lubinets added. In 2024, Ukraine conducted 11 prisoner exchanges and secured the return of 356 more people than in 2023. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, 3,956 people have been released, including 1,358 in 2024. President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed the numbers in his New Year video address published late on Dec. 31. On Dec. 30, Ukraine successfully secured the release of 189 captives from Russian detention, including military personnel and two civilians. The coordination headquarters described it as one of the largest exchanges since the start of the full-scale war. Among those freed were defenders of Azovstal, Mariupol, the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant, Snake Island, and other key front lines.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-moscow-reach-preliminary-agreement-to-prioritize-wounded-pows-in-future-exchanges/	2025-01-06T15:37:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1988735177.jpg
Zelensky says nearly 15,000 Russians have been killed in Kursk region	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 6 that Russian forces had sustained significant losses over five months of fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk region. &quot;During the Kursk operation, the enemy has already lost 38,000 of their soldiers in this direction alone, with nearly 15,000 of these losses being irreversible,&quot; Zelensky added in his evening address. He did not provide evidence to support the figures he cited for Russian casualties, so the Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the information. The Kursk region lies on the border with Ukraine&apos;s Sumy Oblast, which has been experiencing daily attacks since Russian troops were pushed out of the oblast and back across the border in April 2022. Ukrainian forces launched a large-scale operation in the Kursk region in early August, capturing sections of the territory. However, the Russian military claims it has regained control over much of that land. On Jan. 5, Ukraine reported initiating a new offensive in the area but shared limited information about it. Reports from Ukrainian and Western sources suggest that around 11,000 North Korean troops are aiding Russian forces in the region. Russia has not confirmed or denied their involvement. The Russian Defense Ministry reported on Monday that Ukrainian forces were stopped, and their primary units were destroyed near Berdin, a settlement along a road leading northeast to the city of Kursk. Zelensky highlighted the creation of a &quot;buffer zone&quot; in the Kursk region, where Russia had stationed substantial military reinforcements. According to him, this development has hindered Moscow&#x2019;s ability to deploy those forces to critical battlefronts in eastern Ukraine. &quot;Importantly, the (Russian forces) cannot now direct all this strength to our other directions, particular to Donetsk, Sumy, Kharkiv, or Zaporizhzhia oblasts,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-says-nearly-15-000-russians-have-been-killed-in-kursk-region/	2025-01-06T13:56:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166323213.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine strikes 3 Russian air defense systems in single day; 3,800 North Korean troops killed, injured in Kursk Oblast	Key developments on Jan. 6: Two Russian anti-missile Pantsir-S1 systems and one OSA anti-aircraft vehicle were damaged or destroyed by Ukraine&apos;s Navy in one day, the military branch claimed on Jan. 6. &quot;Our soldiers continue to turn Russian equipment into scrap metal,&quot; Ukrainian Navy Commander Oleksii Neizhpapa said in a Facebook post referring to the three successful attacks. In his post, Neizhpapa shared a video apparently depicting a drone zeroing in on a Russian Pantsir-S1 vehicle, claiming that the two Pantsir-S1 were destroyed in the occupied territory of Ukraine&#x2019;s Kherson Oblast. A Pantsir S-1 has an estimated price tag of around $15 million. One such system is suspected to be behind the mistaken downing of an Azerbaijani plane on Dec. 25, according to the media. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video that purports to show a Ukrainian strike against a Russian Pantsir air defense system. Footage published on Jan. 6, 2024. (Ukraine&apos;s Navy/Telegram)Developed in the Soviet Union in the 1960s, the 9K33 Osa (SA-8 Gecko according to NATO terminology) is a highly mobile, short-range, low-altitude surface-to-air missile system still in use by Russia, Ukraine, and a dozen other countries. The Osa has been used with great effect by the Russian Armed Forces against Ukrainian drones, with some experts linking it to Ukraine scaling down the use of its once-popular Bayraktar drones. The system functions as an all-in-one transporter erector launcher and radar (TELAR) vehicle that can detect and attack enemy targets independently. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the Navy&apos;s claims nor the extent of the damage done to the Russian anti-aircraft and anti-missile systems. Russia has lost 1,034 air defense systems since the full-scale invasion began, Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces reported before the news of the three successful hits surfaced. A total of 3,800 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded by Ukrainian forces in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with American podcaster Lex Fridman published on Jan. 5. Pyongyang sent upwards of 12,000 North Korean soldiers into Kursk Oblast in the fall of 2024, amid an agreement to help counter a surprise Ukrainian incursion into the region which began on Aug. 6. Ukrainian forces have been fighting to hold onto territory in the region ever since in hopes it can be used as a bargaining chip in future negotiations with Russia. Zelensky, in his wide-ranging interview with Lex Fridman, added that Pyongyang has the capabilities to bring additional North Korean troops to the front, as many as 30,000 -40,000 troops. Ukraine reportedly ramped up its operations in Kursk Oblast with a new offensive on Jan. 5, with mixed reports surfacing on outcome of the renewed push from Kyiv. The renewed offensive comes amid significant losses among Russian and North Korean forces during recent clashes, Zelensky said in his evening address on Jan. 4, citing information from Ukraine&apos;s top commander. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Dec. 27 that North Korean units had been carrying out &quot;human wave&quot; attacks against Ukrainian positions in Kursk Oblast, with little effect &#x2014; amounting to high casualty totals. Kirby added that North Korean soldiers have reportedly taken their own lives rather than surrender to Ukrainian troops, out of fear their families will be targeted over their capture. Ukraine and Russia are rushing to make up ground in Kursk Oblast before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes power on Jan. 2o. Trump has previously said he would end the war in &quot;24 hours&quot; with potential peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. U.S. officials told Bloomberg on Dec. 27 that they believe Ukraine may only have a few months left in its incursion into Kursk Oblast until Ukraine&apos;s military is forced to retreat from the region or risk being encircled by Russian forces. The comments come as Ukraine has steadily lost ground in the region amid Russian counterattacks. Ukraine has reportedly lost over 40% of territory it previously gained in due to renewed Russian efforts. Outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Jan. 6 that Ukrainian positions in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast could play an important role in possible talks with Russia, the AFP news agency reported. The Biden administration, whose term expires in a few weeks, has sped up the delivery of military assistance to Ukraine to put Kyiv in the strongest possible position in potential peace negotiations. &quot;Their (Ukraine&apos;s) position in Kursk is an important one because certainly it&apos;s something that would factor in any negotiation that may come about in the coming year,&quot; Blinken told reporters in Seoul. The comments come at the heels of reports of Ukraine launching new offensive operations in Kursk Oblast after months of being on the defensive. Ukraine launched the cross-border incursion in early August, allegedly seizing 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian soil. Since then, Moscow has deployed reinforcements, including thousands of North Korean soldiers, and reportedly recaptured around half of the lost territory. President Volodymyr Zelensky also called the Kursk incursion an important &quot;trump card&quot; in any potential talks. There are growing expectations of possible peace talks in 2025 as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who will take office on Jan. 20, pledged to bring both sides to the negotiating table. Trump&apos;s return to the White House sparked concerns among Ukraine&apos;s allies due to the president-elect&apos;s past criticism of the Biden administration&apos;s support for Kyiv. In comments made since his reelection, Trump hinted at a possible reduction of U.S. assistance but said he would not &quot;abandon&quot; the country, instead aiming to leverage Washington&apos;s aid to push Russia to negotiate. President Volodymyr Zelensky previously offered U.S. President-elect Donald Trump for Ukraine to buy American weapons at the expense of $300 billion in frozen Russian assets, Zelensky revealed in an interview with American podcaster Lex Fridman published on Jan. 5. &quot;This is one of the security guarantees. Take the money, what we need for our interior production, and we will buy all the weapons from the United States. We don&apos;t need gifts from the United States,&quot; Zelensky said in his wide-ranging interview with Fridman. &quot;It will be very good for your industry. For the United States. We will put money there. Russian money. Not Ukrainian. Not European. Russian money. Russian assets. They have to pay for this,&quot; Zelensky added. Zelensky did not comment on Trump&apos;s reaction to the suggestion. Trump and his team have been critical of U.S. spending to support Ukraine. Michael Waltz, Trump&apos;s appointed National Security Advisor for his upcoming term said on Dec. 15 that a &quot;blank check... just isn&apos;t a strategy.&quot; Despite previously criticizing U.S. aid for Ukraine, the Financial Times reported on Dec. 21, citing undisclosed sources, that Trump may not halt U.S. military support for Ukraine. Zelensky has taken steps to foster a positive relationship with Trump, despite previously having a fraught relationship stemming from Trump&#x2019;s 2019 impeachment trial. The two leaders met on Sept. 27 in the midst of the U.S. presidential election campaign. They met again on the sidelines of the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral, alongside French President Emmanuel Macron on Dec. 7. &quot;He (Trump) is strong... He is young... and his brains work,&quot; Zelensky said when asked why he thinks Trump won the U.S. presidential election in November. Zelensky previously said that the country must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means in 2025, adding that a war would &quot;end faster&quot; under a Trump administration. Shortly after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko apologized to President Volodymyr Zelensky over the country&apos;s involvement in the war, Zelensky revealed in an interview with American podcaster Lex Fridman published on Jan. 5. &quot;A few days into the war, I spoke with Lukashenko on the phone, and he apologized... he said, &apos;It was not me, missiles were launched from my territory, and (Russian President Vladimir) Putin was the one launching them.&apos; These are his words, I have witnesses,&quot; Zelensky said in his wide-ranging interview. &quot;&apos;And I apologize,&apos; he said. &apos;But believe me&apos; &#x2014; that&apos;s what he told me &#x2014; &apos;Volodya (referring to Volodymyr Zelensky), this is not me. I&#x2019;m not in charge,&apos;&quot; Zelensky added. In response, Zelensky said that he called Lukashenko &quot;a murderer,&quot; questioning why Lukashenko allowed Russia to launch missiles at Ukraine from Belarusian territory. Lukashenko became increasingly reliant on Russia after isolating Belarus from the West, following Belarus&apos; 2020 election. Lukashenko&apos;s opposition and the West condemned the results as fraudulent. Lukashenko cracked down on mass protests that broke out in response to the fraudulent election results. Since then, Belarusian authorities have increasingly suppressed political freedoms and have become complacent in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Despite not being directly involved in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Belarus continues to host Russian troops and missiles on its territory. Lukashenko asked Putin on Dec. 6 to deploy the Oreshnik missile systems in Belarus, a weapon Russia recently used to strike Ukraine, Russian state-controlled news agency RIA Novosti reported. As many as 10 missile systems will be deployed, according to pro-Kremlin journalist Alexander Yunashev. Belarus will be holding its next presidential election on Jan. 26 where Lukashenko is expected to be handed a seventh term in office. The energy crisis in Transnistria, triggered by Russia&apos;s Jan. 1 cutoff of gas supplies, is part of a broader Russian plan to manipulate and spread propaganda, Moldovan government spokesperson Daniel Voda said on Jan. 6. &quot;Russian propaganda tries to create a story in which Moldova becomes a &#x2018;problematic actor,&#x2019; although the government has proposed clear solutions to avoid the crisis,&quot; he said. Gazprom, Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled energy giant, halted gas deliveries to Moldova, citing alleged unpaid debts by Moldovagaz. Moldovan officials disputed these claims, noting an international audit failed to verify the debts. Transnistria, a Russian-occupied region since the early 1990s, relies heavily on Russian gas and has faced industrial collapse due to widespread power outages and heating failures. Voda said the crisis reflects Russia&apos;s deliberate effort to create fear and unrest. &quot;This energy crisis is more than an economic problem &#x2014; it is part of a larger Russian plan of manipulation and propaganda designed to create fear and discontent on both banks of the Dnister.&quot; Nearly 72,000 homes and 1,500 high-rise buildings in Transnistria are without heating or hot water, according to Vadim Krasnoselsky, leader of the region&#x2019;s Russian-backed administration. Moldova previously offered to help Transnistria purchase gas through European platforms, but local Russian-backed authorities rejected the proposal, claiming Western energy prices are &quot;higher and unstable.&quot; The spokesperson criticized the refusal, calling it a failure to &quot;cooperate for the benefit of the people.&quot; Russian propaganda has sought to blame Chisinau for the crisis, alleging that Moldovan authorities intentionally caused power outages to punish the region, Voda said. While a transit agreement for Russian gas through Ukraine expired on the same day, Gazprom maintains that Moldova&#x2019;s debts, not transit issues, prompted the suspension. While the rest of Moldova has transitioned to European energy supplies through Romania, Transnistria remains heavily dependent on Russian gas. French President Emmanuel Macron on Jan. 6 called on Ukraine to have &quot;realistic discussions on territorial issues&quot; as they alone can conduct them. &quot;There will be no quick and easy solution in Ukraine,&quot; Macron said in an address to French ambassadors in the Elysee Palace. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has previously vowed to bring both sides to the negotiating table and swiftly end the war. &quot;The U.S. must help us to change the nature of the situation and convince Russia to come to the negotiating table,&quot; Macron said in comments quoted by France24. Russia currently occupies around 20% of Ukrainian territory. President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged that Ukraine&apos;s military currently lacks the strength to retake all of it by force, noting that some regions, like Crimea, will have to be liberated through diplomatic means. In his address, the French head of state warned of repercussions for Europe and the U.S. should Ukraine emerge from the war on the losing side. &quot;The new American president himself knows that the U.S. has no chance of winning anything if Ukraine loses,&quot; Macron said. France&apos;s president also said that it would be up to European countries to &quot;build security guarantees&quot; for Ukraine, a statement in line with his calls for greater European strategic autonomy. Paris has spearheaded the idea of deploying European peacekeepers to Ukraine after a possible ceasefire deal is reached. Trump, who vowed to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the conflict, has reportedly backed the idea, while Russia has rejected it. Trump&apos;s imminent return to the White House, Ukraine&apos;s military setbacks, and Russia&apos;s growing economic difficulties have contributed to expectations of possible peace talks in 2025. Kyiv&apos;s allies have said they seek to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position for any possible negotiations, with German government saying on Jan. 6 that peace cannot be &quot;dictated&quot; from Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-strikes-3-russian-air-defense-systems-in-single-day-3-800-north-korean-troops-killed-or-injured-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-01-06T12:26:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Picture1.png
Negative lesson' — Ground Forces chief acknowledges desertions, mismanagement in French-trained brigade	Mykhailo Drapatyi, commander of Ukraine&#x2019;s Ground Forces, acknowledged significant challenges within the French-trained 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Mechanized Brigade, including high desertion rates and poor organization, during a Jan. 6 press conference. &quot;Of course, this is a negative lesson, a negative experience, but it should be converted into some kind of preventative action,&quot; Drapatyi said. The general&apos;s remarks followed a media investigation that claimed soldiers of the unit, currently deployed near Pokrovsk, have suffered losses and gone AWOL (absent without leave) in large numbers due to poor command and organization within Ukraine&#x2019;s military leadership. The 155th Brigade, formed with support from Ukraine&#x2019;s Western partners, was intended to be a flagship project to train new military units equipped with heavy weaponry. French President Emmanuel Macron&#x2019;s announcement in June that France would provide training and military supplies was part of this initiative. The brigade was meant to consist of about 5,800 troops, but fewer than 2,000 have undergone training in France. Despite Paris fulfilling its commitments for training and arms provision, an investigation led by Yurii Butusov, editor-in-chief of Ukrainian media outlet Censor.net, pointed to problems in the creation and management of the brigade allegedly leading to 1,700 cases of soldiers going AWOL from the unit before it fired a shot. According to Butusov, the failure to provide critical equipment, such as drones and electronic warfare tools, hampered the brigade&#x2019;s combat readiness when it was deployed in November. &quot;There are problems, and there were problems in staffing, training, and partially in the command staff,&quot; Drapatyi said. &quot;This is all consciously analyzed, and certain conclusions have been drawn.&quot; The general added that lessons learned from these difficulties are being used to improve the brigade and avoid similar issues in the future. Drapatyi acknowledged these challenges, pointing out that desertion was often driven by fear and a lack of combat experience. &quot;There are many manifestations of unauthorized abandonment of military units, but there are also reasons for this,&quot; he said. &quot;There is the fear of the personnel [...], and sometimes the lack of practical experience in combat operations.&quot; Of the 1,924 soldiers sent to France, only 51 had more than a year of military service, while 1,414 had served less than two months, according to the Censor.net investigation. The commander emphasized that the military is actively addressing the brigade&#x2019;s issues. &quot;I confirm that there were problematic issues with the command staff and the training process, and they are all being resolved now,&quot; he said. Despite the challenges, Drapatyi remained optimistic about the brigade&#x2019;s future. &quot;The brigade is developing, fighting, inflicting losses on the enemy,&quot; he said. The report comes amid growing calls for reform within Ukraine&#x2019;s military leadership as Kyiv grapples with intensifying pressure in its war with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/negative-lesson-ukraines-ground-forces-chief-acknowledges-desertions-mismanagement-in-french-trained-brigade/	2025-01-06T11:40:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2113280448.jpg
Zelensky takes on Putin apologists, US skeptics on 3-hour Lex Fridman podcast	In a newly released three-hour interview, Moscow-born U.S. podcaster Lex Fridman tried to persuade President Volodymyr Zelensky that Russian President Vladimir Putin is &#x201C;a serious person who loves his country.&quot; &#x201C;He loves his inner circle. It&#x2019;s only a small part of the people. He doesn&apos;t love (the Russian people),&#x201D; Zelensky countered. &#x201C;You cannot send your people to another land to die, knowing that they will die. The boys he sends (to fight in Ukraine) are 18-years-old. They are children. It&#x2019;s not that fascists came to his land, and he needs to defend it &#x2014; he came to ours, and he sent them.&#x201D; With nearly five million subscribers on his YouTube channel, Fridman organized an interview with Zelensky that was published on Jan. 5 as part of what he described as his &#xA0;&#x201C;small part in pushing for peace.&#x201D; Fridman&#x2019;s show has previously hosted controversial figures, including U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, entrepreneur Elon Musk, political commentator Vivek Ramaswamy, and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, all of whom have advanced narratives portraying Ukraine as a corrupt nation bent on escalating war with Russia. In this context, Zelensky&#x2019;s appearance on Fridman&#x2019;s podcast appeared to be a savvy move aimed at reaching a segment of the Western audience misinformed about the realities of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. Throughout the interview, Zelensky navigated Fridman&#x2019;s idealized view of Ukraine-Russia relations &#x2014; sometimes through a slew of curse words &#x2014; including the idea that Ukrainians would forgive Russians in the near future, and that the two nations could return to a semblance of their former &#x201C;brotherly&#x201D; union. Ahead of their meeting, Fridman took to X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, to publicly urge Zelensky to conduct the conversation in Russian, citing it as the only language in which both men were fluent. &#x201C;Speaking in a language we&apos;re both fluent in will result in the most deep, dynamic, and powerful conversation,&#x201D; Fridman wrote. Moscow-born U.S. podcaster Lex Fridman during his interview with President Volodymyr Zelensky in a video posted on Jan.5, 2024. (Lex Fridman / YouTube)During the interview, Fridman was met with a lighthearted jab from Zelensky, who, with a smile, remarked that Fridman&#x2019;s Russian was &#x201C;not that great.&#x201D; Throughout his career as an actor and comedian, Zelensky was a fixture of Ukraine&#x2019;s Russian-speaking cultural sphere, enjoying widespread popularity in both Ukraine and Russia. But as Zelensky explained to Fridman, the past decade of war with Russia &#x2014; and particularly the nearly three years since the full-scale invasion &#x2014; had dramatically shifted many Ukrainians&#x2019; perspectives on the use of the Russian language in society. &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t respond in Russian the entire interview, because this is how it is today. I am not making anything up, you can see it all for yourself, you can feel and hear it,&#x201D; Zelensky said, while mentioning the number of Russian missiles and drones launched at Ukraine in a recent attack. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think you can just pretend that nothing is happening and give Putin a pass once again for saying that we are one people, that we speak one language. (Russians) speak the language of weapons. That is a fact. And we are peaceful people.&#x201D; Undeterred, Fridman countered with a note of optimism, expressing his &quot;hope&quot; on the first of several occasions that the Russian people &#x2014; and perhaps even Putin himself &#x2014; might see the interview. Zelensky reminded Fridman that he had made a direct appeal to the Russian people in their own language at the outset of the full-scale war, only to be met with silence. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re mute,&#x201D; Zelensky said, adding: &#x201C;They did not listen.&#x201D; A billboard promoting contract army service and reading &quot;5 200 000 rubles for the first year of the contract&quot; (about $57,000) is seen in western Moscow, Russia on Sept. 11, 2024. (Alexander Nemenov / AFP via Getty Images)Zelensky also pushed back against Fridman&#x2019;s concern that translation might dull the impact of their conversation &#x2014; a puzzling point given the interview was ultimately made available entirely in Ukrainian, English, and Russian using awkward, AI-generated voiceovers. &#x201C;I think what is most important is what we&#x2019;re talking about, not how,&#x201D; Zelensky said. The question of language set the tone for the interview before it even began, with Fridman&#x2019;s talking points suggesting he appeared to want to not only reinforce his own narrative about Ukraine, but also to subtly encourage Zelensky to align with his perspective. &#x201C;Do you think there will ever be a day when the Ukrainian people will ever forgive the Russian people? And both peoples will travel back and forth again and marry each other, rekindle and form friendships?&#x201D; Fridman asked. Although visibly taken aback by the question, Zelensky said that history has demonstrated the possibility of such an outcome. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know how it will be for us,&#x201D; he said before emphasizing a crucial condition: any path forward would require Russians to first acknowledge their culpability as the aggressor in the war. Perhaps the key topic Fridman raised during the interview was the issue of U.S. aid, and concerns about its potential misuse. Fridman said that how Ukraine addresses these corruption allegations will be a crucial factor in shaping the country&apos;s future trajectory. While clarifying that much of U.S. aid to Ukraine consists of military support rather than direct financial assistance, Zelensky highlighted the development of a sophisticated anti-corruption system under his leadership, calling it &#x201C;the most advanced in all of Europe,&#x201D; and a vital element of Ukraine&#x2019;s journey towards EU membership. Zelensky was referring to institutions such as the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), which is responsible for investigating and prosecuting high-level corruption among officials. Though these institutions have not been without their own controversies regarding the impartiality of some of its officials, Zelensky expressed confidence in their ability to uncover and address any institutional corruption within Ukraine. Ukraine has grappled with multiple corruption scandals tied to wartime procurement. Some Defense Ministry officials under the tenure of former Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov were accused of embezzling money through the purchase of low-quality equipment for soldiers, as well as purchasing food for the military at inflated prices. Ukrainian authorities have also detained a number of military enlistment officers on charges of accepting bribes from men attempting to evade deployment to the front lines. &#x201C;We talk about (corruption) openly,&#x201D; Zelensky said, adding: &#x201C;We are genuinely fighting against it.&#x201D; &#x201C;I am sure Ukraine will overcome all this. (But) this takes a little time.&#x201D; Zelensky also spoke of his administration&#x2019;s successes in curbing oligarch influence, citing the incarceration of Ihor Kolomoisky &#x2014; one of Ukraine&#x2019;s most powerful oligarchs &#x2014; as a major achievement. Zelensky also suggested that corruption was an issue in Western countries. Ukraine has received less than half of the $177 billion in U.S. aid allocated to support Kyiv throughout the full-scale war, according to Zelensky. He suggested that this shortfall could be tied to issues of corruption or lobbying by U.S. companies. &quot;If we had $177 billion and if we get the half, where is the second half? If you find the second half, you will find corruption,&quot; he said. Fridman shared his &#x201C;dream&#x201D; of a scenario in which Trump could facilitate a meeting between Zelensky and Putin to bring the war to an end. Zelensky argued that it was &#x201C;naive&#x201D; to believe Putin genuinely sought an end to the war, emphasizing the need to approach negotiations from a position of strength &#x2014; an outcome he hoped Trump could help facilitate. &#x201C;President Trump will be in the same situation as I was in 2019 &#x2014; precisely the same situation. I want to end the war, and we want lasting peace for Ukraine. We must do this. The ceasefire, exchange people, and then diplomatically return all territories, and we will do this through diplomacy,&#x201D; Zelensky said. &#x201C;What will happen next with President Trump? If the ceasefire happens without security guarantees, at least for the territory we control, what does he get? If he manages to make a ceasefire deal and three months later Putin launches a new wave of attacks, what will Trump look like? What will Ukraine look like?&#x201D; (L-R) President Volodymyr Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, Russian President Vladimir Putin and then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel attend their summit on Ukraine at Elysee Palace in Paris, France on Dec. 9, 2019. (Christophe Petit Tesson - Pool/Getty Images)To explain why he didn&#x2019;t believe Putin was interested in a peace deal, Zelensky recalled the 2019 Normandy Format meeting, a high-stakes summit in which he joined French President Emmanuel Macron, then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Putin to negotiate a ceasefire in the ongoing war. According to Zelensky, Putin appeared strikingly uninformed about key details, such as the length of the front line or the timeline required to disengage troops &#x2014; an omission Zelensky attributed to Putin&#x2019;s lack of intention to follow through on any ceasefire deal. The Russian leader, however, displayed marked preparation on one topic: maintaining gas transit agreements, underscoring the economic stakes that loomed over the discussions. The ceasefire lasted less than a month, and Putin stopped taking Zelensky&#x2019;s calls. Russia sent snipers to Ukraine&#x2019;s eastern regions, where they honed their skills by &#x201C;hunting&#x201D; the very Ukrainian civilians that Putin claimed the war was intended to protect, Zelensky said. These snipers were then deployed to other conflict zones in Africa and the Middle East, according to Zelensky. Proof of this sent to international organizations like the U.N. went unheeded, Zelensky said. &#x201C;(Putin) is darkness personified. And you offer him, as it were, to be subjectivized. There&#x2019;s only one reason: fear,&#x201D; Zelensky said. &#x201C;And you say we need to talk. Listen. We need to be in a strong position and not talk but end the war.&#x201D; Zelensky went on to warn that without security guarantees, such as NATO membership, Putin would inevitably launch another invasion of Ukraine in the future. Calls for compromise as a means to reach an agreement with Russia drew a swift and pointed rebuke from Zelensky, who argued that Ukraine asking for NATO membership was in itself a compromise. Zelensky went on to tell Fridman that Putin&apos;s continued freedom &#x2014; and the improbability of him ever facing imprisonment &#x2014; was itself a compromise, and that it was impossible to forgive Putin for the war. &#x201C;To forgive? No one will forgive. It is absolutely impossible to forgive him,&#x201D; Zelensky said, his tone resolute as he sought to drive home the gravity of the losses Ukraine has endured. &#x201C;We cannot comprehend the mind or soul of someone who has lost their family,&#x201D; he added, invoking the countless Ukrainian families who have suffered the loss of children, in particular, what he called the loss of &#x201C;the most precious thing in this world.&#x201D; While U.S. Democrats promoted the idea that Trump is &#x201C;pro-Putin,&#x201D; Zelensky notably took the opportunity during the interview to contrast the leadership skills of Trump and Putin. Zelensky implied that Trump as U.S. president cared more about his people, given the number of places he visited across the country during the presidential campaign.

(Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;I pray to God that (war) will never be on your land,&#x201D; Zelensky said. &#x201C;But I&#x2019;m sure if you had some (natural disaster) on your land that President Trump would be there (in a matter of days). Otherwise, how will people look at him?&#x201D; Zelensky went on to note that Putin had yet to visit Kursk Oblast, part of which is now under Ukrainian military control, since Kyiv launched an incursion in August. This failure to visit Kursk Oblast and be with the people there, Zelensky argued, highlighted the disconnect between Putin&#x2019;s propaganda-fueled image as a leader devoted to protecting his people and the reality of his actions. Amid the gravity of the topics addressed during the far-reaching interview, one moment captured Zelensky&#x2019;s perspective with a touch of dark humor &#x2014; a nod to his past as a comedian. When Fridman jokingly floated the idea of a hypothetical meeting between Zelensky and Putin by the sea, Zelensky quipped: &#x201C;One of us may drown. And I am a good swimmer.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-takes-on-putin-apologists-us-skeptics-on-3-hour-lex-fridman-podcast/	2025-01-06T11:38:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190032907.jpg
As Russians inch closer to Pokrovsk, civilians in the area are left with a choice — stay under fire or leave life behind	BILOZERSKE, Donetsk Oblast &#x2014; Less than 30 kilometers north of embattled Pokrovsk, a market was in full swing in the town of Bilozerske. Meters away, however, a crowd has gathered in front of a building, nervously awaiting the doors to open. Tensions were visibly mounting as the doors remained closed and impatience settled. An umpteenth air raid siren reminded everyone about the never-ending threat from Russian drones and glide bombs in the area. Nobody seemed to care about a potential attack. People were waiting for hours at the distribution point, seeking their turn to receive hygiene kits and water supplies. No one seemed to want to lose their place in the queue. Anastasia Olekh, from the Caritas Mariupol non-government humanitarian organization, said that Bilozerske remains full of people in need, becoming a safe haven for those fleeting towns and villages closer to the front line. &#x201C;Prior to the full-scale invasion, there were around 15,000 people here. Since 2022, many have left, but we also saw an additional 5,000 displaced people coming from settlements of the Pokrovsk district directly under fire,&#x201D; Olekh said. The city of Pokrovsk, which once counted some 60,000 residents, now counts a mere 11,000 thousand, with Russian troops aiming to surround and occupy it while gradually turning the city into rubble. &#x201C;So far, Bilozerske has not been too affected by war, and its coal mine is still open, which means there is still work for civilians, but the living conditions are dire,&#x201D; Olekh added. Valentyna, a 65-year-old resident of Bilozerske, has chosen to stay in the town with her husband and their dog. Valentyna says she is aware of the danger, yet chooses, for now, to not leave because of the lack of funds and opportunities elsewhere. &#x201C;Compared to Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, or Pokrovsk, it is safer here as long as we are not being shelled,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;We know that when they (the Russians) will reach Pokrovsk, they will try to finish us off here as well. But we simply don&#x2019;t have anywhere else to go,&#x201D; she added. Valentyna&#x2019;s biggest fear is glide bombs, which Russia has been increasingly using in 2024. &#x201C;Since they have started to launch them, we no longer feel safe. Our air defense can shoot down missiles, but not glide bombs; those are just terrible; that&#x2019;s why we are hoping for some kind of truce, through diplomatic channels, so that those bombs no longer fly,&#x201D; she said.

(Emmanuelle Chaze / The Kyiv Independent)Not far from Valentyna, Olena, 42, was also standing in the queue. Olena used to work on a farm near Bilozerske, where she lives with her family. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m here with my 15-year-old daughter and my five-year-old son,&#x201D; she said, adding that she also takes care of her mother with cancer, thus unable to leave the town. &#x201C;My main worry is my children, right now, they are cut out from the world,&#x201D; she added. Not far from the queue, local residents Svitlana and her husband were loading a month&#x2019;s worth of water supplies in their car. The retired couple from Bilozerske had no intention of leaving. Over the deafening sound of sirens, Svitlana seemed annoyed even at the thought of evacuation, although theoretically, it is mandatory in the area. &#x201C;Look, my husband and I are both 72. We have lived in Bilozerske for the last 50 years. We got married here, our children grew up and were baptized here, what is the point of leaving? Obviously it is scary, but no, we will not be leaving,&#x201D; she said. Olena, 42, in Bilozerske, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine on Dec.9, 2024. (Emmanuelle Chaze / The Kyiv Independent)Whether bound by financial constraints or memories of peaceful times at home, most civilians feel they have nowhere else to go, and while Bilozerske doesn&#x2019;t &#x2013; yet &#x2013; lie directly in the combat zone, some, who have already relocated once, simply feel trapped here for lack of better options. Anastasia came from Toretsk, which has seen some of the heaviest fighting since 2022. According to Ukraine&#x2019;s military, the fighting is currently ongoing in the town&#x2019;s streets. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve already moved once, a year ago, as the situation has become unbearable in Toretsk. Our flat has since been looted and then destroyed. I was already used to living in combat zone, so in comparison, things have been quiet here,&#x201D; Anastasia said. &#x201C;Anyway, I can&#x2019;t afford to move further away from the front line, you just have to look at the steep price rise for flats in Dnipro, in Poltava, for example, to understand why we stay here,&#x201D; she added. Those who have relatives elsewhere or take safety over the potential hardship far from home make their way to Pavlohrad, in nearby Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Following the Russian offensive targeting Pokrovsk, the city of Pavlohrad became the new evacuation hub for those fleeing the embattled Donetsk Oblast. Once home to 100,000 people and located 100 kilometers west from Pokrovsk, Pavlohrad is now overcrowded with people desperate to flee and officials and volunteers helping them get by. Around the clock, cars, buses, and vans are bringing those evacuated from Donetsk Oblast. What had been a theater hall is now a dormitory for those awaiting their train or bus further west. Residents are brought to a theater-turned-dormitory in Pavlohrad, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Ukraine on Dec. 9, 2024.

(Emmanuelle Chaze / The Kyiv Independent)Seats have been piled at the back of the hall to make way for folding beds. Blue care packages from the United Nations lie around. The theater hall is silent, but each of its residents bears the traces of war: in semi-darkness, a handful of elderly wait to be brought to a more permanent accommodation, surrounded by a few plastic bags containing all of the belongings they were able to take with them. Near the stage, a woman was sitting in a state of shock, surrounded by her two dogs. She came from Kurakhove, and counts among the last people evacuated from the city. On Jan. 6, Russia declared it had captured Kurakhove, a bombed-out town, the population of which decreased from 18,000 to a mere 2,000 people since the start of the all-out war. Exhausted, the woman can barely speak, and is in need of medical treatment. Near her, an elderly man with crutches was sitting on his bed, where he was taking notes in a small notebook, using his mobile phone as a torchlight. Another woman muttered unintelligible words to herself, folding and unfolding a few clothes on her bed. In the corridor, Viktor, 66, a former miner, has just arrived from Myhrnohrad. His eyes were hollow, he was still shaking. Sitting on a bench, he was waiting for registration and would go whenever he was sent as long as it was safe. Viktor, 66, a former miner, in Myrnohrad, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine on Dec.9, 2024. (Emmanuelle Chaze / The Kyiv Independent)&#x201C;There were soldiers in the streets, my city is no longer accessible and constantly under shelling. I don&#x2019;t have anywhere to go, nor do I want to get in touch with relatives in safer places. I heard I would go to a shelter in Kyiv Oblast,&#x201D; Viktor said. Disoriented and weak after having spent months with no water, no electricity, and no heating, Viktor followed humanitarian workers in the hall, where he would await a commute to his Kyiv Oblast accommodation. He said he knew he might never come back home. An evacuation was called by authorities of Donetsk Oblast during the summer and autumn, with police, the military and local and international NGOs helping with the evacuation effort. The work is carried out at great risk, as the Russian troops routinely use drones to target civilians and humanitarian workers all over the region. Despite the calls from officials, as of mid-December, around 300,000 civilians remained in Donetsk Oblast, out of which 54,000 lived directly in an active warzone, according to the Donetsk Military Administration. When asked why they would not leave the danger zone, those who spoke with the Kyiv Independent named two reasons &#x2014; tough decision to leave home and lack of opportunities elsewhere.	https://kyivindependent.com/as-russians-inch-closer-to-pokrovsk-civilians-in-the-area-are-left-with-a-choice-stay-under-fire-or-leave-life-behind/	2025-01-06T10:54:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2191061556.jpg
Russian drone attack against bus in Kherson, kills 1, injures 6	A Russian drone strike targeted a bus in a Kherson neighborhood on Jan. 6, killing one person and injuring six others, regional Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. The man killed, Volodymyr Shum, 50, was a specialist in the municipal services and landscaping division of the Kherson City Council&apos;s municipal economy department. Among the injured were five women, aged between 29 and 57, and the 66-year-old driver, all of whom were hospitalized with blast injuries and are undergoing medical evaluation. Kherson and settlements on the west bank of the Dnipro River endure daily Russian attacks as Moscow&apos;s forces maintain control of the river&#x2019;s east bank. Prokudin reported an increase in assaults as Russian troops attempt to solidify their positions in the region. Kherson and its surrounding areas were liberated during Ukraine&#x2019;s fall 2022 counteroffensive but remain under frequent bombardment. A Dec. 1 attack on a shuttle bus in Kherson killed three and injured eight, according to local authorities.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-attack-against-bus-in-kherson-kills-3-injures-at-least-6/	2025-01-06T10:01:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-06_16-32-04.jpg
Europe cannot fill void left by US in Ukraine’s defense	Since the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States, the question on everyone&apos;s mind is whether Europe, including the U.K., can replace the military assistance the U.S. is giving Ukraine. The short answer is no. The reasons for this are a mix of politics and capabilities. The U.S. and the European Union currently provide similar amounts of military aid to Ukraine &#x2014; 43% each, according to the latest figures. In the EU, Germany is the largest donor (12%), and the United Kingdom provides the second-most generous assistance from outside the EU (9%). These figures speak for themselves: For the EU to replace the U.S., it would need to double its military aid to Ukraine. The current political situation in Europe, along with the real military capabilities of individual European countries, means Europe will not be able to step up in the short term. This is bad for Ukraine and bad news for Europe, which is slowly waking up to the reality that without the U.S., it would struggle to mount any meaningful defense against an outside aggressor. How did we get here? After the end of the Cold War, most European countries reduced their military production and/or shifted their military industrial models, focusing on export markets and just-in-time production. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German research center, provides the example of Germany, which has recently increased military spending. But at current rates, it would take decades for the country to replenish its weapons stockpiles to the level they were 20 years ago. According to the European Council on Foreign Relations, &#x201C;Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s war on Ukraine, Europe&#x2019;s defense industry has increased its ammunition production capacity by 50% and aims to produce more than 2 million shells per year by the end of 2025 &#x2014; double its capacity in February 2022,&#x201D; which is a positive development. The European Commission has proposed shifting the EU to a war economy, but this is still in the discussion phase. Ukraine will need more than proposals debated in Brussels to meet the shortfall left by a potential American withdrawal. To complicate matters, defense is one of the least integrated industrial sectors in the EU, meaning it cannot benefit from the economies of scale of the U.S. military-industrial complex. Since Brexit, the U.K. will no longer be able to participate in EU-wide defense industry projects, adding to the challenges. Bilateral agreements between the U.K. and France and between the U.K. and Germany, however, will attempt to facilitate military procurement and development between the U.K. and two major European defense heavyweights.

(Oleg Nikishin/Getty Images)French President Emmanuel Macron has been one of the most vocal Western European leaders calling for an independent European defense and for wholehearted support for Ukraine. But actual progress in ramping up industrial production in France has been slow. France remains one of the smallest contributors of military aid to Ukraine relative to its GDP, although the French have delivered most of what they have promised. The lack of capacity is not just a European problem but a NATO-wide issue. In February 2023, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned that Ukraine&#x2019;s rate of ammunition expenditure was many times higher than the allies&#x2019; current production rate, putting NATO defense industries under strain. Even before Trump&#x2019;s victory, a U.S. disengagement from Europe seemed likely due to strains on its own defense sector and the defense establishment&#x2019;s strategic pivot toward Asia and the Middle East. Keir Giles of Chatham House, whose book &#x201C;Who Will Defend Europe&#x201D; was launched earlier this month, argues that Europe always knew what Trump&#x2019;s arrival would mean for Ukraine. A precursor was seen earlier this year when Congress blocked the new military aid package to Ukraine. The result on the battlefield was clear in terms of loss of men and territory. Giles&#x2019; warning is dire: &#x201C;If Washington resigns, there is nothing to stand in the way of Russia,&#x201D; be it for Ukraine or for Europe as a whole. As Ukraine approaches the third anniversary of all-out war with Russia, pressure is mounting on its leaders to negotiate. Because of years of &#x201C;criminal dereliction of duty&#x201D; by European governments, as Giles calls it, Europe now finds itself in a position where it cannot defend a country that has sacrificed tens, maybe hundreds, of thousands of lives to defend not only its own territory but Europe as a whole. At the time of writing, Germany, Europe&#x2019;s largest military donor to Ukraine, has plunged into political chaos with the collapse of the Olaf Scholz-led coalition. France&#x2019;s Macron, a staunch defender of Ukraine despite his initial impulses to seek dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin, has lost much of his freedom of action since the June parliamentary elections, where he lost his majority. Elsewhere in Europe, political parties on the far right and far left, with pro-Russian sympathies, are rising. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a friend of Putin and Trump, is a major obstacle to EU-wide military assistance to Ukraine. The countries on Europe&#x2019;s new frontline &#x2014; the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, as well as Poland &#x2014; understand the Russian threat. They have been generous toward Ukraine in absolute terms while ramping up their own defense spending. While the EU and its member states have made strides in increasing military aid and production, the stark reality remains that Europe cannot yet fill the void left by the U.S., either in terms of its own defense or that of Ukraine. As long as perceived national interests continue to diverge and political stability wavers, particularly in key countries like Germany and France, Europe will struggle to forge a unified and effective response to the war raging on its continent. But the time for Europe to confront its obligations is now, as the stakes have never been higher. This should start by emulating Poland and the Nordic countries, understanding that defending Ukraine is not an act of charity, but the number one priority for self-defense.

Trudeau to resign as Prime Minister, party leader, to stay in office until replacement selected	Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Jan. 1 that he will step down as leader of the ruling Liberal Party but remain in office until the party selects a new leader. Under Trudeau&#x2019;s leadership, Canada has been a strong ally of Ukraine, providing 19.5 billion Canadian dollars ($13.5 billion) in assistance, including 4.5 billion Canadian dollars ($3.1 billion) in military aid. &quot;This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it has become clear to me that if I&#x2019;m having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election,&quot; he said. Trudeau has faced mounting pressure from his party, particularly after the abrupt resignation of Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland on Dec. 16. Public support for the prime minister has waned over the past year, and the opposition Conservative Party, led by Pierre Poilievre, has consistently outperformed him in polls. The next federal election is scheduled for October 2025, but a snap election may occur as opposition parties have pledged to bring a no-confidence vote when parliament reconvenes on Jan. 27. Trudeau made history as Canada&apos;s youngest Prime Minister when he was elected in 2015. As a hereditary politician, he is the son of Pierre Trudeau, who held the office from 1968 to 1979 and again from 1980 to 1984.	https://kyivindependent.com/canadian-pm-trudeau-to-resign-as-liberal-leader-stay-in-office-until-replacement-selected/	2025-01-06T09:03:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2157822397.jpg
Russia fueling Transnistria energy crisis for propaganda, destabilization, Moldova says	The energy crisis in Transnistria, triggered by Russia&apos;s Jan. 1 cutoff of gas supplies, is part of a broader Russian plan to manipulate and spread propaganda, Moldovan government spokesperson Daniel Voda said on Jan. 6. &quot;Russian propaganda tries to create a story in which Moldova becomes a &#x2018;problematic actor,&#x2019; although the government has proposed clear solutions to avoid the crisis,&quot; he said. Gazprom, Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled energy giant, halted gas deliveries to Moldova, citing alleged unpaid debts by Moldovagaz. Moldovan officials disputed these claims, noting an international audit failed to verify the debts. Transnistria, a Russian-occupied region since the early 1990s, relies heavily on Russian gas and has faced industrial collapse due to widespread power outages and heating failures. Voda said the crisis reflects Russia&apos;s deliberate effort to create fear and unrest. &quot;This energy crisis is more than an economic problem &#x2014; it is part of a larger Russian plan of manipulation and propaganda designed to create fear and discontent on both banks of the Dnister.&quot; Nearly 72,000 homes and 1,500 high-rise buildings in Transnistria are without heating or hot water, according to Vadim Krasnoselsky, leader of the region&#x2019;s Russian-backed administration. Moldova previously offered to help Transnistria purchase gas through European platforms, but local Russian-backed authorities rejected the proposal, claiming Western energy prices are &quot;higher and unstable.&quot; The spokesperson criticized the refusal, calling it a failure to &quot;cooperate for the benefit of the people.&quot; Russian propaganda has sought to blame Chisinau for the crisis, alleging that Moldovan authorities intentionally caused power outages to punish the region, Voda said. While a transit agreement for Russian gas through Ukraine expired on the same day, Gazprom maintains that Moldova&#x2019;s debts, not transit issues, prompted the suspension. While the rest of Moldova has transitioned to European energy supplies through Romania, Transnistria remains heavily dependent on Russian gas.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-is-fueling-transnistria-energy-crisis-for-propaganda-destabilization-moldova-says/	2025-01-06T08:38:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-84152606.jpg
Economy Minister: They said no one would invest in country at war. They were wrong	In early 2022, the Ukrainian team of an Austrian wood processing company held a meeting in a bomb shelter during an air raid alert. Despite a Russian strike nearby, their focus wasn&apos;t on relocation but on building a new logistics center in the country. A year later, their determination paid off &#x2014; built from scratch, a new 22-million-euro facility was a symbol of resilience and trust. At the onset of the invasion, some claimed no one would invest in a country at war. They were wrong. Most regions are now relatively safe for business, with robust investor support programs driving steady Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) growth ($4.2 billion in 2023 and $3.5 billion in the first 10 months of 2024). Despite a significant portion coming from reinvestments, new investments are also on the rise. Today, Ukraine&apos;s primary investors are domestic companies and investors committed to the country&apos;s future. Despite the war, they continue launching new products and expanding their reach to new markets in sectors such as agriculture, construction, logistics, energy, machine industry, and pharmaceuticals. Lifecell signboard is visible on the facade of the building in Lviv, Ukraine on Dec. 15, 2023. (Mykola Tys/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Foreign companies are cautiously following suit. Unilever is building new production facilities, Azerbaijan&apos;s NEQSOL Holding acquired Ukraine&apos;s largest titanium production company through major privatization efforts, and Austrian Kronospan has built a new production line in Rivne. A standout business case is French investor Xavier Niel&apos;s $600-million acquisition of a Ukrainian telecom provider &#x2014; the largest deal since the start of the full-scale invasion. Even before 2022, such deals were rare. Those who recognize the opportunities today can already reap the benefits. So, what does Ukraine offer? Several tools are in place for those looking to establish production in Ukraine. Among the most effective ones are industrial parks. Currently, 25 industrial enterprises are operating or being built in these parks, including branches of foreign companies, spanning sectors like agro-processing, woodworking, and machinery. In 2024, Ukraine allocated around 1 billion hryvnias ($25 million) in state support to develop industrial infrastructure in 15 industrial parks. Manufacturers operating in these zones benefit from tax and customs incentives. Access to finance is facilitated through the 5-7-9% Affordable Loans Program, which has been refocused on investment goals. The program now includes financing energy equipment as well. Additionally, the Significant Investments Program is now operational. Businesses investing at least 12 million euros can qualify for up to 30% compensation through tax and customs benefits and other forms of state support. The first agreements under this program have already been signed. Ukraine is also attracting investments with our partners&apos; support. The 50-billion-euro Ukraine Facility program by the European Commission includes an investment component, the Ukraine Investment Framework (UIF), worth 9.3 billion euros. This mechanism combines European Commission guarantees, grants, and technical assistance combined with other financial tools available in Ukraine. We anticipate this initiative will draw up to 40 billion euros over the next few years, with each euro of guarantees potentially attracting an additional 2&#x2013;4 euros in investments.

(Diego Fedele/Getty Images)The first 1.4 billion euros under the UIF is already accessible in the form of guarantees, financing, grants, and technical assistance. These funds are channeled through programs of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), European Investment Bank (EIB), International Finance Corporation (IFC), German Development Bank (KfW), European Fund for Southeast Europe (EFSE), and Polish National Development Bank (BGK). Both Ukrainian and foreign businesses can submit their projects to these institutions or partner banks in Ukraine to apply for financing. Next year, the European Commission is expected to announce additional programs totaling approximately 3 billion euros for public sector projects. It plans to introduce direct financing for the corporate sector and investments in private equity through private equity funds. Currently, international financial institutions and the European Commission are in the process of selecting projects eligible for funding. A detailed handbook provides step-by-step guidance for businesses on how to submit applications. We aim to make investing as transparent as possible, so the government has developed digital databases of public and private projects. For the first time in history, the government has created a Single Project Pipeline comprising 787 public investment projects. Some of them are already funded by the state budget, some by international financial institutions. For projects that require further refinement, we will establish a Project Preparation Facility in 2025. For example, if a community requires investment for reconstruction but cannot prepare a bankable project, this facility will provide support. Requests for assistance will need to be submitted through the DREAM system. Moving from public to private sector projects, proposals from businesses are consolidated on the Investment Portal. Its 126 projects worth $28.9 billion in key sectors such as agricultural processing, transportation and logistics, energy, green transition, critical materials, manufacturing, IT, and digitalization. We&apos;re also exploring the launch of a similar Project Preparation Facility to help the private sector develop business projects in strategic sectors. Pending legislative changes aim to improve public-private partnerships (PPPs) in Ukraine. A draft law currently awaiting a vote would simplify the process of attracting private capital, enable the combination of private and donor grant financing, and offer stronger guarantees for investors, aligning PPP procedures with EU standards. Preparations are underway for concession projects at the Chornomorsk port and pilot healthcare PPPs. If the law is approved in 2025, the first tenders for private partners could be announced immediately. The year 2024 marked a milestone for Ukraine&apos;s privatization efforts. Iconic assets like the Hotel Ukraine, the titanium producer United Mining and Chemical Company, and the first sanctioned asset, the Aeroc Plant, found new owners. Loss-making state enterprises now have an opportunity to revive, while sanctioned assets, once security threats, will become engines of national recovery. As a result, privatization revenues reached nearly 12 billion hryvnias (nearly $300 million) &#x2014; triple the original target for 2024.

This is why developing a robust insurance infrastructure is a priority. This year, Ukraine&apos;s Export Credit Agency began offering war insurance for export-oriented manufacturers, and the first contracts have been signed. We&apos;ve also launched the Unity mechanism to insure vessels traveling to and from Ukraine through the Black Sea corridor, while the EBRD introduced long-awaited cargo insurance. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation expanded its tools, enabling small and medium businesses to secure insurance through Ukrainian reinsurers. Additionally, successful projects have been implemented with the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). Looking ahead, we&apos;re working with the National Bank on legislation to establish a comprehensive state-backed war risk insurance system for both individuals and businesses. War doesn&apos;t put a cap on investment. Nearly three years of the full-scale war have proven that despite all, investors are willing to see Ukraine as a destination for their capital. Following the construction of a new logistics center, the Austrian investor launched a new 200 million euro chipboard production line in Rivne.	https://kyivindependent.com/they-said-no-one-would-invest-in-a-country-at-war-they-were-wrong/	2025-01-06T08:34:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2182512939.jpg
‘We are in a year like 1938’ – Estonian foreign minister on a crucial time for Ukraine and Europe	As Ukraine and Europe enter 2025 with a worsening situation on the battlefield and the incoming Trump administration hoping to quickly reach some kind of peace in Russia&#x2019;s all-out war, the first months of the year look to be fundamental in deciding the outcome of the war. While much will be decided on the battlefield, the race is on for Western countries to come together and find the strongest and most united position in Ukraine, but many of the biggest players continue to hold back. &#xA0; Since Trump&#x2019;s re-election, discussions have been reported between several countries on the topic of braver support for Ukraine, including placing foreign troops inside Ukrainian territory; though no public decisions have been made. Not long after Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna called for the West to look into &#x201C;boots on the ground&#x201D; options of securing Ukrainian-controlled territory from a repeat Russian invasion after a peace deal, the Kyiv Independent spoke to the minister in Tallinn. This conversation is part of a series of interviews with decision-makers in the Nordic and Baltic countries conducted during the European screening tour of the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s documentary film &#x201C;Can You Hear Me? The invisible battles of Ukrainian military medics.&#x201D; Editor&#x2019;s note: The transcript of this interview has been edited for length and clarity. The Kyiv Independent: From the Estonian perspective, how decisive is this moment in time for Ukraine and the next few months for Ukraine and for the security of Europe as a whole? Margus Tsahkna: On Feb. 24 (2022), (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&apos;s plan was to take over (Kyiv) within a couple of days, and he did not succeed. We have to remember that Ukraine has been very successful. We always talk about how now peace must be done and wrap it up, and also that Ukraine is in a bad position. But, actually, Ukraine has been able to fight back. Europe has been waking up. I was the defense minister in 2016-17, and I see the total difference in Europe (compared to then). We have realized two things. One is that Russia is an aggressive country and it will remain a threat for Europe, not only for Ukraine. Secondly, that we can fight back. It is very important that this change of mentality is there. And now, of course, the situation is very complicated, there are more and more talks about peace. But what is the meaning of peace? Who is winning? Who is losing? Of course, Putin is putting the narrative very actively on the table that he&apos;s winning, he&apos;s gaining more territories. For Ukraine, it&apos;s really, really complicated to fight back, we understand this. From an Estonian perspective, we advocate and we ask everybody to give more, especially in defense and military support. Honestly, we all want peace, most Ukrainians want peace. But the peace must be just and long-lasting. One thing we don&apos;t see is actually Putin wanting peace. You cannot weaken your positions by talking about peace when the other side is actually committing this aggression, and not showing any willingness to change the goal. The goal for Putin was not to gain more territories. The goal was actually to take down the Ukrainian democratic government &#x2013; he has said publicly that such a nation as Ukraine does not exist. This is the goal, and I don&apos;t see that it has changed at all. So I&apos;m advocating to our allies publicly that we need to understand that any kind of ceasefire is not peace. Any kind of peace without security guarantees is not actually peace. And there cannot be a peace process without Ukraine, it&apos;s impossible. We need to make Ukraine&apos;s position stronger. Of course, there is a player entering now in the middle of January to the White House, (U.S. President-elect) Donald Trump. He is listening pretty carefully to what we have said and what we are saying, meeting different leaders of European countries. We just need to put the arguments on the table because I don&#x2019;t think that President Trump is interested in a weak ceasefire because then Russia will remain a threat.

Fallon /AFP via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: In your discussions with partners, how close are we, do you think, to a real unified understanding that peace must come with hard deterrence against a repeat invasion? Margus Tsahkna: I see the change that countries understand that Russia will remain a threat to Europe, it&apos;s there. More and more, different nations and governments are talking about what more we can do. We have increased our defense investments. Not all of us, mainly the bordering (with Russia) countries and the Nordic countries. But still, too many countries are thinking that maybe business as usual can come back, that let&apos;s have peace and maybe normal life will return. It will not. We have also seen that for countries neighboring Russia, a &#x201C;neutral&#x201D; position is just a green light for Putin. And we need to understand as well that Putin is not a leader of the country who is taking care of his nation. He has built up a regime of terror, of fear, around the idea of restoring the empire. He is an old man, and he knows that he is fighting for his life. So it is not so easy for him to stop this war machine he has built up. It is based on fear in their own society. It is based on a war economy. The war is the basic core his power is relying on. It is not easy anymore to stop it without using force or without fighting against this aggression. And Ukrainians, you are doing that. Not us. The Kyiv Independent: Just recently, we&#x2019;ve seen top Russian representatives say that there will be no freezing of the conflict. Do you think that we should take what they&apos;re saying at face value, that they simply do not plan to stop? Or are they positioning themselves for negotiations with the highest possible demands? Margus Tsahkna: Of course, Russia is positioning. Putin is afraid of President Trump&apos;s incoming administration, and Russia is not so secure on the resources front. North Korean troops are there, of course, but Russia also is relying on North Korean ammunition, Iranian drones, and economic support from China. With this talk, they are trying to strengthen their position. But we don&apos;t have to believe that. This peace and just peace will be made on the battlefield, so we need to focus on how we can make Ukraine&#x2019;s position stronger. If President (Volodymyr) Zelensky feels that all the Western partners are just pushing him to a peace deal, it&apos;s not a very strong position. I totally agree with the European Union&#x2019;s high representative of foreign policy (former Estonian Prime Minister) Kaja Kallas, who said we shouldn&#x2019;t push Ukraine to peace talks if we see that Putin has not changed his goal. The Kyiv Independent: Zelensky has said in several interviews that Ukraine would be ready to stop the war on their side if it was in exchange for NATO membership, but this is firmly opposed by some of the biggest players in NATO. Does Estonia agree that NATO membership is the only option, and if there are other options, what could they be? Margus Tsahkna: The main question is that if there is a post-war situation, how can we give Ukraine solid security guarantees? With Putin, we know that these must be military security guarantees. We had the Minsk agreements, and Ukraine signed &#x201C;security guarantees&#x201D; in 1994 (Budapest Memorandum), and they were not security guarantees. From an Estonian perspective, we are not only talking about Ukraine: We are talking about the European, regional security guarantees, and Ukraine is part of that. What are these security guarantees in real life? Are they peacekeeping missions, military missions? Our point is very clear: NATO membership for Ukraine is the most secure, most clear, most efficient, and cheapest way to give real security guarantees. Any other structure is much more complicated. We have examples from the past as West Germany was taken into NATO when the East part was actually occupied. It&apos;s a matter of political will. But the honest thing is as well, we don&apos;t exactly know President Trump&#x2019;s position, and what the official plan will be. So we need to use this time first to support Ukraine because we are not only securing the situation in Ukraine, we are securing Europe. We are in a year like 1938 in Europe, just before the Munich meeting when Prime Minister (Neville) Chamberlain went back to Great Britain and showed the white paper and said now the peace is here. We can go back home and say that we brought peace, but if it is a Chamberlain peace, it will be the start of more and more aggression. Now, we have every opportunity to avoid everything that came after 1938: World War II. This is not only about Europe, it is about the world order. The UN Charter is meant to uphold this order, and if it doesn&apos;t work, if it&apos;s not able now to support Ukraine and forge the kind of peace that is just and long-lasting, then this system may collapse, and it affects everybody.

(Alexander Welscher / Picture alliance via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: You have made headlines a few times by being the first major high-level state representative to openly call for the boots-on-the-ground idea to be looked at seriously. Could you share something about how you imagine that working, especially if Russia is interested in invading again? Margus Tsahkna: Of course, it is unclear, because what we are witnessing right now is full aggression. Russia is more aggressive than at any time during the last two and a half years, especially now with the North Korean troops there. This makes this conflict or this aggression totally different already on the political and global level. The other thing is that there are no peace talks right now, we don&apos;t see that Putin would like to have any kind of peace. It&apos;s very hard to imagine what kind of security guarantees without NATO membership can be there, but there must be a real backup system for the deal, whatever it ends up being. This is the right time to discuss readiness, what one country or another is ready to do. Of course, this cannot be done without the U.S., without the big countries, but it&apos;s too early to share because it&apos;s just in the beginning and we have many preconditions that are not there yet. The Kyiv Independent: Is there a scenario where European countries, those who have the same clarity as Estonia, Poland, and others, are compelled to take maybe braver steps even without the US? Margus Tsahkna: I understand your concern. I was defense minister when Trump first entered the White House, and there was a lot of speculation about what would happen. In the end, we gained more troops on the ground, more military and financial support because of the regional security situation. The honest answer is, we don&apos;t know yet what will be Trump&apos;s plan or proposition. We&apos;re using this time to explain, to put arguments on the table. This is not an isolated problem. It is all connected. It&apos;s all connected with Iran, with China. China will probably be at the center of President Trump&apos;s foreign policy. So this is all connected. Many people have said many things during their political campaigns, but what counts is what will really happen. I&apos;m not going to speculate about what could be with or without the U.S. Our security in Europe is connected to the U.S. and the other way around, our economies are very much connected. This is a global square, and Ukraine is playing a very crucial role, so let&apos;s do things in the right order. Our duty, as well as that of Ukraine&#x2019;s leaders, is to explain. The Kyiv Independent: You mention that the most important thing is improving Ukraine&apos;s position on the battlefield. But from the Ukrainian perspective, the feeling is that the status quo is not working, especially because Ukraine&apos;s ability to stay in the war is also limited by manpower. Are there other asymmetrical political measures that braver European countries could take to show Putin that the West does not plan in any way to abandon Ukraine? Margus Tsahkna: We have had (French) President (Emmanuel) Macron&#x2019;s initiatives (floating the idea of French troops in Ukraine). These opportunities are all there: for example, training missions and many other things. But I believe the most sustainable for the long run idea is to invest heavily in Ukraine, in its defense industry, technological capabilities, and so on. We need to give what Ukrainians are asking for, and Ukraine is not asking for boots on the ground to go to the battlefield, because maybe it&apos;s not even a smart idea. These are complicated times. We have elections in Germany, we have President Trump entering the White House with all the rhetoric that we have heard. Of course, Putin is using this opportunity, because he has only one voice, but we have many different voices. I cannot even personally imagine the situation that you as a nation and those people on the front are going through. It&apos;s hard for us Estonians to come back so often from different meetings with no decisions, then meeting our Ukrainian friends and explaining that, yes, we want to do more, but somehow we are not able to. If we had given everything that we have within the last two and a half years straight away, Russia would already have been pushed back to Russia. There is fear in the Western part of the world about what happens if Putin loses. I remember once the same fear, of what if the Soviet Union collapses. This fear of Putin&apos;s collapse is actually stopping many, many decisions. We need to keep pushing. The Kyiv Independent: If they are afraid of Russia losing, do you think something needs to get much worse before the West sees the threat of Ukraine losing, to finally make that final step to wake up? Margus Tsahkna: We have witnessed from the past what happens if Putin has an opportunity to continue, and he will continue anyway. I really hope that we don&apos;t need the years 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943 to finally understand that we could have a different situation. That&apos;s why I&apos;m bringing this parallel with the Munich meeting in 1938. But I&apos;m actually more positive that we can support Ukraine based on the understanding that Ukrainians are not fighting only for themselves and for us, but instead of us. I can say it as a former defense minister, because we saw in 2016-17, on the other side of our borders, 120,000 troops ready to go within 48 hours. These troops do not exist anymore. They were sent to Ukraine. They are dead. So that&apos;s why I&apos;m saying that you are fighting instead of us, and this knowledge is finally pretty widespread.	https://kyivindependent.com/estonian-foreign-minister-on-a-crucial-time-for-ukraine-and-europe/	2025-01-06T08:25:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/2G9A5189-004_00_08_41_13_Still005.jpg
End of Ukraine gas transit has no effect on EU energy market stability, European Commission says	The EU energy market remains stable following the end of the Russian gas transit through Ukraine, European Commission spokesperson Anna-Kaisa Itkonen said at a briefing in Brussels on Jan. 6. Ukraine terminated Russian natural gas transit through its territory on Jan. 1. Kyiv has repeatedly warned that it would not extend the agreement when it expires at the end of 2024 because it did not want to finance Russia&apos;s war. &quot;We have been working intensely for over a year with our member states and with Ukraine as well to prepare in advance for this scenario,&quot; the spokesperson said. When asked about whether such a move caused any kind of emergency in Slovakia, she said that the Gas Coordination Group held talks last week and concluded that &quot;there are no security supplies issues or concerns for the European Union following the end of the transit.&quot; &quot;The markets had already factored in at the end of transit agreement. And we have not seen price spikes in the new year,&quot; Itkonen added. While the EU has made efforts to reduce dependency on Russian fossil fuels following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many countries remain reliant on Russian gas. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his Slovak counterpart Robert Fico have been among some of the most vocal opponents of Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit. In his New Year&apos;s address, Fico said that stopping Russian gas transit through Ukraine would have &quot;radical consequences&quot; for everyone in the European Union, but not for Russia. Fico &#xA0;claimed that gas and electricity prices in Europe would rise. Fico previously threatened to cut off electricity supplies to Ukraine amid increasing blackouts due to Russian attacks targeting Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/end-of-ukraine-gas-transit-deal-has-no-effect-on-eu-energy-market-stability-european-commission-says/	2025-01-06T08:21:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1247343791.jpg
Engine failures ground two Russian airliners shortly after takeoff, local media reports	Two Russian airliners were forced to return to their departure airports due to engine failures shortly after takeoff, The Moscow Times reported on Jan. 4, citing Russian media. Western sanctions imposed after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine have severely impacted the country&#x2019;s aviation industry. Cut off from parts and support from Western manufacturers, Russian airlines have struggled to maintain aircraft. An Airbus A321neo operated by Ural Airlines experienced a left engine failure at an altitude of 4,500 meters (2.7 miles) on Jan. 4 while flying from Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, to Yekaterinburg. The crew reported the malfunction and returned to the departure airport. Similarly, a Boeing 737 belonging to NordStar Airlines suffered a left engine failure at 11,300 meters (7 miles) during a flight from Volgograd to Ekaterinburg on Jan. 2, prompting its crew to return to Gumrak airport in Volgograd. The airlines confirmed that both planes have been grounded for technical inspections and condition assessments. According to Russia&apos;s Izvestia newspaper, as of Nov. 13, about 30 Russian airlines &#x2014; accounting for 26% of domestic passenger traffic &#x2014; face potential bankruptcy in 2025 due to accumulated debts and difficulties leasing foreign aircraft. In the meantime, Russia has struggled to reduce its reliance on foreign-made passenger jets, as seen in a deadly crash in July 2024. A domestically-produced Sukhoi Superjet 100 crashed in a forest near Moscow during a test flight following scheduled maintenance, killing all three crew members on board, state-controlled TASS news agency reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/engine-failures-ground-two-russian-airliners-shortly-after-takeoff-the-moscow-times-reports/	2025-01-06T07:36:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-537791492.jpg
Absurd versions' — Azerbaijan's president accuses Russia, condemns Putin’s denial of involvement in plane crash	Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev again accused Russia of causing the Dec. 25 crash of Airlines Flight J2-8243, which killed 38 people, and criticized Vladimir Putin for not admitting guilt during a Jan. 6 meeting with victims&#x2019; families and surviving crew members. The flight, en route from Baku to Grozny, Chechnya, changed course and crashed in Kazakhstan. Multiple reports and official Azerbaijani statements attributed the disaster to a missile launched by a Russian Pantsir-S air defense system. &quot;The blame for this disaster lies with representatives of the Russian Federation,&quot; he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has maintained close ties with Azerbaijan, offered condolences during a Dec. 28 phone call but stopped short of admitting Russian responsibility. Aliyev criticized Russia&#x2019;s handling of the incident, accusing its agencies of suppressing evidence and promoting &quot;absurd versions&quot; of events. Aliyev also blamed Russia for failing to close its airspace near Grozny and highlighted poor coordination between its military and civil aviation services as factors contributing to the tragedy. Aliyev said the plane&#x2019;s black boxes were decoded in Brazil at Azerbaijan&#x2019;s insistence, bypassing the Interstate Aviation Committee due to doubts about its objectivity. Flight J2-8243 carried 67 passengers, including 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russians, six Kazakhs, and three Kyrgyz citizens. Official Azerbaijani sources confirmed that the missile responsible originated from Russian forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/absurd-versions-azerbaijans-president-accuses-russia-condemns-putins-denial-in-crash-case/	2025-01-06T07:03:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2166759797.jpg
SBU behind drone attack on one of Russia's largest sea trade ports in Leningrad Oblast, source claims	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) conducted a drone attack on one of Russia&apos;s largest commercial seaports, Ust-Luga, in Leningrad Oblast on Jan. 4, an intelligence source told The Kyiv Independent on Jan. 6. According to the source, Ukrainian long-range drones flew over 900 kilometers (559 miles) and almost reached St. Petersburg. The source shared a video purporting to show one of the drones hitting gas condensate tanks. One tank was heavily damaged, and three others suffered damage from explosive debris, they added. Experts suggest that it will take at least a month to repair the facility and will lead to interruptions in the terminal&apos;s operations. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage purporting to show Ukrainian drones attack Russia&apos;s largest commercial seaport, Ust-Luga, in Leningrad Oblast on Jan. 4, 2025. (SBU source)&quot;The Ust-Luga terminal is a major logistics hub in the Baltic Sea. &#xA0;Russia sells oil and gas via it with the help of the &apos;shadow fleet.&apos; Drone sanctions from the SBU reduce the flow of currency that Russia needs to wage war,&quot; the source said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The Jan. 4 attack on the Russian port in Leningrad Oblast is not the first attack of its kind. On Jan. 24, 2024, Novatek&apos;s gas-condensate plant caught fire at the port of Ust-Luga following a possible coordinated effort by Ukraine to strike key targets deep inside Russian territory. The Ust-Luga Commercial Seaport began operations in December 2001 with the opening of a coal terminal. In the early 2020s, it became one of the largest seaports in Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-behind-drone-attack-on/	2025-01-06T06:43:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/--------------2025-01-06-163358.png
Russian troops allegedly kill 3 Ukrainian POWs in Donetsk Oblast	Russian troops have allegedly killed three Ukrainian prisoners of war in the southwest of Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine&#x2019;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets wrote on his Telegram channel on Jan. 6. According to DeepState, a crowd-sourced information-gathering website on Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, Russian forces tied the soldiers&apos; hands and shot them in the back of the head. &quot;We are once again witnessing atrocities that demonstrate Russia&apos;s true face,&quot; the ombudsman said. Reports of murders, torture, and ill-treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war are received regularly by Ukrainian authorities and have spiked in recent months. Most cases were recorded in the embattled Donetsk Oblast. &quot;On Jan. 3, near the village of Neskuchne, Volnovakha district, Donetsk Oblast, Russian soldiers committed a heinous crime &#x2014; they allegedly shot three Ukrainian prisoners of war,&quot; Lubinets said. The ombudsman added he would immediately appeal to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations. Russian forces have summarily executed 109 Ukrainian POWs in 2024 alone, Lubinets said in December. Executing prisoners of war is a gross violation of the Geneva Conventions.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-allegedly-kill-3-ukrainian-pows-in-donetsk-oblast/	2025-01-06T06:29:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2153450598.jpg

Ukraine strikes 3 Russian air defense systems in single day, Navy claims	Two Russian anti-missile Pantsir-S1 systems and one OSA anti-aircraft vehicle were damaged or destroyed by Ukraine&apos;s Navy in one day, the military branch claimed on Jan. 6. &quot;Our soldiers continue to turn Russian equipment into scrap metal,&quot; Ukrainian Navy Commander Oleksii Neizhpapa said in a Facebook post referring to the three successful attacks. In his post, Neizhpapa shared a video apparently depicting a drone zeroing in on a Russian Pantsir-S1 vehicle, claiming that the two Pantsir-S1 were destroyed in the occupied territory of Ukraine&#x2019;s Kherson Oblast. A Pantsir S-1 has an estimated price tag of around $15 million. One such system is suspected to be behind the mistaken downing of an Azerbaijani plane on Dec. 25, according to the media. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video that purports to show a Ukrainian strike against a Russian Pantsir air defense system. Footage published on Jan. 6, 2024. (Ukraine&apos;s Navy/Telegram)Developed in the Soviet Union in the 1960s, the 9K33 Osa (SA-8 Gecko according to NATO terminology) is a highly mobile, short-range, low-altitude surface-to-air missile system still in use by Russia, Ukraine, and a dozen other countries. The Osa has been used with great effect by the Russian Armed Forces against Ukrainian drones, with some experts linking it to Ukraine scaling down the use of its once-popular Bayraktar drones. The system functions as an all-in-one transporter erector launcher and radar (TELAR) vehicle that can detect and attack enemy targets independently. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the Navy&apos;s claims nor the extent of the damage done to the Russian anti-aircraft and anti-missile systems. Russia has lost 1,034 air defense systems since the full-scale invasion began, Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces reported before the news of the three successful hits surfaced.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-3-russian-air-defense-systems-in-single-day-navy-claims/	2025-01-06T06:05:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Picture1.png
Lukashenko's spox denies apology to Zelensky for Belarus's involvement in Russia's war	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko did not apologize to President Volodymyr Zelensky for Belarus&apos;s involvement in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Lukashenko&apos;s spokesperson Natalia Eismont told RBC news agency on Jan. 6. Her claims came after Zelensky said in an interview with American podcaster Lex Fridman that Lukashenko apologized for Minsk&apos;s involvement in the war shortly after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in February 2022. &quot;No apologies have been made by the Belarusian president to Zelensky, for the simple reason that we have nothing to apologize for,&quot; Eismont said. According to the spokesperson, Lukashenko and Zelensky held a phone call due to the &quot;emotional reaction&quot; of Lukashenko&apos;s son Nikolai, who had the number of Ukraine&apos;s president. Lukashenko said that Zelensky would be &quot;responsible for the deaths of people&quot; and urged him to negotiate with Russia, Eismont claimed. Zelensky also said that Lukashenko proposed Kyiv to strike the Mozyr oil refinery in Belarus. Eismont did not comment on these claims. While Belarus, an ally of Russia, has not directly participated in the war, it has allowed the Kremlin to use its territory as a staging ground for its operations against Ukraine. The country is also reportedly hosting Russian tactical nuclear arms on its territory. Russian troops operated a torture chamber in the Belarusian town of Naroulia in the spring of 2022, the Belarusian Investigative Center (BIC) reported in late November. Ukrainian prisoners of war and civilians abducted from Ukraine were reportedly held there.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenkos-spox-denies-he-apologized-to-zelensky-for-belarus-involvement-in-war/	2025-01-06T05:59:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184329199.jpg
Macron sees no 'quick and easy solution' to Ukraine, urges 'realistic' discussions on territory	French President Emmanuel Macron on Jan. 6 called on Ukraine to have &quot;realistic discussions on territorial issues&quot; as they alone can conduct them. &quot;There will be no quick and easy solution in Ukraine,&quot; Macron said in an address to French ambassadors in the Elysee Palace. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has previously vowed to bring both sides to the negotiating table and swiftly end the war. &quot;The U.S. must help us to change the nature of the situation and convince Russia to come to the negotiating table,&quot; Macron said in comments quoted by France24. Russia currently occupies around 20% of Ukrainian territory. President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged that Ukraine&apos;s military currently lacks the strength to retake all of it by force, noting that some regions, like Crimea, will have to be liberated through diplomatic means. In his address, the French head of state warned of repercussions for Europe and the U.S. should Ukraine emerge from the war on the losing side. &quot;The new American president himself knows that the U.S. has no chance of winning anything if Ukraine loses,&quot; Macron said. France&apos;s president also said that it would be up to European countries to &quot;build security guarantees&quot; for Ukraine, a statement in line with his calls for greater European strategic autonomy. Paris has spearheaded the idea of deploying European peacekeepers to Ukraine after a possible ceasefire deal is reached. Trump, who vowed to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the conflict, has reportedly backed the idea, while Russia has rejected it. Trump&apos;s imminent return to the White House, Ukraine&apos;s military setbacks, and Russia&apos;s growing economic difficulties have contributed to expectations of possible peace talks in 2025. Kyiv&apos;s allies have said they seek to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position for any possible negotiations, with German government saying on Jan. 6 that peace cannot be &quot;dictated&quot; from Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-on-talks-in-ukraine/	2025-01-06T05:37:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2033880055.jpg
Russia seeks to restore barge barriers protecting Crimean Bridge lost due to storms, Navy says	Russia is attempting to deploy new barge barriers near the Kerch Bridge in occupied Crimea instead of the destroyed ones, Dmytro Pletenchuk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Navy, said on Jan. 6. The barriers form part of a network of measures, both on land and sea, set up by Moscow to protect the bridge after multiple successful Ukrainian attacks. Speaking on national television, Pletenchuk confirmed that they were damaged due to storms in the Black Sea. &quot;Still, of course, they (Russia) are taking maximum measures to protect this illegal construction (the Crimean Bridge),&quot; Pletenchuk said. &quot;And so far, there are no tendencies to reduce their activity.&quot; The bridge is also equipped with layered air defense systems, he added. The 19-kilometer-long (12 miles) Crimean Bridge, constructed following Russia&#x2019;s illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014 and completed in 2018, serves as a vital supply route for Russian forces. The bridge has been targeted by Ukraine multiple times, suffering heavy damage in strikes in October 2022 and July 2023. The Crimean Bridge remains a focal point of the conflict and is also the subject of a legal dispute between Ukraine and Russia at the Permanent Court of Arbitration.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-seeks-to-restore-barge-barriers-near-crimean-bridge-lost-due-to-storm-navy-says/	2025-01-06T05:23:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1243812201.jpg
Russian agents plotted terror attack near Kyiv by blowing up 16-year-old co-conspirator, SBU claims	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) uncovered a group of Russian agents who planned to carry out a mass terror attack involving a 16-year-old boy against a Ukrainian military unit in Kyiv Oblast, the SBU claimed on Jan. 6. The boy, disguised as a soldier, was allegedly instructed to plant explosives at an entrance to a military facility premises in December 2024. The plotters then intended to detonate the explosives remotely, killing the boy as well, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said, adding that the boy was not aware he was to be killed as part of the attack. Russia has been repeatedly accused of recruiting underage Ukrainians for sabotage operations against the Ukrainian military across the country. The four suspects accused of involvement in the plot acted separately but under instructions of a single Russian handler, the SBU said. The weapons for the alleged terror attack had been previously manufactured by two residents of Vinnytsia Oblast. The boy arrived in Kyiv Oblast and settled in a hotel. According to the statement, he picked up a backpack with an explosive device and a military uniform left in a designated place. They were brought there earlier by another 19-year-old man, the SBU said. After changing his clothes, the minor arrived at the place and planted the explosives, which were disguised in the backpack, the SBU said. The counterintelligence agency reportedly uncovered the plot in advance and prevented the terror attack. All four suspects were detained. If charged, they can face life imprisonment with confiscation of property.	https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-uncovers-kyiv-oblast-terror-plot/	2025-01-06T04:54:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/0a9d0656fdd6e9503abfadc642f1b181.jpeg
Transnistria's electricity supply system faces collapse amid gas shortage, Moldovan official warns	The electricity supply system in the Russian-occupied Moldovan region of Transnistria is at risk of collapse after the halt of Russian gas flow, a high-ranking official of Moldova&#x2019;s Energy Ministry warned on Jan. 5. There is about a 65 megawatt (MW) growth in demand for electricity as residents of Transnistria use electric devices to heat their homes, said Constant Borosan, a state secretary at the ministry. &quot;This overloaded the networks and created a shortage of about 65 MW (megawatts) of electricity in the region.&quot; Russia&apos;s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom halted gas deliveries to Moldova on Jan. 1, citing alleged unpaid debts by Moldovagaz, Moldova&apos;s state-owned gas company. The halt of gas supplies resulted in a heating outage in Transnistria. While the rest of Moldova has switched to European energy supplies, the region, occupied by Russia since the early 1990s, is heavily dependent on Russian gas. Borosan said rolling blackouts began in the region, mainly during the peak consumption hours of morning and evening, to avoid overloading the energy grid. As Moldova&#x2019;s and Transnistria&#x2019;s energy grids are heavily interconnected, power should be saved in the government-controlled part of the country as well, the official added. Although a deal allowing Russian gas to transit through Ukraine expired on the same day that Russia halted gas supplies to Moldova, Gazprom insists the suspension is due to Moldova&apos;s outstanding debt, not transit issues. Moldovan officials dispute Gazprom&apos;s claims regarding outstanding payments, noting an international audit failed to verify the debts. Some 1,500 high-rise buildings in Transnistria were without heating and hot water on Jan. 4, and nearly 72,000 homes remained without gas, the region&#x2019;s leader said, urging residents to heat with stoves and fire amid dropping temperatures.	https://kyivindependent.com/transnistrias-electricity-supply-system-faces-collapse-moldovan-official-warns/	2025-01-06T04:15:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1686320111-1.jpg
Pro-government Slovak MPs to travel to Moscow to 'restore some relations'	A group of pro-government Slovak lawmakers plan to visit Moscow later in January to develop &quot;dialogue&quot; with Russia, according to Andrej Danko, the chair of the co-ruling far-right Slovak National Party (SNS) who will take part in the delegation, the Slovak news agency TASR reported on Jan. 5. Danko, a Russian-friendly nationalist who serves as the parliament deputy speaker, announced in early December his intent to visit Russia, weeks before Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Fico&apos;s Slovak government has been consistently critical of military support for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. More recently, Bratislava threatened Kyiv with cutting energy and humanitarian support after Ukraine did not prolong the transit deal on Russian gas flowing to Slovakia and other EU countries via Ukrainian pipelines. &quot;We want to understand certain positions, legislature, and restore some relations with Russia,&quot; Danko noted, presenting the trip as a continuation of Fico&apos;s visit on Dec. 22. The six-member delegation, which will include lawmakers from Danko&apos;s SNS and Fico&apos;s Smer (Direction) party, is expected to meet representatives of the Russian government and the parliament. &quot;We want to open the eyes of the people in Slovakia,&quot; Danko said, talking about the supposed importance of Russian gas and Russia&apos;s business ties with Western companies. Despite the EU&apos;s attempts at weaning itself off Russian fossil fuels in the wake of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, countries like Slovakia and Hungary remain heavily reliant on Russian gas. Fico was not the first Slovak official to visit Russia last year. Lubos Blaha, a pro-Kremlin member of the European Parliament for the Smer party, visited Moscow in October 2024, praising Russia as &quot;beautiful, wise, and advanced&quot; and calling for an end to hatred towards the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovak-mps-to-travel-to-moscow/	2025-01-06T03:45:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1204098217.jpg
Ukraine to receive another 180,000 rounds of ammunition for Gepard systems from Germany	Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry has ordered another 180,000 rounds of 35 mm ammunition for self-propelled Gepard anti-aircraft guns from the German Rheinmetall arms manufacturer, the company announced on Jan. 6. The order for a new batch of rounds of HEI-T ammunition (High Explosive Incendiary with Tracer) was booked in December 2024 and is funded by the German government. The start of delivery is expected in 2026, according to Rheinmetall. Berlin sent 55 Gepards to Ukraine, which had been decommissioned by Germany&apos;s Armed Forces. &quot;They have proven their value in air defense for more than two years,&quot; the statement read. The Gepard, a German-designed weapon first introduced into service in the 1970s, was designed for use against planes and helicopters. It is also seen as highly effective against drones, including the Shahed-type ones, which Russia uses in daily attacks against Ukraine. Initially criticized for its sluggish delivery of military aid to Ukraine following the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Berlin has become the second-largest provider of military equipment after the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-receive-another-180-000-rounds-of-ammunition-for-gepard-systems/	2025-01-06T03:28:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1556779740.jpg
‘They didn’t give a s**t’ — Zelensky rebukes those behind Budapest Memorandum	President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview published on Jan. 5 that those responsible for pressuring Kyiv to sign the Budapest Memorandum should be jailed, and signatory countries who gave security assurances &quot;didn&#x2019;t give a s**t&quot; about Ukraine. Speaking in the interview with American podcaster Lex Fridman, Zelensky said Ukraine tried multiple times to have the terms of the agreement enforced but received no responses. The Budapest Memorandum was signed on Dec. 5, 1994, and saw Ukraine sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and give up nuclear weapons left on its territory after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In exchange, Kyiv received security assurances from the U.S., the U.K., and Russia. China and France gave weaker assurances at the same time. All countries agreed to engage in varying levels of consultations in the event of Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity being threatened. Twenty years after signing the agreement, Russia launched a war against Ukraine, occupying Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine. Thirty years in, Russia is now actively conducting a full-scale offensive against Ukraine. In the interview with Fridman, Zelensky said Ukrainian officials requested consultations three times over several years from the start of Russia&#x2019;s aggression in 2014. &quot;Everyone should be in consultation. Everyone must come. Everyone must meet urgently, the U.S., Britain, Russia, France, China,&quot; he said. &quot;Did anyone come, you ask? No. Did anyone reply to these letters, official letters? They are all recorded by diplomats. Did anyone conduct consultations? &quot;No, and why not? They didn&#x2019;t give a s**t.&quot; Zelensky said Ukraine was pressured into signing the Budapest Memorandum, and those who came up with the agreement should be jailed. &quot;We were under the pressure of the U.S. and Russia for Ukraine to give up (nuclear weapons). These two powers were exerting pressure,&quot; he said. &quot;These two states negotiated to ensure that Ukraine does not have nuclear weapons. Ukraine agreed. Now we just need to find these people, and we just need to put in jail all of those who, frankly, invented all this.&quot; Last year marked the 30th anniversary of the signing of the Budapest Memorandum, an occasion Zelensky remarked on during his evening address on Dec. 5. &quot;Today marks 30 years of the Budapest Memorandum. Ten years of war. Not a single day did this document work,&quot; Zelensky said at the time. &quot;And because of this, everyone in the world will now know that a mere signature &#x2014; by any state &#x2014; or any assurances or promises are not enough for security.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-rebukes-budapest-memorandum-signatories/	2025-01-06T03:26:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190061070.jpg
Ukraine's military is 980,000 soldiers strong, Zelensky says	Ukraine has 980,000 people in arms as it fights Russia&apos;s all-out war, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with U.S. podcaster Lex Fridman published on Jan. 5. Zelensky presented Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces as the largest in Europe. This, however, excludes Russia, whose military personnel exceeded 1 million at the onset of the full-scale invasion, with Moscow aiming to raise this number to 1.5 million. &quot;The Ukrainian army is the largest in Europe. The second place after us (France) is four times smaller than us,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;I think the French have about 200,000. We have 980,000.&quot; Critics push for even more, as Ukraine&#x2019;s army has been on the back foot on the front line during 2024, partially due to a manpower shortage that analysts attributed to the country&#x2019;s demographics and a disjointed mobilization process. Ukraine lowered the mobilization age from 27 to 25 in April 2024 but resisted the international partners&apos; calls to further lower it to 18.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-military-is-980-000-soldiers-strong-zelensky-says/	2025-01-06T02:55:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1653684500.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure 21 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed two civilians and wounded 21 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 6. Overnight, the Russian military attacked Ukraine with two Kh-59 aerial missiles, as well as 128 Shahed-type drones and dummy drones, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported. The air defense shot down the two Kh-59 missiles as well as 79 drones over 11 oblasts, while 49 dummy drones were lost in the airspace, the Air Force said. One person was killed, and 13 others were injured as a result of the Russian military&#x2019;s attacks on the city of Kherson and 38 other regional settlements, Kherson Oblast Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on his Telegram channel. A man was killed, and a woman was injured in the Russian military&#x2019;s attack in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Governor Serhii Lysak reported on his Telegram channel. Seven people were also injured in Donetsk Oblast as a result of Russia&#x2019;s attacks, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on his Telegram channel.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-2-injure-21-over-past-day/	2025-01-06T02:17:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-06_10-21-31.jpg
Russia claims to capture Kurakhove, Ukraine says fighting ongoing in the sector	Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 6 that its forces had fully captured Kurakhove in Donetsk Oblast, a statement not confirmed by Ukraine. Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces reported on Jan. 6 that battles are ongoing in the Kurakhove sector as Russia &quot;conducts assault operations in the urban area of Kurakhove in the direction of Petropavlivka and Dachne.&quot; The reports come amid heavy Russian offensive operations in Donetsk Oblast that took a long-unseen pace in the fall of 2024. &quot;Measures are underway to identify and destroy Russian assault groups trying to infiltrate our battle formations,&quot; the Khortytsia group said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Russian forces have focused their effort at Kurakhove in southwestern Donetsk Oblast over the past few months, turning it into one of the hottest sectors of the front. The town lies over 20 kilometers (over 10 miles) north of Russian-occupied Vuhledar and over 30 kilometers (almost 20 miles) south of the key front-line town of Pokrovsk. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said on Jan. 6 that over the past day, Ukrainian forces repelled 27 ground assaults near Kurakhove, Petropavlivka, Dachne, and Slovianka. The Ukrainian monitoring group DeepState shows Kurakhove almost completely in Russian hands, with Moscow&apos;s forces apparently advancing west toward Dachne. If confirmed, this would make Kurakhove the first major town to fall into Russian hands in 2025 after capturing Avdiivka and Vuhledar last year. Moscow&apos;s troops now focus their efforts at Pokrovsk, an important logistics hub, as part of their overall goal to capture the entire Donetsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-to-capture-kurakhove/	2025-01-06T01:41:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187899885.jpg
Ukraine's position in Kursk Oblast important for possible negotiations, Blinken says	Outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Jan. 6 that Ukrainian positions in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast could play an important role in possible talks with Russia, the AFP news agency reported. The Biden administration, whose term expires in a few weeks, has sped up the delivery of military assistance to Ukraine to put Kyiv in the strongest possible position in potential peace negotiations. &quot;Their (Ukraine&apos;s) position in Kursk is an important one because certainly it&apos;s something that would factor in any negotiation that may come about in the coming year,&quot; Blinken told reporters in Seoul. The comments come at the heels of reports of Ukraine launching new offensive operations in Kursk Oblast after months of being on the defensive. Ukraine launched the cross-border incursion in early August, allegedly seizing 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian soil. Since then, Moscow has deployed reinforcements, including thousands of North Korean soldiers, and reportedly recaptured around half of the lost territory. President Volodymyr Zelensky also called the Kursk incursion an important &quot;trump card&quot; in any potential talks. There are growing expectations of possible peace talks in 2025 as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who will take office on Jan. 20, pledged to bring both sides to the negotiating table. Trump&apos;s return to the White House sparked concerns among Ukraine&apos;s allies due to the president-elect&apos;s past criticism of the Biden administration&apos;s support for Kyiv. In comments made since his reelection, Trump hinted at a possible reduction of U.S. assistance but said he would not &quot;abandon&quot; the country, instead aiming to leverage Washington&apos;s aid to push Russia to negotiate.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-positions-in-kursk-oblast-crucial-for-possible-negotiations-blinken-says/	2025-01-06T01:23:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2174582366.jpg
Ukraine has received less than half of US assistance allocated during full-scale war, Zelensky says	Ukraine has not received even half of the $177 billion the U.S. allocated to support Kyiv throughout the full-scale war, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with U.S. podcaster Lex Fridman released on Jan. 5. Zelensky implied that this development may have been linked to corruption or lobbying on the side of U.S. companies. Ukraine&apos;s head of state said this in response to Fridman&apos;s question about corruption concerns in Ukraine. The U.S. has become Ukraine&apos;s top supporter, providing the largest amount of military assistance to resist Russian aggression. Voices critical of Washington&apos;s support have often cited corruption risks and dangers of the illicit arms trade, though U.S. watchdogs have closely monitored the assistance. While acknowledging corruption in Ukraine, Zelensky said that his country works hard to combat it through the &quot;most complex&quot; anti-corruption system in Europe. He also said that what would be called &quot;corruption&quot; in Ukraine might be called &quot;lobbyism&quot; elsewhere. &quot;If we had $177 billion and if we get the half, where is the second half? If you find the second half, you will find corruption,&quot; Zelensky commented in the wide-ranging three-hour interview. Zelensky provided an example of him allegedly appealing to Washington to bring in U.S. arms using Ukraine&apos;s own fleet of cargo planes not to pay for the transport. &quot;No. I didn&apos;t get this opportunity. My jets stayed put, and the U.S. jets, cargo jets moved these weapons. But everywhere you have to spend money,&quot; Zelensky added, saying that Ukraine could have spent this money to buy more arms instead of paying for expensive transport to U.S. companies. &quot;Is this corruption or not? Or lobbyism?&quot; the president asked, saying that he has been reluctant to talk about such causes so as not to cause a scandal that could lead to the halt of aid. The president stressed that Ukraine does not profit from the war and that such claims stem from Russian propaganda, adding that Ukrainian authorities strictly punish anybody who attempts to profit from it. Ukraine has made strides to combat corruption since the EuroMaidan Revolution in 2014, but civil society groups and activists have raised the alarm about the anti-graft efforts slowing down during the full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-has-received-less-than-half-of-us-assistance-allocated-during-full-scale-war-zelensky-says/	2025-01-06T00:31:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178140389.jpg
US to introduce 'big package' of sanctions on Russia’s shadow fleet, individuals, Reuters reports	Outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration plans to introduce a &quot;big package&quot; of sanctions on Russia&#x2019;s shadow fleet and individuals, Reuters reported on Jan. 6, citing sources familiar with the matter. Despite Western efforts to reduce Russia&#x2019;s income from oil funding its war against Ukraine, Moscow has been able to bypass sanctions and sell Russian oil above the imposed price cap of $60 per barrel with the buildup of a fleet of aging vessels with dubious ownership. Washington&#x2019;s planned sanctions would aim at tankers carrying Russian oil above the imposed price cap and individuals working in schemes to sell crude above the cap, Reuters reported. &quot;It is going to be a big package,&quot; one of the sources was quoted as saying by the news agency. In a decision in late 2022, G7 countries, along with the EU and Australia, imposed rules on Western operators, permitting them to insure and transport Russian oil only if it is sold below the established threshold of $60 per barrel. That prompted Russia to redirect its flows to China and India, countries willing to purchase the oil above the cap, using hundreds of old tankers that also pose a grave environmental risk. The U.S. only sanctions a handful of them, Reuters reported. In a separate initiative, G7 countries discussed in late 2024 the possibility of lowering the price cap to $40 per barrel, but no consensus has been reached as projections show softening oil prices for 2025. Ukraine has also targeted Russia&apos;s oil infrastructure through drone strikes, further disrupting production. Several Russian refineries, including those in Tuapse, Ilyich, and Novoshakhtinsk, have reduced or suspended operations due to the combined impact of sanctions and Ukrainian attacks. The sector has been forced to sell fuel at a discount and operate under high interest rates, adding strain to its operations.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-introduce-big-package-of-sanctions-on-russias-shadow-fleet-individuals-reuters-reports/	2025-01-06T00:03:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1477537303.jpg
He's sending 18-year-old boys' to die — Zelensky says Putin doesn't love his country	Russian President Vladimir Putin does not love his country and people as he is sending Russia&apos;s youth to die in his wars of aggression, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with U.S. podcaster Lex Fridman released on Jan. 5. &quot;He does not love his people. He loves only his inner circle,&quot; Zelensky said in response to Fridman&apos;s suggestion that Putin is a &quot;serious person who loves his country.&quot; &quot;What is his country? He happened to consider Ukraine his country,&quot; the president responded in the three-hour-long interview, pointing out that Putin had previously also launched a destructive war against Chechnya, now a constituent republic of the Russian Federation. Putin rose to power during the Second Chechen War in 1999-2000, in which Russia forcibly subjugated the region and seized its capital, Grozny, after a devastating siege. &quot;Who are the Chechens? A different people: Another faith&#x2026; Another language. One million people eliminated&#x2026;. How did he kill them &#x2013; with love?&quot; Zelensky asked rhetorically. Ukraine&apos;s head of state also stressed that Russia&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine resulted in 780,000 of its soldiers killed or wounded, adding that Putin &quot;calls them all Russians, even those who don&apos;t know how to speak Russian, on his territory of Russia, everything they&apos;ve enslaved.&quot; &quot;He&apos;s (Putin) sending 18-year-boys (to die in war)... It&apos;s not that the fascists came to his country, and he needs to defend it. He came to ours, and he sends them,&quot; Zelensky continued, providing other examples of Moscow&apos;s wars and military interventions in Syria, Chechnya, Georgia, and Africa. Though the exact Russian losses in the full-scale invasion are difficult to establish with certainty, The Economist wrote that they already outpace Moscow&apos;s battlefield losses in all of its post-1945 wars combined.	https://kyivindependent.com/hes-sending-18-year-old-boys-to-die-zelensky-says-putin-doesnt-love-his-country/	2025-01-05T22:57:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187689001.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 798,040 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 798,040 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 6. This number includes 1,550 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,700 tanks, 20,164 armored fighting vehicles, 33,056 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,665 artillery systems, 1,258 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,034 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 21,625 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-798-040-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-05T22:53:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2003913401.jpg
Canadian PM Justin Trudeau expected to announce resignation in coming days, media reports	Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to announce his resignation as leader of the Liberal Party of Canada on or before Jan. 8, Canada&apos;s Globe and Mail reported on Jan. 5, citing three unnamed sources. It remains unclear if Trudeau will remain as prime minister on an interim basis as a new Liberal Party leader is selected, or whether he will step down immediately. Trudeau, who has faced slumping poll numbers over the past year, has faced increased pressure from Liberal Members of Parliament to resign following the abrupt resignation of Trudeau&apos;s finance minister, Chrystia Freeland. Freeland, who also served as deputy prime minister, resigned from the ministerial post on Dec. 16 after she was told by Trudeau that she would be replaced imminently. The decision drew heavy criticism from government MPs, with dozens of his parliamentary caucus members calling for his resignation. Trudeau, who has served as prime minister since 2015, is expected to resign ahead of his party&apos;s national caucus meeting on Wednesday, and may do so as early as Jan. 6, the Globe and Mail reported. Trudeau, who holds a minority government in Canada&apos;s parliament, lost a key partner in propping up the Liberal government in September, with the announcement by New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh that he would &quot;rip up&quot; a supply and confidence agreement with the government. Canada&apos;s next federal election is scheduled for October 2025, but will likely occur in the next few months as opposition parties have vowed to vote &quot;no confidence&quot; in the government during the next sitting of parliament which is scheduled to begin Jan. 27. Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre has consistently polled far ahead of Trudeau in public opinion polls and would likely win a majority government if an election were held today. Canada, under Trudeau, has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine providing 19.5 billion Canadian dollars ($13.5 billion) in assistance for Ukraine, including 4.5 billion Canadian dollars ($3.1 billion) in military aid. Freeland, who is of Ukrainian background and fluent in Ukrainian, served as the government&apos;s most vocal supporter of Ukraine. Previous to her career in politics, Freeland served as Moscow bureau chief for the Financial Times.	https://kyivindependent.com/canadian-pm-justin-trudeau-expected-announce-resignation-in-coming-days-media-reports-2/	2025-01-05T21:53:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1683460359.jpg
Lukashenko apologized to Zelensky for Belarus' role, denied responsibility early in Russia's invasion, Zelensky says	Shortly after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko apologized to President Volodymyr Zelensky over the country&apos;s involvement in the war, Zelensky revealed in an interview with American podcaster Lex Fridman published on Jan. 5. &quot;A few days into the war, I spoke with Lukashenko on the phone, and he apologized... he said, &apos;It was not me, missiles were launched from my territory, and (Russian President Vladimir) Putin was the one launching them.&apos; These are his words, I have witnesses,&quot; Zelensky said in his wide-ranging interview. &quot;&apos;And I apologize,&apos; he said. &apos;But believe me&apos; &#x2014; that&apos;s what he told me &#x2014; &apos;Volodya (referring to Volodymyr Zelensky), this is not me. I&#x2019;m not in charge,&apos;&quot; Zelensky added. In response, Zelensky said that he called Lukashenko &quot;a murderer,&quot; questioning why Lukashenko allowed Russia to launch missiles at Ukraine from Belarusian territory. Lukashenko became increasingly reliant on Russia after isolating Belarus from the West, following Belarus&apos; 2020 election. Lukashenko&apos;s opposition and the West condemned the results as fraudulent. Lukashenko cracked down on mass protests that broke out in response to the fraudulent election results. Since then, Belarusian authorities have increasingly suppressed political freedoms and have become complacent in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Despite not being directly involved in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Belarus continues to host Russian troops and missiles on its territory. Lukashenko asked Putin on Dec. 6 to deploy the Oreshnik missile systems in Belarus, a weapon Russia recently used to strike Ukraine, Russian state-controlled news agency RIA Novosti reported. As many as 10 missile systems will be deployed, according to pro-Kremlin journalist Alexander Yunashev. Belarus will be holding its next presidential election on Jan. 26 where Lukashenko is expected to be handed a seventh term in office.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-apologized-to-zelensky-for-russias-full-scale-invasion-zelensky-says/	2025-01-05T19:38:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1507107219.jpg
Zelensky offered to buy weapons from incoming Trump administration with frozen Russian assets	President Volodymyr Zelensky previously offered U.S. President-elect Donald Trump for Ukraine to buy American weapons at the expense of $300 billion in frozen Russian assets, Zelensky revealed in an interview with American podcaster Lex Fridman published on Jan. 5. &quot;This is one of the security guarantees. Take the money, what we need for our interior production, and we will buy all the weapons from the United States. We don&apos;t need gifts from the United States,&quot; Zelensky said in his wide-ranging interview with Fridman. &quot;It will be very good for your industry. For the United States. We will put money there. Russian money. Not Ukrainian. Not European. Russian money. Russian assets. They have to pay for this,&quot; Zelensky added. Zelensky did not comment on Trump&apos;s reaction to the suggestion. Trump and his team have been critical of U.S. spending to support Ukraine. Michael Waltz, Trump&apos;s appointed National Security Advisor for his upcoming term said on Dec. 15 that a &quot;blank check... just isn&apos;t a strategy.&quot; Despite previously criticizing U.S. aid for Ukraine, the Financial Times reported on Dec. 21, citing undisclosed sources, that Trump may not halt U.S. military support for Ukraine. Zelensky has taken steps to foster a positive relationship with Trump, despite previously having a fraught relationship stemming from Trump&#x2019;s 2019 impeachment trial. The two leaders met on Sept. 27 in the midst of the U.S. presidential election campaign. They met again on the sidelines of the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral, alongside French President Emmanuel Macron on Dec. 7. &quot;He (Trump) is strong... He is young... and his brains work,&quot; Zelensky said when asked why he thinks Trump won the U.S. presidential election in November. Zelensky previously said that the country must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means in 2025, adding that a war would &quot;end faster&quot; under a Trump administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-offers-to-buy-weapons-from-the-us-with-frozen-russian-assets/	2025-01-05T17:38:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2173922474.jpg
North Korean troops have sustained 3,800 casualties in Kursk Oblast, Zelensky says	A total of 3,800 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with American podcaster Lex Fridman on Jan. 5. Pyongyang sent upwards of 12,000 North Korean soldiers into Kursk Oblast in the fall of 2024, amid an agreement to help counter a surprise Ukrainian incursion into the region which began on Aug. 6. Ukrainian forces have been fighting to hold onto territory in the region ever since in hopes it can be used as a bargaining chip in future negotiations with Russia. Zelensky, in his wide-ranging interview with Lex Fridman, added that Pyongyang has the capabilities to bring additional North Korean troops to the front, as many as 30,000 -40,000 troops. Ukraine reportedly ramped up its operations in Kursk Oblast with a new offensive on Jan. 5, with mixed reports surfacing on outcome of the renewed push from Kyiv. The renewed offensive comes amid significant losses among Russian and North Korean forces during recent clashes, Zelensky said in his evening address on Jan. 4, citing information from Ukraine&apos;s top commander. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Dec. 27 that North Korean units had been carrying out &quot;human wave&quot; attacks against Ukrainian positions in Kursk Oblast, with little effect &#x2014; amounting to high casualty totals. Kirby added that North Korean soldiers have reportedly taken their own lives rather than surrender to Ukrainian troops, out of fear their families will be targeted over their capture. Ukraine and Russia are rushing to make up ground in Kursk Oblast before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes power on Jan. 2o. Trump has previously said he would end the war in &quot;24 hours&quot; with potential peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. U.S. officials told Bloomberg on Dec. 27 that they believe Ukraine may only have a few months left in its incursion into Kursk Oblast until Ukraine&apos;s military is forced to retreat from the region or risk being encircled by Russian forces. The comments come as Ukraine has steadily lost ground in the region amid Russian counterattacks. Ukraine has reportedly lost over 40% of territory it previously gained in due to renewed Russian efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/3800-north-korean-casualties-zelensky-says/	2025-01-05T15:30:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1734340818.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine launches new offensive in Russia's Kursk Oblast, mixed reports surface on outcome	Key developments on Jan. 4 - 5: Ukrainian troops attacked Russian forces in several directions in Kursk Oblast, Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s counter-disinformation center, claimed on Jan. 5. Reports by Russian pro-war Telegram channels have echoed the statement, saying that a new Kyiv offensive is underway. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, Russian troops repelled two offensives conducted by Ukrainian assault groups in Kursk Oblast on Jan. 5. The Kyiv Independent couldn&apos;t independently verify these claims at the time of publication. The reports come as Moscow has been ramping up its efforts to push Ukraine out of the embattled Kursk Oblast as Kyiv continues to hold on to a small piece of Russian territory in the hopes of gaining leverage in possible future negotiations. Roman Alyokhin, a Russian pro-war blogger and a former advisor to Kursk Oblast&apos;s governor, claimed that Kyiv launched an attack northeast of Sudzha toward the village of Bolshoye Soldatskoye, using armored vehicles and demining equipment. According to him, the Ukrainian army also &quot;intensified its actions&quot; in other areas of Kursk Oblast. Kovalenko said that Ukrainian troops attacked Russian forces in several directions in Kursk Oblast, which &quot;came as a surprise to them.&quot; &quot;Kursk Oblast, good news! Russia is getting what it deserves,&quot; Andrii Yermak, head of the President&apos;s Office, wrote on Telegram. The Ukrainian military has not publicly reported any new operations in Kursk Oblast. Acting Kursk Oblast Governor Alexander Khinshtein said on Jan. 5 that Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yunus-bek Yevkurov had arrived in Kursk. It was not immediately clear whether this visit was related to the ongoing activity in the region. Ukrainian forces launched an offensive in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in early August, achieving initial tactical success. In recent months, Ukraine has been on the back foot as Russia reportedly recaptured half of the lost territory and deployed reinforcements, including North Korean troops. The White House said on Dec. 27 that North Korean soldiers suffered over 1,000 casualties in Kursk Oblast over the past week alone as they carried out &quot;human wave&quot; assaults with little effect. Russia launched more than 300 drones and 20 missiles, including ballistic missiles, at Ukrainian cities and villages over the first three days of the new year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 3. In the first days of 2025, Russia carried out a series of attacks against Ukraine, causing the destruction of many residential buildings and infrastructure, as well as civilian casualties. Zelensky added that the Russian army also strikes settlements close to the front line with guided aerial bombs every day. &quot;Such Russian terror, which is not decreasing its intensity, requires us and all our partners to continue to build our air shield and all its systemic elements, from patriots to mobile fire groups,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;It is necessary to replenish the stock of anti-missiles for air defense constantly. We need to increase the capacity of mobile fire groups constantly. I am grateful to all the partners who help us.&quot; The president also announced meetings and talks next week to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s air defense. The next Ramstein-format summit of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) will take place on Jan. 9. The meeting will be the first since the leader-level summit in Germany was postponed in October 2024 after U.S. President Joe Biden canceled his foreign trips to handle Hurricane Milton. Russian troops are disguising themselves as civilians to bypass Ukrainian military positions in the Toretsk sector of the front line in Donetsk Oblast, commander of the mortar battery of the presidential brigade, call sign &quot;Mozok&quot; (&quot;Brain&quot;), told Suspilne on Jan. 3. The commander&apos;s statement comes after reports on Russian forces starting to move toward the town of Toretsk. Fighting with armored combat vehicles, motorcycles, and buggies took place in the village of Nelipivka, located south of Toretsk, in late December. The soldier, whose name is undisclosed for security reasons, said that after passing Ukrainian positions, Russian soldiers disguised as civilians either wait for reinforcements or use anti-tank mines to attack Ukrainian positions. &quot;Some of the soldiers are former prisoners. They are tasked with smuggling anti-tank mines and throwing them into the area of our firing positions when the fighters cannot be knocked out during regular battles. They are trying to blow up buildings where our guys are located,&quot; the soldier told Suspilne. Small infantry groups are also trying to storm and bypass positions under the cover of fog, he added. Toretsk has become one of the hottest spots in Donetsk Oblast in recent months as Russian troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in its defense of the front line. Apart from Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine expects Russian forces to launch larger-scale attacks in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. President Volodymyr Zelensky reported significant losses among Russian and North Korean forces during recent clashes in Russia&apos;s southern Kursk region. &quot;In battles yesterday and today near a single village, Makhnovka, in Kursk region, the Russian army lost up to a battalion of North Korean infantry soldiers and Russian paratroops,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address on Jan. 4, citing information from Ukraine&apos;s top commander. He added that &quot;this is significant.&quot; While Zelensky did not share further details, a battalion typically consists of several hundred troops. In late 2024, Zelensky also called on China to use its influence over North Korea to prevent the deployment of North Korean soldiers to the front line. &quot;The Korean people should not lose their people in battles in Europe. And this can be influenced, in particular, by Korea&apos;s neighbors, in particular, China. If China is sincere in its statements that the war should not expand, appropriate influence on Pyongyang is necessary,&quot; Zelensky said. Russia has stationed approximately 12,000 North Korean soldiers in the Kursk region to assist in ousting Ukrainian forces. The first confirmed battles between Ukrainian and North Korean units occurred on Nov. 5. Ukraine first began its surprise incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6. Ukrainian forces have been fighting to hold onto territory in the region ever since in hopes it can be used as a bargaining chip in future negotiations with Russia. In the first days of 2025, Russia carried out a series of attacks against Ukraine, causing the destruction of many residential buildings and infrastructure, as well as civilian casualties. According to Zelensky, Russian troops launched more than 630 attack drones, around 740 guided aerial bombs, and nearly 50 missiles of various types this week, targeting settlements across Ukraine. Overnight alone, 103 Shahed-type drones launched against Ukraine contained 8,755 foreign-made components, the president said. Ukraine shot down 61 drones, the Air Force said. Another 42 drones were &quot;lost.&quot; &quot;The sanctions pressure on supply chains for foreign components remains insufficient,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Russia continues to acquire the components and manufacturing tools it needs &#x2014; almost globally &#x2014; and uses them in the weapons it employs to terrorize Ukraine.&quot; The president urged partners to bolster Ukraine&apos;s air-defense and long-range capabilities, as well as strengthen sanctions against Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-52/	2025-01-05T10:56:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166685846.jpg
Uzbek court sentences man for participating in war against Ukraine on Russian side	A court in Uzbekistan sentenced a 39-year-old man to four years and two months of restricted freedom for participating in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, gazeta.uz reported on Jan. 5. The man traveled to Moscow in April 2023 seeking seasonal work and later joined the Russian Armed Forces, after undergoing military training for two months at a military base in Moscow. He then fought in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts until December 2023, and admitted to killing ten Ukrainian soldiers. According to his claims, he was promised a monthly combat salary of 450,000 rubles but only received two payments of 150,000 rubles before the payments stopped. The defendant admitted to financial hardship as the motivation for joining and voluntarily surrendered upon returning to Uzbekistan. The court took into account his admission of guilt, remorse, and clean criminal record when determining the sentence. In Uzbekistan, mercenary activities are punishable by up to 10 years, and another similar case recently resulted in a five-year prison sentence. At the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Uzbekistan declared that it did not recognize the proxy authorities in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and supported Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity. However, Tashkent continues to actively trade with Moscow, and the Uzbek government maintains close ties with the Russian leadership.	https://kyivindependent.com/uzbek-court-sentences-man-for-participating-in-the-russian-army-against-ukraine/	2025-01-05T09:11:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1257504169.jpg
Syrskyi orders to reinforce French-trained brigade with drones after reports of mismanagement	Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi ordered to boost Ukraine&apos;s 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Mechanized Brigade with drones after reports of desertion and mismanagement, he said on Jan. 5. &quot;I paid special attention to building up the capabilities of the unmanned systems unit of the 155th Mechanized Brigade, as well as to the problematic issues that need to be resolved,&quot; Syrskyi said. His remarks came following a media investigation that claimed that soldiers of the unit, now deployed near Pokrovsk, have suffered losses and went AWOL (absent without leave) in large numbers due to poor command and organization on Ukraine&apos;s side. Ukraine&apos;s State Bureau of Investigation has launched an investigation. Sysrkyi&apos;s statement marks the first time that the military leadership mentioned the 155th Brigade, although without elaborating on the details of the scandal. Yurii Butusov, the chief editor of the Censor.net, claimed on Jan. 4, citing the outlet&apos;s unnamed sources, that President Volodymyr Zelensky held a meeting with the military and top officials and &quot;took the investigation under his control.&quot; The brigade is a flagship project under which NATO countries will help train new Ukrainian military formations and provide heavy equipment. The training of the 155th Brigade, named after an 11th-century Kyiv Rus princess and spouse of French King Henry I, was announced by French President Emmanuel Macron in June. The unit has about 5,800 troops, fewer than 2,000 of whom have undergone training in France. According to Butusov, the unit&apos;s founding was an &quot;organizational chaos&quot; since the very beginning. Of the 1,924 soldiers eventually sent to France, only 51 had more than a year of military service, while 1,414 had served for less than two months, Butusov wrote. The unit was also plagued by large numbers of soldiers going AWOL &#x2014; about 50 deserted in France, in addition to hundreds who left their posts even before the unit was deployed at the front, according to the journalist. Between March and November, over 1,700 soldiers had gone AWOL, Butusov claimed without providing evidence. Though the unit was replenished with new recruits, these often did not undergo &quot;proper selection process,&quot; the journalist added. The 155th Brigade reportedly also did not receive drones or electronic warfare equipment from the Ukrainian command. This, in addition to poor organization and insufficient training, is said to have contributed to the losses the unit suffered once deployed in November. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.	https://kyivindependent.com/syrskyi-orders-to-reinforce-french-trained-brigade-with-drones-after-reports-of-mismanagement/	2025-01-05T07:59:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1245863177.jpg
Scholz denies claims that he could meet with Putin in Russia	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz rejected on Jan. 5 claims that he could meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin before the end of February, RND reported. Roderich Kiesewetter, defense spokesperson for Germany&apos;s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said on X that &quot;there are increasing indications that Chancellor Scholz will travel to Moscow and meet Putin before Feb. 23.&quot; &quot;That is a false claim. That is deeply indecent,&quot; Scholz said. Secretary General of Germany&apos;s governing Social Democratic Party (SPD) Matthias Miersch described Kiesewetter&apos;s post as &quot;extremely problematic, infamous and dishonest.&quot; He also said that this is a violation of the agreement &quot;on fair competition&quot; amid the upcoming elections. German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said the &quot;legal steps&quot; over the CDU&apos;s spokesperson claims are being prepared. The CDU is currently leading in pre-election polls, with party leader Friedrich Merz widely seen as the frontrunner to become Germany&apos;s next chancellor. Scholz and Putin held their first phone conversation in nearly two years on Nov. 15, according to a German government statement. The hour-long call saw Scholz condemning Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, urging Putin to withdraw troops from Ukraine and pursue a &quot;just and lasting peace&quot; through negotiations. Scholz reaffirmed Germany&apos;s &quot;unwavering determination to support Ukraine in its defensive struggle against Russian aggression for as long as necessary.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 15 that Scholz&apos;s call with Putin opens a &quot;Pandora&apos;s box,&quot; potentially leading to &quot;other conversations and other calls.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/scholz-denies-claims-that-he-could-meet-with-putin-in-russia/	2025-01-05T06:13:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190395993.jpg
More than 50,000 foreign parts found in Russian drones, missiles launched at Ukraine this week, Zelensky says	Hundreds of drones, missiles and guided aerial bombs used by Russia to attack Ukraine this week contained overall more than 50,000 foreign components, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 5. In the first days of 2025, Russia carried out a series of attacks against Ukraine, causing the destruction of many residential buildings and infrastructure, as well as civilian casualties. According to Zelensky, Russian troops launched more than 630 attack drones, around 740 guided aerial bombs, and nearly 50 missiles of various types this week, targeting settlements across Ukraine.

Over 54,000 Russian targets were hit with Ukrainian drones in December, Syrskyi says	Ukrainian soldiers attacked more than 54,000 Russian targets with drones in December, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Jan. 5. A total of 49% of the targets were struck by kamikaze drones, according to Syrskyi. Throughout Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing the way wars are fought. Russia increased the number of drones with fiber-optic control channels, which pose a threat to military equipment during their movement, Syrksyi said. According to the general, Ukrainian soldiers also started using fiber-optic FPV drones, &quot;which expands the capabilities to defeat and destroy Russian military equipment and personnel.&quot; The command also briefed Syrskyi on high-tech developments in the field of unmanned systems and electronic warfare and their use on the battlefield, as well as countering the latest models of Russian equipment. &quot;We are increasing the number of brigades with a reinforced unmanned component,&quot; the general said. &quot;We are finalizing the concept of using a separate unmanned systems brigade and its typical structure.&quot; Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks by Ukrainian troops. Kyiv has delivered more than 200,000 domestically-produced drones to front-line units so far in December, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-54-000-russian-targets-attacked-with-ukraines-drones-in-december-syrskyi-says/	2025-01-05T04:20:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1604726426.jpg
Ukraine launches new offensive in Russia's Kursk Oblast, mixed reports surface on outcome	Ukrainian troops attacked Russian forces in several directions in Kursk Oblast, Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s counter-disinformation center, claimed on Jan. 5. Reports by Russian pro-war Telegram channels have echoed the statement, saying that a new Kyiv offensive is underway. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, Russian troops repelled two offensives conducted by Ukrainian assault groups in Kursk Oblast on Jan. 5. The Kyiv Independent couldn&apos;t independently verify these claims at the time of publication. The reports come as Moscow has been ramping up its efforts to push Ukraine out of the embattled Kursk Oblast as Kyiv continues to hold on to a small piece of Russian territory in the hopes of gaining leverage in possible future negotiations. Roman Alyokhin, a Russian pro-war blogger and a former advisor to Kursk Oblast&apos;s governor, claimed that Kyiv launched an attack northeast of Sudzha toward the village of Bolshoye Soldatskoye, using armored vehicles and demining equipment. According to him, the Ukrainian army also &quot;intensified its actions&quot; in other areas of Kursk Oblast. Kovalenko said that Ukrainian troops attacked Russian forces in several directions in Kursk Oblast, which &quot;came as a surprise to them.&quot; &quot;Kursk Oblast, good news! Russia is getting what it deserves,&quot; Andrii Yermak, head of the President&apos;s Office, wrote on Telegram. The Ukrainian military has not publicly reported any new operations in Kursk Oblast. Acting Kursk Oblast Governor Alexander Khinshtein said on Jan. 5 that Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yunus-bek Yevkurov had arrived in Kursk. It was not immediately clear whether this visit was related to the ongoing activity in the region. Ukrainian forces launched an offensive in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in early August, achieving initial tactical success. In recent months, Ukraine has been on the back foot as Russia reportedly recaptured half of the lost territory and deployed reinforcements, including North Korean troops. The White House said on Dec. 27 that North Korean soldiers suffered over 1,000 casualties in Kursk Oblast over the past week alone as they carried out &quot;human wave&quot; assaults with little effect.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-2/	2025-01-05T03:33:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2166170923-1.jpg

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Storm Ossetia is a Russian assault unit within the 429th Motorized Rifle Regiment of the Russian Armed Forces. It was formed in Russia&apos;s Republic of North Ossetia-Alania in 2022 to take part in Moscow&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-storm-ossetia-battalion-chief-of-staff-killed-in-ukrainian-drone-attack-military-intelligence-claims/	2025-01-05T02:10:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/--------------2025-01-05-114851.png

Ukrainian educator and philologist Oleksii Halionka killed in Chernihiv missile strike	Oleksii Halionka, a 72-year-old Ukrainian educator and philologist, was killed on 3 January 2025 when a Russian missile hit his home in Chernihiv. The attack, involving three ballistic missiles, struck residential areas, killing Halionka, injuring four others, and damaging several homes. Halionka had already suffered significant losses in 2022 when Russian forces destroyed his family home, along with a personal library of 4,000 books and other belongings. Since then, he had been living in a small building on the same property. &#x201C;He had big plans for life this year, including building a new house,&#x201D; his niece Liudmyla Halionka said in an interview with local media outlet Cheline. &#x201C;He was a very kind and sensitive person.

Local authorities confirmed the missiles targeted civilian infrastructure, leaving parts of the neighborhood heavily damaged. Chernihiv Oblast, situated on Ukraine&apos;s northern border with Russia, was partially occupied during the early stages of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Although Russian forces withdrew from the region in April 2022, Chernihiv remains under near-daily attack due to its proximity to the border.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-educator-and-philologist-oleksii-halionka-killed-in-chernihiv-missile-strike/	2025-01-04T20:57:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/halionka.png
Georgian businesses and employees to carry out nationwide strike demanding new elections	Georgian citizens are being urged to participate in a nationwide strike on Jan. 15 to demand the release of detained protestors and to call for new elections, Protest 24 posted on Facebook. The strike, organized by Protest 24, will begin at 3 p.m. and last for three hours, with businesses and employees halting work during this time. Organizers aim to highlight the potential consequences of political isolation, such as economic stagnation, unemployment, and poverty. The dissatisfaction of citizens, stemming from disputed parliamentary elections in October, has intensified with the controversial inauguration of Mikheil Kavelashvili and the government&#x2019;s stance against European integration. The ruling Georgian Dream party, founded by oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, has led Georgia closer to the Kremlin while hindering its accession to the European Union. The controversial foreign agents law adopted earlier this year led the EU to effectively freeze Georgia&apos;s accession process. Protesters hope the strike will underscore public frustration and push for democratic reforms.	https://kyivindependent.com/nationwide-strike-in-demand-of-new-elections-announced-in-georgia/	2025-01-04T18:08:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2181587481.jpg

German opposition suggests Scholz could meet Putin before end of February	Roderich Kiesewetter, defense spokesperson for Germany&apos;s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said saidthat Chancellor Olaf Scholz could meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin before Germany&apos;s parliamentary elections on Feb. 23. &quot;There are increasing indications that Chancellor Scholz will travel to Moscow and meet Putin before February 23,&quot; Kiesewetter said on X. &quot;For Ukraine, implementing the intended plans would mean, among other things, a suspension of the Paris Charter for 10 to 20 years. How the Ukrainian population or our neighbors react to all of this will be revealing.&quot; Kiesewetter criticized the potential meeting, warning that &quot;Ukraine must not be the object or the victim. Russia is up to its neck in economic and social terms, but Ukraine, which is in much worse shape, should be accommodated&#x2014;not Russia!&quot; He also cautioned that any negotiations at this time &quot;are at the expense of Ukraine and de facto mean submission.&quot; In his election campaign, Scholz has positioned himself as a &quot;chancellor of peace,&quot; advocating for both support for Ukraine and negotiations with Russia to end the war. However, Kiesewetter took aim at what he referred to as the &quot;so-called &apos;Moscow connection&apos;&quot; and called for greater clarity and resolve within Germany&apos;s leadership. The CDU is currently leading in pre-election polls, with party leader Friedrich Merz widely seen as the frontrunner to become Germany&apos;s next chancellor.

Heavy Russian, North Korean losses in Russia's Kursk region, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky reported significant losses among Russian and North Korean forces during recent clashes in Russia&apos;s southern Kursk region. &quot;In battles yesterday and today near a single village, Makhnovka, in Kursk region, the Russian army lost up to a battalion of North Korean infantry soldiers and Russian paratroops,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address on Jan. 4, citing information from Ukraine&apos;s top commander. He added that &quot;this is significant.&quot; While Zelensky did not share further details, a battalion typically consists of several hundred troops. In late 2024, Zelensky also called on China to use its influence over North Korea to prevent the deployment of North Korean soldiers to the front line. &quot;The Korean people should not lose their people in battles in Europe. And this can be influenced, in particular, by Korea&apos;s neighbors, in particular, China. If China is sincere in its statements that the war should not expand, appropriate influence on Pyongyang is necessary,&quot; Zelensky said. Russia has stationed approximately 12,000 North Korean soldiers in the Kursk region to assist in ousting Ukrainian forces. The first confirmed battles between Ukrainian and North Korean units occurred on Nov. 5. Ukraine first began its surprise incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6. Ukrainian forces have been fighting to hold onto territory in the region ever since in hopes it can be used as a bargaining chip in future negotiations with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/heavy-russian-north-korean-losses-in-russias-kursk-region-zelensky-says/	2025-01-04T11:33:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1125139920.jpg
Over 20 foreign citizens to be deported from Georgia for participating in protests	The Georgian government is planning to deport 25 foreigners for participating in mass protests in November and December 2024, News Georgia reported on Jan. 4, citing a Georgian Interior Ministry statement. The pro-Russian Georgian Dream party claimed a sweeping victory in the Oct. 26 elections amid widespread allegations of fraud and intimidation. The disputed results triggered mass demonstrations in Tbilisi. The Migration Department of the Georgian Interior Ministry has initiated expulsion proceedings against 25 foreign nationals who participated in the protests in Tbilisi in November and December. The court also imposed various administrative penalties on them. The ministry added that 10 out of 25 citizens have already left Georgia&apos;s territory, without specifying which countries they are citizens of. There are no official statistics on foreigners detained during the protests. Over 20 of the nearly 450 arrested were foreign nationals, most of them Russians, News Georgia reported, citing reports by NGOs and other media. In December, foreigners who attended the protests began to be summoned en masse to the Migration Department. Human rights activists noted that this practice did not comply with international standards and warned that the deportation of foreign nationals for participating in peaceful demonstrations was contrary to national law. Some 91 foreigners were ordered to leave the country between November and December 2024. According to News Georgia, more than a quarter of them participated in anti-government protests. The ruling party, founded by oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, has led Georgia closer to the Kremlin while hindering its accession to the European Union. The controversial foreign agents law adopted earlier this year led the EU to effectively freeze Georgia&apos;s accession process. The parliamentary elections and ensuing political crisis sparked a wave of large-scale demonstrations in Tbilisi. A second round of protests kicked off when Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced that Georgia&apos;s integration into the EU could be postponed until 2028.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-20-foreign-citizens-to-be-deported-from-georgia-for-participating-in-mass-protests/	2025-01-04T07:52:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2186867239.jpg

Transnistria urges residents to heat stoves with wood amid significant gas shortages	Vadim Krasnoselsky, the head of the Russia-led breakaway Transnistria region in Moldova, urged residents on Jan. 3 to heat their stoves with wood whenever possible amid gas shortages. Russia&apos;s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom halted gas deliveries to Moldova on Jan. 1, citing alleged unpaid debts by Moldovagaz. The suspension triggered an energy crisis in Transnistria, which now faces industrial collapse due to widespread power outages. Authorities in Transnistria also rejected earlier Chisinau&apos;s offer to help the region purchase gas via European platforms. Some 1,500 high-rise buildings in Transnistria are currently without heating and hot water, and nearly 72,000 homes are without gas, according to Krasnoselsky. Krasnoselsky added that 150 gas boiler houses have been disconnected, while two large social facilities have been switched to diesel heating. &quot;The almost complete gasification of the (region) is one of the reasons for well-deserved pride: we strived for 100% coverage of the population with this benefit of civilization. But today, we remember with gratitude those who built housing with stove heating,&quot; he said. &quot;Fortunately, our region is rich in wood. We still have stocks. Solid fuel sales points have been opened in every district. At the request of citizens who cannot provide themselves with firewood due to life circumstances, it is delivered free of charge,&quot; Krasnoselsky said, adding that &quot;there are no hopeless situations.&quot; Russian troops have been stationed in Transnistria since the early 1990s. While the rest of Moldova has switched to European energy supplies, the region is heavily dependent on Russian gas. Although a deal allowing Russian gas to transit through Ukraine expired on the same day that Russia halted gas supplies to Moldova, Gazprom insists the suspension is due to Moldova&apos;s outstanding debt, not transit issues. Moldovan officials dispute Gazprom&apos;s claims regarding outstanding payments, noting an international audit failed to verify the debts.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-installed-government-of-transnistria-urges-residents-to-heat-stoves-with-wood-amid-significant-gas-shortages/	2025-01-04T06:43:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1686318530.jpg
Internally displaced Ukrainians’ struggle to survive takes some back to Russian occupation	Last winter as Olena Morozova braced for a long and arduous trip to Ukrainian-controlled territory from her Russian-occupied home in Lysychansk in Luhansk Oblast, her friends were traveling in the opposite direction. The friends &#x2014; a family with two sons &#x2014; came back to their house in Lysychansk because they couldn&#x2019;t afford to pay the rent in Dnipro, the regional capital in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which hosts the largest number of internally displaced people in Ukraine, Morozova told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;They told me it was very difficult (to live) in Ukrainian-controlled territory, too,&#x201D; Morozova said, &#x201C;But I didn&#x2019;t even want to listen, because we were set to leave (Lysychansk) after the New Year.&#x201D; After nearly three years of all-out war, some internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Ukraine are opting to return to Russian-occupied areas due to the Ukrainian government&#x2019;s failure to provide them with proper housing and enough financial aid to adequately resettle. An estimated one-third of the Ukrainian population, or nearly 14 million people, left their homes in 2022 following the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Many have returned since, but at least 3.5 million remain internally displaced at the moment, according to the UN. Official data on how many people have returned to Russian occupation is difficult to obtain. The Social Policy Ministry recorded 1,262 displaced persons returning to occupied territories over the last nine months, the Ombudsman Office told the Kyiv Independent but noted the number could be higher, citing limited access to the data. Some estimate the number is much higher. Luhansk-born Ukrainian lawmaker Maksym Tkachenko from the ruling Servant of the People party recently said that 150,000 people had left Ukrainian-controlled territories to return to Russian occupation.

(Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)After his comment was widely published in the media and a top Ukrainian official accused him of lying &#x201C;for the hype,&#x201D; Tkachenko retracted his statement, adding that it was his &#x201C;unfounded and emotional assumption.&#x201D; Nonetheless, other officials commented on the failed state policy for the displaced, without citing their numbers. At the outset of the war, Ukraine&#x2019;s government responded to the influx of displaced persons by announcing financial assistance, compensation for employers who gave work to IDPs, and partial or full subsidies on the cost of living, according to the Ombudsman&#x2019;s Office. It has also ordered local administrations to provide them with free housing, which has proved difficult to get and often inadequate to people&#x2019;s needs. Stories of some families show that a lack of enough government assistance may be forcing some to make the decision to return home, even if it means life under Russian occupation, where basic services are lacking and people live under the threat of prosecution for their Ukrainian identity. &#x201C;Now (my friends) are crying and want to return (to Ukraine),&#x201D; said Morozova, 48, whose family is happy with their choice to move to Kyiv despite their struggle to make ends meet without any state support. Many IDPs live on the brink of poverty, with 40% relying on humanitarian assistance from the state and international humanitarian organizations to meet their basic needs, according to a UN November 2024 survey. Their struggles only got worse in March 2024 after the government revised its regulations on financial aid towards living expenses for the internally displaced &#x2014; set around $45 per month for adults and $70 for children and people with disabilities. The allowance is far less than the actual subsistence minimum, last estimated by the Social Policy Ministry in 2022 at around $145 and projected to be much higher now. Per the new decree, the number of people receiving the payments dropped more than twice &#x2013; from 2.5 million in 2023 to over 1 million in August 2024, according to the Social Policy Ministry. The payments will be revised every six months, cutting off more people as the government aims to primarily help those with the lowest income.

(Stanislav Ivanov/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)But for many displaced people, this aid is &#x201C;not just partial assistance in paying for housing, but in fact one of the few means of subsistence,&#x201D; the Ombudsman&#x2019;s Office told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;We rented whatever was available,&#x201D; said Antonina Palamarchuk, 64, who fled Myrnohrad, Donetsk Oblast, and moved around Ukraine until settling in Kyiv with her daughter. The cost of their apartment &#x2014; Hr 12,000 or $280 &#x2014; exceeds Antonina&#x2019;s pension, which is just $2 more than the legislated minimum that would have allowed her to receive financial aid from the state. She told the Kyiv Independent that a relative decided to go live with family in Donetsk, occupied by Russia since 2014, because she had nowhere to live in Ukraine-controlled territory. Even as the government has claimed to provide free housing for the displaced, many wait months to be housed. Activists say that the reason behind the long wait times is not the lack of available lodgings, but their inadequate management at the local and national level. &#x201C;There is certainly little help from the state in the form of housing,&#x201D; said lawmaker Tkachenko, who also co-founded a nonprofit &#x201C;VPO Ukrainy&#x201D; that helps displaced people. As of July 1, only 2,995 internally displaced people in the country were living in the temporary municipal lodgings, and 13,048 were on the waiting list, the Infrastructure Development Ministry told the Kyiv Independent. Tkachenko said that conditions in government-provided housing are often inadequate &#x2014; such as &#x201C;one shower used by 50 women and children&#x201D; &#x2014; while people are often forced to pay for utility services themselves.

(Yuriy Dyachyshyn/AFP via Getty Images)Though the state offers to cover these expenses for the local administrations, it&#x2019;s &#x201C;easier for some managers of these facilities to collect money directly from displaced people&#x201D; rather than wait to be reimbursed by the state, a process that can be long and bureaucratic, Tkachenko told the Kyiv Independent. His account corresponds with a recent UN survey from October 2024, which said that 23% of IDPs reported lacking adequate accommodation, compared to only 6% of the non-displaced. &#x201C;We&apos;re talking about the minimum necessities of life,&#x201D; Tkachenko said. A 2022 decree mandated that local governments finance and build shelters or provide municipal buildings for the displaced. While local communities helped lots of internally displaced people in 2022, they have since run into trouble finding the resources to accommodate everyone as the war stretches into its third year, said Petro Andriushchenko, ex-advisor to the mayor of Russian-occupied Mariupol. Meanwhile, habitable state-owned facilities sit empty. According to Andriushchenko, the Education Ministry never placed any IDPs in university dorms, even though they have remained vacant as students study remotely due to the war. &#x201C;(Local) communities ask a logical question: Why should we give away our building (to the displaced) if there is an empty state building?&#x201D; he said. He added that international organizations are ready to finance reconstructions of the living quarters for the displaced, so the government&#x2019;s passive approach had little to do with the lack of funds. &#x201C;People on the top just don&#x2019;t want to make uncomfortable managerial decisions,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s about their inability to put things in order in state-owned real estate that is empty or repurpose it.&#x201D; Karyna, 10, who was evacuated from the Kherson region, sits on a bed in a room where she lives with her parents and sister at a refugee reception center in Mykolaiv, Ukraine, on Oct. 28, 2023, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. (Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)Another reason for what Andriushchenko described as the government&#x2019;s &#x201C;non-existent policy&#x201D; towards the displaced citizens could be Ukraine&#x2019;s strong civil society. Since the onset of the full-scale war, countless volunteers, individuals, and organizations have mobilized to help their fellow citizens. &#x201C;Volunteers picked us up (after we crossed the border),&#x201D; Morozova said, describing her family&#x2019;s trip from Russia&apos;s border to the nearest city Sumy in the north of Ukraine last winter. Volunteers also helped them find the first place to stay in a village near Kyiv, and later &#x2014; a single-room apartment that Morozova now rents with her husband and son. &#x201C;The flat is really broken, but at least the roof doesn&#x2019;t leak and there are no drafts,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;We lived in the cold for two years (in occupation).&#x201D; Amid higher unemployment, diminishing government support, and harsh living conditions as Russia bombards Ukrainian energy infrastructure, some people turn to their last resort: going back home to Russian occupation. The trip back itself can be treacherous. There are no border crossings between Ukrainian-controlled and Russia-held territories in Ukraine and the only remaining border crossing at the two countries&#x2019; borders is for entrance back into Ukraine only, said Deputy Presidential Office head Iryna Vereshchuk during a TV interview on Nov. 27. Vereshchuk blamed the lack of border crossings as the reason why the government is unable to keep official statistics on the number of displaced persons returning to occupation. The only option for Ukrainians to get into Russia is by plane from other countries to Moscow&#x2019;s Sheremetyevo airport, where Russia has set up a &#x201C;filtration&#x201D; facility where they are screened by special services on arrival. This route is long and expensive, with ticket costs starting around $1,000, according to Vereshchuk. &#x201C;Filtration&#x201D; can reportedly last for days, as members of the Russian Security Service question people&#x2019;s allegiance and check their phones. Russian authorities said in October that 83,000 Ukrainians entered the country through Sheremetyevo over the past year, while another 24,000 were turned away.

(Libkos/Getty Images)Based on Andriushchenko&#x2019;s communications with people who tried going through the airport and the data he claims to get from sources in occupied Mariupol, he and other activists estimate the number of Ukrainians turned away on arrival to be much higher &#x2014; roughly 200,000 or more. The number of those who went in could be as high as 150,000. &#x201C;They just go wherever they have a place to live,&#x201D; Andriushchenko said. &#x201C;Because here they simply have nothing to spend or nothing to pay for food.&#x201D; Others return home to look after ailing relatives. According to Olha, a 67-year-old Zaporizhzhia native currently living in Kyiv whose name has been changed for security reasons, one of her friends returned to occupation in September to look after her bed-ridden husband, despite being detained and held captive by Russians early into the full-scale invasion. Olha hasn&apos;t heard from her friend since. While Russian propaganda uses the numbers of returning Ukrainians to claim that life under occupation is better than in Ukrainian-controlled territories, international media reports and stories told by Ukrainians in Russian-controlled areas paint a different picture. In Lysychansk, Morozova told the Kyiv Independent she didn&#x2019;t see fresh bread for half a year after its occupation in July 2022. She survived by selling fire-cooked dumplings, while her husband made little money by delivering drinking water to the elderly neighbors who had some retirement savings. After weathering two years without utilities except for gas, Morozova fell severely sick and couldn&#x2019;t get out of bed. There was no medical assistance available in the city. The Russian soldiers which her family asked for help said that they &#x201D;have nothing to do with civilians.&#x201D; A neighbor took her to the hospital in Luhansk, occupied since 2014, where she received some medical help. &#x201C;They injected me with Ukrainian drugs. Expired, though,&#x201D; Morozova added. When she spoke in October with her friends who returned to occupied Lysychansk last winter, they told her that little had changed: There was no water supply or central heating and electricity was unstable.

There are a lot of mice in apartments because there are a lot of empty apartments &#x2014; many people have moved out.&#x201D; Their story reflects some of the dire conditions Ukrainians face under Russia&#x2019;s rule. In addition to prosecution, detention, and murders of pro-Ukrainian activists, they also include enforced Russification. Basic services like schools for children are available only for those with Russian passports. People without Russian IDs can&#x2019;t prove their property rights under a 2023 decree. Starting from July 1, 2024, they can be evicted from their own homes as &#x201C;aliens.&#x201D; According to Andriushchenko, the decree incited a wave of returnees to occupied territories in the past months, as people came home just to make sure their property wasn&apos;t taken away, going back to Ukraine again afterward. But activists say that displaced Ukrainians can&#x2019;t even receive state compensation for damaged property if their homes are in occupation, as financial aid is only given to homeowners in Ukraine-controlled areas. &#x201C;The government treats the displaced like invisible people,&#x201D; said Andriushchenko, who left his post as a mayor&#x2019;s adviser recently.

Russian soldiers near Toretsk disguise as civilians to bypass Ukrainian positions, military says	Russian troops are disguising themselves as civilians to bypass Ukrainian military positions in the Toretsk sector of the front line in Donetsk Oblast, commander of the mortar battery of the presidential brigade, call sign &quot;Mozok&quot; (&quot;Brain&quot;), told Suspilne on Jan. 3. The commander&apos;s statement comes after reports on Russian forces starting to move toward the town of Toretsk. Fighting with armored combat vehicles, motorcycles, and buggies took place in the village of Nelipivka, located south of Toretsk, in late December. The soldier, whose name is undisclosed for security reasons, said that after passing Ukrainian positions, Russian soldiers disguised as civilians either wait for reinforcements or use anti-tank mines to attack Ukrainian positions. &quot;Some of the soldiers are former prisoners. They are tasked with smuggling anti-tank mines and throwing them into the area of our firing positions when the fighters cannot be knocked out during regular battles. They are trying to blow up buildings where our guys are located,&quot; the soldier told Suspilne. Small infantry groups are also trying to storm and bypass positions under the cover of fog, he added. Toretsk has become one of the hottest spots in Donetsk Oblast in recent months as Russian troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in its defense of the front line. Apart from Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine expects Russian forces to launch larger-scale attacks in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-soldiers-in-toretsk-area-disguise-themselves-as-civilians-bypass-ukrainian-positions-ukraines-military-says/	2025-01-04T06:18:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2167352745.jpg
Drones reportedly target one of Russia's largest sea trade ports in Leningrad Oblast	Drones attacked Russia&apos;s largest commercial seaport, Ust-Luga, in Leningrad Oblast overnight on Jan. 4, the independent news channel Astra reported. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine has been regularly targeting facilities in Russia that fuel its war efforts. Most of the drones that attacked Leningrad Oblast, located over 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) from the Ukrainian border, were shot down over the terminal of Novotrans, a Russian transportation and logistics company, Astra reported, citing its undisclosed sources. Governor Aleksandr Drozdenko reported that four drones were downed in Leningrad Oblast using electronic warfare and firearms. The attack damaged windows in one of the buildings on the port&apos;s territory, according to preliminary information. There were no casualties, Drozdenko said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The Jan. 4 attack on the Russian port in Leningrad Oblast is not the first attack of its kind. On Jan. 24, 2024, Novatek&apos;s gas-condensate plant caught fire at the port of Ust-Luga following a possible coordinated effort by Ukraine to strike key targets deep inside Russian territory. The Ust-Luga Commercial Seaport began operations in December 2001 with the opening of a coal terminal. In the early 2020s, it became one of the largest seaports in Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-reportedly-target-one-of-russias-largest-sea-trade-ports-in-leningrad-oblast/	2025-01-04T04:24:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1230851711.jpeg
Russia launches over 300 drones, 20 missiles at Ukraine in first 3 days of new year, Zelensky says	Russia launched more than 300 drones and 20 missiles, including ballistic missiles, at Ukrainian cities and villages over the first three days of the new year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 3. In the first days of 2025, Russia carried out a series of attacks against Ukraine, causing the destruction of many residential buildings and infrastructure, as well as civilian casualties. Zelensky added that the Russian army also strikes settlements close to the front line with guided aerial bombs every day. &quot;Such Russian terror, which is not decreasing its intensity, requires us and all our partners to continue to build our air shield and all its systemic elements, from patriots to mobile fire groups,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;It is necessary to replenish the stock of anti-missiles for air defense constantly. We need to increase the capacity of mobile fire groups constantly. I am grateful to all the partners who help us.&quot; The president also announced meetings and talks next week to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s air defense. The next Ramstein-format summit of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) will take place on Jan. 9. The meeting will be the first since the leader-level summit in Germany was postponed in October 2024 after U.S. President Joe Biden canceled his foreign trips to handle Hurricane Milton.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-over-300-drones-20-missiles-at-ukraine-in-first-3-days-of-new-year-zelensky-says/	2025-01-04T02:54:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/drone-strike.jpeg
Slovak state energy company to continue supplying electricity to Ukraine despite Fico's threats	Slovakia&apos;s state-controlled transmission system operator SEPS said it will continue supplying electricity to Ukraine as part of an emergency assistance contract, despite threats from Slovak Prime Minister Roberto Fico, the iRozhlas media outlet reported on Jan. 3. Fico said on Dec. 27 that his government would consider halting electricity supplies to Ukraine after a deal to transit Russian gas to Europe through Ukraine expired on Dec. 31. Kyiv had repeatedly warned it would not renew the transit agreement to avoid financing Russia&#x2019;s war. Due to Russia&apos;s ongoing attacks on the energy system, Ukraine has turned to neighboring countries, including Slovakia, to supply additional electricity from abroad. SEPS will continue to cooperate with the state-owned energy company Ukrenergo under a valid contract extended last spring for another 12 months, the media outlet reported. According to the contract, the Slovak company can supply Ukraine with up to 150 megawatts of electricity for emergency assistance. SEPS has committed to ensuring the cross-border electricity transmission on &quot;standard terms.&quot; SEPS also provides cross-border electricity transmission via high-voltage lines. In the first 11 months of last year, net electricity exports from Slovakia to Ukraine reached 2.43 terawatt-hours, which is three and a half times higher than in the same period in 2023, according to iRozhlas. Slovakia&apos;s former Economy Minister Karel Hirman said previously that electricity is sold to Ukraine by traders, not the state, iRozhlas reported. Hirman added that Slovakia would be drawn into a conflict within the European Union if the electricity supply to Ukraine was stopped. Apart from threats to cut off electricity supplies to Ukraine, Fico also said Slovakia could reduce aid for Ukrainian refugees in response to Ukraine&apos;s decision to terminate Russian gas transit. Before Fico&apos;s return to power, Slovakia had been a staunch supporter of Ukraine. It was the first country to send Kyiv fighter jets after the full-scale invasion and a reliable supplier of military aid. Fico&apos;s government initiated a stark policy reversal, halting weapons deliveries to Ukraine and adopting rhetoric blaming the West for Russia&apos;s war. Fico also has close ties to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, another Central European populist leader with a friendly attitude toward Russian President Vladimir Putin.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovak-state-energy-company-to-continue-to-supply-electricity-to-ukraine-despite-ficos-threats/	2025-01-04T02:49:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1957977106.jpg
Woman injured in Russian Jan. 3 attack on Kyiv Oblast dies in hospital	A woman injured by falling drone debris during a Russian attack on Kyiv Oblast on Jan. 3 died in the hospital, the Kyiv Military Administration reported on Jan. 4. Russia launched a large-scale drone attack on Kyiv Oblast early in the morning on Jan. 3. The attack killed one person and injured four others, including a 16-year-old teenager. The woman, who died in the hospital the day after the strike, had a severe abdominal wound. &quot;Doctors fought for her life for almost a day until the last minute,&quot; the statement read. According to the local military administration, another victim of the Russian Jan. 3 attack is in intensive care with a back injury. A young man with a knee injury is also under medical supervision but is not in critical condition. Russia also launched a drone attack on Kyiv on the morning of Jan. 1, killing two people and injuring six others, including two pregnant women. The attack damaged a building of the National Bank of Ukraine.

Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 2, injure 21 over past day	Russian strikes against Ukraine killed two civilians and injured 21 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 4. Russian forces launched 81 drones at Ukraine overnight from the Russian cities of Bryansk, Kursk, Orel, and Primosk-Akhtarsk, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare units, mobile firing groups, and aviation shot down 34 drones in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Odesa, and Mykolaiv oblasts. Forty-seven drones were lost allegedly due to electronic warfare countermeasures. Russian forces launched three Iskander-M ballistic missiles at Chernihiv Oblast on Jan. 3, killing a 72-year-old man and injuring four people, Governor Viacheslav Chaus reported. The attack destroyed two houses and damaged the other 10. Russia struck the village of Stepnohirsk in Zaporizhzhia Oblast on Jan. 3 with Grad multiple rocket launchers, killing a man, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. The man&apos;s wife was hospitalized with injuries. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 40 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, over the past day. As a result of the attacks, eight people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Russian forces also launched a drone attack at the village of Antonivka in Kherson Oblast on the morning of Jan. 4, injuring a 71-year-old man. He was hospitalized with mine-blast trauma and shrapnel wounds to the head and abdomen, according to the local military administration.

Lukashenko to visit China ahead of Belarus presidential elections	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko will visit China this month ahead of the Jan. 26 presidential elections, Ukraine&apos;s Center for Countering Disinformation reported on Jan. 3. With Belarus isolated from the West due to Lukashenko&apos;s repressive regime and continued support for Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, Lukashenko has found China to be a key ally. In August the two nations pledged to strengthen security ties and improve cooperation. Lukashenko is looking to improve mutual cooperation between Belarus and China in various fields, including pharmaceuticals, mechanical engineering, and the defense industry, the Center for Countering Disinformation reported. Lukashenko is likely looking to reduce Belarusian dependence on Russia and strengthen his hand in his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Center said. Belarus is under pressure from Russia due to economic and energy dependency, debt from Russian loans, and Moscow&apos;s military presence in Belarus. Lukashenko is also likely angling for China to mediate a reopening of trade routes from Belarus to the EU, according to the Center. The trip will mark Lukashenko&apos;s third visit to China in three years. Lukashenko has been in power for 30 years and is seeking a seventh term on Jan. 26. The Belarusian presidential elections are not expected to be free or fair. When Belarus last held elections in 2020, mass protests broke out and the West condemned the election results as fraudulent. Lukashenko&apos;s regime quelled the protests in a large-scale crackdown on dissent.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-to-visit-china-ahead-of-belarus-presidential-elections/	2025-01-03T19:55:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1798852424.jpg
Finnish court upholds seizure of Russian tanker suspected of cable sabotage	The Helsinki District Court ruled on Jan. 3 to uphold Finland&apos;s seizure of the Russian Eagle S oil tanker, denying an appeal to release the ship and its crew. Finnish authorities allege the ship damaged a crucial undersea power cable, possibly in an act of sabotage. Estlink 2, a 170-kilometer (106-mile) cable connecting Estonia and Finland, was seriously damaged on Dec. 25. The Eagle S belongs to Russia&apos;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; a group of tankers Moscow uses to circumvent sanctions, including a Group of Seven (G7) price cap on Russian oil. The Helsinki District Court has ruled to keep the tanker under seizure, the Finnish news outlet Yle reported. Finnish police initially seized the tanker on Dec. 28, considering the vessel to be evidence in a criminal investigation. Caravella LLC FZ, the ship&apos;s United Arab Emirates-based owner, applied to the court to have the seizure lifted. Police requested the trial be held in secret and court documents kept confidential. Finnish investigators are currently interrogating Eagle S crew members about the alleged incident. Authorities expect the initial phase of the investigation to last several weeks, and for the entire investigation to conclude in several months. Three Finnish companies are also demanding the seizure of the tanker in order to secure compensation for damage to the cable. These include national grid operator Fingrid, telecommunications firm Elisa, and state-owned network company Cinia. Following the cable incident, NATO pledged to enhance its military presence in the Baltic Sea. Finland joined the military alliance in early 2o23 in response to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/finnish-court-continues-seizure-of-russian-shadow-fleet-tanker-over-suspected-cable-sabotage/	2025-01-03T18:31:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1822474446.jpg
EU chief von der Leyen ill with 'severe' pneumonia, cancels engagements	European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has canceled upcoming engagements due to a case of pneumonia, Commission spokesperson Stefan de Keersmaecker said on Jan. 3. Von der Leyen, 66, has led the executive body of the European Union since 2019. She has positioned herself as a staunch supporter of Ukraine throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. &quot;The president has canceled her external engagements for the first two weeks of January. She is dealing with a severe pneumonia,&quot; de Keersmaecker said. &quot;The canceled appointments include a speech in Lisbon and the scheduled trip to Gdansk on the occasion of the launch of the Polish Council presidency, which will take place at a later stage.&quot; The spokesperson did not provide any further details on von der Leyen&apos;s condition. Poland on Jan. 1 took over the rotating presidency of the EU Council, replacing Hungary in the role. An event launching the Polish presidency was held in Warsaw on Jan. 3.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-chief-von-der-leyen-ill-with-severe-pneumonia-cancels-engagements/	2025-01-03T17:33:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1662120631.jpeg
Moldova faces 'security crisis' after Russian gas shut-off, PM Recean says	Russia&apos;s decision to cut off gas supplies to Moldova has thrown the country into a &quot;security crisis,&quot; Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean said on Jan. 3. The Russian state energy company Gazprom halted gas deliveries to Moldova on Jan. 1, triggering an energy emergency in the Russian-occupied breakaway region of Transnistria. The region now risks industrial collapse due to widespread power outages. &quot;By jeopardizing the future of the protectorate it has backed for three decades in an effort to destabilize Moldova, Russia is revealing the inevitable outcome for all its allies &#x2014; betrayal and isolation,&quot; Recean said in a statement. &quot;We treat this as a security crisis aimed at enabling the return of pro-Russian forces to power in Moldova and weaponizing our territory against Ukraine, with whom we share a 1,200-km border.&quot; Russian troops have occupied Transnistria since the early 1990s. While the rest of Moldova switched to European energy supplies after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the region remains heavily dependent on Russian gas. Gazprom&apos;s suspension has left nearly 75,000 households without gas and another 116,000 with reduced supply, according to Sergey Obolonik, the first deputy chairman of the Transnistrian administration. Transnistria has initiated rolling blackouts to mitigate the crisis. While Moldova offered to assist Transnistria in purchasing alternatives to Russian gas via the European market, authorities in the region refused, saying they believed Gazprom would resume deliveries. Gazprom has said that the decision to cut off gas to Moldova resulted from outstanding debts, an allegation Chisinau disputes. A deal allowing Russian gas to transit to Europe through Ukraine also expired on Jan. 1, but Gazprom did not cite transit issues as the reason for the suspension. Moldova could still receive Russian gas supplies via alternative routes. Chisinau has repeatedly accused Moscow of attemping to destabilize the country in order to bring Moldova under Russian control.	https://kyivindependent.com/moldova-faces-security-crisis-after-russian-gas-shut-off-pm-recean-says/	2025-01-03T16:20:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2173939066.jpg
China may have stopped Putin from using nuclear weapons, Blinken says	China may have talked Russian President Vladimir Putin out of deploying nuclear weapons amid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in an interview with the Financial Times (FT) on Jan. 3. Beijing has emerged as Moscow&apos;s leading ally and financial backer since the full-scale invasion of February 2022, though China has denied accusations of supporting Russia&apos;s military efforts. China may have exerted its influence over Russia to intervene when Putin was considering nuclear escalation, Blinken told the FT. &quot;We have reason to believe that China engaged Russia and said: &apos;Don&apos;t go there,&apos;&quot; he said. Blinken said the U.S. had been &quot;very concerned&quot; because Putin appeared to be considering nuclear weapons. &quot;Even if the probability went from 5 to 15%, when it comes to nuclear weapons, nothing is more serious,&quot; he said. Blinken also claimed that China may have intervened in a similar manner after the U.S. warned Beijing that Putin was planning to launch a nuclear weapon into space. Fear of escalating hostilities with nuclear-armed Russia has been a driving factor behind the current U.S. administration&apos;s policy toward Ukraine. Under President Joe Biden, the White House delayed deliveries of certain weapons and withheld permission for Kyiv to launch deep strikes within Russian territory, citing Putin&apos;s &quot;red lines.&quot; Putin began a new round of nuclear saber-rattling in late November after Biden allowed Ukraine to attack some Russian targets with U.S.-made long-range weapons. Putin revised Russia&apos;s nuclear doctrine, expanding the criteria under which the country can launch a nuclear strike. Despite these steps, U.S. intelligence sources have said that the risk of a Russian nuclear strike has not increased and remains unlikely. Blinken defended Biden&apos;s record on Russia and Ukraine, saying that Putin suffered a &quot;strategic defeat&quot; and that NATO has grown stronger. Biden&apos;s term ends later this month when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Republican Senator Marco Rubio will replace Blinken as secretary of state.	https://kyivindependent.com/china-may-have-stopped-putin-from-using-nuclear-weapons-blinken-says/	2025-01-03T15:15:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170662132.jpg
Transnistria rejects offer to buy gas from Europe, expects Russia to resume supplies	The Russian-occupied Transnistria region of Moldova has rejected Chisinau&apos;s offer to help the region purchase gas via European platforms, Vadim Cheban, head of the state energy company Moldovagaz, said on Jan. 3. Transnistria instead expects Russia&apos;s Gazprom will resume deliveries of natural gas, Cheban told the news outlet IPN. Russia&apos;s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom halted gas deliveries to Moldova on Jan. 1, citing alleged unpaid debts by Moldovagaz. The suspension triggered an energy crisis in Transnistria, which now faces industrial collapse due to widespread power outages. Authorities in Transnistria do not want to purchase gas from the West, claiming this would involve &quot;higher and unstable&quot; energy prices, Cheban said. Moldova had previously offered to assist Transnistria in securing energy resources via European platforms to mitigate the crisis. Transnistrian officials rejected the offer and said they believe Gazprom will resume Russian gas supplies, Cheban reported. Russian troops have occupied Transnistria since the early 1990s. While the rest of Moldova has switched to European energy supplies, the region is heavily dependent on Russian gas. Although a deal allowing Russian gas to transit through Ukraine expired on the same day that Russia halted gas supplies to Moldova, Gazprom insists the suspension is due to Moldova&apos;s outstanding debt, not transit issues. Moldovan officials dispute Gazprom&apos;s claims regarding outstanding payments, noting an international audit failed to verify the debts. Sergey Obolonik, the first deputy chairman of the Transnistrian administration, called the energy crisis in the region &quot;grave,&quot; saying that shortages have left nearly 75,000 households without gas and another 116,000 with reduced supply.	https://kyivindependent.com/transnistria-rejects-offer-to-buy-gas-from-europe-expects-russia-to-resume-supplies/	2025-01-03T14:06:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1237153625.jpg
We are not Russia' — Thousands protest Fico's pro-Kremlin agenda in Bratislava	Thousands of people gathered in the streets of Bratislava on Jan. 3 to protest Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico&apos;s pro-Russian policies, the Slovak news outlet Aktuality reported. The demonstrations began less than two weeks after Fico visited Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, and just days after Ukraine stopped the flow of Russian gas to Europe via its territory. Fico lambasted Kyiv for halting gas transit, threatening to cut off energy supplies to Ukraine and end aid to Ukrainian refugees amid the ongoing full-scale war. Approximately 4,000 people assembled in Bratislava to protest Fico&apos;s Kremlin-friendly stance, Aktuality reported. Demonstrators waved the flags of Slovakia and the European Union, chanting &quot;We are not Russia.&quot; Protesters played the EU anthem and carried posters labeled &quot;We are Europe.&quot; &quot;Fico, go to Moscow, leave Slovakia in peace,&quot; one banner reportedly read. The Slovak artist Rudolf Sikora, one of the lead speakers at the protest, called on opposition parties to unite with activists and civil associations against the threat of Russian influence. &quot;I beg you, opposition politicians, come together sensibly,&quot; he said. Fico, a pro-Russian populist, won Slovakia&apos;s parliamentary elections in September 2023. It is his fourth time at the helm of the Slovak government. Before Fico&apos;s return to power, Slovakia had been a staunch supporter of Ukraine. It was the first country to send Kyiv fighter jets after the full-scale invasion and a reliable supplier of military aid. Fico&apos;s government initiated a stark policy reversal, halting weapons deliveries to Ukraine and adopting rhetoric blaming the West for Russia&apos;s war. Fico also has close ties to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, another Central European populist leader with friendly attitudes toward Putin. Tensions between Bratislava and Kyiv have escalated due to President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s decision to allow a pre-war agreement on Russian gas transit via Ukraine to expire without renewal on Dec. 31, 2024. Ukraine terminated the transit deal on Jan. 1, after repeatedly warning it would not renew gas transit in order to avoid financing Russia&apos;s war machine. In retaliation, Fico on Jan. 2 threatened to reduce aid to Ukrainian refugees living in Slovakia. He has also threatened to cut off electricity supplies to Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-are-not-russia-thousands-protest-ficos-pro-kremlin-agenda-in-bratislava/	2025-01-03T12:59:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190596481.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russian envoy dismisses Trump’s reported peace deal; Over 50,000 Russians seek soldiers MIA	Key developments on Jan. 3: More than 50,000 inquiries have been submitted by Russians seeking missing soldiers through Ukraine&#x2019;s &quot;I Want to Find&quot; project, Bohdan Okhrimenko, head of the Coordination Center Secretariat, said in an interview with ArmyInform on Jan. 3. &quot;These numbers only reflect those unafraid to contact us,&quot; Okhrimenko said, adding that there actual number of Russian soldiers missing in action can be much higher. Initially part of the &quot;I Want to Live&quot; hotline &#x2014; launched in September 2022 by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) to help Russian soldiers surrender &#x2014; the separate &quot;I Want to Find&quot; project was created to handle inquiries from Russian families about missing soldiers. Okhrimenko criticized Russia&#x2019;s lack of effort in recovering or identifying the missing, saying, &quot;Many remain scattered in Ukrainian fields, their remains carried by stray animals. Russia shows no interest in identifying them.&quot; Earlier, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Anna Tsivilyova disclosed on Nov. 26 that her ministry received 48,000 DNA test applications from relatives seeking information about missing soldiers. Speaking at a Duma roundtable, Tsivilyova revealed that relatives&apos; DNA data had been collected and stored in a database, inadvertently providing a rare glimpse into the scale of troops missing in action. Andrei Kartapolov, head of the State Duma&apos;s defense committee, warned against publicizing such figures, saying, &quot;This is sensitive information. When we finalize the documents, we must ensure these figures do not appear publicly.&quot; The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 3 that Russia has lost 793,250 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s team has not presented anything &quot;interesting&quot; to Moscow regarding ending the war in Ukraine, Russia&apos;s envoy to the U.N., Vasily Nebenzya, said on Jan. 3. Earlier reports from the Wall Street Journal indicated that Trump&#x2019;s team is considering a plan to delay Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for continued Western arms supplies and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire. Nebenzya dismissed these ideas as &quot;unformed, vague signals&quot; and reiterated Moscow&#x2019;s position against freezing the conflict. &quot;President (Vladimir) Putin last outlined our conditions for ending the conflict on Dec. 19. So far, nothing from the incoming U.S. administration suggests anything of interest to us,&quot; Nebenzya said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov expressed dissatisfaction with Trump&#x2019;s reported peace deal proposals on Dec. 29, saying that Moscow rejects any plan that fails to meet its demands. Despite Trump&#x2019;s claims of achieving peace &quot;within 24 hours,&quot; his team has yet to provide an official roadmap for ending the war. Germany should not rule out deploying Bundeswehr troops to Ukraine after the war ends, Roderich Kiesewetter, a lawmaker from the opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said on Jan. 3. Kiesewetter&apos;s remarks come amid reports that the U.K. and France are considering sending troops to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. Proposals for European states to deploy millitry personnel to Ukraine are reportedly included in U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s peace plan. Kiesewetter argued that as Europe&#x2019;s largest economy, Germany has a responsibility to contribute significantly to European security and peacekeeping efforts. He said that Germany must be ready to intervene in Ukraine &quot;at the appropriate time with well-equipped troops&quot; and warned against dismissing such a possibility. Kiesewetter noted that any German peacekeeping involvement would need to occur under joint EU and NATO frameworks to ensure operational effectiveness and align with existing European security structures. &quot;A peacekeeping force is effective and realistic if integrated into NATO, as the nuclear umbrella would extend to Ukraine,&quot; he said. Friedrich Merz, the CDU/CSU alliance&apos;s chancellor candidate, said on Dec. 28 that Germany could join a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine but only with Russia&#x2019;s consent. Ukraine will not hold elections under martial law even if Russia puts it forward as one of the pre-conditions for negotiations, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview on Ukrainian television released on Jan. 2. Ukraine was scheduled to hold a presidential election in March or April 2024, concluding Zelensky&apos;s first five-year term. The vote was postponed as the country&apos;s constitution does not permit elections under martial law, which was declared on Feb. 24, 2022, at the onset of Russia&apos;s all-out invasion. Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to use the delay to portray Zelensky as &quot;illegitimate,&quot; saying that the authority should pass to Parliament Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk, a claim rejected by Kyiv as a distortion of the constitution. In the interview, Zelensky reiterated that presidential and parliamentary elections are not possible under martial law and that the elected officials continue to legally perform their duties until the next vote. After Ukraine manages to end the hot stage of the war, maintains a strong army, and secures powerful security guarantees, martial law can be lifted, and the parliament can set a date for the elections, the president said. &quot;After martial law ends, there is no need to wait years for the elections,&quot; Zelensky added. Ukraine&apos;s State Bureau of Investigation has launched a probe into suspected desertion and abuse of authority in the French-trained 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Mechanized Brigade, the bureau confirmed to Suspilne on Jan. 2. The statement comes following a media investigation that claimed that soldiers of the unit, now deployed near Pokrovsk, have suffered losses and went AWOL (absent without leave) in large numbers due to poor command and organization on Ukraine&apos;s side. The brigade is a flagship project under which Kyiv&apos;s partners will help train new Ukrainian military formations and provide heavy equipment. The training of the 155th Brigade, named after an 11th-century Kyiv princess and spouse to French King Henry I, was announced by French President Emmanuel Macron in June. The unit has about 5,800 troops, fewer than 2,000 of whom have undergone training in France. It is armed with French AMX10 armored vehicles, Caesar howitzers, and German Leopard 2A4 tanks, among other weapons. France fulfilled its obligations regarding training and arms, said Yurii Butusov, the chief editor of the Censor.net outlet, in the media investigation, putting the blame for the unit&apos;s problems on top Ukrainian military and political leadership. According to the journalist, the unit&apos;s founding was an &quot;organizational chaos&quot; since the very beginning. Even before the training in France began, 2,500 service members were reportedly sent to other units, thus removing many of the most qualified personnel from the brigade. Of the 1,924 soldiers eventually sent to France, only 51 had more than a year of military service, while 1,414 had served for less than two months, Butusov wrote. The unit was also plagued by large numbers of soldiers going AWOL &#x2014; about 50 deserted in France, in addition to hundreds who left their posts even before the unit was deployed at the front, according to the journalist. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Around 38% of Ukrainians are open to conceding some of the territories while preserving independence in order to end the war with Russia as fast as possible, according to the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) survey published on Jan. 3. The poll comes amid growing expectations of possible peace talks in 2025 as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to bring Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table. The responses, collected between Dec. 2 and 17, 2024, show a moderate increase since October, when 32% of the respondents were willing to compromise on territorial integrity for a faster peace deal. Only 19% agreed with the statement in December 2023 and 8% in December 2022, making the December 2024 figures the highest since the KIIS began the measurements in May 2022. The all-out war, which will mark its third anniversary in less than two months, has put a massive strain on the Ukrainian state, society, and the military, while the Russian offensive has picked up pace in recent months. Comparatively, 51% of respondents in December 2024 said that Ukraine should not give up any of its territories &quot;under no circumstances... even if this would prolong the war and threaten the preservation of independence.&quot; This is a drop from 58% in October 2024, 74% in December 2023, and 85% in December 2022. The question did not specify which territories could be given up nor whether they should be officially recognized as Russian territory or &quot;merely&quot; remain temporarily under Russian occupation. The survey involved 2,000 respondents across Ukraine-controlled territories who were interviewed via phone.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-over-50-000-russians-seek-mia-through-ukraines-project/	2025-01-03T12:13:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1249450973.jpg
Nothing of interest' — Russian envoy dismisses Trump’s reported peace deal proposals on Ukraine	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s team has not presented anything &quot;interesting&quot; to Moscow regarding ending the war in Ukraine, Russia&apos;s envoy to the U.N., Vasily Nebenzya, said on Jan. 3 in an interview with the state-controlled Rossiya-1 TV channel. Earlier reports from the Wall Street Journal indicated that Trump&#x2019;s team is considering a plan to delay Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for continued Western arms supplies and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire.

So far, nothing from the incoming U.S. administration suggests anything of interest to us,&quot; Nebenzya said. On Dec. 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin reiterated his willingness to engage in dialogue with Trump but upheld Moscow&#x2019;s demands, including the desire to fully occupy four Ukrainian regions &#x2014; Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson &#x2014; and a rejection of Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership. Nebenzya also claimed to have received &quot;signals of agreements&quot; from Ukraine, though he rejected them as unserious. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov expressed dissatisfaction with Trump&#x2019;s reported peace deal proposals on Dec. 29, saying that Moscow rejects any plan that fails to meet its demands.

Ukraine hits $24.5 billion in agro-exports, nearing pre-war levels, Agriculture Ministry reports	Ukraine&apos;s agricultural exports reached $24.5 billion in 2024, accounting for 59% of the country&#x2019;s total exports, the Agriculture Ministry reported on Jan. 3. This marks a significant recovery, nearing pre-war levels and achieving the second-highest record after 2021&#x2019;s $27.7 billion. Ukraine, a global agricultural powerhouse, exported 78.3 million tons of products in 2024, including grains and sunflower seeds critical to markets across Africa and Asia. Sunflower oil led the exports at 21%, with nearly 6 million tons worth $5.1 billion. Corn matched this share, with 29.6 million tons exported for $5 billion. Wheat followed at 15%, totaling 20.6 million tons worth $3.7 billion. Other notable exports included rapeseed (7%, $1.8 billion), soybeans (5%, $1.3 billion), and oilcake and residues (4%, $1 billion). Meat and poultry products accounted for 4% ($958 million), while barley and sugar each made up 2% of exports at $557 million and $418 million, respectively. Throughout Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war, Moscow has sought to obstruct Ukraine&#x2019;s agricultural exports, blockading the Black Sea and attempting to replace Ukrainian products in global markets with its own, including grain looted from occupied territories. Despite these challenges, Ukraine reopened a maritime trade corridor in 2023, enabling the revival of its agricultural exports.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hits-24-5-billion-in-agro-exports-nearing-pre-war-levels-agriculture-ministry-reported/	2025-01-03T11:10:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1242186203.jpg
Ukrainian Navy ensures safe passage for over 9,000 vessels through sea corridor in 2024, Navy Commander says	The Ukrainian Navy facilitated the safe passage of 9,061 civilian vessels through its sea corridor in 2024, Navy Commander Oleksii Neizhpapa said on Jan. 3. Following Russia&apos;s termination of the grain deal in July 2023, Ukraine opened a new corridor in August, initially aimed at evacuating ships stranded since the start of the full-scale war. It has since evolved into a critical trade route. Neizhpapa said that 4,651 vessels arrived in Ukraine, while 4,410 departed for other ports, enabling the export of over 74.4 million tons of cargo, including agricultural products. &quot;This is vital for Ukraine&#x2019;s economy and global food security, as nearly 80% of goods are transported by sea,&quot; he said. Navigating the route remains dangerous due to persistent threats of Russian attacks and drifting mines. Neizhpapa credited the Navy&#x2019;s continuous efforts, including destroying numerous mines and escorting cargo ships, for maintaining safety. &quot;Not a single sea mine explosion occurred in ports, thanks to our personnel and divers,&quot; he said. Ukraine&#x2019;s maritime trade route has been targeted by Russia, including a Sept. 12 missile attack on a cargo ship carrying Ukrainian wheat to Egypt. The vessel was hit while sailing in Romania&#x2019;s exclusive economic zone, 55 kilometers from the Romanian port of Sfantu Gheorghe, according to Romania&apos;s Coast Guard. The Ukrainian Navy continues its efforts to ensure safe navigation and uphold Ukraine&#x2019;s position in the global maritime market.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-navy-ensures-safe-passage-for-over-9-000-vessels-through-sea-corridor-in-2024-navy-commander-says/	2025-01-03T10:26:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1839572541.jpg
Russian missile attack on Chernihiv kills 1, injures 4	Russia launched a ballistic missile attack on Chernihiv on Jan. 3, killing one person and injuring four others, Chernihiv Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Chaus said. The attack targeted a residential area on the outskirts of Chernihiv, causing significant damage to multiple apartment buildings, Chaus said. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force had warned of the incoming ballistic attack earlier in the day. Search and rescue operations are ongoing. Chernihiv Oblast, situated on Ukraine&apos;s northern border with Russia, was partially occupied during the early stages of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Although Russian forces withdrew from the region in April 2022, Chernihiv remains under near-daily attack due to its proximity to the border.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-on-chernihiv-kills-1-injures-4/	2025-01-03T09:24:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-03_17-45-25.jpg
Rolling blackouts begin in Russian-occupied Transnistria amid gas shortages, local authorties say	Authorities in Russian-occupied Transnistria began rolling blackouts on Jan. 3 after Russia&#x2019;s suspension of gas exports caused emergency power outages, the so-called economic development ministry announced. Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom halted gas deliveries to Moldova on Jan. 1, citing alleged unpaid debts by Moldovagaz. Moldovan officials dispute the claim, noting an international audit failed to verify the debts. While a transit agreement for Russian gas through Ukraine also expired on the same day, Gazprom maintains that Moldova&#x2019;s debts, not transit issues, prompted the suspension. The blackouts, aimed at reducing energy consumption, will last an hour in the evenings across main cities &#x2014; Tiraspol, Rybnitsa, and Bender &#x2014; and several villages. Transnistria, home to approximately 370,000 residents, has been heavily affected, with widespread heating outages reported. In January, the average temperature in Transnistria can drop to -5 &#xB0;C (24&#xB0;F) at night. Sergey Obolonik, the first deputy chairman of the Transnistrian administration, called the crisis &quot;grave,&quot; saying that shortages have left nearly 75,000 households without gas and another 116,000 with reduced supply. Prolonged disruptions could cause &quot;irreversible damage&quot; to the region&#x2019;s industrial capacity, he warned. Moldova has offered to help Transnistria purchase gas through European platforms. Vadim Cheban, head of Moldovagaz, said on Jan. 2 that Chisinau is ready to assist Transnistrian authorities in securing energy resources on market terms to mitigate the crisis. Russian troops have occupied Transnistria since the early 1990s.	https://kyivindependent.com/rolling-blackouts-begin-in-russian-occupied-transnistria-amid-gas-shortages-ministry-says/	2025-01-03T08:57:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1686320111-1.jpg
Over 50,000 Russians seek MIA through Ukraine’s project, representative says	More than 50,000 inquiries have been submitted by Russians seeking missing soldiers through Ukraine&#x2019;s &quot;I Want to Find&quot; project, Bohdan Okhrimenko, head of the Coordination Center Secretariat, said in an interview with ArmyInform on Jan. 3. &quot;These numbers only reflect those unafraid to contact us,&quot; Okhrimenko said, adding that there actual number of Russian soldiers missing in action can be much higher. Initially part of the &quot;I Want to Live&quot; hotline &#x2014; launched in September 2022 by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) to help Russian soldiers surrender &#x2014; the separate &quot;I Want to Find&quot; project was created to handle inquiries from Russian families about missing soldiers. Okhrimenko criticized Russia&#x2019;s lack of effort in recovering or identifying the missing, saying, &quot;Many remain scattered in Ukrainian fields, their remains carried by stray animals. Russia shows no interest in identifying them.&quot; Earlier, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Anna Tsivilyova disclosed on Nov. 26 that her ministry received 48,000 DNA test applications from relatives seeking information about missing soldiers. Speaking at a Duma roundtable, Tsivilyova revealed that relatives&apos; DNA data had been collected and stored in a database, inadvertently providing a rare glimpse into the scale of troops missing in action. Andrei Kartapolov, head of the State Duma&apos;s defense committee, warned against publicizing such figures, saying, &quot;This is sensitive information. When we finalize the documents, we must ensure these figures do not appear publicly.&quot; The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 3 that Russia has lost 793,250 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-50-000-russians-seek-missing-soldiers-through-ukraines-project/	2025-01-03T08:07:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1253226504.jpg
Germany should not rule out peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, CDU lawmaker says	Germany should not rule out deploying Bundeswehr troops to Ukraine after the war ends, Roderich Kiesewetter, a lawmaker from the opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said on Jan. 3, Schw&#xE4;bische Zeitung reported. Kiesewetter&apos;s remarks come amid reports that the U.K. and France are considering sending troops to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. Proposals for European states to deploy millitry personnel to Ukraine are reportedly included in U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s peace plan. Kiesewetter argued that as Europe&#x2019;s largest economy, Germany has a responsibility to contribute significantly to European security and peacekeeping efforts. He said that Germany must be ready to intervene in Ukraine &quot;at the appropriate time with well-equipped troops&quot; and warned against dismissing such a possibility. Kiesewetter noted that any German peacekeeping involvement would need to occur under joint EU and NATO frameworks to ensure operational effectiveness and align with existing European security structures. &quot;A peacekeeping force is effective and realistic if integrated into NATO, as the nuclear umbrella would extend to Ukraine,&quot; he said. Friedrich Merz, the CDU/CSU alliance&apos;s chancellor candidate, said on Dec. 28 that Germany could join a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine but only with Russia&#x2019;s consent. Merz underscored the necessity of a clear international legal mandate for German participation in such operations. During a Dec. 9 visit to Kyiv, Merz pledged a more assertive stance on arming Ukraine and highlighted Germany&#x2019;s potential role in peacekeeping. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine would only consider foreign peacekeepers if it secures a clear timeline for NATO membership. Ukrainian officials maintain that NATO membership is essential for lasting peace. While full membership is unlikely amid the ongoing war, Kyiv has urged NATO allies to extend an invitation as a signal of support.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-should-not-rule-out-peacekeeping-mission-in-ukraine-cdu-lawmaker-says/	2025-01-03T07:30:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169569133.jpg
Polish farmers protest in Warsaw against Ukrainian imports, EU policies	Polish farmers launched a protest in Warsaw on Jan. 3 against agricultural imports from Ukraine and the EU policies they claim are threatening their livelihoods, the RMF24 news outlet reported. The protest follows a series of demonstrations by Polish farmers against Ukrainian agricultural imports after the EU lifted tariffs on goods from Ukraine in 2022. The most recent rally, which coincides with the inauguration of the Polish presidency of the Council of the EU, is held under the slogan &quot;Five times STOP.&quot; The five issues that sparked the protest include Ukrainian imports, the European bloc&apos;s trade deal with the Mercosur group of South American countries, the Green Deal, the EU policies on forests and hunting, and the perceived &quot;extinction of the Polish economy.&quot; The protests began at 2 p.m. local time in front of the European Commission representation building on Jasna Street. Approximately two hours later, the farmers will hold a march through the city and conclude the event at 11 p.m. &quot;All agricultural organizations in our country will protest against the harmful policies of the European Union, against (European Commission President) Ursula von der Leyen, who is imposing policies that will force closure of our farms,&quot; said Tomasz Obszanski, chairman of the Independent Farmers&apos; Trade Union Solidarnosc (Solidarity). Polish farmers and truckers launched their largest protests in late 2023 and early 2024, blocking off cargo traffic at the Polish-Ukrainian border. Most recently, on Nov. 23, farmers staged a blockade at the Shehyni border crossing with Ukraine, which lasted just over a day and restricted truck traffic. Warsaw has already implemented import bans on certain Ukrainian products, such as grain, citing negative impacts on Polish agriculture. The Polish government has expressed support for farmers&#x2019; concerns, highlighting challenges posed by the EU&#x2019;s trade policies while also seeking to maintain solidarity with Ukraine during the ongoing war.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-farmers-protest-in-warsaw-against-ukrainian-imports-eu-policies/	2025-01-03T06:01:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1949617243.jpg
Ukraine aims to raise over $1 billion for 'Danish model' of defense industry funding in 2025	Ukraine is planning to raise more than $1 billion in 2025 to develop the so-called Danish model of funding for Ukraine&apos;s defense production, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Jan. 3. Denmark became the first country to offer to donate arms to Ukraine via direct purchases from the Ukrainian defense industry, as Kyiv&apos;s defense budget does not match the capacities of domestic weapons production. Shmyhal also said that Ukraine aims to expand its domestic defense production capacity to $30 billion next year. &quot;The Danish model of cooperation is not only solidarity but also determination to support our struggle for freedom and sovereignty,&quot; said Deputy Defense Minister Dmytro Klimenkov. Last year, Ukraine produced 18 domestically-developed Bohdana self-propelled howitzers financed by Copenhagen. Kyiv has so far received over 150 million euros ($156 million) in funding from Denmark, France, and Lithuania to bolster its defense industry, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said in late December.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-aims-to-raise-over-1-billion-for-danish-model-in-2025/	2025-01-03T05:56:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-2038537930.jpg
Ukraine state-owned enterprises weekly — Issue 159	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This is issue 159 of Ukrainian State-Owned Enterprises Weekly, covering events from Dec. 15-22, 2024. The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission. Updated IMF Memorandum. On Dec. 20, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) published an updated Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) following its sixth review under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program for Ukraine. Ukraine&#x2019;s commitment related to state-owned banks is as follows: As we reported in Issue 116, foreign investors had shown interest in acquiring Ukrgasbank and Sense Bank. There are also several commitments related to SOEs that were not included as structural benchmarks: Energoatom&#x2019;s new supervisory board has not been operational for five months. In a comment to European Pravda on Dec. 16, Katarina Mathernova, EU Ambassador to Ukraine, emphasized the need to launch the full-fledged work of Energoatom&#x2019;s supervisory board, which was formally established in June 2024. &#x201C;I want to emphasize that we are very interested in the formation of the supervisory board of Energoatom. As G7, we sent a letter to Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal about this last week. The board was selected in June, and now is time to complete the process, sign contracts, and launch the supervisory board. Its view will be an important factor in the decisions on the financing of certain projects,&#x201D; Mathernova noted. On Dec. 18, Oleksii Sobolev, first deputy economy minister, said that the Cabinet of Ministers was awaiting the independent members of Energoatom&#x2019;s supervisory board, whose first meeting has been open since July 17, to take a position on contracts and to be ready to continue their work. &#x201C;On July 17, the supervisory board opened its first meeting, and it is still open as discussions on contracts continue. On Nov. 26, the Cabinet approved the terms of civil law contracts with Energoatom. Now they are with the independent members, and we are awaiting their position on whether they are prepared to sign them and continue working,&#x201D; Sobolev added. He also noted that the supervisory board members should elect a board chair at their first meeting. This is the first time that contracts have remained unsigned for such an extended period, he also added. &#x201C;The Cabinet put forward its own proposals, and board members made suggestions that occasionally contradicted the law. We tried to moderate and form a position that allowed us to make a decision on Nov. 26 and approve the contracts. I hope they will sign them now. I cannot disclose the details of the contracts as they are classified as documents for internal use only,&#x201D; Sobolev noted. When asked about the remuneration levels, Sobolev said they were in line with remunerations at other energy SOEs in Ukraine, such as Ukrenergo or Naftogaz, adding that the conditions for all board members (of Energoatom) were the same. The Cabinet approved the terms of the contracts with the independent and state-appointed members of Energoatom&#x2019;s supervisory board on Nov. 26. As we wrote in Issue 137, the Cabinet of Ministers approved all five board members on June 21: Timothy John Stone, Michael Elliott Kirst, and Jarek Neverovych as independent members, and Vitalii Petruk and Tymofiy Mylovanov, as state representatives nominated by the Energy Ministry. As we reported in September 2024, Energoatom&#x2019;s supervisory board was supposed to be launched by the end of July 2024, but this had not happened by that time (see our Issue 146). Forbes Ukraine then wrote that only Ukrainian members of the board had signed the contracts, while foreign independent members believed that the first meeting could only be held after the contracts were signed. In order not to violate the law, the first meeting was started within 30 days after board appointment, but the board had not made any decisions and could not complete the meeting, the media then wrote. During the Verkhovna Rada&#x2019;s meeting on Sept 6, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said that Energoatom&#x2019;s supervisory board had met &#x2014; the board meeting was opened. According to Halushchenko, contracts were being finalized, and the supervisory board was competent. See Issue 146 for more detail. Fitch affirms Naftogaz&#x2019;s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at &#x2018;CC.&apos; The company&#x2019;s senior unsecured notes issued by Kondor Finance plc have been affirmed at &#x2018;C.&apos; The Recovery Rating is &#x2018;RR6.&apos; Naftogaz&#x2019;s Standalone Credit Profile (SCP) remains at &#x2018;cc.&apos; According to Fitch, Naftogaz&#x2019;s &#x2018;CC&#x2019; IDR reflects the company&#x2019;s projected weak liquidity, due to very high operational risks in Ukraine amid the ongoing war with Russia, slow payments for gas, and limited external funding options. The agency said the key rating drivers included: On July 26, 2022, Naftogaz defaulted on its Eurobonds maturing in July 2022 and November 2026 due to the Cabinet of Ministers&#x2019; refusal to approve payments on them. See our Issue 68 for more detail. In February 2023, Naftogaz was trying to restructure these Eurobond liabilities with its financial advisor Lazard and legal advisor Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. See Issue 75 for detail. In May 2023, Naftogaz reached agreements with investors on ways to restructure its 2022 and 2026 Eurobonds. The restructuring of both was expected to be completed by the end of July 2023. See Issue 90 for more detail and the restructuring terms. The Cabinet of Ministers as the shareholder of Naftogaz agreed on the term sheet to restructure these Eurobonds on June 24. See Issue 95. In September 2023, Naftogaz reported that it had completed repayments to fulfill its credit obligations after the restructuring of the above Eurobonds. As a result, Naftogaz Group has officially exited default status, the company announced. See Issue 103. In July 2024, Naftogaz said it made timely payments on the restructured Eurobonds. See Issue 141. As we also reported in Issue 68, the government ordered Naftogaz to sell gas at a discount to multiple types of consumers, including households, heating companies, certain thermal power plants, non-household consumers from the defense sector, and regional gas distribution companies. Most of these obligations are linked to the duration of martial law. As we wrote in Issue 77, Naftogaz estimated its net losses in 2022 at Hr 40 billion (1.1 billion euros at the average exchange rate at the time). Then CEO Oleksii Chernyshov blamed significant receivables that arose due to the state&#x2019;s use of Naftogaz&#x2019;s working capital to meet the needs of energy consumers. He said that the underlying receivables of the company had three components: the difference in tariffs (Hr 36 billion, or 1.05 billion euros at the average exchange rate at the time), the debt of regional gas suppliers and gas distribution companies (Hr 76 billion, or 2.2 billion euros at the average exchange rate at the time), and public service obligations (PSOs) for 2022-2023 (Hr 158 billion, or 4.6 billion euros at the average exchange rate at the time).&#x202F;See Issue 77 for more detail. As we wrote in December 2023 (Issue 113), Ekonomichna Pravda (EP) wrote that, according to USAID, the total level of unsettled debts in the gas market exceeded Hr 190 billion (4.75 billion euros at the average exchange rate at the time) in early September 2023. According to the data of the National Energy and Utilities Regulatory Commission (NEURC) seen by EP, the total debt exceeded Hr 200 billion (5.1 billion euros at the average exchange rate at the time) as of Oct. 1, 202. &#x201C;Our goal is to gradually move to economically justified energy tariffs and cancel all PSOs by the fourth quarter of 2025. This should be done in conjunction with the systematic settlement of debts in the gas and district heating markets,&#x201D; Oleksandr Butenko, then Deputy Minister of Communities, Territories and Infrastructure, then explained. See Issue 113 for more detail. However, Naftogaz has recently kept the current gas tariff for households unchanged for at least another year. As before, customers can buy a cubic meter of gas for Hr 7.96 (including VAT). The tariff remains valid through April 30, 2025. See Issue 129 for more detail. Further gas supplies at a reduced tariff will likely result in corresponding losses for Naftogaz, even if heat and power producers pay for gas. Naftogaz Group pays over Hr 80 billion (1.8 billion euros) in taxes in January-November 2024, the company&#x2019;s press office said on Dec. 17. This includes Hr 74 billion (1.7 billion euros) paid to the state budget and Hr 6 billion (137 million euros) to local government budgets. In November alone, Naftogaz Group paid Hr 8.1 billion (184.5 million euros) in state taxes, and Hr 500 million (11.4 million euros) in local ones. As we reported earlier, Naftogaz Group paid the following taxes to state and local budgets in the course of 2024: Month&#xA0; Taxes paid to state and local budgets SOE Weekly details UAH Euros* January 6.1 billion 147 million Issue 119 February 5.3 billion 129 million Issue 123 March 8.3 billion 197 million Issue 128 April 8.0 billion 189 million Issue 132 May 9.3 billion 215 million Issue 137 June 9.2 billion 203 million Issue 140 July 6.0 billion 132 million Issue 143 August 7.2 billion 174 million Issue 148 September 5.8 billion 129 million Issue 152 October 5 billion 112 million Naftogaz&#x2019;s release November 8.6 billion 196 million This issue TOTAL 80 billion 1.8 billion This issue * Converted at the NBU&#x2019;s average exchange rate for the respective period. Calculations by SOE Weekly. As we reported in Issue 115, Naftogaz Group paid Hr 83.4 billion (2.1 billion euros) in taxes to the state budget and another Hr 6.8 billion (172 million euros) to local government budgets in 2023. The Group said that it made Hr 23.1 billion (584 million euros) in consolidated net profit in 2023, a significant rebound from its Hr 79.1 billion (2.3 billion euros) loss in 2022. See Issue 131 for more detail. As we wrote in Issue 149, Naftogaz Group made Hr 24.4 billion (578 million euros at the average exchange rate over that period) in consolidated net profit in the first six months of 2024. S&amp;P downgrades Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s credit rating to &#x2018;CC,&apos; citing the approaching default on Eurobonds. On Dec. 20, Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s (S&amp;P) downgraded Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s credit rating to &#x2018;CC&#x2019; (negative outlook) from &#x2018;CCC+&#x2019; following the company&#x2019;s proposal to defer repayment of two Eurobond issues for a year. S&amp;P highlighted a material weakening in Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s debt-repayment capacity, noting that a default on its debt is almost certain as per the agency&#x2019;s methodology. The negative outlook reflects the expectation that Ukrzaliznytsia is likely to implement its debt restructuring plans in the next few weeks, which would be tantamount to a default, the agency added. On Dec. 16, Ukrzaliznytsia asked its creditors to renegotiate repayment terms for two Eurobond series: $594.9 million at 8.25% (due in 2026) and $300 million at 7.875% (due in 2028). The company proposed that bondholders should approve raising an additional 99 million euros from the EBRD while deferring interest payments to bondholders on securities during 2025-2026. In return, Ukrzaliznytsia undertakes not to repay debts of more than $20 million to its other creditors (except for the EBRD) during this period. Ukrzaliznytsia explained that inflation and rising electricity and diesel prices were increasing pressure on its liquidity. The company announced that it asked the state to increase freight tariffs by 37%, which had not been raised in two and a half years. Ukrzaliznytsia also argued that it had suffered significant financial losses and infrastructure damage due to a full-scale Russian invasion. The holders of Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s Eurobonds could vote on the new terms until Dec. 27. The decision was set to be made at a meeting of bondholders scheduled for Dec. 31 in London, Forbes Ukraine added. According to Forbes Ukraine, the creditors had allowed Ukrzaliznytsia to restructure the debt on these bonds in 2022. As part of the restructuring, the repayment of the company&#x2019;s debt on Eurobonds issued in 2019 and 2021 totalling $895 million was postponed to 2026 and 2028, respectively. Coupon payments that were due in 2023-2024 are scheduled for January 2025. As we wrote in September, Ukrzaliznytsia made a profit of up to Hr 3 billion (70.5 million euros) in the first half of 2024, but lost Hr 600-700 million (13-15.5 million euros) in July 2024 due to a decline in profitable types of cargo. See Issue 146 for more detail. Ukrzaliznytsia receives a record 480 million euros in loans from the EBRD to purchase electric locomotives and install generators, the company said on Dec. 19. As part of the signed agreements, Ukrzaliznytsia would receive the 480 million euros under state guarantees to finance two critically important programs, the company explained. The first one is to upgrade Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s locomotive fleet, with the EBRD providing an 18-year loan of up to 300 million euros for the purchase of electric locomotives. The second program involves the construction of gas-fired power generation. The EBRD will allocate 180 million euros, with a 10-year loan, the company said. About 65 million euros in grant funds from donors will also be accumulated for the implementation of this project. A grant of about 12 million euros from the UK Government through the Energy Community has already been confirmed. In total, the company aims to purchase and install complete gas-piston power plants at its locations, which will be able to generate about 255 MW, Ukrzaliznytsia noted. As we wrote in July 2024, Ukrzaliznytsia aimed to invest 215 million euros in gas-fired power plants with a total capacity of up to 250 MW. This estimate did not include the cost of construction. The payback period was about five years. See Issue 139 for more detail. Later in July, we reported that Ukrzaliznytsia would receive a 43-million-euro grant from the EU to integrate Ukraine&#x2019;s railway system with the EU&#x2019;s. See Issue 142 for more detail. AEROC, previously owned by sanctioned Russian oligarch Andrey Molchanov, sold. On Dec. 19, the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) sold AEROC, one of the largest producers of aerated concrete products in Ukraine, for Hr 1.9 billion (43.1 million euros). The starting price of Hr 965 million (21.9 million euros) more than doubled during the auction. According to Prozorro.Sale, the winner is Trident Geoinvest Ukraine LLC, owned by businessman Gennadii Butkevych. Trident Geoinvest Ukraine&#x2019;s bid exceeded the second-highest bid by Professional Engineering Company LLC, owned by Ikram Djavadov (Hr 1.6 billion or 36 million euros), by almost Hr 300 million, and the third-highest bid by DC BC1 LLC, owned by Tom&#xE1;&#x161; Fiala (Hr 1.54 billion or ca. 35 million euros), by Hr 350 million. The sale of AEROC marks Ukraine&#x2019;s third online auction for a large-scale privatization asset in the Prozorro.Sale system, following the privatizations of the Ukraine Hotel and UMCC (see Issues 148 and 151 for more detail. As we wrote earlier, SPFU planned to privatise AEROC, previously owned by sanctioned Russian oligarch Andrei Molchanov. See our Issues 97, 100, 106, and 110 for more detail. On July 12, the Cabinet added AEROC to the large-scale privatization list. See Issue 140. According to Ekonomichna Pravda (EP) and PRO-Consulting, AEROC is one of the largest aerated concrete producers in Ukraine. The company owns two plants in Obukhiv and Berezan (Kyiv oblast), which have been idle since July 2022. The capacity of these plants exceeds 1 million cubic meters per year, while total aerated concrete production in Ukraine in 2020 was 4 million cubic meters. AEROC also has an unfinished plant in Stryi (Lviv oblast), EP added. The SPFU also said that the winner has 30 working days from the date of the auction to pay the lot price, and the sale and purchase agreement would only be signed after that payment. As of the end of June 2024, the company had wage arrears, budget arrears, and overdue accounts payable. The total amount of debt is more than Hr 110.8 million (2.5 million euros at the average exchange rate at the time), which the new owner also must repay. The new owner is also obliged to maintain the company&#x2019;s core business and may not lay out employees for six months, the SPFU added. [Trident Geoinvest Ukraine LLC is a part of Butkevych&#x2019;s BGV Group Management. &#x201C;AERO&#x421;&#x2019;s newly acquired plants would complement the group&#x2019;s strategic directions, which the company aims to actively expand in the upcoming years. BGV&#x2019;s investments are centered around energy, infrastructure development and restoration, and general development. The group&#x2019;s flagship company, BGV Development, is constructing five commercial and residential real estate projects in Zhytomyr and Kyiv,&#x201D; BGV Group said. The group added that Trident Geoinvest Ukraine LLC would maintain the business&#x2019;s core operations and settle all debt obligations, totalling Hr 110.8 million, within six months. The company plans to develop the enterprise under a new brand in the future. Gennadii Butkevych is also a co-owner of ATB-Market, Ukraine&#x2019;s largest supermarket chain measured by number of stores. He is also an owner and president of the Polissia football club.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-state-owned-enterprises-weekly-issue-159/	2025-01-03T05:46:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-821523200.jpg
Number of Ukrainians open to territorial concessions rises to 38%, poll shows	Around 38% of Ukrainians are open to conceding some of the territories while preserving independence in order to end the war with Russia as fast as possible, according to the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) survey published on Jan. 3. The poll comes amid growing expectations of possible peace talks in 2025 as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to bring Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table. The responses, collected between Dec. 2 and 17, 2024, show a moderate increase since October, when 32% of the respondents were willing to compromise on territorial integrity for a faster peace deal. Only 19% agreed with the statement in December 2023 and 8% in December 2022, making the December 2024 figures the highest since the KIIS began the measurements in May 2022. The all-out war, which will mark its third anniversary in less than two months, has put a massive strain on the Ukrainian state, society, and the military, while the Russian offensive has picked up pace in recent months. Comparatively, 51% of respondents in December 2024 said that Ukraine should not give up any of its territories &quot;under no circumstances... even if this would prolong the war and threaten the preservation of independence.&quot; This is a drop from 58% in October 2024, 74% in December 2023, and 85% in December 2022. The question did not specify which territories could be given up nor whether they should be officially recognized as Russian territory or &quot;merely&quot; remain temporarily under Russian occupation. The survey involved 2,000 respondents across Ukraine-controlled territories who were interviewed via phone. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine currently lacks the military strength to retake all of the occupied territories and that some regions, like Crimea, will have to be liberated through diplomacy. Ukraine&apos;s head of state also acknowledged the possibility of Ukraine&apos;s &quot;gradual&quot; accession to NATO, with Article 5 initially not extending to occupied territories but strictly rejected recognizing Russian occupation as legitimate. The Ukrainian military finds itself increasingly on the back foot as Russian forces continue pushing forward in Donetsk Oblast and Moscow occupies around 20% of Ukrainian territory in the east and south of the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/38-percent-ukrainians-territorial-concessions/	2025-01-03T04:58:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1244780383.jpg
Ukraine's largest steelmaker launches production of Patriot system armor	Engineers of Metinvest, Ukraine&#x2019;s largest steel producer, developed an armored protection for the control module of the Patriot air defense system, the company announced on Jan. 3. Ukraine has received at least three Patriot systems from Germany, one from the U.S., and one from Romania. Other countries, like the Netherlands and Spain, delivered individual launchers or missiles. Throughout the full-scale war, there were several reports of damage to Patriot systems during Russia&apos;s aerial attacks. Ukraine also uses mock-ups to protect the Patriots. &quot;In a month and a half, we created a project from scratch and made a shield from Metinvest&apos;s Ukrainian armor steel for the Patriot air defense system crew, which guarantees protection against debris damage to both the defenders and the air defense control center,&quot; said Oleksandr Myronenko, a COO of Metinvest Group. Weighing over 2.6 tons, the armor consists of nearly 200 elements, including armored steel plates up to 8 milimeters thick. According to the company, the weight of the armor does not affect the system&apos;s functionality or mobility. The company is also producing steel shields for T-64 and T-72 tanks, U.S.-made M1 Abrams tanks, and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, and is preparing to integrate shields into various Leopard 2 tank modifications.	https://kyivindependent.com/metinvest-armor-for-patriots/	2025-01-03T04:46:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-157737400.jpg
Poland didn't invite Orban, Hungarian envoy to EU presidency opening event	Poland has not invited Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Hungary&apos;s ambassador to the opening event of Warsaw&apos;s presidency of the EU Council on Jan. 3, Reuters reported, citing Polish Deputy European Affairs Minister Magdalena Sobkowiak-Czarnecka. The reason is Budapest granting political asylum to former Polish Deputy Justice Minister Marcin Romanowski, who is investigated at home for suspected misuse of funds. Though close partners under Poland&apos;s previous conservative government, Hungary and Poland have been increasingly at odds since the coalition of Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk took office in December 2023. &quot;When we invited guests to our gala almost a month ago, we invited the entire diplomatic corps,&quot; Sobkowiak-Czarnecka said. &quot;But after the situation with Minister Romanowski, (Polish Foreign) Minister (Radoslaw) Sikorski decided that the Hungarian ambassador is not a welcome guest in the theater today.&quot; Stark differences on key policy issues also aggravate the mounting tensions between Warsaw and Budapest. While Poland has supported Ukraine&apos;s resistance against Russian aggression throughout the full-scale war and took a pro-EU turn under Tusk, Orban&apos;s Hungary has opposed military aid to Kyiv and repeatedly clashed with Brussels over the rule of law issues. Poland began its sixth-month rotating presidency of the EU Council on Jan. 1, taking over the role from Hungary. Tusk said that security would be a &quot;top priority&quot; for Poland&apos;s presidency and pledged continued support for Ukraine. The Hungarian chairmanship was seen as controversial, namely due to Orban&apos;s visit to Moscow in July, which led to EU officials and leaders boycotting some of the Hungary-hosted EU events.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-not-inviting-hungary-eu-event/	2025-01-03T03:59:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2097682027.jpg
Russia plans to redeploy some arms, equipment from Syria to Libya, Ukraine's intel claims	Russia is planning to ship some military equipment and weapons from the Tartus naval base in Syria to Libya, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) claimed on Jan. 3. Rebels overthrew the Russia-backed regime of former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in early December. Amid the fall of Assad&apos;s rule, Russia has reportedly begun withdrawing its naval and military assets from Syria. Some mercenaries of Russia&apos;s Africa Corps are stationed at the Tartus base on the Mediterranean coast, HUR said. Russia&apos;s Africa Corps reportedly emerged in 2023 and consists of over 2,000 soldiers and officers, as well as experienced mercenaries, many of whom previously served in the Wagner Group. Africa Corps, sharing the name with Nazi World War II-era units in Africa, was likely previously deployed in Syria, Libya, Burkina Faso, and Niger. According to the agency, Russian large landing ships Ivan Gren and Alexander Otrakovsky, as well as the dry cargo ship Sparta, are scheduled to arrive in the Syrian port on Jan. 5. Two more Russian vessels &#x2014; the universal cargo vessel Sparta II and the tanker Ivan Skoblev &#x2014; are expected to arrive on Jan. 8. &quot;Russia plans to use the Sparta and Sparta II cargo ships to transport military equipment and weapons from Syria to Libya,&quot; HUR said. Another Russian warship, the frigate Admiral Golovko, is reportedly planning to refuel. Armored personnel carriers, presumably taken from Syria, had already been relocated to one of the airfields in Russia&apos;s Vladimir Oblast, the agency noted. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Earlier, HUR said that losing the Tartus and Khmeimim bases would significantly damage Russia&apos;s presence in the Middle East and solidify its defeat in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-planning-to-redeploy-some-weapons-military-material-from-syria-to-libya-ukraines-intel-claims/	2025-01-03T03:55:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2189980735.jpg
Ukrainians in Poland receive fake military summonses	Ukrainian men living in Poland have begun receiving fake military draft notices, threatening them with legal repercussions if they evade service, the Polish RMF24 news outlet reported on Jan. 3. Poland&apos;s Office for Foreigners, which the letter falsely attributes as the author, stressed that it did not issue the document and that its content is fake. Ukraine&apos;s Embassy in Warsaw also denied the document&apos;s authenticity. Almost 1 million Ukrainian refugees remain in Poland after they fled Russia&apos;s all-out invasion that broke out in February 2022. &quot;The Office for Foreigners emphasizes that it is not the author of such letters,&quot; the Polish government agency said, publishing a scanned copy of the letter written in Polish. A scanned copy of the fake letter in Polish sent to Ukrainian men in Poland, threatening them with legal reprecussions if they avoid military service. (Poland&apos;s Office for Foreigners)The authors impersonating the Polish authorities threaten the recipients with visits to the place of residence between Dec. 17-31 to bring the Ukrainian men to the relevant &quot;mobilization point in connection with the obligation to perform military service in Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces.&quot; The letter goes on to threaten the recipients with criminal reliability, including extradition, in case of draft evasion. It remains unclear who the real author of the letter is or how many Ukrainian men have received it. The Polish authorities previously signaled a willingness to help Kyiv bring military-age men back to their home country as Ukraine struggles to replenish its Armed Forces&apos; ranks. The EU rejected the idea of forcibly deporting Ukrainian men, and no member country has put forward such a proposal. Instead, Warsaw proposed ending social benefits for fighting-age Ukrainian men. Ukraine has also launched the new Ukrainian Legion in Poland, a volunteer unit manned by Ukrainians living in Poland and trained by the Polish Armed Forces. The unit&apos;s members can return to Poland after completing their service.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-in-poland-receiving-fake-military-summonses/	2025-01-03T02:57:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1620826063.jpg
Next Ramstein summit to be held on Jan. 9	The next Ramstein-format summit of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) will take place on Jan. 9, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported on Jan. 3, citing the U.S. Air Force. The meeting will be the first since the leader-level summit in Germany was postponed in October 2024 after U.S. President Joe Biden canceled his foreign trips to handle Hurricane Milton. No further details about the upcoming Ramstein summit have been provided. The meeting will take place as Russian troops continue to push forward in Donetsk Oblast, advancing near the key town of Pokrovsk. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff recorded 138 clashes on the battlefield over the past day. The U.S. is ramping up its military aid to Ukraine before Donald Trump takes office later this month. The latest security assistance package announced by the Biden administration in December was worth nearly $2.5 billion. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group is a U.S.-led group consisting of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The last Ramstein meeting on Sept. 6 was the group&apos;s 24th gathering since its establishment in April 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/next-ramstein-summit-to-be-held-on-jan-9-media-reports/	2025-01-03T02:06:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2096199937.jpg
Ukraine investigating French-trained brigade after reports of desertions, mismanagement	Ukraine&apos;s State Bureau of Investigation has launched a probe into suspected desertion and abuse of authority in the French-trained 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Mechanized Brigade, the bureau confirmed for Suspilne on Jan. 2. The statement comes following a media investigation that claimed that soldiers of the unit, now deployed near Pokrovsk, have suffered losses and went AWOL (absent without leave) in large numbers due to poor command and organization on Ukraine&apos;s side. The brigade is a flagship project under which Kyiv&apos;s partners will help train new Ukrainian military formations and provide heavy equipment. The training of the 155th Brigade, named after an 11th-century Kyiv Rus princess and spouse to French King Henry I, was announced by French President Emmanuel Macron in June. The unit has about 5,800 troops, fewer than 2,000 of whom have undergone training in France. It is armed with French AMX10 armored vehicles, Caesar howitzers, and German Leopard 2A4 tanks, among other weapons. France fulfilled its obligations regarding training and arms, said Yurii Butusov, the chief editor of the Censor.net outlet, in the media investigation, putting the blame for the unit&apos;s problems on top Ukrainian military and political leadership. According to the journalist, the unit&apos;s founding was an &quot;organizational chaos&quot; since the very beginning. Even before the training in France began, 2,500 service members were reportedly sent to other units, thus removing many of the most qualified personnel from the brigade. Of the 1,924 soldiers eventually sent to France, only 51 had more than a year of military service, while 1,414 had served for less than two months, Butusov wrote. The unit was also plagued by large numbers of soldiers going AWOL &#x2014; about 50 deserted in France, in addition to hundreds who left their posts even before the unit was deployed at the front, according to the journalist. Between March and November, over 1,700 soldiers had gone AWOL, Butusov claimed without providing evidence. Though the unit was replenished with new recruits, these often did not undergo &quot;proper selection process,&quot; the journalist added. The military laid the blame for desertions in France on the brigade&apos;s commander, Dmytro Riumshin, who was dismissed in early December alongside several other top officers. The new commanders were unaware of the problems plaguing the unit, adding to the confusion, Butusov wrote. The 155th Brigade did not reportedly receive drones or electronic warfare equipment from the Ukrainian command. This, in addition to poor organization and insufficient training, is said to have contributed to the losses the unit suffered once deployed in combat in November. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The French Defense Ministry declined to comment on the investigation when approached by the media. &quot;The investigation is ongoing. It is too early to talk about any preliminary results,&quot; the State Bureau of Investigation told Suspilne. The news comes amid growing calls for reform in the Ukrainian military leadership as Kyiv finds itself increasingly on the back foot in the war with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-investigating-french-trained-brigade/	2025-01-03T01:42:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2176905143.jpg
Russian court reportedly orders Yandex to block access to oil refinery's maps, photos over Ukrainian drone attacks	A Moscow court ordered Russia&apos;s most popular search engine Yandex to remove photos of an oil refinery in one of the Russian regions from online maps due to the threat of Ukrainian drone attacks, Russian state-controlled TASS news agency reported on Jan. 2, citing documents. According to the court&apos;s decision, Yandex must &quot;exclude information access&quot; to the refinery&apos;s infrastructure. Over the past year, Ukraine has launched a series of drone strikes targeting Russia&apos;s oil industry, which is a driver of Russia&apos;s economy and the main source of revenue for the Kremlin&apos;s war machine. The lawsuit was filed by an unnamed &quot;supervisory agency,&quot; which found information about all the refinery&apos;s facilities in the public domain. The facility&apos;s location was not disclosed. This is the first court decision that obliged the Russian tech giant to remove from public access photos and maps of a strategically important facility for the defense industry, according to TASS. The oil refinery plant &quot;operates in an uninterrupted mode, providing the needs of the Russian army and navy&quot; during the all-out war against Ukraine and was attacked four times by Ukrainian drones in 2024, resulting in damage to the company&apos;s infrastructure, the lawsuit said. The court ruled that open access to maps and photos of the refinery &quot;undermine the defense capability of the state&quot; and &quot;have a negative impact on the timely supply of materials&quot; to the Russian army, TASS wrote.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-court-orders-yandex-to-block-access-to-oil-refinerys-maps-photos-over-ukrainian-drone-attacks/	2025-01-03T01:27:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-459985760.jpg
Russia has recruited up to 180,000 convicts for war against Ukraine, Foreign Intelligence Service says	Russia has recruited 140,000 to 180,000 prisoners to fight in a full-scale war against Ukraine as of November 2024, Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Intelligence Service (SZRU) said on Jan. 2. Moscow has been recruiting convicts for its war since summer 2022, first under the auspices of the Wagner mercenary company and then directly under the Russian Defense Ministry. There were about 300,000-350,000 prisoners in Russian prisons in 2024, which is half as many as in 2014, according to the Ukrainian intelligence agency. &quot;The reason is the Russia-Ukraine war,&quot; the statement read. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify all the claims. A Russian government decree abolishing the one-time payment of $3,524 to prisoners for signing a contract with the Russian Defense Ministry to participate in the war against Ukraine came into effect on Jan. 1. &quot;The legislative abolition of the one-time payment is evidence of the deepening crisis in the Russian economy and the shortage of financial resources,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Intelligence Service claimed. Prisoners and their relatives are deprived of a number of payments and benefits received by members of volunteer formations. Salaries of prisoners are also two to four times lower than that of other Russian soldiers, the agency said. Dozens of men convicted of violent crimes were allowed to return to Russia following their service. In some cases, these ex-convicts were accused of new crimes.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-recruits-up-to-180-000-convicts-for-war-against-ukraine-foreign-intelligence-service-says/	2025-01-02T23:57:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1576124699.jpg
Kursk incursion had 'big impact' on Global South countries, Zelensky says	Ukraine&apos;s incursion in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast is a &quot;very strong trump card in any negotiations,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview on Ukrainian television released on Jan. 2. &quot;Especially with countries that are very important for us, the countries of the Global South,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;I never thought it would have such a big impact on them because they were so influenced by the idea of &apos;invincible Russia.&apos;&quot; Russia has been ramping up its efforts to push Ukraine out of the embattled Kursk Oblast as Kyiv continues to hold on to a piece of Russian territory in the hopes of leveraging it in possible negotiations. There are growing expectations of possible peace talks in 2025 as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who will take office on Jan. 20, pledged to bring both sides to the negotiating table. Ukrainian forces launched the unprecedented Kursk invasion in early August, achieving initial tactical success and marking the first time Russia was invaded at a significant since World War II. In recent months, Ukraine has been on the defensive as Russia reportedly recaptured almost half of the lost territory and deployed reinforcements, including North Korean troops. The strategic impact of the Kursk incursion has been hotly debated. Critics have pointed out that despite its stated goal of drawing away Russian forces from their offensive in Donetsk Oblast, Moscow&apos;s advance in Ukraine&apos;s east has only picked up pace since the incursion began. In the interview, Zelensky called the deployment of North Korean soldiers in the region a &quot;tactical mistake.&quot; &quot;And that&apos;s why there are 12,000 (North Koreans) who came with weapons, and the North Korean soldiers also couldn&apos;t do anything. All this works against Russia and is a strong argument for us.&quot; The White House said on Dec. 27 that North Korean soldiers suffered over 1,000 casualties in Kursk Oblast over the past week alone as they carried out &quot;human wave&quot; assaults with little effect.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-on-kursk-incursion/	2025-01-02T23:50:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188503703.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure at least 13 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed two people and injured at least 13 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Jan. 3. Ukrainian forces downed 60 out of 93 drones, including Shahed-type ones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Another 26 drones were &quot;lost,&quot; it added. The wreckage of downed Russian drones killed a truck driver born in 1999 in Kyiv Oblast overnight, acting Governor Mykola Kalashnyk said. Debris also damaged a house near the town of Bila Tserkva, causing a fire and injuring two people, including a 16-year-old boy, according to State Emergency Service. One more woman suffered injuries from the attack near Fastiv in the region. One person was killed in the town of Chasiv Yar in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 39 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Ten people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Russian forces also carried out an air strike on a residential area in the city of Sumy on the morning of Jan. 3. No casualties have been reported so far. Search and rescue operations are ongoing.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-injure-over-past-day-4/	2025-01-02T23:03:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-03_07-22-13.jpg
We would violate Ukrainian legislation on behalf of Putin' — Zelensky again rejects elections under martial law	Ukraine will not hold elections under martial law even if Russia puts it forward as one of the pre-conditions for negotiations, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview on Ukrainian television released on Jan. 2. Ukraine was scheduled to hold a presidential election in March or April 2024, concluding Zelensky&apos;s first five-year term. The vote was postponed as the country&apos;s constitution does not permit elections under martial law, which was declared on Feb. 24, 2022, at the onset of Russia&apos;s all-out invasion. Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to use the delay to portray Zelensky as &quot;illegitimate,&quot; saying that the authority should pass to Parliament speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk, a claim rejected by Kyiv as a distortion of the constitution. In the interview, Zelensky reiterated that presidential and parliamentary elections are not possible under martial law and that the elected officials continue to legally perform their duties until the next vote. After Ukraine manages to end the hot stage of the war, maintains a strong army, and secures powerful security guarantees, martial law can be lifted, and the parliament can set a date for the elections, the president said. &quot;After martial law ends, there is no need to wait years for the elections,&quot; Zelensky added. When asked whether Ukraine is ready to compromise if Russia sets immediate elections as a condition for peace talks, Zelensky dismissed the idea. &quot;We would violate Ukrainian legislation on behalf of Putin, who has violated all our legislation, sovereignty, and territorial integrity,&quot; the president responded. There are growing expectations of possible peace talks in 2025 as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who will take office on Jan. 20, pledged to bring both sides to the negotiating table.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-again-rejects-elections-under-martial-law/	2025-01-02T22:53:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187689001.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 793,250 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 793,250 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 3. This number includes 1,080 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,677 tanks, 20,070 armored fighting vehicles, 32,770 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,555 artillery systems, 1,257 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,032 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 330 helicopters, 21,249 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-793-250-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-02T22:13:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188573525.jpg
Kerch Strait oil spill significantly smaller than initially thought, Russia claims	The amount of oil spilled in the Kerch Strait by two Russian oil tankers is &quot;significantly less than the initial estimate,&quot; Russia&apos;s Transport Ministry claimed on Jan. 2. Two Russian oil tankers,Volgoneft 212 and Volgoneft 239, suffered severe damage during a storm on Dec. 15. Both vessels were reportedly carrying a total of 9,200 tons of fuel, which began leaking into the Black Sea. Russian state news outlet RIA Novosti initially reported that some 3,700 tons of low-grade fuel oil have spilled into the Kerch Strait, forcing Russia to declare a federal state of emergency in response to the spill. Russian scientist Viktor Danilov-Danilyan said in a press conference on Dec. 25 that about 200,000 tons of soil along the Black Sea coast have been contaminated, while Greenpeace Ukraine warned on Dec. 16 that the destruction of the Russian oil tankers could cause &quot;significant&quot; environmental damage. On Jan. 2, Russia&apos;s Transport Ministry claimed that only about 2,400 metric tons of oil had spilled, citing a skewed account &quot;of one of the tanker captains.&quot; The Transport Ministry added that the M100-grade fuel oil spilled into the sea solidifies at a lower temperature, thus sinking to the surface instead of remaining at the surface. The Kyiv Independent cannot verify claims made by Russian officials. The Kerch Strait separates mainland Russia from Russian-occupied Crimea. In October, the Kyiv School of Economics Institute warned that Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of old and poorly insured tankers pose significant environmental risks, as these vessels increase the danger of oil spills. Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine has caused massive environmental damage, including the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka Dam and subsequent flooding, widespread forest fires, and the devastation of wide stretches of farm land. -	https://kyivindependent.com/kerch-strait-oil-spill-significantly-smaller-than-initially-thought-russia-claims/	2025-01-02T18:21:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1477538300.jpg
Trump can be decisive in ending war' —Zelensky on Ukraine's outlook for 2025	President Volodymyr Zelensky, joined alongside his wife First Lady Olena Zelenska, delivered a candid, wide-ranging interview on Ukrainian television released on Jan. 2, laying out his vision for Ukraine&apos;s prospects of a potential peace in 2025. &quot;How many days did 2024 have? 1,000?&quot; Zelensky joked before addressing questions about the potential end of the war in 2025. The interview comes just weeks ahead of the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 20, who has vowed to shift Ukraine&apos;s prospects after assuming office and negotiate a way out of the war. Over the course of the hour-long interview, Zelensky delved into a wide-range of topics &#x2014; both of domestic and international significance &#x2014; as Ukraine faces the daunting task of securing a lasting peace as the start of the fourth year of full-scale war. When asked about U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, Zelensky was clear about the impact he can make on the prospects of ending the war in 2025. &quot;He can be decisive in ending war... or, more realistically, he can help us stop (Russian President Vladimir) Putin. He can do this,&quot; Zelensky said, adding, &quot;I believe he truly wants to end this war.&quot; Trump&apos;s pledge to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of Russia&apos;s war and negotiate a quick peace deal has received mixed reaction in Kyiv. Ukrainian officials have urged the president-elect to maintain support and adopt a &quot;peace through strength&quot; approach in dealings with Russia as Trump has nominated some officials seen as more conservative and skeptical about providing military aid to Ukraine. &quot;I believe Putin is scared of Trump. That&apos;s why he&apos;s taking steps to get some of the Kremlin&apos;s voice somehow into the Trump administration,&quot; Zelensky said. Despite some more controversial appointments, Trump has also selected key figures seen in a positive light in Kyiv, including U.S. General Keith Kellogg as Ukraine peace envoy. &quot;Thus far, I have not had any negative interactions in our relations (with the Trump administration),&quot; Zelensky said in the interview. &quot;The most important aspect is that we build these relationships.&quot; Following the appointment of Kellogg, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said that Kellogg was &quot;not a new person for Ukraine.&quot; &quot;The Embassy of Ukraine in the U.S. has maintained close ties with him, in particular within the framework of expert diplomacy in recent years, and has developed and maintained a good dialogue with him during this time,&quot; Tykhyi added. Kellogg has echoed Trump&apos;s commitment to ending the war, saying in a December interview that he believes the war will be &quot;resolved in the next few months.&quot; Kellogg has agreed to visit Kyiv following Trump&apos;s inauguration. Since Trump&apos;s election victory in November, Kyiv has made concerted efforts to strengthen ties with the incoming administration, even meeting Trump amid the 2024 presidential election campaign. The history between the two leaders is fraught, stemming from Trump&#x2019;s 2019 impeachment trial, which revolved around allegations that Trump withheld military aid to pressure Zelensky into investigating Hunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden. Despite this, Trump recently remarked that he &quot;likes&quot; Zelensky and had a &quot;good relationship&quot; with him during his previous term. Zelensky previously said that the country must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means in 2025, adding that a war would &quot;end faster&quot; under a Trump administration. During the interview, Zelensky also touched on Ukraine&apos;s pressing need for robust security guarantees. &quot;Any security guarantees without the United States are weak security guarantees for Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;To be honest, Europeans are keeping their eyes out on the opinion of the president of the United States.&quot; The Ukrainian president weighed in on French President Emmanuel Macron&#x2019;s efforts to advocate for European soldiers as potential peacekeepers in Ukraine. While he welcomed ideas surrounding the initiative, Zelensky underscored the necessity of broader European participation. &quot;We wouldn&apos;t want (the peacekeeping initiative) to be just one, two countries, if it get to this initiative,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that any potential path forward to a permanent security guarantees must be through the country&apos;s NATO membership. &quot;I see that Trump has a positive impression of the idea,&quot; Zelensky said regarding potential European peacekeepers in Ukraine. Following a meeting with Zelensky and Macron in Paris in early December, Trump reportedly made clear he wants to see Europe take up leadership of monitoring a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. &quot;The hot phase of the war may end rather quickly if Trump is strong in his position, and I believe that his position should fall in line with those of European allies,&quot; Zelensky said when asked the possibility of the war ending following Trump&apos;s inauguration. Despite the possibility of upcoming peace negotiations, Zelensky stressed that Ukraine&apos;s priority remains accession into the NATO military alliance. Zelensky added that the presence of European troops along Ukraine&apos;s front line would not negate the country&apos;s NATO ambitions. Kyiv submitted its application to join NATO in September 2022, and in July 2024, the alliance affirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership&quot; &#x2014; although Ukraine has not received any definitive news about its future accession. Despite Ukraine&apos;s commitment to joining the alliance, in recent months, Ukraine has shifted its rhetoric suggesting that Ukraine&#x2019;s accession to NATO remains on the agenda but diplomatic efforts currently focus on obtaining strong security guarantees. &quot;In short, a just peace for us is the understanding that we are in the EU and when. The understanding that we strong security guarantees, with NATO as the best option,&quot; Zelensky concluded.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-interview/	2025-01-02T16:35:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188205516.jpg
US looking into restricting or banning drones made by 'foreign adversaries,' including China, Russia	The U.S. Commerce Department announced on Jan. 2 that it would explore how to secure the technology and supply chain of drones from foreign adversaries, including China and Russia. The department&apos;s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) said in a statement that it was seeking public consultation &quot;to inform the potential development of a rule to secure and safeguard the information and communication technology and services (ICTS) supply chain for drones.&quot; The agency added that the involvement of foreign adversaries in &quot;supply chains, including acute threats from China and Russia &#x2013; may offer our adversaries the ability to remotely access and manipulate these devices, exposing sensitive U.S. data.&quot; The U.S. and China &#x2014; which produces a majority of the world&apos;s drones &#x2014; have a frosty relationship, exacerbated by opposing views on foreign policy, including China&apos;s stance on Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and U.S. support for Taiwan. The U.S. blacklisted 37 Chinese companies due to security concerns on May 9. &quot;Securing the unmanned aircraft systems technology supply chain is critical to safeguarding our national security. This (advance notice of proposed rulemaking) is an essential step in protecting the United States from vulnerabilities posed by foreign entities,&quot; U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Jan. 2. If implemented, the proposed rule change may restrict or ban drones from countries the U.S. deems as foreign adversaries. In March 2024 the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill requiring TikTok&apos;s Chinese parent company, ByteDance to sell its stakes in the company within six months or lose access to U.S. markets. The U.S. is increasingly becoming more watchful of its own national security amid high-profile incidents such as foreign interference in U.S. elections. Ukraine previously announced a ban on the use of software and websites from Russia and other sanctioned countries on Aug. 16, following high-profile cyber attacks that threatened Ukraine&apos;s national security.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-commerce-department-looking-into-restricting-or-banning-chinese-drones/	2025-01-02T16:21:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-sb10066698qn-001.jpg
Transnistria faces industrial collapse after Russian gas suspension, senior official says	The cessation of Russian gas supplies via Ukraine has halted all industrial activity in Moldova&apos;s Russian-occupied Transnistria, Sergey Obolonik, the first deputy chairman of the Transnistrian administration, said on Jan. 2. Russia&#x2019;s state-owned energy giant Gazprom suspended gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1, citing unpaid debts by Moldovagaz. Moldovan officials, however, argue that these debts haven&#x2019;t been verified by an international audit. Although a deal allowing Russian gas to transit through Ukraine expired on the same day, Gazprom insists the suspension is due to Moldova&#x2019;s outstanding debt, not transit issues. The halt has left Transnistria without sufficient energy, resulting in widespread heating outages. Obolonik described the gas crisis as &quot;grave,&quot; with shortages cutting supply to nearly 75,000 households and leaving another 116,000 with reduced volumes. He warned that prolonged disruptions could cause irreversible damage to the region&#x2019;s industrial capacity. Moldova has offered to assist Transnistria in purchasing gas through European platforms. Vadim Cheban, head of Moldovagaz, announced that Chisinau is prepared to support Transnistrian authorities in securing energy resources on market terms to address the crisis. Moldova&#x2019;s state-owned energy company, Energocom, will import electricity from Romania and Ukraine to address a shortfall caused by Russia&#x2019;s gas supply halt. Starting in January, 62% of Moldova&#x2019;s electricity needs will be met by imports from Romania, while 30% will come from local thermal plants and renewable energy. Energocom plans to import surplus electricity from Ukraine&#x2019;s state nuclear operator, Energoatom, during off-peak hours. Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean criticized the Kremlin for using energy as a &quot;political weapon,&quot; a concern echoed across Europe as nations reduce dependency on Russian gas. Moldova, an EU candidate aiming for membership by 2030, has heightened security efforts following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russian troops have occupied Transnistria since the early 1990s, after Moscow&#x2019;s intervention under the pretext of protecting ethnic Russians. Pro-Western President Maia Sandu has accused Russia of attempting to destabilize her government, as Moldova faces growing regional security threats.	https://kyivindependent.com/transnistria-faces-industrial-collapse-after-russian-gas-suspension-senior-official-says/	2025-01-02T11:51:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1686318530.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Kyiv strikes Russian command post in Kursk Oblast, General Staff claims	Key developments on Jan. 2: The Ukrainian Armed Forces conducted a precision strike on a Russian army command post in Maryino, Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Jan. 2. &quot;These attacks are primarily carried out to weaken Russia&apos;s ability and willingness to carry out terrorist acts against Ukrainian civilians,&quot; the General Staff said, adding that &quot;all necessary measures&quot; were taken to minimize risks to civilians in the vicinity of the strike. It did not specify the type of weapon used in the attack. The strike targeted the 810th Russian Brigade, resulting in significant losses, according to Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&#x2019;s counter-disinformation center. Local Telegram channels earlier reported shelling in Ivanovskoye in the Rylsk district, with damage to a boarding school, post office, shopping center, residential buildings, and the house of culture. Windows were shattered, and walls were damaged by shrapnel, according to acting Kursk Oblast Governor Alexander Khinshtein. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The strike follows Ukraine&#x2019;s surprise incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, during which Ukrainian forces captured about 1,300 square kilometers of territory. While Kyiv has since lost control of half of the initially seized area, fighting in the region remains intense. Ukrainian officials view the occupied territory as a potential bargaining chip in future negotiations with Russia. Two Russian helicopters were downed in a recent strike by the Ukrainian-made Magura V5 naval strike drones, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) reported on its Telegram channel. HUR earlier reported on Dec. 31 that one of its units had downed an aerial target with the Ukrainian-made Magura drone equipped with SeeDragon missiles for the first time, destroying one Russian Mi-8 helicopter and damaging another helicopter. According to an updated statement by HUR published on Jan. 2, two helicopters were downed and one was damaged in the attack. Russian propaganda channels admitted the loss of two helicopters earlier. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify HUR&#x2019;s claims. The Magura drone has helped Ukraine push back against Russia&#x2019;s Black Sea Fleet by striking dozens of ships this year. They have been in operation since the summer of 2023. The drone is able to cover a distance of more than 800 kilometers (500 miles), reach a speed of 80 km/h (50 mph), and is capable of carrying a 250-kilogram warhead. Each one is 5.5 meters long and costs approximately Hr 10 million ($240,000). In June, HUR announced that the drones had been modified to operate anti-aircraft missiles, presenting a serious threat to the Russian Air Force over the Black Sea. Ukraine is to carry out a comprehensive review of the Ground Forces command, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Jan. 2, to be conducted by the Defense Ministry&#x2019;s Main Inspectorate. &quot;Victory requires a deep analysis of experience, and an honest understanding of mistakes,&quot; Umerov said. The review aims to evaluate management structures, processes, and compliance with legislation to support reforms and enhance battlefield effectiveness. The announcement comes after newly appointed Ground Forces Commander General Mykhailo Drapatyi unveiled plans on Dec. 12 for fundamental reforms to strengthen the branch. Umerov said the analysis would provide Drapatyi with a full picture of the state of affairs in the Ground Forces. &quot;Events in the Ground Forces directly affect the situation on the front,&quot; Umerov said, underscoring the strategic importance of the reforms. Based on the findings, the Defense Ministry plans to introduce reforms in personnel policies, optimize management processes, and improve combat capabilities with new training approaches. Drapatyi&#x2019;s proposed changes include revamping the recruitment system, which will have zero tolerance for corruption, enhanced front-line training, and integration of advanced technology into operations. The reforms come amid reported personnel shortages, with slow mobilization efforts leaving some front-line units undermanned. Drapatyi has highlighted the need to reform training curricula and prioritize social support for service members to prepare for modern warfare effectively. Russian attacks against Ukraine wounded six and killed four people over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 2. Two civilians were killed and six were injured in Kherson Oblast following Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure, high-rise buildings, and houses in over 38 of the oblast&#x2019;s settlements, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on his Telegram channel. A Russian attack overnight killed a civilian in the town of Stepnohirsk in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported on his Telegram channel on Jan. 2. One person was killed in the city of Mirnohrad in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on his Telegram channel. Russia launched 72 drones, including Iranian-designed Shahed ones, against Ukraine overnight on Jan. 2, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported on its Telegram channel. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 47 drones over 12 oblasts, and forced an additional 24 to veer off course without casualties, the Air Force said. One drone was in the air at the time of the publication of the Air Force&#x2019;s report. Civilian infrastructure, buildings and a car were damaged as a result of Russian attacks in Kharkiv Oblast, but there were no civilian injuries, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported on his Telegram channel.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-kyiv-strikes-russian-command-post-in-kursk-oblast-general-staff-claims/	2025-01-02T11:06:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1258245894.jpg
Slovakia may cut aid to Ukrainian refugees over Russian gas transit halt, PM Fico says	Slovakia could reduce aid for Ukrainian refugees in response to Ukraine&#x2019;s decision to terminate Russian gas transit through its territory, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said on Jan. 2 While Fico said that Slovak households would not face energy shortages, he said Slovakia stands to lose &#x20AC;500 million ($513 million) annually in transit revenue. Ukraine terminated Russian natural gas transit through its territory on Jan. 1. Kyiv repeatedly warned it would not renew the transit agreement to avoid financing Russia&#x2019;s war. Fico criticized Ukraine&apos;s stance, saying Ukraine &quot;dared to complain about Bratislava&apos;s consideration of retaliatory measures.&quot; &quot;On behalf of Smer (the ruling party), I announce that we are ready to negotiate and agree in a coalition to cut off electricity supplies and significantly reduce support for Ukrainian citizens staying in the territory of the Slovak Republic,&quot; he added. The announcement follows Fico&#x2019;s earlier threats to cut off electricity exports to Ukraine amid escalating blackouts caused by Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure. He also confirmed that Slovak, Ukrainian, and European Commission representatives will meet on Jan. 7 in Brussels to discuss the shutdown, reportedly at Kyiv&#x2019;s request. Despite EU efforts to reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels, Slovakia remains reliant on Russian gas under a long-term contract with Russia&apos;s state-owned energy giant Gazprom. Switching to alternative supply routes could cost Slovakia an additional &#x20AC;220 million ($229 million) in transit fees.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovakia-may-cut-aid-to-ukrainian-refugees-over-gas-transit-halt-pm-fico-says/	2025-01-02T10:22:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2152712934.jpg
Finland requests seizure of Russian 'shadow fleet' tanker over suspected cable sabotage	Finland&apos;s national grid operator Fingrid has asked a court to seize the Eagle S oil tanker in connection with the damage to the Estlink 2 undersea electricity cable, Reuters reported on Jan. 2. The cable, a 170-kilometer (106-mile) critical infrastructure component linking Finland and Estonia, was reported to have been seriously damaged on Dec. 25, prompting an investigation into possible sabotage. Finnish authorities suspect the damage was caused by the Eagle S oil tanker, allegedly part of Moscow&#x2019;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet&quot; used to circumvent sanctions. Fingrid has filed a claim with the Helsinki District Court to seize the tanker as part of securing financial reparations. &quot;Further investigations at the damage site are expected to provide more information about the extent of the damages and enable more detailed planning and scheduling of the repair,&quot; Fingrid said, adding that repairs are expected to be completed by August. NATO is increasing its military presence in the Baltic Sea to bolster situational awareness and deter potential threats. Allies are also exploring measures to protect critical undersea infrastructure, supported by NATO&apos;s Maritime Centre for Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure, established in May. The damaged cable is one of several recent incidents in the Baltic Sea under investigation as possible acts of sabotage.	https://kyivindependent.com/finland-requests-seizure-of-russian-shadow-fleet-tanker-over-suspected-cable-sabotage/	2025-01-02T10:05:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167101990.jpg

Russia loses key leverage over Europe after Ukraine halts gas transit, FM Sybiha says	Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Jan. 2 that halting the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine has stripped the Kremlin of one of its remaining tools to pressure European nations. Ukraine terminated Russian natural gas transit through its territory on Jan. 1. Kyiv repeatedly warned it would not renew the transit agreement to avoid financing Russia&#x2019;s war. &quot;Ukraine has cut off more than just Russian gas transit. We have cut off some of Putin&#x2019;s last remaining leverage over Europe, and his use of energy as a weapon,&quot; Sybiha posted on X. He added that Europe and the world would be safer without Russian energy dependencies. The decision comes amid a significant reduction in European reliance on Russian gas following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Slovakia and Hungary remain dependent on Russian supplies. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico have opposed Ukraine&apos;s decision. The halt also caused a major gas outage in Moldova&apos;s Russian-occupied Transnistria region, which relied on transit through Ukraine, according to its gas supplier Tiraspoltransgaz-Pridnestrovie. The move reflects Ukraine&#x2019;s broader strategy to weaken Russia&#x2019;s economic influence and reduce its ability to use energy as a weapon against Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/halting-russian-gas-transit-removes-kremlins-leverage-over-europe-fm-sybiha-says/	2025-01-02T08:37:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187504899.jpg
Citing Orban’s 'corruption,' Hungarian opposition leader calls for early elections in video address	Hungarian opposition leader Peter Magyar called for early elections in a New Year&#x2019;s video address on Jan. 1, citing Prime Minister Viktor Orban&#x2019;s declining popularity and allegations of corruption. Orban has faced mounting criticism domestically and internationally for his pro-Moscow stance, including opposition to EU sanctions on Russia and military aid for Ukraine. &quot;Let there be a new election to return the right of deciding their fate to the people,&quot; Magyar said, marking his first public demand for elections before the scheduled 2026 vote. He accused Orban of turning Hungary into &quot;the EU&apos;s poorest, most corrupt nation.&quot; &quot;You&apos;ve made Hungary the EU&apos;s poorest, most corrupt nation.&quot; Opposition leader P&#xE9;ter Magyar&#x2019;s New Year&apos;s video message slamming Viktor Orb&#xE1;n&apos;s corruption and demanding early elections has gone viral, nearing 2M views on Hungarian social media.Excerpt with English captions.&#x1F447; pic.twitter.com/MvzEQo1k8z Magyar has taken a nuanced stance to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, echoing his government&#x2019;s opposition to sending Hungarian troops or weapons to Ukraine, but supporting Kyiv&#x2019;s right to self-defense. During a July 2023 visit to Kyiv, Magyar delivered humanitarian aid, and expressed solidarity with Ukraine after a Russian attack. Adding to Orban&#x2019;s challenges, Hungary lost &#x20AC;1.04 billion ($1.08 billion) in EU funding after failing to implement reforms to meet rule-of-law standards, the European Commission confirmed on Dec. 31. This marked the EU&apos;s first action of this kind against a member state. The reforms aimed to address issues in political financing, media independence, and conflict-of-interest laws but were not completed by the end-of-2024 deadline. Orban&#x2019;s 18 years in power have drawn both praise and criticism. While hailed by supporters as a champion of Hungarian conservatism, his tenure has been marred by allegations of authoritarianism, corruption, and democratic backsliding. Magyar&#x2019;s call for early elections underscores growing dissatisfaction with Orban&#x2019;s leadership as Hungary grapples with strained EU relations and domestic unrest.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungarian-opposition-leader-calls-for-early-elections-citing-orbans-corruption-and-declining-popularity/	2025-01-02T08:03:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156270759.jpg

Polish farmers to protest Ukrainian imports, EU policies, in Warsaw on Jan. 3	Polish farmers are planning a large protest in Warsaw to voice opposition to agricultural imports from Ukraine, and EU agricultural policies, Farmer.pl reported on Jan. 2. The protest, which will take place on Jan. 3, follows a series of demonstrations by Polish farmers against Ukrainian agricultural imports since the start of the full-scale war. Farmers argue that cheaper Ukrainian agricultural imports, allowed under the EU&apos;s free trade regime with Ukraine, have disrupted Poland&#x2019;s domestic market and hurt local producers. Organized by the Union of Agricultural Organizations, the protest will take place in front of the European Commission&#x2019;s office before moving to the National Theater. Tomasz Obszanski, leader of the Solidarnosc Individual Farmers&apos; Union, accused the European Commission, led by Ursula von der Leyen, of imposing policies that he claims threaten the survival of Polish farms. As well as agricultural imports from Ukraine, the farmers say they are trying to highlight several other issues, including the EU&apos;s proposed free trade agreement with Mercosur, an economic union in South America, the EU&#x2019;s Green Deal policies, and the perceived decline of Poland&#x2019;s economy due to EU policies. Most recently, on Nov. 23, farmers staged a blockade at the Shehyni border crossing with Ukraine, which lasted just over a day and restricted truck traffic. Warsaw has already implemented bans on certain Ukrainian products, such as grain, citing negative impacts on Polish agriculture. The Polish government has expressed support for farmers&#x2019; concerns, highlighting challenges posed by the EU&#x2019;s trade policies while also seeking to maintain solidarity with Ukraine during the ongoing war.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-farmers-to-protest-ukrainian-imports-eu-policies-in-warsaw-on-jan-3/	2025-01-02T06:48:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2018750299.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 7	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 7 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Dec. 23-Dec. 31, 2024. This newsletter was until recently titled &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief.&quot; The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Ukraine launches competition for head of Bureau of Economic Security The race for the new head of Ukraine&#x2019;s Bureau of Economic Security is officially on. A draft law ensures transparent procedures of the competition and the decisive vote of independent international experts in the commission. The deadline for applications is Jan. 24, 2025. An International Monetary Fund-related deadline to appoint the new bureau head is the end of February. Ukrainian government registers two draft laws to meet IMF commitments On Dec. 30, Ukraine&#x2019;s Cabinet of Ministers submitted two critical bills to Parliament, aiming to fulfill structural benchmarks outlined in the IMF program. The first, draft law #12368, proposes the establishment of a Higher Administrative Court to replace the dissolved Kyiv District Administrative Court (OASK). The second, draft law #12367, seeks to repeal the controversial &quot;Lozovyi amendments.&quot; The texts of these bills have not yet been published on Parliament&#x2019;s website. While the deadline for their adoption under the IMF Memorandum is Dec. 31, it is widely expected that Ukrainian authorities will push for their adoption before the next IMF board meeting in February. Tax and customs exemptions extended for defense-related imports President Volodymyr Zelenksy has signed Laws #12266 and #12267, amending the Tax and Customs Codes to extend key exemptions into 2025. These include benefits for importing drones, components, and materials used in the production of ammunition and shells. Ukraine advances OECD membership agenda with new anti-corruption laws Zelensky has signed critical legislation to align Ukraine with OECD standards. Law #10319 introduces tax measures to combat bribery of foreign officials in international business, while Law #11443 adjusts corporate liability for corruption offenses to meet international benchmarks. These moves mark a significant stride in Ukraine&#x2019;s journey toward OECD membership. Shake-up in Ukraine&#x2019;s economic institutions On the last day of the year the Cabinet of Ministers made two personnel changes in Ukraine&#x2019;s economic oversight bodies. Ruslan Kravchenko, former governor of Kyiv region, was appointed as a new head of the State Tax Service, while Filip Pronin, ex-governor of Poltava region, became the head of the State Financial Monitoring Service. Both were appointed without competition selection which is possible according to martial law. Both are said to have close ties to Andriy Yermak, head of the Presidential Office.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-7/	2025-01-02T05:06:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167201231.jpg

Leader of German social-democrats supports more phone calls between Scholz and Putin	More phone calls should take place between German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the leader of Germany&#x2019;s social-democratic party (SPD) Saskia Esken told German television news channel N-Tv on Jan. 2. &#x201C;These conversations must be held again and again in order to find out what can be done to finally put an end to the killing and the dying,&#x201D; she said. Social-democrat Chancellor Scholz held a call with Putin mid-November in 2024, drawing criticism from Western allies. Later, Scholz said that he was ready to call Putin again. President Volodymyr Zelensky called the chancellor&apos;s conversation with the Russian leader the opening of a &#x201C;Pandora&#x2019;s box.&#x201D; During that conversation in November 2024, Scholz condemned Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, calling on Putin to end the invasion and withdraw Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. He also urged Russia to negotiate with Ukraine to achieve a &#x201C;just and lasting peace.&#x201D; Esken does not currently support the idea of a public meeting between Putin and Scholz. &#x201C;As long as the attitudes remain unchanged, it is certainly sufficient to talk on the phone,&#x201D; she said. Germany is heading toward snap elections on Feb. 23, 2025, with right-wing conservative CDU/CSU leading the polls after Scholz fired FDP&apos;s Finance Minister Christian Lindner, leading to the coalition&apos;s collapse.	https://kyivindependent.com/leader-of-german-social-democrats-urges-more-phone-calls-between-scholz-and-putin/	2025-01-02T04:06:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1858823480.jpg
‘Ukraine today is in the strongest position ever,’ ex-foreign minister Kuleba says	As Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine inches toward the three-year mark, all eyes are on a potential peace agreement to end the war. If the parameters of any peace deal are likely to remain obscured for months to come, Ukraine&#x2019;s ex-Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba says one thing is clear &#x2014; Russia is not going to ask for peace. &#x201C;Russia wants to be begged (to engage in the peace talks),&#x201D; Kuleba told the Kyiv Independent in an interview late last year. Kuleba worked as a minister for over four years through most of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion until his resignation in September during the biggest wartime government reshuffle. He is one of the most recognized Ukrainian politicians abroad, known for his impassioned appeals to partners to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Amid news of the latest Russian advances on the front and global talks on how U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will seek to negotiate an end to the war, the Kyiv Independent sat down with Kuleba in Kyiv to discuss a potential peace agreement and a path forward for Ukraine. Editor&#x2019;s note: This is a transcript of the video interview with the former foreign minister. It has been edited for clarity. The Kyiv Independent: What do you expect from the next few months? Dmytro Kuleba: I don&apos;t think any negotiations will begin before the inauguration of President Trump. We will spend the upcoming months in a whirlpool of news and comments and leaks coming from all corners about the peace talks, but even now, if you put the noise aside and look at the essence of what key stakeholders are saying, they just keep repeating the same speaking point in different ways. Everyone says, &#x201C;We want peace.&#x201D; Russia has a different stance on this. Russia wants to be begged &#x2014; this is its strategy. It doesn&#x2019;t want to make the first move, it wants others to approach it and beg it to do something. The Kyiv Independent: What do you say to people who want to build friendly ties with Russia again, especially in Europe? Dmytro Kuleba: It&apos;s hard to find someone who would openly tell you that they want to build good relations with Russia today, but there are people with the underlying argument that the day will come and there will be good Russia. They don&apos;t want to analyze the past in an unbiased way and admit that all attempts to democratize Russia failed. Liberal Russia exists only as a dystopia. It&apos;s a classic 19th-century empire. It&apos;s a country that wants to be seen and sees itself in terms of the classic 19th-century empire. We saw it with Germany, the Ottoman Empire, Japan, and Yugoslavia. And there is only one way to deprive a country of its aggressive instincts. And that is to take it through loss, through defeat. This is the only viable way of ensuring that the war will not repeat and that Russia will not pose a threat to anyone, not only to Ukraine but also to other countries. But the people you are referring to think differently. They come up with traditional foreign policy concepts and game-playing in politics, saying that there should not be a zero-sum outcome for everyone. &#x201C;Russia should get something,&#x201D; (they believe). And then we end up in this messy intellectual and political setting where partners want Ukraine to win, but they don&apos;t want Russia to lose. The Kyiv Independent: What would Ukraine winning without Russia losing look like? Dmytro Kuleba: It just doesn&apos;t work this way. If you make Ukraine win, but Russia doesn&apos;t lose, what you get is revanchism. Russia will immediately undertake another attempt to reach all the goals of what they call &#x201C;the special military operation.&#x201D; Russian guard soldiers carrying the Russian national flag and a red Soviet flag during the march on Red Square in Moscow, Russia on May 9, 2024. (Natalia Kolesnikova / AFP via Getty Images)It will be just a pause before the next war between Russia and Ukraine starts. If you have something in the middle, where diplomats like to say that a good agreement is when either everyone walks out from the negotiating room happy or everyone walks out of the room unhappy, then it was a good deal. But if both Russia and Ukraine walk out of the negotiating room unhappy, this is again an invitation to revanchism for both sides. Ukraine&apos;s potential for revanchist policies toward Russia from a mid-term perspective should not be underestimated and written off. The Kyiv Independent: Could you elaborate on potential revanchist policies in Ukraine towards Russia? Dmytro Kuleba: The next generation of Ukrainian politicians will be focused entirely on the recovery of Ukraine after the war. But the generation after them will come to power on the slogans of revanche towards Russia. &#x201C;Retake territories, make Russia finally pay.&#x201D; The moment we are up from our knees economically, you will see these arguments being played out in domestic politics. The Kyiv Independent: There was an idea that sanctions were going to make it too costly for Russia to continue the war and it would stop at some point. We&apos;re not seeing it happening now. Is that because sanctions don&apos;t work? What can we do to make them work? Dmytro Kuleba: Sanctions, political isolation, support of providing Ukraine with weapons and financial assistance, resolve to deliver a message to Russia that it&#x2019;s not going to get what it&apos;s looking for &#x2014; when all these pieces come together, strengthening Ukraine and shattering Russia from the inside, then we will have victory. &#x201C;Sanctions don&apos;t work&#x201D; is a Russian narrative. Sanctions do work. But they serve their function on two conditions: first when you keep introducing new sanctions, stepping up pressure on the sanctioned country. And second, when you continuously and regularly close the loopholes that are used for the circumvention of sanctions. These two things have to work hand in hand. Unfortunately, we see desynchronization. People read headlines in the news like &#x201C;The European Union approved a new set of sanctions.&#x201D; People feel relieved that something is happening. But if you look deeper into the list of what was adopted, this is not really damaging stuff for them. Russia will keep selling its oil. The key to the Russian economy is, of course, revenues from oil. This is fundamental. And it would be a huge help if Russia could be stripped of its oil revenues. But it&#x2019;s not the only element that can help Ukraine win. The Kyiv Independent: Does it mean that the countries talking about stopping Russia from getting revenues from oil just can&apos;t keep up with the methods that it finds to go around the sanctions, or are they not very resolute in employing the sanctions that will actually make a difference? Dmytro Kuleba: I think so far, oil-related measures were half-measures. They couldn&#x2019;t deprive Russia of its access to oil revenues. And the reason for that is what one could call global energy stability and the balance of power among oil exporters and regulators.

(Andrey Rudakov/ Bloomberg via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: Western partners believe that if they give Ukraine a lot of weapons, they will cross Russian &#x201C;red lines,&#x201D; and Russia will do something terrible. This is why they are stalling on providing Ukraine with enough military aid. Is this a real thing, Russian red lines? Dmytro Kuleba: Every conversation we had with our partners on weapons started with a &#x201C;no.&#x201D; &#x201C;It&apos;s an escalation. It&apos;s not what you need. It&apos;s too complicated. It&apos;s going to take too much time.&#x201D; We turned every &#x201C;no&#x201D; into &#x201C;yes&#x201D; and unlocked these options &#x2014; tanks, Patriots, howitzers, fighting jets. But we still hear the argument of non-escalation. Non-escalation is a very politicized term. When you have a country with nuclear power, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, which attacks its neighbor with a clear goal of destroying it to the ground &#x2014; this is called escalation. But everything the country that defends itself does to exercise its right to self-defense cannot be considered as escalation per se. This country is fighting for its life and survival. So when anyone says that Ukraine cannot do this or that, because it will be an escalation, they basically invite Russia to finish Ukraine off. All the nice words &#x2014; calls for peace, not feeding to the war, not escalating &#x2014; when it applies to helping Ukraine, this is an invitation for Russia to continue destroying Ukraine. Second, the escalation argument is flawed for another simple reason: We see that Russia keeps escalating at any cost. Russia brought North Korean troops to the front line because it lacked its own resources, not in response to Ukraine&#x2019;s actions or to the actions of its partners. Russia is destroying our energy system and our civilian infrastructure not because Ukraine is escalating, but because Russia is committed to achieving its goals. So it&apos;s hypocritical for our key partners to think of helping Ukraine in terms of avoiding escalation. The Kyiv Independent: Why should Trump support Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO? Dmytro Kuleba: Because it&apos;s the only way to prevent the next war. From a short-term perspective, you can reach a ceasefire without Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO. But a ceasefire is not the end of the war. Once you bargain membership in NATO for a ceasefire, you lose the opportunity to end the war. NATO is the only way to end the war conclusively and prevent future wars for two reasons. First, whatever we know of Putin, he will attack NATO only if he defeats Ukraine. If Ukraine comes out of this fight as a winning power and joins NATO, the combined military force of the alliance against Russia will be invincible. Second, in the prospect of maybe 10 years or so, I anticipate the emergence of revenge-driven political forces in Ukraine. It may sound counterintuitive, but the only way to prevent Ukraine from waging a war on Russia will be to have it in NATO, to make it bound by legal obligations of not exposing its allies to the risk of war with Russia. The Kyiv Independent: Does it mean that some Ukrainian territories stay occupied as a result of the deal to end the war? Dmytro Kuleba: No one can tell you now what the parameters of the deal will be. History has many cases when both territories had been occupied for decades and then liberated by their motherland power, like Alsace in France. There are other cases as well. One of the most popular references in Washington these days is the Korean example. Those who lean more towards Ukraine prefer to bring up the West and East Germany example. So there are plenty of cases in the world that you can learn from when it comes to territorial control. If a nation remains resolved and committed to the goal of restoring its territorial integrity, it doesn&apos;t matter how many years it will take. It&#x2019;s also a possibility that a nation learns over time how to live without these territories. And we don&apos;t know in which direction Ukrainian society will follow. The Kyiv Independent: Is Ukrainian society divided on how it sees victory in war? Dmytro Kuleba: Quite to the contrary, it&apos;s united. It set the bar very high. They want the victory that will consist of reaching the borders of 1991. But we are not having any conversation in our society on what other ways of winning are. Is temporary compromise acceptable at all? Or we are going to fight for every square meter of our land, whatever it takes? No one is talking about what could be temporary solutions on the way to the ultimate goal. Society is kind of telling the government, &#x201C;Now you are in charge of it, you show us what you achieved, and then we will decide whether to punish you or to praise you.&#x201D; The Kyiv Independent: What do you think should be the ultimate goal for Ukrainian society? Dmytro Kuleba: If we ever accept in our heads and hearts, in our minds and hearts, the idea that we abandon these lands, the currently occupied territories, this will be the beginning of the end of Ukrainian statehood. Because if you draw a line here, Russia will immediately point out: then why don&apos;t we draw it 100 kilometers further? Even today Russia claims that they want full territories of Kharkiv, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts. Now imagine you even engage in a conversation with them about where a temporary line could be drawn. For our partners it&apos;s an easy exercise, this is how history works. There is always a shining bright general coming from the West who comes to the land of war, takes the map, draws a red line and says, &#x201C;Be it so.&#x201D; &quot;The Wall of Remembrance of the Fallen for Ukraine,&quot; a memorial for Ukrainian soldiers, in downtown Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 23, 2024.

(Roman Pilipey / AFP via Getty Images)Our own land was divided this way after World War I and we clearly remember it. So it&apos;s easy for them to draw these lines, but for us as a nation, this is a swim-or-sink moment. But it doesn&apos;t mean that there can be temporary solutions on the way to restoring territorial integrity. As I said, what we have to ensure is that the idea of recovering these territories should be part of our national identity and national idea. The Kyiv Independent: But on the way there, can Ukraine find itself in a situation where it&apos;s decided for us what the temporary solution is to end the war? Dmytro Kuleba: I don&apos;t think so. I hold the position that no one can send Ukraine down the drain except the Ukrainians themselves. No decision can be imposed on Ukraine if we do not agree that it is imposed on us. When we look at Ukraine from the perspective of today&apos;s headlines in the news and social media, we seem weak, bleeding and exhausted. But when we zoom out, we inevitably come to a conclusion that today Ukraine is in the strongest position ever in its history. For the first time in hundreds of years, we have the state, the army, and the leadership. With all discussions taking place in the media and on the streets, we have national unity and clear national and political identities. For the first time, we are united in our attitude towards Russia. And finally, we have partners. We can complain a hundred times about what they&apos;ve done wrong, but they&apos;ve done a lot for us. And this is the first time in history that we have partners who actually stand by us despite all of their shortcomings. So in this generation, we have no right to lose this struggle, because we are today in the strongest position possible compared to all the preceding generations of Ukrainians who had fought and lost, unfortunately. We should not repeat their mistakes. And we have all the conditions for that. We don&#x2019;t have the right not to succeed.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-today-is-in-the-strongest-position-ever-ex-foreign-minister-kuleba-says/	2025-01-02T03:20:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1934971638.jpg
Ukraine’s electricity imports increased more than fivefold in 2024	Ukraine&#x2019;s electricity import increased more than fivefold in 2024 to 4.4 million megawatt-hours (MWh), ExPro consulting company&#x2019;s electricity monitoring data showed on Jan. 2. Russia has been carrying out massive campaigns of aerial attacks against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure since late 2022. The damages have caused serious energy deficits and necessitated the introduction of rolling blackouts across the country, sometimes lasting 20 hours. Russia also occupies Ukraine&apos;s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. The peak of imports this year occurred in June, when Ukraine received more than 850,000 MWh. Over the last year, Hungary accounted for 39% of the imports, followed by Slovakia with 23% and Romania at 18%, and Poland &#x2013; 14%, data showed. Ukraine became a net importer of electricity, exporting only 366,000 MWh in 2024. Russia also targeted substations vital for the operation of the three remaining Ukraine-run nuclear power plants: Rivne, Khmelnytskyi, and South Ukraine, intensifying the strain on the country&#x2019;s nuclear power plants, which supply two-thirds of its electricity. Experts warn that disrupting power to these facilities could lead to severe safety risks. The International Monetary Fund estimated the damage to Ukraine&#x2019;s power grid as a result of Russian attacks to cumulate as high as $56.5 billion by mid-2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-electricity-imports-increased-more-than-fivefold-in-2024/	2025-01-02T02:31:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1247620233.jpg
European gas prices rise after Russian gas transit through Ukraine halts	European gas prices rose by 4.3% to almost 51 euros on the first trading day after Ukraine stopped transiting Russia&#x2019;s natural gas to central-Europe, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 2. Ukraine terminated Russian natural gas transit through its territory on Jan. 1, having repeatedly warned it would not extend the agreement when it expired at the end of 2024 because it did not want to finance Russia&apos;s war. The rise in gas prices to 51 euros per megawatt-hour is the highest since October 2023, and comes ahead of freezing temperatures forecast across much of Europe. Experts told Bloomberg that the halt in supply will be remedied by tapping stored reserves this winter, but higher demand is expected for natural gas to refill inventories over the course of 2025. Liquified natural gas (LNG) can only partially replace Russian natural gas flows due to the lack of infrastructure for its transport and its higher price. Stopping Russian gas transit through Ukraine is &quot;one of Moscow&apos;s biggest defeats,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 1 on his Telegram channel. &quot;When Putin was handed power in Russia over 25 years ago, the annual gas pumping through Ukraine to Europe stood at over 130 billion cubic meters. Today, the transit of Russian gas is 0. This is one of Moscow&apos;s biggest defeats,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Turning energy into a weapon and cynical energy blackmail of partners is what deprived Russia of its most attractive and geographically accessible market.&quot; According to Zelensky, most European countries &quot;have adapted&quot; to the termination of Russian gas transit. Zelensky added that the allies&apos; common task now is to support Moldova, dependent on Russian supplies, in its energy transformation. Zelensky said he believes that U.S. gas supplies and other partners will make energy market prices more favorable.	https://kyivindependent.com/european-gas-prices-rise-after-russian-gas-transit-through-ukraine-halts/	2025-01-02T02:07:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1247343791.jpg

Ukraine's Navy says it destroyed over 37,000 Russian drones in 2024	Ukrainian naval units destroyed over 37,000 Russian drones in the year 2024, the Navy reported on Jan. 1. This includes Russian strike drones, operational and tactical unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), first-person-view (FPV) drones, strike UAVs, and Shahed-type attack drones, the Navy said in a Facebook post. Ukrainian naval forces also destroyed five Russian ships and 458 watercraft. Russia&apos;s UAV losses included 35,670 destroyed FPV drones and 1,140 strike drones, the Navy said. Ukrainian units also eliminated 192 operational and tactical drones and another 164 Shahed-136/131 drones. Russian drone attacks across Ukraine surged to record levels in the last months of 2024, with Moscow aiming to ramp up UAV production in the new year. Drone strikes have targeted Ukrainian residential neighborhoods and critical energy infrastructure. Ukrainian forces in turn have targeted Russian military facilites and equipment, both within Russia and in Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine. A Ukrainian-made Magura V5 naval strike drone on Dec. 31 destroyed a Russian Mi-8 helicopter for the first time. According to Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, Russian forces suffered high losses in 2024. Around 427,000 Russian soldiers were killed or wounded last year, he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-navy-says-it-destroyed-over-37-000-russian-drones-in-2024/	2025-01-01T18:04:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1635611552.jpg
Prominent scientists among victims of New Year's Day drone attack in Kyiv	The two victims killed in Russia&apos;s Jan. 1 drone strike on Kyiv were a married couple who both worked as scientists, Education and Science Minister Oksen Lisovyi announced. Prominent neurobiologist Ihor Zyma and doctor of biological sciences Olesia Sokur were killed in the attack, Lisovyi said on Facebook. Zyma and Sokur were married. &quot;The family devoted almost their entire lives to science,&quot; Lisovyi said. Zyma was a senior researcher and associate professor at the Institute for Biology and Medicine at the Taras Shevchenko National University in Kyiv. Sokur also worked at the Institute as a deputy director of scientific work and a member of the Academic Council. &quot;My sincere condolences to the relatives and friends of the deceased, as well as to all who suffered from today&apos;s morning terror,&quot; Lisovyi said. Russia launched a drone attack on Kyiv on the morning of Jan. 1, killing two people and injuring six others, including two pregnant women. The attack also damaged a building of the National Bank of Ukraine. Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion has taken a severe toll on Ukraine&apos;s scientific community. According to a study published by the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) on Dec. 11, 23.5 percent of scientists still living in Ukraine have lost access to critical input for their research, and 20.8 percent cannot physically access their institution. Around 18% of Ukraine&apos;s scientists have fled the country amid Russia&apos;s ongoing war.	https://kyivindependent.com/prominent-scientists-among-victims-of-new-years-day-drone-attack-in-kyiv/	2025-01-01T15:04:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/drone-strike.jpeg
Putin orders Russian government, top bank to cooperate with China on AI tech	Russian President Vladimir Putin has directed the Russian government and the state-owned bank Sberbank to develop artificial intelligence (AI) technology partnerships with China, according to instructions published on the Kremlin web portal on Jan. 1. Moscow&apos;s alliance with Beijing has helped Russia gain access to technology and equipment that have been blocked by Western sanctions due to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Putin told the government and Sberbank to &quot;ensure further cooperation with the People&apos;s Republic of China in technological research and development in the field of artificial intelligence.&quot; Sberbank has been tasked with leading Russia&apos;s AI development effort. International sanctions have limited Russia&apos;s ability to develop its AI industry. Major producers of microchips no longer ship to Russia due to restrictions, though the country still obtains products via third-party sellers in other countries. Graphics processing units (GPUs), microchips essential for AI development, have been difficult for Russia to replace, Sberbank CEO German Gref said in 2023. Putin said on Dec. 11 that he wanted to develop a new AI Alliance Network with members of BRICS and other interested countries. Sberbank claimed that AI associations from Brazil, China, India, and South Africa had already joined the network. BRICS is a bloc of emerging economies often portrayed as a counterweight to the Western-led world. China has deepened its ties with Russia since the start of the Kremlin&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, although Beijing has denied accusations of supporting Russia&apos;s military efforts. Chinese President Xi Jinping exchanged New Year greetings with Putin on Dec. 31, saying &quot;the political mutual trust and strategic coordination between the two sides have continuously marched to a higher level under the strategic guidance of the two leaders.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-orders-russian-government-top-bank-to-cooperate-with-china-on-ai-tech/	2025-01-01T14:12:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187508552.jpg
Zelensky offers condolences after deadly New Orleans truck attack	President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed his condolences to the families of the victims of a deadly vehicle attack in the U.S. city of New Orleans on New Year&apos;s Day. A truck driver in New Orleans intentionally rammed into a crowd on Jan. 1, killing at least 10 people and injuring 30. U.S. authorities are investigating the incident as a possible terrorist attack. &quot;Horrified by the attack in New Orleans, U.S., which has claimed innocent lives and left many injured,&quot; Zelensky wrote in a post on X. &quot;We trust that those responsible for this terrible act will be brought to justice. Violence, terrorism, and any threats to human life have no place in our world and must not be tolerated.&quot; The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said it had identified a suspect, a 42-year-old military veteran from Texas. The man was killed in a firefight with law enforcement officers. The FBI said they do not believe the driver was solely responsible for the attack. &quot;Our deepest condolences to the families of the victims, and we wish a swift recovery to all those injured,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Ukraine stands with the American people and denounces violence.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s comments came after Ukraine withstood its own barrage of New Year attacks.

Hungary loses out on about $1 billion in EU aid	Hungary will not receive 1.04 billion euros ($1.08 billion) in aid from the European Union due to violations of the rule of law, the German news agency DPA reported on Dec. 31, citing a European Commission spokesperson. The aid package was conditional on Hungary implementing reforms to bring the country into compliance with EU standards by the end of 2024. These included changes to laws on preventing conflicts of interest and fighting corruption. Budapest failed to meet the requirements, and thus lost funding, according to the European Commission. This was the EU&apos;s first such action against a bloc member. In 2022, the EU initiated a &quot;conditionality&quot; procedure against Hungary, seeking to block payments due to alleged violations of public procurement rules. EU accused the Hungarian government of &quot;lack of control and transparency.&quot; According to EU assessments, Budapest was found to be neglecting the bloc&apos;s standards and fundamental values. Hungary agreed to implement reforms to unblock some funds, but 19 billion euros ($20 billion) remained frozen. In July, the European Commission said that Hungary did not meet EU democratic standards, particularly those regarding political financing, conflicts of interest, and media independence. According to the EU regulation on aid conditions, the &quot;first tranche of suspended obligations&quot; of 1.04 billion euros ($1.08 billion) would expire at the end of 2024 without lifting the suspension. Hungary, broadly seen as the most Kremlin-proximate EU member, has repeatedly obstructed aid for Ukraine on account that it &quot;prolongs&quot; and &quot;escalates&quot; the ongoing war. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban also told EU leaders he plans to wait until U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office before deciding on an extension of the bloc&apos;s sanctions against Russia, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 19, citing undisclosed sources.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-loses-out-on-about-1-billion-in-eu-aid/	2025-01-01T12:35:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190744266.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia attacks Kyiv on first day of 2025, killing 2, injuring 6	Key developments on Jan. 1: Russia launched a drone attack on Kyiv on the morning of Jan. 1, killing two people, the Kyiv city military administration said on Telegram, citing its head Tymur Tkachenko. At least six people were injured in the attack, Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service said. The Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on Telegram that the injured included two pregnant women.

(Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service)Russia launched 111 drones, including Iranian-designed Shahed ones, against Ukraine overnight on Jan. 1, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported on its Telegram channel. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 63 drones over 10 oblasts, while another 46 drones did not reach their targets, the Air Force said. &quot;Even on New Year&apos;s Eve, Russia was only concerned with hurting Ukraine,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement posted on his Telegram channel on Jan. 1. &quot;My condolences to the families and friends (of the victims).&quot; He also thanked the army, doctors, and emergency services for their work. Russia has not slowed down its attacks on Ukraine over the holiday period. On Dec. 25, Russia conducted a large-scale Christmas attack, firing 78 missiles and 106 drones against multiple cities. The Russian army has lost over 38,000 troops and more than 1,000 pieces of equipment since the beginning of Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Jan. 1. Syrskyi&apos;s statement comes after his visit to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to reward the Ukrainian military serving in the area. Over 700 servicemen from the Russian military were captured during the Ukrainian incursion, the general added. &quot;We will continue to destroy the invaders. It doesn&apos;t matter whether they have Russian or North Korean passports. The battle continues,&quot; Syrskyi said. Ukraine began its surprise incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, capturing about 1,300 square kilometers of territory, according to Kyiv. Ukrainian forces have lost control of about half of the initially captured territory as intense fighting continues in the region. Kyiv hopes to use the occupied Russian territory as a bargaining chip in future negotiations with Russia. Russia has also stationed approximately 12,000 North Korean soldiers in the region since August to assist in ousting Ukrainian forces. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 23 that more than 3,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or injured since their deployment in Kursk Oblast. Their casualties have been linked to their lack of knowledge of the terrain and modern drone warfare, according to South Korean MP Lee Sung-kwon. In 2024, more Ukrainians were freed from Russian captivity than in the previous year, according to data published by the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War (POWs). Over the past year, Ukraine conducted 11 prisoner exchanges and secured the return of 1,358 people, 356 more than in 2023. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, 3,956 &#xA0;prisoners have been released from Russian captivity. President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed the numbers in his New Year video address published late on Dec. 31. &quot;I&apos;m giving not estimates but precise numbers because each one represents a person, our person, a very important person,&quot; he said. &quot;And with each return &#x2013; we bring life back to Ukraine.&quot; On Dec. 30, Ukraine successfully secured the release of 189 captives from Russian detention, including military personnel and two civilians. The coordination headquarters said it was one of the largest exchanges since the start of the full-scale war. Among those freed were defenders of Azovstal, Mariupol, the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant, Snake Island, and other key Ukrainian strongholds. Among the released were 87 Armed Forces members, 43 National Guard members, 33 border guards, 24 sailors, and fighters from the Azov Regiment. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his New Year video address late on Dec. 31 that no one would give peace to his country as a gift, but he believed the U.S. &#xA0;would stand together with Ukraine as it fights to stop Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. In a 20-minute address, Zelensky thanked the U.S. for providing a wide array of critical military equipment, including 39 multiple-launch rocket systems, 301 Howitzer artillery weapons, and over 300 million units of ammunition. Zelensky added that he has &quot;no doubt that the new American president is willing and capable of achieving peace and ending Putin&apos;s aggression.&quot; &quot;(President-elect Donald Trump) understands that the first is impossible without the second. Because this is not a street fight where you have to calm down both sides. This is the full-scale aggression of a mad state against a civilized one,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;And I believe that we, together with the U.S., are capable of exerting that force.&quot; Zelensky also recalled conversations with outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden, and &quot;everyone who supports us in the U.S.&quot; The Biden administration has provided the most substantial military support to Ukraine among Western nations since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. As of December 2024, the U.S. had committed over $60 billion in military aid and $26 billion in financial assistance to Ukraine, dwarfing the contributions of other major donors such as Germany ($11.4 billion) and the U.K. ($10.1 billion).	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-attacks-ukraines-capital-on-first-day-of-2025-killing-2-injuring-6/	2025-01-01T11:52:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-01-20_34_45.jpeg
Moldova to import electricity from Romania, Ukraine as Russia halts gas supply	Moldova&apos;s state-owned energy company Energocom will import electricity from Romania and Ukraine to cover the shortfall caused by Russia&apos;s halt of gas supplies, NewsMaker media outlet reported on Jan. 1. Russia&apos;s state-owned energy giant Gazprom suspended gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1, allegedly because of the debt of the Moldovagaz gas transportation company. The halt of gas supplies resulted in a heating outage in Moldova&apos;s Russian-controlled region of Transnistria, prompting Chisinau to seek alternative sources of electricity. While the EU has made efforts to reduce dependency on Russian fossil fuels following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, some countries, including Moldova, Slovakia, and Hungary, have remained reliant on Russian gas. Most of Moldova&apos;s electricity needs, 62%, will be covered by imports from Romania, which Chisinau will start receiving in January. About 30% will be covered by thermal power plants and local renewable energy producers, according to NewsMaker.Moldova will also import electricity from Ukraine. Energocom told the media it would import electricity from Ukraine&apos;s state nuclear energy operator, Energoatom, at night when consumption is lower and there is a surplus of resources. In mid-December, a state of emergency was declared in Moldova, partly due to uncertainty over further Russian gas supplies in 2025. The Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom has supplied 5.7 million cubic meters of gas to Moldova since the end of 2022. The entire volume of gas was sent to the Russian-controlled region of Transnistria, where it was used for domestic needs and to generate electricity at the Moldovan hydroelectric power plant, which powered both banks of the Dnister River. Gazprom suspended gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1, allegedly because of the debt of the Moldovagaz, which was not confirmed by an international audit, according to NewsMaker. In response to Moscow&apos;s decision, Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean accused the Kremlin of using energy as a &quot;political weapon.&quot; In a separate move on Jan. 1, Ukraine terminated the transit of Russian gas through Ukrainian territory. Kyiv has repeatedly warned that it would not extend the transit agreement when it expires at the end of 2024 because it did not want to finance Russia&apos;s war. &#xA0; President Volodymyr Zelensky called the termination of gas transfer &quot;one of Moscow&apos;s biggest defeats&quot; on Jan. 1. Zelensky added that one of the main European allies&apos; current tasks is to support Moldova in its energy transformation. &quot;The more gas from Europe&apos;s true partners is available on the market, the sooner the last negative consequences of European energy dependence on Russia will be overcome,&quot; Zelensky said. Moldova, one of Europe&apos;s poorest countries, lies between Ukraine and EU member Romania. As an EU candidate, it aims for membership by 2030 but remains committed to its neutral status. Moldova does not intend to join NATO but plans to strengthen partnerships with various countries and international organizations to bolster its defense capabilities. Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 heightened Moldova&apos;s security concerns, with drone fragments landing on its territory and missiles targeting Ukraine passing through its airspace. Pro-Western President Maia Sandu, re-elected last month, albeit with a narrower margin than expected, accused Russia of attempting to destabilize her government.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-export-electricity-to-moldova-overnight-on-jan-2/	2025-01-01T11:34:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1247620233.jpg
