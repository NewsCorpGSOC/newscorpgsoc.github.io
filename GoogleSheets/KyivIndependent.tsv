Russian losses in Ukraine mount in September, 2nd-deadliest month since start of full-scale invasion	September was the second-deadliest month for Russian forces fighting in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, according to figures released by Kyiv. Adding up, the daily reports from the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces show 38,130 Russian soldiers were reported as casualties last month. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. This figure is only surpassed by that of May 2024, when Ukraine reported 38,940 Russian casualties. According to an analysis of the Ukrainian figures by analyst Ragnar Gudmundsson, four of the top ten bloodiest days for Moscow&apos;s forces since the launch of the full-scale invasion all occurred last month &#x2013; Sept. 22, with 1,500 casualties, Sept. 28, with 1,470, Sept. 21, with 1,440, and Sept. 24, with 1,400. The data doesn&apos;t indicate where the losses occurred, but Russia has continued to make grinding advances in eastern Ukraine, most recently capturing the town of Vuhledar, Donetsk Oblast. Ukraine has published daily estimates of the number of killed and wounded Russian soldiers since the early days of the launch of the full-scale invasion. Initially, there was some skepticism about how accurate the numbers were, which was reflected in the fact that Western nations were at first reluctant to publish their own numbers. &quot;At the start of the war when I was in Moscow, we didn&apos;t speculate on numbers because there was a lot of propaganda flying around,&quot; John Foreman CBE, the U.K.&apos;s former defense attache in Moscow from 2019 to 2022, told the Kyiv Independent earlier this year. &quot;But it seems to me that over the last year and a half or so, the British, American, and Ukrainian estimates have all come together.&quot; Over the course of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine&apos;s Western allies did begin to publicly release their own estimates of Russian losses, and they are broadly in line with those coming out of Kyiv. &quot;The past four months have proved the costliest for Russian forces since the war began in 2022,&quot; a U.K. Military Intelligence report on Sept. 23. The report said Russian casualties, both killed and wounded, were averaging over 1,000 a day and were 1,262 in May, 1,163 in June, 1,140 in July, and 1,187 in August, adding the total number since the start of the full-scale invasion &quot;likely over 610,000.&quot; Compounding the Kremlin&apos;s manpower issues, Russian defense production facilities are suffering an acute personnel shortage. &quot;You have the Armed Forces and the military industry competing with each other for able-bodied men,&quot; Dr Jenny Mathers, senior lecturer in International Politics at Aberystwyth University, told the Kyiv Independent.

(Pablo Miranzo/Anadolu via Getty Images)The full-scale invasion of Ukraine has drained Russia&apos;s labor market and prompted fierce competition between the military and businesses for new recruits. At the same time, Russia&apos;s all-out war has dramatically increased the production of weapons and military equipment. According to an investigation by BBC&apos;s Russian service, thousands of job ads have recently appeared for shift workers at defense enterprises, enticing workers with triple the standard pay, recruiting young people, and offering rewards for referrals of new hires. At the same time, Russia is currently undertaking several steps to increase military manpower, short of announcing what would likely be a hugely unpopular second wave of mobilization. Instead, Vadym Skibitsky, a spokesman for Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence, said in January that around 30,000 volunteer fighters were signing contracts with the Russian military per month. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify this figure, and it is not clear if it has changed since then. But the reluctance to resort to another round of mobilization is also forcing Putin to take more unorthodox measures &#x2013; on Oct. 2 he signed a law that exempts defendants from criminal liability if they join the Russian army. The aim is to conscript 40% of the nearly 60,000 prisoners who are currently held in pre-trial detention centers, according to the independent Russian news outlet IStories. Mathers points out that Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s strict ideology around traditional family values and gender roles means that, at the moment, women aren&apos;t being targeted for recruitment in industry or the military. &quot;I think if they get to the point where they say &apos;ok, now we need the women,&apos; that&apos;s when you can say that they have acknowledged that they&apos;re desperate, that they&apos;re really in dire straits,&quot; she said. &quot;That would be a tipping point.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-losses-in-ukraine-mount-in-september-2nd-deadliest-month-since-start-of-full-scale-invasion/	2024-10-03T07:28:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2003914665.jpg
Lives are more important than buildings' — Zelensky defends Vuhledar withdrawal	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 3 that the decision of the Ukrainian military to withdraw from the front-line town of Vuhledar was &quot;absolutely correct&quot; as it helped save the lives of Ukrainian soldiers. &quot;We cannot stop Russia without appropriate weapons. Then, when they destroy the positions of our troops, we must protect their lives because they are more important than any buildings,&quot; Zelensky said in response to a journalist during a joint press conference with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in Kyiv. Kyiv&apos;s forces announced the withdrawal from the key Donetsk Oblast settlement on Oct. 2 after Russian forces swarmed the town&apos;s flanks and entered Vuhledar itself. Lying in the southern part of the region, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Vuhledar has faced a heavy Russian onslaught since 2022. Ukrainian soldiers who defended the town &quot;are our people, they are Ukrainian citizens. Therefore, it was correct that they left and saved themselves,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;For the sake of our state, for the sake of their heroic service. It was an absolutely correct step.&quot; The president took the opportunity to call upon Ukraine&apos;s partner to speed up their weapons deliveries to help Kyiv fend off Russian aggression. During his address on Sept. 30, Zelensky said that Ukraine faces a &quot;very challenging&quot; situation on the front lines. Apart from Vuhledar, Russian forces have been focusing their efforts against the Donetsk Oblast towns of Pokrovsk and Toretsk, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are forced to withdraw slowly. Russian troops also appear to be preparing for assault operations in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where &quot;the enemy is amassing personnel,&quot; the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command spokesman Vladyslav Voloshyn said on Sept. 28.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-on-vuhedar/	2024-10-03T07:14:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Rutte-Zelensky.jpeg
Russia strikes Chernihiv Oblast, killing 3, injuring 4, including children	Russian forces attacked the Koriukivka district in Chernihiv Oblast on Oct. 3, hitting a car that was carrying liquefied gas, Governor Viacheslav Chaus said. At least three people were killed, including a 6-year-old child, while four others suffered injuries and were hospitalized. A 4-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl were among the injured, according to preliminary data. Both children are in serious condition and receiving medical help at the Chernihiv Regional Children&apos;s Hospital, Chaus said. The gas containers that were being transported in the car detonated following the Russian attack. The fire spread to residential buildings. &quot;Did the Russians know where they were hitting? They definitely did. Moreover, they understood all the consequences. Law enforcement must give a legal assessment of the enemy&apos;s actions. The international community must respond,&quot; Chaus said. The Koriukivka district, with a pre-war population of over 80,000, is located on the border with Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast in the north and regularly comes under Russian attacks. Russian attacks against Ukraine killed two people and injured 41 over the past day, regional authorities said on Oct. 3. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported that Russia launched 105 Shahed-type drones across Ukraine overnight. Seventy-eight were shot down across 15 oblasts, while 23 were lost to electronic warfare, and one flew toward Belarus, the statement said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-strikes-chernihiv-oblast-killing-3-injuring-4-including-children/	2024-10-03T06:46:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-03-16_11_11.jpeg
Ukraine receives Patriot air defense system from Romania	Ukraine received a Patriot air defense system from Bucharest, Romanian Defense Ministry spokesperson Constantin Spinu confirmed for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty on Oct. 3. &quot;I thank every country that helps us with air defense. I am especially grateful to Romania for Patriot systems. Together, we can achieve even greater effectiveness &#x2014; we can put an end to Russian terror by jointly destroying Shahed drones and missiles,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address a day earlier. Hesitant at first, Bucharest decided to donate one of its Patriots in June. The Romanian government issued an order for the system&apos;s delivery last month. Kyiv has been calling on its partners to provide additional air defense assets as Russia intensifies its strikes against cities and energy infrastructure. The highly advanced Patriot systems have played a crucial role in protecting the Ukrainian sky. They are capable of downing even the most advanced ballistic missiles, such as Kinzhals. Ukraine has received at least three Patriot systems from Germany and one from the U.S. Other countries, like the Netherlands and Spain, delivered individual launchers or missiles. The U.S. and the Netherlands also pledged in June to deliver one additional system each, but no announcement on their arrival has been made so far. The Netherlands is still looking for partner countries to provide components for a Patriot air defense system pledged to Ukraine, Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said in September.	https://kyivindependent.com/romania-patriot-arrives/	2024-10-03T06:01:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1242099925-1671654146aso5t.jpg
Switzerland to pledge $1.7 billion for reconstruction projects in Ukraine	Switzerland is planning to allocate 1.5 billion Swiss francs ($1.7 billion) for reconstruction projects in Ukraine over the next four years, Swiss Ambassador to Ukraine and Moldova Felix Baumann said. One billion of the funds will be allocated to the Ukrainian sectors of self-government, demining, and humanitarian aid. The rest of the money will be used for recovery programs involving the Swiss private sector, Ukraine&apos;s Development of communities, territories and infrastructure Ministry reported on Oct. 3. &quot;To emphasize the seriousness of our intentions, our representative will be working here, who will be responsible for the implementation of this project,&quot; Baumann said during a meeting with ministry&apos;s head Oleksii Kuleba. The Ukrainian minister also named the construction of housing for internally displaced people in Ukraine &#x2014; more than 4.5 million &#x2014; among the priorities of cooperation with Switzerland. &quot;We are interested in intensifying regional programs, and we could expand our cooperation within the framework of the funding offered by Switzerland,&quot; he added. After Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Bern has provided economic and humanitarian support for Ukraine and joined EU sanctions against Moscow, breaking from its tradition of political neutrality. Switzerland also hosted the 2022 Ukraine Recovery Conference in Lugano, which laid down principles for Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction and recovery, as well as the first peace summit this summer.	https://kyivindependent.com/switzerland-to-pledge-1-7-billion-for-reconstruction-projects-in-ukraine/	2024-10-03T04:14:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/461996631_942657904569058_3464807016422479889_n.jpg

Ukrainian drones strike Russian airfield in Voronezh Oblast, SBU source says	Drones operated by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) attacked the Borisoglebsk military airfield in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast overnight on Oct. 3, a source in the SBU told the Kyiv Independent. The attack was reportedly carried out together with Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed its air defense destroyed 113 Ukrainian drones overnight, with 25 of them downed over Voronezh Oblast. According to the source, Russian warehouses containing guided aerial bombs, hangars with Su-35 and Su-34 aircraft, and aviation fuel storage facilities were targeted. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the report. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage purporting to show the aftermath of a Ukrainian drone attack on the Borisoglebsk military airfield in Voronezh Oblast, Russia, on Oct. 3, 2024. (Source)&quot;The SBU continues to take active measures to reduce the enemy&apos;s ability to terrorize peaceful Ukrainian cities with fighter jets equipped with KABs,&quot; the source said. Guided aerial bombs known as KABs are precision-guided munitions that have a shorter range than missiles, but are far cheaper to produce. The weapons are launched from aircraft within Russian territory, outside the range of Ukrainian air defense. Russia used almost 900 guided bombs against Ukraine over the past week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 29. Ukrainian forces have previously targeted military airfields, oil refineries, and ammunition depots in Voronezh Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-attack-russian-airfield-in-voronezh-oblast-targets-guided-bombs-warehouses-source-claims/	2024-10-03T02:33:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-03-123858.png
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure 41 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine have killed two people and injured 41 over the past day, regional authorities said on Oct. 3. Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported that Russia launched 105 Shahed-type drones across Ukraine overnight. Seventy-eight were shot down across 15 oblasts, while 23 were lost to electronic warfare, and one flew toward Belarus, the statement said. Russia attacked Kharkiv with a KAB guided bomb overnight, hitting a residential building and injuring at least 12 people, including a child, local authorities reported. Six women and two men also suffered injuries after Russian forces attacked a number of other settlements in Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Russia attacked the town of Nikopol in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast with kamikaze drones and artillery, injuring two men aged 69 and 89, according to Governor Serhii Lysak. Eleven people were injured in the towns of Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, Krasnohorivka, and Hirnyk as well as in the villages of Andriivka, Ulakly, and Pishchanka in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 24 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Two people were killed and eight were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-7-injure-50-over-past-day/	2024-10-03T01:53:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-03_08-43-28.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — Ukraine launches e-residency for foreigners	Ukraine launched an e-residency program this past week, giving some foreigners remote access to services in the country, mainly the ability to open a business and bank account and pay taxes at a favorable rate. The move is part of the country&#x2019;s wider digitalization efforts to counter both bureaucratic difficulties and corruption launched after President Volodymyr&#x2019;s election in 2019 and the creation of the Digital Transformation Ministry. Much of the inspiration for the program, called uResidency in Ukraine, comes from the success of a similar program in Estonia &#x2014; a pioneer of digital government services &#x2014; which made 64.3 million euros in tax revenue last year. Ukraine is hoping to attract $1 million in tax revenue with 1,000 residents in the first year. It&#x2019;s also about showing the world Ukraine&#x2019;s digital transformation. &#x201C;Now foreign entrepreneurs can experience firsthand the digital services that have long made Ukrainians&#x2019; lives easier,&quot; Oleksandr Bornyakov, deputy minister of digital transformation on IT industry development told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;With uResidency, we aim to share our innovative solutions with the world, enhancing the comfort and convenience of doing business for people everywhere.&#x201D; To obtain e-residency status, foreigners don&#x2019;t need to travel to Ukraine &#x2014; which for the unfortunate reason of Russia&#x2019;s war is dangerous and difficult. Those eligible just have to go to their local Ukrainian consulate to verify their documents. So who can and would want to become an e-resident? So far only citizens of India, Pakistan, Thailand, and Slovenia can become e-residents in Ukraine. The program is mostly a good fit for smaller businesses in the IT, gaming, and digital technology sectors, as well as online services in the creative economy like marketing, sales, web design, project management, marketing, and media. Why only these four countries? Slovenia for the simple reason that this country never experienced a significant influx of Ukrainian refugees as the result of Russia&#x2019;s war so their consular services are free to take on some extra requests, the ministry told me. Regarding India, Pakistan, and Thailand, the ministry said that according to their research, there&#x2019;s a strong demand for e-residency in these countries, especially as it gives them closer access to European markets. It&#x2019;s also part of a broader move in Ukraine to reach Asian markets, the ministry said. What are some of the benefits of becoming an e-resident? For one, e-residents can open bank accounts from their phones, with the only in-person involvement the verification step at a consulate. At this stage, e-residency is free. There are no hidden fees, or fees for accounting, and e-residents don&#x2019;t have to pay for accounting through the partner bank, the ministry said. The only costs incurred are taxes and a small fee for banking services. Speaking of taxes, e-residents will pay a tax rate of 5% on an annual income up to 180,000 euros. If they exceed this limit, the tax increases to 15%. The program is still in its infancy, but the ministry told me that during its beta testing phase of the program with nine e-residents the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Whether or not it&#x2019;s successful, I think it&#x2019;s worth noting here briefly that despite the full-scale invasion, despite the missiles and drones descending on Ukrainian cities and towns daily, the government is still taking steps to modernize its economy. According to a recent study by Deloitte Ukraine and Gradus Research, 45% of 1,000 women surveyed toward the end of September said they were considering switching job fields that are traditionally considered to be male jobs. Younger women and those who live in the western, northern regions, and Kyiv were more likely to say they were considering a change. The study also found that higher levels of women are experiencing stress and burnout, with 45% of women saying they are more stressed than last year and 38% saying they are more burnt out. Zhytomyr Mayor Serhii Sukhomlyn is pictured in Kyiv, Ukraine, at an unknown date. (Volodymyr Tarasov/ Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images)Ukraine gets a new restoration agency head, finallyFormer Zhytomyr Mayor Serhii Sukhomlyn is now head of Ukraine&#x2019;s Agency for the Restoration and Development of Infrastructure months after the previous head was pushed out. A bit of background: President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s office barred the former head of the agency, Mustafa Nayyem, from attending the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Berlin in June, prompting him to resign. Just before, it sacked former Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov. Western partners were pretty confused why the President&#x2019;s Office would make such moves right before a conference on, well, rebuilding and restoring infrastructure and raised concerns over Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to protect its vital infrastructure from Russian attacks. While Kubrakov hasn&#x2019;t said much publicly about his firing, Nayyem cited &quot;systemic obstacles&quot; that limited his ability to do his job. Which of course, makes one wonder if Sukhomlyn will have much luck in his new role. While some in the government assert reconstruction is still a priority, it doesn&#x2019;t feel like it from here &#x2014; in some ways understandable given the difficult battlefield situation and the urgency of making emergency repairs on energy infrastructure damaged or destroyed by Russia before it gets really cold. A glimmer of hope: As mayor of Zhytomyr, Sukhomlyn helped to get the city through winter of 2023 with almost no blackouts with good management of base-level consumption.

The plant was sold as part of the government&#x2019;s Big Privatization drive to raise money for the budget by offloading state assets. It was bought by Ukrainian businessman Bohdan Pukish whose bid was up millions from the original starting price of around $484,000. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development revised its growth forecast for Ukraine in 2025 from 6% to 4.7% over the impact Russia&#x2019;s destruction of electricity generation and transmission capacities is having on the country&#x2019;s economy. Donskoy Ugol Trading House&apos;s CEO, Oleg Knyazev, claimed that negotiations on coal supplies from the Donbas region are ongoing with potential buyers from China, India, Iran, Uzbekistan, and Malaysia.

Ukrainian plans to search for Volyn massacre remains a 'step in the right direction,' Polish foreign ministry says	The Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance&apos;s (UINR) announcement that it plans to search for the remains of victims of the Volyn massacre is a &quot;step in the right direction,&quot; the Polish foreign ministry said on Oct. 3. The Volyn massacre refers to the 1943 killing of tens of thousands of Poles by members of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) in Nazi-occupied Volyn, a region that was once part of Poland and is now part of Ukraine. Thousands of Ukrainians were killed in retaliation. Despite several attempts at reconciliation between modern-day Poland and Ukraine, the issue has resurfaced in public discussion multiple times. UINR announced plans on Oct. 2 to begin the search and exhumation of Polish remains in Ukraine&apos;s Rivne Oblast in 2025 in response to petitions from Polish citizens. &#x201C;This is good information and a step in the right direction, but (Polish Foreign Affairs) Minister Radoslaw Sikorski has repeatedly emphasized in talks with Ukrainian partners that we are not waiting for plans, but for a decision. Therefore, we hope that such a decision will indeed be made,&#x201D; Polish Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Pawel Wronski told Polish media outlet PAP. Wronski emphasized that Sikorski &#x201C;does not see this issue as a political dispute, but calls on the Ukrainian side to make a civilized and Christian gesture of remembrance for the victims of the horrific events in Volyn.&#x201D; The exhumation and search for Polish graves in Ukraine, related to the Volyn massacre, was a key topic during the Oct. 1 meeting between Polish parliament speaker Szymon Ho&#x142;ownia and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha. This issue has been the focus of ongoing discussions between Polish and Ukrainian officials. In September, Sikorski visited Kyiv to address key matters with Ukrainian counterparts, including the sensitive topic of resuming the exhumation and Christian burial of victims of the Volyn events. The Volyn massacre remains a highly sensitive issue in Polish-Ukrainian relations, with conflicting perspectives on responsibility and the estimated number of victims. Polish officials have characterized the massacre as genocide, attributing full responsibility to the UPA, while Ukrainian officials have rejected this label and called for recognizing shared responsibility for the killings.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-plans-to-search-for-volyn-massacre-remains-a-step-in-the-right-direction-polish-foreign-ministry-says/	2024-10-03T00:51:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2023-07-09_11-39-24.jpg
Ukraine state-owned enterprises weekly — Issue 149	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This is issue 149 of Ukrainian State-Owned Enterprises Weekly, covering events from Sept. 22-28, 2024. The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission. Naftogaz Group made Hr 24.4 billion in consolidated net profit in the first six months of 2024, the group reported on Sept. 26 (589 million euros at the average exchange rate over that period.) This is nearly four times as much as the group&#x2019;s profit in January-June 2023 (Hr 6.6 billion, or 165 million euros at the average exchange rate over that period). The financial statements were reviewed by PwC and are available on Naftogaz&#x2019;s website. According to Naftogaz Group, its consolidated operating profit for January-June 2024 was Hr 28.9 billion (685 million euros), compared to Hr 14 billion (350 million euros at the average exchange rate) for January-June 2023. The improvements in financial results were driven primarily by increased revenues from the sale of gas, oil, petroleum products, and gas distribution services, Naftogaz Group explained. Additionally, from January to June 2024, the group&#x2019;s companies paid Hr 44 billion (1.043 million euros) in taxes to the state budget, the company said. As we reported earlier, Naftogaz Group paid Hr 6.1 billion (147 million euros) in taxes to state and local budgets for January 2024 (see Issue 119), Hr 5.3 billion (129 million euros) for February (see Issue 123), Hr 8.3 billion (197 million euros) for March (see Issue 128), Hr 8 billion (189 million euros) for April (see Issue 132), Hr 9.3 billion (215 million euros) for May (see Issue 137), Hr 9.2 billion (203 million euros) for June (see Issue 140), Hr 6 billion (132 million euros) for July (see Issue 143), and Hr 7.2 billion (174 million euros) for August (see Issue 143). As we wrote in Issue 115, Naftogaz Group paid Hr 83.4 billion (2.1 billion euros) in taxes to the state budget and another Hr 6.8 billion (172 million euros) to local government budgets in 2023. The group said that it made Hr 23.1 billion (584 million euros) in consolidated net profit in 2023, a significant rebound from its Hr 79.1 billion (2.3 billion euros) loss in 2022. See our Issue 131 for more detail. Kyiv owes Naftogaz Hr 20.7 billion ($500 million), part of the debt is to be restructured for 15 years. According to EP&#x2019;s sources, the municipal heat supplier Kyivteploenergo (owned by the Kyiv City Council) owes Naftogaz Hr 20.7 billion ($500 million) as of early September 2024. The total debt consists of three major parts, the media outlet added. The first part is Hr 6.4 billion ($154 million) for natural gas consumed before 2022. It is planned to restructure this part for 15 years. The second part of more than Hr 7 billion ($169 million) is the difference in tariffs as of July 1. One would guess that this refers to the amount of debt resulting from the difference between the market prices and administratively set preferential tariffs for households and other consumer categories, although is not entirely clear from the information given by the media. The third one, more than Hr 7.2 billion ($173 million), is the debt to Naftogaz Trading, which can also potentially be settled via amicable agreements with instalments of up to 4 years, EP also wrote. Based on the available information, it is not clear how the &#x201C;third part&#x201D; is conceptually different from the &#x201C;first&#x201D; or &#x201C;second&#x201D; parts, and whether the &#x201C;second part&#x201D; can be restructured like the &#x201C;first part&#x201D; or settled via amicable agreements like the &#x201C;third part.&quot; One would expect to see this type of information in Naftogaz&#x2019;s annual reports, typically as part of management&#x2019;s discussion and analysis. However, although Naftogaz had published such reports since the launch of its corporate governance reform in 2014 (covering the year 2014 and on), it stopped publishing them in 2023. This is all the more remarkable because the company was able to publish an annual report in wartime (covering the year 2021, published in 2022), when it had no supervisory board, while it stopped publishing them after it got a new supervisory board in January 2023. EP&#x2019;s source noted the lion&#x2019;s share of the total debt has accumulated since 2018. &#x201C;Among the cities, Kharkiv and Kyiv are (Naftogaz&#x2019;s) largest debtors today. It is clear with Kharkiv &#x2014; many people have left the city, and utility payments dropped; however, it is the other way round in Kyiv &#x2014; people keep living in the city and paying for these services. The payments only dropped in the first months of the full-scale war (end-February 2022), and then everything leveled off. The question is then, where did these debts come from and &#x2014; if Kyiv&#x2019;s authorities are not addressing them &#x2014; why are they laying (new) asphalt and paving (instead of paying their debts)? In fact, this is happening at the expense of Naftogaz,&#x201D; a representative of the state-owned company said. According to EP&#x2019;s source, a meeting of Naftogaz&#x2019;s supervisory board was scheduled for Sept. 26 to consider restructuring part of the debt. (There were no public releases on this meeting or its decisions from Naftogaz at the time of writing.) EP&#x2019;s source in the government wondered why part of the debt was planned to be restructured for an unprecedented 15 years. &#x201C;Why not eight or ten years, for example, why 15 years? There is no substantial justification for this decision, no one has seen them,&#x201D; he said. As we wrote in June 2024 (Issue 135), Naftogaz assured that it would continue to supply gas to electricity and heat producers to support Ukraine&#x2019;s energy system. According to Naftogaz&#x2019;s CEO Oleksiy Chernyshov, the company has the resources to do so. He then pointed out that the debts of large heat and power producers for gas remained a significant problem. &#x201C;We are already supplying gas to these companies at the price set by the state. These funds are necessary for the stability of gas supply, so solving the debt problem is also urgent for the stability of the system,&#x201D; he then said. Chernyshov also added that Naftogaz would continue to supply gas to Kyiv&#x2019;s energy companies in a stable manner. As of June 2024, Kyiv has paid 100% for the gas consumed in the 2023/2024 heating season, he said. See Issue 135 for more detail. As we reported in Issue 68, the government ordered Naftogaz to sell gas at a discount to multiple types of consumers, including households, heating companies, certain thermal power plants, non-household consumers from the defence sector, and regional gas distribution companies. Most of the public service obligations (PSOs) are linked to the duration of martial law. As we wrote in Issue 77, Naftogaz estimated its net losses in 2022 at Hr 40 billion ($966 million). Chernyshov then blamed significant receivables that arose due to the state&#x2019;s use of Naftogaz&#x2019;s working capital to meet the needs of energy consumers. He said that the company&#x2019;s underlying receivables had three components: the difference in tariffs (Hr 36 billion, or $869 million), the debt of regional gas suppliers and gas distribution companies (Hr 76 billion, or $1.8 million), and PSOs for 2022-2023 (Hr 158 billion, or $3.8 billion).&#x202F;See our Issue 77 for more detail. In December 2023, EP wrote that, according to USAID, the total level of unsettled debts in the gas market exceeded Hr 190 billion ($4.6 billion) in early September 2023 (see our Issue 113). According to the data of the National Energy and Utilities Regulatory Commission (NEURC) seen by EP, the total debt exceeded Hr 200 billion ($4.8 billion) as of Oct. 1, 2023. &#x201C;Our goal is to gradually move to economically justified energy tariffs and cancel all PSOs by the fourth quarter of 2025. This should be done in conjunction with the systematic settlement of debts in the gas and district heating markets,&#x201D; Oleksandr Butenko, then deputy minister of communities, territories and infrastructure, explained. See Issue 113 for more detail. However, Naftogaz has recently kept the current gas tariff for households unchanged for at least another year. As before, customers can buy a cubic meter of gas for Hr 7.96 including VAT ($0.19). The tariff remains valid through April 30,2025. See Issue 129 for more detail. Further gas supplies at a reduced tariff will likely result in corresponding losses for Naftogaz, even if heat and power producers pay for gas. The Rada adopts a law on privatization of state-owned banks. On Sept. 19, the Verkhovna Rada adopted Draft Law No. 11474 on the peculiarities of the sale of state-owned stakes in the authorized capital of banks. According to liga.net, one of the key provisions of the law, which was a requirement of the World Bank, is to allow the sale of any state stake in the bank, not just 100% of the shares, as provided for by the current legislation. The decision to prepare the bank&#x2019;s stake for sale would be made by the Cabinet of Ministers, taking into account the opinion of the Financial Stability Council. It would also be up to the Cabinet to decide whether to put the stake up for sale after all the necessary preparations are completed, the media also explained. If the auction is held in Ukraine, the shares would be sold on Prozorro.Sale. If the auction is held abroad, the method of bidding will depend on the Cabinet&#x2019;s decision, taking into account the recommendations of the sales advisor. According to liga.net, this law applies to five state-owned banks &#x2014; PrivatBank, Ukrgasbank, Sense Bank, PIN Bank, and Motor-Bank &#x2014; but not to Oschadbank and Ukreximbank. Sense Bank, PIN Bank, and Motor-Bank were nationalized after the beginning of the full-scale war in 2022. See our Issues 98, 116, and 138 for more detail. PrivatBank and Ukrgasbank had been nationalized earlier. Oschadbank and Ukreximbank have been state-owned since establishment. According to the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), the state&#x2019;s share in the banking sector exceeds 50%, although NBU&#x2019;s First Deputy Governor Kateryna Rozhkova said that &#x201C;more than 25% is already too much.&quot; As we wrote in January 2024 (Issue 116), foreign investors were interested in buying Ukrgasbank and Sense Bank. As we reported in June 2024 (Issue 138), according to the updated IMF Memorandum, the Cabinet of Ministers was preparing to sell two systemic state-owned banks, Sense Bank and Ukrgasbank, and planned to appoint an internationally recognised financial adviser by end-September 2024. On Sept. 10, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal confirmed that privatization was planned for Ukrgasbank and Sense Bank, but also said that it was difficult to say when this would happen. Shmyhal added that the Cabinet was not currently considering the privatization of Oschadbank or Ukreximbank, and there was no strategy for their sale. In 2017, two members of the SOE Weekly team, Andriy Boytsun and Dmytro Yablonovskyi, published a policy paper titled &#x201C;What Should the State Do with its Banks?&#x201D; They concluded that the risks of state ownership of banks in Ukraine outweighed the benefits, suggesting that all state-owned banks should be privatized. The state can obtain the same services from private banks or international development finance institutions. According to the State-Owned Banks Reform Strategy that the government adopted in 2020, the state intended to privatise all state-owned banks. Rada aims to increase the income tax for banks to 50% retroactively for a second year in a row. On Sept. 17, the Verkhovna Rada passed Draft Law No. 11416-d on tax increases in the first reading to finance the needs of the state budget. According to Forbes Ukraine, compared to the version approved by the Rada&#x2019;s Committee on Finance, Tax and Customs Policy at its meeting on Aug. 29, the Rada added a provision to increase the income tax for banks from 25% to 50% in 2024. This could generate Hr 27.3 billion ($661 million) in state budget revenues in 2024 and Hr 9.3 billion ($225 million) in 2025. This idea was not supported by the Finance Ministry and the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU). Deputy Minister of Finance Svitlana Vorobey expressed fears that banks would not increase their holdings of government bonds in this case, while, according to the ministry&#x2019;s calculations, the bonds are expected to bring in more than Hr 200 billion ($4.8 billion) in additional revenues by the end of 2024. However, according to lawmaker Yaroslav Zheleznyak, later the ministry did agree to increased taxes for banks. Since the law would not be adopted as a whole by October 2024, the implementation would be retroactive to Oct. 1, Zheleznyak added. At the same time, the NBU considers an increase in banks&#x2019; profit tax to 50% too risky. &#x201C;The risks of such a step to solve the problem of financing the deficit and stable credit growth would be greater than the benefits. The balance is quite fragile and needs to be maintained,&#x201D; NBU Governor Andriy Pyshnyi said. On Sept. 17, Pyshnyi announced that the NBU would develop a package of measures to ensure that banks expand their coverage of the state budget deficit via the purchase of government bonds, and without the NBU issuing new money. Later, in his interview with Forbes Ukraine, Pyshnyi explained that the NBU and the Finance Ministry were developing individual strategies for banks to raise domestic government bonds to finance budget needs. He expects the biggest contribution from state-owned banks. Pyshnyi also expects that the NBU would have a constructive discussion with lawmakers on this draft law before the second reading. According to NBU&#x2019;s First Deputy Governor Kateryna Rozhkova, if banks&#x2019; incomes are retroactively taxed at 50% (instead of 25%), two state-owned banks, Ukreximbank and Sense Bank, would be in violation of their capital requirements. This would require an additional capitalization of these banks, meaning a spending of Hr 3 billion ($72 million) from the state budget, Rozhkova emphasized. Note that this is not the first time the Rada has taken steps to raise banks&#x2019; income taxes to 50%. In 2023, parliament adopted a law increasing taxes for banks, with key changes concerning the income tax rate. That rate had been 18%, but the law introduced a windfall income tax of 50% for 2023, applied retrospectively. The income tax as from Jan. 1, 2024 was then set at 25%. See Issue 113 for more detail. As we reported in Issue 146, Ukrainian banks posted cumulative profits of Hr 120 billion ($2.9 billion) in January-July 2024, with the state-owned banks making 63% of the total. SPFU sets confiscated Motordetal-Konotop&#x2019;s starting price at $6.7 million. On Sept. 26, the auction commission of the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) set the terms for the privatization of Motordetal-Konotop LLC, a plant confiscated earlier from sanctioned Russian senator Sergey Kalashnik. Located in Sumy Oblast, Motordetal-Konotop is one of Ukraine&#x2019;s largest producers of piston rings for internal combustion engines, the SPFU said. The starting price was set at Hr 278.5 million ($6.7 million at the current exchange rate). Other terms include preserving the company&#x2019;s business; repaying wage arrears, debts to the state budget, and overdue accounts payable (except for debts to sanctioned, Russian, or Belarusian individuals or legal entities); preventing personnel lay-offs for six months; and other standard terms. The SPFU did not say what amount of Motordetal-Konotop&#x2019;s debt was to be paid, which makes it difficult to estimate the effective amount that the prospective buyers would have to pay to acquire the asset. The privatization terms, including the starting price, are yet to be approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. All proceeds from this sale will go to the Fund for the Liquidation of Consequences of Armed Aggression, the SPFU added. Motordetal-Konotop was transferred to the management of the SPFU by a ruling of the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) in 2023. J seeks to confiscate Myrhorodska, Morshynska, and Alfa Insurance from Fridman, Aven, and Kosogov. On Sept. 25, the Justice Ministry reported that it filed a lawsuit with the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) to confiscate these Ukrainian assets of the sanctioned Russian oligarchs. According to the release, this concerns Myrhorod Plant of Mineral Waters (producer of Myrhorodska mineral water), Morshyn Plant of Mineral Waters Oskar (producer of Morshynska mineral water), Industrial and Distribution Systems, as well as IDS Aqua Service LLC, Potuzhnist LLC, IVA PE, and NOVA.COM SE, which are indirectly owned by Rissa Investments. According to Schemes investigative journalists, Rissa Investments Limited is 49.99% owned by sanctioned Russian oligarchs Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven, and Andrey Kosogov. According to the ministry, Rissa is a holding company whose subsidiaries produce and distribute mineral waters, in particular, in Ukraine, Russia, and Georgia. Together with Rissa, they form the Borjomi group of companies. In addition, the ministry is asking to seize 82% of the shares of Alfa Insurance and 86% of the shares of Alfa-Leasing Ukraine LLC, Paritet Finance LLC, Sense Digital LLC, and Universal Leasing Company ALFA LLC, which are indirectly owned by Fridman, Aven, and Kosogov. The lawsuit is based, in part, on the Schemes&#x2019; investigation, the media outlet noted. In May 2023, Schemes found out that the Russian company Alfa Insurance (AlfaStrakhovanie), controlled by Fridman, provides the Russian Guard with insurance services for official vehicles, including vehicles of military units directly involved in the full-scale war against Ukraine and supporting the Russian regime in the occupied territories. Investigators also found that another Fridman&#x2019;s Russian company, X5 Retail Group, continued to cooperate with Russia&#x2019;s military-industrial complex during the full-scale war, namely with the Voyentorg enterprise of the Russian Defense Ministry, which provides the Russian military forces with uniforms and food. As we reported earlier, Sense Bank, previously owned by Fridman, Aven, and Kosogov, was nationalized in late July 2023. See more in our Issue 98. HACC seized sanctioned Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov&#x2019;s assets for over Hr 2 billion ($48 million), Inna Bogatykh, deputy justice minister, wrote on her Facebook page on Sept. 26. More than 165,000 metric tons of iron ore products with an estimated value of more than Hr 2 billion ($48 million) and IT company Peter-Service Ukraine, previously controlled by Usmanov, were seized, she explained. The deadline for challenging the decision in an appellate court was running out. The Justice Ministry is doing its best to have the first-instance court&#x2019;s decision upheld, Bogatykh added. As we wrote in December 2022 and February 2023, the Economic Security Bureau of Ukraine handed over almost 170,000 metric tons of Usmanov&#x2019;s iron ore to the Asset Recovery and Management Agency (ARMA).

Ukraine hits Russian long-range radar system with US-supplied ATACMS, military says	Ukrainian forces struck a Russian Nebo-M radar system using U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Oct. 3. The Nebo-M, valued at about $100 million, is designed to detect and intercept aerial threats, including ballistic missiles. Ukraine&apos;s military said the radar&apos;s destruction would open an &quot;air corridor&quot; for more effective use of Storm Shadow and Scalp-EG cruise missiles. Russia is believed to have only 10 operational Nebo-M systems remaining, though the Kyiv Independent could not verify this claim. Earlier this year, Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) targeted a modernized &#xA0;Nebo-U radar system in Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast, according to an SBU source.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hits-russian-long-range-radar-system-with-us-supplied-atacms-military-says/	2024-10-03T00:25:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/e4d11b96-e81f-4295-9055-53fb68cd56e5.jpeg
Ukraine's victory plan includes 'productive steps,' US State Department says	The United States has reviewed Ukraine&apos;s victory plan and identified &quot;a number of productive steps,&quot; U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said during an Oct. 2 briefing. President Volodymyr Zelensky presented the five-point plan to U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House on Sept. 26 and discussed it with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, as well as members of Congress. &quot;The victory plan that Ukraine presented is not just a question of actions that Ukraine would take. It&#x2019;s a question of actions that other countries around the world would take as well,&quot; Miller said. The plan includes military and diplomatic elements, such as Ukraine&#x2019;s bid to join NATO, though the full details of the peace framework have not been made public. According to Kyiv, the goal is to bolster Ukraine&#x2019;s negotiating position and pressure Russia into agreeing to a just peace. Miller declined to provide further specifics. &quot;But we took that plan, we reviewed it, we saw a number of productive steps in it,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#x2019;re going to engage with them (Ukraine) about it.&quot; While Zelensky was in the U.S. last week, reports suggested the White House was concerned the plan lacks a clear strategy for defeating Russia. Following the visit, presidential spokesperson Serhii Nykyforov said Washington had responded to the plan &quot;constructively.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-victory-plan-includes-productive-steps-us-state-department-says/	2024-10-02T23:43:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2123624992.jpg
Russia launches mass drone attack on Ukraine, 15 drones downed in Kyiv	About 15 Russian drones were detected and shot down near Kyiv overnight on Oct. 3, city authorities said. The air raid alert in Ukraine&#x2019;s capital lasted 5.5 hours, with explosions reported in Kyiv and surrounding areas. Drone attacks on Kyiv have increased in recent weeks, with Russia launching several groups of drones at night, approaching from various directions and altitudes, according to the Kyiv City Military Administration. &quot;The enemy launched the first groups of drones before midnight, but more and more UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) were constantly added throughout the night,&quot; authorities reported on Oct. 3. &quot;Nevertheless, none of the Russian drones reached their target.&quot; Debris from downed drones fell in Kyiv&#x2019;s Desnianskyi district. No damage or injuries were reported. Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported that Russia launched 105 Shahed-type drones across Ukraine overnight. Seventy-eight were shot down across 15 oblasts, while 23 were lost to electronic warfare, and one flew toward Belarus, the statement said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-mass-drone-attack-on-ukraine-with-around-15-downed-over-kyiv/	2024-10-02T23:35:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2168150121.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 656,710 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 656,710 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 3. This number includes 1,150 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 8,893 tanks, 17,596 armored fighting vehicles, 25,750 vehicles and fuel tanks, 18,906 artillery systems, 1,204 multiple launch rocket systems, 964 air defense systems, 368 airplanes, 328 helicopters, 16,393 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-656-710-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-02T22:58:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2163474773.jpg
Croatian president opposes country's participation in NATO's Ukraine mission	Croatian President Zoran Milanovic has refused to approve the participation of Croatian soldiers in NATO&apos;s mission to support Ukraine, citing concerns about the conflict potentially spreading to Croatia and prioritizing the safety of his country. This decision contradicts the support package agreed upon at the July NATO summit, which included establishing the NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) to coordinate military aid and training for Ukraine by partners. The aim of NSATU is to support the transformation of Ukraine&apos;s Defense and Security Forces, ensuring further integration with NATO. Milanovic&apos;s refusal has sparked criticism from Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic, who called it &quot;manipulation&quot; that harms Croatia&apos;s international standing. Plenkovic argued that the decision only affected the deployment of a few officers to a NATO command in Germany, and that Croatia would not become directly involved in the war. This is not the first time the two leaders have disagreed on Ukraine policies. The Croatian government, mainly aligned with Plenkovic, has strongly supported military aid to Kyiv, including the delivery of 14 Mi-8 helicopters, and Plenkovic himself has made several visits to Ukraine. In contrast, Milanovic has criticized Western sanctions on Russia and opposed the provision of arms to Ukraine, highlighting a clear divide between him and the government. Despite Croatia&#x2019;s decision, NATO has reaffirmed its commitment to supporting Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/croatian-president-opposes-countrys-participation-in-natos-ukraine-mission/	2024-10-02T20:54:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/milanovic.jpg
Biden, Xi to hold phone discussion in coming days	A phone call is being planned between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in the coming days. This comes after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized the importance of maintaining communication between the two countries&apos; leaders. A key topic for the U.S. is China&apos;s support for Russia, particularly China&apos;s role in bolstering Russia&apos;s military capabilities. Beijing has emerged as one of Russia&apos;s leading sources of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry. Recently, a Reuters report suggested that a Chinese company is providing lethal assistance to a U.S.- sanctioned Russian firm, IEMZ Kupol, which is developing drones for use in Ukraine. Meanwhile, China is marking 75 years of Communist Party rule, with President Xi reiterating his intention to &quot;reunite&quot; Taiwan with mainland China, despite U.S. support for Taiwan&apos;s defense under the Taiwan Relations Act. Faced with daily threats, Taiwan has been ordering U.S. weapons, further soaring Washington-Beijing tensions. As soon as Russia launched its full-scale invasion, Taiwan followed Western allies in imposing sanctions on Moscow and sending humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Taiwan ranks forth among Indo-Pacific nations in commitments to Ukraine, after Japan, Australia, and South Korea. The Taiwanese government has provided more than $110 million in aid since February 2022. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has identified Russia, Iran, and China as the most significant threats to critical infrastructure and democratic institutions in the United States. A DHS report, published on October 2, highlighted concerns about potential interference in the upcoming presidential election.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-xi-to-hold-phone-discussion-in-coming-days/	2024-10-02T19:26:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1435873849.jpg
US names Russia, Iran, China as biggest threats to presidential election	Russia, Iran, and China pose the most significant threats to critical infrastructure and democratic institutions in the United States, particularly the upcoming presidential election, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a report published Oct. 2. The report comes a month after the U.S. announced a sweeping crackdown on Russian propaganda outlets due to alleged election interference. Hostile foreign actors may use an array of tactics to undermine electoral operations, including using generative AI to create authentic-seeming text and video to spread disinformation, the DHS report said. &quot;Russia seeks to shape electoral outcomes, undermine electoral integrity, and amplify domestic divisions, while using a variety of approaches to bolster its messaging and lend an air of authenticity to its efforts,&quot; the report said. &quot;Iran, meanwhile, perceives this year&apos;s elections as particularly consequential for its own national security interests.&quot; DHS warned that Russia, Iran, and China have &quot;increasingly used generative AI to create more believable text, inauthentic synthetic audio, and video that may enhance their ability to reach U.S. audiences while hiding their origins.&quot; The U.S. is one month away from the presidential election, which sees former President Donald Trump facing Vice President Kamala Harris. The campaign has been fraught with turmoil, including assassination attempts, the withdrawal of President Joe Biden, and allegations of foreign interference. Iranian operatives have been indicted for allegedly hacking emails connected to Trump&apos;s campaign. The DHS report said that U.S. intelligence &quot;is confident&quot; that Iran has attempted to access individuals tied to both parties&apos; campaigns. &#xA0; The U.S. on Sept. 4 also sanctioned high-profile propagandists including RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan and seized 32 internet domains linked to Kremlin propaganda campaigns, alleging that the outlets attempted to interfere in the upcoming election. Russia has previously been accused of using social media disinformation, bot farms, and other means to back Donald Trump against his Democratic opponents &#x2013; Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden &#x2013; during the 2016and 2020 elections. Iran and China have remained Russia&apos;s key military and economic allies since the onset of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-names-russia-iran-china-as-biggest-threats-to-presidential-election/	2024-10-02T17:01:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2171254794.jpg
Ukraine wants UN nuclear watchdog to place foreign observers near all its nuclear plants	Ukraine is in talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to place foreign observers near its nuclear power plants amid reports Russia is planning to attack the infrastructure connecting the plants to the country&apos;s energy grid, an Energy Ministry official said. President Volodymyr Zelensky warned on Sept. 24 &#xA0;that Russia is planning to strike three power plants as it continues its broader strategy of targeting and crippling Ukraine&apos;s energy system for the third year in a row. While Zelensky did not specify which ones, the country only has three operating nuclear facilities &#x2014; Rivne and Khmelnytskyi plants in the country&apos;s west, and the Pivdennoukrainsk plant in the south. The Chornobyl plant is decommissioned, while the Zaporizhzhia plant has been under Russian occupation since 2022. Yuliia Kyian, director general for Strategic Planning and European Integration at Ukraine&#x2019;s Energy Ministry reiterated while speaking at a discussion in Kyiv on Oct. 2 that Russia could target infrastructure, like substations, that are connected to plants. Placing foreign observers near all its power plants &#x2014; though not directly inside of the plants &#x2014; could help to ensure nuclear and energy stability, Kyian said during the discussion, which was on the topic of energy security organized by the DiXi Group, Eastern Circles, and Prism Ukraine. &quot;Our highest priority is to safeguard these crucial assets, and we are currently in discussions regarding IAEA missions that could assist in protecting these energy facilities. Deploying such missions would demonstrate to the world that the proper operation of these facilities is vital for nuclear safety and security,&quot; Kyian told the Kyiv Independent after the talk. &#x201C;Attacks on nuclear plants and additional infrastructure is a threat to the whole world,&#x201D; she said. While Ukraine has physical constructions protecting some of its energy facilities, Kyian noted that they are not enough to prevent damage from ballistic missiles and Ukraine lacks air defense systems to fully shield against such attacks.Nuclear power is Ukraine&#x2019;s main source of energy and damage to substations could prevent nuclear plants from feeding electricity to the grid or stop backup supplies that ensure the safety of reactors, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). International observers are just one idea Ukraine has suggested to safeguard its energy sector in the lead-up to a winter that Ukrainian energy think tank DixiGroup analysts warn could entail eight-hour blackouts.Currently, Kyiv is discussing the proposal with the IAEA, the global agency for nuclear safety, although Kyian did not disclose the status of the negotiations or the IAEA&#x2019;s response. She added that Ukraine has also raised the issue with the EU.Since September 2022, the IAEA has had a mission at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Russian authorities still deny inspectors full access to the plant.Russia&apos;s occupation of the Zaporizhzhia plant has led to heightened nuclear safety risks, with Ukraine repeatedly accusing Moscow of using the plant to deploy military personnel and store ammunition and explosives.Prior to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, nuclear power generated half of Ukraine&#x2019;s electricity. The occupation of the plant in Zaporizhzhia took out a quarter of Ukraine&#x2019;s electricity supply. In March 2024, Russia amped up its attacks on energy infrastructure. By May, Ukraine lost a further 9GW of generation capacity after strikes damaged thermal and hydro plants forcing the country to rely more on nuclear power.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-discussing-with-atomic-agency-to-place-missions-near-all-its-nuclear-power-plants/	2024-10-02T14:32:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1600485522.jpg
Russian guided bomb hits apartment building in Kharkiv, wounding at least 9	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia attacked Kharkiv with a KAB guided bomb the night of Oct. 2, hitting a residential building and injuring at least nine people, including a child, local authorities reported. A Russian KAB guided bomb struck a five-story apartment building between the third and fourth floors, injuring at least nine people, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. One of the victims is a three-year-old girl, he said. All residents of the building are being evacuated, and emergency workers are working at the attack site. &#xA0; The strike also caused a fire at the building that spread to nearby vehicles. At least 10 vehicles were in flames following the attack. The full consequences of the attack are currently being investigated. President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the bombing on his official Telegram channel, posting a video of the damaged building and calling on world leaders to help Ukraine prevent such attacks. &quot;For such Russian strikes to stop, Ukraine must receive the necessary and, most importantly, sufficient assistance from the world and its partners,&quot; he said. Kharkiv has endured constant Russian attacks for over two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The last few months have seen intensifying strikes against densely-populated areas of the city.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-guided-bomb-hits-high-rise-in-kharkiv-wounding-at-least-8/	2024-10-02T13:39:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/kharkiv-1.png
Russian proxies in occupied Kherson Oblast announce forced conscription of Ukrainians	Ukrainian men in the Russian-occupied part of Kherson Oblast will be subject to conscription into the Russian army from now until the end of the year, according to Volodymyr Saldo, Russia&apos;s proxy leader in the occupied region. Men aged 18 to 30 will be subject to conscription for a period of 12 months. Russia carried out a similar round of forced conscription in fall of 2023, drafting Ukrainians in the illegally occupied areas of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts along with Russian citizens. The conscription round began on Oct. 1 and will last until Dec. 31, 2024, Saldo said. Conscripts from occupied Kherson Oblast will be called to serve in Russia&apos;s Southern Military District, which includes illegally annexed Ukrainian territories. New conscripts will not be sent to front-line areas or directly involved in the full-scale invasion, Saldo claimed. In response to Saldo&apos;s announcement, Yurii Sobolevsky, deputy head of Kherson Oblast Council, advised Ukrainians living under occupation to flee to E.U. countries or other safe regions. &quot;It was clear that sooner or later the enemy would use our human resources to make our people participate in this war,&quot; Soboloevsky said in a comment to Suspilne. Forced conscription under occupation constitutes a war crime under international law. Russia has reportedly conscripted tens of thousands of Ukrainian citizens in the occupied parts of Ukraine to fight against their own country since the start of the full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. Many of them are believed to have been killed in action, as Moscow reportedly uses these people as cannon fodder to expose Ukrainian artillery positions and to cover units recruited inside Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-proxies-in-occupied-kherson-oblast-announce-forced-conscription-of-ukrainians/	2024-10-02T12:56:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1245743135.jpeg
Ukraine war latest: Ukrainian forces withdraw from Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast	Key developments on Oct. 2: Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from the town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, the Khortytsia group of forces said on Oct. 2. &quot;The higher command authorized a maneuver to withdraw units from Vuhledar in order to save personnel and military equipment, and take up a position for further operations,&quot; it said in a statement. Ukraine&apos;s 72nd Mechanized Brigade has defended Vuhledar, key to Ukrainian defenses in the southern part of Donetsk Oblast, for nearly two years. Russian forces have been attempting to capture the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Vuhledar withstood numerous attacks in recent weeks as Russian forces attempted to encircle the town. Local authorities confirmed that Russian troops entered Vuhledar on Oct. 1, adding that fighting was ongoing. Russia tried to capture the town &quot;at any cost&quot; by sending reserves to attack its flanks, which exhausted defending Ukrainian units, the military said. &quot;As a result of the enemy&apos;s actions there was a threat of the town being encircled,&quot; the statement added. The front-line town lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Vuhledar is located north of a key intersection connecting the O-0532 road towards Vodiane and Kostiantynivka, a small paved road toward Kurakhove, and the partly occupied T-0509 highway toward Velyka Novosilka. &quot;It is, therefore, a key logistic point for Ukrainian forces defending the southern flank of Kurakhove,&quot; Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent last month. Vuhledar was also the last fortified town before the village of Velyka Novosilka and the entire southern part of Donetsk Oblast that Ukraine controls. The occupied section of the T-0509 highway, which passes south of Vuhledar, is essential for Russian forces trying to advance westward. Ukraine is planning to increase its production of drones, long-range and ballistic missiles in 2025, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Oct. 1 at Ukraine&apos;s second international defense industry forum. Domestically produced long-range weapons are of key importance to Ukraine&apos;s defense strategy, as Western partners refuse to authorize deep strikes in Russia with foreign-made missiles. Ukraine began actively developing its missile program after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. In late July, President Volodymyr Zelensky said the program had &quot;good dynamics.&quot; He then announced in August that Ukraine had carried out a successful test of its first domestically-made ballistic missile. According to Umerov, $4 billion has been already invested in the development of the Ukrainian defense industry. &quot;Next year we plan to increase funding. Our priority is to develop domestic drones and long-range weapons, including ballistic missiles,&quot; the minister added. Speaking at the Forum, Umerov said that Kyiv also wants to unveil more details about a major Ukrainian missile program later this year or in 2025, Interfax-Ukraine reported. In addition, the defense ministry aims to attract foreign partners to create joint ventures to develop the defense industry. &quot;An important part of this cooperation is the signing of long-term contracts for the production, supply, and maintenance of weapons to ensure that the Ukrainian army is supplied for the long term,&quot; a statement from the ministry read. Around 1.5 million Ukrainian children who remain in occupied areas of Ukraine are at high risk of being deported to Russia, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said on Oct. 2. Russia has already abducted more than 20,000 children since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Lubinets said. Less than 400 of them have been returned home, according to the Children of War database. Deported children have their personal data changed so that their relatives cannot find and bring them back home, the ombudsman added. &quot;Our children are even sent to so-called &apos;re-education camps&apos; where they are zombified with Russian propaganda. Just imagine: our children are forced to deny their Ukrainian origin,&quot; Lubinets said. Kyiv also recorded cases of children being illegally adopted by Russian families. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova for their roles in the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children. The unlawful transfer or deportation of civilians to Russia violates the Fourth Geneva Convention and constitutes a war crime under international law. At least 589 Ukrainian civilians were killed and another 2,685 injured in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine between June 1 and Aug. 31, according to a report by the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) published on Oct. 1. The number of victims in the summer increased by 45% compared to the OHCHR&apos;s spring monitoring, the report reads. Over the summer, 324 men, 238 women, 14 girls, and 13 boys were killed, while 1,353 men, 1,155 women, 104 boys, and 73 girls were injured. The month of July 2024 was the deadliest for civilians in Ukraine since October 2022, according to the OHCHR. The OHCHR said the main cause of the high number of civilian casualties in July was a large-scale coordinated attack of dozens of missiles launched by Russia at targets across Ukraine on July 8, which killed 44 people and injured 196, as Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service reported. The Russian army&apos;s efforts to establish control over the territory of the eastern Donetsk Oblast also resulted in many civilian casualties, the OHCHR added. At least 10,582 civilians have been killed and nearly 20,000 have been injured since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) said on Feb. 22. The figure of 10,582, which includes 587 children, consists of civilian deaths verified according to UN methodology. The number of dead and injured in fighting immediately after the outbreak of the full-scale war has yet to be fully accounted for, and some of the places that saw the heaviest combat in early 2022 are still under Russian occupation, making it impossible for outside observers to investigate. NATO lacks adequate air defenses, military mobility, ammunition, and the mindset to be fully ready for a potential large-scale conventional war, retired U.S. Lieutenant General Ben Hodges said on Oct. 2. Speaking at a discussion at the Warsaw Security Forum attended by the Kyiv Independent, Hodges said that many of Europe&apos;s political and military leaders do not fully acknowledge the realities of a possible war with Russia. Warnings about a clash between Russia and NATO have mounted since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with many observers pointing out insufficient defense-industrial base and battle readiness on the West&apos;s part. &quot;We don&apos;t have adequate missile and air defense to protect our seaports, airports, and critical infrastructure,&quot; Hodges said. NATO&apos;s eastern flank has only 5% of the air defense capabilities necessary to deter an attack, the Financial Times reported in May. &quot;We still... cannot move quickly throughout Europe, so the issue of military mobility is still a challenge that needs to be resolved,&quot; the retired general added. If Russia decided to attack NATO, its forces would immediately strike European transport infrastructure that the allies need to respond, according to Hodges. &quot;So imagine a week of what&apos;s happening in Ukraine to happen in Gdansk, or Klaipeda, or Tallinn, or Bremerhaven,&quot; he went on. In the worst-case scenario, Lithuania would have to wait for two weeks for the arrival of reinforcements, he added. Echoing the words of his co-speaker, Romanian Defense Ministry State Secretary Simona Cojocaru, Hodges said that NATO militaries must be ready to roll out much faster than they currently can. According to the retired general, Western armies were ready for deployment within 24 hours during the Cold War, while today&apos;s militaries largely lack this mindset. NATO should have the &quot;courage to acknowledge what you see as a threat, and then start pulling ammunition out of bunkers, starting deploying troops to be prepared.&quot; Hodges added that allied leaders are often hesitant to respond fast and decisively enough, fearing such steps would be perceived as provocation. Hodges also called for investing in exercises and ammunition production to increase the alliance&apos;s military readiness. &quot;Ten and half years after Russia invaded Ukraine, and we still cannot provide enough ammunition for a week. And we&apos;ve emptied our bunkers to help.&quot; The retired general nevertheless added that European countries are &quot;moving in a much better direction,&quot; namely praising Poland&apos;s planned military transformation.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-oct-2-2/	2024-10-02T12:24:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1785368869.jpg
Ukraine's military intelligence hacks Russian finance industry, source says	Cyber specialists of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) carried out a cyberattack on online platforms of the Russian financial industry on Oct. 2, a military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent. Russian banks Alfa-Bank and Otkritie Bank, as well as Rostelecom, Russia&apos;s largest provider of digital services, were targeted, the source said, adding that these firms &quot;ensured the aggression of the Russian Armed Forces against Ukraine.&quot; The attack caused a &quot;global failure&quot; in the rapid payment system, shutting down banks&apos; mobile applications and online banking systems as well as the financial institutions&apos; internal services, according to the source. Ukrainian hackers have been attacking Russian online platforms on a regular basis since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022. A previous cyberattack on Russian banks was carried out on Sept. 14, targeting Bank Rossiya, Tinkoff Bank, Gaz Bank, and the Quick Payment System (SBP) from Russia&apos;s Central Bank. Between Sept. 23 and 26, cyber specialists of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence attacked over 800 servers in various regions of Russia. In late August, Ukrainian hackers attacked the servers of Russian internet providers and blocked &quot;dozens&quot; of online platforms at industrial facilities in Russia. The attack affected at least 33 servers and 283 office computers at industrial facilities, took down 21 websites, and destroyed 15 cloud and file storage systems. A large-scale cyberattack in late June left at least 250,000 consumers in occupied Crimea and other Russian-controlled territories without communication. The June attack reportedly affected both the networks of consumers and operators that used the impacted infrastructure in Russian-occupied territories. Representatives of Russian providers called it &quot;the most powerful DDoS attack they have ever experienced,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-military-intelligence-attacks-russian-financial-industrys-online-network-source-says/	2024-10-02T12:13:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2076721343.jpg
Putin signs law allowing criminal defendants to join the military	Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law on Oct. 2 that exempts defendants from criminal liability if they join the Russian army, according to Russia&apos;s legal information portal. The Russian government wants to conscript 40% of the nearly 60,000 prisoners who are currently held in pre-trial detention centers, according to the independent Russian news outlet IStories. A source told Istories that about 100 people from each Russian detention center are planned to be sent to the war in Ukraine. There are currently 210 pre-trial detention centers in Russia, so about 20,000 people may be sent to serve, the media outlet said. The law allows military service for defendants whose cases are pending in a court of first instance during mobilization or wartime. Another law signed by Putin allows for the release from criminal liability of defendants who have previously been mobilized or who have signed a contract with the Russian Defense Ministry. According to the newly adopted legislation, criminal proceedings against these people will be suspended, and the preventive measure will be canceled during military service. A similar procedure applies to convicts whose sentences have been issued but not yet finalized, including during an appeal process in a criminal case. The defendants will be fully exempt from criminal liability after receiving a state award or dismissal from military service due to age, health condition, or the end of mobilization. Moscow has been recruiting convicts for its war against Ukraine since summer 2022, first under the auspices of the Wagner mercenary company and then directly under the Russian Defense Ministry. The U.K. Defense Ministry said in March that Russia is likely recruiting a total of around 30,000 people a month to help bolster its war effort. Russia is planning to draft 133,000 Russians between October and January, according to a decree signed by Putin on Sept. 30. Men aged from 18 to 30 will be drafted as part of the regular fall conscription campaign. The fall 2023 conscription included the illegally annexed areas of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-signs-law-allowing-criminal-defendants-to-join-the-military/	2024-10-02T11:54:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172350481.jpg
USAID provides $237 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine, launches Rehab4U initiative	The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has launched the Rehab4U project to help Ukrainians rehabilitate after the war and has allocated an additional $237 million for humanitarian aid to Ukraine with the support of the U.S. State Department. The announcement came on Oct. 2 as USAID chief Samantha Power arrived in Kyiv, marking her third visit to Ukraine since 2020. The $13 million initiative Rehab4U aims to increase access to services and assistive technology and promote the inclusion and participation of persons with disabilities in the communities and the country&apos;s recovery, the USAID statement reads. The project will be implemented across 15 regions in Ukraine to ensure &quot;a nationwide impact.&quot; The additional $237 million in aid is intended to help partners &quot;provide life-saving assistance, including critical winterization preparedness aid ahead of the harsh winter months,&quot; according to USAID. According to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter due to Russia&apos;s attacks targeting the country&apos;s energy infrastructure, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand. This summer, the power shortage was 2.5 GW when Ukrainian cities were already experiencing extended blackouts. The agency said that the allocated assistance also aims to support U.N. partners and non-governmental organizations in providing medical services to the local population, housing and its repair, and restoration of heating and water supply systems, among other needs.	https://kyivindependent.com/usaid-provides-237-million-in-humanitarian-aid-to-ukraine-launches-rehab4u-initiative/	2024-10-02T11:27:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1702431868.jpg
‘Human safari’: Kherson civilians hunted down by Russian drones	Editor&#x2019;s note: Some of the Kherson locals interviewed for this story refused to be identified by last name due to fear for their safety. KHERSON &#x2013; On a warm September evening, Olha Chernyshova&#x2019;s day took a grim turn when she was returning home from work in downtown Kherson. Stepping out of her car, she heard a loud buzz and immediately knew it was not a bumblebee. She rushed towards her home&#x2019;s entrance door. A deafening blast shook the yard. A drone had dropped an explosive on her car. Time froze. Back in the yard, Chernyshova saw shattered glass, plastic, and a small metallic cylinder. Her heart racing, she called the police. A team of sappers soon retrieved an undetonated part of a fragmentation grenade. That same day, other drones targeted nearby cars, injuring three of Chernyshova&#x2019;s neighbors. A week after the terrifying incident, she spoke to the Kyiv Independent near her home, hiding from another drone under a large chestnut tree. &#x201C;Where will we hide once the leaves are gone?&#x201D; she asked. &#x201C;It will be an open season on people. I need to work on more drone safety measures.&#x201D; Kherson resident Olha Chernyshova cleans shattered glass from her car after a Russian drone attack in Kherson, Ukraine, in September 2024. (Zarina Zabrisky/The Kyiv Independent)Russian soldiers use kamikaze drones, typically so-called FPV (first-person view) commercial drones loaded with grenades or other explosives to &quot;hunt&quot; civilians in Kherson Oblast, Ukraine. (Facebook)Owner of a family grocery store in Kherson, the capital of Ukraine&#x2019;s southern region on the Dnipro River, Chernyshova lives in a city that has endured relentless Russian artillery and air strikes since its liberation from occupation in the fall of 2022. Local residents last year endured a massive flood triggered by Russia&#x2019;s blowing up of the Kakhovka dam just north of the city. Now, like other residents, she finds herself dodging Russian kamikaze drone strikes, typically so-called FPV (first-person view) commercial drones loaded with grenades or other explosives. Their use along the front lines of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion to kill infantry and tanks alike has been widespread, changing the future of warfare. But in the ravaged city of Kherson, where Ukraine-controlled territory and Russian forces are separated by the Dnipro River instead of no man&#x2019;s land between trenches in the eastern Donbas region, civilians are being targeted routinely. Terrified locals refer to the new strategy as &#x201C;a human safari.&#x201D; &#x201C;Drones are now flying in groups and attacking everything that moves,&#x201D; said Serhii, a volunteer-turned-taxi driver. &#xA0;&#x201C;Our charity hub had to close because trucks can no longer deliver humanitarian aid. This has not only cut off critical supplies but also crippled local businesses that rely on transportation. It&#x2019;s scary to think what will happen in winter when food and fuel shortages could escalate into a full-blown crisis.&#x201D; As drone attacks intensified, Chernyshova &#x2014; a business owner and mother dedicated to safety &#x2014; was authorized by the Kherson administration to initiate the development of drone security guidelines for the city. Online public information resource Dovidka.info wrote and designed posters based on her recommendations for Kherson and other front-line zones. &#x201C;Drones are a real pain for Kherson. Everyone is a target,&#x201D; said Oleksandr Prokudin, the head of the Kherson Oblast Military Administration. &#x201C;Under attack are people walking, driving, bicycling, going to work or standing by grocery stores.&#x201D; Drone strikes averaged 100 per day in July and August 2024, he said. But as autumn set in, the numbers have spiked dramatically. Ukraine&#x2019;s TSN news program reported that a record high of 330 drone strikes and 224 explosive drops hit the region on Sept. 9 alone. To attack women buying watermelons at city corners and children playing in parks, Russian forces use modified commercial drones. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video showing a Russian FPV drone loaded with grenade or other explosive &quot;hunting&quot; a civilian in Kherson Oblast, Ukraine. (Provided by the author)&#x201C;First, you see a reconnaissance drone like a Mavic,&#x201D; said Svitlana, a doctor living by the river. &#x201C;You can hardly hear it, and it just looks around, sending video to the Russian pilot across the river,&#x201D; she said, referring to the eastern bank of the Dnipro River to the south where Russian forces still control swatches of Kherson Oblast. &#x201C;Then comes an FPV (first-person view) drone, dropping a grenade on you. Or, a Coca-Cola can with explosives. Sometimes, the drone crashes and blows up. A 90-year-old woman was badly injured next door, in her yard,&#x201D; she added. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) teams respond to drone attacks in Kherson every day. &#x201C;Often, as I drive to the location, drones chase my car: they do &#x2018;double taps,&#x2019; striking first responders and sappers,&#x201D; a leading expert in the field told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity citing lack of authority to speak with the media. &#x201C;I fire at them with an AK rifle, but it&#x2019;s difficult because the drones are small and fly at an altitude of 120 meters. Any lower than 30 meters means the drone is in attack mode, so I hide and wait. Once it&#x2019;s gone, I can neutralize an FPV drone or explosives if it hasn&apos;t detonated. If it did, I look through debris and, often, human body parts to figure out the kind of drone and explosives used.&#x201D; The sapper shared a Telegram channel where Russian drone operators post videos of these attacks. &#x201C;They know that the international laws prohibit deliberate attacks on civilians, civilian infrastructure, and humanitarian missions but they believe the anonymity protects them from prosecution,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;They also need to show the results of their work. Russian volunteers fundraise for Mavic and FPV drones because these commercial models lack military certification and aren&#x2019;t supplied by the military.&#x201D; Volodymyr, a former construction business owner, got two concussions as drones dropped explosives on his car four times. He lives in a large house within walking distance of the Dnipro River. He lost his company during the nine months of Russian occupation and survived two years of shelling, bombing, missile attacks, and the Kakhovka dam flood. After two recent artillery attacks, his family left Kherson. L: A part of a Russian drone in an undated photo in Kherson Oblast. (Provided by the author) R: An information poster for civilians on how to protect themselves against Russian drone strikes targeting civilians. (Provided by the author)From his window, Volodymyr can see the Dnipro River that divides Ukrainian-controlled territory from the Russian-occupied left bank. &#x201C;The river is only 800 meters wide here, and a sniper used to shoot at me from the bushes. When our guys pushed the Russians back last fall, they tried to wipe us out with aerial guided bombs but those were too expensive. So now it&#x2019;s all drones,&#x201D; Volodymyr told the Kyiv Independent. Volodymyr helps a group of volunteers, drone enthusiasts, and local engineers work together to develop anti-drone technologies and assist the Ukrainian military in countering drone attacks. Another group member, Oleksandr, an engineer and local drone manufacturer involved in the community&#x2019;s efforts, told the Kyiv Independent that Russian drones can now fly and strike further due to new technology. They are equipped with retransmitters &#x2014; devices that boost, extend, and share signals between reconnaissance and attack drones. According to Oleksandr, drones have likely become the weapon of choice due to effective Ukrainian artillery strikes on Russian positions and ammunition depots, potentially causing a shell shortage. This, combined with some Russian troops being redeployed to the Kharkiv and Kursk fronts, has led to a reliance on drones. &#x201C;Our Ukrainian military has intercepted Russian phone conversations,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;It seems that graduates of Russian drone pilot schools practice on us, using any moving target for training. They kill and injure civilians every day.&#x201D; Angela, a resident of the Shidnyi district, often visits her parents in Antonivka, a town just north of Kherson. There, the main bridge &#x2014; that once connected both sides of the river &#x2013; now stands heavily damaged from years of strikes. Antonivka also faces heavy drone attacks. As Angela waits at a bus stop, drones hover over the street and her heart sinks. She lost Serhii, her husband of 32 years, in early August when shrapnel from a grenade dropped by a drone pierced his heart. By the time she rushed home from work, Serhii had died. She still lives in their apartment, with drones buzzing by her window daily. With her elderly parents and in-laws still in Kherson Oblast, moving is off the table, due to the financial strain and the logistics. Close to Angela&#x2019;s home is the Regional Oncological Health Center. The street in front of it resembles a war movie set, with a minivan abandoned in the middle of the road, its windows broken and doors flung open. A bomb shelter on the corner shows skid marks from an FPV drone that crashed into it. &#x201C;Drones attack our buildings, ambulances, and cars daily. They kill our doctors and patients,&#x201D; said Iryna Sokur, the oncological hospital director. &#x201C;They also target our generators, putting about 100 patients undergoing chemotherapy or surgery at risk.&#x201D; The destroyed building after a Russian drone attack on Zolota Balka village in Kherson Oblast, Ukraine on Sept. 24, 2024. (Kherson Oblast State Administration/Telegram)The destroyed building after a Russian drone attack on Zolota Balka village in Kherson Oblast, Ukraine on Sept. 24, 2024. (Kherson Oblast State Administration/Telegram)Sadove, another suburb of Kherson, already devasted by incessant artillery attacks, began facing drone attacks in early 2024. By August, residents suffered from ten drone strikes daily, said Natalia, a volunteer. &#x201C;One drone destroyed our cell phone tower, so we couldn&#x2019;t call firefighters,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;The water wells failed because the drones destroyed the diesel generators for pumping water. When the drones dropped napalm on roofs and dried-up lawns, firefighters could not respond due to &#x2018;double taps.&#x2019;&#x201D; As fires destroyed more and more houses in Sadove, most residents were forced to leave even though the evacuation from areas like Antonivka and Sadove diminished or stopped as highways were targeted. &#x201C;Everywhere in Kherson, drones drop napalm-filled improvised incendiary devices that explode on impact, causing fires that spread rapidly,&#x201D; said Volodymyr Perepelytsia, head of explosive services for the National Police in Kherson Oblast. &#x201C;They also drop banned PFM-1 anti-personnel mines that look like fallen leaves in parks and streets. If you step on them, you lose a limb.&#x201D; &#xA0; Until June, the coastal areas of Kherson were targeted the most. By September, drones easily reached downtown. Ukrainian forces and local authorities are implementing countermeasures against drone attacks. In September 2024, city officials allocated Hr 8 million ($195,000) to enhance defenses. Since the beginning of the year, over 200 electronic warfare systems have been delivered to troops in Kherson Oblast to strengthen their ability to combat Russian drones. However, the Russian military continually changes frequencies to evade detection by radar and air defense systems, making it challenging for Ukrainian electronic warfare systems to intercept and neutralize them. Russian drone attacks are likely designed to demoralize Ukrainians, leading to two key outcomes: mass evacuations that create &quot;gray zones&quot; along the Dnipro River and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enter peace talks with the Kremlin. Since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion, Kherson&apos;s population has plummeted from about 280,000 to 60,000, with an additional 50 settlements added to the mandatory evacuation order by August 2024. The human toll in Kherson is also mounting. Nearly half of the 547 casualties reported from July 1 to Sept. 9, 2024, were caused by drones, according to a representative from the Kherson military administration who spoke on condition of anonymity citing lack of authority to be interviewed by media. Yet, despite daily attacks, the remaining Kherson residents fix windows with plywood and go on with their lives. &#x201C;Life goes on. At my art studio, we have decided to celebrate the forthcoming Kherson City Day with watermelons this Saturday,&#x201D; said Olena, a medical worker. On Kherson City Day, however, Olena waited for two hours as the drones were hovering over her high rise &#x2013; they never left and she never made it to the party.	https://kyivindependent.com/human-safari-kherson-civilians-hunted-down-by-russian-drones/	2024-10-02T10:07:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-02-at-18_54_06.png
589 civilians killed in Ukraine in summer 2024 by Russia's war, UN reports	At least 589 Ukrainian civilians were killed and another 2,685 injured in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine between June 1 and Aug. 31, according to a report by the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) published on Oct. 1. The number of victims in the summer increased by 45% compared to the OHCHR&apos;s spring monitoring, the report reads. Over the summer, 324 men, 238 women, 14 girls, and 13 boys were killed, while 1,353 men, 1,155 women, 104 boys, and 73 girls were injured. The month of July 2024 was the deadliest for civilians in Ukraine since October 2022, according to the OHCHR. The OHCHR said the main cause of the high number of civilian casualties in July was a large-scale coordinated attack of dozens of missiles launched by Russia at targets across Ukraine on July 8, which killed 44 people and injured 196, as Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service reported. The Russian army&apos;s efforts to establish control over the territory of the eastern Donetsk Oblast also resulted in many civilian casualties, the OHCHR added. At least 10,582 civilians have been killed and nearly 20,000 have been injured since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) said on Feb. 22. The figure of 10,582, which includes 587 children, consists of civilian deaths verified according to UN methodology. The number of dead and injured in fighting immediately after the outbreak of the full-scale war has yet to be fully accounted for, and some of the places that saw the heaviest combat in early 2022 are still under Russian occupation, making it impossible for outside observers to investigate.	https://kyivindependent.com/589-civilians-killed-in-ukraine-in-summer-2024-by-russias-war-un-reports/	2024-10-02T08:44:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2160563483.jpg

Ukrainian Armor to produce 155mm shells using Czechoslovak Group's technology, components	Ukrainian Armor, a private defense enterprise, signed two deals on Oct. 2 with the Czech holding Czechoslovak Group (CSG) to cooperate on the production of 155mm shells, Ukrainian media outlet Militarnyi reported from the DFNC2: International Defense Industries Forum. Since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine has made a wide-reaching shift to NATO standard 155 mm artillery, as Kyiv&apos;s partners had a short supply in stock of Soviet-caliber shells &#x2013; 122 mm and 152 mm. Ukraine has long tried to ramp up domestic ammunition production to become more independent from Western partners. The CSG will supply components and share the technology and manufacturing documentation for the production of the shells to Ukrainian Armor, according to the media outlet. The licensing process will be finalized by the end of the year. And the production is expected to start in early 2025. &quot;We plan to produce and supply about 100,000 rounds of ammunition next year and more than 300,000 in 2026. The process of equipment preparation has already begun,&quot; Ukrainian Armor&apos;s CEO Vladyslav Belbas said. Ammunition will be manufactured in both Ukraine and the Czech Republic, which will increase its production and reduce the costs, Belbas added. The contract includes the production of three types of 155 mm artillery shells. The companies also plan to produce other types of shells and other defense products, such as spare parts for armored vehicles, Militarnyi said. In early March, Bloomberg and Reuters reported that CSG plans to invest &quot;hundreds of millions of euros&quot; in Ukraine to boost its supply of ammunition and equipment. CSG was in talks with state-owned enterprise Ukrainian Defense Industry (UkrOboronProm) on a potential joint venture, billionaire owner Michal Strnad told journalists on March 6. The company has sent around 150 pieces of equipment to Ukraine, funded by other EU or NATO countries, since the start of the full-scale invasion, Strnad told reporters. CSG already produces ammunition, Tatra trucks, and armored vehicles, as well as modernizes Soviet T72 tanks for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-armor-to-produce-155mm-shells-using-czechoslovak-groups-technology-components/	2024-10-02T08:13:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2147867968.jpg
1.5 million Ukrainian children at risk of being deported to Russia, ombudsman says	Around 1.5 million Ukrainian children who remain in occupied areas of Ukraine are at high risk of being deported to Russia, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said on Oct. 2. Russia has already abducted more than 20,000 children since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Lubinets said. Less than 400 of them have been returned home, according to the Children of War database. Deported children have their personal data changed so that their relatives cannot find and bring them back home, the ombudsman added. &quot;Our children are even sent to so-called &apos;re-education camps&apos; where they are zombified with Russian propaganda. Just imagine: our children are forced to deny their Ukrainian origin,&quot; Lubinets said. According to the Ombudsman&apos;s Office, those from children&apos;s homes in Kherson Oblast were first moved to the occupied territories and then deported to Russia. Kyiv also recorded cases of children being illegally adopted by Russian families. &quot;Russia deliberately slows down the process of returning our children,&quot; Lubinets said. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova for their roles in the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children. The unlawful transfer or deportation of civilians to Russia violates the Fourth Geneva Convention and constitutes a war crime under international law.	https://kyivindependent.com/1-5-million-ukrainian-children-at-risk-of-being-deported-by-russia-ombudsman-says/	2024-10-02T06:05:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1752126648.jpg
US company AeroVironment plans to start producing Switchblade loitering munitions in Ukraine	The U.S.-based AeroVironment signed an agreement with a Ukrainian company to localize its production of Switchblade 600 loitering munitions, marking the latest of several recent agreements between Ukrainian and foreign companies to produce weaponry in Ukraine. The Ukrainian company is not being named because of security reasons. The agreement was signed on Oct. 1 during the DFNC2 International Defense Industries Forum in Kyiv, where nearly 300 companies from over 30 countries attended. The Switchblade 600 is a loitering munition used to strike targets by crashing into them. They have a flight range of 40 kilometers or more, and can stay in the air for over 40 minutes. Brett Hush, a senior vice president at AeroVironments who signed the agreement in Kyiv, praised the Switchblade&apos;s performance and added, &quot;with the support and feedback from Ukraine, it&apos;ll be even better.&quot; The Switchblade 600 has been included as part of U.S. assistance packages to Ukraine since 2022. The agreement was one of several signed at the forum to increase joint production between Ukrainian and foreign companies as Ukraine builds its defense capabilities two and a half years into Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The Prague-based Czechoslovak Group signed an agreement for production of several types of heavy artillery ammunition, including 155 shells. The agreement envisions production to start early next year after the required licenses are obtained. &quot;Since the war started, we were able to bring here more than one million pieces of heavy artillery ammunition, and I&apos;m more than sure that thanks to this effort which we recently started, we will be able to double our production capabilities,&quot; said CSG&apos;s Richard Kubena who signed the agreement at the event. U.S.-based D&amp;M Holding Company signed an agreement for joint production of ammunition and specialty chemicals, and Poland&apos;s METALEXPORT signed an agreement for joint production of a strike drone. Also at the forum, French-German defense company KNDS announced it opened an office in Kyiv and plans to produce artillery ammunition in the country. These agreements follow a string of joint production announcements between Ukraine and foreign companies. Among them are German&apos;s defense giant Rheinmetall, Estonia&apos;s Frankenburg Technologies, and Sweden&apos;s Saab. At the forum, President Volodymyr Zelensky highlighted that Ukraine has exponentially increased domestic ammunition production over the past two years and has successfully tested its own ballistic missile. &quot;In the first half of this year alone, Ukraine produced 25 times more artillery and mortar ammunition than in the entire year of 2022,&quot; Zelensky said. According to the president, Ukraine can now produce 4 million drones per year and has already contracted 1.5 million. The country is also producing between 15-20 Bohdana howitzers per month.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-company-aerovironment-plans-to-start-producing-switchblade-loitering-munitions-in-ukraine/	2024-10-02T05:47:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/DFNC2-Panel-Photo.jpg
Number of Ukrainians willing to join Ukrainian Legion in Poland 'too small,' minister says	The number of Ukrainians willing to join the Ukrainian Legion in Poland has been &quot;too small,&quot; Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz told Wirtualna Polska on Oct. 2. The legion was unveiled in July as a volunteer military unit made up of Ukrainian men living in Poland and trained by the Polish Armed Forces. &quot;We are not responsible for recruitment, but the number of people who were supposed to come forward from the Ukrainian side is too small,&quot; the Polish minister said. &quot;Declarations at the beginning were very high, that even one brigade could be formed... several thousand people. However, this did not happen.&quot; The legion was announced as part of the security agreement signed by President Volodymyr Zelensky and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on July 8. Recruitment for the Ukrainian Legion was planned to be conducted by Ukrainian consular offices. The volunteers were expected to be conscripted under Ukraine&apos;s legislation and trained in Poland by the country&apos;s military. &quot;Several thousand&quot; people registered to participate in the legion as of July 11, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said previously. According to Kosiniak-Kamysz, Poland has trained about 20,000 Ukrainian military personnel who are now fighting at the frontline in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/number-of-ukrainians-willing-to-join-ukrainian-legion-in-poland-too-small-minister-says/	2024-10-02T05:06:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2153247705.jpg
Investigation: Shattering secrecy of Putin’s top spy chief	Even for a Russian spy service official, Sergey Korolev stands out as exceptionally secretive. Korolev, the second-in-command at Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB), has hidden the details of his life and identity so well that even the basics like his birth date and appearance are mixed up or appear to have been invented entirely. This secretiveness may be helping him evade international sanctions. The spy chief, whose agency plays a special role in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, is identified inconsistently or incorrectly on numerous international sanctions lists, possibly rendering him at times undetectable to sanctions enforcers. Moreover, the only photo of &#x201C;Korolev&#x201D; that appears in many media reports about him pictures a completely different Russian man. The Kyiv Independent has filled in the gaps in the story of Korolev, stripping Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s second-main spy chief of a significant portion of his long-lived anonymity. The FSB, a successor to the notorious Soviet KGB service, plays a crucial role in Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s regime. The service is known to have been engaged in recruiting pro-Russian agents in other countries, sabotage, cyber operations, espionage, disinformation campaigns, and even poisoning and assassinations. The FSB was also responsible for providing Putin with intelligence prior to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, according to media reports. Following the invasion of Ukraine, Korolev, FSB&apos;s first deputy director and the second most influential figure in the country&apos;s main security agency, was among the Russian officials targeted by international sanctions. The EU sanctions list said Korolev&#x2019;s actions at the FSB &#x201C;threaten Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity and independence.&#x201D; Spanish law enforcement also uncovered significant connections between Korolev and the Russian mafia in the first decade of the 2000s, according to media reports. Despite the high-profile role, Korolev, much like a character from a spy novel, is one of the most mysterious individuals in Russia&#x2019;s special service leadership. His name helps the secrecy. He bears one of the most popular Russian names and a fairly common last name. He is a namesake of the famous Sergey Korolev, the scientist behind the Soviet Union&#x2019;s space race success. Like everyone in Russia, Korolev bears a patronymic. His full name is Sergey Borisovich Korolev. That doesn&#x2019;t help much to pin his true identity down: According to two leaked databases of Russian individuals&#x2019; data, he has nearly two dozen full namesakes in Russia. Moreover, a puzzling error was made in Korolev&#x2019;s identifying information in European sanctions lists. The European Union&#x2019;s and Swiss sanctions lists contain two different dates of his birth &#x2014; both of which seem to be incorrect. It doesn&#x2019;t help that his Russian name has variations of English transliteration: It can be Korolyov or Korolev, and Sergey or Sergei. Official sources use different versions, potentially complicating his identification. (Editor&#x2019;s Note: Throughout this story, we identify him as Sergey Korolev, as we believe this spelling variant most likely matches his passport.) &#xA0; Korolev has never been interviewed by the media and has no known social media accounts. It seems that very few people know what the second-in-command at the FSB actually looks like. When he is mentioned in the media, the accompanying photo is that of another person, as the Kyiv Independent has been able to prove. One will not find Korolev&#x2019;s photo or date of birth on the FSB website. Only a few details from his biography are available there. Korolev was appointed to his current role by Putin in 2021. He holds the high rank of general in the Russian military and has been with Russia&apos;s security services since 1979. These scant details gave a start to our search. The single image used online as the photo for Korolev shows a young-looking man with a buzz cut, wearing a black jacket and tie, similar to the stereotypical image of a secret service officer. This photo has been used hundreds of times to accompany mentions of Korolev online. The real Korolev looks nothing like the man in the picture. However, the fake photo is so prevalent that it was even listed as Korolev&#x2019;s portrait on the website of Rosatom Corporation, a Russian state-owned nuclear holding. Korolev has been sitting on Rosatom&#x2019;s supervisory board since 2017, combining it with his role at FSB. Rosatom added the photo in 2021, when Korolev was appointed deputy head of FSB. Media reports about the appointment massively used the fake photo. It spread across the web and even got into foreign press. Incorrect image falsely used to represent Sergey Korolev of the FSB on Facebook and on a Russian official website. (The Kyiv Independent)Then, the fake photo traveled even further. After Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian National Agency for Corruption Prevention maintained a register of persons sanctioned by Ukraine. This public list included Korolev &#x2013; again, with the same photo showing a different person. But where did the fake photo of Korolev come from in the first place? In some articles, the image is credited to Boris Yarkov. We found him. Yarkov is a photographer, founder, and editor-in-chief of a local news agency Poviestka Dnia in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg. It appears that it was Yarkov&#x2019;s news agency that gave a start to the years-long misidentification of Korolev. In July 2016, Yarkov&apos;s news agency apparently used the photo in question to illustrate the news about Korolev&apos;s appointment to the FSB&apos;s Economic Security Unit. The report didn&#x2019;t indicate that the buzz-cut man in the photo was Korolev. It&#x2019;s a frequent practice for smaller online media to use photos with an illustrative purpose, where the image doesn&#x2019;t necessarily depict the person or event mentioned in the story. Moreover, within the next year, the media outlet removed the photo from its news story. It remained on Yarkov&apos;s personal Facebook page, where we found it. In a conversation with the Kyiv Independent, the photographer Yarkov confirmed that it was not Korolev in the photo, and suggested the person was a security guard. He could not remember the circumstances of taking the photo. We have identified the man who had accidentally and unwillingly lent his appearance to a top FSB official. Image analysis software indicates that the photo most likely represents a Yekaterinburg resident, Artem Kupliennikov, who does not appear to have any connections to Korolev. We called Kupliennikov, pretending to be the communications director of Rosatom. Kuplennikov admitted that it was him in the photo of &#x201C;Korolev.&#x201D; When the photo was taken, he worked at the security service of Yeltsin Center, a cultural complex in Yekaterinburg. The center hosts many public events, and Kupliennikov believes he was photographed during one of them. Kupliennikov claims that he reached out to some media outlets saying it was him in the photo and asking to take it down &#x2014; but the photo nevertheless circulated as the photo of Sergey Korolev. As bizarre as it is, this mistake has helped the real Korolev keep his appearance private. While investigative journalists reporting on Korolev suspected that the man in the widespread photo wasn&#x2019;t him, they had no other images, and all the previous investigative journalism reports about Korolev ran without his photo. Exiled Russian investigative journalists have revealed Korolev&#x2019;s business and criminal connections, but never ran his portrait. Ukrainian intelligence sources have provided the Kyiv Independent with photos that they believe show the real Korolev. Several Ukrainian and foreign media outlets have received and published similar photos, seemingly without verification. We have investigated these images independently, and were able to confirm that the man in the photos is the real Sergey Korolev. The real Sergey Korolev shows up in several photos published on the website of the Russian Anti-Terrorist Committee, an inter-agency assembly headed by FSB Director Alexander Bortnikov. Most of the photos don&#x2019;t have any captions and Korolev is never mentioned in the reports about the committee meetings. But two photos provide a clue: A name sign reading &#x201C;Sergey Borisovich Korolev&#x201D; is in the frame. Sergey Korolev on the website of the Russian Anti-Terrorist Committee, headed by the FSB, in 2019. (The Kyiv Independent)Sergey Korolev on the website of the Russian Anti-Terrorist Committee, headed by the FSB, in 2017. (The Kyiv Independent)The second source to confirm Korolev&apos;s appearance was an account on the Russian social media platform Odnoklassniki (Russian for &#x201C;Classmates&#x201D;). The account is dedicated to archiving Russian border guards&#x2019; history. It appears that the account is run by a former classmate of Sergey Korolev from the FSB Border Institute &#x2014; formerly, a KGB School. The page has been active for at least five years and contains more than a thousand photographs, mostly of Russian security forces involved in the border service at various times. Korolev &#x2014; the same man seen in the photos with the FSB director &#x2014; can be spotted in many of them. Archive photo of Sergey Korolev from a Russian Odnoklassniki social media account. The photo is most likely taken in 2003. (The Kyiv Independent)Several photos show a gathering of FSB Border Institute alumni, dated June 2003, apparently taking place on the occasion of the 20-year anniversary of their graduation. Korolev is seen in two photos from the gathering: a large group photo, and a smaller photo of nine men, added to an album called &#x201C;Classmates who are now generals.&#x201D; The account published the photos long after they were taken, in 2019 and in 2023. In the comments, the account owner and alleged classmate of Korolev described the career path of the men in the photos. Korolev, he wrote, started in the border guard service and rose to head the FSB economic security department. Archive photo of Sergey Korolev from a Russian Odnoklassniki social media account. The photo is most likely taken in 2003. (The Kyiv Independent)The account also has photos of young Korolev as a cadet in the FSB Border Institute, in an album entitled &#x201C;Studies at the Border Guard School (1979-1983).&#x201D; The year matches Korolev&#x2019;s official date of joining Russia&#x2019;s security services &#x2014; as a cadet, he&#x2019;d count as a member of the force starting his first year of studies.

(The Kyiv Independent)The former classmate isn&#x2019;t the only source of Korolev&#x2019;s imagery online. For all his secretiveness, the deputy head of FSB has left some more traces. Korolev was photographed alongside former Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov. During Serdyukov&#x2019;s tenure as minister, Sergey Korolev served as his adviser. Former Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov is talking at an event in 2019. Sergey Korolev is spotted attending the event. (The Kyiv Independent)At least once, Korolev did something atypical for a top spy agency official: In 2020, he showed up at the recording of a popular Russian TV comedy show, KVN. The man who was months away from being appointed deputy head of FSB sat in one of the first rows, where he would certainly be caught on camera. The filming took place in Yalta, Crimea, a Ukrainian city that has been under Russian occupation since 2014. The TV version of the show can still be found on YouTube and has over a million views, with Korolev shown throughout the recording multiple times. Perhaps Korolev was convinced that years of secretiveness granted him enough anonymity that he could attend a popular show incognito, sit in the second row, right behind the jury, be filmed from every possible angle, and shown on Russia&#x2019;s state TV. A photo report from the filming, published in a local newspaper, also captures Korolev, but doesn&#x2019;t identify him. Korolev didn&#x2019;t attend alone: It was a family outing. We identified the people around Korolev: Sitting next to him are his wife Marina, son Boris, and daughter Anastasia. We matched them with other images we found on the web. Sergey Korolev with his wife Marina, daughter Anastasia, and son Boris at a Russian televised comedy show KVN in 2020, in Russian occupied Yalta, Crimea. (Media Yalta)The mystery of the birth dateKorolev is subject to sanctions imposed by the EU, Switzerland, the U.K., Canada, the U.S., New Zealand, Australia, and Ukraine as a result of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. These sanctions restrict his access to assets in these countries, limit financial operations, and, in some of them, impose a travel ban. The sanctions were imposed in 2022 and 2023. For the sanctions to work efficiently and for the authorized bodies to be able to identify the exact Sergey Korolev and his assets, his date of birth is an important detail. Up until the sanctions were imposed, there seemed to be no confusion about Korolev&#x2019;s date of birth: It was listed as July 25, 1962. This date of birth was on Wikipedia pages about Korolev, both in English and Russian, where notably, there was no photo. This is the only date of birth mentioned by Russian investigative journalists reporting on Korolev and his alleged links to Russian criminals in a story published in 2021. Thus, at the time of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the subsequent imposition of sanctions on Korolev, his date of birth was not a secret and was not questioned. But then, something went wrong. In 2022, the EU and Swiss sanctions lists offered two possible birth dates for Sergey Korolev, both a decade earlier than the real one: July 25, 1952 and Nov. 9, 1952. We couldn&#x2019;t find any obvious explanation for why these birth dates were listed. Equally interesting is why Korolev&apos;s publicly known date of birth wasn&apos;t included in the EU and Swiss sanctions lists even as one of the options. We were able to verify that Korolev&apos;s actual date of birth is July 25, 1962. This date is listed in his registration documents in a St. Petersburg apartment, where his daughter Anastasia is also registered, according to leaked Russian databases. This date is also mentioned in the Odnoklassniki account presumably run by Korolev&apos;s former classmate. &#x201C;Second row, second from left &#x2014; Korolev Sergey Borisovich. On July 25, 2022, Sergey celebrated his 60th birthday,&#x201D; the account owner wrote, commenting on one of the photos. The European Union and Switzerland allegedly made a mistake in Sergey Korolev&apos;s date of birth while adding him to their sanctions lists. (Karolina Gulshani / The Kyiv Independent)Several countries have also identified Korolev&apos;s date of birth as July 25, 1962 in their sanctions lists: the UK in April 2022, Australia in May 2022, Ukraine in October 2022, New Zealand in November 2022, and the US in July 2023. Canada has also listed 1962 as his year of birth without mentioning a specific date in its sanctions in March 2022. The wrong date is listed only in the EU and Swiss sanctions. The Kyiv Independent sent inquiries to the European Commission, the EU Council representatives and Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), asking how the mistake occurred, what consequences it could have had, and whether any assets belonging to Korolev in the EU or Switzerland had been identified. In a written response, the EU Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Peter Stano said that he had &#x201C;no information about difficulties in implementing the sanctions&#x201D; against Korolev in the EU member states. &#x201C;The date of birth is only one of the identifiers,&#x201D; he said, without specifying what other identifiers in the EU sanctions list could help banks and other institutions identify the correct Sergey Korolev. He also did not explain how the incorrect birth date of 1952 got into the sanctions adopted by the EU Council, saying the Council has &#x201C;every relevant information at its disposal to identify precisely the individual or the entity to be added to the list of those subject to sanctions.&#x201D; The SECO spokesperson responded that the Swiss list of sanctions against Russia is identical to the EU list. &#x201C;Deviations are being examined,&#x201D; Francoise Tschanz, spokesperson for SECO, told the Kyiv Indepedendent, adding that SECO does not comment on individual cases. To make matters worse, Korolev and his family appear to have used fictitious names. According to the leaked Russian databases, Sergey Korolev and his family were registered at the same address in St. Petersburg with fictitious names. The surname, patronymics, dates of birth, and passport numbers were real &#x2014; which we confirmed via the Russian Tax Service database &#x2014; but the first names were altered. In the database, Sergey Korolev became Nikolai, his son Boris became Vadim, and his daughter Anastasia became Veronika. A Russian investigative journalist previously claimed Korolev&apos;s son was listed in official documents under the fake name Gennady Streltsov. Another potential obstacle for Korolev&#x2019;s identification in the sanctions list is the inconsistent transliteration of his name. &#x201C;Sergey Korolev&#x201D; is likely the spelling used in Korolev&#x2019;s passport. It&#x2019;s the only spelling that shows up in a leaked database of Russian individuals&apos; data. &#x201C;Korolev&#x201D; is also the transliteration used by the official&#x2019;s children when registering emails and social media. However, only the Australian and U.S. sanctions notices use this spelling for all parts of his name. The others spell his name as &#x201C;Sergei&#x201D; or surname as &#x201C;Korolyov.&#x201D; This spelling used to be listed as one form of his name on the U.K. sanctions, but in March 2023, it was removed. The removal was explained as eliminating a duplicate entry. As a result, only Sergei Borisovich Korolyov remains on the U.K. sanctions list. &#xA0; The EU and Swiss sanction lists went further, adding an extra letter &quot;s&#x201D; to his patronymic: Sergei Borissovich Korolev, in accordance with the French transliteration. The errors in sanctions&#x2019; lists &#x2014; the wrong birth date and wrong transliteration &#x2014; could complicate identifying Korolev as a sanctioned FSB official for border authorities, banks, and other institutions. &#x201C;This leaves wiggle room. The sanction remains, but some banks, for example, might not recognize this person as sanctioned, especially if there is no other identifying data,&#x201D; explains Vladyslav Vlasiuk, Ukraine&#x2019;s presidential commissioner for sanctions policy. This means that the FSB&apos;s first deputy director may have been able to circumvent restrictions in some European countries. Why did European sanctions lists include incorrect birth dates for a high-ranking FSB official? On the one hand, the scarce information about one of the FSB&apos;s leaders raises the possibility of human error in identifying this non-public figure by foreign authorities. Vlasiuk, Ukraine&apos;s presidential commissioner for sanctions policy, attributes it to a simple mistake. However, Korolev&apos;s actual birth date has been widely available, including in reports by investigative journalists, several official sanctions lists, and leaked data from Russia&apos;s databases. Given the abundance of public records mentioning Korolev&apos;s correct birthdate, it&apos;s surprising that only incorrect versions appeared in the EU and Swiss sanctions lists. Whether Korolev holds any accounts, real estate, or other assets in Europe remains uncertain. What is clear is that he and his family lead a wealthy lifestyle often linked to European countries. Korolev may be an important cog in the Russian regime&#x2019;s war machine against the West and all it stands for, but the senior FSB official seems to be a believer in Western education. For years, he sent his children to take courses in pricy schools in the U.K. and Switzerland &#x2014; they can be seen in the photos published by these schools. Both of Korolev&#x2019;s children have attended summer English courses, known as the Pilgrims Course, taking place at the prestigious Harrow School in London. Photos of Anastasia Koroleva attending the course in 2014 can still be found on the school&apos;s website. Judging by the site, these are summer English courses lasting from two to six weeks. The current tuition for the course varies from 5,000 to 15,000 pounds, depending on the duration. Photos of Sergey Korolev&#x2019;s daughter Anastasia Koroleva at the Harrow School in London.

(pilgrims.co.uk)Korolev&apos;s daughter can also be seen in the 2016 and 2018 photo reports of the summer programs at the American Tassis School in Switzerland. The current price of a summer program is 8,000 Swiss francs, or $9,420. Photos of Sergey Korolev&#x2019;s daughter Anastasia Koroleva during her study at the American Tassis School in Switzerland. (tasis.smugmug.com)Korolev&#x2019;s family enjoys a wealthy lifestyle in Russia, as well. The family appears to have a range of real estate and luxury cars. In a manner typical for officials, most of it is registered in family and associates&#x2019; names. Korolev used to work at FSB in St. Petersburg, and the official has maintained connections to the city. Korolev&#x2019;s wife Marina is registered at a house in Sestroretsk, a suburb of St. Petersburg. Korolev and his daughter are registered at an apartment in St. Petersburg. While registration doesn&#x2019;t prove ownership, it usually points to a link to this property. &#xA0; Other real estate connected to Korolev&#x2019;s family is in Moscow, his current place of work. His son Boris is registered in an elite apartment in central Moscow, with an area of 200 square meters. The official owner of the apartment is Maria Koroleva, according to a BBC Russian service report. The woman appears to be Sergey Korolev&#x2019;s niece. Additionally, a large plot in the Lesnaya Bukhta housing development near Moscow was registered in the name of Korolev&apos;s son, according to previous reports. Can Korolev&#x2019;s salary at FSB pay for this lifestyle? He has never filed a public declaration, and his salary hasn&#x2019;t been made public. His predecessor was reportedly making around $180,000 a year in 2019. Yet salary may not be the only source of income &#x2014; there are traces of the family&#x2019;s business interests. In the St. Petersburg suburb, a short drive away from Korolev&#x2019;s wife&#x2019;s house, there is a spa hotel Voda. According to the Russian real estate register, the hotel&#x2019;s building is owned by Shalash, a Russian company. Shalash has several owners, one of them Korolev&#x2019;s sister Tetyana Koroleva. Another co-owner is a British company, Steelcore Alliance LLP. Its beneficiary is an Uzbek citizen, Aybek Buribekov. Another company allegedly connected to Korolev&#x2019;s family is Citadel LLC, Russia&#x2019;s largest manufacturer of wiretapping equipment, mandatory for the Russian mobile operators to install. Its founders are classified in the Russian company registry. Independent Russian investigative journalists from iStories have claimed that Citadel is linked to Korolev through his alleged confidant Valery Bitaev, who co-owns the company. Incidentally, Citadel depends on FSB licensing. According to the BBC&#x2019;s Russian Service, Citadel invested in Korolev&#x2019;s son Boris Korolev&#x2019;s business venture &#x2014; a tech company called Bastion. Like with Citadel, the company owners are classified in the registry. Korolev&#x2019;s son&#x2019;s company Bastion is noteworthy by itself. Founded in 2018, the company claims to specialize in ethical hacking &#x2014; testing the vulnerabilities of other companies&apos; information systems. In the past few years, reports have surged of Russian state hackers targeting people and entities in Ukraine and Western countries. Many reports directly mention the agency behind it: It&#x2019;s FSB. Note from the author: Hello, this is Alisa Yurchenko, the author of this story. Thank you for reading my first investigation for the Kyiv Independent. I joined the team recently, but I have been working in investigative journalism for over 10 years. I spent the last 1.5 months studying social media, photos from FSB-related events, and hacked Russian databases &#x2014; all of it to end the long-cherished secretiveness of the top official of the Russian FSB, the security service that plays a crucial role in the Russian war. This story proves that even the FSB deputy director who&#x2019;s been hiding his appearance for decades can leave unexpected traces online. All we need is the desire and the skills to find them. I love OSINT, and there will be more investigations in the Kyiv Independent.

Opinion: We're Republicans, and we're voting for Kamala Harris to back Ukraine	In the past week, both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Polish President Andrzej Duda made stops in Pennsylvania. Zelensky toured an ammunition factory in Scranton, while Duda attended the unveiling of a statue at the Czestochowa cemetery commemorating the Polish Solidarity movement and its fight for independence against the Soviet-backed communist regime. Both leaders were en route to the United Nations General Assembly and share deep concerns about whether the United States will continue to lead NATO&#x2019;s defense of Eastern Europe against the threat posed by Russia&#x2019;s Vladimir Putin. The outcome of the upcoming presidential election will likely determine Washington&#x2019;s role, making it crucial for Pennsylvania&#x2019;s 750,000 Polish residents and 122,000 Ukrainians to engage in the electoral process. During the presidential debate on Sept. 12, Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump declined to say whether he wants Ukraine to win the war. He has never criticized Putin for his invasion and the brutal bombing campaigns that have killed tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians. Instead, Trump blames Zelensky for the war and has threatened to cut off aid to Ukraine. His chosen running mate, J.D. Vance, has suggested that Ukraine must concede territory to negotiate with Russia. By ignoring Russia&apos;s ongoing aggression in Ukraine and its implications for U.S. national interests and the security of European allies, Trump has aligned himself more closely with strongman Putin than with longstanding U.S. commitments to peace, democracy, and fundamental freedoms. As president, Trump did little to materially assist Ukraine and even attempted to extort the country to bolster his 2020 re-election campaign. His 2020 Republican campaign was notably silent on both Russia and Ukraine, enabling him to promote a more isolationist and ill-conceived &quot;America First&quot; vision. Vance is a staunch opponent of military and economic aid to Ukraine. Earlier this year, he publicly opposed legislation aimed at seizing Russian sovereign assets in the U.S. to aid Ukraine and shield American taxpayers from the immense damage caused by Russia. As a former U.S. Treasury Department official during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, and as a Republican congressman who represented Pennsylvania for 12 years, we believe that seizing Russian overseas assets to help Ukraine would have been a priority for both former Republican presidents. Vance, however, thinks otherwise. Historically, Trump has opposed the continued existence of NATO, the cornerstone of U.S. and European security since the Cold War. On the same day that NATO convened in Washington this year, a Russian cruise missile destroyed the Okhmatdyt children&#x2019;s hospital in Kyiv, prompting Trump to reiterate that he would not necessarily defend a NATO ally under Russian attack. Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump attends an event in Kittanning, Pennsylvania, United States, on Sept. 23, 2024. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)His authoritarian stance has effectively given Putin the green light to act with impunity in Europe against NATO members. While U.S. President Joe Biden recently met with Zelensky, Trump welcomed Hungary&#x2019;s authoritarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to Mar-a-Lago. In stark contrast to Trump&#x2019;s policies, the Biden-Harris administration acted swiftly to mobilize NATO to support Ukraine following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Vice President Kamala Harris met with Zelensky five days beforehand to warn him of the impending threat. After the invasion, the White House imposed strong economic sanctions against Russia, including freezing Russian assets held abroad. In April, Biden signed legislation that Vance opposed, which aimed to seize those assets to assist Ukraine and protect American taxpayers. During the presidential debate, Harris pledged her unwavering support for Ukraine&apos;s &quot;righteous defense,&quot; while Trump repeatedly dodged direct questions from ABC&#x2019;s David Muir regarding his stance on Ukraine&apos;s victory over Russia. The contrast between Trump and Harris on Ukraine and Poland could not be starker. A Trump administration would continue favoring Russia over Ukraine and fail to hold Russia accountable for the devastation it inflicts on innocent civilians. Meanwhile, Harris will maintain her support for Ukraine&#x2019;s courageous fight to preserve its sovereignty and democracy, advocating for just reparations once Russia&#x2019;s illegal aggression ceases. She will also ensure that the U.S. remains a steadfast ally and protector of Poland. To the extent voters consider vital U.S. foreign policy and national security issues important this November, the only option is clear. A vote for Harris and her running mate Tim Walz is a vote for America&#x2019;s and Ukraine&#x2019;s interests in Europe, while a vote for Trump and Vance favors Russia and enables Putin&#x2019;s ongoing war of aggression.

Ukraine aims to increase ballistic missiles, long-range arms production in 2025, Umerov says	Ukraine is planning to increase its own production of drones, long-range and ballistic missiles in 2025, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Oct. 1 at Ukraine&apos;s second international defense industry forum. Ukraine began actively developing its missile program after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. In late July, President Volodymyr Zelensky said the program had &quot;good dynamics.&quot; He then announced in August that Ukraine had carried out a successful test of its first domestically-made ballistic missile. According to Umerov, $4 billion has been already invested in the development of Ukrainian industry. &quot;Next year we plan to increase funding. Our priority is to develop domestic drones and long-range weapons, including ballistic missiles,&quot; the minister added. Speaking at the Forum, Umerov said that Kyiv also wants to unveil more details about a major Ukrainian missile program later this year or in 2025, Interfax-Ukraine reported. In addition, the defense ministry aims to attract foreign partners to create joint ventures to develop the defense industry. &quot;An important part of this cooperation is the signing of long-term contracts for the production, supply and maintenance of weapons to ensure that the Ukrainian army is supplied for the long term,&quot; a statement from the ministry read. Domestically produced long-range weapons are of key importance to Ukraine&apos;s defense strategy, as Western partners refuse to authorize deep strikes in Russia with foreign-made missiles. Despite Zelensky&apos;s appeal to Washington during his recent White House visit, the U.S. has not yet altered its policy on long-range strikes.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-aims-to-increase-ballistic-missiles-long-range-arms-production-in-2025-umerov-says/	2024-10-02T04:19:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2169444679.jpg
Ukrainian forces withdraw from Vuhledar, military announces	Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from the town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, the Khortytsia group of forces said on Oct. 2. &quot;The higher command authorized a manoeuvre to withdraw units from Vuhledar in order to save personnel and military equipment, and take up a position for further operations,&quot; it said in a statement. Ukraine&apos;s 72nd Mechanized Brigade has defended Vuhledar, key to Ukrainian defenses in the southern part of Donetsk Oblast, for nearly two years. Russian forces have been attempting to capture the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Vuhledar withstood numerous attacks in recent weeks as Russian forces attempted to encircle the town. Local authorities confirmed that Russian troops entered Vuhledar on Oct. 1, adding that fighting was ongoing. The front-line town lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Vuhledar is located north of a key intersection connecting the O-0532 road towards Vodiane and Kostiantynivka, a small paved road toward Kurakhove, and the partly occupied T-0509 highway toward Velyka Novosilka. &quot;It is, therefore, a key logistic point for Ukrainian forces defending the southern flank of Kurakhove,&quot; Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent last month. Vuhledar is also the last fortified town before the village of Velyka Novosilka and the entire southern part of Donetsk Oblast that Ukraine controls. The occupied section of the T-0509 highway, which passes south of Vuhledar, is essential for Russian forces trying to advance westward.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-forces-withdraw-from-vuhledar/	2024-10-02T02:51:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1767720342.jpg
NATO 'inadequately' prepared for large-scale war with Russia, Hodges says	NATO lacks adequate air defenses, military mobility, ammunition, and the mindset to be fully ready for a large-scale conventional war, retired U.S. Lieutenant General Ben Hodges said on Oct. 2. Speaking at a discussion at the Warsaw Security Forum attended by the Kyiv Independent, Hodges said that many of Europe&apos;s political and military leaders do not fully acknowledge the realities of a possible war with Russia. Warnings about a clash between Russia and NATO have mounted since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with many observers pointing out insufficient defense-industrial base and battle readiness on the West&apos;s part. &quot;We don&apos;t have adequate missile and air defense to protect our seaports, airports, and critical infrastructure,&quot; Hodges said. NATO&apos;s eastern flank has only 5% of the air defense capabilities necessary to deter an attack, the Financial Times reported in May. &quot;We still... cannot move quickly throughout Europe, so the issue of military mobility is still a challenge that needs to be resolved,&quot; the retired general added. If Russia decided to attack NATO, its forces would immediately strike European transport infrastructure that the allies need to respond, the retired general commented. &quot;So imagine a week of what&apos;s happening in Ukraine to happen in Gdansk, or Klaipeda, or Tallinn, or Bremerhaven,&quot; Hodges noted. In the worst-case scenario, Lithuania would have to wait for two weeks for the arrival of reinforcements, the retired officer added. Echoing the words of his co-speaker, Romanian Defense Ministry State Secretary Simona Cojocaru, Hodges said that NATO militaries must be ready to roll out much faster than they currently can. According to the retired general, Western armies were ready for deployment within 24 hours during the Cold War, while today&apos;s militaries largely lack this mindset. NATO should have the &quot;courage to acknowledge what you see as a threat, and then start pulling ammunition out of bunkers, starting deploying troops to be prepared, and then you can be ready to go in two or three days where the risk this.&quot; Hodges added that allied leaders are often hesitant to respond fast and decisively enough, fearing such steps would be perceived as provocation. Hodges also called for investing in exercises and ammunition production to increase the alliance&apos;s military readiness. &quot;Ten and half years after Russia invaded Ukraine, and we still cannot provide enough ammunition for a week. And we&apos;ve emptied our bunkers to help.&quot; The retired general nevertheless added that European countries are &quot;moving in a much better direction,&quot; namely praising Poland&apos;s planned military transformation.	https://kyivindependent.com/hodges-russia-nato/	2024-10-02T02:50:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Hodges.jpg
Ukraine's defense procurement agencies should be kept separate, NATO reaffirms	Two Ukrainian defense procurement agencies should continue to operate separately at least during wartime, the NATO representation to Ukraine said on Oct. 1, after Kyiv&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said they could be merged. The NATO statement came days after Umerov said the ministry was planning to merge the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) and the State Rear Operator (DOT) into one agency. The defense procurement sector was reshaped in December 2023, aiming to meet NATO standards. The DPA, first established in August 2022, was to focus solely on lethal aid. Meanwhile, the DOT was formed to purchase non-lethal aid such as food and clothing. Ukraine and NATO approved a number of recommendations for the Strategic Defense Procurement Review (SDPR) at the Washington summit in July. They said the two agencies should be kept separate &quot;to perform their tasks and supporting their independence and anti-corruption policies,&quot; including through the swift appointment of an independent supervisory board for each agency. Despite this, in an interview with Lb.ua media outlet published on Sept. 24, Umerov said the unification of the agencies was in its final stages. &quot;Our strategy is to hold a strategic session and unite all the agencies into one, according to NATO standards. Some kind of Ukrainian Defense Forces Agency, which will have procurement, logistics, measurement contracts, efficiency, in accordance with NATO,&quot; the minister said. But on Oct. 1 Umerov announced that seperate supervisory boards are to be set up for the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) and the State Rear Operator (DOT) &quot;in the near future.&quot; &quot;Following Defense Minister Umerov&#x2019;s statement today, we affirm our understanding that the two agencies will be kept separate, and welcome the stated intention to appoint the two supervisory boards very soon,&quot; the NATO representation said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-defense-procurement-agencies-should-be-kept-separately-nato-reaffirms/	2024-10-02T01:53:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/umerov.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 7, injure 50 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed seven people and injured 50 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Oct. 2. Ukrainian forces downed 11 out of 32 Shahed-type drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Ten more drones were &quot;lost&quot; due to electronic warfare and four others flew back towards Russia, it added. Russian drones attacked port and border infrastructure near the town of Izmail in southern Odesa Oblast, injuring two truck drivers, Governor Oleh Kiper said. One of the victims is a citizen of Turkey. According to authorities, Russia targeted an international ferry crossing point across the Ukrainian-Romanian state border. The work of the Orlivka crossing point was temporarily suspended, Kiper said. A Russian attack on Odesa Oblast damaged an international ferry crossing point across the Ukrainian-Romanian state border overnight on Oct. 2, 2024. (Oleh Kiper/Telegram)In Kharkiv Oblast, five people, including a 14-year-old boy, were injured in a Russian guided aerial bomb attack on the town of Derhachi, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Russian forces also attacked the town of Kupiansk, injuring a man and a woman. One person was killed and 25 suffered injuries in the city of Zaporizhzhia, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. Russia launched at least six guided aerial bombs against Zaporizhzhia, damaging apartment buildings and houses. Among the wounded were three children aged nine, 10, and 12. Five people were injured in the villages of Chernihivka and Dovha Balka as well as in the town of Sloviansk in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. A market and a public transport stop came under Russian attack in the city of Kherson. Six people were killed and six others injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Five more people suffered injuries after Russian attacks on other settlements in Kherson Oblast over the past day.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-injure-over-past-day-2/	2024-10-02T01:08:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-02_09-26-37.jpg
Don't panic' — Russia to test emergency warning systems across the country	Russia announced it will test its emergency warning systems on Oct. 2, with the government telling citizens &quot;don&apos;t panic, be calm.&quot; At 10:30 a.m. local time, sirens will sound for one minute accompanied by loudspeakers calling &quot;Attention everyone!&quot; and emergency broadcasts on TV and radio. The initiative is a twice-yearly occurrence first introduced in 2020, but which has taken on extra significance since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Sirens now sound for real in parts of the country and occupied Ukrainian territories due to Ukrainian drone and missile strikes. Meanwhile in Ukraine, air raid alerts are a daily occurrence in many parts of the country. More than 40,000 air raid sirens lasting from minutes to hours throughout the day and night have sounded across Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale war over two years ago, according to official reports. In cities heavily-targeted by Russian forces such as Kharkiv, alerts can sound multiple times a day, and last for hours at a time At the end of July, Kharkiv broke the record for having the longest air raid siren since the start of the full-scale invasion. It lasted for nearly two days, starting at around 6:31 p.m. on July 23 and ending at around 9:02 p.m. on July 25.	https://kyivindependent.com/dont-panic-russia-to-test-emergency-warning-systems-across-the-country/	2024-10-01T23:47:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1236042896.jpg

US VP debate passes with no questions, comments about Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine	The U.S. vice presidential debate on Oct. 1 between Republican Senator J.D. Vance and Democratic Governor Tim Walz touched on a variety of domestic issues, and some foreign policy, but did not include a single question &#x2014; or comments from either candidate &#x2014; on Russia&apos;s full-scale war on Ukraine. Vance, who was selected as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump&apos;s running mate in July, has been outspoken about his opposition to U.S. aid for Ukraine. He has repeatedly said that he &quot;doesn&apos;t care about Ukraine,&quot; including just days after the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. There was speculation that the debate could be an opportunity for Walz to hammer Vance on his isolationist views and his recent controversial comments about a proposed peace plan in Ukraine. In September, Vance said in an interview that Trump&apos;s potential plan to end the war could include the establishment of a special demilitarized zone between Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine would retain its sovereignty, but at the same time it would have to give guarantees to Russia that it would not join NATO or any other allied institutions, Vance added. Later in the month, President Volodymyr Zelensky characterized Vance&apos;s views on the war as being &quot;too radical&quot; and said that he did not &quot;consider this concept of his, a plan, in any formal sense.&quot; Alexander Vindman, the former director for European Affairs for the U.S. National Security Council, told the Kyiv Independent ahead of the debate that the showdown was &quot;important&quot; because it would allow Walz to &quot;punch holes into Vance&apos;s worldview.&quot; But besides the first question, which was focused on the ongoing multifaceted conflict in the Middle East, the moderators instead opted to ask questions about abortion, the economy, childcare, and other pocketbook issues. Ukraine was not mentioned at all, and Russia was referenced only once &#x2014; in a passing comment from Vance about Russian interference into the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In the debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in September, Ukraine was the focus of one of the main foreign policy debates. Harris hit Trump on his repeated pledge that he would end the war in 24 hours and accused the former president of planning to &quot;give up&quot; Ukraine. &quot;That&apos;s not who we are as Americans,&quot; Harris added. With the apparent gap between the policies on Ukraine between the two tickets, commentators on CNN were puzzled that Vance and Walz were not asked any questions about the largest land war in Europe since World War II.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-vp-debate-passes-with-no-questions-comments-about-russias-full-scale-war-on-ukraine/	2024-10-01T20:18:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175342835.jpg
US sanctions Russia-based cybercrime group 'Evil Corp'	The U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions on Oct. 1 against seven individuals and two entities associated with Evil Corp, a Russia-based cybercrime group. The Treasury&apos;s sanctions coincided with an indictment from the U.S. Justice Department against an Evil Corp member, as well as additional measures from the U.K. and Australia. According to State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, Evil Corp is &quot;responsible for the development and distribution of the Dridex malware.&quot; &quot;Evil Corp has used the Dridex malware to infect computers and harvest login credentials from hundreds of banks and other financial institutions in over 40 countries, resulting in more than $100 million in theft losses and damage suffered by U.S. and international financial institutions and their customers,&quot; Miller added. Evil Corp&apos;s leader and founder, Maksim Yakubets, was first sanctioned by the Treasury&apos;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in 2019. At the same time, the Justice Department indicted Yakubets and another Evil Corp member and issued a $5 million reward for information leading to their capture and subsequent conviction. &quot;Today&apos;s trilateral action underscores our collective commitment to safeguard against cybercriminals like ransomware actors, who seek to undermine our critical infrastructure and threaten our citizens,&quot; said Treasury official Bradley Smith. In its statement, the Treasury noted that Yakubets and other Evil Corp members have links to Russian politicians and other government figures. Yakubets is also employed at the Russian National Engineering Corporation (NIK), which the Treasury said he uses as a &quot;cover for his ongoing criminal activities linked to Evil Corp.&quot; The U.K.&apos;s National Crime Agency further said that one of the newly sanctioned Evil Corp members, Eduard Benderskiy, a former member of Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB), &quot;used his extensive influence with the Russian state to protect the group.&quot; Prior to 2019, Russian intelligence &quot;tasked Evil Corp to conduct cyber attacks and espionage operations against NATO allies,&quot; the U.K. said.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-sanctions-russia-based-cybercrime-group-evil-corp/	2024-10-01T18:02:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1186593483.jpg
Russia desperate to recruit workers at defense plants amid personnel shortage, BBC reports	Russian defense production facilities are recruiting tens of thousands of factory workers amid an acute personnel shortage, the BBC&apos;s Russian service reported on Oct. 1. The full-scale invasion of Ukraine has drained Russia&apos;s labor market and prompted fierce competition between the military and business for new recruits. At the same time, Russia&apos;s all-out war has dramatically increased the production of weapons and military equipment. Russia has posted thousands of job ads for shift workers at defense enterprises, enticing workers with triple the standard pay, recruiting young people, and offering rewards for referrals of new hires, the BBC&apos;s investigation found. More than 90,000 vacancies for defense industry jobs appeared on Russian job portals between Aug. 15 and Sept. 15, the BBC reported. Salaries for high-demand specialties were often three to four times higher than the average regional salary. Russia faces a shortage of engineers, turners, and CNC machine operators. The Russian job portal Avito in September received 2,000 resumes for turners, in comparison to 60,000 position openings. For CNC operators, there were only 600 resumes for 18,600 vacancies, despite the alluring salaries. At Kurganmashzavod, a plant that produces infantry fighting vehicles in Russia&apos;s Kurgan Oblast, there were 78 open slots for machine tool adjusters and CNC operatiors as of Sept. 4, the investigation found. The shortage of defense facility workers corresponds to Russia&apos;s overall labor shortage, exacerbated by military mobilization and the decreasing number of migrants entering the country. Russia also faces a population crisis, with an expected decline of around 7 million over the next two decades. In addition to offering higher salaries, factories have enticed workers by providing temporary housing to employees recruited from other regions. The Tatarstan Republic reportedly implemented a program in spring 2024 to employ minors aged 14-18 in the defense industry. A draft amendment to the legislation on alternative service submitted to Russia&apos;s State Duma in June 2024 proposed letting new conscripts choose defense industry work as an alternate to military service. Shift work in Russian defense industry plants is often brutal, the BBC reported. Some positions advertised 11-hour shifts with no days off. When a BBC correspondent phoned a company to clarify the details about the length of a shift, the recruiter refused to provide the information, but immediately offered to hire the reporter.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-desperate-to-recruit-workers-at-defense-plants-amid-personnel-shortage-bbc-reports/	2024-10-01T16:26:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1246325284.jpg
Ukraine evacuates 179 people from Lebanon	Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) and Foreign Ministry evacuated 179 people from Lebanon on Oct. 1 amid escalating violence in the Middle East, the Foreign Ministry reported. The evacuation comes after Israel on Oct. 1 launched a ground invasion of southern Lebanon as part of its campaign against the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah. In the days leading up to the incursion, Israel intensified aerial attacks against Lebanon, killing hundreds. Iran retaliated aganst the incursion with a missile attack against an Israeli air base. In a statement following Israel&apos;s ground invasion, the Foreign Ministry called on all parties &quot;to exercise maximum restraint in order to prevent the conflict from developing into a large-scale regional war.&quot; Ukraine later announced it had successfully evacuated 179 people, including 134 Ukrainian citizens. &quot;Among the Ukrainians, there are 112 adults and 22 children,&quot; the Foreign Ministry &#xA0;said. &quot;In addition, 45 people of other nationalities were evacuated&#x2014; citizens of Poland, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Moldova, Brazil and Lebanon.&quot; A dog and a cat were included in the evacuation, the ministry added. Kyiv began evacuating Ukrainians from Lebanon in early August in response to heightening tensions in the region. Since then, Ukraine has evacuated 234 people from Lebanon. The ministry thanked Poland and SkyUp Airlines for assisting with the operation.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-evacuates-179-people-from-lebanon/	2024-10-01T15:12:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/lebanon.jpg
FM Sybiha meets Polish president in Warsaw	Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha met with Polish President Andrzej Duda in Warsaw to discuss Ukraine&apos;s defense needs and bilateral relations between the two countries, Sybiha said on Oct. 1. Sybiha met with a number of Polish and other E.U. officials on Oct. 1 on the sidelines of the Warsaw Security Forum. &#xA0; &quot;We discussed Ukraine&apos;s priority defense needs, further military aid, invitation for Ukraine to join NATO, and our path to EU membership,&quot; Sybiha said on X of his meeting with Duda. &quot;We also identified ways to strengthen our good-neighborly bilateral relations.&quot; The foreign minister&apos;s meeting with Duda comes at a time of heightened tensions between Poland and Ukraine. The 1943 Volyn (Volhynia) massacre is once again at the forefront of Polish-Ukrainain relations, as the lack of resolution over the historic killings continues to surface in modern-day negotiations. During World War II, &#xA0;members of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) massacred tens of thousands of Poles in Nazi-occupied Volyn, a region that used to be part of Poland and is now part of Ukraine. Thousands of Ukrainians were killed in retaliation. Thus far, reconciliation efforts between Poland and Ukraine have not succeeded. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski on Sept. 13 called on the Ukrainian government to resolve the matter, saying it is &quot;a non-political issue that cannot be bargained over.&quot; Earlier in July, Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said that Ukraine would not be able to join the E.U. until it had settled the Volyn issue. Duda criticized these remarks, saying that obstructing Ukraine&apos;s E.U. accession aligned with Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s policies. Sikorski sparked further backlash in Ukraine among the Crimean Tatar community after he said on Sept. 19 that peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv should include &quot;demilitarizing&quot; the Crimean peninsula, which Russia has illegally occupied since 2014. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/fm-sybiha-meets-polish-president-in-warsaw/	2024-10-01T14:00:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/poland.jpeg

Ukraine war latest: Russian forces reportedly capture most of Vuhledar, Kyiv doesn't comment	Key developments on Oct. 1: Russian troops have entered the embattled town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said on Oct. 1, adding that fighting is ongoing. Speaking on national television, Filashkin described the situation as &quot;extremely difficult,&quot; adding: &quot;The enemy has already almost reached the center of the town.&quot; &quot;The fighting is going on within the town, so it is almost impossible to bring in humanitarian aid.&quot; Later in the day, videos emerged on social media showing Russian soldiers flying the country&apos;s flag on the roof of an apartment building in the town. Geolocated to the northern streets of Vuhledar&apos;s small and dense urban area, the videos suggest that a complete Ukrainian withdrawal from the town is highly likely. A total of 107 civilians remain in Vuhledar, though all children have been evacuated, he added. Ukraine&apos;s 72nd Mechanized Brigade has defended Vuhledar for nearly two years, as Russian forces have been trying to capture the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. According to the crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState on Oct. 1, Russian soldiers entered Vuhledar from the west and south. In recent days, Russian forces advanced northeast of Vuhledar and on the western outskirts of the town, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported on Sept. 30, citing geolocated footage. The front-line town lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Vuhledar has withstood numerous attacks since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022 and has become key to Ukrainian defenses in the southern part of Donetsk Oblast. Vuhledar is also the last fortified town before the village of Velyka Novosilka and the entire southern part of Donetsk Oblast that Ukraine controls. Russian troops are trying to seize new positions in the Zaporizhzhia sector to improve their tactical position, Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command spokesperson Vladyslav Voloshyn told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on Oct. 1. Voloshyn said there were indications that Russian forces were gathering troops near the towns of Pryiutne and Robotyne in order to attack Ukrainian positions. &quot;There are certain signs that (the enemy) is taking such steps: concentrating personnel and moving them to the front line, training these assault groups, accumulating ammunition,&quot; he said. Following Kyiv&apos;s ongoing incursion into Kursk Oblast, Russia reportedly began moving its troops from Ukraine&apos;s south and east to the Russian region, but Voloshyn said the number of troops in the Zaporizhzhia sector remained around the same. Russia has only redeployed certain units and specialists to the Kursk direction and is increasing the number of personnel by 2,000-3,000 soldiers per week to replenish losses, Voloshyn said. According to Voloshyn, Russia does not have enough troops to launch a large-scale offensive. &quot;No such groups have been spotted so far. Therefore, we can only say that the enemy is preparing for (smaller) assaults,&quot; Voloshyn said. In recent days, Moscow&apos;s troops have intensified attacks against Zaporizhzhia, targeting its civilian infrastructure. Ukraine can use domestically-produced weapons to hit targets inside Russia, and does not need U.S. permission to do so, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said at a briefing on Sept. 30. Kyiv has repeatedly promised it would not attack Russian territory with long-range weapons provided by Western allies without official approval. In turn, Ukraine has carried out successful attacks on targets inside Russia with homemade arms, namely long-range drones. Over the past year, Ukraine has destroyed or damaged over 200 military facilities in Russia using &quot;drone swarm&quot; technology, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said last month. According to Miller, Kyiv can use &quot;many&quot; domestically-made weapons, and has &quot;an enormous amount of material to defend itself.&quot; Ukraine is also hoping for permission to use Western-supplied long-range missiles that it already possesses to strike military targets located deep inside Russian territory. Anticipation had been high last month ahead of meetings between U.S. President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Washington, but no announcement on a decision was made. When asked why Washington could not allow Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied weapons to strike back, the spokesperson said that the White House considers all capabilities, tactics and support for Ukraine comprehensively. &quot;When we approve any new weapon system or any new tactic, we look at how it&#x2019;s going to affect the entire battlefield and Ukraine&#x2019;s entire strategy. &#xA0;And that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;ll continue to do,&quot; he added. &quot;And if you look at the weapons we&apos;ve provided them, we&apos;ve made it very clear that they can use them to retaliate against Russian targets across the border that are conducting attacks. &quot;We are always looking to see if there are additional tools we can provide them.&quot; In late August, Umerov submitted to senior U.S. officials a list of targets that Ukraine wants to hit with U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles in Russia, which included airfields used by the Russian army to launch strikes against population centers across Ukraine. Russian forces appear to have shot 16 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) in Donetsk Oblast, the largest recorded case of mass execution of surrendered soldiers on the battlefield, Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on Oct. 1. Evidence of the execution appeared on social media earlier on Oct. 1. The POWs were reportedly killed after surrendering on the front line near Pokrovsk. The Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said it was verifying the material published online and investigating the circumstances around the case. The execution of POWs is a &quot;cynical and gross violation of the Geneva Conventions,&quot; the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said. &quot;This is the most massive known case of execution of Ukrainian POWs on the front line,&quot; Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin said. &quot;The murders and torture of prisoners are not an accident, but a purposeful policy of the Russian military and political leadership,&quot; he added. In early September, Russian forces executed three Ukrainian POWs near Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast. The Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said earlier this year that it was investigating more than 50 cases of execution of Ukrainian POWs. Russian forces attacked a substation connected to the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), cutting off a power line to the facility, Ukraine&apos;s Energy Ministry said on Oct. 1. The attack put the plant &quot;on the verge&quot; of a blackout again, the ministry said in a statement, adding work was underway to restore full power. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest nuclear plant in Europe, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. Throughout its occupation, the plant has been repeatedly disconnected from the Ukrainian power grid due to Russian attacks on the country&apos;s energy infrastructure. &quot;We demand to immediately implement the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) resolution and return the occupied nuclear power plant under Ukraine&apos;s control. The safe operation of Zaporizhzhia NPP is possible only under Ukraine&apos;s control,&quot; Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said. The plant has already experienced eight complete blackouts, the state nuclear energy company Energoatom said. Ukraine&apos;s National Resistance Center reported on Sept. 15 that Russian forces continued to use the territory of the occupied power plant to deploy military personnel and store ammunition and explosives and criticized the IAEA for supposedly ignoring the fact. President Volodymyr Zelensky told the U.N. Security Council on Sept. 24 that Russia was preparing to target three Ukrainian nuclear power plants. He did not specify which stations are under threat, but said Kyiv had evidence and &quot;proof&quot; of Russia&apos;s plans. There are three operating nuclear power plants on the Ukrainian-held territory &#x2014; Rivne and Khmelnytskyi NPPs in the country&apos;s west, and Pivdennoukrainsk NPP in the south. Russia&apos;s regular attacks put their safety in jeopardy by cutting off power to the units.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russian-forces-enter-vuhledar-situation-extremely-difficult-governor-says/	2024-10-01T13:02:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1858325594-2.jpg
Ukraine boosts defense production, successfully tests ballistic missile, Zelensky says	Ukraine has exponentially increased domestic ammunition production over the past two years and has successfully tested its own ballistic missile, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 1 at Ukraine&apos;s second international defense industry forum. Ukraine hosted its first international defense industry forum in fall 2023, bringing together over 250 defense contractors from around the world. This year&apos;s forum, held in Kyiv, included nearly 300 companies from over 30 countries. Zelensky&apos;s address highlighted Ukraine&apos;s success in boosting its defense produciton capacity. &quot;In the first half of this year alone, Ukraine produced 25 times more artillery and mortar ammunition than in the entire year of 2022,&quot; Zelensky said. According to the president, Ukraine can now produce 4 million drones per year and has already contracted 1.5 million. The country is also producing between 15-20 Bohdana howitzers per month. Zelensky also discussed the development of long-range weapons, including Ukraine&apos;s Palianytsia missile-drone and homegrown ballistic missile. &quot;Our new ballistic missile has successfully passed flight tests,&quot; he said. Zelensky first mentioned that Ukraine had tested its own ballistic missile in late August, though he did not share details about the project. Domestically produced long-range weapons are of key importance to Ukraine&apos;s defense strategy as Western partners refuse to authorize deep strikes in Russia with foreign-made missiles. Despite Zelensky&apos;s appeal to Washington during his recent White House visit, the U.S. has not altered its policy on long-range strikes. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Sept. 30 that Kyiv can strike targets in the Russian interior using Ukrainian-made weapons without permission from the U.S. &#xA0; Ukraine has had success hitting military targets, including airfields and ammunition depots, deep in Russian territory using long-range drones.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-boosts-defense-production-successfully-tests-ballistic-missile-zelensky-says/	2024-10-01T12:55:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/zelensky.jpeg
The words of Ukraine’s fallen soldiers inspiring the nation to fight on	Editor&#x2019;s Note: The following is the latest in a series of reports by the Kyiv Independent about the memorialization of Ukraine&#x2019;s fallen soldiers. Ukrainians gathered at war memorials around the country on Oct. 1, the country&#x2019;s National Defenders Day, to honor the soldiers killed defending their country from Russia&apos;s invasion. At 9:00 a.m. on Kyiv&#x2019;s Independence Square, a couple hundred people stood in silence as cars on the busy street stopped for a few minutes to commemorate the fallen. Many held the portraits of defenders &#x2014; their friends, relatives and loved ones, killed or captured by Russia &#x2014; a testament to a fight that is paid for with the blood of its citizens who have chosen to take up arms to defend their country. Among the photos and flags on Independence Square, each representing a human life, people also held up handwritten signs. &#x201C;All the beautiful ones stay optimistic,&#x201D; said one sign, quoting a prominent Ukrainian activist and fighter Pavlo Petrychenko, who was killed on the front earlier this year. He represented a new generation that grew up in an independent Ukraine but had to fight for their country&#x2019;s survival and better future most of their adult lives as activists and soldiers. A third year into the existential war waged by Russia, Ukrainians are widely quoting many of them, finding inspiration in the words they left behind. The Kyiv Independent put together some of their most shared quotes that are becoming a part of the nation&#x2019;s legacy. A journalist and educator in civilian life, Iryna Tsybukh volunteered as a military medic during the full-scale Russian invasion. She shared her patriotic views on social media for tens of thousands of followers, becoming a leading voice on the memorialization of fallen soldiers and a &#x201C;moral compass&#x201D; for many Ukrainians. After Tsybukh was killed during a frontline evacuation in May, her brother published her posthumous letter that received over 100,000 likes on Instagram, inspiring many people: &#x201C;To have freedom, you need to also hold other kinds of values. You need to understand yourself, to clearly know who you are for yourself, what your personal happiness is, and how you can reach it. Once you have the answers to this question, the most important thing is to keep going.&#x201D; Iryna Tsybukh, a journalist and educator in civilian life, volunteered as a military medic and was killed on the front line. (Iryna Tsybukh / Facebook)Nazarii Hryntsevych, 21One of the youngest defenders of Mariupol who survived Russia&apos;s siege of the city&apos;s Azovstal steel mill and Russian captivity, Nazarii Hryntsevych continued to fight in the Azov regiment after he returned to Ukraine in a prisoner swap. Hryntsevych&#x2019;s most famous quote came from his comrade&#x2019;s Instagram story, where he speaks in an Azovstal shelter &#x2014; fully equipped for a fight, fresh wound on his face: &#x201C;Whatever you got going, love your mom, eat your porridge, and love Ukraine.&#x201D; Nazarii Hryntsevych, call sign &quot;Hrinka.&quot; (Screenshot of LB Live video/YouTube)Roman Ratushny, 24At 16, Roman Ratushny was among a large group of Ukrainian students violently attacked and beaten by the Ukrainian riot police during their peaceful protest in 2013 against President Viktor Yanukovych&#x2019;s pro-Kremlin government. The ensuing public outrage sparked the Euromaidan revolution. Ratushny, one of the prominent young activists who emerged there, fought illegal construction in a Kyiv park despite the threats from Ukrainian oligarchs before he volunteered to fight for Ukraine in 2022. After he was killed in battle the same year, people were galvanized by his adamant views that peace in Ukraine is impossible while Ukrainians tolerate any kind of Russian influence: &#x201C;Burn the whole Russian subculture within yourselves. Burn all childhood memories related to the Russian-Soviet. Burn your relationships with relatives or friends on the other side, with everyone who is a carrier of the Russian subculture. Otherwise, it will burn you out.&#x201D; Roman Ratushnyi was one of the most prominent Kyiv activists. He took part in the EuroMaidan Revolution at the age of 16, later standing up to Ukrainian oligarchs and corrupt officials. He volunteered to fight for Ukraine when the full-scale invasion started. Last June, 24-year-old Ratushnyi was killed in Kharkiv Oblast. (Courtesy) Andrii Pilshchykov, 30Andrii Pilshchykov, a Ukrainian top gun pilot of the new generation known as &#x2018;Juice,&#x2019; was instrumental in Ukraine&apos;s efforts to get its first batch of F-16 fighter jets from Western allies in August. Having trained with American pilots before, he used his high-profile status for numerous interviews with Western media and personal connections in the U.S. Air Force to persuade Western partners to send the fighter jets to Ukraine during a media campaign stretching for over two years. After many successful battle missions, Pilshchykov was killed in a mid-air collision of two Ukrainian jets in 2023. On Sept. 30, the eve of the Defenders Day, President Volodymyr Zelensky awarded him the title Hero of Ukraine. Like many activists, he urged Ukrainians to prepare for the hard fight in his posts online: &#x201C;I am reminding you that we have not won yet. There are still many battles ahead. This is not the time to relax. Learn, train, get equipped, act. Hope for the best and prepare for the worst.&#x201D; Portrait of Ukrainian fighter pilot Andrii Pilshchykov. (Sasha Maslov / Ministry of Defense of Ukraine / Wikimedia)Maksym Kryvtsov, 33Maksym Kryvtsov was a poet and a photographer whose sensitive work is bound to Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, which he fought for seven years in the Ukrainian army. A machine gunner on the front, Kryvtsov had a unique connection with his readers that continued online. A day before he was killed in a Russian artillery strike on his position, he posted verses from his first and only book, &#x201C;Poems From The Loophole,&#x201D; as his Facebook readers posted numbers of the specific lines and pages they wanted to see. &#x201C;Ninety percent of the poems here are about death,&#x201D; he wrote then before his own name became a synonym for the new generation of Ukrainian artists killed by Russia. Now, Ukrainians quote a line of his poem that speaks about the many deaths that Russia&#x2019;s war brought to Ukraine: &#x201C;When people ask me what war is, I will answer without hesitation: names.&#x201D; Ukrainian poet and soldier Maksym Kryvtsov, who has been killed on the front line. (Maksym Kryvtsov/Facebook)Dmytro Kotsiubailo, 27Dmytro Kotsiubailo was the first volunteer fighter outside the Ukrainian army to receive the title &#x201C;Hero of Ukraine&#x201D; during his lifetime. One of the youngest commanders in Ukrainian history, he served for all 10 years of his adult life, leading his battalion &#x201C;Da Vinci Wolves.&#x201D; For someone called &#x201C;legendary,&#x201D; Kotsiubailo carried himself humbly and treasured his troops. He was mortally wounded by Russian artillery in 2023 while checking if everyone in his unit took shelter during the attack. In his last interview with Ukrainian media, Kotsiubailo&#x2019;s dedication and belief in his comrades shines in the final sentence: &#x201C;Weapons are good, but everything depends on people. Our people are the best. They will master anything, they will do anything. That&apos;s why we will win.&#x201D; As a prominent activist at the forefront of Ukrainian civil society, Pavlo Petrychenko participated in EuroMaidan, fought to prosecute corrupt officials, and demanded justice for fellow activists, such as his friend Kateryna Handziuk, who was killed in a politically motivated attack in 2018. For the first few months of Russia&apos;s full-blown invasion, Petrychenko helped build one of the largest volunteer organizations currently aiding the Ukrainian army, the Serhii Prytula Charity Foundation. When he joined the army as a drone operator, Petrychenko kept speaking out against injustice in his sharp interviews and tweets. He was killed days before his latest online petition caused President Zelensky to sign a decree on April 20 to restrict online gambling among soldiers &#x2014; a testament to his signature determination: &#x201C;We just gotta keep pressing and pressing, and they ought to fall. Because in this war, we stand for the truth. And whoever stands for the truth must win. It has always been so through history. And if we endure this moment, then we must win.&#x201D; Pavlo Petrychenko was a well-known activist and junior sergeant of the 59th Brigade. He was killed in combat on April 15, 2024, just a day before his 32nd birthday.

His views made a difference beyond his lifetime after his unique personal funeral that he designed himself. Yuzviuk&#x2019;s story touched many Ukrainians and made it an inspiration for others &#x2014; exactly as he once advised: &#x201C;Look for motivation within yourself, or become one for somebody else.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/the-words-of-ukraines-fallen-soldiers-inspiring-the-nation-to-fight-on/	2024-10-01T12:31:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/_DSC7669-2.jpg
Ukraine will be 2nd strongest NATO member' in Europe, Latvian FM says	Ukraine will have the second-strongest military in NATO on the European continent once it joins the alliance, Latvian Foreign Minister Baiba Braze said on Oct. 1. Speaking at a panel discussion at the Warsaw Security Forum attended by the Kyiv Independent, Braze pointed out that Ukraine&apos;s military will have &quot;experience in battle&quot; and a &quot;clear political commitment to be the best.&quot; &quot;Ukraine will be the second strongest NATO member, at least on the European continent,&quot; the minister noted, adding that it will be surpassed only by the major military players like the U.S. and Turkey. Ukraine applied for NATO membership in September 2022 but has yet to receive a formal invitation. Despite high expectations in Kyiv, the last two allied summits brought only new steps toward deepening Ukraine-NATO cooperation and a declaration that the country&apos;s membership path is &quot;irreversible.&quot; Since the outbreak of the full-scale war, Ukraine has not only mobilized a large force to fend off the Russian invasion but also received extensive Western arms supplies and training and has deepened interoperability with NATO militaries. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said during the same discussion that his country &quot;must be a part of the transatlantic family&quot; and that the transatlantic community needs Ukraine to &quot;guarantee security&quot; and &quot;get more competitive advantages.&quot; Responding to a question on what the West can do to help Kyiv further, Sybiha named the necessity of acknowledging Ukraine&apos;s future NATO and EU membership. This entails implementing policies that recognize this, for example, in the EU budget. &quot;This budget must reflect... that Ukraine is the member of the EU, it must be the budget of enlargement.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s chief diplomat also listed crucial military capabilities that his country needs, including &quot;air defense systems, artillery shells, and drones&quot; and a help with scaling up Ukraine&apos;s defense industry. Sybiha further underscored the need for international support for Ukraine&apos;s peace formula. He explained that President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s victory plan, recently presented in the U.S., does not replace the formula but serves as a tool for its implementation. &quot;Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine, no compromises on our territorial integrity and sovereignty, and no compromises with the aggressor at the expense of Ukraine,&quot; the foreign minister named Kyiv&apos;s conditions. &quot;We don&apos;t have the privilege to tolerate gray zones or frozen conflicts in Europe,&quot; Sybiha said, stressing that the matter of territorial integrity includes Crimea.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-will-be-2nd-strongest-nato-member-in-europe-latvian-fm-says/	2024-10-01T12:19:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-455528558.jpg
Russian forces execute 16 Ukrainian POWs near Pokrovsk, prosecutors say	Russian forces appear to have shot 16 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) in Donetsk Oblast, the largest recorded case of mass execution of surrendered soldiers on the battlefield, Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on Oct. 1. Evidence of the execution appeared on social media earlier on Oct. 1. The POWs were reportedly killed after surrendering on the front line near Pokrovsk. The Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said it was verifying the material published online and investigating the circumstances around the case. Execution of POWs is a &quot;cynical and gross violation of the Geneva Conventions,&quot; the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said. &#xA0; &quot;This is the most massive known case of execution of Ukrainian POWs on the front line,&quot; Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin said. &quot;The murders and torture of prisoners are not an accident, but a purposeful policy of the Russian military and political leadership,&quot; he added. In early September, Russian forces executed three Ukrainian POWs near Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast. The Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said earlier this year that it was investigating more than 50 cases of execution of Ukrainian POWs.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-execute-16-ukrainian-pows-prosecutors-say/	2024-10-01T11:24:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2163602010.jpg
Estonia's planned 'war tax' unprecedented, defense minister says	Tallinn&apos;s planned security tax is &quot;unprecedented,&quot; but &quot;everybody in Estonia understands that we have to do more,&quot; Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said on Oct. 1. Speaking at a panel discussion at the Warsaw Security Forum attended by the Kyiv Independent, Pevkur explained that &quot;everybody in the society will contribute a bit more.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s unprecedented that in Estonia, we will introduce a security tax, or war tax, however you call it.&quot; The Estonian parliament is currently considering a security tax bill proposed in reaction to Russia&apos;s full-scale war in Ukraine. The legislation would apply a 2% security tax on individual and business profits starting Jan. 1, 2026, and increase the value-added tax (VAT) from 22% to 24% from July 2025. The measure would be in force until the end of 2028. Tallinn has also allocated 0.25% of its yearly GDP to support Ukraine&apos;s military needs in the coming years, calling on other partners to do the same. &quot;We are investing 3.4% (of GDP) into defense, we will go to 3.7% in 2026. Of this money, we are investing around 52-54% only in capabilities and capabilities development,&quot; Pevkur said. &quot;There will be a couple of years when we will invest 25% of our defense budget only to ammunition.&quot; Among NATO members, Estonia devoted the second-greatest share of its GDP to the defense budget in 2024, with only Poland investing more, at 4.12%. The U.S. is projected to come third, with 3.38%, followed by Estonia&apos;s neighbor Latvia. While the number of countries that meet the 2% GDP benchmark jumped to 23 this year, Pevkur believes that this threshold is no longer sufficient. &quot;We have to go to 2.5%, maybe 3%, because this gap that we have from the last 30 years is just too big.&quot; The minister noted that in the &quot;last 25 years, European Union countries increased their defense spending by 43%. At the same time, Russia increased its defense spending by 592%.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/estonia-war-tax/	2024-10-01T11:13:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/DSC02033.jpg
Neither side has political will to solve conflict.' Explaining Ukrainian-Polish deteriorating relations	A meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski on Sept. 13 in Kyiv did not go as planned. Sikorski demanded Ukraine finally allow the exhumation of Volyn massacre victims and warned against expecting a quick EU accession, sparking frustration from Zelensky, according to the Kyiv Independent&apos;s sources familiar with the matter. Zelensky reportedly accused Warsaw of politicizing historical events, falling short on promised military aid, and not fully backing Ukraine&apos;s path to EU membership. Zelensky later shared a negative opinion about the meeting with a number of people behind closed doors. Relations between Ukraine and Poland have turned sour. Again. And the tune is much the same &#x2013; a World War II massacre that has been at the center of bilateral relations between the two countries since the 1990s. Poland has been one of the strongest supporters of Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, providing billions of dollars in military, economic, and humanitarian aid and hosting millions of Ukrainian refugees. The country has also been a vocal supporter of Ukraine on the world stage, campaigning for Ukraine to receive all the required weaponry to win the war that Russia had begun. Yet, bilateral relations are far from perfect, with the two countries sharing long-standing grievances that are far from being resolved. In 2023, Warsaw banned Ukrainian agricultural imports amid large-scale protests from Polish farmers who complained about the domestic market&#x2019;s oversaturation with Ukrainian grain. This was followed by a months-long border blockade by Polish truckers over the EU&apos;s liberalization of transit rules for Ukrainian carriers, worsening tensions and harming Ukraine&#x2019;s economy. The conflict was resolved, yet political tension remained, despite a new government in power. A year later, a new conflict is brewing, this time a historical one. Poland has long pushed for exhumations of victims of the 1943 Volyn Massacre, the killings of tens of thousands of Poles by members of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) in the German-occupied Volyn region, now part of Ukraine. People hold flags and a banner reading &quot;Volhynia. 1943. We remember&quot; during a commemoration of Polish victims of the Volhynian Massacre in Krakow, Poland on July 10, 2022. (Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Ukraine blocked the exhumation in 2017 after Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) memorials in Poland were vandalized. Kyiv has said it is open to lifting the ban once all memorials are restored. Neither happened. The conflict is now in the open, and a resolution seems unlikely without political will from both sides. &#x201C;Polish-Ukrainian relations have been shaped by the interplay of historical legacies, domestic politics, and external factors, with the trajectory being de facto a sinusoid. We have seen &#x2018;highs and lows&#x2019; in the past, and this is likely to continue in the foreseeable future,&#x201D; said Andriy Korniychuk, a policy analyst at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. &#x201C;What is different now as opposed to the previous decade is an unprecedented level of political polarization in Poland in 2024, driven by political forces on both sides of the ideological spectrum in recent years.&#x201D; In July, Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said that Ukraine would not join the EU without resolving the historical issue of the mass killings of Poles in Volyn. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk later supported this statement, adding that &quot;Ukrainians must understand joining the union means entering the sphere of standards related to political and historical culture,&quot; as cited by the Polish Press Agency. Onet reported, citing an anonymous source, that the Polish Foreign Ministry might use Ukraine&apos;s EU bid to pressure Kyiv on the Volyn issue during Warsaw&apos;s presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2025. Polish President Andrzej Duda said, however, that threats to block Ukraine&apos;s accession to the European Union are in line with Kremlin policy. The foreign ministries of Ukraine and Poland did not respond to the Kyiv Independent&apos;s requests for comments at the time of publication. Ukraine is reportedly frustrated with Poland raising WWII-era issues during Russia&apos;s ongoing war when Ukraine urgently needs support from allies to survive. However, Warsaw sees no contradiction between trying to resolve the exhumation issue and helping Ukraine in its war with Russia, according to Daniel Szeligowski, head of the Eastern Europe Programme and chief analyst on Ukraine at the Polish Institute of International Affairs (PISM). &quot;From the Polish point of view, it is difficult to understand why Germany can carry out the exhumation of fallen Wehrmacht soldiers on Ukrainian territory, but Poland cannot exhume the bodies of its own citizens. This in no way affects the position of the Ukrainian army at the front line,&quot; Szeligowski told the Kyiv Independent. Ukraine maintains that Poland has failed to fulfill its part of the agreement, namely restoring a memorial plaque on the grave of Ukrainian Insurgent Army fighters on Mount Monasterz near the border with Ukraine to its original form. The plaque was physically repaired after vandalism in 2015 but without the names of fallen UPA fighters on it. Both countries differ on how to interpret the Volyn massacre, with Poland labeling it genocide for which UPA is fully responsible and Ukraine denying the term and pushing for recognizing mutual responsibility for the killings. Ukraine and Poland also don&apos;t agree on the number of victims. Szeligowski said the exhumation issue arises every year around the tragedy&apos;s anniversary in July, regardless of who&apos;s in power. But this time, tensions worsened after a controversial comment by former Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba during a meeting with young people in Poland in August. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski speaks to the media in Berlin, Germany, on Jan. 30, 2024. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Former Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in Brussels, Belgium, on Aug. 29, 2024. (Thierry Monasse/Getty Images)When asked about why Ukraine is not allowing the exhumation of the Volyn massacre victims, Kuleba moved the topic to the Polish operation Vistula, a forced resettlement of thousands of Ukrainians traditionally living in southeastern regions of Poland in 1947. Kuleba referred to the operation as occurring on &quot;Ukrainian lands.&quot; Kuleba&apos;s statement angered Polish politicians, mainly from the Law and Justice Party (PiS), who accused Kuleba of making territorial claims. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry, in a comment to the Polish Press Agency, denied the allegation and clarified that Kuleba meant areas historically inhabited by Ukrainians. The friction continued when Sikorski suggested during an off-the-record meeting at the YES conference in Kyiv on Sept. 19 to put Crimea under a U.N. mandate and carry out a referendum on the peninsula, which has been under Russian illegal occupation for over 10 years. The Crimean Tatars&apos; chief executive-representative body dismissed the proposal about Crimea&apos;s status as &quot;unacceptable and cynical,&quot; while Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry said that &quot;the territorial integrity of Ukraine has never been and cannot be a subject for discussion or compromise.&quot; Kyiv is also reportedly unhappy with Poland&apos;s delay in contributing to the Czech-led ammunition procurement for Ukraine and its reluctance to help defend Ukrainian airspace. Warsaw had committed to considering such a possibility in a bilateral security agreement signed by the two countries on July 8, but the Polish defense minister quickly stepped back, citing the lack of a NATO-level decision. Sikorski cited the detention of a key official as the reason for the delay in transferring the funds for ammunition procurement, promising 100 million euros for the initiative by 2025. Over two years into Russia&apos;s full-scale war, Polish sentiment toward Ukrainian refugees is shifting, with 61% wishing they would return home after hostilities end, according to a June poll from the Warsaw University and Warsaw Academy of Economics and Humanities. Only a third of Poles strongly believe their country should continue helping Ukraine, down from 62% in January 2023. Additionally, 72% think Poland should prioritize its own interests, including agricultural exports. &#x201C;The narrative on Ukraine is changing in Poland,&#x201D; said Yaroslav Hrytsak, a Ukrainian historian and writer. He noted a rising discourse in Poland, potentially fueled by Russia, claiming that &quot;Ukrainians are taking our jobs, receiving social benefits that we do not have, and what&#x2019;s more important, they have a different mentality.&quot; Ukrainian evacuees queue as they wait for transportation after crossing the border from Ukraine into Poland on March 29, 2022, amid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine.(Angelos Tzortzinis/AFP via Getty Images)Over 100 farmers are blocking the road with their tractors, driving very slowly, in a protest against duty-free trade with Ukraine in Grojec, Poland, on Feb. 9, 2024. (Piotr Lapinski/NurPhoto via Getty Images)This shift is reflected in Polish politicians&#x2019; increasing criticism of Ukraine as they prepare for the May 2025 presidential election, experts say. Kosiniak-Kamysz&apos;s remarks on the Volyn massacre align with the sentiment of his agrarian party, while Tusk and Sikorski&apos;s comments may aim to steal voters from the Law and Justice Party (PiS), which is conservative and had long focused on the country&#x2019;s historical grievances, according to Dr. Stanislav Zhelikhovskyi, a Ukrainian political scientist and a corresponding member of the Ukrainian Academy of Geopolitics and Geostrategy. Sikorski&#x2019;s suggestion of a potential referendum in Russian-occupied Crimea could also be a political maneuver targeting a more conservative electorate as he likely eyes a presidential bid, Zhelikhovskyi told the Kyiv Independent. Korniychuk also highlighted the significance of historical narratives and their influence on public discourse and political mobilization in Poland. &#x201C;It comes against the (backdrop) of a European trend that sees far-right parties and movements gaining an alarming level of mainstream recognition,&#x201D; he said, speaking with the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Therefore, the ruling center-left coalition in Poland simply can&#x2019;t allow itself to refrain from leaving these issues unaddressed, thus allowing center-right, conservative, nationalist, and radical political forces to set the temperature of the discussion but also actively exploit different messages in their own political campaigns.&#x201D; Conversely, Szeligowski argues that the deterioration of the Volyn massacre dispute reflects unmet expectations rather than political agendas. After the Russian full-scale invasion, many Polish politicians hoped that Warsaw&#x2019;s large-scale support for Ukraine would prompt Kyiv to unblock the exhumations, according to Szeligowski. &#x201C;As this did not happen and recent statements from the Ukrainian side were widely perceived in Poland as antagonistic, a consensus has emerged among the main political forces in Poland that the policy towards Ukraine had been too little assertive and too little transactional,&#x201D; he said. With Poland&apos;s presidential elections approaching and no resolution in sight over fundamental disagreements on the Volyn massacre, the Polish-Ukrainian conflict will likely persist. &quot;This pre-election game will continue for months, likely with more criticisms and actions from Polish politicians seeking to win votes,&quot; said Zhelikhovskyi. He predicts that relations may stabilize after the elections, but they won&apos;t return to the &quot;honeymoon&quot; period of 2022. Hrytsak believes neither country has the political will to resolve the issues of exhuming Volyn massacre victims or restoring Ukrainian memorials in Poland, suggesting both sides may be using the conflict for political gain. Hrytsak suggested that Zelensky&apos;s team might use Polish threats to block Ukraine&apos;s EU membership over the Volyn massacre to shift blame onto Poland for what would likely be a slower accession than the government had promised Ukrainians. Szeligowski believes that &quot;the greater the delay by Ukraine in unblocking the exhumations, the greater the political cost that Ukraine will bear in the future.&quot; &quot;First, Poland may reduce its diplomatic activity in support of Ukraine &#x2014; instead of being always in the front row and keep mobilizing allies, Poland may stand in the rear pragmatically like Germany or simply be passive,&quot; said Szeligowski. He also noted that the ratification of Ukraine&apos;s EU accession treaty might not only run into problems in Poland due to the lack of a parliamentary majority but even be put to a referendum, with uncertain outcomes if historical disputes persist. However, simply allowing the exhumation of the Volyn massacre victims and restoring Ukrainian memorials in Poland would not be enough for a full reconciliation between Ukraine and Poland, which saw multiple conflicts in the past. To ensure good neighborly relations, Ukraine must officially take responsibility for the Volyn massacre as an act of ethnic cleansing, while Poland should admit to its repressive policies against Ukrainians prior to the massacre, said Hrytsak. However, it&apos;s hard to imagine Ukraine admitting that some of its national resistance forces had conducted ethnic cleansing during World War II amid Ukraine&apos;s existential fight against the Russian war of aggression, which kills Ukrainian civilians on a daily basis. Therefore, Hrytsak believes the Polish-Ukrainian conflict will unlikely be solved until the end of Russia&apos;s war. Korniychuk echoed this statement, saying that &#x201C;amid an ongoing brutal war, it is extremely difficult to contest and revise historical narratives and symbolic spaces as it requires a thorough process of public debate and consultation, which is de facto impossible during martial law.&#x201D; &#x201C;Hence, we can also observe Russia&apos;s deliberate targeting of these contentious historical issues in its propaganda and disinformation campaigns against both countries at what seems to be another critical juncture during the full-scale war,&#x201D; he added. Korniychuk suggested that Poland and Ukraine should try to find common ground in the framework of strategic communication, ensuring that the challenges are recognized even if addressing them would take time. &#x201C;In the end, silence and disagreements simply allow other malicious actors, such as Russia, to impact or hijack the narrative.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/historical-grievances-resurface-in-polish-ukrainian-relations-threatening-to-stall-kyivs-eu-accession/	2024-10-01T11:09:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/photo_2023-07-09_11-39-24.jpg
European defense manufacturer KNDS opens office in Ukraine	French-German defense company KNDS has opened an office in Kyiv to support Ukraine carry out the domestic maintenance and repair of land systems and produce artillery ammunition, the company announced on Oct. 1. KNDS is one of Europe&apos;s biggest defense companies, formed from a 2015 merger of the German company Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and the French company Nexter Systems. The subsidiary KNDS Ukraine LLC &quot;will support the cooperation between Ukrainian government institutions, the Ukrainian armaments industry, and KNDS,&quot; &#xA0;the press release said. KNDS makes around 800 systems used by or contracted for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, including the Caesar artillery gun, the Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft gun tank, and the &#xA0;PzH 2000 armored howitzer. KNDS also intends to jointly manufacture NATO-standard 155 mm artillery ammunition and produce spare parts with the Ukrainian industry. Ukraine has long tried to ramp up domestic ammunition production to become more independent from Western partners. In the summer of 2023, the company Ukrainian Defense Industry said that it had already mastered the production of 82 mm mortar mines, 122 mm, and 152 mm artillery rounds, as well as 125 mm tank shells. Alexander Kamyshin, the former strategic industries minister, announced in early September that Ukraine was already producing its own 155 mm artillery ammunition.	https://kyivindependent.com/knds-opens-subsidiary-in-ukraine/	2024-10-01T10:38:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2158869098.jpg
Foreign Ministry refutes FT report that minister discussed territorial compromises	Ukraine&apos;s new Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha did not discuss territorial compromises with Russia in recent meetings with his Western counterparts, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said on Oct. 1, refuting a report by the Financial Times (FT) that he had discussed &quot;potential compromise solutions.&quot; &quot;I attended every single meeting of Foreign Minister Sybiha in New York, and no territorial compromises were suggested, discussed, or even hinted at during any of the meetings,&quot; Tykhyi said. &quot;To the contrary, the Minister&#x2019;s position is rock solid and he emphasized it behind closed doors,&quot; Tykhyi said. &quot;There can be no compromise on Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty or territorial integrity.&quot; Tykhyi&apos;s comments referred to an FT article on Oct. 1 that said Sybiha privately discussed potential compromises with Western counterparts during his trip to New York for the U.N. General Assembly last week. The FT cited multiple European diplomats who attended the U.N. General Assembly. The diplomats reportedly noted &quot;more openness from Ukrainian officials to discuss the potential for agreeing a ceasefire even while Russian troops remain on their territory.&quot; Sybiha allegedly &quot;struck a more pragmatic tone on the possibility of land-for-security negotiations&quot; than his predecessor Dmytro Kuleba, the FT said. According to Tykhyi, the information from the FT&apos;s sources is &quot;simply false&quot; and leaves questions regarding &quot;who would be interested in spreading such false narratives.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/foreign-ministry-refutes-ft-report-that-minister-discussed-compromises/	2024-10-01T09:56:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2170643164.jpg
Ukrainian commanders to be able to directly select volunteer fighters, defense minister announces	Commanders of Ukrainian military units will now be able to directly select soldiers who enlist voluntarily, bypassing the standard process of involving enlistment offices, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Oct. 1. Ukraine is undertaking a campaign to modernize military recruitment, aiming to streamline mobilization, combat corruption, and improve other army processes that have been hampered by Soviet-era practices. Under the new rules, those who enlist voluntarily into specific units can be recruited by commanders without having to go through the enlistment offices, known as territorial recruitment centers. The centers have earned a reputation in Ukraine for malpractice and corruption. The new system will allow for &quot;high-quality recruiting,&quot; Umerov said. Commanders will be able to personally select volunteers, &quot;taking into account their skills, experience, and aspirations.&quot; &quot;For every Ukrainian man and woman, this is a chance to find their place in the ranks of defenders, where their abilities will bring the greatest benefit,&quot; Umerov said.	https://kyivindependent.com/commanders-directly-select-fighters/	2024-10-01T08:53:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/Karina-Piliuhina-9.jpg
Two years on, the Nord Stream explosion remains a mystery, deepening European divide	Two years after a series of explosions tore apart Russia&#x2019;s controversial Nord Stream pipelines, the investigation has largely remained a mystery full of accusations that have exposed political fault lines across Europe. Stretching from northwestern Russia under the Baltic Sea to Germany&#x2019;s coast, the pipelines completed before Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion are a long-standing project that aimed to boost Russian gas flow into Western Europe, symbolic of the old energy pact between Moscow and Berlin that now seems like a mistake. The multifaceted investigation that followed the detonation and subsequent effective destruction of three out of four pipelines in September 2022 has essentially run on two separate tracks: the hard police work of determining who was responsible and the larger rethinking of the strategy to integrate Russia into the West via energy trade. In practice, the two have become intertwined as competing camps have latched on to the continuing mystery of the explosion to pursue their own political agendas. Soon after the explosion, it was quickly determined that it was no accident. Due to the location of the pipelines in international waters, but also within Danish and Swedish maritime economic zones, as well as the involvement of Russia and Germany as the source and end-point of the pipelines, the investigation inherently involved numerous countries. Initially, there was speculation that Russia was responsible for the explosions. Gerhard Schindler, the former head of Germany&#x2019;s national intelligence agency, said days after the underwater explosions that &#x201C;only Russia can really be considered for this, especially since it stands to gain the most from this act of sabotage.&#x201D; In the lead-up to Russia&#x2019;s full-blown war against Ukraine, Germany bowed to pressure and halted the Nord Stream 2 project. Schindler and others in Germany and Western Europe argued at the time that Russia may have destroyed its own pipelines in an act of revenge that would raise gas prices in an attempt to show Europeans the cost of severing economic ties with Russia. At the same time, Russia cast a wide net of accusations, claiming that the U.S., the U.K., or others were responsible. The alleged involvement of the U.S. later was echoed by conspiracy theorists like Seymour Hersh, who claimed, citing unnamed sources, that it was directly ordered by President Joe Biden. The receiving station for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline stands at twilight near Lubmin, Germany on Feb. 2, 2022. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)In March 2023, the New York Times and other media outlets began sharing intelligence that indicated Ukraine might have been responsible. While Ukrainian officials had openly campaigned against the pipelines and referred to them as a security threat that bypassed Ukrainian gas transit pipelines by making European markets more dependent on Russian fuel supplies, they also denied they had anything to do with the attack. U.S. officials said at the time there was no evidence that President Volodymyr Zelensky or anyone in his top circle was involved &#x2014; or that the attackers operated on the orders of the Ukrainian government. The Danish and Swedish investigations concluded in early 2024 without identifying any suspects. The Wall Street Journal wrote in January 2024, citing unnamed German investigators, that the attackers may have operated from Poland, and further claimed that the Polish government was &#x201C;hindering&#x201D; the probe. But intelligence leaks and speculation continued, with an increasing number of fingers being pointed at Ukraine. The most concrete accusations came in August 2024, when the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) wrote, citing unnamed sources, that the explosion was ordered by then Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Valerii Zaluzhnyi and carried out by a team of Ukrainian saboteurs. The WSJ claimed that Zelensky had initially approved the attack, but then changed his mind and asked Zaluzhnyi to call it off. Separate stories by German media outlets that said that Berlin had issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian diving instructor &#x2014; coincidentally identified as Volodymyr Z. &#x2014; only deepened the sense of Kyiv&#x2019;s involvement. Later, Poland said it had received the arrest warrant but that Volodymyr Z had already left the country. Nonetheless, Zaluzhnyi dismissed the allegations as a &#x201C;provocation,&#x201D; and Kyiv continued to deny that it was behind the explosion. As of the time of this publication, there is no concrete answer, but that has not stopped the blame game, which has become imbued with deeper political implications. Across the board, various officials and commentators have used the Nord Stream explosion as a political weapon, tying their accusations to underlying positions on Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war on Ukraine. Those already opposed to Western support for Ukraine have often cited Kyiv&#x2019;s alleged involvement in the attack as yet another reason to end or at least cut aid for the country. In an interview with far-right commentator Tucker Carlson in April 2023, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump insinuated that the U.S. was responsible, echoing past suggestions that it was either Washington &#x2014; or Kyiv &#x2014; but not Russia. Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump delivers remarks to the press at Trump Tower in New York City, U.S. on Sep. 26, 2024. (Angela Weiss / AFP via Getty Images)Trump&#x2019;s comments on Nord Stream fit in a larger pattern of invoking Ukraine to attack his then-political opponent, Biden. The former president also claimed that he had &#x201C;stopped&#x201D; the pipeline project while in his office and alleged that it was under Biden that it flourished. For Trump and others who repeatedly warn that U.S. support for Ukraine would lead to escalation with Russia, the implication of Ukrainian involvement in the explosion is yet another example. Just days after the explosion was first reported, Trump shared old comments from Biden, in which he said, &#x201C;If Russia invades&#x2026;then there will no longer be a Nord Stream 2. We will put a stop to it.&#x201D; Trump added: &#x201C;Wow, what a statement. World War III, anyone?&#x201D; Among European countries that support Ukraine, the pipeline explosion has also been used as a rhetorical tool, but for another purpose &#x2014; to castigate Germany for leading the charge in cementing the EU&#x2019;s dependence on Russian energy in the first place. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk made waves in August 2024 when he responded to the suggestion of Warsaw&#x2019;s involvement by saying, &#x201C;To all the initiators and patrons of Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2. The only thing you should do today about it is apologize and keep quiet.&#x201D; While he did not mention anyone by name, it was clear he was referring to Germany, the main &#x201C;patron&#x201D; of the project. Czech President Petr Pavel went even further, saying that even if Ukraine was behind the attack, the pipeline would have been &#x201C;a legitimate goal&#x201D; for Kyiv to try and cut energy revenues flowing back to Moscow. German allegations that Poland may have been involved were &#x201C;inspired by Moscow&quot; with the aim of destabilizing NATO, said Krzysztof Gawkowski, a deputy Polish prime minister and the minister of digital affairs. Critics of the pipeline, which included many in central and eastern Europe, had long argued that Germany was misguided in going forward with the project.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Beyond eliminating potential profits that an overland pipeline could give Poland and other countries, Nord Stream deepened the EU&#x2019;s dependence on Russian energy and raised fears long before the full-scale war that Moscow would use such reliance as a tool to exert pressure. When Russia did just that after February 2022 &#x2014; threatening to cut off energy supplies to the EU in response to its support for Ukraine, there was a sense of vindication from those who had long warned of the threat of energy dependence. The bloc&#x2019;s response to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, in which Poland, Czechia, the Baltic states, and other countries previously thought to be on the periphery of the center of power in Brussels have emerged to be most committed to its defense from Russia, have fueled the argument that Germany&#x2019;s policy was a failure.	https://kyivindependent.com/two-years-on-the-nord-stream-explosion-remains-a-mystery-but-it-has-revealed-fissures-in-europe/	2024-10-01T07:48:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1243544531.jpg
Ukraine names pro-Russian collaborators suspected of forcibly deporting Ukrainian children	Several Russia-installed proxy officials in occupied Donetsk Oblast have been declared suspected of forcibly deporting 31 Ukrainian children to Russia, Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office announced on Oct. 1. The Prosecutor General&apos;s Office named Denys Pushylin, the Russia-installed proxy head of Donetsk Oblast, and two of his officials, Eleanora Fedorenko and Svitlana Maiboroda, as suspects in the case. Maiboroda was identified by the Kyiv Independent&apos;s War Crimes Investigations Unit in their documentary &quot;Uprooted.&quot; The team passed on the evidence collected during the making of the film to the prosecutors. The Prosecutor General&apos;s Office expressed gratitude to Ukrainian investigative journalists, including the Kyiv Independent, who conducted investigations into the case and passed on their materials. Russian authorities and their collaborators have illegally deported thousands of Ukrainian children from occupied territories to Russia and placed them in foster families, where they are raised as Russians. This particular case concerns the deportation of 19 orphans from Mariupol and nine children from the cities of Shakhtarsk and Khartsyzk in Donetsk Oblast. Another three children from Mariupol were taken away from their father at a filtration camp. The suspects facilitated the deportation of the children, the youngest of whom was six years old at the time, from Ukraine. The transfer of the children &quot;did not meet the requirements of international humanitarian law, as it was not justified by security or health reasons,&quot; the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office noted. According to the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office, the children were first taken by bus to Rostov-on-Don and later taken by plane to Moscow. &#xA0; Ukrainian investigators found that the plane used to organize the flight belongs to a particular unit that is subordinate to Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s administration. Despite being Ukrainian, the children were issued Russian passports and given to Russian adoptive families. Among the group was a 17-year-old from Mariupol who was effectively adopted by Maria Lvova-Belova, Putin&apos;s Commissioner for Children&apos;s Rights and the Kremlin official who allegedly oversees the forced deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova for their roles in the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children. The three children from Mariupol managed to reunite with their father on their own, while three teenagers were returned to Ukraine by the Ukrainian authorities. The other 25 children remain in Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-officials-suspected-of-forcibly-deporting-children/	2024-10-01T07:19:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1240568267.jpg
Biden may advance Ukraine's NATO membership bid status, FT reports	U.S. President Joe Biden may agree to advance the status of Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership bid before leaving office in January, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Oct. 1, citing an unnamed Western official. The FT&apos;s source briefed on President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s recent trip to the U.S. did not provide further details. Zelensky presented his five-point victory plan to Biden at the White House on Sept. 26. The plan includes military and diplomatic components, including Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO, but the full details of the peace framework have not yet been publicized. According to the information obtained by the Kyiv Independent, Kyiv had planned to ask for NATO membership within the months, not years. Biden previously said that peace in Ukraine means a guarantee that Russia will never occupy the country again, but Kyiv&apos;s membership in NATO is not necessary for this. Later in June, Zelensky and the U.S. president signed a security agreement between the two nations, which was described as a &quot;bridge&quot; to Ukraine&apos;s future NATO membership. However, the deal did not outline new prospects for Kyiv to join the alliance. The July NATO summit in Washington ended with the launch of the Ukraine Compact, a security framework signed by 32 allies. The countries affirmed Kyiv&apos;s &quot;irreversible&quot; path toward membership, though Ukraine did not receive any definitive news about its future accession. According to Zelensky, who has repeatedly called on partners to issue a membership invitation to Kyiv, Ukraine will join NATO only after Russia&apos;s full-scale war ends.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-may-advance-ukraines-nato-membership-bid-status-ft-reports/	2024-10-01T06:03:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173752349.jpg
Russia's Crimean Bridge defenses are reportedly washing up on shore	Barriers put in place to protect the Crimean Bridge from Ukrainian attacks have been washed ashore after a recent storm, it was reported on Sept. 30. According to the Crimean Wind Telegram channel, plastic and metal barrels connected by metal frames were spotted littering the beach in Kerch on the occupied peninsula. &quot;The local population dismantles them and takes away the metal, and the plastic barrels remain on the beach,&quot; it added. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the report, but Russia has taken steps in recent weeks to bolster the defenses of the Crimean Bridge. Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk on Sept. 26 said Russian forces were building a new but unidentified structure near the structure, but added deteriorating weather conditions as winter approaches would make it difficult to complete. &quot;They are constantly trying to place something new in the Kerch Strait, to build various hydrotechnical or barrier structures. But periodically they end up on the shore after another storm,&quot; he said. A day later it was reported Russia was attempting to bolster defenses around the Crimean Bridge using underwater drone traps. Construction on the 19-kilometer-long bridge began after the illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014 and was completed in 2018. After becoming a critical supply route for Russian forces after the launch of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion, it has been attacked by Kyiv&apos;s forces on several occasions, and was heavily damaged by Ukrainian strikes in October 2022 and July 2023. The Crimean Bridge is currently the subject of a dispute between Ukraine and Russia at the Permanent Court of Arbitration Speaking there on Sept. 23, Ambassador-at-Large at the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, Anton Korynevych, said Russia &quot;wants to take the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait for itself.&quot; &quot;So it has built a great gate at their entrance, to keep international shipping out while allowing small Russian river vessels in,&quot; he said. &quot;The bridge is unlawful, and it must come down.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-crimean-bridge-defenses-are-reportedly-washing-up-on-shore/	2024-10-01T05:46:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-01-15_40_16.jpeg
Russia attempts to capture new positions in Zaporizhzhia sector, preparing small-scale assaults, military says	Russian troops are trying to seize new positions in the Zaporizhzhia sector to improve their tactical position, Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command spokesperson Vladyslav Voloshyn told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on Oct. 1. Voloshyn said there were indications that Russian forces were gathering troops near the towns of Pryiutne and Robotyne in order to attack Ukrainian positions. &quot;There are certain signs that (the enemy) is taking such steps: concentrating personnel and moving them to the frontline, training these assault groups, accumulating ammunition,&quot; he said. Following Kyiv&apos;s ongoing incursion into Kursk Oblast, Russia reportedly began moving its troops from Ukraine&apos;s south and east to the Russian region, but Voloshyn said the number of troops in the Zaporizhzhia sector remained the around the same. Russia has only redeployed certain units and specialists to the Kursk direction and is increasing the number of personnel by 2,000-3,000 soldiers per week to replenish losses, Voloshyn said. &quot;This is not a build-up and increase of forces and means,&quot; he said. According to Voloshyn, Russia does not have enough troops to launch a large-scale offensive. &quot;No such groups have been spotted so far. Therefore, we can only say that the enemy is preparing for (smaller) assaults,&quot; Voloshyn said. In recent days, Moscow&apos;s troops have intensified attacks against Zaporizhzhia, targeting its civilian infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/zaporizhzhia-sector-assaults/	2024-10-01T05:22:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1733436357.jpg
Germany's Scholz hoping for phone call with Putin, Zeit reports	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is hoping to speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone for the first time in almost two years, the German newspaper Zeit reported on Oct. 1. Citing sources in &quot;government circles,&quot; the outlet said an official request to the Kremlin has not yet been made, but Berlin plans to make it happen in the run-up to the G20 meeting in Brazil in November. Zeit did not report what Scholz plans to discuss with Putin. Scholz last spoke with Putin in December 2022, the same year the leaders of the U.S., France, and the U.K. last had direct contact. Initially a hesitant partner, Germany has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. On Sept. 4, Scholz said that Germany ordered an additional 17 IRIS-T air defense systems for Ukraine, Bloomberg reported. By 2026, Ukraine should receive 24 IRIS-T systems from Germany &#x2014; 12 of medium-range versions and 12 short-range. But amid ongoing discussions among Ukraine&apos;s Western allies about using their weapons to strike deep inside Russia, Scholz continues to insist Berlin will not grant Kyiv permission to use its Taurus missiles to do so. President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Scholz on Sept. 23 on the sidelines of the 79th United Nations General Assembly in New York City. Shortly before the meeting, Scholz reaffirmed Berlin&apos;s refusal to allow Ukraine to use German weapons to strike targets within Russia. &quot;Germany will not lift any restrictions,&quot; Scholz said in response to queries from reporters regarding long-range strikes in Russia. &quot;This does not depend on my personal attitude. We will not do that, and we have good reasons for that.&quot; Scholz said his position would not change even if the U.S. lifts restrictions, and said that Germany aims to &quot;focus on what really helps and what is needed&quot; in terms of supporting Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/germanys-scholz-hoping-for-phone-call-with-putin-zeit-reports/	2024-10-01T04:37:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175014888.jpg
Ukraine top of the agenda as Mark Rutte takes up NATO general secretary role	NATO has to ensure that Ukraine &quot;prevails as a sovereign, independent, democratic nation,&quot; Mark Rutte said on Oct. 1, as he took the helm as the new secretary general of the military alliance. Speaking alongside the outgoing Jens Stoltenberg during a press conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Rutte praised his predecessor&apos;s achievements during his tenure. &quot;You&#x2019;ve already mentioned the priorities you&#x2019;ve been working on and these priorities we&#x2019;ll take forward in the future &#x2014; Ukraine,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to make sure that Ukraine prevails as a sovereign, independent, democratic nation.&quot; Rutte added that NATO members have to &quot;spend more&quot; in order to &quot;increase our collective defense,&quot; adding: &quot;NATO&#x2019;s partnerships&#x2026; have to go wider, and deeper, given all the insecurities in the world.&quot; Answering questions from reporters, Rutte also addressed the upcoming U.S. presidential election, diplomatically addressing both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. &quot;I know both candidates very well. I worked for four years with Donald Trump. He was pushing us to spend more, and he achieved it &#x2014; at the moment we are at a much higher spending level,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;He was also pushing us off China, and he was right. &quot;Of course, Kamala Harris has a fantastic record as vice president, she is a highly respected figure. So, I hope, I will be able to work with both.&quot; Ukraine is still hoping to join NATO, and an invitation is part of Kyiv&apos;s victory plan, the head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak said on Sept. 24. Ukraine applied for NATO membership in September 2022, half a year into Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The July NATO summit in Washington ended with the launch of the Ukraine Compact, a security framework signed by 32 allies. The countries affirmed Kyiv&apos;s &quot;irreversible&quot; path toward membership, though Ukraine did not receive any definitive news about its future accession.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-top-of-the-agenda-as-mark-rutte-takes-up-nato-general-secretary-role/	2024-10-01T03:42:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175229416.jpg
Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia kills 1 person, injures 6	Russian forces attacked the city of Zaporizhzhia on Oct. 1, killing one person and injuring at least six others, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. Russia launched at least six guided aerial bombs against Zaporizhzhia, damaging apartment buildings and houses. The city&apos;s infrastructure facilities were also hit, Fedorov said. In recent days, Moscow&apos;s troops have intensified attacks against Zaporizhzhia, targeting its civilian infrastructure. A guided aerial bomb was used to target the city for the first time on Sept. 23. Overnight on Sept. 29, Russia&apos;s strike against the city injured 16 people, including an eight-year-old girl and a 17-year-old boy, according to local authorities. The city of Zaporizhzhia is located less than 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the front lines. Russia has continued to strike civilian targets across Zaporizhzhia Oblast, which is partially occupied by Russian forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-zaporizhzhia-kills/	2024-10-01T03:14:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-01_12-49-55.jpg
The Counteroffensive: Why doesn’t Ukraine have a national military cemetery?	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article was published by the twice-weekly newsletter &#x201C;The Counteroffensive with Tim Mak&#x201D; on Sept. 28, 2024, and has been re-published by the Kyiv Independent with permission. To subscribe to The Counteroffensive, click here. Vira Lytvynenko hasn&#x2019;t been able to bury her son since March 2022, when he was killed defending Ukraine against a Russian offensive near the Mariupol Drama Theater. Instead, she keeps his ashes at home. Even in the third year of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, and over 10 years since the war began, Ukraine still does not have a national military cemetery. Many veterans and their families fear this neglect reflects a lack of respect for those who sacrificed their lives. It&#x2019;s as if there were no Arlington National Cemetery in the United States &#x2013; a sacred space for remembrance and a powerful symbol of national gratitude. Ukrainians yearn for a similar space to honor their soldiers. &#x201C;The state should have provided the best possible honoring of its fallen&#x2026; there are certain sacred and infallible things in society. Civilian cemeteries are already running out of space,&#x201D; said Taras Ishchyk, who is serving in the Ukrainian military. Instead of transparently constructing a national memorial cemetery, the authorities have dragged out the selection of a site, proposing locations far from Kyiv. The design and tendering process is marred by scandals and corruption, which critics say further diminishes the significance of soldiers&apos; sacrifices. Vladyslav Lytvynenko, Vira&#x2019;s son, was a soldier with Ukraine&#x2019;s Azov Brigade. He hailed from Donetsk Oblast and lived in Mariupol until 2014 when Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine&#x2019;s Donbas region and annexation of Crimea forced his family to move to Kyiv. In 2015, Vladyslav returned to Mariupol and joined Azov, where he fought in several battles. &#x201C;In 2022, he (Vladyslav) was supposed to leave the army and start a civilian life, because he hadn&#x2019;t experienced it as an adult, having been fighting since he was 20,&#x201D; Vira said, her eyes slowly filling with tears. Vira is just one among many families waiting to honor their fallen. According to Olena Tolkachova, the head of the Azov Patronage Service, which cares for the brigade&#x2019;s soldiers and families, the service has been advocating for a national military cemetery since 2014. &#x201C;We have a family who is so hopeful for this particular (military) cemetery that they did not take the body out (of the morgue),&#x201D; Tolkachova said. &#x201C;And they are already in such a very depressed state because the cemetery has not been built in two years.&#x201D; But despite the urgency, there has been little progress. Local regions have been left to bury their soldiers within existing cemeteries, where graves often blend in with civilian ones. It wasn&#x2019;t until May 2022 that a law was passed to simplify the land and construction procedures for the national cemetery. The Kyiv city administration designated a site near Bykivnia forest, a burial ground for victims of former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin&#x2019;s repressions. In August 2023, however, the government abruptly changed the site. The new location is over 20 kilometers from Kyiv&apos;s center, frustrating families like Vira&apos;s, who must now endure a two-hour commute to visit their loved ones. The cemetery, initially envisioned as a place easily accessible to the public to honor Ukraine&#x2019;s sacrifices, now risks obscurity due to its distance. Some families have already buried their relatives locally, tired of waiting. Others, like Vira, continue to hold out hope.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)In the summer of 2023, Serhii Derbin was selected as the project&#x2019;s architect, though there was no open competition for the large-scale national project. A tender was posted in the electronic public procurement system, but only one person allegedly applied. &quot;No one even knew about the design tender,&quot; said Dartsia Verytiuk, the creator of the Pantheon of Heroes concept in Ternopil. In response, Derbin told The Counteroffensive that the tender was officially announced on the website, available to anyone who wished to participate. By the end of 2023, families were still unable to bury their fallen soldiers. The cemetery&#x2019;s design wasn&#x2019;t presented until December 2023, alongside new legislation to create the site. The current design has been criticized for combining mismatched architectural elements, resembling both a supermarket and an ancient temple. Verytiuk, who had made suggestions for the memorial, said, &quot;None of our comments were accepted, and the project wasn&#x2019;t changed at all. It became clear everything had been decided long ago.&quot; However, Derbin claimed that most professional feedback had been incorporated and that all decisions were balanced and well-considered. In July 2024, a tender for the cemetery&#x2019;s construction was announced. Only one consortium, Building UA, formed the day after the tender was posted, applied for the $44 million (1.8 billion hryvnias) project. Critics were baffled by the government&apos;s preference for granite over lighter materials for the gravestones. As journalist Dariia Hirna explained, lighter-colored sandstone would evoke peace and tranquility, while gray or black granite could create an atmosphere of sadness. One of the companies that won the tender was Akam, a granite producer from Dnipro. Akam belongs to a group of companies owned by Vadym Yermolaiev, who was sanctioned by President Zelensky in 2023 for conducting business in Russian-occupied territories. Yermolaiev&#x2019;s whereabouts are unknown, and The Counteroffensive could not reach him for comment. Construction at the cemetery has since been halted. In September, the Security Bureau of Ukraine (SBU) confirmed that Akam was part of Yermolaiev&apos;s sanctioned group of companies. &quot;This is a crime against the families of fallen soldiers and those still serving. Both tenders should be canceled, and an open international competition should be held instead,&quot; said serviceman Ishchyk. This means that even this year, Ukraine&#x2019;s fallen defenders will not find peace at a national cemetery, and their families will still have no place to honor them. That includes Vira Lytvynenko, whose son gave his life for Ukraine&#x2019;s independence.

Russian forces enter Vuhledar, situation 'extremely difficult,' governor says	Russian troops have entered the embattled town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said on Oct. 1, adding that fighting is ongoing. Speaking on national television, Filashkin described the situation as &quot;extremely difficult,&quot; adding: &quot;The enemy has already almost reached the center of the town.&quot; &quot;The fighting is going on within the town, so it is almost impossible to bring in humanitarian aid.&quot; A total of 107 civilians remain in Vuhledar, though all children have been evacuated, he added. Ukraine&apos;s 72nd Mechanized Brigade has defended Vuhledar for nearly two years, as Russian forces have been trying to capture the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. On Sept. 26, the brigade refuted reports that it was retreating and released a video from the town. According to the crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState on Oct. 1, Russian soldiers entered Vuhledar from the west and south. In recent days, Russian forces advanced northeast of Vuhledar and on the western outskirts of the town, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported on Sept. 30, citing geolocated footage. The front-line town lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Vuhledar has withstood numerous attacks since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022 and has become key to Ukrainian defenses in the southern part of Donetsk Oblast. &quot;Potentially (its loss could) threaten the security of the entire southwestern portion of Donetsk Oblast not yet occupied,&quot; Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent earlier in September. Vuhledar is located north of a key intersection connecting the O-0532 road towards Vodiane and Kostiantynivka, a small paved road toward Kurakhove, and the partly occupied T-0509 highway toward Velyka Novosilka. &quot;It is, therefore, a key logistic point for Ukrainian forces defending the southern flank of Kurakhove,&quot; Borsari said. Given the Russian significant advance towards Pokrovsk from the east in recent weeks, Ukrainian forces need to avoid a similar development from the south to avoid the risk of encirclement, Borsari added. Vuhledar is also the last fortified town before the village of Velyka Novosilka and the entire southern part of Donetsk Oblast that Ukraine controls. The occupied section of the T-0509 highway, which passes south of Vuhledar, is essential for Russian forces trying to advance westward.	https://kyivindependent.com/vuhledar/	2024-10-01T02:05:26-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1785368869.jpg
Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant 'on verge of blackout' after Russian attack on substation, Ukraine says	Russian forces attacked a substation connected to the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), cutting off a power line to the facility, Ukraine&apos;s Energy Ministry said on Oct. 1. The attack put the plant &quot;on the verge&quot; of a blackout again, the ministry said in a statement, adding work was underway to restore full power. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest nuclear plant in Europe, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. Throughout its occupation, the plant has been repeatedly disconnected from the Ukrainian power grid due to Russian attacks on the country&apos;s energy infrastructure. &quot;We demand to immediately implement the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) resolution and return the occupied nuclear power plant under Ukraine&apos;s control. The safe operation of Zaporizhzhia NPP is possible only under Ukraine&apos;s control,&quot; Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said. The plant has already experienced eight complete blackouts, the state nuclear energy company Energoatom said. Ukraine&apos;s National Resistance Center reported on Sept. 15 that Russian forces continued to use the territory of the occupied power plant to deploy military personnel and store ammunition and explosives and criticized the IAEA for supposedly ignoring the fact. President Volodymyr Zelensky told the U.N. Security Council on Sept. 24 that Russia was preparing to target three Ukrainian nuclear power plants. He did not specify which stations are under threat, but said Kyiv had evidence and &quot;proof&quot; of Russia&apos;s plans. There are three operating nuclear power plants on the Ukrainian-held territory &#x2014; Rivne and Khmelnytskyi NPPs in the country&apos;s west, and Pivdennoukrainsk NPP in the south. Russia&apos;s regular attacks put their safety in jeopardy by cutting off power to the units.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-substation-cuts-off-power-line-to-occupied-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-kyiv-says/	2024-10-01T01:29:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1240274985.jpg
Ukraine's defense minister requests dismissal of 3 deputies, state secretary	Defense Minister Rustem Umerov signed a submission to Ukraine&apos;s government on the dismissal of three of his deputies and the state secretary, he announced on Oct. 1. Umerov called the system of the Defense Ministry, including the Armed Forces, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR), and State Transport Special Service &#xA0;&quot;a closed perimeter&quot; during martial law. &quot;This means that all processes inside must be clear and controlled. Any attempt to influence them, whether external or internal, is unacceptable. In this context, personnel changes are taking place,&quot; Umerov said in a post on Facebook, without elaborating on the reason for the reshuffle. Umerov&apos;s deputies Oleksandr Serhii, Yurii Dzhygyr as well as Defense Ministry&apos;s State Secretary Liudmyla Darahan were requested to be dismissed. Another Deputy Defense Minister Stanislav Haider is going to be transferred to the position of the head of the Minister&apos;s Office. It is now up to Ukraine&apos;s Cabinet to approve the dismissals. It was not announced who would replace them, if approved. Umerov is also planning to reform Ukraine&apos;s defense acquisition system, he said. Supervisory boards are to be set up for the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) and the State Rear Operator (DOT) &quot;in the near future,&quot; the minister said. The defense procurement sector was reshaped in December 2023, aiming to meet NATO standards. The DPA, first established in August 2022, was to focus solely on lethal aid. Meanwhile, the DOT was formed to purchase non-lethal aid like food and clothing. In addition, &quot;Spetstechnoexport&quot; (STE), Ukrainian state foreign trade enterprise, is being transferred from HUR to the Defense Ministry. The STE specializes in the export and import of military equipment and services, development of innovations, and establishment of defense-technical cooperation with Western countries and foreign companies.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-defense-minister-requests/	2024-10-01T00:42:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1648100666-1.webp

A real myth' — Trump's Ukraine peace plan rubbished by former national security advisor	A former national security advisor to Donald Trump has rubbished the Republican presidential candidate&apos;s claims that he will be able to broker a peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow and end the war in Ukraine. Speaking to CBS&#x2019;s Face the Nation on Sept. 29, HR McMaster dismissed his former boss&apos;s claims as &quot;a real myth,&quot; adding: &quot;It&#x2019;s a real misunderstanding of war &#x2014; to assume that you can get a favorable political outcome without a favorable military outcome. &quot;That&#x2019;s never really happened in war.&quot; Trump has promised to end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine within a day if elected but has not publicly elaborated on how he plans to achieve that. One plan reportedly involves ceding territory to Russia. Even the Kremlin has voiced skepticism of Trump&apos;s claims, saying on July 18 there was a need to &quot;be realistic.&quot; &quot;I don&#x2019;t really buy it,&quot; McMaster said, adding the only way that Ukraine can end up with &quot;a favorable settlement&quot; is to ensure that Russian President Vladimir Putin is in a situation where he is convinced that he is losing the war. &quot;How do you do that? You demonstrate our resolve to continue to support the Ukrainians as they defend themselves against this continued onslaught by the Russians,&quot; McMaster said. &quot;That&#x2019;s how you get to &#x2014; maybe &#x2014; favorable conditions for negotiation.&quot; In July, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Trump should reveal his plan so Kyiv can be prepared for any risks such a plan might entail. &quot;If Trump knows how to finish this war, he should tell us today,&quot; Zelensky told Bloomberg Television in an interview published on July 3. &quot;If there are risks to Ukrainian independence, if we lose statehood &#x2014; we want to be ready for this, we want to know... We want to understand whether in November we will have the powerful support of the U.S., or will be all alone.&quot; Trump and Zelensky met in the U.S. last week where the presidential candidate said that he had &quot;learned a lot&quot; as the war continues but noted that his views on ending it &quot;as soon as possible&quot; have not changed. Recently, Trump&apos;s rhetoric toward Zelensky and U.S. support for Ukraine has become increasingly critical. He has claimed that Zelensky wants Democrats to win the upcoming presidential election, referring to him as &quot;the greatest salesman on earth.&quot; Trump also criticized Zelensky earlier in September for refusing to &quot;make a deal&quot; with Russia and accused him of &quot;making little nasty aspersions&quot; toward him. But in an interview with The Washington Post published on Sept. 30, Trump said that he &quot;likes&quot; Zelensky and that he &quot;had a good relationship&quot; with him while in office.	https://kyivindependent.com/a-real-myth-trumps-ukraine-peace-plan-rubbished-by-former-national-security-advisor/	2024-09-30T23:46:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-871121864.jpg
Ukraine doesn't need US permission to strike back at Russia with homemade weapons, State Department says	Ukraine can use domestically-produced weapons to hit targets inside Russia, and does not need U.S. permission to do so, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said at a briefing on Sept. 30. Kyiv has repeatedly promised it would not attack Russian territory with long-range weapons provided by Western allies without official approval. In turn, Ukraine has carried out successful attacks on targets inside Russia with homemade arms, namely long-range drones. Over the past year, Ukraine has destroyed or damaged over 200 military facilities in Russia using &quot;drone swarm&quot; technology, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said last month. According to Miller, Kyiv can use &quot;many&quot; domestically-made weapons, and has &quot;an enormous amount of material to defend itself.&quot; Ukraine is also hoping for permission to use Western-supplied long-range missiles that it already possesses to strike military targets located deep inside Russian territory. Anticipation had been high last month ahead of meetings between President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Washington, but no announcement on a decision was made. When asked why Washington could not allow Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied weapons to strike back, the spokesperson said that the White House considers all capabilities, tactics and support for Ukraine comprehensively. &quot;When we approve any new weapon system or any new tactic, we look at how it&#x2019;s going to affect the entire battlefield and Ukraine&#x2019;s entire strategy. &#xA0;And that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;ll continue to do,&quot; he added. &quot;And if you look at the weapons we&apos;ve provided them, we&apos;ve made it very clear that they can use them to retaliate against Russian targets across the border that are conducting attacks. &quot;We are always looking to see if there are additional tools we can provide them.&quot; In late August, Umerov submitted to senior U.S. officials a list of targets that Ukraine wants to hit with U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles in Russia, which included airfields used by the Russian army to launch strikes against population centers across Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-does-not-need-us-permission-to-strike-back-at-russia-has-homemade-arms-mill/	2024-09-30T23:20:59-07:00	https://kyivindependent-01.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1257319595.jpg
Ukraine faces 'very challenging' situation on front lines, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Ukraine faces a &quot;very challenging&quot; situation on the front lines, adding that &quot;everything that can be done this fall, everything we can achieve, we must achieve.&quot; Speaking during his daily address on Sept. 30, Zelensky said he had held more than two-and-a-half hours of talks with Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi and Chief of the General Staff Anatolii Barhylevych that day. &quot;The situation is very challenging,&quot; Zelensky said, adding: &quot;The most important thing is to put pressure on Russia using all available means and tools to achieve our goal of a real and just peace for Ukraine and all our people as soon as possible.&quot; Russia continues to press forward on its offensives across the eastern front, primarily on the Pokrovsk, Vuhledar, and Toretsk axes in Donetsk Oblast, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are forced to withdraw little by little. Russian troops also appear to be preparing for assault operations in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where &quot;the enemy is amassing personnel,&quot; the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command spokesman Vladyslav Voloshyn said on Sept. 28. &quot;These are such signs of preparation for the fact that in the near future, assault actions will be carried out in the Zaporizhzhia direction,&quot; Voloshyn said, though stressing that it would require larger forces for a full-blown offensive. The spokesman suggested that the potential operation may be Russia&apos;s attempt at improving its tactical position in the area, but &#x201C;there is no talk of an offensive yet.&#x201D; The village of Pryiutne lies about 40 kilometers west of Vuhledar, a mining town that Russian troops have been trying to seize for more than two years. Russia has scaled up its offensive on Vuhledar in August, slowly gaining ground to encircle the town. The defense of Vuhledar is strategic as capturing the town would allow Moscow to form the southern flank, which is needed as a staging ground for a bigger push onto Pokrovsk &#x2013; a crucial Ukrainian-controlled logistic hub in the Donbas. Zelensky highlighted the upcoming leader-level meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Germany in October as being critical for the future course of the war. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group is the U.S.-led group consisting of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The last Ramstein meeting on Sept. 6 was the group&apos;s 24th gathering since its establishment in April 2022. &quot;This will be a special Ramstein,&quot; Zelensky said, adding: &quot;And our partners will receive all the details and arguments from our side on how to ensure results in the coming months both at the front and in diplomatic work. &quot;The power of weapons and the power of diplomacy are always effective when working together, and this is exactly our plan &#x2014; this is exactly how we should implement the victory plan. &quot;We are also expecting concrete actions from our partners to strengthen our strategy. This applies to all our partners &#x2014; our strength lies in the fact that the free world is defending itself.&quot; Zelensky presented his five-point victory plan to his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden at the White House on Sept. 26. He also discussed it with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris and members of Congress. The plan includes military and diplomatic components, including Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO, but the full details of the peace framework have not yet been publicized. The goal of the plan is to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s future negotiating position and push Russia to make a just peace, Kyiv has said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-faces-very-challenging-situation-on-front-lines-zelensky-says/	2024-09-30T22:55:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173844192.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 654,430 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 654,430 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 1. This number includes 1,370 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 8,883 tanks, 17,547 armored fighting vehicles, 25,621 vehicles and fuel tanks, 18,855 artillery systems, 1,204 multiple launch rocket systems, 963 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 328 helicopters, 16,322 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-653-060-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022-2/	2024-09-30T22:17:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166820533.jpg
Reversing recent rhetoric, Trump says he 'likes' Zelensky	Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with The Washington Post published on Sept. 30 that he &quot;likes&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky and that he &quot;had a good relationship&quot; with him while in office. Recently, Trump&apos;s rhetoric toward Zelensky and U.S. support for Ukraine has become more critical. He has claimed that Zelensky wants Democrats to win the upcoming presidential election, referring to him as &quot;the greatest salesman on earth.&quot; Trump also criticized Zelensky earlier in September for refusing to &quot;make a deal&quot; with Russia and accused him of &quot;making little nasty aspersions&quot; toward him. But following the in-person meeting between the two in New York City on Sept. 27, Trump appears to have reversed course &#x2014; at least temporarily &#x2014; as he praised Zelensky for allegedly not helping investigators with the probe that led to Trump&apos;s first impeachment trial in 2019. Repeating similar comments made at a joint press conference in advance of their meeting, Trump told the Washington Post that he liked Zelensky &quot;because during the impeachment hoax&#x2026;he could have said he didn&apos;t know the (conversation) was taped&#x2026;But instead of grandstanding and saying, &apos;Yes, I felt threatened,&apos; he said, &apos;He did absolutely nothing wrong.&apos;&quot; The impeachment trial was centered around a phone call between the two in 2019 in which Trump was accused of withholding military aid as a means of pressuring Zelensky to investigate President Joe Biden&apos;s son Hunter Biden. At the time, Zelensky said the phone call was &quot;normal.&quot; Later, as the investigation gathered steam, Zelensky said, &quot;I&apos;m sorry, but I don&apos;t want to be involved&quot; in U.S. elections. Trump has similarly thanked Zelensky in the past for keeping his distance from the impeachment investigation. The Washington Post also asked Trump for clarification on comments he had made in July 2023, in which he claimed that he would give Ukraine &quot;more than they ever got&quot; if Russian President Vladimir Putin rejected Trump&apos;s peace deal. &quot;I did say that, so I can say it to you. But I did say that and nobody picked it up. They don&apos;t because it makes so much sense,&quot; Trump responded, apparently without elaborating further. Trump has repeatedly claimed that he would end the war within 24 hours if elected but has declined to specify exactly how he plans to do so. After his recent meeting with Zelensky, Trump said that he had &quot;learned a lot&quot; as the war continues but noted that his views on ending it &quot;as soon as possible&quot; have not changed.	https://kyivindependent.com/reversing-recent-rhetoric-trump-says-he-likes-zelensky/	2024-09-30T20:23:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173922474.jpg
Russia plans more than 25% increase of funding for Putin, presidential administration	Russia is planning a 25.6% increase in its funding for President Vladimir Putin and his presidential administration, according to a draft budget for 2025 published on Sept. 30. Expenses for Putin and the presidential administration will increase to 30.9 billion rubles ($332 million). The bulk of the expenses &#x2014; 21 billion rubles ($235 million) are earmarked for an increase in salaries for the president and his staff. Other expenses will be directed toward purchasing goods for Putin and the staff of the administration, which numbers some 2,000 people. With no immediate end to the full-scale war in Ukraine in sight, the Russian government will also increase defense spending to 13.2 trillion rubles ($142 billion) in 2025 from a projected 10.4 trillion rubles ($111 billion) in 2024. In contrast, social spending is expected to amount to 7.7 trillion rubles ($87 billion), or 21.1% of the Russian budget in 2024. The figure will further drop in 2025, with 6.49 trillion rubles ($69 billion) allocated for social spending in 2025, accounting for 15.7% of total expenses. Economists have predicted that Russia is on track for an intense economic slowdown due to significant labor shortages and constraints placed on the key sectors that have historically backed growth. In February 2024, U.S. intelligence estimated that since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Russia has spent up to $211 billion on military operations in Ukraine. The war has also cost Russia up to $1.3 trillion in lost economic growth through 2026, an undisclosed source in U.S. intelligence told Reuters.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-plans-30-boost-in-defense-spending-25-increase-for-putin-presidential-administration/	2024-09-30T19:07:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172350481.jpg
Russia sentences man to life in prison for car bomb attack that wounded pro-war writer	A court in Moscow sentenced a man to life in prison on Sept. 30 for a car bomb attack in May 2023 that seriously wounded Russian pro-war writer and former fighter Zakhar Prilepin. Russian state-run media have claimed that the convict Alexander Permyakov has both Ukrainian and Russian citizenship and further alleged that he acted on behalf of Kyiv &#x2014; with the support of the U.S. Prilepin was sanctioned in 2022 by Ukraine, the EU, the U.K., and Canada for supporting Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. He joined Russia&apos;s National Guard to fight against Ukraine in January 2023, according to several Russian media reports. Previously, Prilepin fought with Russian proxy fighters in Donetsk Oblast between 2016 and 2018 and regularly speaks out in favor of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The car bomb attack occurred in the Russian city of Nizhny Novgorod and resulted in both of Prilepin&apos;s legs being broken, among other injuries. It also killed Prilepin&apos;s driver. Russian state-run media claimed that Permyakov confessed to the attack after his arrest, and alleged that he had been recruited by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and promised $20,000 as payment. The SBU has not confirmed or denied its involvement in the attack, but the Atesh partisan group claimed responsibility for carrying it out. There is no way to independently verify the validity of Permyakov&apos;s alleged confession. Russia does not provide transparent access to its legal system, and international human rights organizations have long detailed rampant abuse in prisons, as well as the use of torture to coerce confessions. A number of Russian propagandists, proxy officials, and other pro-war figures have been targeted for alleged assassinations, some of which have been successful, in both occupied territories of Ukraine and in Russia itself. In April 2023, an explosion in a cafe in downtown St. Petersburg killed Russian propagandist Vladlen Tatarsky and injured a dozen others.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-sentences-man-to-life-in-prison-for-car-bomb-attack-that-wounded-pro-war-writer/	2024-09-30T17:57:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-933568448.jpg
Jamala's documentary honored with Gold Dolphin at Cannes Corporate Media & TV Awards	The Ukrainian documentary &quot;Jamala. Songs of Freedom&quot; won the Gold Dolphin at the Cannes Corporate Media &amp; TV Awards, in the Human Concerns and Social Issues category. &quot;I&apos;m reading this and I can&apos;t believe it... Out of almost 800 applications from 46 countries, the Cannes jury selected this particular film,&quot; Jamala posted on Facebook. The documentary focuses on her work and support for Ukraine at the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. &quot;This film is about us... about these three years of losses, pain, suffering, and our desperate fight for freedom,&quot; Jamala said. The singer previously gained international recognition by winning the 2016 Eurovision Song Contest with her song 1944, about the deportation of Crimean Tatars. Her family, like that of Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, was deported to Central Asia in 1944 by the Soviet authorities on the false accusation that all Crimean Tatars had collaborated with the Nazis. Up to 200,000 Crimean Tatars &#x2013; mostly women, children, and the elderly &#x2013; were deported to Central Asia and Siberia, while Crimean Tatar men who were fighting for the Red Army at the time were sent to labor camps.In the 1980s, Jamala and her family returned to Crimea, where she went on to study in Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/jamalas-documentary-honored-with-gold-dolphin-at-cannes-corporate-media-tv-awards/	2024-09-30T16:09:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/Jamala.jpg
Lithuania urges ICC probe into crimes of Lukashenko regime	Lithuania has formally requested the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate crimes against humanity committed by the regime of Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko. This appeal focuses on offenses primarily carried out since May 2020, when the Lukashenko regime started to increasingly target civilians through deportation and persecute political opponents. Lithuania&apos;s Ministry of Justice asserts that these actions represent a systematic attack on dissent in Belarus, aligned with state policy. &quot;The request for justice - emanating from the victims themselves - must not go unanswered,&quot; said Aarif Abraham, Counsel to the Lithuanian Government before the ICC. One specific charge is the forced relocation of thousands of Belarusian citizens to neighboring countries, including Lithuania. Despite Belarus not being a party to the Rome Statute, the ICC has jurisdiction due to crimes committed on the territories of participating nations. Lithuania, which previously succeeded in bringing charges against Russian President Vladimir Putin, now seeks an arrest warrant for Lukashenko. Unrest in Belarus began in 2020 after contested presidential elections, with widespread protests and international sanctions following Lukashenko&#x2019;s disputed re-election. When an upswell of support made it obvious that opposition candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya was heading for victory, Lukashenko falsified the results, awarding himself over 80% of the vote. More than 1,000 political prisoners have been given decade-plus prison sentences, and 1,500 others have been jailed for protesting against the war in Ukraine, including by sabotaging railroads to impede the Russian army.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-urges-icc-probe-into-crimes-of-lukashenko-regime/	2024-09-30T14:33:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2162854097.jpg
Russia plans to start exporting coal from occupied Donbas in October, proxy leader claims	The Russian company Donskoy Ugol Trading House is planning to start exporting coal from the occupied Donbas region through the port of Mariupol in October, the Russian state-controlled media outlet RBC reported on Sept. 30, citing Andey Chertkov, a Russian proxy leader operating in occupied Donetsk Oblast. Russia has occupied Crimea and part of the eastern Donbas region since the start of its aggression in 2014. The city of Mariupol in Donetsk Oblast came under siege by Russian forces between February and May 2022, leaving thousands dead and reducing Mariupol to rubble. According to authorities&apos; rough estimates, at least 25,000 people could have been killed. The exact number remains unknown and could be much higher. Donskoy Ugol Trading House&apos;s CEO, Oleg Knyazev, claimed that negotiations on coal supplies from the Donbas region are ongoing with potential buyers from China, India, Iran, Uzbekistan, and Malaysia. Exports could pass through the ports of Russian-occupied Mariupol, Russian cities Taganrog and Rostov-on-Don, and by rail through Azerbaijan and Iran, RBC said, citing its undisclosed source familiar with the company&apos;s plans. Donskoy Ugol Trading House was founded in 2020 in Rostov-on-Don, Russia. From 2020 to 2023, Vitaliy Donchenko and Aleksandr Maslyuk owned the company. They were sanctioned by Ukraine in 2021. In 2024, Donskoy Ugol Trading House leased 10 coal mines from Russian proxies in Luhansk Oblast. Some of these mines previously belonged to the Ukrainian metallurgical company Metinvest, controlled by Ukraine&apos;s richest man, Rinat Akhmetov.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-plans-to-start-exporting-coal-from-occupied-donbas-in-october-proxy-leader-claims/	2024-09-30T13:35:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/coal.jpg
The most downloaded book summary app is from Ukraine, and it wants to change how you read	Editor&#x2019;s note: This article is part of a series of profiles highlighting successful Ukrainian startups and businesses. The series is funded by the regional investment fund Ukraine-Moldova American Enterprise Fund (UMAEF) and created in partnership with Spend With Ukraine, a non-profit organization that launched a platform to showcase businesses with Ukrainian roots and provide one more meaningful way to support Ukraine &#x2013; by choosing to spend with Ukraine. The series&#x2019; sponsors are not involved in the editorial process of the writing of these profiles. Anton Pavlovsky loved reading growing up, but going through the last turbulent 30 or so years of Ukraine&#x2019;s independent history &#x2014; the difficult 90s, the 2004 Orange Revolution then the 2014 EuroMaidan Revolution, war, and economic difficulties &#x2014; he virtually stopped reading. But after going through a divorce, he found books to be a source of solace. &#x201C;My divorce propelled me into this mode of reflection over what went wrong, what happened and why, and I started reading a lot,&#x201D; founde and CEO Pavlovsky told the Kyiv Independent. While reading he stumbled across a question that particularly affected him &#x2014; &#x201C;What would you do with your life if you were guaranteed success and happiness?&#x201D; Pavlovsky answered the question to himself in the notes app on his computer that he still has from the day he wrote it on Dec. 17, 2018: &quot;I would work on a platform that allowed individuals to educate themselves, educate others, be a role model. A platform that will spread enlightenment.&quot; Three weeks later, the Headway book summary app was born. The app now has a collection of over 1,500 books in English, condensed and summarized with key points that take anywhere from a few minutes to 15 minutes to read or listen to. The company is already working on including Spanish and French books to its repertoire. Since its inception, the app has gone on to become the most downloaded book summary apps in application stores, with around 40 million downloads. The company has also developed four other micro-learning products with a fifth in development, including its &#x201C;brain training&#x201D; app, Impulse, which has been downloaded around 70 million times since 2018. It has also been featured on several ratings and lists as a future unicorn in Ukraine. &#xA0; Headway was founded and to this day operates out of its Kyiv office located in the historic, industrial Podil neighborhood, home to both IT companies and techno clubs. The company relocated many employees out of Kyiv at the onset of the full-scale invasion, but most have since returned. The company has grown 100 times since it was founded, and now counts over 300 employees, a large part of which works in Ukraine. Headway Team in 2022 in an unknown location. (Headway)Pavlovsky told the Kyiv Independent that concentrating books into shorter versions of themselves and offering their highlights isn&#x2019;t about getting people to read less, but more. If people aren&#x2019;t reading anyway &#xA0;&#x2014; in 2023, 46% of adults in the U.S., Headway&#x2019;s largest market, surveyed said they had finished zero books &#x2014; might as well give them some way of interacting with the written word, the thinking goes. &#x201C;Books are great, I love books, but other people may not love them and that&#x2019;s fine, we will provide them with other means to learn in this age of distraction, on the go, gamified, whenever they have like two, five, 10 minutes to spare.&#x201D; The Headway app tries to get people to learn with a variety of options for the busiest of us who can&#x2019;t find more than a few minutes to spare to those who have at least 15 minutes to get away from all of life&#x2019;s daily distractions. One may also want to brush up on a book they read 10 years ago, or see if a book is interesting enough to actually buy it. The app&#x2019;s homepage offers &#x201C;daily microlearning sessions,&#x201D; that allows to &#x201C;tap through 10 bits of knowledge in three minutes.&#x201D; Each bit of knowledge is one line from books ranging in topics from spirituality to how to transform your business and become a seven-figure entrepreneur.

The app tracks your progress and sends you notifications to remind you to keep up the good work. An illustration of the Headway app (Headway)Getting the attention of a population that according to one study has an average attention span of eight seconds &#x2014; one second less than that of a goldfish &#x2014; is one of the goals of companies like Headway. &#xA0; &#x201C;All this distraction and not enough time &#x2014; you have to keep up with so much, the need is there,&#x201D; Pavlovksy said. So is the potential. The global education market is currently valued at $6 trillion and is expected to hit $8 trillion by 2030, according to Morgan Stanley Research from 2023. The sector is notorious for being under-digitalized, and according to Pavlovsky, especially when it comes to our phones. Constantly in our hands, Headway and others like it want us to &#x201C;better utilize the capabilities of that kind of device that&#x2019;s always with you,&#x201D; Pavlovsky said. It&#x2019;s also about democratizing access to information &#x2014; many people around the world don&#x2019;t have access to top-level education, but most of them have phones. The market opportunities may mostly be outside of Ukraine, but Headway, being founded and located in Ukraine, the country, and its struggles are never too far away. For one, the app&#x2019;s icon features the blue and yellow of Ukraine&#x2019;s flag. After the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, it launched its &#x201C;Essence of Ukraine&#x201D; series which offers free-of-charge summaries of books about Ukraine and its history. But simply by being such a successful example of a Ukrainian-born and based company, Headway is also changing the persisting negative stereotypes of Ukrainian business as behind or corrupt. &#x201C;I&apos;m sure that Ukraine will prove to the world and it has already proven that it can create number one products, winning products, winning businesses at some point even new business models,&#x201D; Pavlovsky said.

Far-right Freedom Party wins Austrian elections, further cementing Russia-friendly wall in Central Europe	Austrians went to the polls on Sept. 29, handing the victory to the far-right, anti-migration Freedom Party (FPO). The party gained 29% of the vote, its best result to date. Founded by SS Major General Anton Reinthaller in 1956, the party has long been climbing into the country&apos;s mainstream, taking part in three right-wing governments as a junior coalition partner, most recently in 2017. Under the current leadership of Herbert Kickl, a controversial figure in Austrian politics, the party supported lifting sanctions imposed against Russia. Kickl has also repeatedly spoken against providing Ukraine with military aid, arguing that Austria&apos;s policy of neutrality should be preserved. Kickl said he was willing to seek chancellorship, and would serve as a &quot;Volkskanzler&quot; or &quot;Chancellor of the People&quot; &#x2013; a term used in Nazi German to refer to Adolf Hitler in the 1930s. The results mark the latest win for the far-right, Kremlin-friendly parties in Central Europe. The Austrian election came just weeks after Ukraine-skeptic parties made gains in state elections in eastern Germany and a year after Robert Fico won Slovakia&apos;s election on an anti-Ukraine, populist platform. As the election results became clear, the FPO&apos;s victory was lauded by the far-right across the continent, such as Alice Wiedel, who heads Germany&apos;s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, and Geert Wilders, the leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV). French far-right leader Marine Le Pen said she was &quot;delighted&quot; with the FPO&apos;s win, while Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban congratulated Kickl, posting on social media that the results were &quot;another win for the patriots.&quot; FPO is part of a grouping in the European Parliament called Patriots for Europe, formed in June 2024 by Kickl, Orban, and former Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis.

The grouping went on to win 84 seats in the 720-seat European Parliament. The FPO&apos;s gains at Austria&apos;s legislative level are &quot;worrying,&quot; Andreas Umland, an analyst at the Stockholm Centre for Eastern European Studies, told the Kyiv Independent. There are now three neighboring countries, namely Austria, Hungary, and Slovakia, where a Ukraine-skeptic party has become the largest political force. These parties could be characterized as &quot;pro-Russian, either ideologically or strategically,&quot; Umland said. The far-right parties across Europe differ in terms of ideology, but they are united by the one shared belief that Kyiv should not receive military support, Sebastian Schaffer, the director of the Vienna-based Institute for the Danube Region and Central Europe, told the Kyiv Independent. Their rhetoric follows typical Kremlin narratives, such as needing peace above all else and that supporting Ukraine prolongs the war, Schaffer said. In Austria, however, neutrality is a particularly important topic. Austrians value the narrative of their own post-World War II neutrality to such an extent that it&apos;s practically &quot;become a myth in itself,&quot; according to Schaffer. Austria is not a member of NATO, and a poll in May 2023 showed that 60% of Austrians are against becoming a member of the alliance. The poll also found that 21% of Austrians considered EU support for Ukraine in the face of Russia&apos;s invasion &quot;not important at all.&quot; While the FPO primarily campaigned on an anti-immigration platform, the party has long presented itself as the political force that will ensure Austria&apos;s &quot;neutrality&quot; in the face of threats to global security. FPO lawmakers left the Austrian parliament building in March 2023 when President Volodymyr Zelensky came to give a speech, showing signs advocating for &quot;peace&quot; and &quot;neutrality.&quot; &quot;We are neither on the Russian nor the Ukrainian side,&quot; Kickl said, referring to FPO MPs as &quot;neutrality advocates.&quot; The FPO&apos;s track record suggests otherwise. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Kickl has opposed military aid to Kyiv and Ukraine&apos;s accession to the EU and argued sanctions against Russia do more harm to Austria than good. In 2016, the FPO became the first and only party in Europe to sign a partnership agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s United Russia party. In 2018, Kickl visited Moscow while holding the position of Austrian Interior Minister. Although Kickl claimed in 2021 that the partnership agreement with United Russia had expired, Schaffer believes the ties between the FPO and Russia remain intact. The first interview that Kickl gave following the vote was not to the Austrian state broadcaster but to a new local outlet called Auf Einz, which describes itself as &quot;alternative, independent television.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s one of the worst conspiracy theory-spinning media that is out there,&quot; Schaffer said. &quot;It&apos;s fairly clear that they need money to exist.&quot; &quot;I would bet almost all my savings that this is being funded through the channels that date back to the partnership agreement,&quot; Schaffer said. &quot;I think they are continuing to cooperate.&quot; If proven, it would not be the first case of a Moscow-backed media network seeking to influence European politics. In March, the Czech authorities announced Viktor Medvedchuk, a Kremlin-linked former Ukrainian oligarch, and Artem Marchevskyi, a media manager who used to work at one of Medvedchuk&apos;s TV channels, were behind an outlet called Voice of Europe. Voice of Europe reportedly centered around the promotion of pro-Russian narratives and paying Kremlin-friendly politicians ahead of the European Parliament elections. The question remains whether the FPO will be able to influence Austria&apos;s policies toward Ukraine on a legislative level. With a projected 56 seats in a 183-seat parliament, the FPO will have to form a coalition in order to rule. &quot;I think the FPO will not become a governmental party, as far as I have understood,&quot; Umland said. &quot;There will most probably be a coalition of the other parties against the FPO, like what we see in the regional parliaments in eastern Germany.&quot; &quot;There, the AfD is the strongest, but other parties have teamed up to exclude them,&quot; Umland said. In the same way, mainstream Austrian party leaders have already signaled they are opposed to forming a government with the FPO. The ruling center-right Austrian People&apos;s Party came second with 26% of the vote, while the Social Democrats, who are firmly against the FPO, came third with 21%. The two parties have enough seats to form a coalition. The liberal NEOS party and the Greens were also able to gain seats, and have also ruled out working with FPO. Kickl said he is open to forming a government with &quot;each and every one&quot; of the parties in Austria&apos;s parliament. It&apos;s unlikely that anyone would agree.	https://kyivindependent.com/far-right-freedom-party-wins-austrian-elections-cementing-further-cementing-russia-friendly-wall-in-central-europe/	2024-09-30T13:15:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174750606.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia aims to draft 133,000 men during new round of fall conscription	Key developments on Sept. 30: Russia is planning to draft 133,000 Russians between October and January, according to a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin on Sept. 30. Men aged from 18 to 30 will be drafted as part of the regularly occurring fall conscription campaign. The decree applies to Russians who are not in the reserve and are subject to military service. Those soldiers whose service has already expired are to be dismissed. The fall 2023 conscription included the illegally annexed areas of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. The U.K. Defense Ministry said in March that Russia is likely recruiting around 30,000 people a month to help bolster its war effort. Ukraine also adopted a law on mobilization in April as part of an effort to replenish the ranks of the Armed Forces. The need to increase the number of troops persists as Russia continues to advance in Donetsk Oblast and Ukraine after opened a new front in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Recent legislation reforms pertaining to mobilization also included a law lowering the minimum age of compulsory military service from 27 to 25. After the law came into force in Ukraine on May 18, military-aged men were given 60 days to update their personal data so that the state could locate them. Between May 18 and the mid-July deadline, over 4.6 million military-aged men had done so, the country&apos;s Defense Ministry said. Russian troops are using &quot;the maximum range of weapons&quot; to attack the recently recaptured aggregate plant in the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Kharkiv Group of Forces spokesperson Vitalii Sarantsev said on Sept. 30. Describing the situation as &quot;difficult,&quot; Sarantsev said Russian forces were continuously assaulting in the Kharkiv sector, and had made the Vovchansk plant its &quot;number one goal.&quot; Russian troops had been in control of the facility for several months before it was recaptured by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) special forces on Sept. 24, HUR previously reported. &quot;(The plant) is not a tactical target as such for (Russia). But at the same time, the loss of this facility was a very powerful blow to its image,&quot; the spokesperson said. Speaking on national television, Sarantsev said that Russian forces are carrying out attacks against the plant with guided aerial bombs and &quot;Solntsepek&quot; multiple rocket launchers. &quot;In other words, (Russia) is following its standard practice of destroying what it could not capture,&quot; he added. Ukrainian forces captured around 20 Russian soldiers and killed &quot;several dozen&quot; others during an operation to recapture an aggregate plant in the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, a member of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) claimed last week. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. Vovchansk is an embattled town some 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Kharkiv that has seen heavy battles since Russia launched a new offensive in the area in May. While initially gaining ground, the Russian offensive in northern Kharkiv Oblast has quickly bogged down, with Russian troops reportedly suffering heavy losses. The intensity of fighting has decreased somewhat compared to other sectors in Ukraine&apos;s east near Pokrovsk, Vuhledar, and Toretsk. Colonel Ivan Vinnik, commander of Ukraine&apos;s 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade currently defending the embattled town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, has been transferred, the brigade confirmed on Sept. 29. According to Operational Command &quot;North,&quot; Vinnik was transferred &quot;for the purpose of promotion and to transfer combat experience.&quot; It was not announced who would replace him. Vinnik was appointed commander of the 72nd Brigade in August 2022. Under his command, the brigade has defended Vuhledar for more than two years. Russian forces have been trying to capture the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. &quot;Since the summer of 2022 till today, I have had a long and difficult journey. But it was not difficult, because I did not overcome it alone. I had a loyal and motivated team by my side,&quot; Vinnik said in a post on Facebook. &quot;I thank each and every one of you for your patience, willpower and strength. Thank you for listening, hearing, talking and offering suggestions. Thank you for our joint struggle. &quot;Thank you for being by my side. I really appreciate it! I am honoured to be a part of the Black Cossacks, and the bond that has been formed between us will remain forever.&quot; The reshuffle comes at a time when fierce fighting for Vuhledar is still ongoing. The front-line town lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Russian troops had not reached the outskirts of Vuhledar as of Sept. 25, Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin. A day later, the brigade refuted reports that it was retreating from the town and released a video from the town. The crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState claimed on Sept. 29 that Russian troops trying to gain a foothold in high-rise buildings on the outskirts of Vuhledar. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. &quot;The loss of Vuhledar would be not only a morale blow for Ukraine since this city has resisted plenty of assaults since 2022, but also a very serious development that can potentially threaten the security of the entire southwestern portion of Donetsk Oblast not yet occupied, along with the threat to Pokrovsk&apos;s southern flank,&quot; Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent earlier this month. President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s victory plan will be made public but some parts will remain secret, the head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak said on Sept. 29. Zelensky presented the five-point victory plan to his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden at the White House on Sept. 26. He also discussed it with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris and members of Congress. The plan includes military and diplomatic components, including Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO, but the full details of the peace framework have not yet been publicized. The goal of the plan is to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s future negotiating position and push Russia to make a just peace, Kyiv has said. Speaking on national TV, Yermak said the plan will be presented to Ukrainians without some &quot;sensitive&quot; details to prevent information from leaking to Russia. &quot;Everything that becomes public is heard not only in our country, but also by the enemy. That is why some details of this plan are classified. But it is important to see the implementation of this plan on enemy territory,&quot; he added. While Zelensky was in the U.S. last week, reports emerged that the White House was concerned the plan lacks a clear strategy to win against Russia. Following the visit to the U.S., presidential spokesperson Serhii Nykyforov said that Washington took the plan &quot;constructively.&quot; Kyiv was targeted by several waves of Russian attack drones overnight, city authorities said on Sept. 30. Air raid sirens sounded in the capital just after 1 a.m., with the all clear not being given until just after 6 a.m. As air defenses engaged the drones, Kyiv Independent correspondents heard multiple explosions, anti-aircraft fire, and the sound of unmanned aerial vehicles flying overhead in at least one district of the city. Shortly before 5 a.m., Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said several drones were &quot;over and near the capital,&quot; adding: &quot;Stay in shelters!&quot; No damage or casualties were reported, though Klitschko said the wreckage of one drone was found near a residential building in Kyiv&apos;s Obolon district. &quot;All Russian attack drones that threatened Kyiv were neutralized,&quot; Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said in a post on Telegram, adding several waves had attacked the city from different directions. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force later said Russian forces had launched 73 Shahed-type drones against cities across Ukraine overnight, 67 of which were intercepted. It did not specify how many had attacked Kyiv. Russian drone attacks on Kyiv have stepped up in recent weeks &#x2014; overnight on Sept. 26, more than 15 drones were spotted near the capital, with around 10 of them downed by air defenses, the Kyiv City Military Administration said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-aims-to-draft-133-000-during-new-round-of-fall-conscription/	2024-09-30T13:03:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1253226504.jpg
Recurring failures to launch Satan ICBM throw shadow on Putin's nuclear saber-rattling	Years back, Russia began the development of several new strategic weapons, as Russian President Vladimir Putin had called them, to modernize the country&#x2019;s military and give it an edge against the so-called West, a conflict that was in full swing. Among them was the RS-28 Sarmat ICBM, known as Satan II. Following the start of the full-scale war, the missile was officially operational, according to Russian state officials. In late September, however, an explosion crater, roughly 60 meters wide at the Yubileynaya silo launch site at the Russian cosmodrome Plesetsk in the town of Mirny, showed that official statements were most likely an exaggeration. Although the Kremlin has denied that it conducted ICBM test launches, the satellite imagery of the launch site showed an explosion that was linked to the Sarmat missile. If confirmed, this would be the fourth failed Sarmat launch. &quot;The (RS-28) Sarmat was supposed to enter into service six to seven years ago, and there is already quite a delay. So, I think right now, Russian decision-makers might get a bit nervous,&quot; Fabian Hoffmann, a defense expert and doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo, told the Kyiv Independent. With Ukrainian troops occupying swats of land in Russia and Ukrainian drones hitting Russian arms depots on a regular occurrence, nuclear saber-rattling was among the last leverages the Kremlin had in an attempt to cut Kyiv from Western weapons and political support. The Russian military will be able to &quot;determine the conditions&quot; for the use of nuclear weapons, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Russian state-controlled television on Sept. 29. &quot;(The military) closely monitors what weapons are used and how. They are the ones who record the direct involvement of the countries of the collective West in the (war in) Ukraine, and they will not diminish their focus,&quot; Peskov said. Following yet another failed launch, Russia&#x2019;s ability to act on its threats was questioned. Putin introduced the RS-28 Sarmat in March 2018, along with the hypersonic missile Avangard and the Kinzhal ballistic missile, which is regularly used by Russian forces to attack Ukrainian cities far from the front line. The 35-meter RS-28 Sarmat silo-based missile is intended to replace the R-36 ICBMs, which are known by the NATO reporting name of SS-18 &quot;Satan.&quot; The recent Russian development is reportedly capable of carrying up to 15 nuclear warheads and covering nearly 18,000 kilometers (11,000 miles). &quot;Each warhead reportedly has a yield of 500 kilotons. So, you get a five-megaton payload, which is quite substantial. These are independently targetable at different sites. So, I have one ICBM, and I can theoretically use that ICBM to launch 10 warheads against 10 cities,&quot; Hoffmann said. The Sarmat&apos;s initial launch phase is reportedly short, allowing little time for surveillance systems to track it. In 2022, after launching an all-out war against Ukraine, Putin said the Sarmat would &quot;reliably ensure the security of Russia from external threats and make those who, in the heat of aggressive rhetoric, try to threaten our country, think twice.&quot; Nothing had followed. Even though in September 2023, Yuri Borisov, the head of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, said the Sarmat missiles have &quot;assumed combat duty,&quot; according to Russian news agency reports, the latest test run proves otherwise. Relying only on satellite images, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the explosion, said Hans Kristensen, associate senior fellow in the SIPRI Weapons of Mass Destruction Programme. However, the expert added that to create such destruction, it seems likely that the missile exploded inside the silo. According to Hoffmann, the explosion could have been triggered by liquid fuel, which is more sensitive to stimuli than solid fuel. Meanwhile, the incident could have been prompted by other reasons as well. &quot;We don&apos;t know how desperately, but Russia is very eager to upgrade its aging silo fleet, which has not been updated since the 1980s,&quot; Hoffmann said, referring to the latest modifications of the R-36 and UR-100N ICBMs. Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin (L) chairs a meeting regarding the situation in Kursk Oblast, in his residence in Novo-Ogaryovo outside Moscow, on Aug. 12, 2024. (Gavril Grigoriov/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)Russian ICBMs and other heavy missiles have been designed and produced in modern-day Ukraine, with Sarmat being Russia&apos;s first attempt to develop a liquid-fueled ICBM. Yet Hoffman does not rule out the possibility that Russia is still using parts of its previous developments to create new ICBMs. The SS-18 Satan, the Sarmat&apos;s predecessor, was to a large port developed in Ukraine, which played a big role in maintaining these missiles until 2014 when Russia launched its war against Ukraine, Hoffman said. &quot;Then, there is a question of whether Russia was able to build up its own maintenance logistics around the missile or indeed just relying on decommissioned &#x420;-36&#x41C;s to serve as a spare powered material.&quot; The expert noted that the situation in Russian production is not known for sure, but if this is true, sooner or later, Russia will run out of parts from decommissioned ICBMs. He also does not rule out that Western sanctions may create additional pressure. &quot;This is not too good from a Russian perspective. They (Russians) really want to get this new thing out (the Sarmat) because they don&apos;t want to rely on an aging ICBM that potentially has a limited number of spare parts left that they can use,&quot; Hoffman said. Hi, this is Kateryna Hodunova, thank you for reading this article. While I was on a work trip abroad, away from my family, Russia stepped up its threats of a possible attack on the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. I would never wish anyone to go to bed every day thinking that they might not see their family or friends in the morning. I believe that our articles give a better understanding of what Ukrainians are dealing with everyday.

Energoatom orders additional protection for Rivne Nuclear Power Plant only at end of September, media reports	Ukraine&apos;s state nuclear energy agency Energoatom signed on Sept. 25 a contract worth Hr 509 million ($12.3 million) for the design and construction of a protective structure at the Rivne Nuclear Power Plant, Ukrainian investigative media outlet Nashi Groshi reported on Sept. 30. The outlet noted that the agreement was concluded only after President Volodymyr Zelensky told the U.N. Security Council on Sept. 24 that Russia was preparing to target three Ukrainian nuclear power plants and that the infrastructure around the plants was not properly protected. The protective structures around the plants include U-shaped structures that shield large transformers from drones and shrapnel damage in the event of an indirect missile hit, Nashi Groshi said. Energoatom signed the contract via Prozorro, Ukraine&apos;s electronic public procurement system, designed to increase transparency and competition in the bidding process, Nashi Groshi reported. The outlet also said that the contract itself was not published on Prozorro, so details about how many and how large the structures that are to be built under this new contract will be are unknown. For comparison, Ukrainian state grid operator Ukrenergo recently signed contracts worth Hr 98 million ($2.3 million) and Hr 120 million ($2.9 million) for structures that protect one transformer, Nashi Groshi reported. Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the former head of Ukrenergo, said in an interview with Suspilne after his recent dismissal that more than 60 of the company&apos;s facilities have these types of protective structures. According to Kudrytskyi, these structures helped Ukrenergo recover from a mass Russian attack on Aug. 26. Russia launched nine coordinated attacks against Ukraine&apos;s electricity infrastructure between March and the end of August, striking facilities in 20 oblasts. According to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter due to the attacks, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand. This summer, the power shortage was 2.5 GW when Kyiv was already experiencing long blackouts. There are three operating nuclear power plants on Ukrainian-held territory: the Rivne and Khmelnytskyi plants in the country&apos;s west and the Pivdennoukrainsk plant in the south. Russia&apos;s regular attacks cut off power to the units, putting their safety in jeopardy. According to the Energy Ministry, nuclear generation currently accounts for up to 60% of the country&apos;s electricity consumption. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe&apos;s largest nuclear power station, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/energoatom-orders-additional-protection-for-rivne-nuclear-power-plant-only-at-end-of-september/	2024-09-30T11:43:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1239680001.jpg
Belarusian military starts checking combat capability of Air Force, Air Defense	The Belarusian Defense Ministry announced on Sept. 30 a new stage of inspection of its Armed Forces&apos; military units, with a focus on the air force and air defense troops, according to the statement. The combat training tasks will involve all training areas of the Belarusian Armed Forces. During the inspection, military conscripts from the country&apos;s reserves will be called up, the ministry said. Two anti-aircraft missile and two radio-technical brigades, five anti-aircraft missile regiments, and three air bases may be involved in the inspection, according to the monitoring group Belarusian Hajun. Minsk is Moscow&apos;s closest ally and hosts Russian troops and missiles, but has so far not been directly involved in Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko said in an interview on Aug. 15 that Belarus moved a third of its army to the border with Ukraine earlier in the summer. Speaking to the Rossiya TV channel, Lukashenko claimed it was in response to a build-up of Ukrainian troops that had been prompted by a misinterpretation of preparations for Belarus&apos;s Independence Day celebrations on July 3. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry released a statement on Aug. 25 that Belarus is &quot;concentrating a significant number&quot; of weaponry and personnel at the border with Ukraine, including some former Wagner Group mercenaries. The Foreign Ministry warned, &quot;in case of a violation of Ukraine&apos;s state border by Belarus, our state will take all necessary measures to exercise the right to self-defense guaranteed by the UN Charter.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/belarusian-army-starts-checking-combat-capability-of-air-force-air-defense/	2024-09-30T09:31:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1522418745.jpg
Opinion: War risk insurance bridges the gap in Ukraine’s reconstruction	Ukraine is at a crucial turning point. As we focus on reconstruction amid ongoing Russian aggression, one aspect is pivotal to our success: war risk insurance. This tool is indispensable for attracting foreign investment and ensuring the resilience of local businesses. War risk insurance is designed to protect businesses against losses caused by military conflict, covering a wide range of risks, from physical destruction to operational disruptions. Its importance extends beyond damage recovery &#x2013; it&#x2019;s about building confidence, which is essential for both investors and businesses operating in conflict zones like Ukraine. One notable example of mitigating war risks is a collective plan with funds shared by multiple states. We all know about the Marshall Plan during World War II, which provided significant financial assistance to European countries to help rebuild their economies and infrastructure after the war. While the primary focus of the Marshall Plan was economic recovery and reducing risks of future conflict, it effectively provided a form of war risk insurance. By fostering stability and confidence, it created a favorable environment for investors and contributed to Europe&apos;s long-term recovery and growth. Several insurance programs are currently addressing war risks in Ukraine. International agencies, such as the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), have made significant strides. DFC, for example, recently announced $357 million in new political risk insurance to protect critical investments necessary for our recovery. MIGA offers coverage for foreign investors starting at $5 million, with terms lasting up to 20 years. Some international programs may not specialize in Ukraine, but they offer political and war risk insurance that includes coverage for investments in the country. However, the process for securing coverage from international agencies can be slow and bureaucratic, often taking many months. Limited available information complicates this further. This creates challenges for investors seeking confidence and swift protection, especially in high-risk areas. Despite the growing presence of international insurers, a significant gap remains &#x2013; especially for medium and high-value commercial property and for Ukrainian businesses requiring coverage exceeding $5 million. It&#x2019;s important to note that international agencies aren&#x2019;t the only ones providing war risk coverage. Local providers, such as Ukraine&#x2019;s Export Credit Agency (ECA) and private insurers like ARX and INGO, are playing an increasingly important role. ECA has made progress offering war and political risk insurance for Ukrainian businesses, covering projects up to 200 million hryvnias (about $5 million), with premiums ranging from 0.5% to 8%. However, ECA has yet to issue any significant investment insurance policies, signaling that more must be done to bridge the gap between potential and reality. Meanwhile, private insurers like ARX and Oranta are offering coverage for property damage caused by war, with premiums averaging between 1-3% of the insured amount. Their coverage limits typically cap at &#xA0;10-20 million hryvnias ($241,369-$482,738), providing a vital, albeit limited, service to small Ukrainian businesses. International stakeholders&apos; participation is critical. Organizations like USAID, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), DFC, and the European Investment Bank (EIB) are essential in overcoming the bottlenecks in war risk insurance. These organizations are uniquely positioned to offer financial and structural support to local and international insurers, enabling them to provide larger-scale coverage, faster processing times, and more flexible terms. For Ukraine, these organizations are not just partners but crucial stakeholders, whose support will directly impact the pace of recovery. High hopes are placed on their ability to work with private and state insurers to create a robust framework capable of meeting Ukraine&#x2019;s complex insurance needs. The recent appointment of the U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine&#x2019;s Economic Recovery brings new optimism. This role is expected to play a pivotal part in galvanizing international coordination on war risk insurance. By working closely with institutions like DFC and USAID, the Special Representative can help streamline processes and expand coverage &#x2013; critical steps toward unlocking more investment in Ukraine. Additionally, representatives for Ukraine&#x2019;s reconstruction have been appointed by countries such as France, Poland, Germany, Italy, and others. These appointments reflect a unified international commitment to supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s recovery. However, more countries would benefit from appointing similar representatives to enhance international coordination, streamline aid delivery, and ensure a comprehensive approach to recovery. Despite the availability of war risk insurance, coverage for medium and large-scale commercial properties remains far below what&#x2019;s needed to support Ukraine&apos;s recovery. Existing solutions, while helpful, only cover a fraction of the demand. This gap leaves businesses exposed and the market underserved, highlighting the need for more comprehensive and robust insurance offerings to fully protect investments and encourage large-scale reconstruction efforts. Expanding these services is essential for boosting investor confidence and driving sustainable economic growth in Ukraine. Ukraine is offering foreign investors the protection they need, but we must strengthen the infrastructure to back it up. Communication must also be systematic to provide transparency and confidence to everyone interested in doing business with Ukraine. War risk insurance should be seen as a core part of our reconstruction strategy, not only underwriting new investments but also safeguarding existing businesses that remain the backbone of our economy. As a member of the Ukrainian parliament and representative to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I call on our partners in Europe and the international financial community to take decisive action. It is vital that we develop and fund war risk insurance programs that allow Ukraine to unlock its full potential as a strategic economic player in Europe and the global market. Insurance programs must target large, medium, and small businesses, offering a variety of insurance products to meet diverse needs. The road ahead is fraught with uncertainty, but with the right financial tools, Ukraine can emerge from this war stronger, more resilient, and more connected to the global economy than ever before. War risk insurance is the key to unlocking that future.

Opinion: Is Russia’s new nuclear doctrine a game of bluff or a shift in strategy?	Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a seemingly significant modification of Russia&#x2019;s military doctrine in a statement on Sept. 25. He revealed that the new doctrine would propose considering aggression against Russia by a non-nuclear state, &#x201C;with the participation or support of a nuclear state,&#x201D; as a &#x201C;joint attack&#x201D; on Russia. Putin&#x2019;s message to the West is clear: If you help Ukraine militarily, we may also target you. The Russian president further explained that the new doctrine will &#x201C;clearly set the conditions for Russia to transition to using nuclear weapons.&#x201D; &#x201C;We will consider such a possibility (of nuclear retaliation) when we receive reliable information about a massive launch of air and space attack assets and them crossing our state border,&#x201D; Putin warned darkly, citing &#x201C;strategic and tactical aircraft, cruise missiles, drones, (and) &#xA0;hypersonic and other flying vehicles.&#x201D; He clarified that the changes apply to both Russia and Belarus. What makes this threat different from Putin&#x2019;s earlier ones is not its boldness but that it concerns a forthcoming formal document. Despite this, Putin&#x2019;s announcements do not fundamentally alter Russia&#x2019;s position. The pre-announced changes to Russia&#x2019;s military doctrine are as much a psychological operation by the Kremlin as previous nuclear intimidations. As with past threats, Moscow aims to scare away foreign supporters of Ukraine from continuing and expanding their aid. The proposed change in military doctrine is another attempt to curtail Western assistance to Ukraine. However, it&#x2019;s important to put Putin&#x2019;s statement in context. Russian official texts &#x2013; whether laws, doctrines, or treaties &#x2013; carry little weight in a country where there is no rule of law and state behavior is marked by arbitrariness. As in domestic affairs, Kremlin decisions are based on political preferences, with legal acts being adapted, interpreted or amended as needed. Putin&#x2019;s latest threats are linked to ongoing strategic debates in the West. One critical discussion is whether to provide Ukraine with more advanced &#xA0;weaponry, including Germany&#x2019;s highly effective, yet now notorious, Taurus cruise missiles. Another debate concerns allowing Ukraine to use Western missiles inside Russia. The latter, in particular, seems to be a source of concern for the Kremlin. These issues must be viewed in their broader historical context. For more than two years, Ukraine has attacked Russian military targets in Crimea, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts &#x2013; territories Russia considers its own following the illegal annexations of 2014 and 2022, as well as respective changes in the Russian Constitution. More recently, Ukraine has also targeted military and industrial sites within Russia&#x2019;s undisputed territory, including a drone attack on the Kremlin. Some of these strikes, particularly those on large ammunition depots deep inside Russia, have been notably successful.

(Contributor/Getty Images)Russia&#x2019;s current military doctrine already allows the use of nuclear weapons in response to conventional attacks. Since 2010, the doctrine has permitted nuclear retaliation if the state&apos;s existence is threatened by conventional weapons. This provision was reaffirmed in the 2020 &quot;Foundations of State Policy of the Russian Federation in the Area of Nuclear Deterrence.&quot; Given Ukraine&#x2019;s repeated attacks on Russian territory, Moscow could have invoked this doctrine long ago as justification for a nuclear response. Since 2014, Putin and his associates have repeatedly signaled their willingness to use nuclear weapons in response to Western-supported Ukrainian resistance against Russia&#x2019;s territorial expansion using conventional weaponry. The phrase &quot;the very existence of the Russian state&quot; could be interpreted to encompass the inviolability of its borders and the security of its airspace &#x2013; including the annexed Ukrainian territories that Moscow now views as part of Russia. Ukraine&#x2019;s strikes and incursions into legitimate and illegally held Russian territory since 2022 could also have been viewed by the Kremlin as justification for retaliating with weapons of mass destruction. However, no nuclear weapons have been used. This is because Russian threats &#x2013; whether verbal or written &#x2013; are not previews of actual actions. They are part of a psychological warfare campaign aimed at undermining Ukraine&#x2019;s defense. Putin&#x2019;s recent announcement of changes to Russia&#x2019;s military doctrine is just another move in this high-stakes PR game. A decision to use nuclear weapons would be driven more by political calculations than by doctrinal documents. If the Kremlin believes that using such weapons would enhance its power, it may act &#x2013; regardless of the specific wording in official texts. Political utility, rather than legal obligation, will guide Moscow&#x2019;s choices. This means, first, that an escalation against NATO remains unlikely as long as Moscow believes in the seriousness of the alliance&#x2019;s mutual defense commitments. Second, Western and other governments must make it clear to the Kremlin that using nuclear weapons in Ukraine will have severe consequences. To prevent nuclear escalation, world leaders should send an unequivocal message to Moscow: Further escalation of Russia&#x2019;s genocidal war on Ukraine will not go unpunished. Putin&#x2019;s threats must be met with a resounding global rejection.

Kyiv, Budapest see 'positive dynamics' on national minorities issue, Ukrainian foreign minister says	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Sept. 30 after talks with his Hungarian counterpart Peter Szijjarto in Budapest that both sides see &quot;positive dynamics&quot; in resolving issues related to national minorities, as reported by European Pravda. Budapest has repeatedly accused Kyiv of discriminating against the Hungarian ethnic minority concentrated in southwestern Ukraine, an accusation that the Ukrainian leadership denies. Hungary has been long considered the most Kremlin-friendly country within the EU, repeatedly obstructing sanctions against Russia and military aid to Kyiv. Sybiha and Szijjarto held talks in a one-on-one format and discussed &quot;in detail a wide bilateral and international agenda,&quot; according to the Ukrainian official. Following the meeting, the Ukrainian minister mentioned opening a bilingual Ukrainian-Hungarian school for Ukrainian children in Hungary. &quot;I am confident that this educational institution will contribute to the preservation of Ukrainian identity, help children adapt to the environment without losing their cultural roots, and will be another step towards understanding between Ukraine and Hungary,&quot; Sybiha said after his visit to the school. Sybiha added that Ukraine reaffirms its bilateral and international commitments to ensure the rights of persons belonging to the Hungarian national community. &quot;Mr. Minister (Szijjarto) and I have noted the positive dynamics in resolving this issue (on national minorities) and agreed to cooperate further to reach an understanding on all sensitive issues,&quot; he said. The Hungarians of Ukraine are &quot;an integral and equal part of the Ukrainian political nation and a key bridge of understanding between the two countries,&quot; Sybiha said. Many of Kyiv and Budapest&apos;s disputes over the national minority question center around Ukraine&apos;s language laws that require at least 70% of education above fifth grade to be conducted in Ukrainian. While Budapest has called this measure discriminatory toward the Hungarian minority, Kyiv retorted that it only aims to ensure that every Ukrainian citizen has sufficient knowledge of the official language. Hungary has formulated an 11-point request to Ukraine regarding the rights of national minorities, which included the restoration of the status of a national school, the ability to gain a high school diploma in Hungarian, and the ability to use Hungarian in public life. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported in mid-March that Hungary has sent a document to the EU member states criticizing Ukraine&apos;s policies on national minorities. In the document, Budapest reportedly demanded the restoration of the rights its minority had before 2015, noting that the protection of national minorities&apos; rights is one of the priorities mentioned in the negotiating framework for Ukraine&apos;s potential accession to the EU. Hungary also called for the possibility of political representation at the regional and national levels, according to the document. Kyiv has not publicly responded to the document. In September 2023, the Ukrainian parliament approved changes to national minorities law, which was one of seven steps recommended by the European Commission in June 2022 for Ukraine&apos;s accession to the European Union. The changes were signed into law by President Volodymyr Zelensky in November. Russia, a longtime ally of Hungary and its Prime Minister Viktor Orban, claimed, among other pretexts, that it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine to &quot;protect Russian speakers in Ukraine.&quot; There is has been no evidence to support the claim that Russian-speakers in Ukraine faced discrimination. According to the 2023 survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS), 84% of Ukrainians believe there are no problems with using the Russian language in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-budapest-see-positive-dynamics-on-national-minorities-issue-sybiha-says/	2024-09-30T08:05:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GYuIfgEWcAEyrGJ.jpeg
Putin says 'all intended goals will be achieved' in Ukraine on 2nd anniversary of major failed achievement	Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sept. 30 vowed that &quot;all the intended goals will be achieved&quot; in Ukraine, in a speech marking the second anniversary of something the Kremlin has yet to achieve. In a video message to the Russian public, Putin said he was addressing his people to &quot;celebrate the Day of Reunification with Russia of the Donetsk and Luhansk People&apos;s Republics, Zaporizhia and Kherson Regions.&quot; Putin declared the illegal annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts in September 2022, despite only partially occupying the southern and eastern areas of Ukraine in question. A Ukrainian counteroffensive just weeks later liberated great swathes of the Kherson Oblast territory, including the provincial capital, claimed by Russia. The regional capitals of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia remain under Ukrainian control, while Luhansk and Donetsk have been occupied by Russia since 2014. &quot;I cordially congratulate all citizens of our country on this truly fateful event,&quot; Putin said. The Russian president also took aim at Ukraine&apos;s Western allies, who he claimed have &quot;turned Ukraine into their colony, into a military base aimed at Russia.&quot; &quot;They systematically instilled hatred and radical nationalism, incited hostility towards everything Russian, supplied weapons, sent mercenaries and advisers, prepared the Ukrainian army for a new war, so that again, as in the spring and summer of 2014, they could carry out a punitive action in the southeast,&quot; he added. &quot;I thank all citizens of the country for this unity and patriotic spirit. The truth is on our side. All the intended goals will be achieved.&quot; Putin&apos;s original goals in his full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched in early 2022 were to &#x201C;liberate the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, &quot;demilitarize and denazify&quot; the country which in the Kremlin&apos;s eyes, envisioned the removal of its Jewish president, and the occupation of its capital city Kyiv. After swiftly failing to achieve these goals, with the exception of Russian forces occupying all of Luhansk Oblast, Putin was forced to lower his ambitions and earlier this month said Russia&apos;s &quot;main goal&quot; was to capture all of Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donbas area that also includes the adjacent Donetsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-says-all-intended-goals-will-be-achieved-in-ukraine-on-2nd-anniversary-of-major-failed-achievement/	2024-09-30T06:16:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173708243.jpg
Russia intensifies attacks on recaptured Vovchansk plant, uses 'maximum range of weapons,' military says	Russian troops are using &quot;the maximum range of weapons&quot; to attack the recently recaptured aggregate plant in the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Kharkiv Group of Forces spokesperson Vitalii Sarantsev said on Sept. 30. Describing the situation as &quot;difficult,&quot; Sarantsev said Russian forces were continuously assaulting in the Kharkiv sector, and had made the Vovchansk plant its &quot;number one goal.&quot; Russian troops had been in control of the facility for several months before it was recaptured by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) special forces. on Sept. 24., HUR previously reported. &quot;(The plant) is not a tactical target as such for (Russia). But at the same time, the loss of this facility was a very powerful blow to its image,&quot; the spokesperson said. Speaking on national television, Sarantsev said that Russian forces are carrying out attacks against the plant with guided aerial bombs and &quot;Solntsepek&quot; multiple rocket launchers. &quot;In other words, (Russia) is following its standard practice of destroying what it could not capture,&quot; he added. Ukrainian forces captured around 20 Russian soldiers and killed &quot;several dozen&quot; others during an operation to recapture an aggregate plant in the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, a member of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) claimed last week. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. Vovchansk is an embattled town some 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Kharkiv that has seen heavy battles since Russia launched a new offensive in the area in May. While initially gaining ground, the Russian offensive in northern Kharkiv Oblast has quickly bogged down, with Russian troops reportedly suffering heavy losses. The intensity of fighting has decreased somewhat compared to other sectors in Ukraine&apos;s east near Pokrovsk, Vuhledar and Toretsk.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-intensifies-attacks-on-recaptured-vovchansk-plant-as-number-one-goal/	2024-09-30T05:41:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/--------------2024-09-30-151342.png
Russia aims to draft 133,000 during new round of fall conscription	Russia is planning to draft 133,000 Russians between October and January, according to a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin on Sept. 30. Men aged from 18 to 30 will be drafted as part of the regularly occurring fall conscription campaign. The decree applies to Russians who are not in the reserve and are subject to military service. Those soldiers whose service has already expired are to be dismissed. The fall 2023 conscription included the illegally annexed areas of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. The U.K. Defense Ministry said in March that is likely recruiting around 30,000 people a month to help bolster its war effort. Ukraine adopted a law on mobilization in April as part of an effort to replenish the ranks of the Armed Forces. The need to increase the number of troops persists as Russia continues to advance in Donetsk Oblast and Ukraine after opened a new front in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Recent legislation reforms pertaining to mobilization also included a law lowering the minimum age of compulsory military service from 27 to 25. After the law came into force in Ukraine on May 18, military-aged men were given 60 days to update their personal data so that the state could locate them. Between May 18 and the mid-July deadline, over 4,6 million military-aged men had done so, the country&apos;s Defense Ministry said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-aims-to-draft-133-000-during-new-round-of-fall-conscription/	2024-09-30T04:29:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/gettyimages-1243878229-1-1665572527iw7je.webp
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 3, injure 45 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed three people and injured at least 45 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Sept. 30. Ukrainian forces downed 67 out of 73 Shahed-type drones as well as one Iskander-M ballistic missile, Kh-59/69 cruise missile and a Kh-31P missile launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Another drone entered Belarusian airspace and three more drones were &quot;lost,&quot; it added. A Russian air strike on the city of Zaporizhzhia injured at least 16 people, including two boys aged 17, and eight, according to Governor Ivan Fedorov. The attack damaged residential buildings and a railway. Two people were killed in the villages of Lysivka and Shevchenko in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Three more people were injured in the region over the past day. Ten peopled were injured in several communities in Sumy Oblast as a result of guided aerial bomb and FPV drone attacks, local authorities reported. Russian attacks on the villages of Bohuslavka and Odnorobivka in Kharkiv Oblast injured three men and a woman, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 17 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. One person was killed and 12 were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-3-injure-45-over-past-day/	2024-09-30T03:26:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2024-09-30_09-37-37.jpg
Ukraine's new FM arrives in Hungary, holds talks with Szijjarto	Ukraine&apos;s new Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha arrived in Budapest on Sept. 30 to meet his Hungarian counterpart Peter Szijjarto, his ministry has announced. The ministers began talks in a one-on-one format, according to a statement posted on social media. The two are expected to discuss the development of relations, the implementation of joint projects, including protection of the rights of national minorities, and Ukraine&apos;s accession to the EU and NATO among other topics. Budapest has repeatedly opposed Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO and the EU, sanctions on Russia, undermined Western aid efforts for Ukraine, and maintained close relations with Moscow throughout the full-scale war. In June, Kyiv imposed sanctions blocking Lukoil, one of the largest oil companies in Russia, from transiting crude oil through the Druzhba pipeline running through Ukrainian territory, affecting supplies to Hungary. The move aims to cut off one of the Kremlin&apos;s sources of income used to finance its war against Ukraine. This is Sybiha&apos;s first trip to Hungary as foreign minister as part of his tour. In recent weeks, he visited Romania and Slovakia. Sybiha&apos;s predecessor, Dmytro Kuleba, and head of the Presidential Office Andrii Yermak held several meeting with Szijjarto before Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban visited Kyiv for the first time since the start of the full-scale war. During his talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky in early July, Orban urged him to consider a ceasefire as a step toward peace, which Ukraine&apos;s president dismissed, saying it would only provide a window of opportunity for Russia to regroup its forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-fm-arrives-in-budapest-holds-talks-with-szijjarto/	2024-09-30T01:42:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/459035259_944440644393068_5124456779231225497_n.jpg
Some details of Ukraine's victory plan will remain secret, Yermak says	President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s victory plan will be made public but some parts will remain secret, the head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak said on Sept. 29. Zelensky presented the five-point victory plan to his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden at the White House on Sept. 26. He also discussed it with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris and members of Congress. The plan includes military and diplomatic components, including Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO, but the full details of the peace framework have not yet been publicized. The goal of the plan is to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s future negotiating position and push Russia to make a just peace, Kyiv has said. Speaking on national TV, Yermak said the plan will be presented to Ukrainians without some &quot;sensitive&quot; details to prevent information from leaking to Russia. &quot;Everything that becomes public is heard not only in our country, but also by the enemy. That is why some details of this plan are classified. But it is important to see the implementation of this plan on enemy territory,&quot; he added. While Zelensky was in the U.S. last week, reports emerged that the White House was concerned the plan lacks a clear strategy to win against Russia Following the visit to the U.S., presidential spokesperson Serhii Nykyforov said that Washington took the plan &quot;constructively.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians/	2024-09-30T01:31:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/ffacfaa7983e7e7df4c60c3a62791069_1714407581_extra_large.jpeg
Commander of Ukraine's 72nd Brigade transferred amid battle for Vuhledar	Colonel Ivan Vinnik, commander of Ukraine&apos;s 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade currently defending the embattled town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, has been transferred, the brigade confirmed on Sept. 29. According to Operational Command &quot;North,&quot; Vinnik was transferred &quot;for the purpose of promotion and to transfer combat experience.&quot; It was not announced who would replace him. Vinnik was appointed commander of the 72nd Brigade in August 2022. Under his command, the brigade has defended Vuhledar for more than two years. Russian forces have been trying to capture the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. &quot;Since the summer of 2022 till today, I have had a long and difficult journey. But it was not difficult, because I did not overcome it alone. I had a loyal and motivated team by my side,&quot; Vinnik said in a post on Facebook. &quot;I thank each and every one of you for your patience, willpower and strength. Thank you for listening, hearing, talking and offering suggestions. Thank you for our joint struggle. &quot;Thank you for being by my side. I really appreciate it! I am honoured to be a part of the Black Cossacks, and the bond that has been formed between us will remain forever.&quot; The reshuffle comes at a time when fierce fighting for Vuhledar is still ongoing. The front-line town lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Russian troops had not reached the outskirts of Vuhledar as of Sept. 25, Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin. A day later, the brigade refuted reports that it was retreating from the town and released a video from the town. The crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState claimed on Sept. 29 that Russian troops trying to gain a foothold in high-rise buildings on the outskirts of Vuhledar. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. &quot;The loss of Vuhledar would be not only a morale blow for Ukraine since this city has resisted plenty of assaults since 2022, but also a very serious development that can potentially threaten the security of the entire southwestern portion of Donetsk Oblast not yet occupied, along with the threat to Pokrovsk&apos;s southern flank,&quot; Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent earlier this month.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-72nd-brigade-commander-dismissed-amid-battles-for-vuhledar/	2024-09-29T23:34:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/298546450_376472717990310_6001794130969474415_n.jpg
Hours of explosions heard in Kyiv as capital fends of waves of Russian attack drones	Kyiv was targeted by several waves of Russian attack drones overnight, city authorities said on Sept. 30. Air raid sirens sounded in the capital just after 1 a.m., with the all clear not being given until just after 6 a.m. As air defenses engaged the drones, Kyiv Independent correspondents heard multiple explosions, anti-aircraft fire, and the sound of the UAVs flying overhead in at least one district of the city. Shortly before 5 a.m., Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said several drones were &quot;over and near the capital,&quot; adding: &quot;Stay in shelters!&quot; No damage or casualties have been reported at this time, though Klitschko said the wreckage of one drone had been found near a residential building in Kyiv&apos;s Obolon district. &quot;All Russian attack drones that threatened Kyiv were neutralized,&quot; Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said in a post on Telegram, adding several waves had attacked the city from different directions. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force later said Russian forces had launched 73 Shahed-type drones against cities across Ukraine overnight, 67 of which were intercepted. It did not specify how many had attacked Kyiv. Russian drone attacks on Kyiv have stepped up in recent weeks &#x2013; overnight on Sept. 26, more than 15 drones were spotted near the capital, with around 10 of them downed by air defenses, the Kyiv City Military Administration said.	https://kyivindependent.com/hours-of-explosions-heard-in-kyiv-as-capital-fends-of-waves-of-russian-attack-drones/	2024-09-29T22:49:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/photo_2024-01-09_17-13-51.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 653,060 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 653,060 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Sept. 30. This number includes 1,250 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 8,874 tanks, 17,503 armored fighting vehicles, 25,548 vehicles and fuel tanks, 18,822 artillery systems, 1,204 multiple launch rocket systems, 963 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 328 helicopters, 16,224 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-653-060-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-09-29T22:06:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166827688-1.jpg
Helsinki Commission paper calls for reconsideration of US strategy toward Russia, The Hill reports	The bipartisan committee tasked with promoting democracy and human rights in post-Soviet states is urging the U.S. to abandon its post-Cold War approach to Russia and officially recognize Moscow as a &quot;persistent&quot; threat to global security. In a report obtained by The Hill ahead of its release, the Helsinki Commission calls for a major shift in Washington&apos;s strategy toward Russia, similar to its recent rethinking of relations with China, and recommends allocating resources accordingly. A key element of the proposed strategy is ensuring Ukraine&#x2019;s victory in its war against Russia. The report advocates for &quot;massive&quot; military and humanitarian aid to Kyiv and supports allowing Ukraine&apos;s forces to strike targets deep inside Russia using U.S.-supplied weapons. These recommendations go beyond the Biden administration&#x2019;s current commitments to Ukraine and conflict with the views of former President Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, and his congressional allies. Trump has argued that the U.S. is overspending on European security and has campaigned on negotiating a deal between Ukraine and Russia through direct talks with their leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Helsinki Commission&apos;s report recommends that Russia&apos;s nuclear threats &quot;cannot simply be dismissed,&quot; but should instead be countered with &quot;sound reasoning.&quot; &quot;We can&#x2019;t let fear dominate how we think about this kind of stuff,&quot; a congressional aide said, explaining the report&#x2019;s call for a clear plan to address and respond to potential nuclear threats and attacks. The report also advocates for a shift in how Washington views Russia, urging policymakers to stop treating the country as a superpower or near-peer to the U.S. solely because of its nuclear arsenal. The report emphasizes the need for the U.S. to be fully engaged with its global allies, particularly those on the front lines of Russian aggression, manipulation, and coercion. This stance pushes back against the rising trend of isolationism, especially within the GOP.	https://kyivindependent.com/helsinki-commission-paper-calls-for-reconsideration-of-us-strategy-toward-russia-the-hill-reports/	2024-09-29T20:49:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1546180412.jpg
Norway considering building fence along Russian border to curb migrant crossings	Norway is considering building fencing along the country&apos;s border with Russia amid ongoing concerns over migrant crossings, Norway&apos;s Justice Minister Emily Anger Mel said in an interview with Norway&apos;s NRK media outlet. Mel said that the country is looking at &quot;several measures&quot; to increase security along the nearly 200 km northern border with Russia, including building fences. &quot;A border fence is very interesting, not only because it can act as a deterrent but also because it contains sensors and technology that allow you to detect if people are moving close to the border&quot; Mel told NRK in an interview published late on Sept. 28 No details have yet to be provided about a potential plan and it is unclear as to whether the whole 200 km border would be fenced off. The consideration follows neighboring Finland&apos;s construction of a border fence after Finland accused Russia of weaponizing migration by encouraging migrants from countries like Syria and Somalia to cross the border. Finland closed its land borders with Russia late last year after more than 1,300 asylum seekers crossed over from Russia. Pointing to concerns over a lack of security at the Norway-Russia border, Mel cited a 2015 example of approximately 5,000 asylum seekers who arrived at the Sturskug border in northeastern Norway - the only legal land border crossing between the two countries. No data was immediately available as to how many Russian migrants crossed the border since the start of the full-scale invasion. In November 2023, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said that the country may follow the example of Finland and close its land border crossing with Russia &quot;if necessary&quot; &#xA0;- although it has yet to do so. Reports of Moscow-orchestrated migrant crisis echo the strategy used by Belarus against its NATO neighbors. Minsk has been facilitating flows of third-country migrants to the Baltic countries and Poland since 2021.	https://kyivindependent.com/norway-considering-building-fence-along-russian-border-to-curb-migrant-crossings/	2024-09-29T17:06:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1258278947.jpeg
Russian attacks on Sumy Oblast injure 10	Russian forces attacked 14 communities on Sept. 29, injuring 10 people throughout the day, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration reported. In the town of Esman, five people were injured after a Russian KAB guided aerial bomb struck the community. Another KAB guided bomb attack on the village of Hlukiv injured a further two people. According to the Sumy Oblast Prosecutor&apos;s Office, the attack on Esman injured a total of five women between the ages of 38 and 77, while in Hlukhiv a 53-year-old woman and her 50-year-old husband were injured. Elsewhere in Sumy Oblast, drone attacks targeted various communities resulting in civillian casualties. In Yampil, one person was injured as a result of a Russian drone attack, while in the village of Druzhba two others were injured. According to investigators, the drone attack in the village of Druzhba targeted a passenger train at the railway station. The train conductor and an employee of the railway station were injured in the attacks. No details were provided on the attack on the community of Yampil. Residents in Sumy Oblast are subjected to daily attacks on the region, with Russia intensifying the use of KAB guided aerial bombs in the area. On Sept. 28, Russian forces launched a double-tap strike on a hospital in the northeastern city of Sumy, killing 10 people and injuring 22. Moscow initially attacked with an airstrike and Shahed-type drones, followed by a powerful KAB guided bomb strike, the Air Force confirmed. The security situation in Sumy Oblast became more tense with the start of Ukraine&apos;s cross-border incursion into neighboring Kursk Oblast in Russia, which began on Aug. 6. Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrskyi said in an interview with CNN, published on Sept. 5, that Russia was planning an offensive from Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast onto Sumy Oblast before Ukrainian forces launched operations there. In late August, amid ongoing attacks on the region, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko told reporters that authorities are planning to evacuate a total of 45,000 residents from Sumy Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-on-sumy-oblast-injure-10/	2024-09-29T15:19:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/IMG_2804.jpeg
Ukraine war latest: Zelensky says Putin 'afraid' to use nuclear weapons because he 'loves his life'	Key developments on Sept. 29: President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed skepticism in an interview with Fox News over Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s continued nuclear threats throughout the full-scale war, saying that Putin &quot;loves his life&quot; and is, therefore, likely afraid to use nuclear weapons. &quot;Nobody knows what&apos;s in his head,&quot; Zelensky said in the interview, which was posted to the president&apos;s official Youtube channel on Sept. 29. &quot;He could use nuclear (weapons) on any country at any time &#x2013; or not. (But) I don&apos;t think that he will.&quot; Since the launch of the full-scale invasion, Russia has repeatedly invoked the threat of its nuclear arsenal to deter Western military support for Ukraine. The Russian military will be able to &quot;determine the conditions&quot; for the use of nuclear weapons, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Russian state-controlled television on Sept. 29. &quot;(The military) closely monitors what weapons are used and how. They are the ones who record the direct involvement of the countries of the collective West in the (war in) Ukraine, and they will not diminish their focus,&quot; Peskov said. Peskov went on to blame NATO member states for aiding Ukraine in its war effort against Russia, claiming that it &quot;made it necessary to make adjustments both to the nuclear doctrine and to the foundations of state policy in the area of &#x200B;&#x200B;nuclear deterrence.&quot; In a speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Sept. 28, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Ukraine and its Western allies should not try &quot;to fight to victory with a nuclear power.&quot; Lavrov&apos;s remarks come days after Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed revisions to Moscow&apos;s nuclear doctrine at a U.N. Security Council meeting. Putin announced that Russia could respond to conventional missile strikes with nuclear weapons, and indicated that Moscow would treat any attack backed by a nuclear-armed country as a coordinated assault. Russia attacked the city of Zaporizhzhia with guided bombs overnight on Sept. 29, injuring at least 16 civilians, local authorities reported. As of 1:58 p.m. local time, the number of injured stands at 16, according to regional police. Among the wounded include a 17-year-old boy. Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Ivan Fedorov said via his official Telegram channel that the city was targeted at least 10 times. Several buildings caught fire following the attack which also destroyed a high-rise and several residential homes. More people may be trapped under the rubble, Fedorov added. The city of Zaporizhzhia is located less than 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the front lines. Russia has continued to strike civilian targets across Zaporizhzhia Oblast, which is partially occupied by Russian forces. On Sept. 23, Russia&apos;s strike against the city killed one man and injured seven other civilians, including a 13-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy, according to local authorities. Russian troops also appear to be preparing for assault operations in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where &quot;the enemy is amassing personnel,&quot; the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command spokesman Vladyslav Voloshyn said on Sept. 28. Ukrainian forces struck the Kotluban military arsenal in Russia&apos;s Volgograd Oblast, the General Staff reported on Sept. 29. The military arsenal was used to store and modernize missiles and artillery, according to the General Staff. Iranian-made Shahed missiles had also been transported to the facility shortly before the attack took place. &quot;The military facility was heavily protected by electronic warfare and air defense systems. Nevertheless, our units successfully completed the combat mission,&quot; the General Staff wrote. The Kyiv Independent couldn&apos;t independently verify the claim. Earlier on Sept. 29, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed that 67 Ukrainian-launched drones were shot down over Volgograd Oblast and that 125 drones in total had been intercepted over seven Russian regions. Kyiv has carried out a number of drone attacks against Russian infrastructure facilities and military installations throughout the full-scale war, hoping to undermine Russian invasion forces in Ukraine. Russian officials often play down attacks and claim no significant damage was inflicted. Ukrainian drones attacked one of the largest arsenals in Russia, causing a powerful detonation in the town of Toropets in Russia&apos;s Tver Oblast, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent on Sept. 18. On Sept. 21, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff confirmed a strike on the Tikhoretsk weapons depot in Krasnodar Krai, which it called one of three largest ammunition depots in Russia and &quot;one of the key storage facilities in the Russian military&apos;s logistics system.&quot; One hundred twenty-five Ukrainian drones launched overnight were intercepted over seven Russian regions, Russian state-controlled media TASS claimed on Sept. 29. The drones targeted Volgograd, Belgorod, Voronezh, Rostov, Bryansk, and Kursk oblasts, as well as Krasnodar Krai, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. The Ministry also claims three drones were shot down over the Sea of Azov. The aforementioned regions are located at various distances along Ukraine&apos;s eastern border. The ministry claims 67 drones were shot down over Volgograd Oblast, 17 over Belgorod Oblast, 17 over Voronezh Oblast, 18 over Rostov Oblast, and one each over Bryansk and Kursk oblasts. There has been no comment on the attacks from Kyiv. Kyiv has carried out a number of drone attacks against Russian infrastructure facilities and military installations throughout the full-scale war, hoping to undermine Russian invasion forces in Ukraine. No casualties resulted from the drones targeting Voronezh Oblast, Governor Alexander Gusev claimed. The drone attack inflicted property damage in the city and the surrounding region, including one residential building that was &quot;significantly damaged,&quot; but somehow &quot;none of the residents need temporary housing,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-zelensky-says-putin-afraid-to-use-nuclear-weapons-because-he-loves-his-life/	2024-09-29T12:44:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173768511.jpeg
Far-right party opposed to Ukraine aid wins Austria elections	Austria&#x2019;s far-right Freedom Party came first in a general election on Sept. 29, according to voter projections. The party is known for its Kremlin-friendly stance and opposition to aid for Ukraine in its fight against Russia. The Freedom Party of Austria, or FPO, which is led by Herbert Kickl, is expected to secure 29.1% of the vote over the ruling conservative Austrian People&apos;s Party and the center-left Social Democrats. Following the elections, the party will have to create a coalition government, but other party leaders have already signaled they are opposed to forming a government with the FPO. Kickl has recently forged an alliance with Orban and opposes providing aid to Kyiv. He has also said he wants sanctions against Russia over its war in Ukraine lifted, claiming they hurt his country more than Moscow. The country&#x2019;s president, Alexander Van der Bellen, has criticized the FPO for its stance on Ukraine and failure to condemn Russia&#x2019;s aggression against the country, as well as its Euroskepticsm. The FPO, which was originally formed by a Nazi lawmaker in the 1950s, is critical of immigration and asylum seekers, saying it will curb migration to Austria. The election follows other far-right election successes in the Netherlands, France, and Germany.	https://kyivindependent.com/far-right-party-opposed-to-ukraine-aid-wins-austria-elections/	2024-09-29T12:13:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174719950.jpg
Denmark to invest nearly $630 million into Ukraine's defense production	Denmark will invest 4.2 billion Danish kroner ($628 million) into Ukraine&apos;s arms production, according to Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen. Poulsen signed the following agreements with his Ukrainian counterpart Rustem Umerov and Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin in Kyiv. The Danish defense minister&apos;s trip to Kyiv took place as part of the run-up to the defense industries forum set to start on Oct. 1. Of the sum announced by Poulsen, 1.3 billion kroner ($200 million) will be provided by the Danish government, while the rest will be provided by Denmark as part of the country&apos;s commitments to hand over profits obtained from frozen Russian assets. &quot;It is important that we continue to support Ukraine&apos;s freedom struggle in all the ways we can,&quot; Poulsen said. The Danish government has previously allocated 130 million Danish kroner ($19.5 million) to restore Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure after Russia&apos;s mass attacks, according to the Sept. 23 Denmark Energy Ministry&apos;s statement. The Danish government also announced a $115 million military aid package for Ukraine on Aug. 19. The Danish government promised to transfer another batch of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine later this year, Poulsen said earlier this month. Copenhagen has pledged to deliver 19 aircraft to Ukraine in total but did not disclose how many had already been provided. Poulsen did not name the size of the second batch either &quot;for the sake of operational security.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/denmark-to-invest-nearly-630-million-into-ukraines-defense-production/	2024-09-29T11:59:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2171996068.jpg
The Insider: Obtained documents drawn following Navalny's death omit acute stomach pain, hint at possible poisoning	According to The Insider, the Russian independent investigative outlet received access to &quot;hundreds&quot; of official documents that were drawn following the death of Alexei Navalny in a penal colony in Russia&apos;s Arctic. The discrepancy between internal documents and the ones made public by the state suggests that officials have lied about the causes of death and forged documents meant for the public eye. The initial documents detail moments before Navalny&apos;s death. According to papers signed by investigator Alexander Voropaev, Navalny felt sick, fell to the floor, and called for help, saying that he felt severe stomach pain and began to vomit. In the final version of the same document, stomach pain and vomiting were omitted. According to intensivist Alexander Polupan, who provided care for Navalny following his poisoning with Novichok nerve agent in 2020, all the symptoms in the initial documents hint at yet another poisoning. &quot;Such symptoms can hardly be explained by something other than poisoning,&quot; Polupan told The Insider. Navalny was Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s main opponent, and the Kremlin had used all the tools at its disposal to shut him up. He was sentenced in several criminal cases, and some of his allies have also been imprisoned. Back in 2020, Navalny was poisoned in Russia and flown for treatment to Germany while in a coma. German doctors, as well as several independent labs in Europe, said that he had been poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent &#x2013; a chemical weapon produced by the Russian government. A joint investigation by The Insider, Bellingcat, CNN, and Der Spiegel revealed that Navalny had been poisoned by agents of Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service. The media also identified the agents&apos; names.	https://kyivindependent.com/the-insider-official-documents-following-navalnys-death-were-forged-hinting-at-possible-poisoning/	2024-09-29T10:18:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1915800931.jpg

Russian parliament speaker announces bills tightening migration policy	The Russian State Duma introduced five bills that would tighten migration policy in the country, Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin announced on Sept. 29. There has been an uptick in anti-migration sentiment in Russia in recent months, especially toward migrants from Central Asia, after several gunmen opened fire at a venue in the Moscow suburbs at the end of March. The bills propose harsher punishments for illegal immigrants who commit crimes given their migration status, increased penalties for &quot;organizing&quot; illegal migration, increased liability for forged documents, blocking internet services that offer illegal services to migrants, and banning intermediary organizations involved in administering exams - such as Russian language proficiency - for migrants. Volodin claimed that over 4,500 cases of document forgery were registered by the Russian Internal Affairs Ministry this year. The proposed bills would &quot;contribute to establishing order in the area of migration policy,&quot; he added. Following the terrorist attack on Moscow in late March, Russia began conducting raids on dormitories and apartments known to house Central Asian migrants and carrying out mass deportations. A branch of the Islamic State (ISIS) claimed responsibility for the attack shortly thereafter, and Russia detained four men from Tajikistan, the alleged perpetrators of the attack. In total, over a dozen people were arrested under suspicion of having a connection to the attack. Central Asian migrants make up a large number of Russia&apos;s workforce. At the end of March, Tajikistan&apos;s Labor, Employment, and Migration Ministry reported that more Tajik migrants in Russia were returning home than usual.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-state-duma-announces-bills-that-would-tighten-migration-policy/	2024-09-29T06:28:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1855401938.jpg
Ukraine commemorates 83rd anniversary of Babyn Yar tragedy	Ukraine commemorated the 83rd anniversary of the Babyn Yar tragedy on Sept. 29, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying that it is a &quot;terrifying symbol&quot; of what can happen when the world &quot;lacks the determination to stand up against evil.&quot; The Babyn Yar tragedy was a mass murder of nearly 34,000 Jews by Nazi forces over two days in September 1941, near Kyiv, as part of the Holocaust. Estimates put the total death toll, which also includes Soviet prisoners of war and the Romani people, at over 100,000. &quot;Babyn Yar is a vivid proof of the savagery that regimes led by leaders who rely on intimidation and violence are capable of,&quot; Zelensky said, evidently drawing parallels between the atrocities committed by the Nazis during World War II and Russia&apos;s current full-scale war against Ukraine. &quot;They have remained unchanged throughout history. But the world&apos;s reaction must be different. This is what the world should have learned. We must stand guard over humanity, life, and justice.&quot; Last year, Zelensky commemorated the anniversary at the site of the massacre in Kyiv with members of the Jewish community. Zelensky emphasized how the Nazis indiscriminately targeted men, women, and children, forcing them to walk down what was later called &quot;the Road of Death&quot; to the Babyn Yar ravine. &quot;The scale of this evil is still hard to perceive,&quot; he added. &quot;When the eyes of the world are closed, humanity loses. We must defend ourselves against evil.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-commemorates-83rd-anniversary-babyn-yar-tragedy/	2024-09-29T04:53:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/382327268_18037735963561006_6852805925983607540_n.jpeg

Moldovan broadcaster's headquarters targeted in pre-election vandalism spree	Moldova&apos;s state-owned broadcaster reported on Sept. 28 that vandals had splashed paint across the entrance of its building in the capital, Chisinau. This incident occurred a day after police attributed similar acts to a group trained in Moscow with the aim of destabilizing the upcoming elections. &quot;We are not afraid of this act of vandalism, as long as we are devoted to society and citizens,&quot; Andrei Zapsa, deputy director general of Teleradio-Moldova, was quoted as saying, according to Reuters. Zapsa noted that the station had always anticipated potential attacks from &quot;radical groups.&quot; Police also reported that vandals poured paint on the Supreme Court building overnight. Moldovan authorities have connected these incidents to a group trained in Moscow to provoke instability ahead of next month&#x2019;s presidential election, where pro-European incumbent President Maia Sandu is favored to win against 10 challengers. Sandu&apos;s main opponents include Alexander Stoianoglo, who lost his position as prosecutor general and is supported by pro-Russian opposition parties, and Renato Usatii, who advocates for good relations with both the West and Moscow. On Sept. 27, Moldovan law enforcement agencies detained two young men in connection with similar incidents that occurred overnight, where they splashed yellow paint&#x2014;the color of Sandu&apos;s ruling pro-European party&#x2014;on two other government buildings. Police apprehended a 21-year-old man in a park and his 20-year-old accomplice near the parliament. According to police, the detainees said that they received 5,000 euros for one attack and underwent training in Russia. One of them admitted to recruiting young individuals who later traveled to Moscow and were paid 500 euros a month.	https://kyivindependent.com/moldovan-broadcasters-headquarters-targeted-in-pre-election-vandalism-spree/	2024-09-28T22:01:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1449645090.jpg

North Korea claims that US military aid to Ukraine is 'incredible mistake'	North Korea, facing accusations of illegally supplying weapons to Russia, slammed the U.S. decision to send $8 billion in military aid to Ukraine, labeling it an &quot;incredible mistake&quot; and warning that it risks sparking nuclear conflict with Russia. U.S. President Joe Biden announced the new aid package, which includes long-range weapons to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s ability to hit Russian targets from safer distances, during President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s visit to Washington. Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, accused the U.S. of intensifying the war in Ukraine and pushing Europe toward the edge of nuclear war, according to Reuters. In a statement released by state news agency KCNA, Kim said: &quot;The United States and the West should not dismiss or underestimate Russia&apos;s serious warning. Are they truly prepared to face the consequences of recklessly playing with fire against Russia, a nuclear superpower?&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly cautioned that Russia may use nuclear weapons if attacked, and he views any assault on Russia supported by a nuclear-armed nation as a collective strike. Kim also condemned the U.S. decision to provide further military aid to Zelensky, calling it a &quot;dangerous and irresponsible gamble&quot; and describing the move as &quot;an incredible mistake and foolish act.&quot; Kim regularly issues statements on North Korea&apos;s political and security positions, which are widely believed to reflect the views of the country&apos;s supreme leader.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-claims-that-us-military-aid-to-ukraine-is-incredible-mistake/	2024-09-28T19:43:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1247659588.jpg
Energoatom confirms detention of company official on bribery charges	Ukraine&apos;s state nuclear energy agency Energoatom on Sept. 28 confirmed that one of its officials had been detained for accepting a bribe. The official, who leads the control and audit department, was apprehended near Energoatom&apos;s office in Kyiv while accepting a bribe of UAH 100,000 ($2,400). The money was demanded in exchange for resolving fuel supply issues. According to a statement from Energoatom, &quot;The detainee used his connections to help resolve the issue with another company, acting as a middleman between the contractor and the other firm.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Security Service&apos;s (SBU) Main Directorate in Kyiv and Kyiv Oblast, with oversight from the Kyiv City Prosecutor&apos;s Office, conducted the operation. &quot;A top priority for Energoatom is ensuring compliance with current laws, and the company has a strict zero-tolerance policy for corruption,&quot; the statement reads. &quot;This policy applies not only to internal matters but also to employees&apos; conduct outside of their official duties.&quot; Energoatom plays a crucial role in Ukraine&apos;s energy sector and is actively involved in modernizing and expanding the country&apos;s nuclear power capabilities, despite challenges posed by the ongoing war.	https://kyivindependent.com/energoatom-confirms-detention-of-company-official-on-bribery-charges/	2024-09-28T18:57:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1243382762.jpg
China's FM cautions against 'escalation' of Ukraine-Russia war	China&apos;s Foreign Minister Wang Yi cautioned on Sept. 28 against the escalation of the war in Ukraine, amid accusations from Kyiv that Beijing is supporting Russia. Kyiv has expressed skepticism towards Beijing&apos;s calls for negotiations, yet Wang reiterated China&apos;s willingness to assist in brokering a resolution. &quot;The top priority is to commit to no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting, and no provocation by any party, and push for de-escalation of the situation as soon as possible,&quot; he said during the U.N. General Assembly, according to Agence France-Presse. &quot;China is committed to playing a constructive role, engaging in shuttle mediation and promoting talks for peace, not throwing oil on the fire or exploiting the situation for selfish gains.&quot; China&apos;s support for Russia&apos;s defense industry has played a significant role in shifting the battlefield momentum in Ukraine in Moscow&apos;s favor. This assistance encompassed a range of critical elements, including the supply of crucial components and materials to Russia&apos;s military-industrial complex, the provision of dual-use technologies that have both civilian and military applications, and the delivery of chips, design features, and capacities associated with explosive manufacturing. China has also been instrumental in supporting the development of unmanned aerial vehicles that Russia has deployed in Ukraine, enhancing its battlefield capabilities. Russia has secretly established a development and production program in China for attack drones to be used in the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported on Sept. 25 citing European intelligence sources and documents reviewed by the outlet.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinas-fm-cautions-against-escalation-of-ukraine-russia-war/	2024-09-28T15:21:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/W020240724564401152035.jpg
Lithuania delivers ammunition, other support to Ukraine in military aid package	A military aid package that includes ammunition, computers, and logistical supplies will arrive in Ukraine this week, the Lithuanian government announced on Sept. 28. Lithuania has emerged as one of Kyiv&apos;s staunchest supporters amid Russia&apos;s full-scale war. The Baltic nation has provided Ukraine with helicopters, drones, armored vehicles, and air defense equipment along with extensive humanitarian support. &quot;Lithuania continues to provide military support to Ukraine. Logistics, ammunition, laptops and other support for its military will arrive in Ukraine this week,&quot; the government said in a statement. According to Vilnius, Lithuania has already delivered 155 mm ammunition, M577 and M113 armored vehicles, anti-drone systems, anti-tank weapons, remote detonation systems, and other equipment since the beginning of this year. The delivery comes as Ukraine&apos;s front-line troops work to recover from the devastating effects of a spring ammunition shortage. The shortage was brought on in large part by delays in U.S. military assistance. Lithuania on Sept. 23 signed a memorandum with the U.S. Northrop Grumman Corporation, a leading global aerospace and defense technology companies, to produce and supply medium-caliber ammunition. Earlier in September, Lithuania announced plans to allocate 10 million euros ($11 million) to buy new Ukrainian-made Palianytsia missile-drones for Kyiv. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Lithuania has provided Ukraine with military support worth over 683 million euros (approximately $763 million).	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-delivers-ammunition-other-support-to-ukraine-in-military-aid-package/	2024-09-28T12:48:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/lithuania.jpeg
West should not 'fight to victory' against nuclear state, Russian FM says at UN	Ukraine and its Western allies should not try &quot;to fight to victory with a nuclear power,&quot; Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 28. Since the launch of the full-scale invasion, Russia has repeatedly invoked the threat of its nuclear arsenal to deter Western military support for Ukraine. In his General Assembly address, Lavrov called Western attempts to defeat Russia &quot;a suicidal escapade.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m not going to talk here about the senselessness and the danger of the very idea of trying to fight to victory with a nuclear power, which is what Russia is,&quot; Lavrov said. Lavrov&apos;s remarks come days after Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed revisions to Moscow&apos;s nuclear doctrine at a U.N. Security Council meeting. Putin announced that Russia could respond to conventional missile strikes with nuclear weapons, and indicated that Moscow would treat any attack backed by a nuclear-armed country as a coordinated assault. Lavrov also derided Ukraine&apos;s peace formula, calling it a &quot;doomed ultimatum&quot; while defending Russia&apos;s ongoing occupation of Ukrainian territory. Russia&apos;s escalating nuclear rhetoric coincides with President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s visit to Washington, where he continued to push U.S. President Joe Biden to allow Ukraine to use American weapons to strike targets deep within Russian. The U.S. announced around $8 billion in additional military aid for Ukraine during the visit, but did not signal any changes to its policy around long-range strikes. Zelensky&apos;s spokesperson, Serhii Nikiforov, said during an interview on Ukrainian television that Russia would be &quot;the first to know&quot; if restrictions on long-range attacks were lifted. &quot;First, it is important to understand that the first to learn about the authorization to strike deep into Russian territory will be the Russians themselves,&quot; Nikiforov said. &quot;They will be the first to know it, and then there will be an official announcement.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/west-should-not-fight-to-victory-against-nuclear-state-russian-fm-says-at-un/	2024-09-28T12:02:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174265841.jpg
Explosions damage railway bridge in Samara Oblast, Russian media reports	Explosions on a railway bridge in Russia&apos;s Samara Oblast have damaged the concrete structures supporting the track, the Russian Telegram news channel Baza reported on Sept. 28. An &quot;unknown device&quot; exploded at around 1:30 p.m. local time near the city of Kinel, Baza reported. The explosion set off car alarms in neighboring villages. A freight train was traveling along the bridge at the time of the explosion, but was not derailed. No casualties have been reported. The explosion damaged two concrete structures supporting the railway bridge. Eyewitnesses claimed they saw a suspicious vehicle driving away from the bridge shortly after the explosion, Baza reported. A number of sabotage attacks have been carried out against Russian railways since the beginning of the full-scale war. Earlier this month, on Sept. 11, Ukrainian reconnaissance and special forces reportedly blew up a railroad in Russia&apos;s Belgorod Oblast. In January 2024, sabotage attacks targeted train tracks in multiple cities in western Russia. &#xA0;Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) did not say whether it was involved in the attacks but said the actions would disrupt Russian military logistics. In November 2023, HUR claimed responsibility for a joint operation against train lines in Moscow Oblast. &#xA0; Around the same time, an explosion on Russia&apos;s far-eastern Baikal-Amur railway line was linked to the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU).	https://kyivindependent.com/explosions-damage-railway-bridge-in-samara-oblast-russian-media-reports/	2024-09-28T10:18:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1237502911.jpg
Russian colonel killed near Moscow, military intelligence says	Aleksey Kolomeitsev, a Russian colonel who trained specialists in the use of attack drones, was killed in the city of Kolomna in Moscow Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Sept. 28. Kolomeitsev, 51, led Russia&apos;s 924th State Center of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), a military unit responsible for training specialists to operate combat drones. The unit specialized in the use of Shahed drones, which Russia employs daily in mass aerial attacks against Ukraine. Kolomeitsev was found dead in Russia on Sept. 27, HUR reported. The Russian colonel was &quot;directly involved in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and war crimes against Ukraine,&quot; HUR said. While HUR did not disclose the details of Kolomeitsev&apos;s death or claim direct responsibility for the killing, the post said that &quot;every war crime will be punished with justice.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-colonel-killed-near-moscow-military-intelligence-says/	2024-09-28T09:25:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1489472156.jpg
Ukrainian Supreme Court judge killed in Russian drone attack	Leonid Loboyko, a judge on Ukraine&apos;s Supreme Court, was killed on Sept. 28 by a Russian drone strike in the village of Kozacha Lopan in Kharkiv Oblast. A Russian FPV drone struck a civilian vehicle on Sept. 28, killing the driver immediately, the Kharkiv Oblast regional prosecutor&apos;s office reported. The Supreme Court&apos;s press service later identified the victim as Loboyko. Loboyko, 61, was a Supreme Court judge of the Cassation Criminal Court. He was reportedly delivering humanitarian aid to residents of the village at the time of the attack. &quot;In the hearts of all who knew Leonid Loboyko, he will always be remembered as a kind, wise and compassionate person,&quot; the Supreme Court&apos;s press office said in a statement. Three women were also injured in the drone strike. They were in the vehicle when it was hit and have all been hospitalized. Attacks on civilian targets are a daily reality in Kharkiv Oblast. On the same day Loboyko was killed, a Russian airstrike on the village of Slatyne killed three people and injured three others. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-supreme-court-judge-killed-in-russian-drone-attack/	2024-09-28T09:04:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/car.jpg
Russian air strike in Kharkiv Oblast kills 3, injures 3	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A Russian air strike on the village of Slatyne in Kharkiv Oblast on Sept. 28 killed three people and injured at least three others, regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. The attack targeted civilian infrastructure, hitting an educational institution and shops while people were walking on the street, Syniehubov said. One of the victims, a woman, is in serious condition following the attack. No details have been reported on the remaining victims. All emergency services are at work on the scene, and the consequences of the strike are currently under investigation. Kharkiv Oblast borders Russia to the northeast. Repeated daily attacks are a fact of life for the residents of the embattled region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-air-strike-in-kharkiv-oblast-kills-3-injures-3/	2024-09-28T08:28:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2147873245.jpg
Russia preparing for assault operations in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukrainian military says	Russian troops appear to be preparing for assault operations in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where &quot;the enemy is amassing personnel,&quot; the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command spokesman Vladyslav Voloshyn said on Sept. 28. The statement comes as Russia continues to press forward on its offensives across the eastern front, primarily on the Pokrovsk, Vuhledar, and Toretsk axes in Donetsk Oblast, where the outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are forced to withdraw little by little. Speaking on national television, Voloshyn said, citing the Ukrainian military&apos;s intelligence data, that Russia is massing personnel for what could be a new manoeuver in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, particularly near the Russian-occupied village of Pryiutne located on the border with Donetsk Oblast. Voloshyn also said on television that Russian troops received 25 light buggies that could be used by small infantry groups for assaults. &quot;These are such signs of preparation for the fact that in the near future, assault actions will be carried out in the Zaporizhzhia direction,&quot; Voloshyn said, though stressing that it would require larger forces for a full-blown offensive. The spokesman suggested that the potential operation may be Russia&apos;s attempt at improving its tactical position in the area, but &#x201C;there is no talk of an offensive yet.&#x201D; The village of Pryiutne lies about 40 kilometers west of Vuhledar, a mining town that Russian troops have been trying to seize for more than two years. Russia has scaled up its offensive on Vuhledar in August, slowly gaining ground to encircle the town. The defense of Vuhledar is strategic as capturing the town would allow Moscow to form the southern flank, which is needed as a staging ground for a bigger push onto Pokrovsk &#x2013; a crucial Ukrainian-controlled logistic hub in the Donbas. Pryiutne is located about 70 kilometers southwest of Pokrovsk.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-preparing-for-assault-operations-in-zaporizhzhia-oblast-ukrainian-military-says/	2024-09-28T06:59:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2158959316.jpg
Advisor to Putin accuses West of isolating Kaliningrad by disrupting transit links	Nikolai Patrushev, an advisor to Russian President Vladimir Putin, accused the West on Sept. 27 of attempting to isolate Kaliningrad Oblast by disrupting transportation links between the exclave and mainland Russia. Speaking at a meeting in Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave between Poland and Lithuania on the Baltic Sea, Patrushev claimed Western nations are imposing &quot;maximum complications&quot; on cargo and passenger transit to the region. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Western countries have imposed sanctions aimed at curbing Russia&apos;s ability to continue the war. These sanctions have limited transportation links to Kaliningrad, Patrushev alleged. Russian state-controlled news agency TASS reported Patrushev as saying Moscow would shift the majority of road and rail cargo between Kaliningrad and mainland Russia to sea routes. He claimed 80% of goods &quot;necessary for the life and economy of the region&quot; cannot be transported by land. Patrushev, a former KGB officer reappointed in May to oversee shipbuilding after serving as secretary of the Security Council, also said Russia plans to prepare two ship and rail routes by 2028. Kaliningrad Oblast became Russian territory after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The strategic exclave is home to the Russian Baltic Fleet.	https://kyivindependent.com/advisor-to-putin-accuses-west-of-isolating-kaliningrad-by-disrupting-transit-links/	2024-09-28T05:18:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2151387932.jpg

As Russian losses in Ukraine surge, some military bloggers turn on Kremlin, military command	The Kremlin is facing a backlash from Russian military bloggers outraged at reports of specialist troops being sent to storm Ukrainian positions in order to maintain pressure on the front lines. Facing a shortage of manpower and a pressing need to maintain the grinding advances in eastern Ukraine, Russia has reportedly been throwing some of its most skilled troops into mass infantry attacks, and at very high costs. &quot;The past four months have proved the costliest for Russian forces since the war began in 2022,&quot; a U.K. Military Intelligence report on Sept. 23. The report said Russian casualties, both killed and wounded, were averaging over 1,000 a day, and were 1,262 in May, 1,163 in June, 1,140 in July, and 1,187 in August, adding the total number since the start of the full-scale invasion was &quot;likely over 610,000.&quot; &quot;It is expected that Russia&apos;s casualty rate will average more than 1,000 per day throughout September, as their soldiers are needlessly (killed) or wounded,&quot; it added. As the losses mount, some pro-Kremlin Russian military bloggers (milbloggers) are accusing authorities of ignoring an apparently widespread practice of using specialist troops as cannon fodder in mass infantry attacks. &quot;Specialists, the handicapped, wounded, and so on are sent to storm one way, and in some cases they will not even make it to the assault &#x2014; a needless death,&quot; prominent milblogger Anastasia Kashevarova said in a post on Telegram on Sept. 24. The bodies of killed Russian soldiers in the Bakhmut area in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine on June 29, 2024 (Pablo Miranzo/Anadolu via Getty Images)Despite hopes that Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Kursk Oblast would divert and slow Russian forces, Moscow&apos;s troops continue to make grinding advances in eastern Ukraine, leveraging in particular its advantage in manpower. &quot;Their tactics never change: they attack with quantity, and we fight them off with quality,&quot; one soldier defending the embattled town of Pokrovsk told the Kyiv Independent earlier this month. &quot;If we had that many people, that much ammunition, we would have fought all of them off a long time ago, but instead, we have shortages.&quot; Steven Wolff, Professor of International Security at the University of Birmingham, told the Kyiv Independent that Russia&apos;s huge losses are indicative of a Russian military mindset that has not changed in decades. &quot;Russian military doctrine is Soviet-style, and it always relied on the depth of Russia and its enormous resources, including manpower resources,&quot; he said. &quot;The way in which Stalin just threw millions of people at the Nazis in the 1940s, it&apos;s not very different to what (Russian President Vladimir) Putin does in this terrible war of aggression against Ukraine.&quot; In order to sustain this pool of manpower, Putin earlier this month signed a decree increasing the total number of Russian military personnel and staff by 180,000, to just under 2.4 million. The Russian milblogger community has recently been highlighting numerous cases where skilled and specialized troops have been sent to the front in order to maintain the levels of men required to keep up pressure at the front. Russian milblogger Roman Alekhine has described incidents in which Russian special forces officers, Aerospace Forces, and even sailors were being used to storm Ukrainian positions. &quot;Oh, yes, and rocket scientists too,&quot; he claimed in a post on his Telegram channel. &quot;And if&#x2026; they died in vain then it depends on us &#x2014; bloggers, military correspondents, journalists&#x2026; to convey to the Defense Ministry and the Supreme Council the information about systemic problems at the front.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s military has also noted a recent increase in specialist Russian troops taking part in infantry assaults. Speaking to Espresso TV on Sept. 5, a commander with the 60th Brigade&apos;s 97th Battalion said waves of repelled assaults using &quot;young and inexperienced soldiers&quot; in the Lyman sector had led to large losses for Russian forces. &quot;New reinforcements have not yet arrived, so the enemy is forced to use trained and well-equipped special forces units for assaults,&quot; he added. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) also reported on the trend on Sept. 24, saying the &quot;systematic misuse of Russian specialists&#x2026; indicates that Russia is struggling to meet the manpower demands of its war in Ukraine.&quot; Russian military cadets take part in a rehearsal of next May 9&apos;s 79th anniversary military parade celebrating Soviet Union&apos;s victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, on April 23, 2024 (Olga Maltseva/AFP via Getty Images)&#xA0;Compounding the high levels of losses, a recent scandal exposed the apparently common practice of transferring skilled and specialized troops to assault units and, in many cases, their deaths as punishment. Earlier this month, two Russian reconnaissance drone specialists Dmitriy Lysakovskiy and Sergey Gritsay &#x2014; call signs &quot;Goodwin&quot; and &quot;Ernest&quot; &#x2014;recorded a video in which they said their unit was being punished for reporting accurate information about the situation on the front lines. &quot;The entire long-range UAV drone unit was destroyed so that we&apos;d stop receiving actual front line information, and sent into the assault,&quot; one of the men says in the video, adding: &quot;Our regiment commander &apos;Zloy&apos; already reported the capture of Lesovka, and obviously it&apos;s a lie. It&apos;s not taken.&quot; &quot;This situation is not unique, it happens all across the front line. Lies are an absolute norm. It&apos;s normal to lie about capturing places,&quot; he adds. &quot;And I record this because there is a high chance I won&apos;t return from this assault.&quot; Both men were reportedly killed by a drone while storming Ukrainian positions. A very curious incident occurred for Russians in the Pokrovsk direction. We&apos;ve all heard when Russians send specialists like UAV operators and tankmen into meat assaults. In this case, one operator recorded a video before his death...1/ pic.twitter.com/b893g7mF3w The video gained traction among Russian milbloggers, prompting many to raise similar cases. The milblogger North Channel said the practice &quot;continues everywhere,&quot; while one of the most popular Russian milbloggers Rybar said it was endemic, and &quot;scoundrel commanders remain in power while truth-telling soldiers and officers die.&quot; &quot;Note that all this is not happening in some backwater where the army could fall apart, but in the most important direction, in the Pokrovsk area (where) the success of the entire strategic campaign of the Russian Armed Forces depends right now,&quot; another milblogger, artjockey, said on Telegram. &quot;There is no more important place on the entire front right now,&quot; they added. Such was the outcry that Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov initiated an investigation into the case of Goodwin and Ernest, the preliminary results of which were reported by a milblogger Alexander Kots earlier this week. According to his report, the investigation found Goodwin and Ernest&apos;s commander did nothing wrong by disbanding their drone unit and sending them to the front as infantry. Many milbloggers reacted to the report with fury, with one saying authorities were &quot;not interested either in an objective investigation of this particular case, or in correcting the situation in the army.&quot; But Wolff expects little to change, in large part because of a lack of outcry among the Russian public. &quot;There&apos;s also a particular mindset that makes that possible, where the Russian population just goes along with it because that&apos;s what they&apos;ve always done,&quot; he said. &quot;You can go back all the way to the Napoleonic wars, there&apos;s just an enormous capacity for suffering, and that doesn&apos;t excuse it, but it just makes it so much more acceptable in a way.&quot; A February poll from the Levada Center, an independent Russian polling organization, found that 77% of Russians supported the full-scale war in Ukraine, but a more recent survey suggests there may have been a shift in public mood in the months since. According to polls conducted by independent pollsters ExtremeScan and Chronicles in September 2024, 49% of Russians support the immediate withdrawal of troops from Ukraine and peace talks with Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/as-russian-losses-in-ukraine-surge-some-military-bloggers-turn-on-kremlin-military-command/	2024-09-28T03:55:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2151934692.jpg

Russian double-tap attack on Sumy hospital kills 6, injures 1, interior minister says	Russian forces launched a double-tap strike on a hospital in the northeastern city of Sumy, killing six people and injuring another, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said on Sept. 28. The initial attack claimed one life and caused extensive damage to several floors of the hospital, according to Klymenko. The second strike hit as rescuers and police arrived to evacuate patients to safety. &#x201C;As of now, six people are known to have died, including a policeman. Another policeman was wounded,&#x201D; Klymenko said in a Telegram post. The regional military administration reported that Russian troops targeted the healthcare facility around 8:30 a.m. local time with an airstrike and Shahed drones. About 10 minutes later, the Air Force confirmed Russian forces had also deployed powerful KAB-guided bombs in Sumy Oblast. In his Sept. 28 update, Klymenko noted it was the second consecutive day that Ukrainian police had suffered casualties. He added that search efforts were ongoing in Kryvyi Rih, where another worker might still be trapped beneath the rubble. For more than two years, Russia has indiscriminately attacked civilian infrastructure across Ukraine, striking hospitals, schools, and residential buildings in a campaign seemingly designed to erode the nation&#x2019;s morale. Since Ukraine&apos;s surprise cross-border operation into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast in August, launched from Sumy Oblast, the fighting has intensified around Sumy. The region had seen relative calm following Russia&#x2019;s withdrawal in the early months of the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-double-tap-attack-on-sumy-hospital-kills-6-injures-1-interior-minister-says/	2024-09-28T00:56:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/2024-09-28-10_59_28.jpg

Blinken criticizes China's Ukraine peace proposals following meeting with his counterpart	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed strong U.S. concerns to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Sept. 27 regarding China&apos;s support for Russia&apos;s defense industry, saying that Beijing&apos;s claims of seeking peace in Ukraine &quot;don&apos;t add up.&quot; During their meeting on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Blinken also criticized China&apos;s &quot;dangerous and destabilizing actions&quot; in the South China Sea and emphasized the need for improved communication between their militaries, Reuters reported. At a press conference, Blinken said that he and Wang also discussed strategies to curb the flow of drugs into the U.S. and addressed the risks associated with artificial intelligence. Blinken highlighted that approximately 70 percent of the machine tools and 90 percent of the microelectronics Russia is importing come from China and Hong Kong. That was materially helping Moscow to produce the missiles, rockets, armored vehicles and munitions needed to perpetuate its war, he said. &quot;So when Beijing says that, on the one hand, it wants peace, it wants to see an end to the conflict, but on the other hand, is allowing its companies to take actions that are actually helping (Vladimir) Putin continue the aggression, that doesn&apos;t add up,&quot; Blinked said. Wang said his country&apos;s position on the war in Ukraine had always emphasized the need for peace through talks, China&apos;s foreign ministry said in a statement.	https://kyivindependent.com/blinken-criticizes-chinas-ukraine-peace-proposals-following-beijing-meeting/	2024-09-27T18:51:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2160746692.jpg
Over 71,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine, media report suggests	More than 71,000 Russian soldiers have been confirmed to have been killed in Ukraine amid the full-scale war, according to a report by independent Russian media outlet Mediazona on Sept. 27. Mediazona, along with BBC News Russian, has been documenting the names of Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine through open-source research. Since Mediazona&apos;s last update in mid-September, the names of 1,998 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties. The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, regional media reports, and statements from local authorities. Since Russia began its all-out war against Ukraine over 4,100 officers have been killed in combat in Ukraine. The analysts also note that at least 13,175 Russian inmates have been killed on Ukraine&apos;s eastern front. According to Mediazona&apos;s estimates, a majority of those killed in action come from Rostov, Sverdlovsk, Bashkiria, and Chelyabinsk oblasts, as well as the Buryatia republic. According to the journalist, a surge of recruitment by the Kremlin in the predominantly Muslim regions of Bashkortostan and Tatarstan have also showed an increase in those killed in action in recent months. The last few month, amid the renewed Kharkiv offensive as well as Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Kursk Oblast, Russian forces have experienced some of its heaviest losses since the start of the full-scale war. According to undisclosed sources and Western intelligence estimates, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Sept. 17 that roughly 1 million Ukrainians and Russians have been killed or wounded since February 2022 - including civillians. The WSJ also claimed that 80,000 Ukrainian soldiers had died during the war and around 400,000 wounded - a number some Ukrainian lawmakers have rebuked as &quot;exaggerated.&quot; In February of this year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that 180,000 Russian troops had been killed since the start of the all-out war. The president said that over 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers were killed during the same time. Western officials gave similar estimates about Russian battlefield losses. As of Sept. 27, 2024, the Ukrainian military estimates Russian combat losses at 649,170 troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-71-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine-media-report-suggests/	2024-09-27T16:05:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1241060998.jpg
Paraguay becomes 95th country to join global peace summit communique, Zelensky says	Paraguay formally signed the global peace summit joint communique on Sept. 27, becoming the 95th country to add their signature onto the final communique, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced. Switzerland hosted Ukraine&apos;s global peace summit on June 15-16, with representatives of around 100 countries and organizations in attendance. Seventy-eight states and four organizations signed the final joint communique of the peace summit on June 16. Since then, multiple countries signed on the ever-expanding list of delegations. &quot;One more South American country has endorsed our Peace Formula, the UN Charter, and our vision for a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace for Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky wrote on X, adding that he was &quot;looking forward to further deepening political dialogue&quot; with more South American countries. The communique called to return the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant under full control of Ukraine, ensure uninterrupted manufacturing and supply of food products in Ukraine, secure full access to sea ports in the Black and Azov Seas, release all prisoners of war and return all deported Ukrainian children, among other things. Russia was not invited to join the inaugural global peace summit in June. Kyiv is planning to arrange the second global peace summit before the end of 2024, which Ukraine hopes will be held in either the Middle East or India. Despite hopes that Russia will participate in a second peace summit, Moscow has repeatedly signalled it will not take part in any future iterations of the Swiss-hosted peace summit.	https://kyivindependent.com/paraguay-becomes-95th-country-to-join-global-peace-summit-communique-zelensky-says/	2024-09-27T14:08:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/95177401e8873a3c1d40e58aa4f8bf30_1702214719_extra_large.jpeg
Ukraine launches program allowing foreigners to remotely start businesses in Ukraine	Ukraine has launched uResidency, a program enabling foreigners to start a business in the country remotely, Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov announced on Sept. 27 at the Lviv IT Arena, according to a Kyiv Independent journalist reporting from the event. The program offers foreign entrepreneurs favorable conditions for conducting business, including a 5% tax on profits, the ability to register remotely as individual entrepreneurs, and the ability to conduct business through a mobile application and website. Kyiv has long sought to open business opportunities as it seeks to regain economic investments and rebuild entrepreneurial opportunities lost throughout the duration of the war. &quot;Thanks to technology, we can create products that can attract funds to Ukraine and grow the brand of an innovative country. One of these products is the uResidency,&quot; Fedorov said. &quot;This is a revolutionary project that will not only offer foreigners a great service for doing business in Ukraine but also support the Ukrainian economy. There are only a few similar projects in the world.&quot; Despite what the name implies, no additional pathways for permanent residency in Ukraine are provided. Foreigners do not need to travel to Ukraine to obtain &quot;e-residency status&quot;. To do this, they just need to undergo a one-time offline verification at the Ukrainian consular office in their country of residence. Subsequently, this procedure will also take place online. The uResidency was implemented with the support of the European Union through projects implemented by the eGovernance Academy of Estonia. The uResidency members are also not required to handle financial accounting on their own, as the bank will do it for them as a tax agent The program is currently available to citizens of India, Pakistan, Thailand, and Slovenia. The first phase is expected to involve about 1,000 e-residents. According to Fedorov, the list of countries will be expanded in the future. The Digital Transformation Ministry continues to work towards the concept of &quot;the state in a smartphone,&quot; which was established in 2020 with the launch of the Diia app - a state mobile application for government services. Ukrainians can access digitized versions of various official documents, including their passport, driver&apos;s license, vehicle registration, or tax ID. It is also possible to do things like register a business or the birth of one&apos;s child on the app.Last year, President Zelensky announced that Ukraine was helping other countries in Europe, Latin America, and Africa to develop the equivalent of Diia.	https://kyivindependent.com/foreigners-to-become-e-residents-start-business-in-ukraine-remotely-digital-transformation-ministry-announces/	2024-09-27T12:47:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/tech.jpeg
Ukraine war latest: Zelensky meets with Trump in New York, shows him his 'victory plan'	Key developments on Sept. 27: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said everything possible must be done to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine. Zelensky made the remarks on Sept. 27 after meeting with Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump in New York City. &quot;This war should not have started. I think that the problem is that Putin killed so many people, and of course, we need to do everything to pressure him to stop this war,&quot; Zelensky said in a joint interview with Trump for Fox News. Zelensky met with Trump for the first time in five years during his trip to the U.S., where he held a series of high-level meetings with foreign leaders, visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant, and addressed the U.N. General Assembly. Ukraine&apos;s president also introduced Trump to his &quot;victory plan,&quot; which he had presented a day earlier to U.S. President Joe Biden and Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris. Following his meeting with Trump, Zelensky emphasized that Ukraine seeks only a just peace and relies on continued U.S. support in the ongoing full-scale war launched by Russia. Trump said he has &quot;learned a lot&quot; as the war continues but noted that his views on ending it &quot;as soon as possible&quot; have not changed. &quot;The president (Zelensky) wants it to end as quickly as possible. He wants a fair transaction to take place,&quot; Trump said. &quot;If I win (in the presidential election), we&apos;re going to have a very fair and, I think, rather rapid deal. It (the war) should stop, and the president (Zelensky) wants it to stop, and I&apos;m sure President Putin wants it to stop. And that&apos;s a good combination,&quot; Trump added. When asked how he sees the war ending, Trump evaded the question, saying it was &quot;too early&quot; to discuss and that both he and Zelensky had their &quot;own ideas&quot; on the matter. Zelensky and Trump did not disclose whether another meeting between them would take place soon. However, the Ukrainian president invited the Republican nominee to visit Ukraine, and Trump accepted the invitation. Recently, Trump&apos;s rhetoric toward Zelensky and U.S. support for Ukraine has become more critical. He has claimed that Zelensky wants Democrats to win the upcoming presidential election, referring to him as &quot;the greatest salesman on earth.&quot; Republican leaders on Sept. 25 also accused Zelensky of interfering in the election by visiting an ammunition factory in U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s hometown of Scranton, Pennyslvania, a hotly contested battleground state. House Speaker Mike Johnson demanded that Zelensky fire Ukraine&apos;s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Makarovka, for her role in arranging the tour. The Republican chair of the House Oversight Committee also announced he was opening an investigation into the Biden-Harris administration&apos;s alleged misuse of government funds. Zelensky criticized Trump&apos;s plans for an end to the war in an interview with the New Yorker earlier this week. He called Trump&apos;s running mate, Republican Senator J.D. Vance, &quot;too radical&quot; and said the war should not end at Ukraine&apos;s expense. Russia is attempting to bolster defenses around the Crimean Bridge using underwater drone traps, it was reported on Sept. 27. According to the Crimean Wind Telegram channel, the metal structures have been put in place using barges and a floating crane for the last month. An unverified photo accompanying the post showed a barge pulling what resembles a large section of metal fencing. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the report, but it comes a day after Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk said Russian forces were building a new but unidentified structure near the Crimean Bridge. &quot;It could be a defense structure, it could be another crossing, but it&apos;s a bit early to draw conclusions,&quot; he added. Construction on the 19-kilometer-long bridge began after the illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014 and was completed in 2018. After becoming a critical supply route for Russian forces after the launch of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion, it has been attacked by Kyiv&apos;s forces on several occasions, and was heavily damaged by Ukrainian strikes in October 2022 and July 2023. Ukraine is reported to have been testing an underwater sea drone dubbed Marichka, but scant details have been made public. The Crimean Bridge is currently the subject of a dispute between Ukraine and Russia at the Permanent Court of Arbitration Speaking there on Sept. 23, Ambassador-at-Large at the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, Anton Korynevych, said Russia &quot;wants to take the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait for itself.&quot; &quot;So it has built a great gate at their entrance, to keep international shipping out while allowing small Russian river vessels in,&quot; he said. &quot;The bridge is unlawful, and it must come down.&quot; U.S. intelligence agencies have cautioned that Russia may respond with increased force, potentially including lethal attacks on the U.S. and its allies, if Ukraine is allowed to use long-range missiles supplied by the U.S., U.K., and France for strikes deep into Russian territory, the New York Times reported. The news outlet cited a previously unreported assessment that also downplays the strategic impact these long-range missiles might have on the war, mentioning Ukraine&apos;s limited supply and the uncertainty over how many more Western nations may provide those missiles. The analysis underscores the significant risks and uncertain benefits of the decision, which now lies with President Joe Biden, following his meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House on Sept. 26. The difficulty in President Biden&apos;s decision-making on Ukraine&apos;s request for long-range missiles is partly rooted in concerns highlighted by U.S. intelligence, American officials told the New York Times. Zelensky has been pushing both publicly and privately to gain permission to target Russian territory with the advanced missiles. Vladimir Putin has regularly used threats to deter the U.S. and its allies from sending more sophisticated weaponry to Ukraine. Critics argue that Biden&#x2019;s administration has been overly cautious, claiming their slow, incremental approach to arming Ukraine has hurt their performance on the battlefield. On the other hand, supporters of the current strategy point to its effectiveness in avoiding major Russian retaliation, though they admit this balance may now be at risk. The intelligence assessment outlines a range of potential Russian reactions if the U.S. and European nations authorize Ukraine to carry out long-range strikes with their supplied missiles. These responses could include increased acts of sabotage and arson targeting infrastructure across Europe, and even potentially lethal attacks on military installations belonging to the U.S. and its allies. According to U.S. officials, most of the sabotage in Europe so far has been orchestrated by Russia&#x2019;s military intelligence agency (GRU). If Putin opts to escalate this covert campaign in response to missile strikes deep inside Russian territory, officials believe the Kremlin would likely continue to operate in the shadows, avoiding direct and open attacks on U.S. and European military facilities to prevent triggering a broader conflict. Kyiv did not conduct a Qatar-brokered &quot;exchange&quot; of children with Moscow, Ukraine&apos;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said on Sept. 27. Lubinets refuted an AFP report citing an unnamed Qatari official who claimed nine children and one adult had allegedly returned to Ukraine, while four children &quot;will be reunited with their families in Russia.&quot; under the agreement. According to the ombudsman, no deals were made between the two countries and the reports are &quot;promoting Russian narratives.&quot; Qatar has acted as a mediator between Kyiv and Moscow to bring back Ukrainian children illegally held by Russia. International humanitarian law does not provide for such a process as the exchange of children, Lubinets said. &quot;Ukraine has not kidnapped and does not hold Russian children on its territory, nor does it prevent their return to Russia if they are on our territory,&quot; he added. Over 19,500 children have been confirmed as abducted by Russia since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and less than 400 of them have been returned home, according to the Children of War database. An attack on Belarus would lead to World War III, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko claimed on Sept. 27, following Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s call to update Russia&apos;s nuclear doctrine, according to the Belarusian state-owned news agency Belta. Putin proposed a series of changes to Russia&apos;s nuclear doctrine on Sept. 25 during a Security Council meeting on nuclear deterrence. He announced that Russia could respond to conventional missile strikes with nuclear weapons and indicated that Moscow would treat any attack backed by a nuclear-armed country as a coordinated assault. He also stated that Russia retains the right to use nuclear weapons in the event of an attack, including if an enemy using conventional weapons poses a critical threat to Russia and Belarus. &quot;An attack on Belarus is World War III,&quot; Lukashenko said. &quot;Putin recently confirmed this by amending the nuclear doctrine, that in an attack on Russia and Belarus, we use nuclear weapons,&quot; Lukashenko added, thanking his Russian counterpart for the recent move. The Belarusian dictator claimed that NATO countries had allegedly deployed troops on the border with Belarus, specifically in Poland. &quot;The red line is the state border. If you step on it, there will be an immediate response. We are preparing for that,&quot; Lukashenko said. Russia&apos;s decision to modify its nuclear doctrine is a direct response to discussions in the U.S. and U.K. about whether to allow Ukraine to launch conventional Western missiles into Russian territory. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed on Sept. 26 that updates had been made to a document titled &quot;The Foundations of State Policy in the Sphere of Nuclear Deterrence.&quot; While Belarus doesn&apos;t have nuclear weapons of its own, Russia has allegedly moved some of its nuclear arsenal to Belarus.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-zelensky-meets-trump-presents-him-victory-plan-in-new-york-city/	2024-09-27T12:08:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174930490.jpg
Serhii Sukhomlyn named head of Ukraine's Agency for Restoration and Development of Infrastructure	Former Zhytomyr Mayor Serhii Sukhomlyn has been appointed head of the Agency for the Restoration and Development of Infrastructure, he announced on Facebook on Sept. 27. Sukhomlyn became mayor of Zhytomyr in November 2015 and resigned at his own request in early September 2024. Before Sukhomlyn, Mustafa Nayyem headed the agency specializing in Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction. Nayyem resigned on June 10 after being prevented from attending the Ukraine Recovery Conference scheduled for June 11-12 in Berlin. In a lengthy Facebook post, he outlined a series of complaints about &quot;systemic obstacles&quot; that limited his ability to do his job, ultimately leading to his decision to resign. Nayyem&apos;s resignation and reshuffles strained relations between Kyiv and Western allies, raising concerns about Ukraine&apos;s ability to address the ongoing attacks on its energy infrastructure by Russia, the Financial Times reported on June 10, citing unnamed Ukrainian and Western officials. Nayyem is also credited as one of the first activists to call for demonstrations in Kyiv in November 2013, marking the beginning of the protest movement that culminated in the EuroMaidan Revolution.	https://kyivindependent.com/government-appoints-new-infrastructure-development-head-after-controversial-predecessors-resignation/	2024-09-27T11:13:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1221786684.jpg

India won't buy from sanctioned Russian Arctic LNG 2 project, Indian oil secretary says	India will not purchase liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Russia&apos;s Arctic LNG 2 project, which has been sanctioned by Western countries, Indian Oil Secretary Pankaj Jain said on Sept. 27, Reuters reported. Arctic LNG 2, owned by Russia&#x2019;s Novatek, aims to produce nearly 20 million metric tons of LNG per year, primarily for Asian markets, potentially generating billions of dollars in revenue. The project was envisioned as Russia&apos;s largest LNG plant and a key part of its plan to become the world&apos;s leading LNG producer. Earlier this year, the U.K., along with the U.S. and the European Union, sanctioned Arctic LNG 2. &quot;We will not buy (from) Arctic LNG 2. We are not buying any sanctioned commodity. Something which has broad-based sanctions, we are not touching it,&quot; Jain said. India has maintained close economic and diplomatic ties with Moscow since February 2022, with bilateral trade reaching a record high in 2023. India overtook China as the world&#x2019;s largest importer of Russian oil in July as Chinese refiners bought less due to lower profit margins from fuel production, Reuters reported on Aug. 22, citing a comparison of import data. At the same time, India has been developing its relationship with Ukraine, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi visiting Kyiv in August, the first time an Indian prime minister set foot in Ukraine since diplomatic relations were established over 30 years ago. Modi&apos;s visit to Ukraine came just weeks after his trip to Moscow, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The visit included a widely criticized hug between the two leaders on July 8, hours after Russia bombed the Okhmatdyt children&apos;s hospital in Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/india-wont-buy-from-sanctioned-russian-arctic-lng-2-project-indian-oil-secretary-says/	2024-09-27T07:34:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1013825882.jpg

Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has admitted to cooperating with the proxy authorities in Ukraine&#x2019;s Russian-occupied Donetsk Oblast for over a decade, also reaffirmed his complicity in hosting children abducted by Russia from occupied Ukrainian territories. Lukashenko made the remarks during a meeting in Minsk on Sept. 19 with Denis Pushilin, the Kremlin-installed leader of the Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory. While Minsk hasn&#x2019;t formally recognized Russia&apos;s claim to have annexed the occupied territories of Ukraine, Lukashenko claimed that Belarus &#x201C;has always cooperated&#x201D; with occupied parts of Donetsk Oblast &#x201C;for the past ten years.&#x201D; The Belarusian dictator also admitted to hosting Ukrainian children abducted by the Russian authorities while claiming the abductions were for the purpose of &#x201C;recreation.&#x201D; &#x201C;We host your children for treatment and recreation,&#x201D; Lukashenko&#x2019;s press office quoted him as telling Pushilin. &#x201C;However, they threatened me with legal action for allegedly stealing your children. So I told both Ukraine and the United States, &#x2018;Please come and find at least one stolen child. It runs contrary to our principles.&#x2019;&#x201D; Ukraine&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry condemned the meeting and &#x201C;Lukashenko&#x2019;s hypocritical rhetoric,&#x201D; underscoring the dependency of Belarus&#x2019; policies on the Kremlin. &#x201C;The stance of the current Belarus authorities with regard to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine is being dictated exclusively by the Kremlin and has nothing to do either with international law or the international obligations of the Republic of Belarus,&#x201D; the Ukrainian ministry&#x2019;s statement reads. This was Pushilin&#x2019;s third visit to Belarus. Following the previous meeting of the two on April 18, 2023, in Minsk, Ukraine recalled its Ambassador, Ihor Kyzym, for consultations. Kyzym did not return to the Belarusian capital and was appointed Ambassador-at-Large to support Kyiv&#x2019;s dialogue with the Belarusian opposition in exile. Belarus, a close Kremlin ally, has been involved in the abduction of Ukrainian children from the Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine. Belarus officials have repeatedly confirmed their participation in the abductions, while describing the deportations as &#x201C;recuperation trips.&#x201D; According to official estimates, Russia has abducted over 20,000 children from the Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, although the true number is likely much higher. The International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague has issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Children&#x2019;s Rights Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova for their role in organizing the illegal transfer of Ukrainian children to Russia. The European Parliament has called on the ICC to issue a similar arrest warrant against Lukashenko for his complicity in the crime. Several human rights organizations, including Freedom House, Ukraine&apos;s Regional Human Rights Center, and Ukraine&#x2019;s Zmina Human Rights Center, have announced that they submitted to the ICC on Sept. 23 new evidence of the abduction, brainwashing, and militarizing of more than 2,219 children from Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories. The U.S. charge d&apos;affaires at the embassy in Minsk, Peter Kaufman, has condemned a Belarusian state-owned TV channel&apos;s broadcasting of a documentary featuring U.S.-Belarusian citizen and political prisoner Yury Ziankovich. During the broadcast, Ziankovich was shown pleading for help from U.S. presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. &#x201C;I resolutely condemn the Belarusian regime&#x2019;s reprehensible showing of a detained U.S. citizen on state media for propaganda purposes, and refute the baseless claims made in the program, &quot; reads a statement issued by Kaufman on Sep. 20. &#x201C;The regime&apos;s history of using coercive tactics to produce content like this strongly calls into question the voluntary nature of the U.S. citizen&apos;s participation.&#x201D; Kaufman reiterated the U.S. government&apos;s long-standing advice to U.S. citizens to avoid traveling to Belarus. The statement was released after the airing on Sep. 19 of the film, titled &#x201C;Murderous Conspiracy,&#x201D; on Belarusian television. It shows U.S.-Belarusian citizen and lawyer, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison on trumped-up charges of conspiracy to seize power, appealing to Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko for a pardon, as well as pleading to candidates Harris and Trump to help him return to his family in Houston, Texas. Filmed in prison, Ziankovich is said to have lost a significant amount of weight. Likely under duress, in the film he &#x201C;confesses&#x201D; to conspiring to seize power and gives details of alleged plans to overthrow the Lukashenko regime. The documentary aired as 115 Belarusian political prisoners &#x201C;pardoned&#x201D; by Lukashenko were released. According to Belarusian political analyst Valer Karbalevich, the broadcast was a &#x201C;bargaining offer to Washington&#x201D; from Lukashenko, who is likely testing the West&apos;s readiness for negotiations with his regime. As Lukashenko signed the fourth round of &#x201C;pardons&#x201D; releasing dozens of Belarusian political prisoners, his propaganda mouthpiece, Yury Vaskrasenski, urged &#x201C;the West (to have) discussions&#x201D; so that the process could continue. Over 1,300 political prisoners remain behind bars in Belarus following Lukashenko&#x2019;s four-year-long crackdown on dissent after the 2020 presidential election, which he claimed to have won but which was condemned by observers as neither free nor fair. J&#xF6;rg Dornau, a member of Saxony&#x2019;s State Parliament from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), uses Belarusian convicts &#x2013; including those jailed on political charges &#x2013; as labor on his onion plantation in Belarus, the independent Belarusian news outlet Reform.by claimed on Sept. 24. According to the outlet&#x2019;s investigation, Dornau&#x2019;s firm, Zybulka Bel, an agriculture company cultivating several hundred hectares planted with onions, signed a contract with the local Center for the Isolation of Offenders in Lida in western Belarus. As the Lukashenko regime ramped up the repressions against civil society following the disputed 2020 presidential elections in Belarus, the Centers for Isolation of Offenders have regularly held Belarusians sentenced to days of administrative arrest on politically motivated grounds. According to Human Rights Center Viasna, around 30,000 Belarusians underwent detention in 2020 alone. One of the laborers at Dornau&#x2019;s farm, sentenced to 15 days of arrest for liking an online post critical of the regime of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, described the working conditions as harsh. For 5 euros ($5.60) per day, the detainees sorted onions in an underground warehouse in freezing temperatures. The working day commenced at 7 a.m. and finished at 6 p.m. with no breaks or meals provided. According to the report, the labor was not forced; Dornau&#x2019;s foreman collected signed consent forms for daily work and monitored the quality of the labor performed. The funds prisoners earned were reportedly used to cover the costs of their detention. As of 2023, the cost of administrative arrest that prisoners are obliged to pay is roughly $5.70 per day. Dornau himself is claimed to have inspected the work of the farm in person at least once, with one prisoner describing a visit by a &#x201C;tall, bald man&#x201D; similar to Dornau arriving in a German-registered car. Dornau&#x2019;s press office has declined to comment on Reform.by&#x2019;s report. Dornau established Zybulka Bel&#x2019;s operations in Belarus in October 2020 while nationwide pro-democracy protests were still sweeping the streets of Belarus. His business relations with Belarus were not revealed until April 2024. While conducting business is not prohibited for members of parliament under Saxony&#x2019;s legislation, Dornau was fined 20,862 euros for failing to disclose his economic interests. The European Union has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on Belarus for the Lukashenko regime&#x2019;s ongoing human rights violations and its complicity with Russia&#x2019;s aggression against Ukraine. The European Parliament issued a resolution on Belarusian political prisoners on Sept. 19, calling on Serbia to refrain from extraditing Belarusian activist Andrey Hnyot, and noting that the Belarusian regime was abusing Interpol&#x2019;s arrest warrant system. Detained in October 2023 under an Interpol &#x201C;Red Notice&#x201D; international arrest warrant, Hnyot has for a year been battling in the Serbian courts to avoid being extradited to Belarus, where, he claims, he would face prison and torture. While the Serbian Appeals Court recently ordered a retrial, the risk of his eventual extradition remains. MEPs also expressed concern that the estimated 300,000 Belarusians who have fled Belarus since 2020 now risk political persecution in absentia. The EU parliament resolution, adopted with 549 votes in favor, 21 against, and 37 abstentions, demands that the Belarusian authorities unconditionally release all political prisoners, and provide lawyers, family members, and the Red Cross access to the most prominent political prisoners held incommunicado for over a year. It also calls for further sanctions against those involved in organizing repression in Belarus. Following the disputed 2020 presidential election, which Lukashenko claimed to have won by a landslide, mass protests erupted across Belarus. The protests were met by a violent government crackdown, leading to mass arrests and detentions of over 65,000 Belarusians. Human rights organizations say some 1,300 political prisoners are now behind bars, and around 300,000 Belarusians are in exile.

The deal, reached after six months of negotiations and first announced on Feb. 14, is now subject to regulatory approval. Upon completion, the deal will mark RBI&#x2019;s full exit from the Belarusian market, reducing &#x201C;operational complexity in line with its risk mitigation strategy in Eastern Europe,&#x201D; as per a press release from the bank. RBI expects to suffer a loss of around EUR 300 million ($335 million), which it said &#x201C;essentially results from the difference between the purchase price and the book value of the equity of Priorbank.&#x201D; The last major Western bank remaining in Russia and Belarus &#x2013; the Kremlin&#x2019;s accomplice in its aggressive war against Ukraine &#x2013; RBI has come under heavy criticism from Western institutions for continuing to do business in Russia and Belarus, and thus indirectly financing Russia&#x2019;s war by paying taxes to those countries. The General Assembly of the International Chess Federation FIDE voted on Sept. 22 to uphold a ban on chess teams from Russia and Belarus competing in international events. FIDE banned both countries from its events in the wake of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and prohibited holding any of its events on Russian and Belarusian territory. However, individual Russian and Belarusian players were allowed to participate under the neutral FIDE flag. During a meeting in Budapest, 21 delegates supported lifting the ban, whereas 41 countries voted not to admit players at all. With 66 votes in favor, the federation supported a last-minute proposal to consult the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow some Russian and Belarusian disabled and junior teams to participate in international chess events. The FIDE Council still has to approve the decision, although there is no expectation that it will be overturned. The proposal to reinstate Russia and Belarus&#x2019; participation in FIDE tournaments was made on June 5 by the Kyrgyz Chess Federation. It provided no arguments to support its proposal. Ahead of the General Assembly of the International Chess Federation, 13 Ukrainian chess players sent a letter to FIDE supporting the ban of Russian and Belarusian players from competitions due to the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. During FIDE&#x2019;s Greatest Of All Time award in Budapest, the award&#x2019;s winner, Grandmaster Magnus Carlsen, spoke against reinstating the Russian and Belarusian chess federations.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-lukashenko-admits-to-decade-long-cooperation-with-occupied-donetsk/	2024-09-27T05:55:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2162854097.jpg
Ukraine's Achilles drone strike battalion releases video of failed Russian assault in Kharkiv Oblast	A Russian assault near the village of Pishchane in Kharkiv Oblast was repelled, and dozens of vehicles damaged and destroyed, the Achilles drone strike battalion of Ukraine&apos;s 92nd Separate Special Forces Brigade claimed on Sept. 27. Commander Yurii Fedosenko said Moscow&apos;s forces had attempted to advance toward Kolesnykivka and Kruhliakivka the previous day, using around 50 armored vehicles and troops. Footage shared by Fedosenko show repeated Ukrainian FPV drone strikes on Russian vehicles which reportedly destroyed 14, and damaged 26 pieces of Russian military equipment, including infantry fighting vehicles and tanks. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Pishchane is located some 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the town of Kupiansk in eastern Kharkiv Oblast. Twenty engagements took place in the Kupiansk sector over the past day, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said. 0:00/1&#xD7;Another Russian attack was repelled in the Kurakhove sector in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s 79th Tavrian Air Assault Brigade said on Sept. 22. This week, Ukrainian forces also recaptured an aggregate plant in the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported. The intensity of fighting in the area has decreased somewhat compared to other sectors in Ukraine&apos;s east near Pokrovsk, Vuhledar and Toretsk.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-repels-russian-attack/	2024-09-27T04:57:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/--------------2024-09-27-141103.png
Crimean bridge defenses being bolstered by underwater drone traps, according to reports	Russia is attempting to bolster defenses around the Crimean Bridge using underwater drone traps, it was reported on Sept. 27. According to the Crimean Wind Telegram channel, the metal structures have been put in place using barges and a floating crane for the last month. An unverified photo accompanying the post showed a barge pulling what resembles a large section of metal fencing. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the report, but it comes a day after Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk said Russian forces were building a new but unidentified structure near the Crimean Bridge. &quot;It could be a defense structure, it could be another crossing, but it&apos;s a bit early to draw conclusions,&quot; he added. Construction on the 19-kilometer-long bridge began after the illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014 and was completed in 2018. After becoming a critical supply route for Russian forces after the launch of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion, it has been attacked by Kyiv&apos;s forces on several occasions, and was heavily damaged by Ukrainian strikes in October 2022 and July 2023. Ukraine is reported to have been testing an underwater sea drone dubbed Marichka, but scant details have been made public. &#x26A1;&#xFE0F;More detailed footage showing the design and appearance of the Marichka underwater multi-purpose drone developed by &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1E6;Ukrainian inventors pic.twitter.com/NQBDzgtEWf The Crimean Bridge is currently the subject of a dispute between Ukraine and Russia at the Permanent Court of Arbitration Speaking there on Sept. 23, Ambassador-at-Large at the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, Anton Korynevych, said Russia &quot;wants to take the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait for itself.&quot; &quot;So it has built a great gate at their entrance, to keep international shipping out while allowing small Russian river vessels in,&quot; he said. &quot;The bridge is unlawful, and it must come down.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/crimean-bridge-defenses-being-bolstered-by-metal-drone-traps-media-reports/	2024-09-27T04:15:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/2024-09-27-13_56_44.jpg
Top Orban aide sparks outrage by calling Ukraine's resistance to Russia's full-scale invasion 'irresponsible'	A top aide of Hungary&apos;s Prime Minister Viktor Orban has criticized Ukraine&apos;s resistance to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, calling it &quot;irresponsible&quot; and suggesting his country would have advised against fighting back if it had been asked. Balazs Orban &#x2013; no relation to the prime minister &#x2013; made the comments when discussing Hungary&apos;s anti-Soviet uprising in 1956 which was brutally put down by the Red Army. &quot;Considering 1956, we would have probably not done what President Zelensky did 2.5 years ago, as it is irresponsible, as we can see that he led his country into a defensive war, many lives were lost and territories lost,&quot; he said in an interview published Sept. 26. &quot;Let me say again, it is (Ukraine&apos;s) right and sovereign decision... but had they asked us, we would have not recommended this, based on what happened in 1956.&quot; In a post on Facebook, Hungary&apos;s leading opposition figure Peter Magyar said the aide &quot;has no place in public life after his scandalous and traitorous comments.&quot; Speaking on national radio on Sept. 27, in comments reported by Reuters, Orban claimed his aide&apos;s words were an error and emphasized that people should speak &quot;very carefully and clearly&quot; on such matters. &quot;Now my political director made an ambiguous statement which is a mistake, as our community stands on the basis of the 1956 revolution has grown from it,&quot; he said. Hungary is widely regarded as a key ally of Russia in the EU. Orban has repeatedly blocked aid to Ukraine, pushed for negotiations, and frequently spouted Kremlin talking points. Hungary has also condemned the war but has refused to supply Ukraine with weapons. Since taking the presidency of the European Commission in July, Orban has amped up attempts to stand as a negotiator between Moscow and Kyiv. In July, he embarked on a &#x201C;peace tour&#x201D; and met with Russian dictator Putin, Chinese leader Xi Jinping, and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Orban&apos;s visits sparked criticism from the EU and President Volodymyr Zelensky. The latter said that NATO and the EU can resolve the war without Orban. In early July, Hungary quietly changed the rules for its National Card program to allow Russian and Belarusian &quot;guest workers&quot; to enter the country in a streamlined visa-acquisition process that does away with enhanced security checks or other restrictions. In response to the policy change, European parliamentarians published a letter urging parliament to reconsider Hungary&apos;s Schengen membership. Earlier on Aug. 22, Ukrainian refugees from southwestern Zakarpattia Oblast began being evicted from shelters after in Hungary after the government passed a decree to restrict housing assistance for Ukrainians fleeing their country.	https://kyivindependent.com/top-orban-aide-sparks-outrage-by-calling-ukraine-resistance-to-russian-invasion-irresponsible/	2024-09-27T03:03:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169793556.jpg
Ombudsman denies reports on Qatar-brokered Ukraine-Russia deal on 'children exchange'	Kyiv did not conduct a Qatar-brokered &quot;exchange&quot; of children with Moscow, Ukraine&apos;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said on Sept. 27. Lubinets refuted an AFP report citing an unnamed Qatari official who claimed nine children and one adult had allegedly returned to Ukraine, while four children &quot;will be reunited with their families in Russia.&quot; under the agreement. According to the ombudsman, no deals were made between the two countries and the reports are &quot;promoting Russian narratives.&quot; Qatar has acted as a mediator between Kyiv and Moscow to bring back Ukrainian children illegally held by Russia. International humanitarian law does not provide for such a process as the exchange of children, Lubinets said. &quot;Ukraine has not kidnapped and does not hold Russian children on its territory, nor does it prevent their return to Russia if they are on our territory,&quot; he added. Over 19,500 children have been confirmed as abducted by Russia since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and less than 400 of them have been returned home, according to the Children of War database.	https://kyivindependent.com/ombudsmen-denies-reports-on-qatar-brokered-ukraine-russia-deal-on-children-exchange/	2024-09-27T02:31:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1752126674.jpg
Russian missile hits administrative building in Kryvyi Rih, governor says	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. A Russian missile attack has struck an administrative building in the city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Governor Serhii Lysak reported on Sept. 27. People may be trapped under the rubble, Lysak said. There is no further information on casualties at this time. An explosion was reported in Kryvyi Rih almost immediately after an air raid alert went off. Kryvyi Rih, with a population of around 660,000, is the second most populous city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. It has suffered multiple deadly attacks by Russian forces since the outbreak of the full-scale war. At least 53 people were injured in the Russian missile attack on Kryvyi Rih on July 8. The strike also killed 10 people, local authorities said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-hits-administrative-building-in-kryvyi-rih/	2024-09-27T00:04:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1241638872.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 8, injure 49 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed eight people and injured at least 49 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Sept. 27. Ukrainian forces downed 24 out of 32 Shahed-type drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. One more drone was &quot;lost,&quot; and another entered Romanian airspace, it added. Russia also fired a North Korean Iskander M/KN-23 missile and two Kh-22 cruise missiles at Ukraine, the statement said. Russian drones attacked the town of Izmail in southern Odesa Oblast, killing three people and injuring at least 11, including a child, Governor Oleh Kiper said. Two women born in 1934 and 1955 as well as a 73-year-old man were killed. The attack damaged houses, apartment buildings, and cars, causing several fires that were put out, according to the governor. The aftermath of a Russian attack on the town of Izmail in Odesa Oblast overnight on Sept. 27, 2024. (Oleh Kiper/Telegram)Two people were killed in the town of Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Two more people were killed in the settlements of Chasiv Yar and Siversk. A total of 11 people suffered injuries in the region over the past day, Filashkin added. A Russian attack on the city of Kharkiv injured three women and two men, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Three men, aged 77, 74 and 46, suffered injuries after Russian attacks on Kupiansk, Vuzlovyi, Vovchansk and Ivashky in Kharkiv Oblast. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 24 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. One person was killed and 19 were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-8-injure-49-over-past-day/	2024-09-26T23:47:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2024-09-27_09-25-04.jpg
Russia building unknown structure near Crimean Bridge, Ukraine's Navy says	Russia is building a new but unidentified structure near the Crimean Bridge, Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk said on national television on Sept. 26. The purpose of the construction is not yet currently known for certain, Pletenchuk said, adding that it is unlikely to be completed &quot;this season.&quot; &quot;It could be a defense structure, it could be another crossing, but it&apos;s a bit early to draw conclusions,&quot; he said. Construction on the 19-kilometer-long bridge began after the illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014 and was completed in 2018. The bridge connects the Russian mainland with the Russian-occupied Crimean peninsula and became a critical supply route for Russian forces after the launch of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Pletenchuk said that no matter what the structure is, deteriorating weather conditions as winter approaches will make it difficult to complete. &quot;They are constantly trying to place something new in the Kerch Strait, to build various hydrotechnical or barrier structures. But periodically they end up on the shore after another storm,&quot; he said. The bridge was heavily damaged by Ukrainian strikes in October 2022 and July 2023. Following these attacks, Russian proxies further fortified the bridge with underwater barriers. Russian proxy authorities in occupied Crimea regularly shut down traffic on the bridge amid reports of explosions and drone strikes. According to Ukraine&apos;s Navy, destroying the Crimean Bridge now would not have the same effect now because Russia barely uses it for military purposes anymore. Vasyl Maliuk, head of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), did not rule out that Russia may try to use the structure for weapons supplies again after it is fully restored. The Crimean Bridge is currently the subject of a dispute between Ukraine and Russia at the Permanent Court of Arbitration Speaking there on Sept. 23, Ambassador-at-Large at the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, Anton Korynevych, said Russia &quot;wants to take the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait for itself.&quot; &quot;So it has built a great gate at their entrance, to keep international shipping out while allowing small Russian river vessels in,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;The bridge is unlawful, and it must come down.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-building-new-structure-near-kerch-bridge-in-occupied-crimea-navy-says/	2024-09-26T22:58:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1243955050.webp

Blinken to hold talks with Chinese counterpart amid worries about China's drone assistance to Russia	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to meet Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Sept. 27 during the United Nations General Assembly in New York. This meeting between the top diplomats of both countries comes in response to increasing U.S. concerns regarding Chinese companies supplying chips and drones to Moscow, significantly enhancing Russia&apos;s military capabilities in its ongoing war against Ukraine. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell has informed Congress that China&apos;s material support for Russia&apos;s war effort &quot;comes from the very top,&quot; the Voice of America (VOA) reported. Blinken&apos;s discussions with Wang will occur before a scheduled call between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, anticipated later this fall. Earlier this week, President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the U.N. General Assembly, asserting that Ukraine would never accept a deal imposed by other nations to conclude Russia&#x2019;s 31-month invasion, and questioned the intentions of China and Brazil in advocating for negotiations with Moscow. For months, U.S. officials have accused China of actively supporting Russia&apos;s war effort. Washington has placed sanctions on Chinese firms supplying critical components to Russia&apos;s defense sector. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller recently told VOA that the U.S. openly discusses its &quot;differences&quot; with China to ensure both countries &quot;at least understand where the other is coming from, even if we can&#x2019;t reach an agreement.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/blinken-to-hold-talks-with-chinese-counterpart-amid-worries-about-chinas-drone-assistance-to-russia/	2024-09-26T21:59:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2158488146.jpg
Kremlin says recent adjustments to Russia's nuclear policy intended as a message to Western nations	The Kremlin on Sept. 26 emphasized that President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s revisions to Russia&#x2019;s nuclear weapons doctrine should serve as a warning to Western nations, making clear that involvement in attacks on Russia would carry serious repercussions. A day earlier, Putin announced that Russia could respond to conventional missile strikes with nuclear weapons, and indicated that Moscow would treat any attack backed by a nuclear-armed country as a coordinated assault. Russia&apos;s decision to modify its nuclear doctrine is a direct response to discussions in the U.S. and U.K. about whether to allow Ukraine to launch conventional Western missiles into Russian territory. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed that updates had been made to a document titled &quot;The Foundations of State Policy in the Sphere of Nuclear Deterrence.&quot; When asked if these changes were intended as a message to the West, Peskov said: &quot;This should be considered a definite signal.&quot; Peskov emphasized that Russia&apos;s updated nuclear doctrine serves as &quot;a signal that warns these countries about the consequences if they participate in an attack on our country by various means, and not necessarily nuclear ones.&quot; He added that the world is witnessing an &quot;unprecedented confrontation&quot; provoked by the &quot;direct involvement of Western countries, including nuclear powers,&quot; in the war in Ukraine. &quot;Russia&apos;s nuclear rhetoric is dangerous and reckless,&quot; outgoing NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said at the Council on Foreign Relations, according to Reuters. &quot;We are closely watching what Russia is doing.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-says-recent-adjustments-to-russias-nuclear-policy-intended-as-a-message-to-western-nations/	2024-09-26T20:32:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2158007453.jpg
US intelligence warns of risks in permitting Ukraine's long-range strikes, NYT reports	U.S. intelligence agencies have cautioned that Russia may respond with increased force, potentially including lethal attacks on the U.S. and its allies, if Ukraine is allowed to use long-range missiles supplied by the U.S., U.K., and France for strikes deep into Russian territory, the New York Times reported. The news outlet cited a previously unreported assessment that also downplays the strategic impact these long-range missiles might have on the war, mentioning Ukraine&apos;s limited supply and the uncertainty over how many more Western nations may provide those missiles. The analysis underscores the significant risks and uncertain benefits of the decision, which now lies with President Joe Biden, following his meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House on Sept. 26. The difficulty in President Biden&apos;s decision-making on Ukraine&apos;s request for long-range missiles is partly rooted in concerns highlighted by U.S. intelligence, American officials told the New York Times. Zelensky has been pushing both publicly and privately to gain permission to target Russian territory with the advanced missiles. Vladimir Putin has regularly used threats to deter the U.S. and its allies from sending more sophisticated weaponry to Ukraine. Critics argue that Biden&#x2019;s administration has been overly cautious, claiming their slow, incremental approach to arming Ukraine has hurt their performance on the battlefield. On the other hand, supporters of the current strategy point to its effectiveness in avoiding major Russian retaliation, though they admit this balance may now be at risk. The intelligence assessment outlines a range of potential Russian reactions if the U.S. and European nations authorize Ukraine to carry out long-range strikes with their supplied missiles. These responses could include increased acts of sabotage and arson targeting infrastructure across Europe, and even potentially lethal attacks on military installations belonging to the U.S. and its allies. According to U.S. officials, most of the sabotage in Europe so far has been orchestrated by Russia&#x2019;s military intelligence agency (GRU). If Putin opts to escalate this covert campaign in response to missile strikes deep inside Russian territory, officials believe the Kremlin would likely continue to operate in the shadows, avoiding direct and open attacks on U.S. and European military facilities to prevent triggering a broader conflict.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-intelligence-warns-of-risks-in-permitting-ukraines-long-range-strikes-nyt-reports/	2024-09-26T18:28:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173419941.jpg
Trump says he will meet with Zelensky at Trump Tower in New York on Sept. 27	Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Sept. 26 that he would meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky at Trump Tower in New York City on Sept. 27. The previous day, the AP reported, citing sources from Trump&apos;s campaign, that there was no meeting planned between the two. Zelensky has been in the U.S. since Sept. 22, where he has held a series of high-level meetings with foreign leaders, as well as a visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Pennsylvania and an address to the U.N. General Assembly. Trump&apos;s rhetoric against Zelensky and U.S. support for Ukraine has grown harsher in recent days. He has claimed that Zelensky wants Democrats to win the upcoming presidential election and referred to him as &quot;the greatest salesman on earth.&quot; Earlier on Sept. 26, Trump shared a screenshot of a message purportedly from Zelensky on Truth Social. The message, which cannot be independently verified, reportedly carried a personal request from Zelensky to meet with Trump. &quot;Days ago, we requested a meeting with you, and I really want to hear your thoughts directly, and firsthand. You know I always speak with great respect about everything connected to you, and that&apos;s how it should be,&quot; the message read. &quot;I believe it&apos;s important for us to have a personal contact and to understand each other 100%.&quot; Trump announced the meeting shortly after he shared the post. During his comments to the press, Trump declined to answer if he thought that Ukraine should cede territory in exchange for peace. Senator J.D. Vance, his running mate, said earlier in September that Trump&apos;s plan to end Russia&apos;s war could include the establishment of a special demilitarized zone between Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine would retain its sovereignty, but at the same time, it would have to give guarantees to Russia that it would not join NATO or any other allied institutions, Vance added. Trump has regularly repeated that if elected, he would end the full-scale war within 24 hours. However, when asked by reporters during his announcement of the meeting with Zelensky how he envisioned the end of the war, he said, &quot;I don&apos;t want to tell you what that looks like.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-says-he-will-meet-with-zelensky-at-trump-tower-in-new-york-on-sept-27/	2024-09-26T16:20:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173999809.jpg
Harris criticizes calls for concessions from Ukraine during joint press conference with Zelensky in Washington	U.S. Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and President Volodymyr Zelensky gave a joint press conference in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 26, ahead of their in-private meeting. Zelensky has been in the U.S. since Sept. 22, where he has held a series of high-level meetings with foreign leaders, as well as a visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Pennsylvania and an address to the U.N. General Assembly. Zelensky thanked Harris for her commitment to Kyiv and said, &quot;we are grateful to America for supporting Ukraine.&quot; In her remarks, Harris reiterated her support for Ukraine and warned that a Russian victory would lead to further aggression and cause other nations with imperialist ambitions to be &quot;emboldened.&quot; Harris said that she had &quot;told world leaders (at the U.N.), nothing about the end of this war can be decided without Ukraine.&quot; But she added that &quot;there are some in my country who would instead force Ukraine to give up large parts of its sovereign territory, who would demand that Ukraine accept neutrality, and would require Ukraine to forego security relationships with other nations.&quot; &quot;These proposals are the same as those of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, and let us be clear, these are not proposals for peace. Instead, they are proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable.&quot; While she did not mention anyone by name, some in the Republican Party, reportedly including presidential nominee Donald Trump, have suggested that Ukraine could cede territory in exchange for peace. At a rally on Sept. 24, Trump vowed to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the war in Ukraine if elected president. Trump&apos;s rhetoric against Zelensky and U.S. support for Ukraine has grown harsher in recent days. He has claimed that Zelensky wants Democrats to win the upcoming presidential election and referred to him as &quot;the greatest salesman on earth.&quot; Republican Vice Presidential nominee J.D. Vance said in an interview with Shawn Ryan earlier in September that Trump&apos;s plan to end Russia&apos;s war could include the establishment of a special demilitarized zone between Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine would retain its sovereignty, but at the same time, it would have to give guarantees to Russia that it would not join NATO or any other allied institutions, Vance added.	https://kyivindependent.com/harris-zelensky-hold-joint-press-conference-in-washington/	2024-09-26T15:48:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174706977.jpg
Zelensky meets with Biden in Washington, presents 'victory plan'	President Volodymyr Zelensky met with U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 26. The two held talks &quot;to discuss U.S. support for Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression,&quot; the White House said in a statement. Zelensky also presented Biden with his much-discussed victory plan. The details of the plan have not yet been made public, but the White House said that the two leaders discussed its &quot;diplomatic, economic, and military aspects.&quot; Separately, Zelensky wrote on X that he and Biden had talked about &quot;details to strengthen the plan, coordinated our positions, views, and approaches, and tasked our teams with holding consultations on the next steps.&quot; During the meeting with @POTUS, I presented the Victory Plan to him. We discussed details to strengthen the Plan, coordinated our positions, views, and approaches, and tasked our teams with holding consultations on the next steps.We deeply appreciate that Ukraine and the United&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/ow67qHZqF9 &quot;Russia will not prevail in (this) war,&quot; Biden said in the recorded remarks shared by Zelensky. &quot;Ukraine will prevail, and we will continue to stand by you every step of the way.&quot; In response, Zelensky said that &quot;we deeply appreciate that Ukraine and the U.S. have stood side-by-side from the very first moments of this terrible Russian invasion.&quot; &quot;Your determination is incredibly important for us to prevail.&quot; During Zelensky&apos;s visit to the U.S., Ukraine received pledges of new military aid from allies, including almost $8 billion from the U.S., as well other aid from the U.K., Germany, and Canada. The White House also said Biden would &quot;host a leader-level meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Germany (in October), where the two leaders will review progress on these consultations and coordinate with international partners on additional assistance for Ukraine.&quot; The statement concluded with a declaration that &quot;Biden is determined to provide Ukraine with the support it needs to win.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-with-biden-in-washington-presents-victory-plan/	2024-09-26T14:18:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173768341.jpg
White House defends Zelensky's ammunition plant visit, calls Republican investigation 'political stunt'	White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre pushed back on calls from top Republicans to investigate President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s recent visit to a Pennsylvania ammunition plant, telling reporters on Sept. 26 that it was a &quot;political stunt&quot; and that they &quot;need to drop this.&quot; Zelensky visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant on Sept. 22, along with Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro and other Democratic politicians from the state, to thank workers for producing critically needed 155 mm shells for Ukraine. Following the visit, Republican Congressman James Comer, who chairs the House Oversight Committee, announced on Sept. 25 that he was opening up an investigation into the White House&apos;s &quot;misuse of government resources.&quot; Later in the day, House Speaker Mike Johnson, also a Republican, wrote a letter to Zelensky demanding that Ukraine&apos;s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, be fired for alleged &quot;election interference.&quot; Johnson argued that Markarova had arranged a taxpayer-funded trip to a battleground state that &quot;purposely excluded&quot; Republicans ahead of the U.S. presidential election. Jean-Pierre dismissed the investigation into the visit as a partisan effort from Republicans. She said the Ukrainian delegation had asked to visit the plant, and the Department of Defense (DoD) arranged for their transportation, &quot;which is common.&quot; The press secretary added that Zelensky had visited Utah&apos;s Republican Governor Spencer Cox in July to address the National Governors Association and that &quot;there was not a single demand for an investigation&quot; after the trip from Republicans. Zelensky&apos;s visit to the ammunition plant was &quot;business as usual for a Ukrainian request during wartime,&quot; Jean-Pierre said.	https://kyivindependent.com/white-house-defends-zelenskys-ammunition-plant-visit-says-calls-for-investigation-political-stunt/	2024-09-26T13:31:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GYHWiqJWoAAna_c.jpeg
Deepfake' caller posing as Ukraine's ex-foreign minister talks to US Senator	U.S. Senator Benjamin Cardin received a Zoom call from an unknown person claiming to be former Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, the New York Times (NYT) reported on Sept. 26, citing a letter from the Senate security service and its undisclosed sources. The senator&apos;s office received an email from a person posing as Kuleba on Sept. 19 requesting to contact him via a Zoom call. During the video call, the person looked and spoke like Ukraine&apos;s former foreign minister. The senator became suspicious when the person posing as Kuleba began to behave atypically, asking &quot;politically charged questions in relation to the upcoming election&quot; and demanding opinions on sensitive foreign policy issues such as the launch of long-range missiles into Russian territory, the media outlet wrote. The senator ended the conversation and informed the State Department, which confirmed that the person introducing himself as Kuleba was an impostor who had used &quot;deepfake&quot; technology. Deepfake video technology uses artificial intelligence to create videos with fictional people who look and sound like real ones. This technology has also been used to impersonate public figures, such as in 2022, when a video that purported to show President Volodymyr Zelensky announcing Ukraine&apos;s surrender in the war with Russia was circulated on social media. The video was later debunked. &#xA0; While the Senate security email did not specify that Cardin was involved, two Senate officials familiar with the matter confirmed it to the NYT. Cardin, a Democrat from Maryland and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also confirmed in a statement on Sept. 25 that &quot;the malign actor&quot; had fraudulently attempted to communicate with him by posing as a &quot;known individual.&quot; Cardin did not specify that the &quot;known individual&quot; was Kuleba. It was not clear at first who had organized the operation against Cardin, the NYT said. Intelligence officials have warned that foreign actors such as Russia, Iran, and China are using artificial intelligence, including &quot;deepfakes,&quot; to bolster their election interference efforts, with Russia generating the most content, the NYT reported, citing the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The presidential election will be held on Nov. 5, 2024. Democratic candidate and U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris will face Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump.	https://kyivindependent.com/deepfake-caller-posing-as-ukraines-ex-foreign-minister-talks-to-us-senator/	2024-09-26T12:26:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168226157.jpg
UK to provide Ukraine with 4 additional AS90 self-propelled artillery howitzers	The U.K. Defense Ministry announced on Sept. 26 that it will provide Ukraine with 16 AS90 self-propelled artillery howitzers instead of 12. The announcement comes as President Volodymyr Zelensky continues his visit to the U.S., where he hopes to gain support for his recently announced &quot;victory plan.&quot; The Labor government headed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, formed following the July 4 elections, previously announced its intention to transfer 12 AS90s to Kyiv within the first 100 days of taking office. Ten of these howitzers have been delivered to Ukraine, and in the coming weeks, the Ukrainian Armed Forces will receive six more, the statement read. The British government has also announced the establishment of a new joint British Defense Ministry and Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCDO) unit in Ukraine, headed by Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Defense Secretary John Healey, which will &quot;integrate expertise and help drive a new whole-of-government approach to Ukraine.&quot; The U.K. has consistently voiced strong support for Ukraine and has pledged a total of 12.8 billion pounds (approximately $16.2 billion) in support for the country, which includes 7.8 billion pounds (around $9.9 billion) allocated for military assistance and 5 billion pounds (approximately $6.3 billion) designated for non-military support.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-to-provide-ukraine-with-4-additional-as90-self-propelled-artillery-howitzers/	2024-09-26T11:22:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1564439232.jpg
Ukraine war latest: US announces new military aid package worth almost $8 billion for Ukraine	Key developments on Sept. 26: U.S. President Joe Biden announced a military aid package for Ukraine worth $7.9 billion on Sept. 26. &quot;I am grateful to U.S. President Joseph Biden, the U.S. Congress and both parties, Republican and Democrat, and the entire American people for today&apos;s announcement of significant defense aid to Ukraine totaling $7.9 billion and the imposition of sanctions against Russia,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on social media. Washington authorized a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $375 million the day before, on Sept. 25, amid Zelensky&apos;s ongoing visit to the U.S. Biden said that the Pentagon will allocate the remaining Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) funds by the end of 2024. He authorized $5.5 billion in the presidential drawdown authority (PDA) &quot;to ensure this authority does not expire.&quot; Another $2.4 billion are pledged through the USAI. The new tranche will include an additional Patriot air defense battery, unmanned aerial systems, and air-to-ground munitions, as well as funds to strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industrial base and support its maintenance and sustainment requirements. Washington will also provide Kyiv with the Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) munition &quot;to enhance Ukraine&#x2019;s long-range strike capabilities,&quot; Biden said. The U.S. president also announced the expansion of training for Ukrainian F-16 pilots by supporting the training of an additional 18 next year. &quot;Through these actions, my message is clear: The United States will provide Ukraine with the support it needs to win this war,&quot; Biden said. The German parliament&apos;s lower chamber, the Bundestag, has approved the German government&apos;s proposal to increase funding for military support for Ukraine by nearly 400 million euros ($447 million), according to the Sept. 25 statement. The Bundestag announced the decision to increase financial aid following a meeting under the Ukraine Compact, a security framework signed by 32 allied countries at the NATO summit in July 2024. The meeting was held on Sept. 25 on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. The additional financial assistance will allow the procurement of more air defense systems, tanks, drones, ammunition, and spare parts, &quot;effectively strengthening the Ukrainian Armed Forces in defending their country,&quot; the statement read. Berlin also announced it will provide an additional 170 million euros ($190 million) &quot;soon&quot; to help restore Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure, which comes under frequent Russian attacks. Initially a hesitant partner, Germany has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Berlin will provide Kyiv with around 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion) this year, but the aid will be reportedly cut by half &#x2014; to 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) &#x2014; in 2025. Berlin had been hoping that the shortfall in assistance would be made up by Ukraine receiving $50 billion in profits from frozen Russian assets. However, Hungary has caused delays in the U.S.&apos;s procedural involvement in the assets scheme. &#xA0;In addition to budgetary concerns, German &quot;anti-war&quot; parties that oppose aid to Ukraine on the right and left made gains in regional elections on Sept. 1, causing political complications for Germany&apos;s commitment to support Ukraine.According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW), as of June 2024, Germany has allocated 14.7 billion euros ($16.4 billion) in support for Ukraine since 2022. Ukraine&apos;s 72nd Mechanized Brigade on Sept. 26 refuted reports that it was retreating from the embattled town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast. The brigade released a video purportedly from Vuhledar saying it had been filmed there earlier in the day. &quot;We want to dispel all doubts and the pseudo-experts&apos; thoughts that the 72nd Brigade withdrew from Vuhledar,&quot; a Ukrainian soldier said. &quot;Despite heavy assaults and difficult circumstances, we are still there.&quot; The statement came after a media report suggested Ukrainian soldiers had begun to withdraw from the town, adding Vuhledar was &quot;about to fall.&quot; The 72nd Mechanized Brigade has defended Vuhledar for nearly two years, as Russian forces have been trying to capture the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. The front-line town lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Vuhledar has withstood numerous attacks since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022 and has become key to Ukrainian defenses in the southern part of Donetsk Oblast. The crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState reported that Russian forces are aiming to encircle Vuhledar. Russian troops had not reached the outskirts of town as of Sept. 25, Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin. &quot;Sabotage and reconnaissance groups are coming in, but our defenders are trying to knock them out. This means that the town is not yet captured,&quot; he added. An overnight Russian drone and missile strike targeted three Ukrainian energy transmission facilities, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Sept. 26. &quot;But the Russian terrorists did not achieve their goals &#x2014; Ukraine&apos;s energy system is operating in a balanced mode, no power cuts are planned,&quot; he added in a post on Telegram. Shmyhal said one of the facilities targeted was in Mykolaiv Oblast in southern Ukraine, but did not specify the location of the other two. Ukrainian forces downed 66 out of 78 Shahed-type drones and four Kh-59/69 cruise missiles launched by Russia overnight from, the Air Force reported. Eight more drones were &quot;lost&quot; in a few regions and another one &quot;went back to Russia,&quot; it added. On the morning of Sept. 26, Russian forces also launched three Kinzhal ballistic missiles. Russia launched nine coordinated attacks against Ukraine&apos;s electricity infrastructure between March and August, striking facilities in 20 oblasts, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 25 during his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. &quot;This is how Putin is preparing for winter &#x2014; hoping to torment millions, millions of Ukrainians&#x2026; Ordinary families &#x2014; women, children&#x2026; Ordinary towns, ordinary villages,&quot; Zelensky said. According to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter as a result of the attacks, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand. This summer, the power shortage was 2.5 GW when Kyiv was already experiencing long blackouts. Zelensky told the U.N. Security Council on Sept. 24 that Russia was preparing to target three Ukrainian nuclear power plants. There are three operating nuclear power plants on the Ukrainian-held territory &#x2014; the Rivne and Khmelnytskyi plants in the country&apos;s west, and the Pivdennoukrainsk plant in the south. Russia&apos;s regular attacks put their safety in jeopardy by cutting off power to the units. According to the Energy Ministry, nuclear generation currently accounts for up to 60% of the country&apos;s electricity consumption. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe&apos;s largest nuclear power station, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. Ukraine has 55,000 citizens in its unified register for persons missing under special circumstances, Deputy Interior Minister Leonid Tymchenko told Ukrinform in an interview published on Sept. 26. The register includes people who have disappeared due to war, occupation, or natural and man-made disasters. The figure underscores the humanitarian impact of Russia&apos;s full-scale war, which has brought illegal deportations, kidnappings, and a large number of deaths among both the military and civilians in Ukraine. &quot;The register contains information about 55,000 people. Most of them are military personnel. This figure is quite dynamic: when the whereabouts of missing persons are established, in some cases, it turns out that a citizen, for example, is in captivity,&quot; Tymchenko said. &quot;Unfortunately, we also identify the dead among those who were considered missing,&quot; he added. The latest figure shows a considerable growth since July, when the Interior Ministry revealed that 42,000 Ukrainians were considered missing. This number does not include Ukrainian children forcibly deported to Russia, Belarus, or occupied territories, whose numbers exceed 19,500.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-us-announces-new-military-aid-package-worth-almost-8-billion-for-ukraine/	2024-09-26T10:39:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174502892.jpg
UK introduces sanctions against ships, companies involved in export of Russian LNG	The U.K. imposed sanctions on Sept. 25 against five vessels and two companies involved in the transportation of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) as it looks to exert more pressure on sources of revenue for the Kremlin, according to a statement. While LNG exports have been less heavily sanctioned than oil, recent restrictions have begun tightening the noose around this sector as well. &quot;LNG is an important source of funding for (Vladimir) Putin&apos;s illegal war in Ukraine. Russia has plans to expand its LNG revenues, aiming to grow its global LNG market share from 8% to 20%,&quot; the statement read. The vessels Pioneer, Asya Energy, Nova Energy, North Sky, and SCF La Perouse were sanctioned in this latest move. London also imposed restrictions on two entities, including Ocean Speedstar Solutions OPC, the operator of the Pioneer and Asya Energy vessels, as well as on White Fox Ship Management, the operator and manager of the North Sky vessel. Under British sanctions legislation, listed ships are prohibited from accessing U.K. ports and may face other restrictions, including arrest and denial of registration. The U.K. has now sanctioned 15 vessels and entities involved in the Russian LNG sector, according to the statement. Earlier this year, the U.K., along with its allies, the U.S. and European Union, sanctioned Arctic LNG 2. Arctic LNG 2, owned by Russia&apos;s Novatek company, aims to produce almost 20 million metric tons of LNG per year to sell primarily to Asian markets, potentially generating billions of dollars in revenue. It was envisaged as Russia&apos;s largest LNG plant and a flagship project to help the country become the world&apos;s leading LNG producer.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-introduces-sanctions-against-ships-organizations-involved-in-export-of-russian-lng/	2024-09-26T09:59:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1259161176.jpg

US-sanctioned ex-Ukrainian official wins defamation lawsuit against media, including Kyiv Independent	The Shevchenkivskyi District Court in Kyiv on Sept. 23 ruled in favor of Andriy Portnov, a former top official in ex-President Viktor Yanukovych&#x2019;s administration, in a defamation case against several news outlets, including the Kyiv Independent. Portnov challenged a reference to him as a &#x201C;pro-Russian&#x201D; politician and a person &#x201C;infamous for his open support for Russia.&#x201D; The lawsuit concerns a story by Glib Kanievskyi, then a Ukrainian journalist and currently a defense ministry official, published in several news outlets, including the Kyiv Independent, in September 2023. The story was an investigative report pointing out that Ukrainian officials impose sanctions on petty pro-Russian politicians, but ignore the most high-profile ones. Portnov was listed as one of the examples: He is under sanctions in the U.S., but not in Ukraine. In response to the story, Portnov sued the author of the report and the news outlets that ran it, including Statewatch, LB.ua, and Kyiv Independent as represented by Chief Editor Olga Rudenko. Portnov, a lawyer, is known as one of the most litigious Ukrainian ex-officials. In 2021, Portnov was added to the U.S. sanctions list over allegations that he was involved in corruption in Ukraine, particularly in the judiciary. In the commentary that ran with the sanctions inclusions, the U.S. treasury wrote that Portnov &#x201C;cultivated extensive connections to Ukraine&#x2019;s judicial and law enforcement apparatus through bribery.&#x201D; &#x201C;Widely known as a court fixer, Portnov was credibly accused of using his influence to buy access and decisions in Ukraine&#x2019;s courts and undermining reform efforts,&#x201D; reads the U.S. Treasury website. &#x201C;As of 2019, Portnov took steps to control the Ukrainian judiciary, influence associated legislation, sought to place loyal officials in senior judiciary positions, and purchase court decisions. In mid-2019, Portnov colluded with a high ranking Ukrainian government official to shape the country&#x2019;s higher legal institutions to their advantage and influence Ukraine&#x2019;s Constitutional Court. Additionally, Portnov has been involved in an attempt to influence the Ukrainian Prosecutor General.&#x201D; In 2010-2014, Portnov served in the administration of then-President Yanukovych. In February 2014, Yanukovych and his administration were ousted by the protests known as the EuroMaidan Revolution. Over the course of the next few years, Ukrainian authorities looked into Portnov&#x2019;s activities as part of a number of criminal investigations, including one that concerned high treason and alleged that Portnov had a role in the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014. The case was closed in 2019. According to media reports, Portnov doesn&#x2019;t currently reside in Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Chief Editor Olga Rudenko and other defendants will appeal the ruling. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a sad irony that an ex-official sanctioned over allegations of holding undue influence over Ukrainian courts wins a case against journalists &#x2014; in a Ukrainian court,&#x201D; said Rudenko. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s alarming because it&#x2019;s symptomatic of the endemic problems in the Ukrainian judiciary. We are going to fight this ruling until the highest possible judicial instance.&#x201D; The lawyers who defended the journalists in the case said that there were obvious violations in the ruling. &#x201C;The court pronounced value judgment &#x2018;false information&#x2019; while a value judgment can&#x2019;t be disproved,&#x201D; said Oksana Maksymeniuk, head of the legal department of the Regional Press Development Institute, whose lawyers represent the media sued by Portnov. &#x201C;This ruling was certainly carried out with violations, and it will be appealed.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-sanctioned-ex-ukrainian-official-wins-defamation-lawsuit-against-media-including-kyiv-independent/	2024-09-26T08:11:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-26-at-18_08_32-1.png
Ukraine considers 55,000 citizens as missing persons	Ukraine has 55,000 citizens in its unified register for persons missing under special circumstances, Deputy Interior Minister Leonid Tymchenko told Ukrinform in an interview published on Sept. 26. The register includes people who have disappeared due to war, occupation, or natural and man-made disasters. The figure underscores the humanitarian impact of Russia&apos;s full-scale war, which has brought illegal deportations, kidnappings, and a large number of deaths among both the military and civilians in Ukraine. &quot;The register contains information about 55,000 people. Most of them are military personnel. This figure is quite dynamic: when the whereabouts of missing persons are established, in some cases, it turns out that a citizen, for example, is in captivity,&quot; Tymchenko said. &quot;Unfortunately, we also identify the dead among those who were considered missing,&quot; he added. The latest figure shows a considerable growth since July, when the Interior Ministry revealed that 42,000 Ukrainians were considered missing. This number does not include Ukrainian children forcibly deported to Russia, Belarus, or occupied territories, whose numbers exceed 19,500.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-considers-55-000-citizens-as-missing-persons/	2024-09-26T07:24:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156892680.jpg
New Skynex video shows Ukraine's cutting-edge drone destroyer in action	Ukraine&apos;s Air Force has released footage showing one of its most advanced weapons in action &#x2013; the German-supplied Skynex system. Filmed in an unidentified location, the video released on Sept. 25 via social media shows the air defense system engaging and destroying targets over the skies of Ukraine. &#x201C;Practical strikes have been conducted using the Skynex air defense system against various types of aerial targets &#x2026; all are operating smoothly &#x2013; Glory to Ukraine,&#x201D; an unidentified Ukrainian soldier is seen saying in the video as other troops operate the technologically advanced system in the background. Skynex Air Defence System of the Ukrainian Air Force &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1E6; pic.twitter.com/hhJzDXc9vs According to its German manufacturer Rheinmetall, Skynex is a &quot;networked air defense&quot; that provides &quot;a highly effective layered protection shield against a wide spectrum of air threats&quot; and serves as &quot;the necessary answer against saturation and swarm attacks in the future.&quot; In short, it&apos;s a big, powerful, and highly accurate mobile gun that is very effective at shooting down drones. Big-ticket air defense systems provided to Ukraine by Western allies like NASAMs, IRIS-T and Patriots are costly surface-to-air missiles. Hence, they are set aside to intercept Russian missiles. Air defense systems firing multiple rounds of high-caliber bullets using sophisticated computer targeting and mechanical systems like the Skynex, in contrast, are used to protect Ukraine&#x2019;s skies by intercepting drones. The Iranian-made Shahed drones deployed by Russia&#x2019;s invading forces daily for strikes across Ukraine are cheap. Export versions cost around $193,000, and those made by Russia domestically cost only about $10,000-$50,000. One NASAM missile costs from $600,000 to $1 million. A Patriot missile is nearly $4 million. A relatively cheap IRIS-T missile is still around $450,000. Russia launches Shahed-type drones against Ukraine on an almost nightly basis. In the early hours of Sept. 26, it was reported that 78 were used in overnight attacks across the country, so using air defense missiles to shoot them down is not a financially viable option in the long term. &quot;One of the key features of the war is the use of relatively low-cost delivery systems such as drones,&quot; Martin J. Dougherty, weapons expert and author of &quot;Aircraft, Tanks and Artillery of the Ukraine War,&quot; told the Kyiv Independent earlier this year. &quot;Defense against such weapons requires a low cost per engagement and the ability to eliminate multiple threats in a short time. &quot;The difficulty of detecting, tracking, and hitting such small targets is also considerable,&quot; Dougherty added. Ukraine has relied on systems like the German-made Gepard and the more basic and not always effective tactic of shooting them down with large 50-caliber machine guns mounted on trucks. Close one. Ukrainian mobile air defense units in Kharkiv oblast trying to repel a Shahed drone attack. The drone hits the ground just tens of meters away. pic.twitter.com/8xuHNPwO7t Skynex is a middle ground between the two &#x2013; a highly accurate system that can down drones more efficiently. Skynex is a modular system, meaning it can be configured in a variety of ways depending on the threat. Details of those systems sent to Ukraine have not been made public, but a version featured in a Rheinmetall promotional video from 2022 would seem likely to be a candidate. In it, an Oerlikon Revolver Gun Mk3 &#x2013; used in the Skynex system and capable of firing at a rate of 1,000 rounds per minute with a range of 4,000 meters &#x2013; mounted on a truck takes out a swarm of small FPV (first-person-view) drones in a single burst of fire. According to Rheinmetall&apos;s rather vague description, Skynex uses a variety of &quot;sensors and effectors,&quot; as well as &quot;one or several medium-range radars&quot; to detect and identify the drones, all coordinated through the Oerlikon Skymaster Battle Management System. But it&apos;s the ammunition that is key. Skynex fires 35mm Oerlikon Ahead rounds. Instead of directly striking the target, they explode just before they reach it, releasing a cluster of tungsten sub-projectiles which increases the chances of successfully destroying the drone. (Please add the credit)Crucially, it&apos;s also relatively cheap. Taking out a target costs just over $4,000, significantly less than even the lowest price estimate of a Shahed. According to the manufacturer, it can also, in theory, take down cruise missiles, though it&apos;s not currently known if it has done so. &quot;Skynex was developed to counter small, low-cost threats such as mortar rounds. This capability has transferred well to the emerging drone threat and may be essential to a layered air defense system,&quot; Dougherty said. As far as has been reported, Ukraine only possesses two Skynex systems, far too few to have a decisive impact on the war. While their locations are not public, given their effectiveness, it can be safely assumed they&apos;re protecting at least two very important targets &#x2014; possibly even their longer-range and more powerful big brothers. &quot;High-value missile systems, capable of engaging enemy aircraft at long range, may be vulnerable to attack by small, hard-to-track loitering munitions,&quot; Dougherty said. &quot;It may be that short-range air defense systems such as Skynex will be necessary to keep the big hitters in the game.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/new-skynex-video-shows-ukraines-cutting-edge-drone-destroyer-in-action/	2024-09-26T07:14:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/upd_Skynex.jpg
Biden to convene Ramstein leader-level meeting in October	U.S. President Joe Biden will convene a leader-level meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Germany in October &quot;to coordinate the efforts of the more than 50 countries supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression,&quot; he announced on Sept. 26. The announcement comes as President Volodymyr Zelensky continues his visit to the U.S., where he hopes to get support for his recently-announced &quot;victory plan.&quot; The Ukraine Defense Contact Group is the U.S.-led group consisting of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The last Ramstein meeting on Sept. 6 was the group&apos;s 24th gathering since its establishment in April 2022. During the meeting, which Zelensky attended in person, Ukraine received pledges of new military aid from allies, including the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Canada. Kyiv has been promised at least one air defense system, along with missiles, tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, and other munitions. The much-coveted long-range weapons like additional ATACMS or Storm Shadow were not on the list, nor were changes to restrictions on their use. Ukraine is hoping for permission to use two Western-supplied long-range missiles that it already possesses to strike military targets such as airfields located deep inside Russian territory. According to reports, the U.K. has already decided to grant Ukraine permission to use Storm Shadows to strike targets deep inside Russia but wants the backing of the U.S. and other countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-to-convene-ramstein-leader-level-meeting-in-october/	2024-09-26T07:05:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161024572-1.jpg
What we know about the ‘victory plan’ Zelensky is presenting to Biden today	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to present the victory plan to his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden at the White House on Sept. 26, a potentially pivotal moment in the long-running saga of Washington&apos;s support for Ukraine. Zelensky, who is visiting the U.S. this week, has said that the plan is designed to push Russian President Vladimir Putin into a fair peace agreement by boosting Ukraine&#x2019;s firepower and giving it an upper hand two and a half years into Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Zelensky has not publicly specified how it will achieve this. Here&apos;s what we know so far&#x2026; The announcement that Kyiv was preparing a victory plan came as Ukraine gained momentum following its surprise incursion into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. The ongoing operation, the first significant invasion of Russian territory since World War II, was a significant blow to the Kremlin and Putin. It exposed Russia&#x2019;s inability to defend its own territory and challenged Putin&#x2019;s so-called &quot;red lines&quot; aimed at deterring Ukraine&#x2019;s Western allies from stepping up weaponry supplies. It also showed Ukraine&apos;s backers that Kyiv could still seize the initiative on the battlefield. As well as riding the momentum of the Kursk operation, events in the U.S. could also be a big factor in Kyiv&apos;s push to present the plan &#x2014; the November U.S. presidential election that might bring former President Donald Trump back to the White House and jeopardize the U.S. support for Ukraine. The fine details of the plan are yet to be made public. It is expected to address military, political, diplomatic, and economic strategies. A source close to Zelensky told the Kyiv Independent last week that it aims &quot;to create such conditions and such an atmosphere that Russia will no longer be able to ignore the peace formula and the peace summit.&quot; But some elements have been revealed. The head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak earlier this week said that an invitation to join NATO is part of the plan. According to the information obtained by the Kyiv Independent on Sept. 22, Ukraine would ask for NATO membership within the months, not years. Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Yermak also said that the five-point victory plan includes both diplomatic and military components.

(Andrew Caballero-Reynolds / AFP via Getty Images)&quot;I also urged our partners to ignore Russia&apos;s threats of escalation,&quot; he said. One element certain to be in the plan is the U.S. and other allies&apos; approval for Ukraine to use long-range weapons including Western-provided missiles to target military sites deep inside Russia. Kyiv has long been pushing for restrictions to be lifted as it would enable Ukraine to destroy the airfields from which Russian aircraft are taking off to attack Ukrainian civilian infrastructure as well as degrade Russian air defenses. And we also know one thing that won&apos;t be in the plan &#x2013; a partial ceasefire. After a German media report suggested otherwise, Zelensky personally refuted the claim. &quot;There is not and cannot be any alternative to peace, no freezing of the war or any other manipulations that will simply move Russian aggression to another stage,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address on Sept. 18. The first reports aren&apos;t too positive. The White House is concerned that Zelensky&apos;s plan lacks a clear strategy to win against Russia, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Sept. 25, citing U.S. and European officials. Some officials familiar with the plan&apos;s outlines said it focuses too heavily on requesting more weapons and lifting restrictions on long-range missile strikes. &quot;I&apos;m unimpressed, there&apos;s not much new there,&quot; one senior official told the WSJ. White House officials are worried that Zelensky&apos;s plan does not offer clear, actionable steps that Biden can support in his four remaining months in office, the WSJ reported. U.S. and European officials told the WSJ that parts of the plan remain underdeveloped, and that requests related to weapons are the most specific and detailed. &quot;That&apos;s a horrible thought,&quot; Zelensky said when asked this question by The New Yorker in an interview, published on Sept. 22. &quot;It would mean that Biden doesn&apos;t want to end the war in any way that denies Russia a victory,&quot; he said. &quot;And we would end up with a very long war&#x2014;an impossible, exhausting situation that would kill a tremendous number of people. Having said that, I can&apos;t blame Biden for anything,&quot; Zelensky added.	https://kyivindependent.com/what-we-know-about-the-victory-plan-zelensky-is-presenting-to-biden-today/	2024-09-26T06:39:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173579421.jpg
3 energy infrastructure facilities struck in overnight Russian strikes, Ukrainian PM says	An overnight Russian drone and missile strike targeted three Ukrainian energy transmission facilities, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Sept. 26. &quot;But the Russian terrorists did not achieve their goals &#x2014; Ukraine&apos;s energy system is operating in a balanced mode, no power cuts are planned,&quot; he added in a post on Telegram. Shmyhal said one of the facilities targeted was in Mykolaiv Oblast in southern Ukraine, but did not specify the location of the other two. Ukrainian forces downed 66 out of 78 Shahed-type drones and four Kh-59/69 cruise missiles launched by Russia overnight from, the Air Force reported. Eight more drones were &quot;lost&quot; in a few regions and another one &quot;went back to Russia,&quot; it added. On the morning of Sept. 26, Russian forces also launched three Kinzhal ballistic missiles. Russia launched nine coordinated attacks against Ukraine&apos;s electricity infrastructure between March and August, striking facilities in 20 oblasts, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 25 during his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. &quot;This is how Putin is preparing for winter &#x2014; hoping to torment millions, millions of Ukrainians&#x2026; Ordinary families &#x2014; women, children&#x2026; Ordinary towns, ordinary villages,&quot; Zelensky said. According to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter as a result of the attacks, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand. This summer, the power shortage was 2.5 GW when Kyiv was already experiencing long blackouts. Zelensky told the U.N. Security Council on Sept. 24 that Russia was preparing to target three Ukrainian nuclear power plants. There are three operating nuclear power plants on the Ukrainian-held territory &#x2014; the Rivne and Khmelnytskyi plants in the country&apos;s west, and the Pivdennoukrainsk plant in the south. Russia&apos;s regular attacks put their safety in jeopardy by cutting off power to the units. According to the Energy Ministry, nuclear generation currently accounts for up to 60% of the country&apos;s electricity consumption. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe&apos;s largest nuclear power station, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/3-energy-infrastructure-facilities-struck-in-overnight-russian-strikes-ukrainian-pm-says/	2024-09-26T06:26:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2024-09-26-16_12_08.jpeg
Ukraine's 72nd Brigade releases video from Vuhledar, denies claims about withdrawal	Ukraine&apos;s 72nd Mechanized Brigade on Sept. 26 refuted reports that it was retreating from the embattled town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast. The brigade released a video purportedly from Vuhledar saying it had been filmed there earlier in the day. &quot;We want to dispel all doubts and the pseudo-experts&apos; thoughts that the 72nd Brigade withdrew from Vuhledar,&quot; a Ukrainian soldier said. &quot;Despite heavy assaults and difficult circumstances, we are still there.&quot; The statement came after a media report suggested Ukrainian soldiers had begun to withdraw from the town, adding Vuhledar was &quot;about to fall.&quot; The 72nd Mechanized Brigade has defended Vuhledar for nearly two years, as Russian forces have been trying to capture the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. 0:00/1&#xD7;Ukraine&apos;s 72nd Mechanized Brigade on Sept. 26 refuted reports that it was retreating from the embattled town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast. (Ukraine&apos;s 72nd Mechanized Brigade)The front-line town lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Vuhledar has withstood numerous attacks since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022 and has become key to Ukrainian defenses in the southern part of Donetsk Oblast. The crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState reported that Russian forces are aiming to encircle Vuhledar. Russian troops had not reached the outskirts of town as of Sept. 25, Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin. &quot;Sabotage and reconnaissance groups are coming in, but our defenders are trying to knock them out. This means that the town is not yet captured,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-72nd-brigade-releases-video-from-vuhledar-denies-claims-about-withdrawal/	2024-09-26T04:40:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1858325594-2.jpg
Ukraine state-owned enterprises weekly — Issue 148	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This is issue 148 of Ukrainian State-Owned Enterprises Weekly, covering events from September 15-21, 2024. The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission. UDI looking for a new CEO. On Sept. 19, Ukrainian Defense Industry (UDI) said that its supervisory board had launched a competitive selection for the CEO position. Candidates can apply from Sept. 20 to Oct. 4. The search and screening of applicants is done by the Ukrainian office of Odgers Berndtson, an international executive search firm, UDI added. As we wrote earlier, UDI&#x2019;s CEO Herman Smetanin resigned on Sept. 4 to become the new strategic industries minister the next day, replacing Oleksandr Kamyshin. UDI&#x2019;s supervisory board then appointed Oleh Huliak as an acting CEO and said that it would announce a competitive selection for the new CEO as soon as possible. See Issue 146 for more detail. Ukrzaliznytsia gets a new supervisory board member. On Sept. 13, the Cabinet of Ministers appointed Oleksandr Kamyshin as a state representative on Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s supervisory board, starting on Sept. 26. Kamyshin will replace Serhiy Moskalenko, Forbes Ukraine&#x2019;s source added. (See our Issue 60 for more information on the composition of Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s supervisory board.) As we reported in Issue 39 three years ago, then acting CEO of Ukrzaliznytsia, Ivan Yuryk, filed his resignation in August 2021. After that, the Cabinet of Ministers appointed Kamyshin as acting CEO. In Issue 49, we reported that in October 2021, Kamyshin was re-appointed as CEO until Dec. 31, 2021. On March 24, 2022, Kamyshin reported that based on the supervisory board&#x2019;s proposal, the Cabinet appointed the executive board of Ukrzaliznytsia on a permanent basis. Kamyshin was approved for four years, and the other executives, for three years. As we wrote one and half years ago, the Cabinet dismissed Kamyshin on March 21, 2023, and appointed Yevhen Lyashchenko as Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s new CEO for the next two years. On the same day, the Verkhovna Rada appointed Kamyshin as the new strategic industries minister. See Issue 80 for more detail. As we reported two weeks ago, UDI&#x2019;s CEO Herman Smetanin left the company to become the new strategic industries minister. He replaced Kamyshin, who later moved to the position of president&#x2019;s advisor for strategic issues. See Issue 146 for more detail. Ukrenergo to get a new supervisory board. On Sept. 20, the Energy Ministry (in its capacity as Ukrenergo&#x2019;s general shareholders meeting) announced a competitive selection for three independent members of the company&#x2019;s supervisory board. As we wrote in Issue 146, on Sept. 2, Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board dismissed the company&#x2019;s CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi by a majority vote. The board appointed executive board member Oleksii Brekht as acting CEO and decided to hold a competitive selection for a new CEO. On the same day, Daniel Dobbeni (independent member and supervisory board chair) and Peder Andreasen (independent member) announced that they filed their resignation notices. &#x201C;We strongly believe that the decision on the early dismissal of the CEO of Ukrenergo is politically motivated and, based on the results of the presented report, there are no valid grounds for it,&#x201D; they said in a statement. On Sept. 6, Bridget Brink, U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said that Ukraine should complete Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board after independent members resigned in protest against Kudrytskyi&#x2019;s dismissal. See Issue 146 for more detail. On Sept. 10, Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reached a staff-level agreement on the fifth review of the four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Arrangement. Subject to approval by the IMF Executive Board, Ukraine would have access to about $1.1 billion. According to IMF&#x2019;s release, the full supervisory board of Ukrenergo should be re-established by end-December 2024. The terms of office of the current members of Ukrenergo&#x2019;s board expire in late 2024 &#x2014; early 2025, the ministry added. Along with the competitive selection of independent members, the ministry would also identify and select candidate state representatives. According to Ukrenergo&#x2019;s charter, its supervisory board should consist of seven members: four independent members and three state representatives. As we reported in June 2023, the Cabinet still had to select and approve one independent member for Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board. Hence, independent members did not constitute a majority of the board, which did not meet the requirements of the law or Ukrenergo&#x2019;s charter. See our Issue 95 for more detail. The selection of all board members &#x2014; four independent and three state representatives &#x2014; is scheduled to be completed by Dec. 9. The first and foremost task of the new supervisory board would be to conduct a transparent competitive selection of Ukrenergo&#x2019;s CEO, the ministry also said. Naftogaz Group pays Hr 60 billion ($1.5billion) in taxes for January-August 2024, the company&#x2019;s press office said on 1Sept. 16. This includes Hr 56.5 billion ($1.37 billion) paid to the state budget and Hr 4.3 billion ($104 million) paid to local government budgets. In August alone, Naftogaz Group paid Hr 7.2 billion ($174 million) in state taxes and about Hr 600 million ($14.5 million) in local ones. As we reported earlier, Naftogaz Group paid Hr 6.1 billion ($147.9 million) in taxes to state and local budgets for January 2024 (see Issue 119), Hr 5.3 billion ($128 million) for February (see Issue 123), Hr 8.3 billion ($201 million) for March (see Issue 128), Hr 8 billion ($193 million) for April (see Issue 132), Hr 9.3 billion ($225 million) for May (see Issue 137), Hr 9.2 billion ($223 million) for June (see Issue 140), and Hr 6 billion ($145 million) for July (see Issue 143). As we wrote in Issue 115, Naftogaz Group paid Hr 83.4 billion ($2 billion) in taxes to the state budget and another Hr 6.8 billion ($164 million) to local government budgets in 2023. The Group said that it made Hr 23.1 billion ($560 million) in consolidated net profit in 2023, a significant rebound from its Hr 79.1 billion ($1.9 billion) loss in 2022. See our Issue 131 for detail. Hotel Ukraina sold. On Sept. 18, the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) sold Kyiv&#x2019;s four-star Ukraine Hotel for Hr 2.5 billion ($60 million), a more than twofold increase from the starting price of Hr 1.05 billion ($25 million). According to Prozorro.Sale, the winner is Ola Fine LLC, owned by businessman Maksym Krippa. Notably, Ola Fine&#x2019;s bid was almost double of the second bid, Hr 1.5 billion (around $36 million), and more than double of the third bid, Hr 1.2 billion (ca. $29 million). The sale of the Ukraine Hotel was the country&#x2019;s first online auction for a large-scale privatization asset in the Prozorro.Sale system, the SPFU said. As we wrote in Issue 114, the 2024 state budget projects the privatization revenue at Hr 4 billion (around $96 million). According to a recent SPFU report, privatization generated Hr 2 billion ($48 million) in January-August 2024. All these proceeds were from small-scale privatization. In other words, the winning bid on Hotel Ukraina alone is larger than all the small-scale privatization revenues since the beginning of this year. If Ola Fine pays up as required by the regulations, the SPFU&#x2019;s privatization revenue plan for 2024, however modest, will be completed for the first time in many years. According to the SPFU, the auction winner has 30 working days to pay the lot price. Only after the funds are transferred to the state budget can the sale and purchase agreement be signed. Maksym Krippa, a businessman that shies publicity, became famous in 2022 when Forbes Ukraine wrote that he had acquired the main Ukrainian esports brand, the NAVI team. Later, the businessman&#x2019;s representatives confirmed that the deal was concluded back in 2018. Krippa also owns Maincast esports broadcasting studio. In 2023, he acquired GSC Game World, a company that developed the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. cyber game. According to Ekonomichna Pravda (EP), also in 2023, a new media group was formed in Ukraine: the online outlet Glavkom was taken over by Tatiana Snopko. Six months earlier, Snopko had acquired the Ekonomika+ media holding, which includes Delo.ua, Top-100, Wo.mo, and Marketing Media Review. According to EP&#x2019;s sources in the media market, Krippa was behind the acquisition of the news sites, while Snopko was just a nominal owner. According to liga.net, Krippa, who acquired the Brovary Wholesale Market back in 2009, has recently started buying up significant real estate objects in Kyiv. In 2020, he purchased the Dnipro Hotel in Kyiv, which is located near the Ukraine Hotel, and at the end of 2023, the Parus Business Center, previously owned by businessman and former lawmaker Vadym Stolar. In an interview for Forbes Ukraine last week, Krippa claimed that he received funds for these assets from diversified sources: income from successfully implemented business projects, real estate, dividends, and investment assets. Earlier, Forbes Ukraine linked him to the Vulcan Online Casino, GGBet bookmakers, and Evoplay IT company, but Krippa denied this. In his interview for Forbes Ukraine last week, Krippa said that Ukraine Hotel is not just a hotel, but a historic building in central Kyiv with significant capitalization potential. He plans to effectively develop the hotel and renovate it after the full-scale war, but he refused to disclose the plan. As we wrote in Issue 116, the SPFU planned to put Kyiv&#x2019;s four-star Hotel Ukraina up for privatization. According to SPFU then-head Vitaliy Koval, the hotel is under-booked because of martial law and has racked up more than Hr 45 million in debt (around $1.1 million at the time). The Cabinet of Ministers designated Hotel Ukraina as a large-scale asset for privatization on April 23 (see our Issue 129). On July 12, the Cabinet approved the terms of sale of the hotel. The starting price was set at Hr 1.05 billion ($25 million). See Issue 140 for more detail. As we wrote in Issue 141, the SPFU then scheduled the auction for the Hotel Ukraina for Sept. 18. The tenth and eleventh attempts to sell Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi port fail. According to Prozorro.Sale, an auction for the sale of the Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi trade seaport, scheduled by the SPFU for Sept. 16, failed due to the absence of bidders. The starting price was Hr 89 million ($2.1 million). This was the tenth attempt to sell the port. The SPFU then extended the deadline for bidders to Sept. 24 with the same starting price, but the eleventh auction also failed for the same reason. Prior to that auction, the SPFU told delo.ua that if no bidders come forward, the starting price would have to be reduced further. Earlier, liga.net wrote that SME Nika-Tera LLC (part of Dmytro Firtash&#x2019;s Group DF), Potoky Oil Extraction Plant (part of Vadym Yermolayev&#x2019;s Alef Corporation), and grain trading and shipbuilding Nibulon (owned by Andriy Vadatursky) were interested in privatizing the port. The payback period of the port is too long to invest in it in the current realities, Oleg Arestarkhov, Head of Corporate Communications at Group DF, told liga.net. As we wrote in Issue 147, according to CASE Ukraine, despite the attractiveness of the asset, there are no bidders because the port has debts of Hr 151.3 million ($3.6 million). The winner would also have to pay VAT of 20% of the purchase price. This suggests that, based on CASE Ukraine&#x2019;s information, the winning bidder would have to pay at least Hr 258 million ($6.2 million) in total. Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi also faces a significant logistical constraint: the drawbridge to the port was destroyed by Russian shelling. Without its restoration, the port would not be able to operate properly, Arestarkhov added. &#x201C;Near Mykolaiv, we have the Nika-Tera port, which was destroyed by Russian attacks. Our post-war priorities are to restore our port. We will restore our port, and only then will we look at other assets,&#x201D; he summarized. Later, Nibulon told delo.ua that it was no longer considering the acquisition of the asset, without specifying the reasons for the refusal. Alef Corporation did not comment on its plans to privatize the port, the media added. The first privatization auction for Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi in March 2023 failed as no one registered. At the second auction, the seaport was sold for Hr 220 million (around $5 million at the time) to Ukrdoninvest LLC, a company owned by Ukrainian businessman Vitaliy Kropachov. However, Ukrdoninvest did not pay up. As we reported in April 2023 (Issue 85), the company said that it backed out while hashing out the terms of the purchase agreement with SPFU&#x2019;s regional office in Odesa and Mykolaiv oblasts. In June 2023, SPFU announced that it would put Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi up for privatization for a third time, another attempt that failed. (See Issue 93.)&#x202F;In Issues 99 and 100, we reported about the following failed attempts to sell the port. As we wrote in August 2024 (Issue 144), former Deputy Minister of Infrastructure Viktor Dovhan posted on Facebook suggesting that Polish investors were considering participating in the privatization of the port. However, as we reported in Issue 147, the ninth attempt to sell the port also failed. For more detail, see SOE Weekly&#x2019;s Issues 74, 78, 79, 84, 85, 87, 93, 99, 100, 144, and &#xA0;147 for more detail.

US pledges nearly $8 billion in military aid for Ukraine, Zelensky says	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. The U.S. announced a military aid package for Ukraine worth $7.9 billion, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 26. &quot;I am grateful to U.S. President Joseph Biden, the U.S. Congress and both parties, Republican and Democrat, and the entire American people for today&apos;s announcement of significant defense aid to Ukraine totaling $7.9 billion and the imposition of sanctions against Russia,&quot; he said in a post on social media.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-pledges-nearly-8-billion-military-aid-package-for-ukraine-zelensky-says/	2024-09-26T03:13:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2161013738.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill at least 8, injure 44 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed eight people and injured at least 44 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Sept. 26. Ukrainian forces downed 66 out of 78 Shahed-type drones and four Kh-59/69 cruise missiles launched by Russia overnight from, the Air Force reported. Eight more drones were &quot;lost&quot; in a few regions and another one &quot;went back to Russia,&quot; it added. More than 15 drones were spotted near Kyiv, with around 10 of them downed by air defenses, local authorities said. The rest of the drones were destroyed over 14 of Ukraine&apos;s oblasts, the Air Force reported. Russian forces also attacked Odesa Oblast with four missiles overnight, killing a 62-year-old woman, Governor Oleh Kiper said. Two more missiles were fired at Sumy Oblast. The drone attack also damaged a critical infrastructure facility in the city of Ivano-Frankivsk in Ukraine&apos;s west, causing a partial power outage, according to local authorities. Another Russian drone flew near the industrial site of the Rivne nuclear power plant at &quot;a critically low altitude,&quot; state nuclear energy agency Energoatom said. A Russian overnight air strike on the city of Zaporizhzhia injured at least 10 people, including a 14-year-old boy, according to Governor Ivan Fedorov. The attack destroyed and damaged 12 houses. Two people were killed and 19 injured in the city of Kramatorsk in Donetsk Oblast as a result of a Russian Sept. 25 attack, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Two more people were killed in the settlements of Hirnyk and Dronivka. A civilian was killed in a Russian guided aerial bomb attack on the Yunakivka community in Sumy Oblast, local authorities reported. A Russian attack on the village of Ivashky in Kharkiv Oblast on the morning of Sept. 26 injured a person, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 24 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Two people were killed and 14 were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-at-least-8-injure-44-over-past-day/	2024-09-26T02:52:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2024-09-26_07-37-32.jpg
3 Red Cross representatives injured in Russian attack on Kramatorsk	A Russian attack on the city of Kramatorsk, Donetsk Oblast, on Sept. 25 injured three representatives of the Ukrainian Red Cross Society while on a humanitarian mission, the organization said. Russia targeted the city center with two guided aerial bombs, damaging two high-rise buildings, shops, and cars. At least two people were killed and 19 injured, including children, local authorities reported. One Red Cross volunteer was injured and hospitalized. The head of the Kramatorsk city organization of the Ukrainian Red Cross and the driver who were in the car also suffered injuries, the organization said. &quot;The Ukrainian Red Cross continues its mission to provide assistance to the civilian population despite the danger posed by the ongoing war in the country,&quot; the statement read. In mid-September, Russian forces attacked the village of Viroliubivka near Kostiantynivka in Donetsk Oblast, killing three employees of the International Committee of the Red Cross mission and injuring two others. Kramatorsk comes under regular Russian attacks. The strike on the Safir (Sapphire) Hotel in on Aug. 24 killed British national Ryan Evans, a security adviser for Reuters, and seriously injured Reuters camera operator Ivan Lubysh-Kirdey.	https://kyivindependent.com/3-red-cross-employees-injured-in-russian-attack-on-kramatorsk/	2024-09-26T02:05:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/460963925_942627737909097_8200267715590976812_n.jpg
Explosions heard in Kyiv as Russia reportedly launches Kinzhal missiles	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. Explosions were heard in Kyiv on the morning of Sept. 26 almost immediately after an air raid alert went off in the city, Kyiv Independent correspondents reported. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force said that Russia had used a Mig-31K aircraft, a carrier of Kinzhal ballistic missiles that Russia uses to attack Ukraine. At least two missiles were launched, according to the statement. No damage or casualties have been reported at this time. Explosions were also reported in the town of Starokostinatyniv in western Khmelnytskyi Oblast, which is the home of a Ukrainian air base. Overnight, more than 15 drones were spotted near Kyiv, with around 10 of them downed by air defenses, the Kyiv City Military Administration said. No casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/explosions-reported-in-kyiv-amid/	2024-09-26T00:33:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2163411657.jpg
Over 30 nations, EU adopt declaration in support of Ukraine's recovery	More than 30 countries and the European Union adopted the Joint Declaration of Support for Recovery and Reconstruction of Ukraine during a meeting in New York on Sept. 25, Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office said. Backed during the Group of Seven (G7) + Ukraine meeting, the document contains several points including helping to rebuild Ukraine on its path to EU accession, and providing about $50 billion by the end of 2024 in profits from frozen Russian assets. &quot;I&apos;m determined to ensure that Ukraine has what it needs to prevail in its fight for survival. Tomorrow, I will announce a series of actions to accelerate support for Ukraine&apos;s military,&quot; U.S. President Joe Biden said. The U.S. authorized a new military aid package for Kyiv worth $375 million on Sept. 25. Washington is also reportedly planning a military aid package worth over $8 billion, which is expected to be announced when President Volodymyr Zelensky visits the White House on Sept. 26. The countries said that by collectively supporting Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction they will ensure that Russia is unable to achieve its goals, as well as contribute to the post-war stability of Ukraine&apos;s economy, according to the Presidential Office. Zelensky said that the effort will be coordinated through the Ukrainian Donor Platform. &quot;It is absolutely justified that those who help us withstand now will be the first to benefit together with Ukraine from the large-scale reconstruction,&quot; he added. The material costs of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine continue to grow as Moscow&apos;s forces regularly strike the country&apos;s cities and infrastructure with missiles and drones. The estimated cost of Ukraine&apos;s post-war recovery has risen to $486 billion over a 10-year period, the World Bank said in February. Kyiv has been searching for new sources of income, both at home and abroad, to cover these needs.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-30-nations-eu-adopt-declaration-in-support-of-ukraines-recovery/	2024-09-25T23:49:26-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/b5add7458d49a8184a52e165f82ffd46_1727302903_extra_large.jpeg
Opinion: As Russia circumvents sanctions, Europe faces a strategic crossroads	Returning from their summer recess, European Union leaders have a packed agenda. At the top of the list are strengthening the bloc&#x2019;s readiness for conflict and bolstering its economic competitiveness. For decades, the EU relied on economic influence as a substitute for hard power. But in an era of renewed geopolitical tensions, soft power is not sufficient. The evidence of this comes in many forms. If Europe&#x2019;s shrinking industrial base and scramble to adjust to the reality of de-globalization are not convincing enough, Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine surely must be. That conflict has not only upended the long-held belief that full-scale wars in Europe belonged to the past; it has also demonstrated the limits of economic ties and levers to shape countries&#x2019; behavior. Despite facing one of the most expansive sanctions regimes in history, Russia&#x2019;s economy grew by 5.4% in the first quarter of this year, and 4% in the second &#x2013; well above the global average. A key reason for this resilience is that Russia has found ways to circumvent sanctions and acquire restricted goods, including defense and high-tech products. More than half of the battlefield equipment that Russia obtained between February and August of 2022 contained components made in Europe or the United States. And the majority of the semiconductors being exported from China and Hong Kong to Russia &#x2013; a trade that has surged tenfold since the war started &#x2013; originated with U.S. manufacturers. The Western firms producing those goods, however, are not reaping the full profits of this trade, which is happening largely through complex networks involving third countries. It is no coincidence that Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, and several Central Asian countries have drastically increased their trade with both Russia and Europe since the 2022 invasion. Kazakhstan has a relatively small tech industry, yet its tech exports to Russia surged from $40 million in 2021 to $298 million in 2023. Russia&#x2019;s success at circumventing sanctions &#x2013; often at high cost to Western businesses &#x2013; has forced European policymakers to scramble to adapt. While 14 rounds of sanctions have been introduced in two and a half years, Europe&#x2019;s leaders have so far failed to devise effective solutions. The new trade with Russia is simply too lucrative for intermediary countries to pass up. While the EU could step up its pressure on these countries, using either carrots (like aid packages) or sticks (secondary sanctions), coercion would create its own challenges, and it could undermine Europe&#x2019;s economic and security interests.

(Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Intermediaries are also handling goods headed in the opposite direction: as the EU has sought to reduce its energy dependence on Russia, it has often ended up importing refined Russian fuel at inflated prices via third countries, such as India. Even in terms of direct energy imports, many EU countries continue to rely on Russia. Austria now gets a staggering 98% of its natural gas from Russia&#x2019;s state energy company, Gazprom, with the share having risen since the start of the Ukraine war. Moreover, the EU&#x2019;s imports of liquefied natural gas from Russia surged by 37.7% between 2021 and 2023. Given that LNG is particularly expensive, this has further exacerbated energy costs &#x2013; and internal discord. The EU&#x2019;s failure to update its fragmented and reactive energy framework has left it unable to balance geopolitical considerations with economic realities. This has not only eroded the bloc&#x2019;s soft power &#x2013; including its international credibility and its economic competitiveness &#x2013; but also has undermined its ability to invest in strengthening its hard power. This situation calls for a fundamental rethink of Europe&#x2019;s priorities and policies, argues Mario Draghi, a former head of the European Central Bank and prime minister of Italy, in a just-released report. For example, he suggests that the EU should break its habit of blocking mergers over competition concerns &#x2013; a practice that has often kept European firms too small to compete globally &#x2013; and instead introduce a new regime for monitoring potentially problematic mergers after they happen. More broadly, Draghi argues that the EU must urgently strengthen its industrial base, simplify its regulatory framework, and increase investment in defense and innovation. Without these reforms &#x2013; designed carefully and implemented quickly &#x2013; the EU risks falling even further behind at a time when it can ill afford to. The stakes will grow only higher if Donald Trump returns for a second term in the White House, which would surely lead to the U.S. becoming a far less reliable partner, leaving Europe&#x2019;s security and economy even more vulnerable than they already are.

Opinion: Achieving peace through strength in Ukraine	Russian President Vladimir Putin denies Ukraine&#x2019;s right to sovereignty, having invaded it twice since 2014. Thankfully, his efforts to subjugate the country have been thwarted by the courage of the Ukrainian people. After two and a half years of fiercely defending their homeland, it has become abundantly clear that Ukrainians will never submit to Russian tyranny. But despite their resilience, Putin&#x2019;s brutal war of aggression continues. If Ukraine&#x2019;s allies fail to show the necessary resolve, the conflict could drag on for years, undermining European stability. Moreover, an increasingly militaristic Russia threatens not only Ukraine but the entire world, with potentially catastrophic consequences. Russia&#x2019;s war has already sent shockwaves around the world, driving up energy and food prices and jeopardizing nuclear safety. By violating fundamental principles of international law, Russia has destabilized the global order. To promote peace, Ukraine&#x2019;s allies must make Putin understand that he cannot dictate the terms of how the war will end. They can do this by building global support for a peace agreement rooted in the fundamental principles of international law, strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s position on the battlefield, providing long-term security guarantees, and outlining a clear path to NATO accession. While Putin aims to prolong the war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is actively pursuing a sustainable peace. This summer, he gathered representatives from more than 90 countries in Switzerland to rally support for his ten-point peace formula, which calls for strengthening nuclear safety and addressing the conflict&#x2019;s environmental repercussions, in addition to full Russian withdrawal. Global pressure will be critical to reaching an agreement, but enduring peace also requires strong security guarantees. Given that Russia has repeatedly shown its disregard for international law and basic human rights by violating treaties and committing widespread war crimes, peace cannot rest on Putin&#x2019;s promises alone. The outcome of the war will depend on Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to defend itself. President Volodymyr Zelensky (C) is welcomed by Switzerland&apos;s Ambassador to Ukraine Felix Baumann (L) and Deputy Head of Swiss Protocol Manuel Irman (R) as he arrives at the Zurich airport on June 14, 2024, ahead of the Ukraine Peace Summit in Switzerland. (Michael Buholzer/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)The immediate priority is to improve Ukraine&#x2019;s position on the battlefield. As Russian missiles and drones continue to kill civilians across the country, with most attacks launched from Russian territory, Ukraine has every right to deploy long-range weapons to hit these targets and enter Russia to prevent further assaults. Limiting its ability to do so is essentially asking it to fight with one arm tied behind its back. Ukrainian forces have consistently shown they can use Western-supplied weapons effectively and responsibly. It is time for allies to lift any remaining restrictions on the types of weapons delivered and how they can be used. But along with immediate support, Ukraine&#x2019;s allies must commit to providing it with military equipment and financial resources for as long as needed. Ukraine has already received long-term security guarantees from more than 30 countries as part of the Kyiv Security Compact, which we co-authored. Now is the time to prove that these guarantees have teeth. In the coming months, our efforts will focus on ensuring that the guarantees deliver on their promise. This involves monitoring their implementation, assessing evolving threats, and highlighting the ways Ukraine&#x2019;s security needs align with Europe&#x2019;s broader defense strategy. Preventing Putin from winning the peace will require more than security guarantees. Ukraine&#x2019;s allies should expand their support by taking steps like training Ukrainian forces within the country and deploying civilian contractors or specialized military teams to repair damaged equipment on-site. Neighboring allies could establish an extended air-defense shield over Western Ukraine to intercept incoming Russian missiles and drones, thereby saving civilian lives and enabling Ukraine to redeploy its air-defense systems to the front lines. Each of these steps will undoubtedly strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s position in any future negotiations. But ultimately, the only way to ensure long-term peace and security in Europe is to bring Ukraine into NATO. Leaving Ukraine in the grey zone between Russia and the Alliance would only invite more instability, aggression, and violence. NATO leaders must act decisively and offer Ukraine a path to membership. While this does not mean that Ukraine will join overnight, such a commitment would send a strong message to Putin that his war will not prevent its eventual accession. Faced with Putin&#x2019;s heavily militarized and increasingly revanchist Russia, Ukraine and its allies must embrace the ancient Roman maxim si vis pacem, para bellum (&#x201C;If you want peace, prepare for war&#x201D;). Over the past two and a half years, the Ukrainian people have demonstrated an unwavering determination to defend their freedom. But to achieve lasting peace, the international community must muster the courage and strength to support and maintain it.

Multiple waves of explosions in Kyiv, 1 injured	Multiple waves of explosions were heard in Kyiv overnight on Sept. 26. Air defense systems were active for a long time, and drone debris was found in the Pecherskyi district, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko. Emergency services were called to the district due to a fire on the first floor of a residential building caused by falling debris. The Kyiv City Military Administration (KMVA) confirmed that a child was injured during the nighttime attack using Shahed drones and was hospitalized with multiple wounds. Authorities are continuing to assess the damage and monitor the situation as further updates come in.	https://kyivindependent.com/multiple-waves-of-explosions-in-kyiv-1-injured/	2024-09-25T21:58:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/fire.jpg
US raises concerns over alleged Russian drone production in China	According to a White House spokesperson, the U.S. expressed deep concern over a Reuters report claiming that Russia has established a secret drone production project in China. The Reuters report suggests that a Chinese company is providing lethal assistance to a U.S.-- sanctioned Russian firm, IEMZ Kupol, which is developing drones for use in Ukraine. A White House National Security Council (NSC) spokesperson stated there is no indication that the Chinese government was aware of these transactions, but emphasized that China is responsible for ensuring its companies are not involved in providing lethal aid to Russia. The NSC spokesperson added that China&#x2019;s efforts to prevent such activities &quot;are clearly not meeting the mark&quot; and that the U.S. may take action against Chinese companies involved. A NATO spokesperson also commented on the issue via email, stating: &quot;These reports are deeply concerning and Allies are consulting on this matter.&quot; The report also notes that these drones have been delivered to Russia, although China denies knowledge of the project and maintains strict export controls on drones. China has positioned itself as neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war but has simultaneously deepened economic ties with Moscow and backed the country against Western sanctions. Beijing has also emerged as one of Russia&apos;s leading sources of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-raises-concerns-over-alleged-russian-drone-production-in-china/	2024-09-25T21:32:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1244030448-1665987223fwizj.jpg

Some Western leaders 'unimpressed' with Ukraine's victory plan, WSJ reports	The White House is concerned that President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s victory plan for Ukraine lacks a clear strategy to win against Russia, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Sept. 25, citing U.S. and European officials. Zelensky is set to present the details of his much-anticipated plan to U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris during a White House visit on Sept. 26. The plan includes military and diplomatic components, including Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO, but the full details of the peace framework have not yet been publicized. The goal of the plan is to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s future negotiating position and push Russia to make a just peace. Some officials familiar with the plan&apos;s outlines said it focuses too heavily on requesting more weapons and lifting restrictions on long-range missile strikes. &quot;I&apos;m unimpressed, there&apos;s not much new there,&quot; one senior official told the WSJ. A key part of the plan hinges on the U.S. and Western countries allowing Ukraine to use long-range weapons to hit targets deep within Russia, Finnish President Alexander Stubb said. If the U.S. does not grant those permissions, Ukraine&apos;s proposals will be &quot;less relevant,&quot; he told the WSJ. White House officials are worried that Zelensky&apos;s plan does not offer clear, actionable steps that Biden can support in his four remaining months in office, the WSJ reported. U.S. and European officials told the WSJ that parts of the plan remain underdeveloped, and that requests related to weapons are the must specific and detailed. The Biden administration has been reluctant to grant wider permission for Kyiv to use U.S.-supplied weapons to strike military targets on Russian territory, citing the possibility of escalation with Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin played into those fears ahead of Zelensky&apos;s visit to the White House, proposing changes to Russia&apos;s nuclear doctrine at a Security Council meeting on Sept. 25. Putin said Russia could interpret any &quot;aggression by a non-nuclear state with the participation of a nuclear state&quot; as a &quot;joint attack&quot; against Russia. Putin&apos;s nuclear warnings come as multiple Western outlets, including Politico and the Guardian, have reported that the U.S. and U.K. are considering shifting their positions on long-range strikes and preparing plans to ease current restrictions. Biden said on Sept. 25 that he plans to announce a number of support measures for Ukraine during Zelensky&apos;s visit. &quot;Tomorrow, I will announce a series of actions to accelerate support for Ukraine&apos;s military,&quot; he said. The announcement will reportedly include over $8 billion in military aid to Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/some-us-leaders-unimpressed-with-ukraines-victory-plan-wsj-reports/	2024-09-25T16:51:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174503209.jpg
White House announces $375 million in military assistance to Ukraine	The U.S. has authorized a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $375 million, the White House announced on Sept. 25. The aid includes air-to-ground weapons, munitions for rocket systems, armored vehicles, and anti-tank weapons. The assistance comes via the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA), which U.S. President Joe Biden authorized on Sept. 25. Prior to the announcement, Biden pledged ongoing support to Kyiv in a Joint Declaration of Support for Recovery and Reconstruction of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/white-house-announces-375-million-in-military-assistance-to-ukraine/	2024-09-25T15:11:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174506605.jpg
US to announce 'series of actions' supporting Ukraine, Biden says	The United States on Sept. 26 will announce &quot;a series of actions to accelerate support&quot; for Ukraine in its fight against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and future recovery, U.S. President Joe Biden said on Sept. 25. Biden convened with President Volodymyr Zelensky and other world leaders on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York City on Sept. 25 to launch a Joint Declaration of Support for Ukraine&apos;s Recovery and Reconstruction. &quot;I&apos;m determined to ensure that Ukraine has what it needs to prevail in its fight for survival,&quot; Biden said. &quot;Tomorrow, I will announce a series of actions to accelerate support for Ukraine&apos;s military.&quot; The announcement will likely to include a package worth $8 billion in military assistance, Reuters reported earlier on Sept. 25. Zelensky will visit the White House on Sept. 26 to outline his five-point victory plan for Ukraine to Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Biden said that U.S. support will cover Ukraine&apos;s needs on the battlefield as well as its economic recovery. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s economy is resilient, and together, we can help Ukraine go from economic resilience to economic revival,&quot; he said. Biden did not detail what type of military support the U.S. will announce during Zelensky&apos;s visit. Kyiv has been aggressively lobbying Washington to lift restrictions on the use of long-range U.S. weapons to strike military targets within Russia, a step the Biden administration has not yet been willing to take for fear of escalation with Moscow. Ahead of Zelensky&apos;s White House visit, Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed changes to Russia&apos;s nuclear doctrine at a Security Council meeting on Sept. 25. The proposed amendments include treating &quot;aggression by a non-nuclear state with the participation of a nuclear state&quot; as a &quot;joint attack&quot; against Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-announce-series-of-actions-supporting-ukraine-biden-says/	2024-09-25T14:49:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173583735.jpg
Trump slams Zelensky for refusing to 'make a deal' with Moscow	Former U.S. President and current Republican nominee Donald Trump criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky at a campaign rally on Sept. 25, accusing Zelensky of refusing to &quot;make a deal&quot; with Russia and &quot;making little nasty aspersions&quot; against Trump. The comments come as Zelensky visits the U.S. to rally support for Ukraine&apos;s global peace summit among world leaders and present his five-point victory plan to American leadership. Zelensky has reportedly not scheduled any meetings with Trump. &quot;The president of Ukraine is in our country and he&apos;s making little nasty aspersions toward your favorite president, me,&quot; Trump said during a campaign speech in the U.S. state of North Carolina. &quot;We continue to give billions of dollars to a man who refuses to make a deal: Zelensky.&quot; At a rally the previous day, Trump vowed to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the war in Ukraine if elected president. Trump&apos;s rhetoric against Zelensky and U.S. support for Ukraine has grown harsher in recent days. He has claimed that Zelensky wants Democrats to win the upcoming presidential election and referred to him as &quot;the greatest salesman on earth.&quot; Republican leaders on Sept. 25 also accused Zelensky of interfering in the election by visiting an ammunition factory in U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s hometown of Scranton, Pennyslvania, a hotly contested battleground state. House Speaker Mike Johnson demanded that Zelensky fire Ukraine&apos;s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Makarovka, for her role in arranging the tour. The Republican chair of the House Oversight Committee also announced he was opening an investigation into the Biden-Harris administration&apos;s alleged misuse of government funds. Zelensky criticized Trump&apos;s plans for an end to the war in an interview with the New Yorker earlier this week. He called Trump&apos;s running mate, Republican Senator J.D. Vance, &quot;too radical&quot; and said the war should not end at Ukraine&apos;s expense.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-slams-zelensky-for-refusing-to-make-a-deal-with-moscow/	2024-09-25T13:52:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173584604.jpg
US to announce $8 billion military aid package when Zelensky visits White House, Reuters reports	The United States is preparing a military aid package for Ukraine worth over $8 billion, Reuters reported on Sept. 25, citing two U.S. officials. The U.S. plans to announce the new aid package when President Volodymyr Zelensky visits the White House on Sept. 26, officials said. U.S. President Joe Biden has been working with Congress to extend $5.8 billion in military funding for Ukraine before it expires at the end of September. A second announcement on Sept. 26 will allocate $2.4 billion under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. The second package will include munitions, anti-drone weapons, and material to support ammunition production in Ukraine, one of the officials told Reuters. The U.S. is also expected to announce a $375 million aid package for Ukraine later on Sept. 25, ahead of Zelensky&apos;s visit, the officials said. The officials confirmed reports that this package will include a medium-range glide bomb known as the Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW). The missile has a range of up to 130 kilometers (81 miles) and can be dropped from F-16 fighter jets. Zelensky is expected to visit the White House on Sept. 26 to present his victory plan for Ukraine to Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Zelensky arrived in the U.S. on Sept. 22 and has spent the past week meeting with world leaders on the sidelines of the 79th U.N. General Assembly. He addressed the assembly on Sept. 25, calling on member nations to rally around Ukraine&apos;s peace formula.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-announce-8-billion-military-aid-package-when-zelensky-visits-white-house-reuters-reports/	2024-09-25T13:06:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/--------------2024-03-19-202210.png

Putin suggests changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine	Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed a series of changes to Russia&apos;s nuclear doctrine on Sept. 25 during a Security Council meeting on nuclear deterrence, Russia&apos;s state-owned outlet Ria Novosti reported. Throughout the war, the Kremlin has repeatedly laid down red lines, which it has said could provoke a nuclear response if crossed. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Sep. 1 that Russia will change its nuclear doctrine based on an analysis of recent conflicts and the West&apos;s &quot;escalation course.&quot; Work on drafting the doctrinal changes is at &quot;an advanced stage,&quot; Ryabkov reported at the time without revealing any details as to the changes being introduced. &quot;An aggression by a non-nuclear state with the participation of a nuclear state is proposed to be considered as their joint attack on Russia,&quot; Putin said during the Security Council meeting on Sept. 25. Moscow also retains the right to use nuclear weapons in the event of an attack, including if the enemy, using conventional weapons, poses a critical threat to Russia and Belarus, Putin added. The Russian president said these changes were made in agreement with Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko. According to the new suggestions, Russia may consider the use of nuclear weapons after receiving information about a massive launch of missiles or drones crossing its state border. Putin said that the nuclear &quot;triad&quot; remains the most important guarantee of Russia&apos;s and its citizens&apos; security. The new draft nuclear doctrine also contains an expanded list of countries and military alliances, as well as a list of military threats, he added. The Russian government did not specify a date when the proposals for changes to the nuclear doctrine would come into force. The head of the Presidential Office, Andriy Yermak, responded to Putin&apos;s statements by saying that &quot;Russia has nothing else but nuclear blackmail, no other tools to intimidate the world.&quot; &quot;These tools will not work,&quot; he added. Putin approved a nuclear doctrine in 2020, which listed for the first time the threats against which nuclear weapons could be deployed. Among other provisions, it states that Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons if nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction are used against it or its allies. Russian forces can also deploy their nuclear arsenal in response to any conventional weapons if Russia&apos;s existence is threatened. The country&apos;s president decides on the use of nuclear arms, it adds. Yet, in late February 2024, journalists from the Financial Times (FT) were able to obtain access to secret Russian documents related to Russia&apos;s tactical nuclear weapons. The threshold for the use of these weapons by Russia is much lower than Russian officials have publicly claimed, the FT said. According to the media outlet, the Russian military could also use them to &quot;deter states from aggression&quot; or &quot;escalating military conflicts.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-suggests-number-of-changes-to-russias-nuclear-doctrine/	2024-09-25T12:13:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169947960-1.jpg
There can be no just peace without Ukraine' — Zelensky's full speech at the UN General Assembly	Editor&apos;s Note: The following is the full translated transcript of a speech delivered by President Volodymyr Zelensky at the UN General Assembly on Sept 25. It was published by the President&apos;s Office online and is republished here without changes. Zelensky delivered the address in English. Dear leaders, Your excellencies, Today, I want to tell you about a day that has already passed, and a day that must never come. On the night of March 4th, 2022, I received one of the most terrifying reports since the beginning of a full-scale Russian invasion against Ukraine. The report was about Russian tanks firing directly at the buildings of our Ukrainian nuclear power plant. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. The largest one in Europe. Six nuclear reactors. The Russian army stormed this facility just as brutally as any other during this war. Without thinking about the consequences. Possibly disastrous. This was one of the most horrifying moments of the war, when no one could know how Russian strikes on the nuclear facility would end, and everyone in Ukraine was reminded of what Chornobyl means. Now, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains occupied by Russian forces. Unfortunately. And it&#x2019;s at risk of a nuclear incident. This is the major source of radiation danger in Europe, possibly in the world. That&#x2019;s why, in the Peace Formula I presented, the first point is about nuclear safety. In Ukraine, we know exactly what we&#x2019;re dealing with. And I want to thank you &#x2013; the General Assembly members &#x2013; for adopting a resolution in July this year on the safety of nuclear facilities in Ukraine. Most in the world understand &#x2013; what&#x2019;s at stake. The General Assembly demanded that Russia return control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to Ukraine. Only then real nuclear security will return to Europe and the world. And now about the day that must never come. Since Russia can&#x2019;t defeat our people&#x2019;s resistance on the battlefield, Putin is looking for other ways to break the Ukrainian spirit. One of his methods is targeting our energy infrastructure. These are deliberate Russian attacks on our power plants, and the entire energy grid. As of today, Russia has destroyed all our thermal power plants and a large part of our hydroelectric capacity. This is how Putin is preparing for winter &#x2013; hoping to torment millions, millions of Ukrainians&#x2026; Ordinary families &#x2013; women, children&#x2026; Ordinary towns, ordinary villages. Putin wants to leave them in the dark and cold this winter, forcing Ukraine to suffer and surrender. Just imagine, please, your country with 80 percent of its energy system gone &#x2013; with such a destroyed part of the system. What kind of life would that be? Recently, I received yet another alarming report from our intelligence. Now, Putin does seem to be planning attacks on our nuclear power plants and their infrastructure, aiming to disconnect the plants from the power grid. With the help of satellites, by the way, ladies and gentlemen, by the way, satellites of other countries, Russia is getting images and detailed information about the infrastructure of our nuclear power plants. But what does this really threaten? Any missile or drone strike, any critical incident in the energy system, could lead to a nuclear disaster. A day like that must never come. And Moscow needs to understand this. And this depends, in part, on your determination to put pressure on the aggressor. These are nuclear power plants! They must be safe. President Volodymyr Zelensky giving a speech to the UN General Assemnly in New York on Sept. 25 during a trip the the U.S. (President&apos;s Office)&#xA0;Ladies and gentlemen! Two years ago, in the fall of 2022, I proposed a comprehensive strategy to end the war &#x2013; and to ensure security. And I presented the Peace Formula at a highly inclusive political platform for world leaders &#x2013; the G20 Summit in Indonesia &#x2013; representing billions of citizens from all parts of the globe. And it&#x2019;s important for us that all these people can understand us &#x2013; understand that Ukraine wants to end this war more than anyone in the world. War always poses a threat to many. You all see in the media and read in reports what is happening in Ukraine because of Russia&#x2019;s war &#x2013; it&#x2019;s something, many are imagining happening to themselves. And, yes, the smoke from fires in war-torn cities can reach other countries. And if, God forbid, Russia causes a nuclear disaster at one of our nuclear power plants, radiation won&#x2019;t respect state borders, and unfortunately, various nations could feel the devastating effects. Many are concerned, but the deepest understanding of war is always found in the home it destroys. It is the Ukrainian people who feel the full pain of this war. It&#x2019;s Ukrainian children who are learning to distinguish the sounds of different types of artillery and drones because of Russia&#x2019;s war. It&#x2019;s our people who are forcefully separated by occupation because Putin decided he could do whatever he wants. It&#x2019;s our heroic soldiers who are giving their lives to defend our country from invaders trying to steal our land. That&#x2019;s why we say, rightfully so &#x2013; there can be no just peace without Ukraine. And I thank every leader, every country that supports us in this, that understands us &#x2013; that sees how Russia, a country more than twenty times larger than Ukraine in territory, still wants even more land, more land &#x2013; which is insane &#x2013; and is seizing it, day by day, while wanting to destroy its neighbor. And Russia found very special buddies for that &#x2013; North Korea and Iran, a telling choice of friends. Now every neighbor of Russia in Europe and Central Asia feels that the war could come to them as well, and just think &#x2013; what kind of losses that would mean for the world. And I thank nearly one hundred nations and international organizations that have supported the Peace Formula. It&#x2019;s truly a global community &#x2013; Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America, the Pacific region &#x2013; all united by the Peace Formula. And I&#x2019;m glad that the first Peace Summit was so reminding of the UN General Assembly &#x2013; everyone was equal. All nations that participated in the Peace Summit &#x2013; large and small &#x2013; no veto right, no blocking authority. Those that have been independent for ages, and those that have only recently gained independence. Those that have gone through wars themselves, and those accustomed to peace. All. All were equal &#x2013; that is what Russia hates the most and cannot control, that&#x2019;s why Russia says the Peace Formula doesn&#x2019;t suit it. Here at the UN, I&#x2019;ve already met with leaders from India and Guatemala, Japan and Italy, T&#xFC;rkiye and Finland, Canada and Paraguay, Slovenia, Germany and others. And my meetings will continue. These are different, absolutely, parts of the world and various political ways of life, but they share the same understanding &#x2013; peace is needed, and it must be a real, just peace. Unfortunately, at the UN, it&#x2019;s impossible to truly and fairly resolve matters of war and peace because too much depends in the Security Council on the veto power. When the aggressor exercises veto power, the UN is powerless to stop the war. But the Peace Formula can &#x2013; once again, there is no veto power in it. That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s the best opportunity for peace &#x2013; everyone is equal, and it&#x2019;s effective and comprehensive. When some propose alternatives, half-hearted settlement plans &#x2013; so-called &apos;sets of principles&apos; &#x2013; it not only ignores the interests and suffering of Ukrainians, who are affected by the war the most, it not only ignores reality, but also gives Putin the political space to continue the war and pressure the world to bring more nations under control. Any parallel or alternative attempts to seek peace are, in fact, efforts to achieve a lull instead of an end to the war, as a global initiative &#x2013; the Peace Formula &#x2013; has already existed for two years. And maybe somebody wants a Nobel Prize for their political biography for frozen truce instead of real peace, but the only prizes Putin will give you in return are more suffering and disasters. We must restore nuclear safety. Energy must stop being used as a weapon. We must ensure food security. We need to bring home all our captured soldiers and civilians forcibly deported to Russia. We must uphold the UN Charter and guarantee our right &#x2013; Ukraine&#x2019;s right &#x2013; to territorial integrity and sovereignty, just as we do for any other nation. We need to withdraw the Russian occupiers, which will bring an end to the hostilities in Ukraine. We must hold those responsible for war crimes accountable. We need to prevent ecocide and stop the destruction of nature caused by the war. And we must not allow a second or third phase of this Russian invasion. And we need to make it clear &#x2013; the war is over. This is the Peace Formula. What part of this could be unacceptable to anyone who upholds the UN Charter? If someone in the world seeks alternatives to any of these points or tries to ignore any of them, it likely means they themselves want to do a part of what Putin is doing &#x2013; the point they ignore reveals the desire they are hiding. And when the Chinese-Brazilian duo tries to grow into a choir of voices &#x2013; with someone in Europe, with someone in Africa, saying something alternative to a full and just peace, the question arises &#x2013; what is the true interest? Everyone must understand &#x2013; you won&#x2019;t boost your power at Ukraine&#x2019;s expense. And the world has already been through colonial wars and conspiracies of great powers at the expense of those who are smaller. Every country &#x2013; including China, Brazil, European nations, African nations, Middle East &#x2013; all understand why this must remain in the past. And Ukrainians will never accept, will never accept why anyone in the world believes that such a brutal colonial past, which suits no one today, can be imposed on Ukraine now instead of a normal, peaceful life. I want peace for my people &#x2013; real peace and just peace. And I&#x2019;m asking for your support &#x2013; from all nations of the world. We do not divide the world. I ask the same of you &#x2013; do not divide the world. Be united Nations, and that will bring us peace. Thank you. Glory to Ukraine!	https://kyivindependent.com/there-can-be-no-just-peace-without-ukraine-zelenskys-full-speech-at-the-un-general-assembly/	2024-09-25T11:44:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/b52349f90283f7dd654e9fb2e49e20e1_1727278641_extra_large.jpeg
Ukraine war latest: Russia preparing to attack 3 nuclear power plants in Ukraine, Zelensky says	Key developments on Sept. 25: Russia is preparing to target three Ukrainian nuclear power plants, President Volodymyr Zelensky told the U.N. Security Council in New York on Sept. 24. &quot;If Russia is ready to go that far, it means nothing you value matters to Moscow. This kind of Russian cynicism will keep striking if it&#x2019;s given any room in the world,&quot; he said. Zelensky did not specify which stations are under threat but said Kyiv had evidence and &quot;proof&quot; of Russia&apos;s plans. There are three operating nuclear power plants on the Ukrainian-held territory &#x2014; Rivne and Khmelnytskyi NPPs in the country&apos;s west, and Pivdennoukrainsk NPP in the south. Russia&apos;s regular attacks put their safety in jeopardy by cutting off power to the units. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe&apos;s largest nuclear power station, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. Throughout its occupation, the plant has been repeatedly disconnected from the Ukrainian power grid due to Russian attacks on the country&apos;s energy infrastructure. There have been mounting warnings from Kyiv in recent days about such attacks. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Sept. 21 that Russia&apos;s possible targets include open distribution devices at nuclear power plants and transmission substations &quot;which are essential for the safe functioning of the nuclear energy system.&quot; Earlier on Sept. 24, Zelensky said that Russia is using Chinese satellites to take pictures of Ukraine&apos;s nuclear facilities for possible future attacks. Ukraine&apos;s special services informed Kyiv&apos;s partners and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) about the threat. Russian troops have not yet reached the outskirts of the embattled town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said on Sept. 25. &quot;There is no enemy on the outskirts of the town yet. Sabotage and reconnaissance groups are coming in, but our defenders are trying to knock them out. This means that the town is not yet captured,&quot; he said on national television. &quot;Our defenders are doing everything possible and impossible. They burned a lot of enemy equipment.&quot; The front-line town lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The 72nd Mechanized Brigade has defended Vuhledar for nearly two years, as Russian forces have been trying to capture the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Filashkin said Russian forces are trying to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense line near Vuhledar and &quot;are advancing.&quot; According to the crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState, Russian forces are aiming to encircle the town. Around 100 people remain in Vuhledar refusing to leave, Filashkin added. Andrii Kovalenko, head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, said on Sept. 24 that Russia has devastated the town of Vuhledar and is attempting to advance from the flanks. Vuhledar has withstood numerous attacks since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022 and has become key to Ukrainian defenses in the southern part of Donetsk Oblast. &quot;The loss of Vuhledar would be not only a morale blow for Ukraine since this city has resisted plenty of assaults since 2022, but also a very serious development that can potentially threaten the security of the entire southwestern portion of Donetsk Oblast not yet occupied, along with the threat to Pokrovsk&apos;s southern flank,&quot; Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent earlier this month. Ukrainian forces captured around 20 Russian soldiers and killed &quot;several dozen&quot; others during an operation to recapture an aggregate plant in the town of Vovchansk, Kharkiv Oblast, a member of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) claimed on Sept. 25. Speaking to national television, a HUR special forces officer with the call sign Viking revealed details of the operation, adding that a further four Russian soldiers &quot;tried to leave the plant and were neutralized outside the perimeter.&quot; &quot;The battle lasted a little over a week. There was intense shelling from the enemy. The enemy at the factory put up a lot of resistance, but in the end, we completed the task,&quot; he said. Russian troops had been in control of the Vovchansk plant for several months before the facility was recaptured on Sept. 24., HUR previously reported. &quot;The plant is destroyed and damaged. But it is possible to maintain a defense there,&quot; Viking said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. HUR Chief Kyrylo Budanov was briefed on the &quot;successful completion of the operation,&quot; HUR said in a statement on Sept. 24, adding the &quot;extremely difficult&quot; attack was carried out by the agency&apos;s special forces. &quot;The fighters of HUR carried out a systematic sweep of the plant&apos;s buildings, constantly engaging in contact battles with the enemy in densely built-up conditions. In some cases, Ukrainian special forces engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy,&quot; it claimed. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces took the territory of the aggregate plant under control after all 30 buildings were cleared (of Russian forces).&quot; Vovchansk is an embattled town some 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Kharkiv that has seen heavy battles since Russia launched a new offensive in the area in May. While initially gaining ground, the Russian offensive in northern Kharkiv Oblast has quickly bogged down, with Russian troops reportedly suffering heavy losses. The intensity of fighting has decreased somewhat compared to other sectors in Ukraine&apos;s east near Pokrovsk, Vuhledar, and Toretsk. Ukraine has developed a three-year plan for the production of drones, electronic warfare equipment, and ground robotic systems, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said in an interview with Lb.ua media outlet published on Sept. 24. Described as &quot;very thorough and extensive,&quot; the document on Ukrainian manufacturing was presented during Umerov&apos;s recent trips to the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, as well as at the Ramstein meeting earlier this month. &quot;We looked at how many of them (drones, electronic warfare, ground robotic systems) we needed and how we would use them at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels,&quot; the minister said. The plan also includes the specific number of weapons that Ukraine can produce and the funds needed, Umerov added without elaborating. &quot;There are already several countries today that have agreed to finance our drones and missiles,&quot; Umerov added. The Ukrainian military has proven to be a pioneer in drone technology, using innovative ways to undermine Russia&apos;s ammunition and personnel advantage. According to Umerov, Ukraine has destroyed or damaged over 200 military facilities in Russia over the past year using &quot;drone swarm&quot; technology. Kyiv says it uses domestically-produced drones to hit targets on Russian soil amid ongoing pressure on its partners to lift restrictions on deep strikes with Western-supplied weapons. Kyiv has the production capacity to produce more than 3 million drones a year but requires financing from foreign partners, Deputy Strategic Industries Minister Hanna Hvozdiar said in July. Russia has secretly established a development and production program in China for attack drones to be used in the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported on Sept. 25 citing European intelligence sources and documents reviewed by the outlet. According to the report, Russia has flight-tested a new drone called the Garpiya-3 (G3) in China with the help of local specialists. Details of the project were revealed in a report by the company behind the project, IEMZ Kupol, a subsidiary of the Kremlin-owned weapons company Almaz-Antey. China has positioned itself as neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war but has simultaneously deepened economic ties with Moscow and backed the country against Western sanctions. Beijing has also emerged as one of Russia&apos;s leading sources of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry. In a comment to Reuters, China&apos;s foreign ministry denied knowledge of the G3 project. In an interview with ABC News aired on Sept. 24., President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is using Chinese satellites to take pictures of Ukraine&apos;s nuclear facilities for possible future attacks. &quot;The recent information is that Russia has been using Chinese satellites and taking photos of the details of the objects on nuclear facilities,&quot; the president said. &quot;And in our experience, if Russia takes photos of certain objects, then there is a threat of strikes against the nuclear objects.&quot; He did not elaborate on whether Chinese satellites were commercial or controlled by the Chinese government.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-sept-25/	2024-09-25T11:39:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1243158341.jpg

Russia has destroyed all thermal power plants, nearly all hydroelectric capacity in Ukraine ahead of winter, Zelensky says	Russia destroyed all thermal power plants and almost all hydroelectric capacity in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 25 during his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. Russia launched nine coordinated attacks against Ukraine&apos;s electricity infrastructure between March and August, striking facilities in 20 oblasts. According to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter as a result of the attacks, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand. This summer, the power shortage was 2.5 GW when Kyiv was already experiencing long blackouts. &quot;This is how Putin is preparing for winter &#x2014; hoping to torment millions, millions of Ukrainians&#x2026; Ordinary families &#x2014; women, children&#x2026; Ordinary towns, ordinary villages,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Putin wants to leave them in the dark and cold this winter, forcing Ukraine to suffer and surrender. Just imagine, please, your country with 80 percent of its energy system gone &#x2014; with such a destroyed part of the system. What kind of life would that be?&quot; the president added. From October 2022 to September 2024, Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure facilities suffered 1024 Russian attacks, according to the Energy Ministry. Zelensky told the U.N. Security Council on Sept. 24 that Russia was preparing to target three Ukrainian nuclear power plants. There are three operating nuclear power plants on the Ukrainian-held territory &#x2014; the Rivne and Khmelnytskyi plants in the country&apos;s west, and the Pivdennoukrainsk plant in the south. Russia&apos;s regular attacks put their safety in jeopardy by cutting off power to the units. According to the Energy Ministry, nuclear generation currently accounts for up to 60% of the country&apos;s electricity consumption. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe&apos;s largest nuclear power station, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-destroys-all-thermal-power-plants-nearly-all-hydroelectric-capacity-in-ukraine-ahead-of-winter-zelensky-says/	2024-09-25T11:07:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170870951.jpg
Zelensky's stance on 'forcing' Russia to make peace 'fatal mistake,' Kremlin says	President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s stance on &quot;forcing&quot; Russia to peace is a &quot;fatal mistake&quot; and will have &quot;consequences for Ukraine,&quot; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Sept. 25, according to Russia&apos;s state-owned Ria Novosti outlet. Peskov&apos;s statement comes after Zelensky&apos;s speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, in which he said that Russian President Vladimir Putin had violated so many international laws that he would not stop &quot;on his own, so Russia could only be forced to peace.&quot; &quot;In my view, this stance is a fatal mistake. A fatal mistake, a systemic mistake, this is a profound misconception, which, of course, will inevitably have consequences for (Ukraine),&quot; Peskov said in answer to a question about Zelensky&apos;s speech. Peskov said that Russia &quot;could not be forced to peace, adding that Moscow is allegedly &quot;committed to peace,&quot; despite its war in Ukraine. Zelensky arrived in the U.S. on Sept. 22, kicking off a nearly week-long visit focused on presenting the president&apos;s &quot;victory plan&quot; to Ukraine&apos;s allies, including U.S. President Joe Biden. Zelensky and Biden will meet at the White House on Sept. 26. Kyiv has remained secretive about the plan&apos;s details. According to Zelensky, the &quot;victory plan&quot; consists of five points, focusing on Ukraine&apos;s security and geopolitical position, foreign military aid with the freedom to use it without restrictions, and economic support. In addition to a NATO invitation and a pledge for arms supplies, Bloomberg previously reported that the plan includes a clear pathway to European Union membership.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelenskys-stance-on-forcing-russia-to-make-peace-fatal-mistake-kremlin-says/	2024-09-25T09:47:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2162102517.jpg
Russia attacks Kramatorsk city center, killing 2, injuring 12, including children	Russian forces attacked the city of Kramatorsk in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 25, killing at least two and injuring 12 people, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Three children are among the injured, he added. Russia targeted the city center with three guided aerial bombs, damaging two high-rise buildings, shops, and cars. Emergency services are working at the scene, according to Filashkin. The aftermath of the Russian strike against the city of Kramatorsk in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 25, 2024.

Kramatorsk comes under regular Russian attacks. A strike on a restaurant in the city center, popular with volunteers, journalists, and soldiers, in June 2023 killed 13 people and injured dozens of others. The well-known Ukrainian writer Victoria Amelina was seriously injured in the June 2023 strike and later died in hospital.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-attacks-kramatorsk-city-center-killing-2-injuring-12/	2024-09-25T08:57:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2024-09-25-17_55_05.jpeg
Death toll in Russia's Sept. 24 attack on Kharkiv rises to 4	The death toll in the Sept. 24 Russian attack on Kharkiv has risen to four people, as rescuers found the body of a woman under the rubble of a damaged building, Mayor Ihor Terekhov reported on Sept. 25. Russia bombarded the city with guided aerial bombs, targeting densely populated districts. Two high-rise residential buildings were struck in the Kyivskyi and Saltivskyi districts. The attack killed a total of four people and injured 34. The youngest victim is a 17-year-old girl, while the oldest is an 87-year-old woman, according to Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov. The woman&apos;s body was found on Sept. 25 under the rubble of the building in the Kyivskyi district, which Russian forces attacked for the second time since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Following the first strike, the building was repaired, insulated, and prepared for winter, but it was hit again by a Russian guided aerial bomb. Some 82 people lived in the section that had suffered the most severe damage, according to Terekhov. The recent Russian strikes also damaged a bakery plant, a recreation center, a sports ground, a kindergarten, several windows in apartment buildings, and a supermarket. Russia reportedly used FAB-250 and FAB-500 guided aerial bombs. Kharkiv has been under constant Russian attacks for more than two years since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/death-toll-in-russias-sept-24-attack-on-kharkiv-rises-to-4/	2024-09-25T08:20:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173419941.jpg
Lammy calls Putin head of 'mafia state,' compares him to slave owner	U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of running a &quot;mafia state&quot; and compared him to a slave owner during his speech at a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Sept. 24. Lammy, who took over as British Foreign Secretary in July 2024, has consistently reiterated his country&apos;s support for Ukraine and condemned Russia&apos;s attacks against Ukrainian civilians and violations of international law. Lammy criticized Putin&apos;s actions regarding the invasion of Ukraine, recalling the days of slavery, and accused the Russian government of flouting international law, while claiming to be defending the so-called Global South. &quot;Your invasion is in your own interests,&quot; he said, addressing Putin. &quot;Yours alone. To expand your mafia state into a mafia empire. An empire built on corruption.&quot; &quot;Mr. President (Putin), I speak not only as a Briton, as a Londoner, and as a foreign secretary. &quot; &quot;But I say to the Russian representative (in the U.N. Security Council), on his phone as I speak, that I stand here also as a Black man whose ancestors were taken in chains from Africa, at the barrel of a gun to be enslaved, whose ancestors rose up and fought in a great rebellion of the enslaved,&quot; Lammy added. U.K. Foreign Secretary said that he recognizes &quot;imperialism&quot; in the actions of the Russian authorities, adding that &quot;he will call it out for what it is.&quot; Lammy delivered his speech at the U.N. Security Council as Ukraine continues to seek permission to use long-range Western weapons, including British-made Storm Shadow missiles, to strike deep into Russia. Storm Shadow missiles are only allowed to be used on Ukraine&apos;s territory for now. Ukraine has reportedly used Storm Shadow missiles, with a range of up to 250 kilometers (150 miles), to hit Russian military targets in Crimea, a sovereign Ukrainian territory illegally annexed by Russia. The Telegraph reported in August, citing unnamed sources, that the U.K. was privately in favor of allowing Ukraine to use Storm Shadow missiles in strikes on Russia, but was unwilling to publicly press for such a change in policy due to fears of backlash from the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/lammy-calls-putin-head-of-mafia-state-compares-him-to-slave-owner/	2024-09-25T07:34:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172936127.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — Hotels and tax hikes	The following is the Sept. 25, 2024 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. Kyiv&#x2019;s iconic &#x201C;Hotel Ukraina,&#x201D; located on the city&#x2019;s central Independence Square, also known as Maidan Nezalezhnosti, was sold in an auction for Hr 2.5 billion ($60 million) after being state-owned since its construction in 1961. Why now? It may seem strange that such a large asset was privatized during a full-scale war. The auction is actually part of the government&#x2019;s &#x201C;Big Privatization&#x201D; initiative to offload its long list of state-owned properties to raise money for the country&#x2019;s wartime budget needs. Privatization is a tricky subject in this part of the world. While it was supposed to facilitate a transition from a planned to a market economy in the wake of the USSR&#x2019;s collapse, mass privatization in the 1990s did little else besides help a few oligarchs get really rich buying valuable state assets for really cheap. Many major enterprises in the country never got privatized. In fact, the Ukrainian government is still the largest owner of assets in the country, with thousands of companies owned by the state. In 2020, the Economy Ministry put the number at 3,343. The figure has undoubtedly only gotten larger during the full-scale invasion, as the state has nationalized some companies, many of which were owned by Russians or other sanctioned individuals. The sale of Hotel Ukraina is one of the first large-scale privatizations in recent years, which seems like a win for the state&#x2019;s privatization efforts. The highest bidder? Little-known Ukrainian businessman Maksym Krippa, who seems to be on a bit of a shopping spree in Kyiv real estate these days. He partly owns the nearby Dnipro Hotel and in 2023, bought the Parus skyscraper in downtown Kyiv. He also owns a few, smaller business centers in the city. In addition to real estate, Krippa is also the owner of the Ukrainian e-sports team Navi, as well as the well-known Stalker video game series. In a brief, written interview for Forbes Ukraine after the Hotel Ukraina bid, Krippa said his business interests also include IT. Regarding the hotel, Krippa declined to divulge any details on how he plans to invest in the property &#x2014; in need of serious capital to bring it into the modern age &#x2014; but reassured Forbes that he and his team &#x201C;have a plan on how to develop the facility.&#x201D; But Krippa also told Forbes that no renovations would start until the war is over and Ukraine is victorious. In other words, the property may have switched hands, but its development is likely still a distant prospect. &#x201C;I don&apos;t even know what to say. This is a nightmare. This will hit the white business hard,&#x201D; Tatyana Izovit, chairman of the board of the Ukrainian Association of enterprises of textile &amp; leather industry, told told Liga.net, referring to the recent tax increase passed in the first reading by Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament. If you&#x2019;ve been following our reporting on the Ukrainian government&#x2019;s moves to raise taxes &#x2014; the first time since the start of the full-scale war &#x2014; you&#x2019;ve likely seen that businesses in Ukraine feel the increase is totally unfair. In their view, the government should go after illegal businesses and goods that cause billions of dollars of losses in unpaid taxes to the state instead of tax-paying individuals and businesses, known as white businesses in Ukraine. A lot of these losses are often the result of corruption schemes in customs. But the war is raging and Ukraine needs to bring more money to the budget. Raising taxes is one way to do that &#x2014; and good news is, the president will soon sign a new customs reform bill into law. It will likely take years, and a lot of work, for those reforms to really take effect, but it&#x2019;s a step in the right direction.

(Lisa Kukharska / The Kyiv Independent)Ukrainian drones take aim at Russia&#x2019;s energy sectorWhile Russian missiles and drones attempt to cripple Ukraine&#x2019;s economy and will by targeting its vital energy system, Ukraine&#x2019;s military is hitting back with its own attacks on Russia&#x2019;s oil refining capabilities. Since the start of the year, Ukrainian drones have hit around 33 oil assets, mostly refineries, in Russia, OSINT group Liveuamap told the Kyiv Independent. The viral videos of drones slamming into refineries have boosted morale in Ukraine and undermined the Kremlin. But the tangible impact may not be as great as Ukraine initially hoped.

Ukraine&#x2019;s largest steel plant, located in the city of Kryvyi Rih, said that it is facing reduced levels of production and has lowered its forecast, citing a drop in global prices for iron ore, slowing steel markets in Europe, and the high cost of electricity in Ukraine, as well as frequent blackouts brought on by Russian attacks. Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter, about one-third of the expected peak demand, International Energy Agency head Fatih Birol told FT. &quot;It&apos;s time for everybody to understand that this winter could be consequential in Ukraine,&quot; Birol said.

No Russian troops on Vuhledar outskirts, governor claims	Russian troops have not yet reached the outskirts of the embattled town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said on Sept. 25. &quot;There is no enemy on the outskirts of the town yet. Sabotage and reconnaissance groups are coming in, but our defenders are trying to knock them out. This means that the town is not yet captured,&quot; he said on national television. &quot;Our defenders are doing everything possible and impossible. They burned a lot of enemy equipment.&quot; The front-line town lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The 72nd Mechanized Brigade has defended Vuhledar for nearly two years, as Russian forces have been trying to capture the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Filashkin said Russian forces are trying to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense line near Vuhledar and &quot;are advancing.&quot; According to the crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState, Russian forces are aiming to encircle the town. Estimated Russian advance in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Sept. 25, 2024. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Around 100 people remain in Vuhledar refusing to leave, Filashkin added. Andrii Kovalenko, head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, said on Sept. 24 that Russia has devastated the town of Vuhledar and is attempting to advance from the flanks. Vuhledar has withstood numerous attacks since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022 and has become key to Ukrainian defenses in the southern part of Donetsk Oblast. &quot;The loss of Vuhledar would be not only a morale blow for Ukraine since this city has resisted plenty of assaults since 2022, but also a very serious development that can potentially threaten the security of the entire southwestern portion of Donetsk Oblast not yet occupied, along with the threat to Pokrovsk&apos;s southern flank,&quot; Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent earlier this month.	https://kyivindependent.com/no-russian-troops-on-vuhledar-outskirts-governor-claims/	2024-09-25T06:11:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1770373976.jpg
Zelensky meets with NATO's Stoltenberg in New York	President Volodymyr Zelensky met with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in New York on Sept. 25, thanking him for &quot;supporting Ukraine throughout his tenure.&quot; In a post on social media, Zelensky said the pair discussed several issues, including &quot;the need to enhance Ukraine&apos;s air defense, (and) the continued efforts on an invitation for our state to join NATO as soon as possible.&quot; Stoltenberg is stepping down as NATO Secretary General next month. Former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte will take his place. Zelensky is in the U.S. this week where is expected to present his victory plan to U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House on Sept. 26. An invitation to join NATO is part of the plan, the head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak said on Sept. 24. Ukraine applied for NATO membership in September 2022, half a year into Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.

Biden said that peace in Ukraine means a guarantee that Russia will never occupy the country again, but Kyiv&apos;s membership in NATO is not necessary for this. According to Zelensky, who has repeatedly called on partners to issue a membership invitation to Kyiv, Ukraine will join NATO only after Russia&apos;s full-scale war ends.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-with-natos-stoltenberg-in-new-york/	2024-09-25T05:48:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2161907479.jpg
Military intelligence reveals details of operation to recapture Vovchansk aggregate plant	Ukrainian forces captured around 24 Russian soldiers and killed &quot;several dozen&quot; others during an operation to recapture an aggregate plant in the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, a member of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) claimed on Sept. 25. Speaking to national television, a HUR special forces officer with the call sign Viking revealed details of the operation, adding a further four Russian soldiers &quot;tried to leave the plant and were neutralized outside the perimeter.&quot; &quot;The battle lasted a little over a week. There was intense shelling from the enemy. The enemy at the factory put up a lot of resistance, but in the end we completed the task,&quot; he said. Russian troops had been in control of the Vovchansk plant for several months before the facility was recaptured on Sept. 24., HUR previously reported. &quot;The plant is destroyed and damaged. But it is possible to maintain a defense there,&quot; Viking said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. HUR Chief Kyrylo Budanov was briefed on the &quot;successful completion of the operation,&quot; HUR said in a statement on Sept. 24, adding the &quot;extremely difficult&quot; attack was carried out by the agency&apos;s special forces. &quot;The fighters of HUR carried out a systematic sweep of the plant&apos;s buildings, constantly engaging in contact battles with the enemy in densely built-up conditions. In some cases, Ukrainian special forces engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy,&quot; it claimed. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces took the territory of the aggregate plant under control after all 30 buildings were cleared (of Russian forces).&quot; Vovchansk is an embattled town some 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Kharkiv that has seen heavy battles since Russia launched a new offensive in the area in May. While initially gaining ground, the Russian offensive in northern Kharkiv Oblast has quickly bogged down, with Russian troops reportedly suffering heavy losses. The intensity of fighting has decreased somewhat compared to other sectors in Ukraine&apos;s east near Pokrovsk, Vuhledar and Toretsk.	https://kyivindependent.com/vovchansk-aggregate-plant-recaptured-hur/	2024-09-25T04:52:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/--------------2024-09-25-141806.png
Russia establishes secret attack drone programme in China, Reuters reports	Russia has secretly established a development and production programme in China for attack drones to be used in the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported on Sept. 25 citing European intelligence sources and documents reviewed by the outlet. According to the report, Russia has flight-tested a new drone called the Garpiya-3 (G3) in China with the help of local specialists. Details of the project were revealed in a report by the company behind the project, IEMZ Kupol, a subsidiary of the Kremlin-owned weapons company Almaz-Antey. China has positioned itself as neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war but has simultaneously deepened economic ties with Moscow and backed the country against Western sanctions. Beijing has also emerged as one of Russia&apos;s leading sources of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry. In a comment to Reuters, China&apos;s foreign ministry denied knowledge of the G3 project. In an interview with ABC News aired on Sept. 24., President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is using Chinese satellites to take pictures of Ukraine&apos;s nuclear facilities for possible future attacks. &quot;The recent information is that Russia has been using Chinese satellites and taking photos of the details of the objects on nuclear facilities,&quot; the president said. &quot;And in our experience, if Russia takes photos of certain objects, then there is a threat of strikes against the nuclear objects.&quot; He did not elaborate on whether Chinese satellites were commercial or controlled by the Chinese government.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-establishes-secret-attack-drone-programme-in-china-reuters-reports/	2024-09-25T04:18:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172181156.jpg
Ukraine has 'extensive' 3-year plan for drone, ground robotics production, defense minister says	Ukraine has developed a three-year plan for the production of drones, electronic warfare equipment and ground robotic systems, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said in an interview with Lb.ua media outlet published on Sept. 24. Described as &quot;very thorough and extensive,&quot; the document on Ukrainian manufacturing was presented during Umerov&apos;s recent trips to the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, as well as at the Ramstein meeting earlier this month. &quot;We looked at how many of them (drones, electronic warfare, ground robotic systems) we needed and how we would use them at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels,&quot; the minister said. The plan also includes the specific number of weapons that Ukraine can produce and the funds needed, Umerov added without elaborating. &quot;There are already several countries today that have agreed to finance our drones and missiles,&quot; Umerov added. The Ukrainian military has proven to be a pioneer in drone technology, using innovative ways to undermine Russia&apos;s ammunition and personnel advantage. According to Umerov, Ukraine has destroyed or damaged over 200 military facilities in Russia over the past year using &quot;drone swarm&quot; technology. Kyiv says it uses domestically-produced drones to hit targets on Russian soil amid ongoing pressure on its partners to lift restrictions on deep strikes with Western-supplied weapons. Kyiv has the production capacity to produce more than 3 million drones a year but requires financing from foreign partners, Deputy Strategic Industries Minister Hanna Hvozdiar said in July.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-has-3-year-plan/	2024-09-25T03:18:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168760161.jpg
Lula pushes China-Brazil 6-point peace plan at UN, already dismissed by Ukraine as 'destructive'	Brazil&apos;s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva touted his peace plan jointly developed with China at the U.N. General Assembly on Sept. 24, despite the proposal already being dismissed as &quot;destructive&quot; by Ukraine. Condemning the &quot;invasion of Ukrainian territory,&quot; Lula said it was now &quot;crucial&quot; to create the conditions needed for peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow. &quot;This is the message of the six-point understanding that China and Brazil are offering to establish a process of dialogue and an end to hostilities,&quot; he added. China and Brazil first put forward the plan in May, setting it up as an alternative to Ukraine&apos;s own efforts of initiating peace negotiations and ending Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The timing of the proposal, not to mention China and Brazil&apos;s friendly stances towards Russia, have called into question what their vision of peace would actually mean for Ukraine. According to Reuters, Lula&apos;s foreign policy adviser Celso Amorim will meet with representatives of 20 countries in New York on Friday in an effort to garner support. The outlet said Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates are among those who have been invited, but Ukraine&apos;s staunchest allies would not attend. The six-point plan, proposed by China and Brazil, refers to the war as a &quot;crisis&quot; and calls for: It makes no mention of Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity or the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. China and Brazil proposed and prompted the plan in parallel to Ukraine&apos;s ongoing peace efforts based on Zelensky&apos;s 10-point peace formula. Zelensky&#x2019;s plan calls for a complete withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine, punishing those responsible for war crimes, and the release of all prisoners, among other goals. A major part of the push for Ukraine&apos;s plan was a global peace summit in Switzerland in June. China did not attend the summit despite an invitation, while the Brazilian representative who was present did not sign the resulting communique. In an interview with Brazilian outlet Metropoles published on Sept. 12, Zelensky was scathing about the six-point plan, describing it as &quot;destructive.&quot; &quot;You either support the war, or you don&apos;t support the war. If you don&apos;t support it, then help us stop Russia,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;(Should we) just give up our land, forget that they are killing our people? &quot;What is the compromise in that? That&apos;s why I think it&apos;s destructive. It&apos;s just a political statement.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/lula-pushes-china-brazil-6-point-peace-plan-at-un-already-dismissed-by-ukraine-as-destructive/	2024-09-25T02:34:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173393786.jpg
Iran mediating secret talks to send Russian anti-ship missiles to Yemen's Houthis, Reuters reports	Iran is brokering secret negotiations between Russia and Yemen&apos;s Houthis to transfer Yakhont supersonic anti-ship missiles to them, Reuters reported on Sept. 24, citing seven unnamed sources. Representatives of the Iran-backed Houthi group and Moscow met in Tehran at least twice in 2024, two officials familiar with the matter told Reuters. The talks on the supply of &quot;dozens&quot; of missiles are ongoing, and new meetings in Tehran are expected in the coming weeks, the news agency reported. The Houthis are an Iran-backed militant group located in Yemen. Following Israel&apos;s invasion of Gaza, the Houthis began launching attacks against shipping vessels in the Red Sea. &quot;The Iranians are brokering the talks but do not want to have their signature over it,&quot; a Western intelligence source said. The Kremlin has reportedly not yet made a final decision on deliveries of the Yakhont missiles, also known as P-800 Oniks, which have a range of about 300 kilometers. Experts believe that such a move will allow the militant group to attack commercial vessels more precisely and increase the threat to the U.S. and European warships defending them, according to Reuters. Russia and Iran have deepened their military and political cooperation since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Tehran has provided Moscow with thousands of Shahed kamikaze drones used in attacks against Ukraine. After months of contradictory reports, the U.S. on Sept. 10 confirmed that Iran had delivered ballistic missiles to Russia in what could prove a dramatic development for Ukraine. To date, no Iranian ballistic missiles are known to have been fired at Ukraine by Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 11 at the Crimean Platform in Kyiv, attended by a Kyiv Independent reporter. But with larger warheads and being far more difficult to intercept, they pose a much greater threat than Shaheds. In a statement on Sept. 7, Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry said the move &quot;will have devastating consequences for Ukrainian-Iranian bilateral relations.&quot; Ukraine, European Union, and the U.S. have recently introduced more sanctions against Tehran in the wake of the confirmation of the ballistic missile delivery to Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/iran/	2024-09-25T02:09:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172431775.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill at least 11, injure 69 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed at least 11 people and injured 69 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Sept. 25. Ukrainian forces downed 28 out of 32 Shahed-type drones and all four Kh-59/69 cruise missiles launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Four more drones were &quot;lost&quot; in a few regions, it added. Russian forces struck Kharkiv, Ukraine&apos;s second-largest city, killing at least three people and injuring 36 others, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Russia attacked the city with guided aerial bombs, targeting densely populated districts, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. Four districts in the city were attacked, with residential high-rise buildings damaged in the Kyivskyi and Saltivskyi districts. One suffered a direct hit. The number of casualties may increase as the rescue operation is still ongoing. Military personnel look at the destroyed house following a Russian attack on the city of Kharkiv on Sept. 24, 2024.

Russian forces also attacked the village of Varvarivka with a first-person-view (FPV) drone, killing a 61-year-old man, Syniehubov said. Two more people were injured. A Russian overnight attack on the city of Zaporizhzhia injured at least seven people, according to Governor Ivan Fedorov. A 55-year-old man was killed in a Russian attack near the town of Polohy in the region. Russian attacks on the Nova Sloboda community in Sumy Oblast killed a civilian, local authorities reported. One person was killed in the town of Kostiantynivka and two others in the town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. A total of five people suffered injuries in the region over the past day, he added. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 20 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. One person was killed and 18 were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-injure-over-past-day/	2024-09-25T01:19:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173419948.jpg
Russia preparing to attack 3 nuclear plants in Ukraine, Zelensky tells UN	Russia is preparing to target three Ukrainian nuclear power plants, President Volodymyr Zelensky told the U.N. Security Council in New York on Sept. 24. &quot;If Russia is ready to go that far, it means nothing you value matters to Moscow. This kind of Russian cynicism will keep striking if it&#x2019;s given any room in the world,&quot; he said. Zelensky did not specify which stations are under threat, but said Kyiv had evidence and &quot;proof&quot; of Russia&apos;s plans. There are three operating nuclear power plants on the Ukrainian-held territory &#x2014; Rivne and Khmelnytskyi NPPs in the country&apos;s west, and Pivdennoukrainsk NPP in the south. Russia&apos;s regular attacks put their safety in jeopardy by cutting off power to the units. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe&apos;s largest nuclear power station, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. Throughout its occupation, the plant has been repeatedly disconnected from the Ukrainian power grid due to Russian attacks on the country&apos;s energy infrastructure. There have been mounting warnings from Kyiv in recent days about such attacks. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Sept. 21 that Russia&apos;s possible targets include open distribution devices at nuclear power plants (NPP) and transmission substations &quot;which are essential for the safe functioning of the nuclear energy system.&quot; Earlier on Sept. 24, Zelensky said that Russia is using Chinese satellites to take pictures of Ukraine&apos;s nuclear facilities for possible future attacks. Ukraine&apos;s special services informed Kyiv&apos;s partners and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) about the threat.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-preparing-to-attack-3-ukraines-nuclear-plants-zelensky-says/	2024-09-24T23:55:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173438114.jpg
Ukraine responds after Czech president's 'temporary Russian occupation' comments	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry on Sept. 24 reiterated that the full withdrawal of Russian troops from all occupied territories is necessary for a &quot;just and lasting peace,&quot; after the president of Czechia said Kyiv should be &quot;realistic&quot; about achieving such a goal. In an interview with The New York Times (NYT) published on Sept. 23, Petr Pavel said the &quot;temporary&quot; occupation of some Ukrainian territories by Russia is the most likely outcome of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion. &quot;To talk about a defeat of Ukraine or defeat of Russia, it will simply not happen. So the end will be somewhere in between,&quot; he said, adding Kyiv needed to be &quot;realistic.&quot; In a statement on its website that didn&apos;t mention Pavel by name, Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry said there can be &quot;no middle-ground solutions,&quot; and the full withdrawal of Russian troops was &quot;a realistic scenario.&quot; &quot;The withdrawal of Russian occupying forces from the sovereign territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders is one of the mandatory points of President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s Peace Formula,&quot; it added. &quot;This and other provisions of the Formula will guarantee a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace not only for Ukraine, but for the entire European continent and the world.&quot; As of late August, Russia was in control of around 27% of Ukrainian territory, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said. Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts are partially controlled by Russian troops. Russia claims to have annexed the whole territory of those regions despite not controlling two regional capitals &#x2014; Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. &#xA0;Moscow also controls all of Ukraine&apos;s Crimean peninsula. Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the illegal annexation of four oblasts in September 2022, and in June called for Ukrainian troops to leave these territories as a condition for peace negotiations, a proposal which was rejected by Ukraine. Pavel later on Sept. 24 responded to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry statement, saying he had previously &quot;warned against unrealistic expectations.&quot; &quot;I have never questioned that we should support Ukraine in restoring its territorial integrity, that this is the ultimate goal. We just have to be realistic about the time horizon and the cost of achieving that goal,&quot; he told journalists in New York. &quot;Defeating Russia in Ukraine at the cost of killing half the Ukrainian population is probably not a victory.&quot; Ukraine says peace talks should be held on the basis of its 10-step peace formula, which includes a full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. Zelensky is also expected to present his &quot;victory plan&quot; to President Joe Biden during his ongoing visit to the U.S. this week. &quot;There is not and cannot be any alternative to peace, no freezing of the war or any other manipulations that will simply move Russian aggression to another stage,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address on Sept. 18.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-responds-after-czech-presidents-temporary-russian-occupation-comments/	2024-09-24T23:23:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2160820762.jpg
No Zelensky-Trump meeting scheduled in US this week, AP reports	No meetings have been scheduled between former U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky this week, the Associated Press (AP) reported on Sept. 25, citing an unnamed official on Trump&#x2019;s campaign. As Zelensky&apos;s visit to the U.S. continues, he is expected to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden to present a victory plan at the White House on Sept. 26. It was also reported that he planned to discuss it with presidential candidates Trump and Kamala Harris. Last week, Ukraine&apos;s president said that he would most likely meet with Trump on Sept. 26-27, without providing further details. &quot;The main thing is to have time. I will not look into the future, but I think it will be important for both of us,&quot; Zelensky told journalists. But according to the official cited by AP, no meeting has yet been scheduled between Trump and Zelensky. Kyiv has not commented on AP&apos;s reports. Trump&apos;s possible return to the White House is causing concern in Ukraine. The pro-Trump wing of the Republican Party blocked the U.S. aid bill in Congress for months earlier this year, which proved detrimental to the situation on the Ukrainian battlefields and contributed to the loss of a key city of Avdiivka. Statements and rumors coming from Trump&apos;s inner circle also suggest he might seek to pressure Ukraine to cede territory or give up its NATO aspirations to achieve a quicker resolution of the war. The former president has repeatedly said he would end the war within &quot;24 hours if reelected&quot; and evaded a question about whether he wants Ukraine to win during a recent debate with Harris. In his recent remarks, Trump criticized America&apos;s involvement in the war in Ukraine, saying the country is &quot;stuck&quot; and will only be able to &quot;get out&quot; if he wins the election. Zelensky and Trump held the first in five years call in July. According to Ukraine&apos;s president, Trump told him he is &quot;very supportive,&quot; and would do &quot;everything to strengthen Ukraine&quot; if elected president.	https://kyivindependent.com/no-zelensky-trump-meetings-scheduled-in-us-this-week-ap-reports/	2024-09-24T23:06:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170591813.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 646,400 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 646,400 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Sept. 25. This number includes 1,250 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 8,815 tanks, 17,304 armored fighting vehicles, 25,248 vehicles and fuel tanks, 18,549 artillery systems, 1,199 multiple launch rocket systems, 952 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 328 helicopters, 15,879 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-646-400-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-09-24T22:18:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2164069605-1.jpg
Zelensky says Russia can't be calmed by talks alone	President Volodymyr Zelensky told the U.N. Security Council on Sept. 24 that peace cannot be achieved through negotiations alone, but that Russia must be forced to end the war. Zelensky has been rallying support from Western leaders for his &quot;victory plan&quot; to bring an end to the war, which began when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. He emphasized that the war will eventually conclude, but not because &quot;someone got tired of the war&quot; or through a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, rejecting proposals to cede Ukrainian territory as a means to resolve the conflict. &quot;This war can&apos;t be calmed by talks. Action is needed,&quot; Zelensky said, thanking nations that have supported Ukraine. &quot;Putin has violated so many international norms and rules that he won&apos;t stop on his own. Russia can only be forced into peace, and that is exactly what&apos;s needed&#x2014;forcing Russia into peace, as the sole aggressor in this war, the sole violator of the U.N. Charter.&quot; Zelensky also condemned North Korea and Iran for supplying weapons to Russia, calling them &quot;de facto accomplices&quot; of Moscow. Zelensky believes that if his strategy gains Western backing, it could exert significant pressure on Moscow, potentially influencing Putin to seek a diplomatic end to the conflict. While he&apos;s shared few specifics about the &quot;victory plan,&quot; Zelensky has indicated that it would pave the way for a second Ukraine-led peace summit, which Kyiv intends to host later this year and invite Russia to attend. Russia has recently announced it will not participate in any future iterations of the Swiss-hosted peace summit. During the U.N. Security Council meeting, Russia&#x2019;s Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia criticized the inclusion of Zelensky, dismissing the focus on Ukraine. &quot;Western countries could not refrain from poisoning the atmosphere once again, trying to fill the air time with the hackneyed Ukrainian issue,&quot; Nebenzia was quoted as saying.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-says-russia-cant-be-calmed-by-talks-alone/	2024-09-24T21:30:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173251936.jpg
UK's Lammy aims to secure strongest support for Ukraine	U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said on Sept. 24 that he is working to ensure Ukraine is in the &quot;strongest position&quot; in its war against Russia ahead of the winter months. While Lammy refrained from confirming whether the U.K. would authorize Ukraine to use British long-range precision weapons to strike inside Russia, he acknowledged that Iran&apos;s supply of ballistic missiles to Moscow has marked a &quot;major escalation.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky has long requested permission to use British Storm Shadow missiles and U.S.-made ATACMS to hit targets deeper within Russia. However, U.S. President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer postponed a decision during their meeting on Sept. 13. Lammy, speaking in New York at the U.N. General Assembly, said he didn&#x2019;t want to grant Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;any operational advantage,&quot; but emphasized that &quot;the most important thing is to put Ukraine in the strongest position&quot; as winter approaches, AFP reported. The U.K. has consistently voiced strong support for Ukraine and has pledged a total of &#xA3;12.8 billion (approximately $16.2 billion) in support for Ukraine, which includes &#xA3;7.8 billion (around $9.9 billion) allocated for military assistance and &#xA3;5 billion (approximately $6.3 billion) designated for non-military support. Lammy&#x2019;s remarks followed his speech at the U.N. Security Council, where he criticized Russia&#x2019;s actions, accusing Moscow of violating international law and targeting civilian infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/uks-lammy-aims-to-secure-strongest-support-for-ukraine/	2024-09-24T18:50:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170653139.jpg
Trump vows to 'get America out' of Ukraine war, blames Biden for conflict	At a rally in Atlanta on Sept. 24, U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump criticized America&apos;s involvement in the war in Ukraine, saying the country is &quot;stuck&quot; and will only be able to &quot;get out&quot; if he wins the election. Trump claimed that &quot;Biden and Kamala (Harris) got us into this war in Ukraine, and now they can&apos;t get us out,&quot; while promising to &quot;settle the war in Ukraine&quot; if elected. &quot;But we&apos;re stuck in that war unless I&apos;m president. I&#x2019;ll get it done. I&#x2019;ll get it negotiated. I&#x2019;ll get out. We gotta get out,&quot; Trump said. He also described President Volodymyr Zelensky as &quot;the greatest salesman on Earth,&quot; alleging that each of Zelensky&apos;s visits to the U.S. results in receiving &quot;a hundred billion.&quot; Trump&apos;s possible return to the White House is causing concern in Ukraine. The pro-Trump wing of the Republican Party blocked the U.S. aid bill in Congress for months earlier this year, which proved detrimental to the situation on the Ukrainian battlefields and contributed to the loss of a key city of Avdiivka.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-vows-to-get-america-out-of-ukraine-war-blames-biden-for-conflict/	2024-09-24T17:46:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170263973.jpg
Small percentage of artillery shells from Czech-led initiative malfunction	A few issues have been reported with some of the artillery shells received through the Czech initiative, according to German publication Handelsblatt, which cited a letter from Kyiv to Prague. Czechia unveiled the international initiative earlier this year amid Ukraine&apos;s shell shortages caused largely by delays in U.S. assistance. Through the initiative, Prague had identified 500,000 155 mm shells and 300,000 122 mm shells outside Europe that could be bought and sent to Ukraine after the necessary funds were allocated to the initiative. A small portion of the received shells have exploded prematurely during combat, leading to injuries and damage to artillery systems. Approximately 0.05% of nearly 35,000 artillery shells had this issue, with five out of every 10,000 breaking prematurely. According to Ukrainian officials, the malfunctions were due to older detonators from World War II, resulting in &quot;numerous explosions at a distance of 20 to 60 meters from the muzzle.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously expressed gratitude for Czech President Petr Pavel&#x2019;s initiative and support. Czechia&#x2019;s support for Ukraine has gone beyond artillery ammunition. The country was the first one to provide main battle tanks to Ukraine, in addition to helicopters, multiple rocket launchers, armored vehicles, and more.	https://kyivindependent.com/small-percentage-of-artillery-shells-from-czech-led-initiative-malfunction/	2024-09-24T14:56:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2163779496.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Fighting for Vovchansk continues, Kyiv restores control over aggregate plant	Key developments on Sept. 24: Ukrainian forces recaptured an aggregate plant in the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Sept. 24. HUR Chief Kyrylo Budanov was briefed on the &quot;successful completion of the operation&quot; earlier in the day, the agency said in a statement, adding the &quot;extremely difficult&quot; attack was carried out by HUR special forces. &quot;The fighters of HUR carried out a systematic sweep of the plant&apos;s buildings, constantly engaging in battles with the enemy in densely urbanized conditions,&quot; it added. Vovchansk is an embattled town some 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Kharkiv that has seen heavy battles since Russia launched a new offensive in the area in May. While initially gaining ground, the Russian offensive in northern Kharkiv Oblast has quickly bogged down, with Russian troops reportedly suffering heavy losses. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces took under control the territory of the aggregate plant after all 30 buildings were cleared (of Russian forces),&quot; Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence said. During the operation, Ukrainian troops also reportedly took Russian captives. The Kyiv Independent couldn&apos;t independently verify this information. Russian troops have been in control of the Vovchansk plant for several months. During the operation, Russian soldiers attacked Ukrainian soldiers with kamikaze attack drones, guided aerial bombs, and continued intensive shelling with TOS-1 &quot;Solntsepek&quot; multiple rocket launchers. Russian forces struck Kharkiv, Ukraine&apos;s second-largest city, on Sept. 24, killing at least three and injuring 34 people, local authorities reported. Russia bombarded the city with guided aerial bombs, targeting densely populated districts, Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov reported at around 3:30 p.m. local time. Kharkiv&apos;s four districts were under attack, with residential high-rise buildings damaged in the Kyivskyi and Saltivskyi districts. Terekhov said that Russia used eight FAB-250 bombs in the attack, while Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov said that one of the strikes was carried out with a FAB-500 bomb. One of the high-rise buildings came under a direct Russian strike, according to Syniehubov. People are trapped under the rubble; emergency services are continuing search and rescue operations at the scene, Syniehubov added. The aftermath of the Russian strike at a backery in the city of Kharkiv on Sept. 24, 2024. (Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleg Syniehubov / Telegram)Terekhov said that one of the buildings, which was damaged in the Kyivskyi district, had already been attacked in the beginning of the full-scale invasion. According to the mayor, it was almost repaired, insulated, and prepared for the heating season before Russian forces struck it again. Some 82 people lived in the section of the building that suffered the most severe damage, Terekhov said. &quot;We are now trying to contact all of them to find out if people are under the rubble,&quot; he added. One of the strikes also hit a food industry enterprise, Terekhov said. The local authorities later clarified that Russia attacked a bakery plant with a FAB-500 gliding aerial bomb, killing one person and injuring eight others. The youngest victim is a 17-year-old girl, while the oldest is an 87-year-old woman. The majority of the injured are in moderate condition, with four people in serious condition. Three people are in surgery as of 6 p.m. local time, according to Syniehubov. The Kremlin will maintain record high defense spending in 2025, Bloomberg reported on Sept. 24 citing draft budget proposals seen by the outlet. With no immediate end to the war in Ukraine in sight, the Russian government will increase defense spending to 13.2 trillion rubles ($142 billion) in 2025 from a projected 10.4 trillion rubles ($111 billion) in 2024. In contrast, social spending is expected to amount to 7.7 trillion rubles ($87 billion), or 21.1% of the Russian budget in 2024. NATO countries have set a goal to spend 2 percent of the country&#x2019;s GDP on defense in 2024. Russia is spending around 6 percent. Russia is on track for an intense economic slowdown due to significant labor shortages and constraints placed on the key sectors that backed growth until now, it was reported on Aug. 9. Labor resources are practically drained while the competition between the military and business for recruits becomes more fierce. This is likely to limit the further growth of defense-related industries. The banking and construction sectors are no longer protected from the impacts of high interest rates as the government shuts down the state-subsidized mortgage programs. Despite Russia&apos;s GDP growing by 4% in the first quarter of the year, it will likely slow down to 2% in the last half of the year and hit 0.5% - 1.5% in 2025, says Alex Isakov, Russia economist at Bloomberg Economics. Most of the foreign parts found in Russian weapons used on the battlefield against Ukraine come from China, Vladyslav Vlasiuk, an adviser to Ukraine&apos;s President&apos;s Office, said on Sept. 24. China has positioned itself as neutral in the ongoing war but has deepened economic ties with Russia and became Moscow&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, fueling the Kremlin&apos;s war machine. &quot;If you take all the usual types of weapons and count the foreign made components, about 60% would be coming from China,&quot; Vlasiuk said in comments reported by Reuters, calling Beijing &quot;the biggest problem.&quot; Vlasiuk said that Kyiv held talks with some manufacturers on the issue, without providing further details. Important parts used in surveillance systems, drones and missiles also come from countries including the U.S., the Netherlands, Japan and Switzerland, he added. Despite extensive Western sanctions aimed at cutting off supply lines, Russia continues to obtain sanctioned goods, such as microchips, via third-party countries. Kyiv&apos;s allies have sought to halt the Kremlin&apos;s ability to circumvent sanctions. One of the EU&apos;s sanctions package included a ban for third-country entities to re-export sensitive goods to Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia uses dozens of critical components from abroad to produce all its missiles. Missiles launched at Kyiv in one of the spring attacks had an estimated total of 1,500 foreign parts. The &quot;temporary&quot; occupation of some Ukrainian territories by Russia is the most likely outcome of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion, Czech President Petr Pavel said in an interview published on Sept. 23. Speaking to The New York Times (NYT), Pavel said neither Ukraine nor Russia should expect to achieve outright victory. &quot;To talk about a defeat of Ukraine or defeat of Russia, it will simply not happen. So the end will be somewhere in between,&quot; he said. As of late August, Russia was in control of around 27% of Ukrainian territory, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts are partially controlled by Russian troops. Russia claims to have annexed the whole territory of those regions despite not controlling two regional capitals &#x2014; Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. &#xA0;Moscow also controls all of Ukraine&apos;s Crimean peninsula. Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the illegal annexation of four oblasts in September 2022, and in June called for Ukrainian troops to leave these territories as a condition for peace negotiations, a proposal which was rejected by Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-restores-control-over-aggregate-plant-in-kharkiv-oblasts-vovchansk-military-intelligence-says/	2024-09-24T13:20:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/--------------2024-09-24-155839.png
Despite hardships, head of Kryvyi Rih steel plant ArcelorMittal determined to keep operations running	Mauro Longobardo, CEO of ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih, addressed the company&apos;s current situation and future plans, noting both progress and significant obstacles. He acknowledged the company&apos;s recovery efforts but highlighted the challenges they continue to face in 2024, including falling iron ore prices and stagnation in the European steel market. &quot;For our survival, the company needs to achieve at least minimal financial stability,&quot; Longobardo wrote on X. He also said that over 3,000 employees are currently serving in the Ukrainian Armed Forces, with 233 colleagues either killed or missing in action during the war. Despite these hardships, Longobardo reaffirmed the company&apos;s commitment to overcoming these difficulties and sustaining operations. In the early months of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, ArcelorMittal workers were forced to shut down the plant. The company manages the ongoing power outages caused by frequent Russian attacks on energy infrastructure by using powerful diesel generators and rotating electricity between different parts of the plant.	https://kyivindependent.com/despite-hardships-head-of-kryvyi-rih-steel-plant-arcelormittal-determined-to-keep-operations-running/	2024-09-24T13:16:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/Metal-Factory-v2_00_00_09_00_Still043.png

It was the second attempt after the previous rejection of the bill in the parliament and its revision by the Tax Committee. The draft law suggests the record high increase of taxes to ensure additional budget revenues of Hr 58 billion ($1.4 billion) till the end of 2024 and Hr 137 billion ($3.3 billion) in 2025. As we reported earlier, the revised version has only one update which raises the bank profit tax rate up to 50%. Lawmakers have two weeks to submit amendments to the draft law, so it can be considered the second reading not earlier than in mid-October. It means that the provision of the draft law may be applied retroactively as the text suggests they should come into effect from Oct. 1. The Verkhovna Rada adopted the draft law with amendments to the State Budget 2024. Last week, the parliament voted for draft law #11417 on increasing defense spending by Hr 500 billion ($12 billion) in the final reading. Thus, in 2024 Ukraine will have the record high budget spending of Hr 3.73 trillion ($90 billion). The Verkhovna Rada supported in the first reading the Accounting Chamber reform. The Parliament adopted in the first reading draft law #10044-d on the reform of the Accounting Chamber. The draft law suggests establishing a transparent competitive selection of the ACU&#x2019;s members with participation and the decisive vote of international experts, extending the mandate of the Accounting Chamber to all public finances, strengthening its independence, reducing a number of the ACU&#x2019;s members from 13 to 11, and introducing external audit with experts with international auditing experience. Last week the parliament adopted four draft laws from the World Bank requirements. During the parliamentary meetings scheduled for Sept. 17-18, the Verkhovna Rada adopted four draft laws in the final reading and one draft law in the first reading which Ukraine was obliged to adopt within the agreements with the World Bank. The Parliament adopted in the final reading draft law #5819 on regulating rating agencies and #11474 to address the issue of privatization of the state banks which will be sold transparently via Prozorro.Sale platform. Moreover, the Verkhovna Rada fully adopted draft law #11063-d on the State Agrarian Register and #10143 with the amendments to the Bankruptcy Code which are also obligations to the EU under the Ukraine Plan of Ukraine Facility. Furthermore, the Verkhovna Rada adopted in the first reading the new draft law #11520 on public procurements. Me and my colleagues are preparing several proposals to the draft law in the second reading regarding closing abuses currently allowed by exceptions to the law. Ukraine unlocked large-scale privatization. Hotel &quot;Ukraina&#x201D;in Kyiv was sold in an auction for Hr 2.5 billion (approx $60 million) via online platform Prozorro.Sale. It&apos;s the first case of large-scale privatization after it was allowed by law. During the auction the price increased 2.5 times from the starting price. The Verkhovna Rada obliged SOEs to publish detailed prices of procurements for construction works. The Parliament adopted in the final reading the draft law #11057 on changes in public procurement procedures for the SOEs and required from the state contracting authorities to publish the detailed cost estimate of construction works under the signed contracts. As we reported in Issue 48, currently several provisions, including those adopted due to the martial law, give the SOEs a right not to show the detailed cost estimate within the procurements related to construction works which leads to abuse of the provision by SOEs. The Cabinet of Ministers presented the 2025 state budget in the parliament. On Sept. 20, Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko presented the 2025 Draft Budget to the Verkhovna Rada according to the budget process procedure in Ukraine. Lawmakers will submit their amendments by Oct. 1 and the parliament has to vote for the draft law on the State Budget for 2025 for the first time not later than Oct. 20.	https://kyivindependent.com/mp-yaroslav-zhelezniak-developments-in-ukraines-parliament-on-economic-reforms-international-obligations-issue-74/	2024-09-24T13:13:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1245855806.webp
Russian troops aim to encircle Vuhledar, Ukraine's last fortress in southern Donbas	The long-embattled town of Vuhledar, key to Ukrainian defenses in the southeastern part of Donetsk Oblast, is under threat of encirclement and is being &quot;razed to the ground,&quot; according to reports on Sept. 24. Located 50 kilometers south of Pokrovsk, the strategic roadway junction, Vuhledar is often called a &quot;fortress&quot; among the military. The town is now at the epicenter of a Russian months-long push. The loss of Vuhledar would pose a threat to the southern flank of Pokrovsk, another city Ukraine is struggling to hold amid continuous Russian assaults. In recent days, Russian troops appear to have dramatically stepped up the assault, and information from Russian pro-war military bloggers and open-source monitors suggests Ukrainian forces are at risk of Russian encirclement. &quot;Russian units have entered Vuhledar &#x2013; the storming of the town has begun,&quot; the &#xA0;Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger Yuri Podolyaka said in a post on Telegram on Sept. 23. In a Sept. 24 update, the crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState said Russian forces were &quot;simply razing it to the ground&quot; with artillery and guided bombs. A video accompanying the post purportedly showed multiple explosions in an unidentified part of the town. The latest map from DeepState shows Russian forces attacking the town directly as well as on both of its flanks. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, in its morning update on Sept. 24, said there were &quot;eight attempts to seize our positions&quot; in the area but did not provide any further details. The Kyiv Independent reached out to Ukraine&apos;s military for information on the situation in Vuhledar, but it declined to respond. &quot;I would be surprised if the battle goes on for much longer,&quot; Emil Kastehelmi, an analyst at the Finland-based Black Bird Group, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;I think we are seeing the end times of Vuhledar as we speak.&quot; According to Ukrainian government statistics, Vuhledar was home to 14,000 people on the eve of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. By February 2024, around 100 people were left in Vuhledar, mostly pensioners living in basements. The city is now practically depopulated and destroyed. Despite that, the loss of Vuhledar, a town that has resisted Russian occupation for years, would be a serious blow to Ukrainian morale. &quot;Potentially (its loss could) threaten the security of the entire southwestern portion of Donetsk Oblast not yet occupied,&quot; Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent earlier in September. Vuhledar is located north of a key intersection connecting the O-0532 road towards Vodiane and Kostiantynivka, a small paved road toward Kurakhove, and the partly occupied T-0509 highway toward Velyka Novosilka. &quot;It is, therefore, a key logistic point for Ukrainian forces defending the southern flank of Kurakhove,&quot; Borsari said. Given the Russian significant advance towards Pokrovsk from the east in recent weeks, Ukrainian forces need to avoid a similar development from the south to avoid the risk of encirclement, Borsari added. Vuhledar is also the last fortified town before the village of Velyka Novosilka and the entire southern part of Donetsk Oblast that Ukraine controls. The occupied section of the T-0509 highway, which passes south of Vuhledar, is essential for Russian forces trying to advance westward.

(Libkos/Getty Images)Russia has long said that its goal is to occupy Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk Oblast, and Vuhledar was one of the towns that had long been standing in the way of this, Dmytro Zhmaylo, co-founder and executive director of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center, told the Kyiv Independent earlier this month. &quot;Ideological requirements, as well as information and psychological ones, often dictate military objectives for the Russians,&quot; Zhmaylo said. Vuhledar and its surroundings are heavily urbanized and lie on higher ground, making the territory a challenge to seize. Russia has suffered high losses in its attempt to take the town since the start of the full-scale invasion. Hundreds of troops from Russia&apos;s 155th Guards Naval Infantry Brigade, an elite naval infantry unit, were reportedly killed in their attempts to take the town in January and February 2023. Almost all Russian soldiers in the 5,000-strong brigade were killed, injured, or captured, the Ukrainian military said. As battles continued into March, the New York Times reported that Ukrainian forces destroyed at least 130 tanks and armored personnel carriers near Vuhledar. Ukrainian officials said this was the &quot;biggest tank battle of the war so far and a stinging setback for the Russians.&quot; In June 2024, Russian troops attempted to launch an assault on Vuhledar using not just tanks and infantry fighting vehicles but also dirt bikes, presumably to maneuver quickly on difficult terrain. Ukraine&apos;s 72nd Mechanized Brigade defended against the attack and claimed to have destroyed 16 tanks, 34 fighting vehicles, and 19 bikes.

(Wolfgang Schwan/Anadolu via Getty Images)In early September, however, Russian troops made a number of advances not far from Vuhledar. Russian troops made gains near the settlements of Hirnyk and Ukrainsk, approaching Kurakhove from the north, and managed to occupy the village of Prechystivka, 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) southwest of Vuhledar. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Sept. 10 that its forces had captured the village of Vodiane, just 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) to the northeast of Vuhledar. As Russia&apos;s advance continued in the following days, Russian pro-war military bloggers alleged that Russian troops had captured a mine just west of Vodiane. Russian commanders appear to have learned from previous failed attempts to attack Vuhledar directly, Kastehelmi said. Instead of direct mechanized assaults, Russian troops are now attacking from the flanks, something that is &quot;basic military logic,&quot; Kastehelmi said. The most serious issue is whether the Ukrainian flanks can hold. &quot;Right now, the Russians are less than 5 kilometers away from the main supply road, so there&apos;s less than a 10-kilometer gap between the Russian spearheads,&quot; Kastehelmi added. &quot;It&apos;s not a huge deal if the Russians manage to occupy a few high-rise buildings, but if they are able to seriously form an encirclement from the flanks, then that&apos;s a real issue.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/what-the-fall-of-vuhledar-would-mean-for-russias-war-in-ukraine/	2024-09-24T12:53:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1767720267-1.jpg
Russia continues construction of naval base in occupied Abkhazia, Ukraine hints it will be legitimate target	Last October, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine would strike Russia&apos;s Black Sea Fleet wherever it will be stationed &#x2014; implying that could also include occupied parts of Georgia, where Russia has kept a garrison and is rumored to be constructing a naval base. &quot;We will reach them everywhere,&quot; the president said back then. The remarks sent waves across Georgia, raising fears that the war could soon touch Georgia, which has gone a long way to distance itself from Ukraine and its fight. Since then, Russia only sped up the construction of the base, which has the potential to drag the small South Caucasian country into a wider conflict. As Russia&apos;s Black Sea Fleet, which has traditionally been stationed in occupied Crimea, has been hammered by Ukrainian attacks and largely forced to withdraw, Russia has sought a safe harbor further from Ukrainian drones and missiles. Ochamchire, located over 700 kilometers southeast of the closest Ukrainian-controlled territory, has the potential to offer Moscow a new naval base largely out of reach from much of Ukraine&apos;s current long-range capabilities. Details about the Ochamchire base, located in Abkhazia and occupied by Russia and its proxy forces since the 1990s, have been scant. Much of the analysis about the port has stemmed from satellite imagery and often contradictory statements from Abkhaz officials. Nonetheless, the project &#x2014; if completed to its full potential &#x2014; could have significant implications for Ukraine, Russia, and Georgia. Talks on the creation of a Russian naval base in Abkhazia date back long before the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Modern day Abkhazia is internationally recognized as Georgian territory, but has been under the rule of Abkhaz and Russian proxy officials since the 1990s. The first Russian warships reportedly were deployed to Ochamchire in 2009, shortly after the 2008 Russian invasion of Georgia and the subsequent cementing of the occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

(Andrei Smirnov / AFP via Getty Images)Russia officially claims that Abkhazia is an independent country, currently recognized by four other states Venezuela, Nicaragua, Syria, and Nauru. The occupied region shares a land border with Russia and is fully dependent politically and economically on Moscow. The plans to move part of Russia&apos;s Black Sea Fleet to Abkhazia gathered steam in the fall of 2023. Abkhaz proxy leader Aslan Bzhania told the Russian media outlet Izvestiya in October 2023 that Abkhazia had &quot;signed an agreement (with Russia) and, in the near future, there will be a permanent base for the Russian Navy in the Ochamchire district.&quot; No specifics of the proposed plan nor a timeline were added. Soon after, Vadym Skibitskyi, the deputy head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), claimed that construction on the port had begun, saying that &quot;Russians have carried out dredging work there&quot; and that &quot;they have reconstructed the port infrastructure in some parts in order to ensure the basing of warships there.&quot; Despite the alarming nature of the proposition, the port, as viewed from satellite imagery, is still small and does not have the deepwater capacity to serve as a significant naval base &#x2014; much less than the existing ports in Novorossiysk or in Sevastopol, occupied Crimea. Nonetheless, subsequent investigations by Bellingcat and other outlets earlier in 2024 indicate that the construction had &quot;accelerated.&quot; While satellite imagery does reveal works on the port and the construction of new infrastructure from the previous year &#x2014; such as new buildings and forest clearing &#x2014; the actual dredging required to establish a deepwater naval base was not immediately clear. Bellingcat acknowledged that &quot;information has been scarce about Russia&apos;s plans for the naval base in Ochamchire. While satellite images show that there is an expansion of the base underway, it remains unclear what the purpose of the new structures will be.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s claim that &quot;there is now no safe base and no completely reliable logistical route in Crimea and on the occupied parts of the Black Sea and Azov coast&quot; was viewed by some in Georgia that Ukrainian missiles and naval drones could soon be hitting Russian ships moored in sovereign, yet occupied, Georgian territory. The possibility only added fuel to the rhetoric from the governing Russian-friendly Georgian Dream party, members of which have regularly claimed that the West is trying to push Georgia into the war. The developments in Ochamchire come against the backdrop of Tbilisi&apos;s warming relations with Moscow and deteriorating ties with the West. Protesters rally against the controversial &quot;foreign influence&quot; bill in Tbilisi, Georgia on May 8, 2024. The country has been gripped by mass anti-government protests since April 9, after the ruling Georgian Dream party reintroduced the bill, which critics see as repressive. (Giorgi Arjevanidze/AFP via Getty Images)Under the ruling Georgian Dream party, Georgia has seen democratic backsliding, which has been accompanied by a growing push for rapprochement with Russia. Georgian Dream officials, such as former Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili, nonetheless reacted critically to the proposed plans at Ochamchire, calling it an &quot;illegal decision&quot; that was &quot;the result of (Russian) occupation.&quot; In response to Zelensky&apos;s statement, Abkhazian leader Bzhania accused Ukraine of trying to &quot;provoke a military situation in the Caucasus and unleash a new bloody war.&quot; But a larger dynamic is unfolding between Russia and Abkhazia, which Moscow has controlled and financially supported since 2008. Following a series of disagreements between Abkhazia and Russia, particularly the Abkhaz government&apos;s decision in the face of street protests to abandon a bill that would have legalized the sale of real estate to foreigners, relations between Sukhumi and Moscow have plunged to new lows. Abkhaz Foreign Minister Sergei Shamba said earlier in September that Russia had decided to suspend aid to Abkhazia in response to its unwillingness to implement pro-Russian legislation (such as the apartment bill), which Shamba called a &quot;serious blow&quot; to their bilateral ties. In an illustration of the often contradictory news about the port, Shamba said in August that there are &quot;no plans&quot; to establish a Russian naval base at Ochamchire, despite satellite imagery showing construction work and the occupied territory having no navy of its own.

(Contributor/Getty Images)At the same time, Abkhazia&apos;s financial dependency on Russia puts it in a difficult position. &quot;A lot will depend on the Abkhazian de facto government&apos;s continued ability to resist Moscow&apos;s overreaches &#x2013; something they&apos;ve done quite successfully over the past few years,&quot; said Maia Otarashvili, director of the Eurasia Program at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. &quot;The Ochamchire port clearly offers a financial opportunity to the insolvent Bzhania government,&quot; Otarashvili told the Kyiv Independent. Aside from the inconsistency coming from Abkhazia, the future of the Ochamchire base is also tied to political developments in Tbilisi. &quot;A lot will depend on the outcome of Georgia&apos;s October parliamentary election &#x2013; if Georgian Dream is reelected with full majority, (Georgian oligarch and de facto leader Bidzina) Ivanishvili&apos;s designs on (a) complete monopoly over Georgia and its pro-Russian path will only intensify,&quot; said Otarashvili.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-continues-construction-of-a-naval-base-in-occupied-abkhazia-ukraine-hinted-it-will-be-a-legitimate-target/	2024-09-24T11:54:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-24-at-19_49_55.png
Russian troops constantly storming Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, situation 'steadily tense,' Ukraine's military says	Russian forces are continuously storming the town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, with the situation remaining &quot;steadily tense,&quot; an infantry commander of the 72nd Mechanized Brigade, known as &quot;Oscar,&quot; told Suspilne on Sept. 24. While there are signs of stabilization near Pokrovsk, the focal point of Russia&#x2019;s offensive in Donetsk Oblast, the situation is becoming increasingly difficult near Vuhledar. The front-line town lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The 72nd Mechanized Brigade has defended Vuhledar for nearly two years, as Russian forces have been trying to capture the town since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Russian troops are constantly pushing toward Vuhledar, attempting to advance from different directions along the front line, according to the Ukrainian commander. &quot;As soon as (Russian forces) find an opportunity to advance, they start to deploy their attack units there,&quot; he added. Russia is using a variety of weapons in its assaults on Vuhledar, including guided aerial bombs, armored vehicles, cannon artillery, mortars, and first-person-view (FPV) drones, Oscar added. &quot;All types of troops and all means available are being deployed by the Russian army in this direction,&quot; he said. &quot;The enemy has &apos;disposable&apos; equipment. Every armored vehicle that approaches our positions is mostly burned, and there are assaults every day,&quot; he said. Andrii Kovalenko, head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, said on Sept. 24 that Russia has devastated the town of Vuhledar and is attempting to advance from the flanks. The small mining town of Vuhledar has lied close to the front line since 2014 and has been well-fortified in case of further Russian aggression. Vuhledar has withstood numerous attacks since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022 and has become a key to Ukrainian defenses in the southern part of Donetsk Oblast. &quot;The loss of Vuhledar would be not only a morale blow for Ukraine since this city has resisted plenty of assaults since 2022, but also a very serious development that can potentially threaten the security of the entire southwestern portion of Donetsk Oblast not yet occupied, along with the threat to Pokrovsk&apos;s southern flank,&quot; Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-constantly-storming-vuhledar-in-donetsk-oblast-situation-steadily-tense-ukraines-military-says/	2024-09-24T11:26:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1858325206.jpg
From Ukraine to a galaxy far away: How Ukrainian AI-voice company Respeecher became the go-to for Hollywood	Editor&#x2019;s note: This article is part of a series of profiles highlighting successful Ukrainian startups and businesses. The series is funded by the regional investment fund Ukraine-Moldova American Enterprise Fund (UMAEF) and created in partnership with Spend With Ukraine, a non-profit organization that launched a platform to showcase businesses with Ukrainian roots and provide one more meaningful way to support Ukraine &#x2013; by choosing to spend with Ukraine. The series&#x2019; sponsors are not involved in the editorial process of the writing of these profiles. Alex Serdiuk, CEO of Kyiv-based AI voice company Respeecher, knew the company was onto a winner when no one noticed that the voice of veteran Star Wars actor Mark Hamill had been altered to sound younger in Disney&#x2019;s hit show The Mandalorian. Respeecher used decades-old footage to clone a young Hamill&#x2019;s voice and make it sound like the now 72-year-old Hollywood star had just stepped into the studio to record his lines. While some criticized the CGI used to make Hamill&#x2019;s face youthful again, few were aware that his voice had been altered too. Disney only revealed the fact six months later. &#x201C;That was a huge confirmation that we are doing an amazing job. If you don&#x2019;t hear a synthetic (voice), it means Respeecher did our job right,&#x201D; Serdiuk told the Kyiv Independent on the rooftop of Respeecher&#x2019;s downtown Kyiv office. Serdiuk founded the company in 2018 alongside Dmytro Bielievtsov and Grant Reaber, a U.S. citizen, with $150,000 in investment and the idea to clone and alter voices. With Respeecher, Disney can feature the voices of actors who have passed away, such as James Earl Jones, or help laryngectomy patients by replicating their voice for an electro-larynx device, an electronic voice box. Investors have funneled $4 million into the company since 2018. Respeecher has become the go-to for Hollywood studios with over 300 clients including Sony, Netflix, and Warner Bros., and has more than 170 projects already under its belt. The team is spearheading the new AI voice market, raking in six Emmys, two Webbys, and a Clio Award for advertising and design. A team of Respeecher in an undated photo with a backdrop of space. (Personal archive / Getty Images)Despite making a name in such a short period, the company has battled a difficult two years. The mental turmoil of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion weighs heavy on the 30-person team, the majority of whom chose to remain in Ukraine, and operating costs have spiked by up to 10% due to expensive vital equipment like generators and Starlink satellite internet systems. Moreover, the Hollywood strikes last year, when actors and writers fought for better pay and job security in the face of AI, ground production to a halt. Respeecher lost nearly half its revenue, resulting in staff layoffs as the company grappled to stay afloat. Nevertheless, Serdiuk said the company still managed to grow by 40% last year from 2022 and predicts that the AI voice market, part of the broader digital likeness market, is on the precipice of huge growth as the technology enters the mainstream. &#x201C;The technology brings crazy disruption. You can now detach a human from their voice. You can speak perfect Ukrainian or Chinese,&#x201D; he noted. Sirdiuk said that regulation in the U.S. and Europe is catching up, protecting celebrities&#x2019; rights to their likeness and curbing the Wild West of the last few years. In turn, celebrities are becoming more comfortable with the technology, allowing bigger projects to take place, such as a virtual Kiss concert that Disney has invested $200 million into. Trust and ethics are important qualities for Respeecher, according to Sirdiuk, especially as some companies have used AI voice technology to replicate celebrities&apos; voices for pornography or to spread disinformation. Respeecher, Sirdiuk said, first gets the permission of celebrities or their estates to clone a voice and doesn&#x2019;t publicly release its tech to avoid misuse. The company has also turned down offers from politicians keen to use the technology to run hyper-personalized ads, preferring to keep the company out of politics. With rising concerns over AI voices, Respeecher partners with deep-fake detectors to help train their software to pick up on AI voice patterns. Building trust is important, Siriduk believes, and helps Respeecher stay ahead of its competitors. However, he mentions that venture capitalists may not always agree, preferring rapid growth over ethics. &#x201C;Trust and quality go together,&#x201D; he stressed. The voice technology market is already crowded, with companies like Google and Amazon developing their own software, but none are suitable for films as they are noticeably artificial, Serdiuk said. What separates Respeecher from other AI voice companies is its emphasis on the sound department, the largest part of the company, rather than just focusing on the technical aspect, according to Serdiuk. A screengrab of Respeecher software on the backdrop of space. (Respeecher / Getty Images)While the quality of technology can be quantified and optimized, the naturalness of sound is subjective and requires a fine ear and creativity. &#x201C;You have to optimize towards speaker identity; Whether it sounds like me or not, and whether it transfers all those details that make my voice special,&#x201D; Serdiuk said. He points to Ukraine&#x2019;s highly regarded film dubbing sector and rich musical history as a key reason for its talented sound engineer pool. Even in the Kyiv office, instruments are scattered about, ready for the occasional workplace jam session. While based in Kyiv, the company doesn&#x2019;t have many projects within the Ukrainian film market, although Siriduk believes this could change in the future with Ukraine gaining an international standing. However, they occasionally work pro-bono with journalists to mask the voices of victims of war crimes while keeping the emotions and inflections that voice morphers eradicate. Siriduk is proud that his team has remained in Ukraine, despite investors unhappy with Respeecher being located outside Hollywood. But they did not lose any clients at the start of the full-scale invasion and even managed to stick to deadlines while missiles rained down across the country. &#x201C;The credibility we got in the market by that time was sufficient enough for our big clients to believe that we can deliver and that we are still in the game,&#x201D; Siriduk said. &#x201C;Two and a half years have passed and we keep doing projects.&#x201D; Respeecher is a prime example of Ukrainian innovation, transforming global industries, from entertainment and beyond, with its cutting-edge AI voice technology.

Zelensky's 'victory plan' contains 'no surprises,' Bloomberg reports	Western officials do not see a &quot;breakthrough&quot; in President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s &quot;victory plan,&quot; which he is presenting this week in New York, Bloomberg reported on Sept. 24, citing undisclosed sources. Kyiv has remained secretive about the plan&apos;s details, which Zelensky is set to discuss with U.S. President Joe Biden during his visit. According to Zelensky, the &quot;victory plan&quot; consists of five points, focusing on Ukraine&apos;s security and geopolitical position, foreign military aid with the freedom to use it without restrictions, and economic support. In addition to a NATO invitation and a pledge for arms supplies, Bloomberg previously reported that the plan includes a clear pathway to European Union membership. One official described the plan as a &quot;wish list,&quot; while another source familiar with Zelensky&apos;s discussions with foreign leaders said it contained &quot;no surprises&quot; and was not a &quot;major game-changer,&quot; Bloomberg wrote. At least one ally suggested it may be time for &quot;a new round of outreach to Russian President Vladimir Putin, either by Zelensky or other countries,&quot; the two officials told the media outlet. Zelensky reportedly unveiled the plan on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly&#x2019;s annual session. One source noted that while allies are committed to supporting Ukraine for as long as necessary, Zelensky needs to clarify what peace might look like. World leaders gathered in New York on Sept. 23 for the 79th U.N. General Assembly. Zelensky, who arrived in the U.S. on Sept. 22, is using the opportunity to promote his &quot;victory plan&quot; and Ukraine&apos;s second global peace summit. Zelensky is expected to present the plan to Biden at the White House on Sept. 26. He also plans to discuss it with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.	https://kyivindependent.com/western-officials-see-no-breakthrough-in-zelenskys-victory-plan-bloomberg-reports/	2024-09-24T11:11:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168195934.jpg
Ukrainian Air Force retracts report of Belarusian aircraft violating airspace	The Ukrainian Air Force retracted an earlier statement that an aerial target violated Ukrainian airspace from Belarus on the afternoon of Sept. 24. The Air Force initially reported that a low-speed aerial target had crossed the border from Belarus near Kyiv and Zhytomyr oblasts at around 2:30 p.m. local time, heading south toward Kyiv Oblast. Non-state military monitoring groups, including Belarusian Hajun and Monitor, also reported that a &#xA0;Belarusian Yak-130 combat aircraft had entered Ukrainian airspace. The plane reportedly crossed the Ukraine-Belarus border at 2:28 p.m. local time near the village of Dyatlyk in Belarus&apos; Homel Oblast, which borders Ukraine&apos;s Chernihiv, Kyiv, and Zhytomyr oblasts. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims made by the monitoring groups. Later in the day, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force said the detected object was likely a radar jammer, a false target. Belarus, Moscow&apos;s closest ally, hosts Russian troops, missiles, and aircraft but is not directly involved in Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko said in an Aug. 15 interview that a third of Belarus&apos; army had been moved to the Ukrainian border earlier this summer. Speaking to Russia&apos;s Rossiya TV channel, Lukashenko claimed the move was in response to a buildup of Ukrainian troops, which he said was triggered by a misinterpretation of Belarus&apos; preparations for its Independence Day celebrations on July 3.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-air-force-retracts-report-of-belarusian-aircraft-violating-airspace/	2024-09-24T10:34:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-678825081.jpg
Russia attacks Kharkiv's densely populated districts, killing 3, injuring 28	Russian forces struck Kharkiv, Ukraine&apos;s second-largest city, on Sept. 24, killing at least three and injuring 28 people, local authorities reported. Russia bombarded the city with guided aerial bombs, targeting densely populated districts, Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov reported at around 3:30 p.m. local time. Kharkiv&apos;s four districts were under attack, with residential high-rise buildings damaged in the Kyivskyi and Saltivskyi districts. Terekhov said that Russia used eight FAB-250 bombs in the attack, while Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov said that one of the strikes was carried out with a FAB-500 bomb. One of the high-rise buildings came under a direct Russian strike, according to Syniehubov. People are trapped under the rubble; emergency services are continuing search and rescue operations at the scene, Syniehubov added. Terekhov said that one of the buildings, which was damaged in the Kyivskyi district, had already been attacked in the beginning of the full-scale invasion. According to the mayor, it was almost repaired, insulated, and prepared for the heating season before Russian forces struck it again. Some 82 people lived in the section of the building that suffered the most severe damage, Terekhov said. &quot;We are now trying to contact all of them to find out if people are under the rubble,&quot; he added. One of the strikes also hit a food industry enterprise, Terekhov said at around 5:30 p.m. local time. The youngest victim is a 17-year-old girl, while the oldest is an 87-year-old woman. The majority of the injured are in moderate condition, with four people in serious condition. Three people are in surgery as of 6 p.m. local time, according to Syniehubov. President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is currently attending the U.N. General Assembly&apos;s High-Level Week in New York, condemned the Russian attack on Kharkiv and called on allies to &quot;stop the terror.&quot; &quot;There is a lot of talk at the U.N. General Assembly about collective efforts for security and the future. But we just need to stop the terror. To have security. To have the future. We need Russia to stop this criminal and unprovoked aggression that violates all global rules,&quot; Zelensky said. Kharkiv has been under constant Russian attacks for more than two years since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-attacks-kharkivs-densely-populated-districts-killing-3-injuring-24/	2024-09-24T07:58:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2024-09-24-17_14_05.jpeg
Zelensky, Modi discuss strengthening cooperation in New York	President Volodymyr Zelensky has met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss strengthening cooperation between Kyiv and New Delhi on Sept. 24 in New York, President&apos;s Office reported. Zelensky arrived in New York two days earlier to attend the U.N. General Assembly&apos;s High-Level Week. Ukraine&apos;s president last met with Modi on Aug. 23 during the Indian official&apos;s historic visit to Kyiv. In New York, Zelensky and Modi discussed trade, economic and defense cooperation, India&apos;s involvement in Ukraine&apos;s post-war reconstruction, and collaboration in educational, scientific, and cultural initiatives, according to the statement. The two also discussed strengthening cooperation on international platforms, including the U.N. and G20, as well as implementing Ukraine&apos;s peace formula and preparing for the second peace summit scheduled for November. &quot;We are committed to implementing the outcomes of my visit to Ukraine last month to strengthen bilateral relations. Reiterated India&apos;s support for early resolution of the conflict in Ukraine and restoration of peace and stability,&quot; Modi wrote on X. Zelensky also thanked the Indian prime minister for &quot;clear support&quot; of Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The meeting between Zelensky and Modi in New York was the third over the last year. Ukraine and India approved four cooperation agreements in August during Modi&apos;s first visit to Ukraine. The parties did not disclose the details of the deals. Modi&apos;s trip to Ukraine came just weeks after a visit to Moscow, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The visit included a widely criticized hug between the two leaders on July 8, hours after Russia bombed the Okhmatdyt children&apos;s hospital in Kyiv, killing two people and injuring more than 50. A historical ally of Russia, India has maintained its close economic and diplomatic ties with Moscow since February 2022, with bilateral trade reaching a historic high in 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-modi-discuss-strengthening-cooperation-in-new-york/	2024-09-24T07:12:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GYMMcTSWgAAdrgc.jpeg
Ukraine regains control of Vovchansk aggregate plant, military intelligence says	Ukrainian forces recaptured an aggregate plant in the town of Vovchansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Sept. 24. HUR Chief Kyrylo Budanov was briefed on the &quot;successful completion of the operation&quot; earlier in the day, the agency said in a statement, adding the &quot;extremely difficult&quot; attack was carried out by HUR special forces. &quot;The fighters of HUR carried out a systematic sweep of the plant&apos;s buildings, constantly engaging in contact battles with the enemy in densely built-up conditions. In some cases, Ukrainian special forces engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy,&quot; it added. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces took under control the territory of the aggregate plant after all 30 buildings were cleared (of Russian forces).&quot; Vovchansk is an embattled town some 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Kharkiv that has seen heavy battles since Russia launched a new offensive in the area in May. While initially gaining ground in May, the Russian offensive in northern Kharkiv Oblast has quickly bogged down, with Russian troops reportedly suffering heavy losses. The intensity of fighting has decreased somewhat compared to other sectors, though several reports of Russia preparing new attacks have emerged since then. Some observers believe that the offensive helped to stretch Ukrainian forces as Russia intensified its push in Donetsk Oblast, focusing on towns like Pokrovsk, Toretsk, and Chasiv Yar.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-regains-control-of-vovchansk/	2024-09-24T06:15:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/--------------2024-09-24-155839.png
Russia surveilling Ukrainian nuclear facilities with Chinese satellites for possible future strikes, Zelensky says	Russia is using Chinese satellites to take pictures of Ukraine&apos;s nuclear facilities for possible future attacks, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with ABC News aired on Sept. 24. &quot;The recent information is that Russia has been using Chinese satellites and taking photos of the details of the objects on nuclear facilities,&quot; the president said. &quot;And in our experience, if Russia takes photos of certain objects, then there is a threat of strikes against the nuclear objects.&quot; He did not elaborate on whether Chinese satellites were commercial or controlled by the Chinese government. Zelensky &apos;s remarks come after warnings from Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, who said on Sept. 21 that Russia&apos;s possible targets include open distribution devices at nuclear power plants (NPP) and transmission substations &quot;which are essential for the safe functioning of the nuclear energy system.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s special services informed Kyiv&apos;s partners and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) about the threat. There are three operating nuclear power plants on the Ukrainian-held territory &#x2014; Rivne and Khmelnytskyi NPPs in the country&apos;s west, and Pivdennoukrainsk NPP in the south. Russia&apos;s regular attacks put their safety in jeopardy by cutting off power to the units. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe&apos;s largest nuclear power station, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. Throughout its occupation, the plant has been repeatedly disconnected from the Ukrainian power grid due to Russian attacks on the country&apos;s energy infrastructure. Ukraine&apos;s National Resistance Center reported on Sept. 15 that Russian forces continued to use the territory of the occupied power plant to deploy military personnel and store ammunition and explosives.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-takes-photos-of-ukrainian-nuclear-facilities-with-chinese-satellites-for-possible-attacks-zelensky-says/	2024-09-24T05:34:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168195934.jpg
Zelensky wants Democrats to win US presidential election, Trump claims	Donald Trump claimed in a speech on Sept. 23 that President Volodymyr Zelensky wants the Democrats to win the U.S. presidential election. Speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania, Trump said that if elected he would do things &quot;differently&quot; to the current administration. President Joe Biden, who has sat in the White House throughout the full-scale war and played a key role in building the pro-Kyiv coalition, positioned Washington as Ukraine&apos;s leading military donor. Early next year, Biden will pass over the keys for the White House either to Democratic candidate Kamala Harris or her Republican challenger, Trump. &quot;I think Zelensky is the greatest salesman in history. Every time he comes into the country, he walks away with 60 billion dollars,&quot; Trump said. &quot;He wants them to win this election so badly, but I would do (it) differently &#x2014; I will work out peace.&quot; Trump&apos;s possible return to the White House is causing concern in Ukraine. The pro-Trump wing of the Republican Party blocked the U.S. aid bill in Congress for months earlier this year, which proved detrimental to the situation on the Ukrainian battlefields and contributed to the loss of a key city of Avdiivka. Statements and rumors coming from Trump&apos;s inner circle also suggest he might seek to pressure Ukraine to cede territory or give up its NATO aspirations to achieve a quicker resolution of the war. The ex-president has repeatedly said he would end the war within &quot;24 hours if reelected&quot; and evaded a question about whether he wants Ukraine to win during a recent debate with Harris. In response to Trump&apos;s Sept. 23 comments, Morgan Finkelstein in a campaign email called out Trump for not stating that he wants Ukraine to win the war. &quot;Vice President Harris understands that if America walks away from Ukraine, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe and our NATO allies,&quot; he said. Zelensky is currently in the U.S. to attend the 79th U.N. General Assembly in New York and present a five-point victory plan to the American leadership.&#x200B;&#x200B; Trump previously said he would &quot;probably&quot; meet with Zelensky, as the Ukrainian leader said he also wants to present the victory plan to him.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-wants-democrats-to-win-us-presidential-election-trump-claims/	2024-09-24T05:15:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173999809.jpg
Around 60% of foreign parts in Russian weapons come via China, Ukraine says	Most of the foreign parts found in Russian weapons used on the battlefield against Ukraine come from China, Vladyslav Vlasiuk, an adviser to Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office, said on Sept. 24. China has positioned itself as neutral in the ongoing war but has deepened economic ties with Russia and become Moscow&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, fueling the Kremlin&apos;s war machine. &quot;If you take all the usual types of weapons and count the foreign made components, about 60% would be coming from China,&quot; Vlasiuk said in comments reported by Reuters, calling Beijing &quot;the biggest problem.&quot; Vlasiuk said that Kyiv held talks with some manufacturers on the issue, without providing further details. Important parts used in surveillance systems, drones and missiles also come from countries inclusing the U.S., the Netherlands, Japan and Switzerland, he added. Despite extensive Western sanctions aimed at cutting off supply lines, Russia continues to obtain sanctioned goods, such as microchips, via third-party countries. Kyiv&apos;s allies have sought to halt the Kremlin&apos;s ability to circumvent sanctions. One of the EU&apos;s sanctions package included a ban for third-country entities to re-export sensitive goods to Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia uses dozens of critical components from abroad to produce all its missiles. Missiles launched at Kyiv in one of the spring attacks had an estimated total of 1,500 foreign parts.	https://kyivindependent.com/china/	2024-09-24T04:10:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240131265.jpg
Invitation to NATO part of Ukraine's victory plan, Yermak confirms	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. An invitation to join NATO is part of Ukraine&apos;s victory plan, the head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak said during a visit to the U.S. on Sept. 24. President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to present the victory plan to U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House on Sept. 26. He also plans to discuss it with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s invitation to NATO is part of the victory plan,&quot; Yermak said in a post on Telegram. According to the information obtained by the Kyiv Independent on Sept. 22, Ukraine would ask for NATO membership within the months, not years. Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Yermak said that the five-point victory plan includes both diplomatic and military components. &quot;I also urged our partners to ignore Russia&apos;s threats of escalation,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-victory-plan-includes-invitation-to-nato-yermak-confirms/	2024-09-24T02:44:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168960421.jpg
Russia to maintain record high defense spending in 2025, Bloomberg reports	The Kremlin will maintain record high defense spending in 2025, Bloomberg reported on Sept. 24 citing draft budget proposals seen by the outlet. With no immediate end to the war in Ukraine in sight, the Russian government will increase defense spending to 13.2 trillion rubles ($142 billion) in 2025 from a projected 10.4 trillion rubles ($111 billion) in 2024. In contrast, social spending is expected to amount to 7.7 trillion rubles ($87 billion), or 21.1% of the Russian budget in 2024. NATO countries have set a goal to spend 2 percent of the country&#x2019;s GDP on defense in 2024. Russia is spending around 6 percent. Russia is on track for an intense economic slowdown due to significant labor shortages and constraints placed on the key sectors that backed growth until now, it was reported on Aug. 9. Labor resources are practically drained while the competition between the military and business for recruits becomes more fierce. This is likely to limit the further growth of defense-related industries. The banking and construction sectors are no longer protected from the impacts of high interest rates as the government shuts down the state-subsidized mortgage programs. Despite Russia&apos;s GDP growing by 4% in the first quarter of the year, it will likely slow down to 2% in the last half of the year and hit 0.5% - 1.5% in 2025, says Alex Isakov, Russia economist at Bloomberg Economics.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-to-maintain-record-high-defense-spending-in-2025-bloomberg-reports/	2024-09-24T02:34:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2149287288.jpg
Blocking Ukraine's EU accession over Volyn massacre in line with Putin's policy, Poland's Duda says	Threats to block Ukraine&apos;s accession to the European Union are in line with Kremlin policy, Polish President Andrzej Duda said in an interview with Polsat News published on Sept 23. Duda&apos;s criticism was in response to recent remarks by Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, who said that Ukraine should not join the EU until the historical issue of the massacre of Poles in Volyn is resolved. The minister was referring to the 1943 massacre of tens of thousands of Poles by members of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) in Nazi-occupied Volyn, a region that used to be part of Poland and is now part of Ukraine. Thousands of Ukrainians were killed in retaliation. Despite several attempts at reconciliation between modern-day Poland and Ukraine, the issue has come to the forefront of public discussion several times, namely during the tenure of the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, which was in power between 2015 and 2023. According to Duda, one of the reasons Putin attacked Ukraine was to prevent the country from joining the EU. &quot;If someone says in this regard that they are going to block Ukraine&apos;s access to the European Union, they are following Vladimir Putin&apos;s policy. I don&apos;t know if this is the intention of those who are now in power,&quot; Duda said. In summer 2023, Duda visited the town of Lutsk to commemorate with Zelensky the victims of the Volyn tragedy, which was seen as an important move amid the tensions between the two nations regarding the issue. &quot;It is also in Ukraine&apos;s interest to find an understanding with us on all complex issues, including historical ones,&quot; Duda said in the interview. Zelensky promised in 2019 to lift the Ukrainian moratorium on the exhumation of Volyn victims, imposed in reaction to cases of destruction of UPA memorials in Poland. The matter has not yet been resolved, however, and Polish President Andrzej Duda said in 2023 that obtaining permission for the exhumations plays a crucial role in Polish-Ukrainian relations. Ukrainian historian Serhii Plokhy, director of the Ukrainian Research Institute at Harvard University, estimates that the number of Polish victims of the massacre varies from 60,000 to 90,000. The number of Ukrainians killed by Poles in the 1940s is estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000, including between 2,000 and 3,000 in Volyn, according to Polish historian Grzegorz Motyka. In 2016, Poland&apos;s parliament recognized the killings as a genocide, a term that Ukraine denies.	https://kyivindependent.com/duda-opposes-intentions-to-block-ukraines-eu-accession-over-volyn-tragedy/	2024-09-24T02:00:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2023-07-09_11-39-24.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 4, injure 39 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed four people and injured 39 over the past day, regional authorities said on Sept. 24. Ukrainian forces downed 66 out of 81 Shahed-type drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Thirteen more drones were &quot;lost&quot; in a few regions, according to the statement. Russian forces also launched an Iskander-M ballistic missile, two Kh-59/69 cruise missiles and one missile of a type yet to be determined. A Russian overnight attack on the city of Zaporizhzhia killed one person and injured at least seven others, including a 15-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl, according to Governor Ivan Fedorov. The strike targeted a critical infrastructure facility and a residential neighborhood. A house was destroyed and more than 70 apartment buildings were damaged, Fedorov said. In Kharkiv Oblast, an attack on Kupiansk killed an 82-year-old woman, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Another woman, aged 59, suffered injuries after Russian forces attacked the village of Osynovo, the governor said. One person was killed in the town of Kramatorsk and another in the village of Udachne in the Pokrovsk district, Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. A total of 18 people suffered injuries in the region over the past day, he added. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 23 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Thirteen people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-4-injure-39-over-past-day/	2024-09-24T00:53:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2024-09-24_09-30-49.jpg
Temporary' occupation of Ukrainian territory most likely outcome of Russia's full-scale invasion, Czech president says	The &quot;temporary&quot; occupation of some Ukrainian territories by Russia is the most likely outcome of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion, Czech President Petr Pavel said in an interview published on Sept. 23. Speaking to The New York Times (NYT), Pavel said neither Ukraine nor Russia should expect to achieve outright victory. &quot;To talk about a defeat of Ukraine or defeat of Russia, it will simply not happen. So the end will be somewhere in between,&quot; he said. As of late August, Russia was in control of around 27% of Ukrainian territory, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts are partially controlled by Russian troops. Russia claims to have annexed the whole territory of those regions despite not controlling two regional capitals &#x2014; Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. &#xA0;Moscow also controls all of Ukraine&apos;s Crimean peninsula. Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the illegal annexation of four oblasts in September 2022, and in June called for Ukrainian troops to leave these territories as a condition for peace negotiations, a proposal which was rejected by Ukraine. Pavel said that Ukraine &quot;will have to be realistic&quot; about the prospects of recapturing the Russian-occupied territories. &quot;The most probable outcome of the war will be that a part of Ukrainian territory will be under Russian occupation, temporarily,&quot; Pavel said, though he added this could last for years. Ukraine says peace talks should be held on the basis of its 10-step peace formula, which includes a full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. Zelensky is also expected to present his &quot;victory plan&quot; to President Joe Biden during his ongoing visit to the U.S. this week. &quot;There is not and cannot be any alternative to peace, no freezing of the war or any other manipulations that will simply move Russian aggression to another stage,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address on Sept. 18.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-needs-to-be-realistic/	2024-09-23T23:51:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2160995526.jpg
Putin is very much afraid' — Zelensky says Kursk incursion exposed Kremlin's weaknesses to Russian public	Russian President Vladimir Putin is &quot;very much afraid&quot; of Ukraine&apos;s ongoing incursion in Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview to be aired on Sept. 24. Speaking to ABC News, Zelensky said the operation exposed serious weaknesses in the Kremlin&apos;s leadership and its ability to protect its people. &quot;It&apos;s true. He&apos;s afraid very much,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;Why? Because his people saw that he can&apos;t defend... all his territory.&quot; Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in early August, claiming to have seized around 100 settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles). Russia appeared to have been taken by surprise by the attack, which allowed Ukrainian forces to quickly fan out across the border and move deep into Russian territory. According to the seized documents, Russian commanders had been cautioning that a potential cross-border breakthrough could occur as far back as January 2024, but little action was taken. The Good Morning America interview with Zelensky and First Lady Olena Zelenska comes as world leaders convene in New York City for the 79th U.N. General Assembly. Zelensky, who arrived in the U.S. on Sept. 22, is using the opportunity to champion his &quot;victory plan&quot; and Ukraine&apos;s second global peace summit. He is expected to present the victory plan to Biden at the White House on Sept. 26. He also plans to discuss it with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. In the interview, Zelensky said the plan aims to achieve the &quot;strengthening of Ukraine.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s why we&apos;re asking our friends, our allies, to strengthen us. It&apos;s very important,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;I think that we are closer to peace than we think. &quot;We are closer to the end of the war. We just have to be very strong, very strong.&quot; On Sept. 23, Zelensky met with a bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation on Sept. 23, including Senators Ben Cardin, Dan Sullivan, Chris Murphy, and Congressman Gregory Meeks, to express gratitude for their critical support of Ukraine. He updated them on Ukraine&apos;s current security situation and the challenges anticipated next year. Zelensky said that &quot;decisive action now can accelerate a just end to the war,&quot; adding that Ukraine&#x2019;s victory plan aims to bring peace.&quot; American leadership plays a crucial role in defending freedom worldwide,&quot; Zelensky wrote on X, thanking Congress for its unwavering commitment.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-is-very-much-afraid-zelensky-says-kursk-incursion-exposed-kremlins-weaknesses/	2024-09-23T22:50:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172350481.jpg

This incident follows a similar attack on September 11, when two younger boys set fire to a Mi-8 helicopter at Noyabrsk airport in the Tyumen region. In addition to these attacks, various sabotage incidents, including train derailments, have occurred across regions of Russia.

Zelensky, Japanese PM Kishida meet in US, discuss energy sector	President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in the U.S. on Sept. 23 to discuss Ukraine&apos;s energy sector challenges, Zelensky reported via Telegram. World leaders convened in New York City on Sept. 23 for the 79th U.N. General Assembly. Zelensky, who arrived in the U.S. on Sept. 22, is using the opportunity to champion his &quot;victory plan&quot; and Ukraine&apos;s second global peace summit. Zelensky and Kishida discussed Japan&apos;s ongoing support for Ukraine, with particular focus on Ukraine&apos;s energy sector. Kishida said Tokyo is readying an additional energy assistance package for Kyiv. &quot;Together with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, we discussed the situation in the energy sector,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Thank you for the new energy assistance package that Japan is preparing.&quot; According to Kishida, the package will include transformers, generators, and other equipment. The leaders also discussed strategies to prevent Russia from evading international sanctions and mechanisms by which Ukraine can receive up to $50 billion in frozen Russian assets. Since the launch of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Japan has committed over $12 billion in humanitarian, economic, and other assistance to Ukraine. Japan has also supported Ukraine&apos;s energy sector, which has suffered billions in damage due to Russian attacks, and shared expertise on nuclear safety. Under a security agreement signed in June, Tokyo pledged to provide Ukraine with an additional $4.5 billion in 2024 and continue supporting the country throughout the next 10 years.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-japanese-pm-kishida-meet-in-us-discuss-energy-sector/	2024-09-23T15:57:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/kishida.jpeg
Russian strike on Zaporizhzhia kills 1, injures 5, including 13-year-old girl	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia attacked the city of Zaporizhzhia the night of Sept. 23, killing one man and injuring five other civilians, including a 13-year-old girl, city authorities reported. The strike targeted a critical infrastructure facility and a residential neighborhood, Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Ivan Fedorov reported via his official Telegram channel. The attack in the residential area killed one man and injured five others, among them a 13-year-old girl, City Council Secretary Regina Kharchenko said. Some of the victims were hospitalized. At least two houses were also destroyed, Fedorov said. The attack on the critical infrastructure facility caused a fire, but no casualties, Fedorov said. The fire has since been extinguished. Emergency workers are on site and the full extent of the damage is currently being investigated. Attacks against Zaporizhzhia the previous night injured 22 people, including two children. Monitoring groups reported that the night&apos;s attacks marked the first time a guided aerial bomb was used to target Zaporizhzhia. Fedorov warned residents on Sept. 23 at about 9:51 p.m. local time that there was threat of guided aerial bombs over the city. The city of Zaporizhzhia is located less than 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the front lines. Russia has continued to strike civilian targets across Zaporizhzhia Oblast, which is partially occupied by Russian forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-strike-on-zaporizhzhia-kills-1-injures-5-including-13-year-old-girl/	2024-09-23T15:01:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/zap.jpg
Russia and its 'accomplices' want to disrupt global unity, Zelensky tells UN	Russia and its &quot;accomplices&quot; are actively trying to prevent global unity, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the United Nations&apos; Summit of the Future on Sept. 23. Zelensky arrived in the U.S. on Sept. 22, ahead of the 79th U.N. General Assembly and a series of meetings with world leaders devoted to presenting Ukraine&apos;s &quot;victory plan.&quot; The Summit of the Future 2024, held at U.N. headquarters in New York City, covers a broad range of global themes, including peace and security. &quot;You all can see who always not only stands against (the U.N. charter), but also actively works to undermine global unity,&quot; Zelensky said in his address during the plenary session of the summit. &quot;The same small group of seven accomplices, led by Russia, has once again acted destructively, always opposing any global initiatives that strengthen the effectiveness of the U.N. charter.&quot; Zelensky did not list Russia&apos;s &quot;accomplices&quot; by name, but said this group has &quot;always behaved this way,&quot; seeking to undermine U.N. efforts and rule of law. Zelensky urged world leaders to join Ukraine&apos;s efforts &quot;to overcome the destructiveness of Russia and its accomplices,&quot; calling on nations to participate in the next global peace summit for Ukraine. &quot;Putin has stolen much already, but he will never steal the world&apos;s future,&quot; he said. Ukraine&apos;s goals for peace, including the president&apos;s much-anticipated victory plan, are the focus of Zelensky&apos;s U.S. tour. Zelensky is expected to present the details of the plan to U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House on Sept. 26. The five-point plan reportedly includes Ukraine&apos;s fast-tracked accession to the NATO alliance. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-and-its-accomplices-want-to-disrupt-global-unity-zelensky-tells-un/	2024-09-23T14:26:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173251936.jpg
Biden-Zelensky talks: Ukrainian soldiers want firepower to win but question if US wants Russia defeated	As President Volodymyr Zelensky kicked off a visit to the U.S. this week in a bid to secure more firepower for his army, Ukrainian soldiers on the ground monitored the news with half-hearted hope, questioning whether Kyiv&#x2019;s top Western ally would provide enough to help them defeat Russia. In a historic trip more than two years into Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Zelensky is set to present what he describes as Ukraine&apos;s &#x201C;victory plan&#x201D; to his American counterpart, Joe Biden. He hopes that if backed by the outgoing U.S. president, it will include the weaponry needed and the lifting of restrictions on deep strikes into Russia using Western missiles. &#xA0; The Ukrainian leader began the U.S. visit in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden&apos;s hometown, at an ammunition factory arming Ukraine&apos;s artillery units with shells. Zelensky is due to travel on to the UN General Assembly in New York and later Washington, D.C. Thousands of kilometers away on the hottest spots of the front line in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, multiple soldiers told the Kyiv Independent that they don&#x2019;t anticipate notable progress from Zelensky&#x2019;s efforts to win over Biden but agreed on the importance of pressing Western allies for permission to use their long-range weapons on Russian territory. The trip comes as Ukrainian forces hold on to a patch of Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast weeks after conducting a surprise incursion and as Russian troops carried on with a grinding advance in Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donetsk Oblast, primarily toward the logistic hub of Pokrovsk, the fall of which would loosen Kyiv&#x2019;s grip on its last controlled cities in the war-torn industrial region. &#x201C;I have no optimistic hopes for Zelensky&apos;s visit to the U.S.,&#x201D; said infantryman Artem with a battalion fighting in northeastern Kharkiv Oblast, another hotspot along the more than 1,000-kilometer front line in Ukraine that lies south of Kursk Oblast and north of Donetsk Oblast. Artem and other soldiers who spoke to the Kyiv Independent aren&apos;t identified by their full name because they didn&apos;t have authorization from their commanders to speak to the press.

(Patryk Jaracz/Anadolu via Getty Images)&#x201C;Maybe we will get a few more shells and missiles, and that&apos;s it,&#x201D; Artem said. &#x201C;In general, I have the impression that the U.S. does not really want us to defeat Russia. We won&apos;t lose, but we won&apos;t be able to win for a long time,&#x201D; Artem added. He quipped that it may be &#x201C;beneficial&#x201D; for the U.S. to exhaust and weaken Russia for several years rather than give Ukraine what it needs to win the war. He warned that this largely static war could continue for several more years as neither side would have the means to achieve a significant breakthrough on the battlefield. To compete against a foe with much more troops and heavy weaponry, Ukraine has so far relied on homemade drones to strike Russian military targets&#x2014;from ammo depots to airfields&#x2014;deep inside Russia. Hoping to boost the firepower and range of such strikes, Zelensky, with his visit, is set to be the latest European leader in the Western alliance backing Kyiv to nudge Washington into a major decision that would allow Ukrainian troops to aim at Russian targets using precise NATO military alliance missiles. Ukraine lacks sufficient manpower and resources to change the tide in the eastern Donbas battlefields, where Russian troops have been in a grinding offensive since October 2023 gradually gaining ground. However, Ukrainian soldiers emphasized that weakening Russia by striking targets in the rears would help Ukraine have a chance at a breakthrough in the war. &#x201C;If we strike at Russia&apos;s rear, then the enemy&apos;s logistics would be depleted, and fewer shells, missiles, equipment, and fuel would be sent to the front from their side,&#x201D; said infantryman Artem, defending the Kupiansk front. &#x201C;This would then affect the strength of Russian units on the contact line.&#x201D; &#x201C;And over time, we could turn this in our favor and launch counteroffensive operations,&#x201D; he added.

(Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu via Getty Images)In a nightly video address on Sept. 21, after a series of long-range drone strikes on Russian weapons depots, Zelensky stressed that &#x201C;the answer to the question of when this war will end lies in the question of when our partners&apos; determination will keep pace with what we can do for our defense, for our independence, for our victory.&#x201D; U.S. President Joe Biden is &#x201C;not ruling out&#x201D; lifting restrictions on Ukraine&#x2019;s use of long-range weapons to strike Russian territory, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Sky News in a September interview. Though Kyiv&#x2019;s &#x201C;victory plan&#x201D; has not been revealed yet, Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi said last week that Zelensky would soon publicly present the proposal that &#x201C;will strengthen Ukraine, Ukrainian warriors, and Ukrainian people.&#x201D; The plan should encompass the complete withdrawal of Moscow&#x2019;s troops from the Russian-occupied territories in Ukraine, which account for nearly 20% of state turf, and compensation for the damage they caused during the war, said infantryman Serhii with the 79th Separate Assault Brigade in Donetsk Oblast. Ukrainian soldiers stressed that they critically needed more ammunition shells, drones, air defense missiles, and even basic transport vehicles. Soldier Artem said that a ramped-up supply of first-person-view (FPV) drones would be critical, as it would help Ukraine compensate for its manpower disadvantage. As the situation on the eastern front line deteriorates daily, Zelensky is due to meet outgoing U.S. president Biden on Sept. 26 at the White House. Zelensky will also hold separate meetings with 2024 presidential candidates Kamala Harris, Biden&#x2019;s vice president and the Democratic party nominee, and hopes to meet Republican candidate Donald Trump, who seeks re-election. &#x201C;The President and Vice President (Harris) will emphasize their unshakeable commitment to stand with Ukraine until it prevails in this war,&#x201D; Biden&apos;s Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a Sept. 19 statement. Trump, in a recent debate with Harris, refused multiple times to confirm whether he sought Ukraine to defeat Russia in its invasion, insisting that under his watch, the war would never have occurred and that knowing both Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin, he could swiftly negotiate a settlement.

(Aaron Schwartz/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Zelensky&#x2019;s visit comes days after UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited Biden urging permission for Ukraine to conduct strikes deep into Russia using Western missiles, including the British-supplied Storm Shadows, which have U.S. components. The Kremlin warned that a decision to lift the restriction would make the West a participant in the conflict. Before departing for the U.S., Zelensky said at a press conference during European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen&apos;s visit to Kyiv on Sept. 20 that he hoped for a quick decision from all Western allies to support his &#x201C;victory plan.&#x201D; He stressed the importance of the U.S. leadership role in providing Kyiv with the support it needs to win the war, which diplomats have told the Kyiv Independent recently has not been felt strongly. The permission to use Western weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia is &#x201C;an important component of future victory,&#x201D; said Oleh, a Ukrainian drone operator deployed in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. Oleh said that this is a war of technology, as it is impossible to compete against Russia with just the manpower in World War I-style trench warfare. &#x201C;For every one of ours, eight Russians must be killed to equalize the mobilization reserve,&#x201D; he added. Stressing that technology will ultimately give Ukraine the upper hand on the battlefield, Oleh said he was optimistic that Zelensky would return home with results. &#x201C;I hope that Zelensky will reach an agreement (with the U.S.), and we will be given more weapons and be allowed to use them as we need, not as they allow us (now),&#x201D; Oleh said.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-zelensky-talks-ukrainian-soldiers-want-more-weaponry-but-question-if-us-wants-russia-defeated/	2024-09-23T13:37:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2160995299.jpg
Japan warns off Russian military plane, uses flares for first time	Japan scrambled fighter jets and used flares to warn off a Russian military plane that breached Japanese airspace on Sept. 23, Japanese Defense Minister Minoru Kihara said. The airspace violation could be related to the joint military exercises Russia and China planned to participate in during September. A Russian Il-38 reconnaissance aircraft entered Japanese airspace over Rebun Island, off Japan&apos;s northern coast, Kihara told reporters. The plane breached Japan&apos;s airspace three times, for up to a minute in each instance, over the course of a five-hour flight in the region. In response, Japan scrambled F-15 and F-35 fighter jets, which used flares after the Russian plane ignored earlier warnings. The incident marks the first time Japanese aircraft used flares to warn off a Russian military plane. &quot;The airspace violation was extremely regrettable,&quot; Kihara said. He also said Japan has lodged a protest with Moscow via diplomatic channels. &quot;We will carry out our warning and surveillance operations as we pay close attention to their military activities,&quot; Kihara said. The Russian plane was not engaged in particularly dangerous activities at the time it entered Japanese airspace, he said. Earlier in September, Russian Il-38 and other military aircraft were detected and tracked in the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) in North America, though the planes stopped short of violating U.S. or Canadian airspace. In July 2024, the U.S. and Canada scrambled fighter jets to intercept Russian and Chinese military planes in the ADIZ.	https://kyivindependent.com/japan-warns-off-russian-military-plane-uses-flares-for-first-time/	2024-09-23T13:32:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1066022208.jpg
Control of US House, Senate is up for grabs. What could down-ballot elections mean for Ukraine support?	The entire U.S. House and some members of the Senate are up for reelection in November &#x2014; including some of Ukraine&#x2019;s staunchest backers in Congress, which could have an impact on future support for Kyiv in its fight against Russia. All 435 members of the House will face re-election on Nov. 5. Voter turnout is expected to be higher than normal given the face-off between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, likely increasing turnout for all congressional district races. While Congressional races aren&#x2019;t typically the focus of international concern, this November&#x2019;s elections could alter the political makeup of key committees and districts that have been reliable in their support of Ukraine. In some races, incumbent Democrats could be unseated by Trump-backed Republicans who oppose America&#x2019;s support for Ukraine. Republicans are slightly favored to retain leadership in the House, according to Inside Elections, an independent political analysis organization, but Democrats are benefitting from momentum and a surge in down-ballot financing following the rallying around Kamala Harris. In some states, early in-person voting is already underway.

(Saul Loeb /AFP via Getty Images)Democrats are also facing what Rep. Jim Costa of California said are strong concerns about efforts from the Kremlin to benefit Trump in the election. &#x201C;The constant effort of Russia today, not just RT, but their various means to infiltrate our election process, to disrupt and favor Trump, is well known and substantial,&#x201D; Rep. Costa said, referencing the state-owned news outlet in Russia that recently had two employees indicted for funding a pro-Russian network in Tennessee. &#x201C;Russia is also trying to impact elections down ballot where they can.&#x201D; For House Republicans, who currently have the majority, 112 representatives who voted &#x2018;no&#x2019; on the $61 billion aid package for Ukraine that was passed in April are up for re-election. Among those are 12 Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Its chairman, on the other hand, Rep. Michael McCaul, is among the more supportive Republicans of Ukraine, having voted yes on the April aid package. House Democrats in support of Ukraine could gain another vote should Foreign Affairs Committee member and Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Scott Perry, lose this November. Perry, who has voted against all significant Ukraine packages lately and is known for his connection to Donald Trump&#x2019;s 2020 election denial, is facing a challenger who has expressed support for Ukraine. &quot;If (Putin is) successful in Ukraine, how much further will he take it?,&quot; the challenger, Janelle Stelson, told a Pennsylvania television station in April. &quot;Will he then start eking into our NATO allies? We don&apos;t know what&apos;s in his mind. But when I see Scott Perry vote against Ukraine and vote for Russia, that&apos;s a real problem for me.&quot; Chair of the House Freedom Caucus Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) speaks during a news conference with members of the House Freedom Caucus at the U.S. Capitol in in Washington, DC, U.S. on Nov.29, 2023.

(Joe Lamberti for The Washington Post via Getty Images)Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican who visited Kyiv on Sept. 13 and serves on the Armed Services Committee, is one of the most adamant Ukraine-supporting conservatives who could lose in November. Rep. Bacon defeated an anti-Ukraine opponent from his right wing in the Republican primary and now must face a general election Democrat in a district won by President Biden in 2020. Nearly two-thirds of Americans support Ukraine in Rep. Bacon&#x2019;s estimates, which is why he said discussing his support of Ukraine is a winning issue in his divided district. In April, 44% of Americans said they were extremely concerned about the possibility of Ukraine being defeated and taken over by Russia. &#x201C;If I happen to lose in November it won&#x2019;t be because of Ukraine,&#x201D; Rep. Bacon told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;I think I would be in a worse spot if I didn&#x2019;t support Ukraine.&#x201D; In Cleveland, Ohio, one of the largest Ukrainian communities in the country, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, the Democratic co-chair of the bipartisan Ukraine Caucus, has faced growing support from the Republican opposition who&#x2019;ve challenged her in previous races. Kaptur, who recently led a bipartisan letter calling for the Biden administration to lift its restrictions on Kyiv&#x2019;s use of American weapons to strike inside Russia, won her last race by 13% but used to be re-elected more handily with a margin near 30%. Knowing that the economy is the number one driver on most voters&#x2019; minds, the reliable advocate for Ukraine hopes that the number of veterans in Ohio who know the realities of war abroad and aid workers who&#x2019;ve helped Ukrainians in Cleveland will show up on election day with foreign policy in mind.

(Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;A lot of Ohioans have come to see &#x2014; they didn&#x2019;t even know where Ukraine was &#x2014; now they&#x2019;re seeing this creeping threat across NATO,&#x201D; Kaptur told the Kyiv Independent. The campaign for Republican Derek Merrin who is facing Kaptur did not respond to requests for comment. When it comes to adamantly vocal opposition to support of Ukraine, Congress&#x2019;s distinct Republicans are Marjorie Taylor Greene in the House and JD Vance in the Senate, Trump&#x2019;s running mate. Greene, the current two-term fringe Georgia representative blamed for spreading Russian propaganda, is among the incumbents that would make Ukraine lobbying easier should she lose in November. The campaign website of her opponent, Shawn Harris, says that America should use all the tools available to manage Russia&#x2019;s threat, including civilian and military aid. However, if Greene&#x2019;s 2022 re-election where she won handily with over 65% of the vote is any indicator, Harris&#x2019;s odds of overthrowing the conspiracy theorist won&#x2019;t be easy. Congress&#x2019;s only Ukraine-born representative, Indiana Republican Victoria Spartz, is one of the incumbent Republicans who voted no on aid to Ukraine in April and could be unseated by a Democrat in November. Deborah Pickett, the Democrat challenging Spartz, said she supports continued aid to Ukraine, according to local reporting in Indiana. Rep. Spartz defeated her Democratic challenger in 2022 by over 50,000 votes, but in 2020 defeated the Democratic opposition by about 17,000 votes. Spartz, who did not respond to requests for comment, was backed by Trump in her successful 2020 primary, representing a sect of the Republican party that many view as voting on policy packages depending on the former president&#x2019;s views. &#x201C;I actually think there&#x2019;s a lot of Republican support on the Hill for Ukraine and to stand up to Russia,&#x201D; a Senate aide who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;But some of these folks are caught in the Trump vice of their own making.&#x201D; (L-R) J.D.

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)In the Senate, where Republicans only need to flip two seats to guarantee control of the chamber, Democrats are likely to see their narrow majority fall to at least a 50-50 split due to the retirement of independent Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. The state&#x2019;s Republican Governor who is expected to win the Senate seat, Jim Justice, has supported previous American aid to Ukraine. However, one of Republican&#x2019;s best chances to win a Senate seat is in Montana, where Democratic Sen. Jon Tester&#x2019;s incumbency is threatened in a state fond of Trump. Tester&#x2019;s &#xA0;Republican challenger, Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL, has called for an end to American involvement in Ukraine, saying the U.S. should focus on its economy. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s time for the United States to end our involvement in this war,&#x201D; Sheehy said in a July 2023 statement. &#x201C;We must now demand a settlement which ends the killing of innocent people and the unlimited supply of arms from the United States.&#x201D; In Ohio, which has become a reliably red state for Trump since 2016, Senate Republicans have another shot at unseating a Democrat with a Trump-backed Ukraine skeptic. Democratic incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown, who has consistently endorsed U.S. aid to Ukraine, faces a well-financed Republican, Bernie Moreno, who told a local news station that the U.S. should not be funding &#x2018;another endless war.&#x2019; There are a number of Republican candidates up for re-election or vying to join the House who align with Trump and thus pose questionable policies for Ukraine, Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, who isn&#x2019;t up for re-election until 2029 but has increasingly been in the public eye after being shortlisted for Harris&#x2019;s running mater said. &#xA0; &#x201C;(At the) same time, I expect that the Democrats win back the House, so after January I think (Democrats) will be in a better position, which means Ukraine will be in a better position,&#x201D; Sen. Kelly said.	https://kyivindependent.com/control-for-the-u-s-house-and-senate-are-up-for-grabs-what-could-down-ballot-races-mean-for-ukraine/	2024-09-23T13:11:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1745431731.jpg
Scholz meets Zelensky, says Germany will not let Kyiv use its weapons on Russian soil	President Volodymyr Zelensky met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sept. 23 on the sidelines of the 79th United Nations General Assembly in New York City. Shortly before the meeting, Scholz reaffirmed Berlin&apos;s refusal to allow Ukraine to use German weapons to strike targets within Russia. &quot;Germany will not lift any restrictions,&quot; Scholz said in response to queries from reporters regarding long-range strikes in Russia. &quot;This does not depend on my personal attitude. We will not do that, and we have good reasons for that.&quot; While the U.S. and U.K. face increasing pressure to lift restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of American ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles in Russia, Germany still refuses to supply Kyiv with long-range Taurus missiles. Scholz said his position would not change even if the U.S. lifts restrictions, and said that Germany aims to &quot;focus on what really helps and what is needed&quot; in terms of supporting Ukraine. &#xA0; Following Scholz&apos;s remarks, Zelensky met with the German chancellor to discusseUkraine&apos;s roadmap to peace and plans for a second global peace summit. &quot;We talked about how to bring a just peace closer. The main thing is to maintain unity,&quot; Zelensky said. &#xA0; The next peace summit will be &quot;a real platform to guarantee the full restoration of security for Ukraine and the whole of Europe,&quot; he said. Zelensky arrived in the U.S. on Sept. 22, kicking off a nearly week-long visit focused on presenting the president&apos;s &quot;victory plan&quot; to Ukraine&apos;s allies, including U.S. President Joe Biden. Zelensky and Biden will meet at the White House on Sept. 26.	https://kyivindependent.com/scholz-meets-zelensky-says-germany-will-not-let-kyiv-use-its-weapons-on-russian-soil/	2024-09-23T12:44:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/scholz.jpg
Denmark contributes $19.5 million to restore Ukraine's energy system	The Danish government has allocated 130 million Danish kroner ($19.5 million) to restore Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure after Russia&apos;s mass attacks, according to the Sept. 23 Denmark Energy Ministry&apos;s statement. Russia launched nine coordinated attacks against Ukraine&apos;s electricity infrastructure between March and August, striking facilities in 20 oblasts. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand. This summer, the power shortage was 2.5 GW when Kyiv was already experiencing long blackouts. Danish Energy Minister Lars Aagaard announced new financial assistance for Ukraine on Sept. 23 in New York during a meeting within the G7 working group on Ukraine&apos;s energy security, which also involved U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, the statement read. Denmark&apos;s new contribution to support Ukraine&apos;s energy system is one of the largest ever made by the country. The funds will be used to implement emergency measures, as well as to purchase equipment and spare parts to restore the security of the energy supply, the ministry said. &quot;Russia is violating the rules of war with its massive attacks on Ukraine&apos;s electricity and heat supply system. As winter approaches, many Ukrainian homes will be left without heat and electricity,&quot; Aagaard said. &quot;In addition, ordinary workers in the energy sector, who are doing their jobs against all odds, are being targeted. We must do everything possible to make the Ukrainian energy system as strong as possible,&quot; he added. In April, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko and Aagaard signed a memorandum on cooperation in bioenergy. The same month, Denmark provided Ukraine with $5.8 million for energy infrastructure. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Danish companies have transferred energy equipment to Ukraine four times through the Danish Energy Agency. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW Kiel), which tracks international aid for Ukraine, Denmark has provided almost $9.5 billion to Ukraine, making it the second largest financial backer as a percentage of GDP.	https://kyivindependent.com/denmark-contributes-19-5-million-to-restore-ukraines-energy-system/	2024-09-23T12:26:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1244704193.jpg
Opinion: Ukraine’s avant-garde legacy battles against persistent destruction	On a recent trip to Kyiv, I was fortunate enough to join a tour of the city led by Olena Zaretska, the granddaughter of the legendary Ukrainian artist and dissident Alla Horska. Horska was part of a generation of young writers, artists, and intellectuals who challenged the repressive cultural atmosphere of Soviet Ukraine in the 1960s and eventually paid a high price for their defiance. Some were banned from working, others imprisoned, and some &#x2013; like Horska &#x2013; murdered by the state. The Soviet Union&#x2019;s violent response to artistic defiance wasn&#x2019;t new in the 1960s. One of Horska&#x2019;s &#x201C;crimes&#x201D; had been to seek out traces of artists and writers purged in the 1930s. She, poet Vasyl Symonenko, and theater director Les Taniuk discovered a mass execution site at Bykivnia, on the outskirts of Kyiv. They knew they had found it when they saw children playing with a skull in the woods. The soil at Bykivnia contained the remains of avant-garde writers Mykhail Semenko and Mike Yohansen, influential artist Mykhailo Boychuk, and many others. Of the trio who made this gruesome discovery in the early 1960s, only Taniuk would survive. Symonenko was beaten to death in 1963, and Horska was murdered in 1970. Horska, Taniuk, and their dissident circle didn&#x2019;t restrict themselves to seeking traces of the dead. In Kyiv in the early 1960s, some leading artists of the 1920s were still alive, holed up in their apartments, all but forgotten. Zaretska&#x2019;s tour group stopped outside an unassuming 1950s housing block in central Kyiv &#x2013; this was the former home of Anatol Petrytskyi, a central figure in the Ukrainian avant-garde of the early 20th century. His work was shown at the Venice Biennale in 1930 and later exhibited in the U.S. Most of his fellow artists, like his close collaborator, theatrical genius Les Kurbas, had been murdered, but Petrytskyi survived. He died in 1964, his post-war career a faint echo of his early success. However, in his final years, he was moved to find himself rediscovered by a new generation once again pushing artistic and political boundaries. &#x201C;He spoke with tears in his eyes,&#x201D; Zaretska told us, standing outside the hip coffee shop that now neighbors Petrytskyi&#x2019;s old home, &#x201C;about the hundreds of works of his that the authorities had simply destroyed.&#x201D; The conversations in Kyiv apartments of the early 1960s, between those repressed under Joseph Stalin and those soon to be beaten under Leonid Brezhnev, are part of a pattern in Ukrainian cultural life. Each generation salvages the works and memory of the previous one, while constantly fending off renewed attacks. This cycle continues today: a groundbreaking exhibition of Horska&#x2019;s work at Kyiv&#x2019;s Ukrainian House Arts Centre took place in early 2024, in defiance of constant Russian air raids. Not long before, stunning murals by Horska, recently rediscovered by contemporary art historians under newer layers of paint and plaster, were destroyed by Russian missile attacks in eastern Ukraine. Regional art museums across Ukraine have been hit by Russian bombs or, as in the case of Kherson, looted by occupying forces. Perhaps one of the most powerful acts of heritage preservation in the face of Russia&#x2019;s war is the exhibition &#x201C;In the Eye of the Storm,&#x201D; which has toured Madrid, Vienna, and Cologne, and is now at London&#x2019;s Royal Academy of Arts. The exhibition features important works of modernist art produced in early 20th-century Ukraine, mostly from Ukrainian collections. In late 2022, they were evacuated in secret by train via Poland, under Russian bombardment. &#x201C;We loaded the trucks with the paintings and sent them on their way with a military convoy and state guarantees instead of insurance,&#x201D; curator Konstantin Akinsha told ArtNews. After narrowly avoiding Russian missiles and navigating border closures, &#x201C;by some miracle, the trucks arrived in Madrid on time for the exhibition.&#x201D; President Volodymyr Zelensky and First Lady Olena Zelenska visit a retrospective exhibition of Ukrainian artis Alla Horska at the Ukrainian House in Kyiv, Ukraine, on April 2, 2024. (Presidency of Ukraine / Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images)The achievements of the team behind the exhibition (curators Akinsha, Katia Denysova, and Olena Kashuba-Volvach, National Art Museum of Ukraine director Yuliya Lytvynets, among others) were not only in preserving the physical works but also in reclaiming their story. After decades of being written out of art history, Ukraine&#x2019;s artistic heritage must be reimagined and reclaimed. The place of Ukrainian cities &#x2013; Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa &#x2013; in the history of European modernism needs to be fully established, and the complex identities of Ukraine&#x2019;s artists recovered. This is difficult, given the dominance of the &#x201C;Russian avant-garde&#x201D; label, which obscures the identities of many artists from the imperial borderlands. Kazymyr Malevych, perhaps the most famous figure in the exhibition and a native of Ukraine, was known to his Polish parents as Kazimierz Malewicz. He worked in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine and was deeply influenced by the Ukrainian context (he even sometimes referred to himself as Ukrainian). Another star of the exhibition, Alexandra Exter, was born in what is today Poland to a Belarusian-Greek family and spent time in Kyiv, Paris, Moscow, and St. Petersburg. &#x201C;In the Eye of the Storm&#x201D; avoids the trap of nationalizing these artists; its subtitle is &#x201C;Modernism in Ukraine,&#x201D; not &#x201C;Ukrainian Modernism.&#x201D; Denysova notes that these artists worked with a &#x201C;twofold agenda&#x201D;: to assert Ukraine&#x2019;s cultural autonomy while also engaging with international artistic trends. The exhibition also highlights important, yet often neglected, cultural dialogues within Ukraine. The brief period of Ukrainian independence after 1917 was a time of cultural rebirth not only for Ukrainians but also for Ukraine&#x2019;s Jews. While Ukrainian artists founded the Ukrainian Academy of Arts, Ukraine&#x2019;s Jews created the Kultur Lige, an artistic organization aiming to forge a new Jewish culture for the modern world. &#x201C;In the Eye of the Storm&#x201D; emphasizes this connection between these movements by juxtaposing two large canvases: Anatol Petrytskyi&#x2019;s &#x201C;The Invalids&#x201D; (1924), depicting a family of disabled beggars, and Manuil Shekhtman&#x2019;s &#x201C;Jewish Pogrom&#x201D; (1926), portraying a Jewish family recovering from one of the many anti-Jewish pogroms in Ukraine. The striking similarity in the bold scale, powerful figurative work, and deep empathy of the pieces reflects their shared roots. Petrytskyi and Shekhtman studied together at the Kyiv Art School in the 1910s; their teachers there later helped found the Ukrainian Academy of Art. The influence of one of those teachers, Mykhailo Boichuk, who famously synthesized Ukrainian Byzantine iconography with modernist aesthetics, can be seen clearly in the stylized figures of Shekhtmen&#x2019;s grieving pogrom victims. Neither the Ukrainian Academy of Arts nor the Kultur Lige lasted long; both were absorbed into Soviet institutions within a few years of the Bolshevik takeover of Ukraine, and both modernist projects were annihilated by Stalin&#x2019;s purges. In the 1930s, hundreds of writers, theater directors, and artists were labeled bourgeois nationalists and executed. Many more were imprisoned, and their manuscripts, books, and artworks destroyed.

(Dmytro Bartosh/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Symbolic of this destruction is one of the most striking paintings in the Royal Academy exhibition: Petrytskyi&#x2019;s portrait of futurist poet Semenko, who was shot by the NKVD in 1937 and buried in an unmarked grave at Bykivnia. The portrait was part of a series of one hundred images that Petrytskyi made of leading figures of the Ukrainian avant-garde movement. The fate of this series is a microcosm of the tragedy of cultural life in early 20th century Ukraine: only nineteen of the original one hundred survived. It is difficult to maintain artistic institutions in regions under the control of aggressive empires, but Ukraine&#x2019;s artistic legacy has repeatedly fought back and thrived despite every colonial assault by Russia. This multi-generational salvage operation ensures that art lovers worldwide can appreciate Ukrainian modernism. Yet the story of survival is inseparable from the story of destruction. The joy of seeing Petrytskyi&#x2019;s work in London is tempered by the knowledge that many of his works were lost forever. Similarly, the thrill of seeing Horska exhibited in Kyiv is overshadowed by the destruction of her murals in Donetsk by Russian shelling. Ukraine&#x2019;s lost avant-garde artworks could fill an exhibition space far larger than the one at the Royal Academy. The storm, clearly, is not over.

Ukraine war latest: Kyiv hits over 200 military targets in Russia using drones within a year	Key developments on Sept. 23: Ukraine has destroyed or damaged over 200 military facilities in Russia over the past year using &quot;drone swarm&quot; technology, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov wrote in an opinion piece for Forbes Ukraine published on Sept. 23. &quot;Today, Ukrainian drones fly over 1,000 kilometers (623 miles), reaching Murmansk and the Volga region, destroying Russian oil refineries and airfields,&quot; Umerov wrote. Among the targets of Ukrainian forces were control centers, airfields, ships, air defense systems, and Russian military bases, the minister added. According to the minister, Ukraine has increased its long-range military capabilities &quot;several times&quot; this year. Particularly, in 2024, the Defense Ministry contracted drones worth over Hr 21 billion ($507.6 million) in total and ammunition for drones worth Hr 9 billion ($217.5 million). Recent Ukrainian drone attacks have forced Russia to relocate its aircraft to airfields 250 kilometers (156 miles) from the Ukrainian-Russian border, Umerov said. The Ukrainian military has proven to be a pioneer in drone technology, using innovative ways to undermine Russia&apos;s ammunition and personnel advantage. Aerial drones have been used to ram into Russian helicopters or drop molten metal on ground positions, while naval drones were a key component in upending Russia&apos;s dominance in the Black Sea. In recent months, Ukraine has increased the number of large-scale attacks on Russian territory. Ukraine has used over 100 drones in a number of its recent strikes against Russia. On Sept. 18, Ukrainian drones attacked one of the largest arsenals in Russia, causing a powerful detonation in the town of Toropets in Russia&apos;s Tver Oblast, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. Ukraine&apos;s attack on the arms depot in Russia&apos;s Tver Oblast destroyed two to three months&apos; worth of munitions, according to the Estonian Defense Forces Intelligence Center. The next few months will be &quot;decisive&quot; in Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 23, as he begins his nearly week-long trip to the U.S. Speaking at the American Academy of Achievement award ceremony in Washington D.C., Zelensky urged Ukraine&apos;s allies to act faster and &quot;define what the outcome (of the war) will be.&quot; &quot;We don&apos;t have much time,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;The next few months will be decisive. Ahead of us in this war &#x2014; Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, and all of you because this is Russia&apos;s war against freedom itself &#x2014; we are short of time to define what the outcome will be. &quot;And we must define it. Not Russia, not their bloody allies. We need to be faster. We need not to lose the next few months in war, so that we don&apos;t lose the next decades.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s remarks came as he began his trip to the U.S. where he will present his &quot;victory plan&quot; to U.S. President Joe Biden, as well as to presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris and members of Congress. He will also attend the U.N. General Assembly in New York and meet other world leaders. Zelensky will present his &quot;victory plan&quot; as Ukraine holds territories in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, though Moscow keeps on pushing on multiple fronts in the country&apos;s east. Ukraine said it is open to suggestions from Washington to strengthen the plan. U.S. officials said they had been acquainted with elements of Zelensky&apos;s strategy and voiced belief &quot;that (it) can work.&quot; Zelensky said the plan was designed to end the war with the backing of international partners without relying on Russia&apos;s cooperation. However, he did not specify how it would achieve this. &quot;This must be our shared achievement &#x2014; victory for freedom, with no compromises at freedom&apos;s expense,&quot; the president said. At the American Academy of Achievement award ceremony, Zelensky received the Golden Plate Award in recognition of contributions to human development. Ukraine&apos;s 95th Separate Polissia Air Assault Brigade said on Sept. 23 it had broken through another section of the Russian border. The brigade published a video purporting to show the breakthrough of engineering barriers, the crossing of airborne assault units into Russia, and the first battles near the border. The exact location and time of the attack were not disclosed, but the brigade said it was &quot;the second successful operation to break through the Russian border since the beginning of the operation in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast.&quot; Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, seizing around 100 settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles). Over past weeks, Russia launched a counterattack in Kursk Oblast, which was halted on Sept. 18, according to the Ukrainian military. One of the objectives of Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Kursk Oblast was to force Russia to redeploy its forces from the front in Ukraine, primarily from the Pokrovsk sector. Moscow has moved about 40,000 Russian soldiers to Kursk Oblast as of Sept. 19, Zelensky said. The Netherlands is still looking for partner countries to provide components for a Patriot air defense system pledged to Ukraine, Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said in an interview with the Delfi media outlet published on Sept. 23. In June, the Netherlands announced that it would provide radar and launch components, and that it had found another unnamed country to provide the additional necessary parts to make up a complete system. But earlier this month it was reported the unnamed country had backed out of the agreement. In the interview with Delfi, Brekelmans said the Netherlands was &quot;trying to find other elements that are necessary to complete the system.&quot; &quot;And there are several countries that are also very eager to help Ukraine,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;They are doing everything they can. But they have encountered some problems that make it impossible to assemble this system.&quot; Brekelmans confirmed that the Netherlands provided Kyiv with a radar system and that three launchers would be delivered &quot;very soon.&quot; Kyiv has been calling on its partners to provide additional air defense assets as Russia intensifies its strikes against cities and energy infrastructure. Ukraine has received at least three Patriot systems from Germany and one from the U.S. Other countries, like the Netherlands and Spain, delivered individual launchers or missiles. The U.S. and the Netherlands also pledged in June to deliver one additional system each. Romania will transfer a Patriot to Ukraine too after the donation was finally approved in early September.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-next-few-months-will-be-decisive-in-russias-full-scale-war-zelensky-says/	2024-09-23T11:27:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-18-at-19_35_24.png
Iranian president says his country doesn't support Moscow as Tehran allegedly transfers ballistic missiles to Russia	Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian claimed on Sept. 23 on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York that his country had never supported Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine and denied supplying ballistic missiles to Russia, the Guardian reported. Washington confirmed on Sept. 10 earlier media reports that Russia had received shipments of Iranian Fath-360 close-range ballistic missiles. A day prior, Iran denied it had delivered ballistic missiles to Russia, claiming the ongoing reports were &quot;psychological warfare.&quot; &quot;We are willing to sit down with the Europeans and the Americans to have a dialogue and negotiations. We have never approved of Russian aggression against Ukrainian territory,&quot; Pezeshkian claimed in New York. Pezeshkian became the country&apos;s president on Aug. 30, 2024. During his first press conference after taking office he also denied supplying ballistic missiles to Russia. &quot;There may have been such deliveries in the past. But I can assure you that there have been no such deliveries to Russia since I took office,&quot; Pezeshkian said. Ukraine, the E.U., and the U.S. introduced more sanctions against Iran in the wake of the confirmation of the missile delivery to Russia. The confirmation of the deliveries marked a &quot;further escalation of Iran&apos;s military support to Russia&apos;s war of aggression against Ukraine,&quot; the U.K., France, and Germany said in their Sept. 10 joint statement. Russia and Iran have deepened their military and political cooperation since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Ukraine launches online marriages to unite couples separated by war	The wedding of Olha Shevchenko and Mykyta Pukhkan earlier this September was unique. It was online. The couple was among the first to marry using a Ukrainian-developed Diia mobile application. &#x201C;One day in May, my husband saw a notification about the beta version in Diia, which offered an online wedding service. It looked a little unusual... But we risked it,&#x201D; Shevchenko told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;We were planning to get married. Maybe not this year, maybe not with the current situation in the country, but we did.&#x201D; Dubbed &quot;the country in the smartphone,&quot; the Diia mobile app was launched by the Digital Transformation Ministry in 2020. As of early August, it included some 130 services and is used by more than 20 million Ukrainians, according to the officials. People can access various official documents, including their passport, driver&apos;s license, or vehicle registration. It is also allows to skip queues and register a business, or pay taxes within a few clicks. Another service, officially marrying, was added this September after several months of testing, with Ukraine becoming the first country to have such a practice fully digitalized.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)Ukrainians can apply, propose, and get married online by choosing a place and date. To do this, a couple can be in the same place or hundreds of kilometers apart. Shevchenko and Pukhkan, both in their 20s, were sitting in a cafe in the town of Izmail in southern Odesa Oblast when they became newlyweds within a few minutes. Looking at their phone screens, they listened to the registrar conducting the ceremony via video and then put a digital signature to confirm the marriage. &#x201C;The ceremony was perfect. Even though there was an air raid alert and a power outage all day,&#x201D; Shevchenko said. According to the Digital Transformation Ministry, as of Sept. 20, 251 couples had gotten married in Diia, and 3,200 had applied for marriage online. Almost 830,000 proposals were recorded, with 106,000 people saying &#x201C;yes.&#x201D; &#x201C;This service is unique. Some countries have tried to test similar services, and some states have implemented them in the U.S. However, such a comprehensive service, which completely closes the entire (marriage) cycle online and then generates a document, the original of which can be received at the post office, is a unique feature,&#x201D; Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said on national television. Legalizing online marriage in Ukraine came out of necessity. Since the start of the full-scale war, nearly a million people have been defending the country. After Russia launched its full-scale invasion, the number of marriages in Ukraine hit 222,890 in 2022, outpacing the previous two years, according to the Justice Ministry. But in 2023, the number of marriages dropped to 186,051, and divorces increased. Over the past 10 years, the number of new families in Ukraine has decreased by 1.6 times, according to the Opendatabot monitoring service. Olga Shevchenko and Mykyta Pukhkan are using a mobile app for a wedding ceremony in the town of Izmail in Odesa Oblast, Ukraine, on Sept. 5, 2024. (Anastasia Tikhneva/Personal archive)Following the start of an all-out war, Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament simplified the marriage procedure during martial law by allowing military personnel to marry remotely. Through the app, soldiers can now get married to their loved ones while on the front line. &#x201C;For Ukrainians, this is no time for tons of bureaucracy,&#x201D; Vitalii Tsariuk told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;And if at least marriages are available online, then it&apos;s even better because there are many people who are far away, who can&apos;t come here and now.&#x201D; However, as getting married is simplified for some, for others it remains an unachievable goal. Tsariuk and his partner Viktor applied for marriage as soon as the demo version of the online proposal feature was launched in February 2023. They knew that it would not be approved, but Tsariuk saw this step as another opportunity to remind society about the need to pass legislation to legalize same-sex marriages. Same-sex marriage is illegal in Ukraine and a bill to recognize civil partnerships as an alternative has been stuck in parliament since last year due to opposition from lawmakers. Allowing civil partnerships would provide the LGBTQ+ community with a number of rights that are now available only to heterosexual couples. Among them is the right to allow the partner to receive the body for burial in case of death. With Ukrainian soldiers under fire and the country&#x2019;s cities pounded by Russian missiles, such a right is the most pressing. &#x201C;If people are not interested in this topic, they do not know. And if we do not tell them, they will not know. Therefore, it is not even about homophobia, it is more about making people more aware,&#x201D; he said. At present, Ukrainian LGBTQ+ couples cannot apply for marriage in the state app, facing an &#x201C;error&#x201D; and a demand to be a man and a woman. But they can propose to their partners, a feature that some couples have taken to show their love to one another. &#x201C;Diia is basically ready to register same-sex couples, and Diia, like all of us, is just waiting for the adoption of laws that allow same-sex couples to do so,&#x201D; Tsariuk joked.

Telegram to disclose to authorities phone numbers, IP addresses of those who violate messenger's rules	The Telegram messenger app will disclose to the authorities the phone numbers and IP addresses of those who violate its terms of use and privacy policy, Telegram CEO Pavel Durov said on Sept. 23, introducing the latest updates. Personal information will be provided to the authorities by &quot;valid legal requests,&quot; Durov added. The Telegram update comes after Durov&apos;s detention and subsequent arrest in France in late August. Durov is charged with numerous offenses related to his social network, including allowing &#xA0;terrorism, drug trafficking, fraud, money laundering, and child abuse content on the app. The founder of the messaging app faces up to 20 years in prison. Public channels and bots can be found on Telegram, but this feature is abused by people who sell illegal goods. Therefore, in the messenger app, a &quot;special team of moderators, using artificial intelligence,&quot; made all the &quot;problematic content&quot; in the search inaccessible, Durov said. &quot;Telegram search is designed to find friends and news, not to promote illegal products. We won&apos;t allow malicious actors to jeopardize the integrity of our platform for nearly a billion users,&quot; the statement read. The 39-year-old Telegram CEO and co-founder was detained at Le Bourget airport in France on Aug. 24. Durov was later charged and released under judicial control but without the right to leave the country. Following Durov&apos;s arrest and release on bail worth five million euros ($5.5 million), Telegram began cooperating with the country&apos;s investigative authorities, French media Liberation reported on Sept. 10. Durov, whose net worth is estimated at $15.5 billion, left Russia in 2014 after refusing to comply with government demands to shut down opposition channels on the Russian social media platform VK, which he subsequently sold. Durov has claimed he is a pariah and has been effectively exiled from Russia, but on Aug. 27, it was reported he had visited Russia over 60 times since leaving the country, according to Kremlingram, a Ukrainian group that campaigns against the use of Telegram in Ukraine. Telegram remains one of the most popular social media platforms among Ukrainians. A September 2023 poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology indicated that 44% of Ukrainians use Telegram to receive information and news. Ukraine&apos;s National Coordination Center for Cybersecurity on Sept. 20 restricted the use of the Telegram messenger app for government agencies, military, and critical infrastructure facilities. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, earlier called the messenger app &quot;harmful&quot; and a &quot;threat to our national security.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/telegram-to-disclose-to-authorities-phone-numbers-ip-addresses-of-those-who-violate-messengers-rules/	2024-09-23T09:22:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168240257.jpg
Lithuania signs memorandum with one of world's leading arms manufacturers on medium-caliber ammunition	Lithuania has signed a memorandum with American Northrop Grumman Corporation, one of the leading global aerospace and defense technology companies, to produce and supply medium-caliber ammunition, the Lithuanian Defense Ministry said on Sept. 23. Since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, the EU states have been making efforts to ramp up their weaponry production to backfill Ukraine&apos;s needs on the battlefield and strengthen their own arsenals due to a potential Russian threat. The memorandum was signed by Lithuanian Defense Minister Laurynas Kasciunas, Lithuanian Finance Minister Gintare Skaiste, and Northrop Grumman Corporation&apos;s Vice President Steve O&apos;Bryan, according to the statement. The Lithuanian authorities said they expect the ammunition production project with Northrop Grumman could bring &quot;significant&quot; U.S. investment to the country. &quot;This project will be another important step forward in developing Lithuania&apos;s defense industry. We hope that the cooperation with our American allies will strengthen the country&apos;s security and preparedness while also benefiting the wider region, including Ukraine,&quot; Skaiste said. Lithuania remains the largest purchaser of U.S. arms among the Baltic States. The average value of the Lithuanian Defense Ministry&apos;s arms purchases from the U.S. amounts to nearly 1.3 billion euros ($1.4 billion) over the medium term. This represents one-fifth of all planned defense acquisitions, the statement read. Lithuania signed a deal with another arms company, Germany&apos;s Rheinmetall, in June to build a domestic ammunition plant. The project&apos;s investment is more than 180 million euros (around $195 million). Apart from strengthening the Lithuanian defense sector, the new plant is expected to create at least 150 jobs, according to Lithuanian Economy and Innovation Minister Ausrine Armonaite. Previously, Rheinmetall said it would also build an artillery factory in Ukraine, along with facilities dedicated to the production of military vehicles, gunpowder, and anti-aircraft weapons. During the Munich Security Conference in February, Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger signed a memorandum of intent with then-Ukraine&apos;s Strategic Industries Minister Alexander Kamyshin to produce artillery shells in another joint plant based in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-signs-memorandum-with-one-of-worlds-leading-arms-manufacturers-on-medium-caliber-ammunition/	2024-09-23T08:32:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2136562481.jpg

Crimean Bridge ‘must come down,’ Ukraine says at Hague international court	Ukraine has said the Crimean Bridge &quot;must come down&quot; as it accused Russia of flouting maritime laws at an international court in the Hague on Sept. 23. Speaking at the Permanent Court of Arbitration, Ambassador-at-Large at the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, Anton Korynevych, said Russia &quot;wants to take the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait for itself.&quot; &quot;So it has built a great gate at their entrance, to keep international shipping out while allowing small Russian river vessels in,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;The bridge is unlawful, and it must come down.&quot; Ukraine began proceedings at the court in 2016 when Russia began construction of the Crimean Bridge to link the occupied peninsula with the Russian mainland. Kyiv says it was built deliberately low to the water in order to keep out international shipping. The structure became a critical supply route for Russian forces after the launch of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The bridge was heavily damaged by Ukrainian strikes in October 2022 and July 2023, prompting Russia to take steps to further defend the structure. &quot;Russia now views the Kerch Strait, the Sea of Azov, and perhaps even parts of the Black Sea, as its proprietary waters,&quot; Korynevych said. &quot;Russia wants these waters to be viewed as part of its 21st century empire. &#xA0;And while you will hear Russia&#x2019;s experts say the Sea of Azov is similar to a lake or a river, Ukraine does not accept this, and neither should this Tribunal,&quot; he added. Russia&apos;s representative at the court, Gennady Kuzmin, said the claims are &quot;simply wrong.&quot; International arbitration cases can take years to resolve, and a judgment in the case is not expected anytime soon. Last month Kyiv&apos;s Military Intelligence Chief Kyrylo Budanov said Ukraine is working on a &quot;complex solution&quot; that could destroy the bridge in the coming months. Speaking to national TV, he said &quot;work is ongoing&quot; to take out the structure which connects the Russian mainland with the peninsula, and has been a crucial supply route for the Russian military in Ukraine. &quot;Everyone is working on long-range strikes and (the destruction of the Crimean bridge),&quot;he said in comments reported by Ukrinform. &quot;All this requires, let&apos;s say, a complex solution.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Navy said in June that destroying the Kerch Bridge in occupied Crimea would not have the same effect now because Russia barely uses it for military purposes anymore. Vasyl Maliuk, head of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), did not rule out that Russia may try to use the structure for weapons supplies again after it is fully restored.	https://kyivindependent.com/crimean-bridge-must-come-down-ukraine-says-at-the-hague/	2024-09-23T06:23:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1243954958.jpeg
1 person killed, 10 injured after Russian attacks on Donetsk Oblast	Russian forces attacked the city of Kramatorsk and the village of Shakhove in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 23, killing one person and injuring at least 10 others, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Seven people including two children were wounded in the strike on Shakhove in the Pokrovsk district, Filashkin said in a post on Telegram. The attack damaged 24 houses, three administrative buildings and a social institution. Earlier in the day, Russian forces attacked Kramatorsk, a front-line city that has repeatedly suffered deadly strikes. The attack killed a 45-year-old woman and injured three other people, Filashkin said. Over the past day, Russian attacks against Ukraine killed three people and injured 38, according to local authorities.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-on-donetsk-oblast/	2024-09-23T05:54:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2024-09-23_14-36-25.jpg
Netherlands struggling to complete Patriot system pledged to Ukraine, defense minister says	The Netherlands is still looking for partner countries to provide components for a Patriot air defense system pledged to Ukraine, Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said in an interview with the Delfi media outlet published on Sept. 23. In June, the Netherlands announced that it would provide radar and launch components, and that it had found another unnamed country to provide the additional necessary parts to make up a complete system. But earlier this month it was reported the unnamed country had backed out of the agreement. In the interview with Delfi, Brekelmans said the Netherlands was &quot;trying to find other elements that are necessary to complete the system.&quot; &quot;And there are several countries that are also very eager to help Ukraine,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;They are doing everything they can. But they have encountered some problems that make it impossible to assemble this system.&quot; Brekelmans confirmed that the Netherlands provided Kyiv with a radar system and that three launchers would be delivered &quot;very soon.&quot; Kyiv has been calling on its partners to provide additional air defense assets as Russia intensifies its strikes against cities and energy infrastructure. Ukraine has received at least three Patriot systems from Germany and one from the U.S. Other countries, like the Netherlands and Spain, delivered individual launchers or missiles. The U.S. and the Netherlands also pledged in June to deliver one additional system each. Romania will transfer a Patriot to Ukraine too after the donation was finally approved in early September.	https://kyivindependent.com/netherlands-to-sent-3-patriot-launchers-to-ukraine-soon-defense-minister-says/	2024-09-23T05:17:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1242099925-1671654146aso5t.jpg
Next few months will be 'decisive,' Zelensky says during speech in US, urges allies to act faster	The next few months will be &quot;decisive&quot; in Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 23, as he begins his nearly week-long trip to the U.S. Speaking at the American Academy of Achievement award ceremony in Washington D.C., Zelensky urged Ukraine&apos;s allies to act faster and &quot;define what the outcome [of the war] will be.&quot; &quot;We don&apos;t have much time,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;The next few months will be decisive. Ahead of us in this war &#x2014; Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, and all of you because this is Russia&apos;s war against freedom itself &#x2014; we are short of time to define what the outcome will be. &quot;And we must define it. Not Russia, not their bloody allies. We need to be faster. We need not to lose the next few months in war, so that we don&apos;t lose the next decades.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s remarks came as he began his trip to the U.S. where he will present his &quot;victory plan&quot; to President Joe Biden, as well as to presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris and members of Congress. He will also attend the U.N. General Assembly in New York and meet other world leaders.

Ukraine said it is open to suggestions from Washington to strengthen the plan. U.S. officials said they had been acquainted with elements of Zelensky&apos;s strategy and voiced belief &quot;that (it) can work.&quot; Zelensky said the plan was designed to end the war with the backing of international partners without relying on Russia&apos;s cooperation. However, he did not specify how it would achieve this. &quot;This must be our shared achievement &#x2014; victory for freedom, with no compromises at freedom&apos;s expense,&quot; the president said.

Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 3, injure 38 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed three people and injured 38 over the past day, regional authorities said on Sept. 23. Ukrainian forces downed three out of four Shahed-type drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. One more drone and two Kh-59/69 cruise missiles &quot;failed to reach their targets&quot; due to electronic warfare. A Russian overnight attack on the city of Zaporizhzhia injured at least 17 people, including a 15-year-old boy, the Interior Ministry said. Russia launched at least seven guided aerial bombs, which resulted in a partial destruction of an apartment building, according to Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Ivan Fedorov.

Relations with Russia should be reconsidered after war in Ukraine, Macron says	Relations with Russia should be reconsidered after Moscow&#x2019;s full-scale war against Ukraine is over, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Sept. 22. Speaking at an event in Paris, the French president urged people to imagine &quot;tomorrow&apos;s peace&quot; in Europe in a new form, and in a new reality. &quot;We will have to think about a new form of organization of Europe and rethink our relations with Russia after the war in Ukraine,&quot; Macron said. In the early months of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Macron was criticized over his calls to avoid &quot;the humiliation&quot; of Russia, but later he hardened his stance. Paris has since delivered to Ukraine a number of long-range SCALP missiles, and Macron announced in February a coalition to supply Kyiv with &quot;medium- and long-range missiles and bombs.&quot; Another of Macron&apos;s initiatives, sending military instructors to Ukraine, has reportedly been supported by some countries but so far seen no development. The French president said that building a new international order is &quot;the biggest challenge&quot; and that today it is &quot;incomplete and unfair.&quot; &quot;We need an order where some countries cannot block others, and where countries are represented with dignity, and therefore this should be done in much fairer bodies, such as the U.N., the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund,&quot; Macron added. As Russia has become more isolated since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, and has increasingly depleted its preexisting supplies of military equipment, it has deepened its ties with China, Iran and North Korea. Yet, some Western countries, such as Hungary and Slovakia, suggested that they should be prepared for normalization of relations with Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-2/	2024-09-23T02:34:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1238300008.jpg
Russian sleeper cell plotting 'violent seizure of power in Odesa' thwarted, SBU claims	A &quot;combat group&quot; operating under Russian orders has been neutralized while preparing &quot;a violent seizure of power in Odesa,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s State Security Service (SBU) said on Sept. 23. In a post on Telegram, the SBU said the group had originally planned to seize administrative buildings and state institutions in the city at the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It said that once Moscow&apos;s invasion faltered, the group was instead instructed by Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB) to lie low and await further instructions. It was then reactivated over the summer but was exposed by the SBU shortly after. A picture released by the SBU on Sept. 23 showing some of the equipment seized during the operation (SBU/Telegram)The SBU said the leader of the group &#x2014; a 49-year-old man who previously lived in Crimea and moved to Odesa after Russia&apos;s illegal annexation of the peninsula in 2014 &#x2014; and his &quot;right-hand man&quot; had been detained. It said during the operation it had discovered &quot;70 firearms with optical sights and ammunition, as well as body armor, helmets, ballistic goggles and other tactical equipment.&quot; According to the SBU, the leader of the group had managed to recruit &quot;more than two dozen&quot; people. &quot;Currently, all of them are under investigation, and comprehensive measures are underway to bring them to justice for crimes against Ukraine,&quot; the SBU added. If found guilty they face up to 10 years in prison.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-sleeper-cell-plotting-violent-seizure-of-power-in-odesa-thwarted-sbu-claims/	2024-09-23T02:02:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2024-09-23-11_53_36.jpeg
Opinion: Peace in Ukraine will come through Putin’s fall, not a battlefield breakthrough	With Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s war of aggression against Ukraine now well into its third year, there are mounting questions about whether any sort of peace or victory is possible. Much depends, of course, on how one defines those terms. For Putin, the explicitly stated objective is to eliminate Ukraine as an independent nation-state and subject it to Russian control. Yet after two and a half years and a massive mobilization of military resources and manpower, Russia controls only around 18% of Ukraine&#x2019;s territory, and most of that was grabbed back in 2014. Set against Putin&#x2019;s war aims, the invasion has been a miserable failure. Could this change? For a Russian victory to be even remotely possible, the West would need to end all forms of support &#x2013; financial as well as military &#x2013; to Ukraine, and the Ukrainian people would need to lose their will to resist. Absent either &#x2013; or probably both &#x2013; of these outcomes, Putin&#x2019;s war aim seems unachievable. There are no signs of a loss of will on the Ukrainians&#x2019; part. While a minority of respondents in opinion polls say they could accept some territorial concessions as a price for ending the war, these losses would fall far short of anything that would eliminate Ukraine from the map. The many billions of dollars that have been flowing into Ukraine from Europe, the United States, and elsewhere have been crucial, and there are indeed questions about whether such support would continue if former U.S. President Donald Trump retakes the White House in November. But one must remember that the even larger sums coming from the European Union represent little more than 0.3% of GDP for each member state, on average. With no sign that Europeans&#x2019; political will is weakening, this support could perhaps be increased if necessary. Moreover, Europe&#x2019;s production of ammunition is expanding, with projections that output will reach two million artillery rounds next year. Russia, meanwhile, seems to be struggling to increase production, and has become increasingly reliant on ammunition from North Korea. A damaged statue of former Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin stands in front of a building damaged during Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in Sudzha, Kursk Oblast, on Aug. 16, 2024. (Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)This is part of a larger pattern. The Russian military has consistently failed to pull off any successful large-scale offensive operations since the first weeks of the war. Though they have certainly tried &#x2013; setting their sights on Kharkiv this summer &#x2013; they have failed time and again. The bulk of Russian advances have been made by pulverizing smaller cities. To be sure, the Ukrainian army has had its challenges. It succeeded in pushing Russia back around Kherson and Kharkiv in 2022, but then its highly anticipated counteroffensive in the summer of 2023 failed spectacularly. Still, the sudden offensive into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast last month has demonstrated new and impressive capabilities, as well as reminding the world of the Ukrainian forces&#x2019; sheer grit and adaptability. As matters stand, however, the Ukrainian army appears to have little chance of retaking the territory that Russia has occupied. It might well repeat the success of the Kursk operation somewhere along the front lines, which would have important political implications; but achieving sustained results beyond that will be challenging. As long as Putin and his inner circle believe that they can grind down the will of the Ukrainians and their Western backers, they will continue the war. But when it dawns on them that this will not happen, and that Russia is on a path of increasingly rapid decline, things will change. Though it probably won&#x2019;t happen this year, it is not unlikely in 2025. Then, perhaps, one can envisage some sort of interim arrangement that ends the fighting, albeit without delivering &#x201C;victory&#x201D; to either side. A lasting peace, however, is a more challenging prospect. I do not think it will be possible until two conditions are met. First, Putin would have to lose power. He controls the Kremlin and Russian society with an iron grip, and he is far too wedded to his imperial obsession ever to accept a real peace. Second, Ukraine&#x2019;s future must be firmly secured by membership in the EU and reliable Western security arrangements. Then, and only then, might peace be possible. Such an outcome would be a victory not only for Ukraine, but also for Russia. Freed from self-destructive imperial projects, it could finally start to work on becoming a normal, prosperous twenty-first-century nation-state. Editor&#x2019;s Note: Copyright, Project Syndicate.

Ukrainian forces break through another section of Russian border, 95th Brigade claims	Editor&apos;s note: This is a breaking story is being updated. Ukraine&apos;s 95th Separate Polesian Air Assault Brigade said on Sept. 23 it had broken through another section of the Russian border. The brigade published a video purporting to show the breakthrough of engineering barriers, the crossing of airborne assault units into Russia, and the first battles near the border. The location and time of the attack were not disclosed. &quot;This is the second successful operation to break through the Russian border since the beginning of the operation in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast,&quot; the brigade said.

Ukraine's 79th brigade releases video of 'massive' Russian attack being repelled near Kurakhove	Ukraine&apos;s 79th Tavrian Air Assault Brigade said on Sept. 22 it had repelled a &quot;massive&quot; Russian assault in the Kurakhove sector in Donetsk Oblast. Russia is carrying out intense attacks in multiple sections of the eastern front, with attempts to break through Ukraine&apos;s defenses in Donetsk Oblast toward the towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. Ukrainian troops fended off 28 attacks in the Kurakhove sector over the past day alone, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said in its latest update on Sept. 23. Russian forces tried to break through lines near the village of Kostiantynivka, the 79th brigade said, sharing footage showing the assault. The attack reportedly involved 20 pieces of equipment, including 14 armored vehicles with infantry and six tanks. 0:00/1&#xD7;The footage shared on Sept. 23, 2024, showing Ukrainian forces repelling a Russian assault in the Kurakhove sector. (The 79th Tavrian Air Assault Brigade/Telegram)The brigade said it spotted the Russian convoy in advance, and used artillery, drones, and anti-tank missiles to repel the assault. According to the statement, Ukraine&apos;s paratroopers damaged one Russian tank, destroyed two others as well as two Russian armored vehicles carrying troops. &quot;Another vehicle managed to make a shameful escape,&quot; the brigade said, adding: &quot;Our strike drone operators arranged a spectacular safari for dismounted Russian infantry.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. The Ukrainian military said that as of Sept. 12 Russian troops were pushing toward Kurakhove from three directions, but their advance has slowed down. While there are signs of stabilization near Pokrovsk, the focal point of the Russian offensive in Donetsk Oblast, Moscow&apos;s troops have recently ramped up their offensive near Vuhledar, the mining town that lies around 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of occupied Donetsk and around 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-79th-brigade-says-it-repelled-massive-russian-attack-near-kurakhove/	2024-09-22T23:30:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/--------------2024-09-23-084523.png
Russia's global chess ban upheld, move hailed as 'a victory for Ukraine'	The chess teams of Russia and Belarus are to remain banned from international competitions, the International Chess Federation (FIDE) ruled on Sept. 22. Both countries were excluded from the federation in the wake of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. FIDE barred Russian and Belarusian flags from its events, but allowed players from Russia and Belarus to participate under the neutral FIDE flag. During a meeting of the FIDE general assembly in Budapest on Sept. 22, 66 countries voted to support a last-minute proposal to consult the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow some Russian and Belarusian disabled and junior teams to participate in international chess events. The delegates of 41 countries voted not to admit players at all, 21 voted to lift the ban entirely, and 27 abstained or were absent. Those in support of the ban point to the fact Russia&apos;s chess federation is closely intertwined with its government and military &#x2013; ex-Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov are both board members. The FIDE Council now has the final say on a decision but is not expected to overturn the result. Speaking to the BBC the head of the English Chess Federation Malcolm Pein described the vote as a &quot;crushing defeat&quot; for Russia. The Ukrainian Chess Federation&apos;s Viktor Kapustin said the result was a &quot;victory for Ukraine.&quot; &quot;Russia is an aggressor and invader, and the aggressor must be punished in all spheres of their life, including sport. It&apos;s important to keep the sanctions, or even strengthen them. For them to recognise their crimes,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-global-chess-ban-upheld-move-hailed-as-a-victory-for-ukraine/	2024-09-22T23:03:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1294495770.jpg

Zelensky visits Pennsylvania ammunition plant to thank workers	President Volodymyr Zelensky visited a Pennsylvania ammunition factory under tight security on Sept. 22 to personally thank the workers producing some of the most crucial munitions for Ukraine&#x2019;s defense against Russian forces. Rep. Matt Cartwright, a Democrat who greeted Zelensky at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant, shared the president&#x2019;s straightforward message: &quot;Thank you. And we need more,&quot; the Associated Press reported. The Scranton facility, one of the few in the U.S. manufacturing 155 mm artillery shells, has ramped up production over the past year. The Pennsylvania factory announced in August that it was boosting production of 155 mm artillery shells from 24,000 rounds per month to 36,000. Ukraine has already received over three million of these shells from the U.S. The 155 mm shells produced at the Scranton plant are designed for howitzer systems, large towed guns with long barrels capable of firing at different angles. These howitzers can hit targets from 24 to 32 kilometers (15 to 20 miles) away, making them crucial for ground forces to destroy enemy positions from a safe distance. Zelensky said he conveyed his appreciation to all the workers at the plant. &quot;It is in places like this where you can truly feel that the democratic world can prevail,&quot; he wrote on X. &quot;Thanks to people like these &#x2014; in Ukraine, in America, and in all partner countries &#x2014; who work tirelessly to ensure that life is protected.&quot; Zelensky is set to address the U.N. General Assembly in New York on Sept. 24 and 25, before heading to Washington on Sept. 26 for meetings with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. His visit aims to bolster ongoing support for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-visits-pennsylvania-ammunition-plant-to-thank-workers/	2024-09-22T20:11:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2147867968.jpg
Zelensky calls JD Vance 'too radical,' says war should not end at Ukraine’s expense	In an interview with the New Yorker, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Donald Trump&apos;s running mate J. D. Vance is &quot;too radical&quot; in his ideas of how to end the war in Ukraine. &quot;The idea that the world should end this war at Ukraine&#x2019;s expense is unacceptable. But I do not consider this concept of his a plan, in any formal sense,&quot; Zelensky said during the interview published on Sept. 22. Vance said in an interview with Shawn Ryan on Sept. 12 that Donald Trump&apos;s plan to end Russia&apos;s war could include the establishment of a special demilitarized zone between Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine would retain its sovereignty, but at the same time it would have to give guarantees to Russia that it would not join NATO or any other allied institutions, Vance added. &quot;I don&#x2019;t take Vance&#x2019;s words seriously, because, if this were a plan, then America is headed for global conflict. It will involve Israel, Lebanon, Iran, Taiwan, China, as well as many African countries. That approach would broadcast to the world the following implicit rule: I came, I conquered, now this is mine,&quot; Zelensky added. Zelensky announced on Sept. 22 that he began his official visit to the U.S., where he will share his much-anticipated &quot;victory plan&quot; with foreign leaders. Vance, who was selected as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump&apos;s running mate in July, has been outspoken about his opposition to U.S. aid for Ukraine. He repeatedly has said that he &quot;doesn&apos;t care about Ukraine,&quot; including just days after the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Vance also repeatedly disparaged Ukraine and voiced his unwillingness to continue U.S. support in leaked text messages with far-right conspiracy theorist Charles Johnson, the Washington Post reported on Aug. 7. According to the texts, which Johnson shared with the Washington Post, Vance said in October 2023, &quot;Dude, I won&apos;t even take calls from Ukraine.&quot; The exchange came as congressional Republicans began blocking an aid package for Ukraine, an impasse that continued for several months.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-calls-jd-vance-too-radical-says-war-should-not-end-at-ukraines-expense/	2024-09-22T19:47:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2153568546.jpg
Russian attack on apartment building in Zaporizhzhia injures 9	Nine civilians were injured in Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia overnight on Sept. 23, including one child. The strike resulted in a partial destruction of an apartment building, according to Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Ivan Fedorov. Monitoring groups reported that a guided aerial bomb was used in an attack in Zaporizhzhia on the same night, claiming this was the first time a guided aerial bomb reached Zaporizhzhia. The Kyiv Independent can not immediately verify the claims.According to Fedorov&#x2019;s Telegram channel, the percussive blast and resulting debris damaged nearby buildings and a fire broke out. Fedorov also reported that emergency services have responded to the scene of the attack and the injured are receiving medical attention.Zaporizhzhia&#x2019;s Police Department has reported that there were six strikes on the city.Guided aerial bombs are precision-guided munitions that have a shorter range than missiles, but are far cheaper to produce. The weapons are launched from aircraft within Russian territory, outside the range of Ukrainian air defense.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-apartment-building-in-zaporizhzhia-injures-9/	2024-09-22T17:57:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2024-09-22-19_45_35.jpeg
Update: Zelensky confirms Ukraine used domestically produced weapons to strike Russian arms depots	President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a Sept. 21 video address, stressed that Ukraine is striking Russian arms depots &quot;thanks to our capabilities, our weapons.&quot; His announcement came after Ukraine&apos;s General Staff confirmed on the afternoon of Sept. 21 that the country&apos;s military and security service struck two Russian arms depots overnight. &quot;Another arsenal in Russia has been damaged, and it was a significant arsenal for the occupier. [...] The Security Service of Ukraine has also done a good job on another arsenal of Russian troops. These were depots of Russian tactical missiles and guided aerial bombs &#x2013; all the things that Russia uses to terrorize our cities, our positions,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff confirmed a strike on the Tikhoretsk weapons depot in Krasnodar Krai, which it called one of three largest ammunition depots in Russia and &quot;one of the key storage facilities in the Russian military&apos;s logistics system.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s military has also confirmed a strike on an ammunition depot in Tver Oblast that was earlier reported by Russian Telegram channels. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) hit the 23rd arsenal of the Russian Defense Ministry&apos;s Main Artillery Directorate near the village of Oktyabrsky in Tver Oblast, according to the General Staff. Zelensky insisted that Ukraine&#x2019;s partners could further increase Ukraine&#x2019;s security by supplying long-range weapons and granting permission for their use. &quot;If we were able to use all of our capabilities to defend our country, if we had enough missiles and permissions that our partners can grant us, the situation would have been much better for our security, the security of Ukraine and everyone the world over who does not want to exist amid the aggression like this Russian aggression,&quot; Zelensky added.	https://kyivindependent.com/update-zelensky-confirms-ukraine-used-domestically-produced-weapons-to-strike-russian-arms-depots/	2024-09-22T16:25:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170870951.jpg
OSINT project reports another failed Russian nuclear missile test	Open-source intelligence project MeNMyRC reported on Sept. 19 that a test launch of Russia&#x2019;s RS-28 Sarmat Super-Heavy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) resulted in failure at the launch site in Plesetsk, Russia based on analysis of satellite images. Plesetsk Cosmodrome is a Russian spaceport located in Mirny, Arkhangelsk Oblast, about 800 kilometers north of Moscow. MeNMyRC reported the test as a &quot;complete failure,&quot; determining that the missile &quot;detonated in the silo leaving a massive crater and destroying the test site.&quot; Sarmat, which was placed on combat duty in 2023, often referred to as Satan II, is one of Russia&#x2019;s key components to its nuclear arsenal. The silo-based missile with multiple warheads was announced to be in development by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018 as a successor to the Cold War-era R-36 ICMBs, known by their NATO codename Satan. Maintenance of Russia&#x2019;s ICBM arsenal had been outsourced to Ukraine in 2008, however, that cooperation ended in 2014 with Russia&#x2019;s annexation of Crimea. The development of Sarmat began in 2013 and has been plagued with errors and delays. This was Sarmat&#x2019;s fourth failure since being placed on combat duty with Sarmat&#x2019;s only successful launch occurring in April 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/osint-project-reports-another-failed-russian-nuclear-missile-test/	2024-09-22T15:35:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1230595884.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine awaits Mirage 2000 jets, in talks about Gripen, Eurofighter Typhoon	Key developments on Sept. 21-22: Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said Ukraine has an agreement to receive Dassault Mirage 2000 jets. He didn&apos;t provide a timeline. According to the minister, Ukraine is in talks to acquire Swedish-made Saab JAS 39 Gripen and the Eurofighter Typhoon fighters. &quot;Soon we&apos;ll have results to announce,&quot; Umerov said during an interview aired on national TV on Sept. 22. &quot;We worked last year on pilot training, on building all the necessary infrastructure, and this year we will focus on how to scale it up enough to have an advantage over the enemy in the air,&quot; the minister said. French President Emmanuel Macron announced on June 6 that an unspecified number of Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets would be transferred to Ukraine, but did not provide a timeline. &quot;Tomorrow we will launch a new cooperation and announce the transfer of Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets to Ukraine, made by French manufacturer Dassault, and train their Ukrainian pilots in France,&quot; he said during a live interview. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces confirmed on the afternoon of Sept. 21 that the Ukrainian military and security service struck two Russian arms depots overnight. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed earlier the same day that its forces shot down and intercepted 101 Ukrainian drones overnight, while explosions were reported at ammunition depots in Krasnodar Krai and Tver Oblast. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff confirmed a strike on the Tikhoretsk weapons depot in Krasnodar Krai, which it called one of the three largest ammunition depots in Russia and &quot;one of the key storage facilities in the Russian military&apos;s logistics system.&quot; &quot;According to available information, at the time of the attack, another echelon was on the territory of the arsenal, which delivered at least 2,000 tons of ammunition, including from North Korea,&quot; reads the General Staff&apos;s report. A Russian Podlet radar system that aided air defense of the arsenal was also destroyed in the attack, according to the Ukrainian military. Veniamin Kondratyev, the regional governor, reported early on Sept. 21. that a drone strike in the Tikhoretsk district of Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai had caused detonations of &quot;explosive objects&quot; at an unspecified facility. Russian air defense units intercepted two drones over the Tikhoretsk district, Kondratyev said. &quot;The falling debris of one of them caused a fire that spread to explosive objects. A detonation began.&quot; Local authorities have evacuated 1,200 residents from the area near the blast, Kondratyev said later the same day. No casualties have been reported. Hours after the attack, Andrii Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine&apos;s state-run Center for Countering Disinformation, wrote that a depot was &quot;demilitarized&quot; in Russia&apos;s Tikhoretsk district and published videos allegedly showing the aftermath of the strike. North Korea-made KN23 missiles, artillery shells, and ammunition for Smerch rocket launchers were stored in the Tikhoretsk depot, Kovalenko added. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff also confirmed a strike on an ammunition depot in Tver Oblast that was earlier reported by Russian Telegram channels. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) hit the 23rd arsenal of the Russian Defense Ministry&apos;s Main Artillery Directorate near the village of Oktyabrsky in Tver Oblast, according to the General Staff. The local government in Tver Oblast reported that an unspecified number of drones were shot down in the region but did not disclose any details on the consequences of the attack. The facility is located near a weapons depot in Toropets, one of Russia&apos;s largest arsenals, that was attacked by Ukrainian drones on Sept. 18. Iran did not include mobile launchers along with its delivery of ballistic missiles to Russia, Reuters reported on Sept. 21, citing three sources with knowledge of the matter. Russia and Iran have deepened their military and political cooperation since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Tehran has provided Moscow with thousands of Shahed kamikaze drones used in attacks against Ukraine. After months of contradictory reports, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed on Sept. 10 that Russia had received deliveries of Fath-360 close-range ballistic missiles from Iran. Iran denied it had delivered ballistic missiles to Russia, calling the reports &quot;psychological warfare.&quot; There has been no official confirmation that Russia has used the missiles against Ukraine to date. A European diplomat, a European intelligence official, and a U.S. official told Reuters that Iran did &quot;not supply launchers with the Fath-360 missiles, raising questions about when and if the weapons will be operational.&quot; The officials spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. The European intelligence official told Reuters they did not expect Iran to provide the launchers. Expert analysis suggests this may be because Russia may modify trucks to carry the missiles. One expert told Reuters that the launchers typically used by Iranian forces may not be robust enough to operate in winter conditions in Ukraine. Another theory is that Iran is withholding the launchers for the time being to allow for &quot;space for new talks with Western powers on easing tensions,&quot; Reuters said. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and other Iranian officials are expected to meet with European officials on the sidelines of the upcoming U.N. General Assembly in New York. Ukraine, the E.U., and the U.S. introduced more sanctions against Iran in the wake of the confirmation of the missile delivery to Russia. The confirmation of the deliveries marked a &quot;further escalation of Iran&apos;s military support to Russia&apos;s war of aggression against Ukraine,&quot; the U.K., France, and Germany said in a joint statement. The three countries said they have &quot;privately and publicly been clear that we would take new and significant measures against Iran if the transfers took place.&quot; Moscow is preparing to carry out strikes against Ukrainian nuclear facilities ahead of winter, Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Sept. 21, citing Kyiv&apos;s intelligence data. The possible targets include open distribution devices at nuclear power plants and transmission substations, &quot;which are essential for the safe functioning of the nuclear energy system,&quot; according to Sybiha. &quot;Damage to these facilities would create a high risk of a nuclear incident that will have global consequences,&quot; Sybiha said in a statement published on social media. Ukraine&apos;s special services informed Kyiv&apos;s partners and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) about the possible threat. &quot;Russia is the only country that seized a nuclear power plant in Europe, blackmailing the world,&quot; the minister added. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe&apos;s largest nuclear power station, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. Its position near the front line has led to heightened nuclear safety risks throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale war. The Ukrainian power grid has been heavily damaged during Russian aerial attacks, and it remains unclear how much of the infrastructure can be repaired before the temperatures drop. Energy deficits necessitated rolling blackouts during the summer and autumn, with some officials warning that Ukrainians may have electricity for 6-7 hours per day in the upcoming winter. The United States may send Ukraine medium-range missiles for F-16 fighter jets as part of its latest military aid package, Politico reported on Sept. 20, citing unnamed U.S. officials. The U.S. is expected to announce a $375 million military assistance package for Kyiv next week, Reuters reported earlier on Sept. 20. The package represents the largest tranche of U.S. military aid for Ukraine since May 2024. A medium-range glide bomb known as the Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) might be included in the new package, officials told Politico. The missile can cover a distance of over 110 kilometers (70 miles). The contents of the package have not been finalized and are subject to change, the officials said. Reuters earlier reported that the U.S. would likely send patrol boats, ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS), artillery shells, and spare parts as part of the latest round of military assistance. The JSOW has a shorter range than U.S.-made Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), long-range missiles that can travel up to 300 kilometers (190 miles). Ukraine has urged Washington to grant permission for Ukrainian troops to use ATACMS to strike military targets located deep inside Russian territory. While JSOW missiles won&apos;t accomplish that goal, the 70-mile range would allow F-16 pilots to keep their distance from the front lines and Russian air defense systems. Ukraine received its first U.S.-made fourth-generation jets in late July and has already deployed F-16s to intercept Russian mass aerial attacks. One aircraft crashed during such a mission, marking Ukraine&apos;s first F-16 loss. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 22 that the Kursk incursion had delivered some success, primarily diverting Russian troops from other parts of the front line. But, when pressed to say whether the operation was a success, the president told The New Yorker that it was &quot;too early to judge.&quot; &quot;It has slowed down the Russians and forced them to move some of their forces to Kursk on the order of 40,000 troops. Already, our fighters in the east say that they are being battered less frequently,&quot; Zelensky said in the interview. &quot;I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s a resounding success or will bring about the end of the war or the end of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin. What it has done is show our partners what we&apos;re capable of,&quot; the president added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-sept-21-22/	2024-09-22T14:36:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1239151017.jpg
Zelensky begins visit to US, will share 'victory plan' with allies	President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his Sept. 22 evening video address to the nation that he begins his official visit to the U.S., where he will share his much-anticipated &#x201C;victory plan&#x201D; with foreign leaders. &#x201C;Ukraine will present the &#x2018;victory plan&#x2019; to the United States. U.S. President (Joe Biden) will be the first to see it in its entirety,&#x201D; Zelensky said, while talking aboard a plane. &#x201C;Of course, I will present the &#x2018;victory plan&#x2019; to all the leaders of the partner countries, who, like President Biden, are world leaders who can become leaders of peace by helping us,&#x201D; he added. As part of Zelensky&apos;s &quot;victory plan,&quot; Ukraine would ask for NATO membership within the months, not years, according to the information obtained by the Kyiv Independent. Zelensky is expected to present the &quot;victory plan&quot; to Biden at the White House on Sept. 26. He also plans to discuss it with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris and members of Congress. Ukraine said it is open to suggestions from the U.S. to strengthen the plan. U.S. officials said they had been acquainted with elements of Zelensky&apos;s strategy and voiced belief &quot;that (it) can work.&quot; After that, Zelensky promises to make the &quot;victory plan&quot; public. Zelensky said that the plan was designed to end the war with the backing of international partners without relying on Russia&apos;s cooperation. However, he did not specify how it would achieve this. According to Zelensky, he will visit an unspecified location in Pennsylvania and then travel to New York City and Washington, D.C. &#x201C;It is this fall that will decide what will happen next in this war. Together with our partners, we can strengthen our positions as necessary for our victory, joint victory &#x2013; for a truly just peace,&#x201D; the president added. During his nearly week-long trip to the U.S., Zelensky will attend the U.N. General Assembly, speak with Biden at the White House, and meet with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Brazilian President Lula da Silva, according to media reports. Other meetings have not been announced at this time.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-begins-visit-to-us-will-share-victory-plan-with-allies/	2024-09-22T12:39:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170652956.jpg
Amid loss and uncertainty of wartime, Kyiv’s jazz fusion scene plays on – one filmmaker wants to capture it	At the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war, Kyiv-based Swiss filmmaker Marc Wilkins, like many artists in Ukraine, was struggling to create. &#x201C;The violence around me left me feeling paralyzed,&#x201D; Wilkins, who has lived full-time in Ukraine since 2016, told the Kyiv Independent. But then Wilkins learned of an admirable initiative in Kyiv&#x2019;s jazz fusion scene, which he had been following for some years leading up to the full-scale war. The musicians affiliated with the Fusion Jams collective &#x2013; which describes itself on social media as &#x201C;a community of contemporary jazz and free people&#x201D; &#x2013; were coming together to stage performances and collect funds for the Ukrainian military. &#x201C;Louder than Bombs,&#x201D; the documentary that Wilkins is making, will chronicle the lives of these young musicians, and how the war led to some of them composing music even on the front line.Wilkins is currently running a fundraiser to secure the 39,000 euros ($43,574) in financing needed to continue the film&#x2019;s production. Swiss filmmaker Marc Wilkins while winning the Swiss Filmaward in an undated photo. (Personal archive of Marc Wilkins)The young musicians in Kyiv&#x2019;s jazz fusion scene are driven by more than just patriotism as they raise funds for the military during their concerts. Their lives, like the majority of Ukrainians, have been forever changed by Russia&#x2019;s war. At the start of the full-scale invasion, Fusion Jams lost one of their own &#x2013; Oleksandra Kuvshynova. Kuvshynova&#x2019;s name made international headlines when she was killed in Kyiv Oblast while working as a fixer for the U.S. media outlet Fox News, but she was also a beloved member of Ukraine&#x2019;s jazz fusion community for her contributions to build up the Fusion Jams collective in the years leading up to the full-scale war. Organizing concerts to raise money for the military was a kind of &#x201C;artistic revenge&#x201D; for their fallen friend, according to Wilkins. Kyiv&#x2019;s jazz fusion scene is defined by the dynamic energy of its young musicians. Founded in 2019, Fusion Jams was established, in part, with a need to go against the stereotype that jazz was an antiquated music genre and to encourage young people to have a space to create. Jazz fusion, which first emerged as a genre in the 1960s, blends elements of jazz with rock, funk, hip-hop, and other musical styles. Known for its boundary-pushing approach, jazz fusion is distinguished from traditional jazz by more experimentation with both stylistic elements and technological innovations.

Undated photo. (Wikimedia)Fusion Jams became one of the largest music communities in Kyiv, even before the full-scale war.Kyiv&#x2019;s jazz fusion musicians &#x201C;look just like the cool kids that can be found searching for their paths into adulthood in New York, London or Berlin,&#x201D; if it weren&#x2019;t for the fact their lives, like those of all Ukrainians, have been forever changed by the war, according to Wilkins. The fact that they were still creating music during wartime &#x201C;touched me so deeply and gave me so much light and energy to see that we continue to exist (in Ukraine) through culture and art,&#x201D; Wilkins said. As a musical genre, jazz epitomizes individuality and creative freedom due to its strong emphasis on improvisation. Simultaneously, it fosters a sense of mutual understanding among musicians, as creating compelling music requires musicians to listen attentively and remain in harmony with one another.For Wilkins, who was inspired to move to Ukraine after &#x201C;seeing European history in the making&#x201D; during the Revolution of Dignity (EuroMaidan Revolution) in 2014, the country&#x2019;s jazz fusion scene serves as a powerful metaphor for its democratic transition. &#x201C;Something that we are kind of lacking sometimes here in Ukraine is the ability to listen to each other and give each other a little space &#x2014; a certain flexibility, let&#x2019;s say. When there&#x2019;s an external threat, Ukrainians are incredibly united and always come together. But outside of that, it can still be difficult for people,&#x201D; he said. This issue can be attributed to the lingering effects of centralized control from the Soviet era, which can still exert an influence over some people and how they view themselves and the world around them. &#x201C;Fusion jams are the opposite of that. You cannot come on stage without listening and giving space to the others. That&#x2019;s why I feel (this music is) incredibly important for Ukraine and Ukrainian society.&#x201D; Since settling in Kyiv, Wilkins has made important contributions to the city&#x2019;s cultural life. He co-founded the Naked Room, a gallery dedicated to showcasing the works of contemporary Ukrainian artists. They also established a digital marketplace where people can support Ukrainian artists by purchasing their art. Wilkins is also a co-founder of Reitarska Circle, a popular food market in Kyiv inside of a renovated Soviet-era modernist building. The project is a rare example of business owners cooperating with an original architect to preserve their vision and rethink public spaces in a respectful way. L: Andrii in an undated photo. (Personal archive of CNCTD) C: Jazz session in an undated photo. (Personal archive of Akim Karpach) R: Mykhailo Birchenko in an undated photo. (Personal archve of Olga Beznos)The anticipated final version of &#x201C;Louder than Bombs&#x201D; will highlight the various ways Russia&apos;s war has disrupted the lives of the Fusion Jams musicians, including how some were compelled to fight on the front line.These trajectories are particularly compelling not only because they reflect the choices of artists but also because they resonate with the broader experiences of every Ukrainian since the start of Russia&#x2019;s war.By day, Danylo, a composer turned commander, shoots down Russian tanks as a part of a drone unit, and at night, he creates music on the keyboard he brought with him to the front line to find some sort of temporary escape from the horrors of war he witnesses firsthand.Mykhailo, one of the founders of Fusion Jams, is still making music and raising funds for the military. But the male musicians who are continuing to create music in Kyiv understand that they might not always have that luxury and can be mobilized.Andriy, a saxophonist, tries to compose as many new songs as possible as a means of mentally reconciling with the prospect of being drafted into the military, where he faces the risk of death.Anna turns to the bandura, a traditional Ukrainian stringed instrument, after the death of her first love who was killed in battle. L: Anna, bandurist player in an undated photo. (Personal archive of Marc Wilkins) R: Anton Sominaryst, the drummer, in an undated photo. (Personal archive of Anton Sominaryst)Wilkins hopes that viewers of the documentary will see that &#x201C;Louder than Bombs&#x201D; is &#x201C;about rebel artists, dreamers, and the power of art to transcend reality at its bleakest, as much as it is about violence, identity and freedom.&#x201D;The documentary would be a celebration of Ukrainians&#x2019; humanity, creativity, and resilience over the past two and a half years. Wilkins believes Kyiv&#x2019;s jazz fusion community can show the world how Ukrainians, despite Russia&#x2019;s intent on destroying Ukraine, are able to overcome feelings of fear and despair &#x2013; in their case, through creating music. &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t know what will happen to us tonight, we don&#x2019;t know what will happen to us tomorrow,&#x201D; Wilkins said. &#x201C;But we really want to finish this film.&#x201D;If you would like to support the production of &#x201C;Louder than Bombs,&#x201D; consider contributing to Marc&#x2019;s fundraiser on Indiegogo. Hi, this is Kate Tsurkan, sharing an important culture-related story from Ukraine. It&apos;s important to show the ways in which Ukraine&apos;s cultural sphere is enduring despite the hardships of wartime and that&apos;s why I was so inspired to write about this documentary. Hopefully, we can see more and more dynamic films like this in the future.

Too early to judge' – Zelensky on success of Kursk incursion	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 22 that the Kursk incursion had delivered some success, primarily diverting Russian troops from other parts of the front line. But, when pressed to say whether the operation was a success, the president told The New Yorker that it was &quot;too early to judge.&quot; &quot;It has slowed down the Russians and forced them to move some of their forces to Kursk on the order of 40,000 troops. Already, our fighters in the east say that they are being battered less frequently,&quot; Zelensky said in the interview. &quot;I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s a resounding success or will bring about the end of the war or the end of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin. What it has done is show our partners what we&apos;re capable of,&quot; the president added. Zelensky also added that Ukrainian troops are continuing to provide Russian civilians trapped in the area food, water, and other commodities. &quot;These people are free to leave: all the necessary corridors are open, and they could go elsewhere in Russia&#x2014;but they do not,&quot; the president said. Ukrainian officials previously shared different accounts of the situation. Oleksiy Dmytrashkivskyi, a spokesman for Ukraine&apos;s military administration in Kursk Oblast, said Russian civilians from occupied areas could leave for Russian-controlled territory only after Ukraine and Russia &quot;agree, through international organizations that deal with these issues, to open a green corridor under the supervision of observers.&quot; Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, seizing around 100 settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles). Russia&apos;s counterattack in Kursk Oblast aiming to retake Ukrainian-held territory has been stopped, Dmytrashkivskyi told AFP on Sept. 18. The statement comes a week after Moscow launched a counteroffensive against the western flank of Ukrainian troops in the Russian region. &quot;They tried to attack from the flanks, but they were stopped there,&quot; Dmytrashkivskyi said.	https://kyivindependent.com/too-early-to-judge-zelensky-on-success-of-kursk-incursion/	2024-09-22T12:05:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168599470.jpg
Zelensky says it would be horrible if Biden didn't support Ukraine's victory plan, which includes NATO membership	As part of President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s &quot;victory plan,&quot; Ukraine would ask for NATO membership within the months, not years, according to the information obtained by the Kyiv Independent. A similar estimate was shared by The New Yorker in an interview with Zelensky, published on Sept. 22. When asked what would happen if U.S. President Joe Biden rejected Ukraine&apos;s &quot;victory plan,&quot; Zelensky told The New Yorker, &quot;That&apos;s a horrible thought.&quot; &quot;It would mean that Biden doesn&apos;t want to end the war in any way that denies Russia a victory,&quot; the president added. &quot;And we would end up with a very long war&#x2014;an impossible, exhausting situation that would kill a tremendous number of people. Having said that, I can&apos;t blame Biden for anything,&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky is expected to present the &quot;victory plan&quot; to Biden at the White House on Sept. 26.

Ukraine awaits Mirage 2000 jets, in talks about Gripen, Eurofighter Typhoon	Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said Ukraine has an agreement to receive Dassault Mirage 2000 jets. He didn&apos;t provide a timeline. According to the minister, Ukraine is in talks to acquire Swedish-made Saab JAS 39 Gripen and the Eurofighter Typhoon fighters. &quot;Soon we&apos;ll have results to announce,&quot; Umerov said during an interview aired on national TV on Sept. 22. &quot;We worked last year on pilot training, on building all the necessary infrastructure, and this year we will focus on how to scale it up enough to have an advantage over the enemy in the air,&quot; the minister said. &quot;These processes are already established but need to be scaled,&quot; he added. French President Emmanuel Macron announced on June 6 that an unspecified number of Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets would be transferred to Ukraine, but did not provide a timeline. Speaking to French TV after the end of the 80th anniversary of D-Day commemorations in Normandy, Macron also said his country would train Ukrainian pilots. &quot;Tomorrow we will launch a new cooperation and announce the transfer of Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets to Ukraine, made by French manufacturer Dassault, and train their Ukrainian pilots in France,&quot; he said during a live interview. The first cohort of Ukrainian pilots have completed Alpha Jet training in France, the French Armed Forces announced on Sept. 20. Meanwhile, Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom told Voice of America in an interview published on July 10 that Stockholm is open to providing Ukraine with Gripen fighter jets after the &quot;F-16 program is completed.&quot; Ukraine received its first F-16s in August. Just 10 jets have been delivered so far, according to media reports. Kyiv has been promised at least 79 F-16s from the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, and Belgium.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-awaits-mirage-2000-jets-in-talks-about-gripen-eurofighter-typhoon/	2024-09-22T09:13:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170737007.jpg
Zelensky to push Biden to bolster Ukraine’s firepower as allies await US leadership	President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to be the latest world leader to nudge his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden in a face-to-face meeting into providing more firepower to Kyiv &#x2014; key to a potential Ukrainian victory &#x2014; and the crucial right to use it against Russia&#x2019;s invading forces without restrictions. The pitch, packaged as part of Zelensky&#x2019;s &#x201C;victory plan,&#x201D; will be made during the Ukrainian leader&#x2019;s visit this week to the U.S. for the UN General Assembly and his meeting with Biden. Zelensky also hopes to share his proposal with the two contenders for the November presidential elections: Vice President Kamala Harris from the Democratic party and Republican candidate Donald Trump. The visit comes at a pivotal moment in Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion launched in early 2022, with both sides scrambling for resources. Zelensky&#x2019;s in-person plea, which will be made later this week to his most powerful ally and leader of the free world comes as a group of European countries has been pressuring Washington, specifically outgoing President Biden, to boost weaponry for Kyiv and greenlight its strikes deeper into Russia using Western missiles. &#x201C;Our clear strategy will be on the table for our partners, for the President of the United States,&#x201D; Zelensky said in his Sept. 21 evening address to the nation on the eve of his visit. He is expected to arrive on Sept. 22 and will reportedly kick off the trip with a visit to a Scranton, Pennsylvania factory producing artillery for his armed forces. &#x201C;The next week can be decisive in many ways for stopping the Russian terror, this aggression, and restoring normal security. For this to happen, the determination of our partners must match the courage of Ukrainians,&#x201D; Zelensky said. Zelensky also praised Ukraine&#x2019;s forces for conducting a long-range drone strike on Sept. 21 that severely damaged yet another Russian weapons depot in the past days, adding: &#x201C;I want to emphasize that we are doing this thanks to our capabilities, our weapons &#x2013; without the means that can be provided by our partners and that can significantly accelerate the end of this war by destroying Russia&apos;s offensive potential.&#x201D; &#x201C;The answer to the question of when this war will end lies in the question of when our partners&apos; determination will keep pace with what we can do for our defense, for our independence, for our victory,&#x201D; he added Some European officials have shown frustration over Washington&#x2019;s apparent unwillingness to take the lead in strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s hand on the battlefield. While it was the U.S. three years ago warning its allies of the war&#x2019;s imminent threat and urging them to back Ukraine, now it is the U.K. and some small European nations neighboring Russia, such as the Baltic states, that have been Kyiv&#x2019;s strongest allies &#x2013; nudging Washington in offering Ukraine a wild card. The hope is to boost chances of a Ukrainian victory, with an upper hand in future peace negotiations instead of bleeding out in a drawn-out war in which it is outgunned and outmanned as Russian forces are increasingly being armed with ballistic missiles from North Korea and Iran. Poland&#x2019;s foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski told Bloomberg on Sept. 21 that Ukraine&#x2019;s success hangs on &#x201C;whether the Biden administration will be braver&#x201D; during this autumn&#x2019;s presidential election by boosting support for Ukraine before he leaves office. Zelensky&#x2019;s visit comes days after UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited Biden urging permission for Ukraine to conduct strikes deep into Russia using Western missiles, including the British-supplied Storm Shadows, which have U.S. components. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken (L) and Britain&apos;s Foreign Secretary David Lammy (R) pose with Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky (C) at the Mariinsky Palace in Kyiv, on Sept. 11, 2024. U.S. and British top diplomats came to Ukraine to discuss further easing rules on firing Western weapons into Russia. (Photo by Mark Schiefelbein/AFP via Getty Images)Late last week, Biden said he looks forward to reassuring &#x201C;America&#x2019;s commitment to supporting Ukraine as it defends its freedom and independence.&#x201D; But in repeating such general assurances that Biden has delivered many times while drip-feeding weaponry to Ukraine, he sparked only further criticism. John Sipher, a former clandestine senior CIA officer who served in Moscow, hammered Biden in a reply to his post on X. &#x201C;You risk a strategic failure,&#x201D; Sipher wrote. &#x201C;Create a policy of Ukrainian victory and Putin&#x2019;s defeat. We are not acting like a superpower,&#x201D; Sipher added. The warning to the U.S. president came after earlier hopes he would use his lame-duck days to boost support for Ukraine&apos;s chances of victory and avoid another tarnish on his presidency on top of the disastrous pullout from Afghanistan. &quot;Whatever we see of Joe Biden during those two &#x2018;lame duck&#x2019; months is whoever the real Joe Biden is,&#x201D; said Doug Klain, a policy analyst at Razom for Ukraine, a pro-Ukrainian lobbying group based in Washington, D.C., and a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council&#x2019;s Eurasia Center. Will he be &#x201C;truly unburdened by political calculus and with a sole focus on legacy, and what does he want to leave behind?&#x201D; Klain asked. &#x201C;If he wants to leave behind a Ukraine that is set up for victory, then I think that is the time to really go all in,&quot; he added. The Ukrainian president, speaking at a press conference during European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen&apos;s visit to Kyiv on Sept. 20, said he hoped for a quick decision from all Western allies to support his &#x201C;victory plan.&#x201D; He stressed the importance of the U.S. leadership role, which diplomats have told the Kyiv Independent recently has not been felt strongly.

Washington Convention Center in Washington, DC, on July 11, 2024. (Photo by Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images)&quot;Most of the decisions from the plan depend specifically on him (Biden). On other allies too, but there are certain points which depend on the goodwill and support of the United States,&quot; Zelensky said. &#x201C;The entire plan is predicated upon quick decisions from our partners. The plan is predicated upon decisions which should take place from October to December, and not delaying these processes,&quot; Zelensky added. Biden is &#x201C;not ruling out&#x201D; lifting restrictions on Ukraine&#x2019;s use of long-range weapons to strike Russian territory, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Sky News in a September interview. Ukrainian officials have long pleaded for the right to conduct deep strikes into Russia using Western missiles already provided and those they are hoping the U.S. will supply soon. The Biden administration has weighed the decision for more than three months after allowing Ukraine to counterfire in neighboring Russian territory using some of its smaller caliber weaponry, such as multiple-launch rocket systems. Ukraine&#x2019;s hope in gaining permission to also fire Western missiles deep into Russia is that it could, like a slingshot tactic in this David vs. Goliath war, grind down Russia&#x2019;s combat capabilities from afar &#x2014; and affect its ability to conduct attacks on Ukraine. Ukrainian drone strikes are already targeting Russian airfields, ammunition depots, and oil refineries, but Western long-range weapons &#x2013; such as British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles or U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles &#x2013; would be a game changer allowing Ukraine to strike more targets more effectively. Ukraine is also hoping the Biden administration will soon approve the supply of the larger stocked JASSM cruise missiles.

(South Korean Defense Ministry via Getty Images)&#xA0;Ukraine&#x2019;s call to lift the restrictions on long-range strikes comes as some independent analysts say Moscow&#x2019;s troops could be slowly exhausting their enormous Soviet-era stocks in the upcoming year. This offers hope that Ukraine could, with double-downed Western armaments, gain a window of opportunity to hit Russia hard. Ukraine said that it had already shown the U.S. a list of targets that its armed forces seek to strike with ATACMS missiles deep inside Russia, trying to show the decision&#x2019;s potential impact. The U.K. has already privately approved the Ukrainian use of Storm Shadow missiles for long-range strikes, the Guardian reported on Sept. 11, citing anonymous U.K. officials. However, London is reportedly waiting for Washington&#x2019;s approval rather than unilaterally committing to it. Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that allowing Ukraine to conduct long-range strikes using Western weapons would &#x201C;mean that NATO countries &#x2013; the U.S. and European countries &#x2013; are at war with Russia.&#x201D; Officials in Ukraine and some leaders of some Western allies have described Russia&#x2019;s warnings and &#x201C;red lines&#x201D; as empty scare tactics to intimidate and deter Ukraine&#x2019;s backers from approving such strikes and providing the weaponry. &#x201C;We probably realize now that we have to cross all of these &#x2018;red lines&#x2019; and then start forcing Russia out of Ukraine,&#x201D; Estonian President Alar Karis told the Kyiv Independent in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of the 20th annual Yalta European Strategy (YES) Conference in Kyiv. &#x201C;We should lift the restrictions on the use of weapons that Ukraine gets,&#x201D; he said, adding: &#x201C;We want to defeat Russia, that&apos;s for sure &#x2026; As far as defense (goes), the U.S. should be number one (leading) in this case.&#x201D; Ukraine understands that Western allies must reach &#x201C;a major decision&#x201D; together and that &#x201C;there needs to be a collective will and support&#x201D; for it, but time is costly as every day means &#x201C;lost lives,&#x201D; said Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi. &#x201C;We cannot sit and wait for decisions for weeks and months because here, lives depend on some of the decisions (made by Western allies),&#x201D; Tykhyi said at a briefing in Kyiv.

Iran provided no launchers with missile deliveries to Russia, Reuters reports	Iran did not include mobile launchers along with its delivery of ballistic missiles, Reuters reported on Sept. 21, citing three sources with knowledge of the matter. Russia and Iran have deepened their military and political cooperation since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Tehran has provided Moscow with thousands of Shahed kamikaze drones used in attacks against Ukraine. After months of contradictory reports, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed on Sept. 10 Russia had received deliveries of Fath-360 close-range ballistic missiles from Iran. Iran denied it had delivered ballistic missiles to Russia, calling reports to the contrary &quot;psychological warfare.&quot; There has been no official confirmation that Russia has used the missiles against Ukraine to date. A European diplomat, a European intelligence official, and a U.S. official told Reuters that Iran did &quot;not supply launchers with the Fath-360 missiles, raising questions about when and if the weapons will be operational.&quot; The officials spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. The European intelligence official told Reuters they did not expect Iran to provide the launchers. Expert analysis suggests this may be because Russia may modify trucks to carry the missiles. One expert told Reuters that the launchers typically used by Iranian forces may not be robust enough to operate in winter conditions in Ukraine. Another theory is that Iran is withholding the launchers for the time being to allow for &quot;space for new talks with Western powers on easing tensions,&quot; Reuters said. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and other Iranian officials are expected to meet with European officials on the sidelines of the upcoming U.N. General Assembly in New York. Ukraine, the E.U., and the U.S. introduced more sanctions against Iran in the wake of the confirmation of the missile delivery to Russia. &#xA0; The confirmation of the deliveries marked a &quot;further escalation of Iran&apos;s military support to Russia&apos;s war of aggression against Ukraine,&quot; the U.K., France, and Germany said in a joint statement. The three countries said they have &quot;privately and publicly been clear that we would take new and significant measures against Iran if the transfers took place.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/iran-provided-no-launchers-with-its-missile-deliveries-to-russia-reuters-reports/	2024-09-22T06:01:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1230595884.jpg
Zelensky's 'victory plan' and Biden's long-range strike dilemma | Ukraine This Week	The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Anna Belokur explains the top stories of the week, from Zelensky&#x2019;s &quot;victory plan&quot; to Biden&#x2019;s policy on long-range missile strikes within Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelenskys-victory-plan-and-bidens-long-range-strike-dilemma-ukraine-this-week/	2024-09-22T05:22:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/IMG_6374.jpg
Russian attack on mine in Donetsk Oblast kills 2 women, injures 1	Russian troops shelled a mine in Donetsk Oblast, killing two female mine employees and injuring one other person, Ukraine&apos;s Energy Ministry reported on Sept. 22. According to the Energy Ministry, the shelling caused a fire to break out in the area above the mine, leading to the evacuation of 371 miners who were below the ground at the time of the attack. After the attack, two female workers were found dead when the territory of the mine was inspected. Another person was taken to hospital. The Energy Ministry did not specify where or when the attack took place, but Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin reported early on Sept. 22 that two people had been killed and one person had been injured in Udachne the previous day. Udachne, a village 12 kilometers (7 miles) west of Pokrovsk, is the site of one of the largest coal mines in Ukraine. &#xA0; Russian attacks against Ukraine&apos;s coal-rich Donbas region regularly put the lives of miners in danger. An attack in July set fire to a mine in Donetsk Oblast with 86 miners inside. The Energy Ministry did not report any casualties after the fire was extinguished. Earlier in September, 151 miners were trapped underground at a mine in Dobropillia, a town 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Pokrovsk, when a Russian attack caused a blackout.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-mine-in-donetsk-oblast-kills-2-injures-1/	2024-09-22T04:12:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2147962555.jpg
Russia launches over 1,000 aerial weapons against Ukraine in a week, Zelensky says	Russia has launched nearly 30 missiles, around 400 drones, and more than 900 guided aerial bombs at Ukraine over the past week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 22, as he called for Ukraine to be given long-range strike capabilities. On Sept. 21 alone, 21 people were injured in Kharkiv when Russia targeted an apartment building with a FAB-250 guided aerial bomb. The day before, a Russian missile strike on Kryvyi Rih killed a 12-year-old boy and two women aged 75 and 79. Over the past week, at least 31 civilians have been killed and over 200 injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine. &quot;We need to strengthen our capabilities to better protect lives and ensure safety,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Ukraine needs full long-range capabilities, and we are working to convince our partners of this. We will continue these discussions next week.&quot; Ukraine has been restricted from using weapons supplied by its Western partners to strike deep inside Russia due to fears of escalation. Ukraine argues that striking military targets, such as airfields, would save the lives of civilians, as it would destroy the Russian aircraft that launch bombs and missiles against Ukrainian cities. While the U.S. eased restrictions on the use of certain arms just across the border after a Russian offensive in Kharkiv Oblast in May, limits on long-range strikes deep inside Russia remain in place. Reports emerged earlier in September that the U.S. and U.K. were preparing plans to further ease the restrictions, but no change in policy has so far been announced.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-400-drones-over-900-guided-aerial-bombs-at-ukraine-this-week/	2024-09-22T02:56:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/kharkiv_oblast_21.jpg
NATO jets intercept six Russian aircraft flying over Baltic Sea	NATO jets intercepted six Russian aircraft flying over the Baltic Sea without transponders or a flight plan over the past two days, the Latvian Air Force reported late on Sept. 21. Transponders are an electronic device that helps maintain safe air traffic in international airspace. Russian jets regularly enter the airspace above the Baltics with transponders switched off, likely to test the response of NATO states. The Russian jets were identified over the Baltic Sea on Sept. 20 and Sept. 21 and escorted by NATO Eurofighter jets as part of NATO&apos;s Baltic Air Policing mission, the Latvian Air Force said. According to the German Air Force, a group of five jets were identified on the afternoon of Sept. 21, consisting of one Sukhoi Su-35 and four Sukhoi Su-30MKIs. In August, the German Air Force reported that Russian pilots who were detected heading toward Latvian airspace &quot;behaved uncooperatively but not aggressively&quot; when intercepted by NATO&apos;s Baltic Air Policing mission. &quot;The transponders were switched off, and the pilots did not respond to radio requests,&quot; &#xA0;a German Air Force spokesperson said. Earlier in September, a Russian Shahed-type drone equipped with an explosive crashed in Latvia, the first confirmed case of a Russian drone crashing on Latvian soil. Lieutenant General Leonids Kalnins, the commander-in-chief of the Latvian Armed Forces, said on Sept. 9 that the drone was heading towards a target in Ukraine before it entered Latvia via Belarus. The drone eventually crashed in Gaigalava parish in Rezekne district, 85 kilometers (52 miles) northwest of the Belarusian border, Kalnins said.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-intercept-six-russian-aircraft-over-baltic-sea/	2024-09-22T02:03:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GYAfmakWoAEGfks.jpeg
Russian attacks kill 5, injure 40 in Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed 5 people, and wounded another 40 over the past day, regional authorities reported early on Sept. 22. Civilian casualties were reported in Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson, and Donetsk oblasts. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported that 71 of the 80 attack drones launched by Russia were downed overnight. Russia also launched two Kh-59/69 missiles from the airspace of occupied Luhansk Oblast. Russia dropped a FAB-250 aerial bomb on the city of Kharkiv late on Sept. 21, damaging multiple high-rise apartment buildings and injuring 21 people. Among the wounded, a 17-year-old boy and a 39-year-old woman were hospitalized in serious condition, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. According to Syniehubov, the attack impacted nine buildings, broke more than 1,200 windows, and damaged 21 cars. The city of Nikopol in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast came under attack repeatedly during the evening and the night, targeted by Russian multiple rocket launchers, artillery fire, and kamikaze drones, Governor Sehii Lysak said. A 25-year-old woman and a 12-year-old girl were killed in Nikopol when a Russian drone hit their car. The attack injured a 25-year-old man and a 4-year-old girl who were also in the vehicle. The 4-year-old girl&apos;s condition is still serious, and she has small shrapnel injuries to her head, upper limbs, and forearms, Lysak reported on the morning of Sept. 21. Five people had been injured in Kherson Oblast over the past day as a result of Russian attacks, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Among the victims was a 72-year-old woman, who was injured when Russian forces attacked the village of Stanislav with a drone. A man in the city of Kherson was also injured in a drone attack, sustaining injuries to his head, back, arms, and legs. Two people in the city of Beryslav were injured in a drone attack, while a 52-year-old man in Antonivka, a village close to Kherson, was injured by artillery shrapnel. Three people were killed and 12 others were injured as a result of Russian attacks in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Two people were killed and one person was injured in Udachne, a settlement 12 kilometers (7 miles) west of Pokrovsk. One person was killed and two others injured in Kurakhove, a town located around 30. kilometers (18 miles) south of Pokrovsk, and just a few kilometers from the front line. Other regions of Ukraine, including Sumy, Mykolaiv, Khmelnytskyi, and Kyiv oblasts, also came under Russian drone and missile attacks over the past day, but no civilian casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-sept-22/	2024-09-22T00:48:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172855484.jpg

US, India, Japan, Australia issue joint statement calling for peace in Ukraine	The leaders of the United States, India, Japan, and Australia called for &quot;a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace&quot; in Ukraine in a joint statement following the Quad Leaders Summit on Sept. 21. The Quad countries &#x2014;&#xA0;the U.S., India, Japan, and Australia &#x2014;&#xA0;form a strategic alliance dedicated to shared economic and security interests in the Indo-Pacific region. The Sept. 21 meeting marks the group&apos;s fourth annual leaders&apos; summit. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio, and U.S. President Joe Biden convened in Wilmington, Delaware to discuss their ongoing cooperation. Their joint declaration included a call for peace in Ukraine. &quot;(W)e reiterate the need for a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in line with international law, consistent with the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, including respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity,&quot; the statement read. &quot;We also note the negative impacts of the war in Ukraine with regard to global food and energy security.&quot; The declaration also said the use or threat of nuclear weapons was &quot;unacceptable&quot; in the context of the war. The statement did not explicitly condemn the Russian Federation for its full-scale invasion, instead reiterating that &quot;all states must refrain from the threat of or use of force against the territorial integrity and sovereignty or political independence of any state.&quot; The Quad declaration comes as world leaders gather in the U.S. ahead of the 79th U.N. General Assembly in New York City. President Volodymyr Zelensky will present his victory plan for Ukraine to Biden on the sidelines of the General Assembly. He will also reportedly meet with Japan&apos;s Kishio during his visit to the U.S. India&apos;s Modi visited Kyiv on Aug. 23, marking the first time an Indian prime minister has set foot in Ukraine since diplomatic relations were established over 30 years ago. Modi&apos;s visit came just weeks after Modi&apos;s trip to Moscow, where he held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. India has maintained close economic and diplomatic ties with Moscow since February 2022, with bilateral trade reaching a historic high in 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-india-japan-australia-issue-joint-statement-calling-for-peace-in-ukraine/	2024-09-21T20:57:26-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172813579.jpg
Iran unveils new ballistic missile, upgraded Shahed drone	The Iranian Armed Forces showcased domestically-produced weapons, including a modernized Shahed-136B drone and new ballistic missile, at a military parade in Tehran on Sept. 21, according to Iran&apos;s state news agency. Iran is a key weapons supplier to the Russian military and has provided Moscow with thousands of Shahed kamikaze drones since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Tehran unveiled the new drone and missile along with other homegrown missiles during a Sept. 21 parade, kicking off a week of demonstrations honoring the Iranian military. The Shahed-136B is reportedly an upgraded version of the Shahed-136, a type of drone used by Russia in near-daily attacks against Ukraine. The new version has a range of 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles), according to Iran. Iran&apos;s &quot;Jihad&quot; ballistic missile is a solid-fuel missile with an operational range of 1,000 kilometers (over 600 miles). The new weapon was unveiled at the parade, where it was one of 21 ballistic missiles on display. The U.S. on Sept. 10 confirmed that Iran had shipped Fath-360 ballistic missiles to Russia. &#xA0;The Fath-360 is a close-range ballistic missile with a 150-kilogram warhead. Ukraine and some Western countries imposed new sanctions against Iran following reports of the missile transfer. Moscow and Tehran have deepened their military and political cooperation since February 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/iran-unveils-new-ballistic-missile-upgraded-shahed-drone/	2024-09-21T20:12:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172668747.jpg
Zelensky to visit US ammunition factory producing shells for Ukraine	President Volodymyr Zelensky will visit the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant, a factory producing critically-need 155 mm shells for Ukraine, during his visit to the United States on Sept. 22. Zelensky will visit the U.S. in the coming week to present the details of his victory plan to U.S. President Joe Biden and other leaders on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. The visit will start with a tour of the Scranton ammunition plant, located in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, officials familiar with Zelensky&apos;s schedule told the Associated Press (AP) on Sept. 21. Zelensky will thank factory workers for producing artillery shells desperately needed on Ukraine&apos;s front lines. The Pennsylvania factory announced in August that it was boosting production of 155 mm artillery shells from 24,000 rounds per month to 36,000. The plant, which employs about 300 people, highlights the local economic benefits of U.S. support for Ukraine. The factory is also located in President Biden&apos;s birthplace, and could prove to be a pivotal talking point amid the heated campaign for the battleground state of Pennsylvania in the upcoming presidential election. The Scranton facility is one of the few plants in the U.S. that produces 155 mm shells. The U.S. military in May 2024 opened a new factory in Texas that will reportedly be able to produce 30,000 shells each month once it reaches its full capacity. The U.S. has sent Ukraine more than 3 million 155 mm shells since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, according to government records. Ukraine&apos;s European allies have scrambled to up their production of the 155 mm shells but fell far short of its promise to deliver 1 million artillery shells to Ukraine between March 2023 and 2024. After supplying only about half of the promised rounds, Brussels shifted the deadline to the end of 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-visit-us-ammunition-factory-producing-shells-for-ukraine/	2024-09-21T17:03:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2147867968.jpg
Putin must not win in Ukraine, Russian dissident Kara-Murza says	Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;must not be allowed&quot; to win the full-scale war against Ukraine, Russian opposition figure and journalist Vladimir Kara-Murza said during a press conference at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London on Sept. 20. Kara-Murza was released from a Russian penal colony on Aug. 1 as part of a historic prisoner exchange between the West and Russia. He had been sentenced to 25 years in prison in April 2023 for condemning Russia&apos;s all-out war in Ukraine. &quot;Vladimir Putin must not be allowed to win this war in Ukraine,&quot; Kara-Murza said at the press conference, organized jointly by RUSI and the Global Magnitsky Justice Campaign. &quot;More than that, he must not be allowed to have a face-saving exit from this war.&quot; Kara-Murza reportedly also met with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Sept. 20 to urge Western governments to provide stronger support for Ukraine&apos;s defense. &#xA0; During the RUSI press conference, Kara-Murza went on to say that Western nations should prepare for the Russian Federation to transition to a democratic government after Putin eventually leaves office. &quot;None of us knows exactly when, exactly in what circumstances, but it&apos;s going to happen in the very foreseeable future. And next time, we must get this right.&quot; Putin holds a high approval rating among the Russian population (over 80%, according to independent polls), though those numbers have fallen some as the full-scale war drags on. Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Kursk Oblast has also reportedly increased social discontent in Russia. A September 2024 poll found that nearly half of Russians may support the withdrawal of troops from Ukraine, even if the Kremlin&apos;s military goals are not achieved. Kara-Murza also advocated for the release of more Russian political prisoners. &quot;I wake up every morning and I go to sleep every night thinking about all the others who are still left behind,&quot; he said. A dual Russian-British citizen, Kara-Murza was charged with &quot;treason&quot; and &quot;spreading false information,&quot; among other crimes, after being arrested in April 2022. While imprisoned, Kara-Murza won the Pulitzer Prize in May 2024 for the commentary he wrote from his prison cell. Kara-Murza was released in a historic swap along with fellow Russian dissident Ilya Yashin, Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, and Russian-American journalist Alsa Kurmashova.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-must-not-win-in-ukraine-russian-dissident-kara-murza-says/	2024-09-21T16:07:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172311941.jpg
Russian strike on apartment building in Kharkiv injures at least 12	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russian forces targeted a multi-story apartment building in Kharkiv, Ukraine&apos;s second-largest city, on Sept. 21, wounding at least 12 people, according to Mayor Ihor Terekhov. The injured include one 8-year-old child and two teenagers aged 17, local authorities said. Sixty people have been evacuated from the high-rise. Terekhov reported via his official Telegram channel that the attack involved a guided bomb and that rescue efforts were ongoing at the scene. Kharkiv Governor Oleh Syniehubov confirmed two separate strikes had hit the city. At least four cars caught fire following the strike and 20 more were damaged. Kharkiv has been under constant Russian assault for more than two years since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-strike-on-apartment-building-in-kharkiv-injures-at-least-12/	2024-09-21T14:18:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2114357693-1.jpg
Russia says it will not take part in follow-up peace summit	Russia has announced it will not participate in any future iterations of the Swiss-hosted peace summit held in June, labeling the process a &quot;fraud,&quot; Russia&apos;s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Sept. 21. Moscow was not invited to the June summit attended by over 90 countries, dismissed the discussions as irrelevant without its involvement. President Volodymyr Zelensky, however, has expressed hope for a follow-up meeting by the end of the year, with the goal of including Russia. Zakharova criticized the summit on Telegram, saying: &quot;This process itself has nothing to do with a settlement. It is another manifestation of fraud by the Anglo-Saxons and their Ukrainian puppets.&quot; She emphasized that Russia is open to considering &quot;truly serious proposals&quot; that acknowledge the &quot;situation on the ground,&quot; a vague reference to Russia&#x2019;s annexation of four Ukrainian regions, none of which it fully controls. Zakharova accused Ukraine and its Western allies of having no interest in pursuing peace, referencing Ukraine&apos;s recent incursion into Russia&apos;s southern Kursk region and Zelensky&apos;s continued requests for long-range Western weapons. She said that Ukraine and its Western backers &quot;were not thinking about peace.&quot; Ahead of the June summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin had outlined conditions for negotiations, which included Kyiv&apos;s surrender of the four oblasts that Moscow now claims. Russia has since said it won&apos;t engage in talks as long as Ukrainian forces remain in the Kursk region. Zelensky has a plan on how to end Russia&#x2019;s war with Ukraine&#x2019;s victory. Kyiv remains tight-lipped about the specifics of the plan as Zelensky readies to present it to U.S. President Joe Biden and American presidential candidates during his upcoming visit. The plan is expected to cover military, political, diplomatic, and economic strategies.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-says-it-will-not-take-part-in-follow-up-peace-summit/	2024-09-21T12:40:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166613503-1.jpg
Russian attack on Nikopol kills 2, injures 2	Russian drone attack on the city of Nikopol killed two civilians, including a 12-year-old girl, and injured two others, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Governor Serhii Lysak reported. The drone reportedly hit a car, according to the governor. Two injured passengers included a four-year-old girl and a 25-year-old man. They have been transferred to the local hospital. The governor did not provide any further details. The city of Nikopol is the fourth-most populous city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, home to over 115,000 people. Dnipropetrovsk Oblast has been a frequent target of Russian attacks since the outbreak of the full-scale war. On Sept. 21., a Russian missile strike on Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast killed three people and injured three others, local authorities reported the morning. &#xA0;The attack destroyed two homes and damaged over two dozen others. It also damaged a school, garages, and cars. Kryvyi Rih, with a population of around 660,000, is the second most populous city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-nikopol-kills-2-injures-2-2/	2024-09-21T11:58:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2024-09-21-13_22_52.jpeg
Zelensky's 'victory plan' includes invitation to NATO, commitment to sustained weapons supply, Bloomberg reports	President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s &quot;victory plan&quot; includes an official invitation to join NATO and commitment to a sustained supply of advanced weapons, Bloomberg reported on Sept. 21, citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter. Kyiv remain secretive about the contents of the plan, which Zelensky plans to discuss with U.S. President Joe Biden during his visit to the U.S. next week. According to Zelensky, the &quot;victory plan&quot; consists of five points and focuses on Ukraine&apos;s security and geopolitical position, foreign military assistance with the freedom to use it without restrictions, and economic support. Apart from the NATO invitation and the arms supplies pledge, Bloomberg sources said that the &quot;victory plan&quot; includes a clear pathway to European Union membership. Zelensky is expected to present the &quot;victory plan&quot; to Biden at the White House on Sept. 26. He also plans to discuss it with presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris and members of Congress. Ukraine said it is open to suggestions from the U.S. to strengthen the plan. U.S. officials said they had been acquainted with elements of Zelensky&apos;s strategy and voiced belief &quot;that (it) can work.&quot; After that, Zelensky promises to make the &quot;victory plan&quot; public. Zelensky has said that the plan is designed to end the war with the backing of international partners, without relying on Russia&apos;s cooperation, though he did not specify how it would achieve this.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelenskys-victory-plan-includes-invitation-to-nato-commitment-to-sustained-weapons-supply-bloomberg-reports/	2024-09-21T07:59:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1526771823.jpg
Russia preparing strikes against Ukrainian nuclear facilities ahead of winter, Foreign Minister says	Moscow is preparing to carry out strikes against Ukrainian nuclear facilities ahead of winter, Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Sept. 21, citing Kyiv&apos;s intelligence data. The possible targets include open distribution devices at nuclear power plants and transmission substations, &quot;which are essential for the safe functioning of the nuclear energy system,&quot; according to Sybiha. &quot;Damage to these facilities would create a high risk of a nuclear incident that will have global consequences,&quot; Sybiha said in a statement published on social media. Ukraine&apos;s special services informed Kyiv&apos;s partners and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) about the possible threat. &quot;Russia is the only country that seized a nuclear power plant in Europe, blackmailing the world,&quot; added the minister. &quot;The Ukrainian peace formula contains a clause on ensuring radiation and nuclear safety. We call on all international organizations and states that respect the U.N. Charter to prevent the scenario of the terrorist country.&quot; The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe&apos;s largest nuclear power station, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. Its position near the front line has led to heightened nuclear safety risks throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Ukraine&apos;s National Resistance Center reported on Sept. 15 that Russian forces continued to use the territory of the occupied power plant to deploy military personnel and store ammunition and explosives and criticized the IAEA for supposedly ignoring the fact. In his Sept. 21 statement, Sybiha thanked the IAEA for agreeing to expand its missions at several energy facilities in Ukraine and called on the agency to implement the decision as quickly as possible. The Ukrainian power grid has been heavily damaged during Russian aerial attacks, and it remains unclear how much of the infrastructure can be repaired before the temperatures drop. Energy deficits necessitated rolling blackouts during the summer and autumn, with some officials warning that Ukrainians may have electricity for 6-7 hours per day in the upcoming winter.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-preparing-strikes-against-ukrainian-nuclear-facilities-ahead-of-winter-foreign-minister-says/	2024-09-21T06:51:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1243158341.jpg
Former Wagner base in Russia's Krasnodar Krai reportedly on fire	A fire broke out at the Wagner Group&apos;s former military base in Molkino in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai on Sept. 21, Russian independent media outlet Meduza reported, citing Wagner-linked Telegram channel. The Molkino camp hosted Wagner mercenaries for almost 10 years and was the group&apos;s main base in Russia. In the summer of 2023, the base was reportedly handed over to the African Corps, a unit consisting of former Wagner fighters subordinate to the Russian Defense Ministry. The African Corps operates in Burkina Faso, Libya, Mali, the Central African Republic, and Niger, according to Meduza. The Wagner Orchestra Telegram channel published on Sept. 21 videos allegedly showing the base&apos;s administrative buildings and the headquarters on fire. It is unclear what caused the fire. The African Corps has not commented on the fire. The Wagner Group played a pivotal role in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, leading Moscow&apos;s assault in the Battle of Bakhmut in the spring of 2023. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the then-leader of Wagner, died in a mysterious plane crash in Russia on Aug. 23, 2023. The crash came two months after Prigozhin led Wagner troops in a short-lived rebellion against the Kremlin. Following Prigozhin&apos;s mutiny and death, the mercenary group withdrew from Ukraine and became fragmented, operating in Belarus and some African nations friendly to Russia. Wagner units were reportedly incorporated into official Russian military structures, such as Rosgvardia. Since the death of Prigozhin, the Wagner Group&apos;s fighting force has significantly decreased, according to the U.K. Defense Ministry.	https://kyivindependent.com/former-wagner-base-in-russias-krasnodar-krai-reportedly-on-fire/	2024-09-21T04:48:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1623017480.jpg
Japanese PM Kishida to meet Zelensky in US, media report	Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida departed on Sept. 21 for his four-day tour in the U.S., where he will reportedly meet President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to Japanese public broadcaster NHK, Kishida is expected to convey Japan&apos;s intention to continue supporting Kyiv and imposing sanctions against Russia during the meeting. Zelensky is soon heading to the U.S. to attend the 79th U.N. General Assembly in New York and present a five-point victory plan to the American leadership. Ukraine&#x2019;s Presidential Office has not announced the meeting with Kishida yet. This will be Kishida&#x2019;s final work trip to the U.S. before stepping down as the Japanese prime minister. He&#x2019;s also expected to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden and attend the U.N. General Assembly, among other events. Since March 2022, Japan has committed over $12 billion in humanitarian, economic, and other assistance to Ukraine. Under a security agreement signed in June, Tokyo pledged to provide Ukraine with an additional $4.5 billion in 2024 and continue supporting the country throughout the next 10 years.	https://kyivindependent.com/japanese-pm-kishida-to-meet-zelensky-in-us-media-report/	2024-09-21T04:04:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1257171526.jpg
Zelensky signs law to increase state budget by $12 billion for defense expenditures	President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a law on Sept. 20 to increase the state budget by Hr 500 billion ($12 billion) to spend on defense and military needs. The law aims to finance &quot;urgent measures in the field of security and defense to counter the large-scale armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine,&quot; according to an explanatory note on the Ukrainian parliament&apos;s website. Roksolana Pidlasa, the head of the Budget Committee, said that the additional $12 billion would mostly be financed through the issuing of domestic government bonds and reducing expenses relating to repaying the state debt. Another Hr 30 billion ($722 million) will come from revenues from tax increases, and Hr 12.7 billion ($306 million) will come from an increase in the excise duty on tobacco and fuel. The law was approved by Ukraine&apos;s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, on Sept. 18. MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak said afterward that this year&apos;s expenditures amounted to a record Hr 3.73 trillion ($89.8 billion). The draft state budget for 2025 foresees Ukraine&apos;s defense spending of Hr 2.2 trillion, which constitutes 26.3% of the country&apos;s projected gross domestic product (GDP), according to Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. Ukraine&apos;s parliament approved on Sept. 17 a bill that proposes a tax increase of Hr 58 billion ($1.4 billion) in 2024 and Hr 137 billion ($3.3 billion) in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-signs-law-to-increase-state-budget-by-12-billion-for-defense-expenditures/	2024-09-21T02:46:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170184779.jpg

Drone strike causes explosions at facility in Krasnodar Krai, Russian officials say	A drone strike in the Tikhoretsk district of Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai caused detonations of &quot;explosive objects&quot; at an unspecified facility, regional Governor Veniamin Kondratyev reported on Sept. 21. The Tikhoretsk district houses a major ammunition depot that has expanded over the last year to accommodate munitions shipments from North Korea, according to the Washington Post. Russian air defense units intercepted two drones over the Tikhoretsk district on Sept. 21, Kondratyev said. &quot;The falling debris of one of them caused a fire that spread to explosive objects. A detonation began,&quot; he said. Local residents are being evacuated from the area near the blast, Kondratyev said. No casualties have been reported. While Kondratyev did not specify where the explosions occurred, the Russian Telegram news channel Astra reported that the Tikhoretsk ammunition depot was hit in the attack. The report comes mere days after Ukraine successfully launched an overnight attack on against one of Russia&apos;s largest arsenals on Sept. 18. Ukrainian drones targeted a weapons depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, built to withstand a nuclear explosion.	https://kyivindependent.com/drone-strike-causes-explosions-at-facility-in-krasnodar-krai-russian-officials-say/	2024-09-20T20:59:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2165561187.jpg
US may send Ukraine medium-range missiles for F-16s, Politico reports	The United States may send Ukraine medium-range missiles for F-16 fighter jets as part of its latest military aid package, Politico reported on Sept. 20, citing unnamed U.S. officials. The U.S. is expected to announce a $375 million military assistance package for Kyiv next week, Reuters reported earlier on Sept. 20. The package represents the largest tranche of U.S. military aid for Ukraine since May 2024. A medium-range glide bomb known as the Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) might be included in the new package, officials told Politico. The missile can cover a distance of over 70 miles. The contents of the package have not been finalized and are subject to change, the officials said. Reuters earlier reported that the U.S. would likely send patrol boats, ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS), artillery shells, and spare parts as part of the latest round of military assistance. The JSOW has a shorter range than U.S.-made Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), long-range missiles that can travel up to 300 kilometers (190 miles). Ukraine has urged Washington to grant permission for Ukrainian troops to use ATACMS to strike military targets located deep inside Russian territory. While JSOW missiles won&apos;t accomplish that goal, the 70-mile range would allow F-16 pilots to keep their distance from the front lines and Russian air defense systems. Ukraine received its first U.S.-made fourth-generation jets in late July and has already deployed F-16s to intercept Russian mass aerial attacks. One aircraft crashed during such a mission, marking Ukraine&apos;s first F-16 loss.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-may-send-ukraine-medium-range-missiles-for-f-16s-politico-reports/	2024-09-20T20:22:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2165218520.jpg
Russian missile strike on Kryvyi Rih kills at least 3, including child	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A Russian missile strike on Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast killed at least three people and injured three others, Oleksandr Vilkul, the city&apos;s military administration head, reported the morning of Sept. 21. A child was killed in the attack, regional Governor Serhii Lysak said. Another victim was an elderly woman who died in an ambulance on the way to the hospital, Vilkul reported. There may still be more victims under the rubble. A Russian missile struck a residential neighborhood in Kryvyi Rih, Vilkul reported. About an hour earlier, the Air Force warned that a ballistic missile was likely headed for the city. The attack damaged a number of houses, Lysak said. &#xA0; Emergency services are at work on the scene, and rescuers are continuing to search amid the rubble. The full consequences of the attack are currently being investigated. Kryvyi Rih, with a population of around 660,000, is the second most populous city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. It has suffered multiple deadly attacks by Russian forces since the outbreak of the full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-strike-on-kryvyi-rih-kills-at-least-3-injures-3-including-children/	2024-09-20T19:11:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1221388130.jpg
49% of Russians support withdrawal of troops from Ukraine, poll says	Nearly 50% of Russian people support withdrawing troops from Ukraine and negotiating for peace, even without achieving the Kremlin&apos;s military objectives, according to a joint survey conducted by independent pollsters ExtremeScan and Chronicles. The figures represent a striking shift from the overwhelming support for the war indicated by past polls. A February survey from the Levada Center, an independent Russian polling organization, found that 77% of Russians supported the full-scale war in Ukraine. According to polls conducted by ExtremeScan and Chronicles in September 2024, 49% of Russians support the immediate withdrawal of troops from Ukraine and peace talks with Kyiv, an increase of nearly 10% from the three previous polls held since February 2023. When asked about Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Kursk Oblast, respondents said it was more important to oust Ukrainian troops from Russian territory than to seize more ground in eastern Ukraine. A majority of those surveyed (53%) said they supported removing Ukrainian forces from Kursk Oblast while only 15% said Russia should occupy more territory in Ukraine. The pollsters also probed the extent to which Russians were willing to support the full-scale invasion. According to the results, 32% are prepared to participate in the war if ordered by the Russian Defense Ministry, while 29% said they are not prepared to fight. Another 29% said they would support a new wave of Russian mobilization. The results are based on responses from 800 interviewees over the age of 18. The poll was timed to coincide with the two-year anniversary of the start of Russia&apos;s mobilization campaign. Both Chronicles and ExtremeScan began as startups in 2022 after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The research projects were initiated by Russian antiwar activists looking to undermine the Kremlin&apos;s claims of broad popular support through innovative polling tactics. &quot;It&apos;s very difficult in a dictatorship, during a war, to get what people are really thinking because they tend to identify themselves with the majority, they tend to lie because they are afraid,&quot; Alexei Minyaylo, founder of Chronicles, told the Moscow Times in October 2022. Polls conducted by Chronicles and ExtremeScan have shown significantly less popular support for the war in Ukraine than those of other major independent polling centers.	https://kyivindependent.com/49-of-russians-support-withdrawal-of-troops-from-ukraine-poll-says/	2024-09-20T18:31:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2165579283.jpg

US Green Party candidate Stein calls Putin 'war criminal,' clarifying stance after controversial interview	U.S. presidential candidate Jill Stein from the left-wing Green Party released a statement on Sept. 19 condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin as a &quot;war criminal.&quot; Stein&apos;s statement said the campaign wanted to &quot;clarify (its) stance on key issues, particularly regarding any misunderstandings regarding...recent comments about Vladimir Putin and (Syrian leader) Bashar al-Assad.&quot; The Sept. 19 statement unequivocally called Putin a war criminal but cited Russia&apos;s &quot;military intervention in Syria,&quot; not the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as an &quot;example of his disregard for human rights.&quot; Stein reiterated previous calls for the need for &quot;diplomacy&quot; and said that &quot;the situation in Ukraine&quot; and other international crises &quot;have created a global environment reminiscent of the prelude to World War I.&quot; She did not call for Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine but instead emphasized the &quot;necessity of engaging with adversaries like Putin to de-escalate tensions and work toward peaceful resolutions.&quot; Ajamu Baraka, Stein&apos;s running mate for the Green Party in 2016, hit back against the statement, saying that &quot;playing to the rightest forces among the left and (Democratic) Party was not necessary.&quot; The comments came days after Stein gave a widely criticized interview with U.K. broadcaster Mehdi Hasan, in which she declined to answer a direct question about whether Putin is a war criminal. &quot;So, what we said about Putin was that his invasion of Ukraine is criminal. It&apos;s a criminal and murderous war,&quot; Stein said in response. When Hasan pressed her, asking, &quot;And he&apos;s a war criminal who should be on trial?&quot; Stein said, &quot;well, by implication, by implication.&quot; Later on in the interview, Hasan again asked Stein the same question point blank &#x2014; &quot;Either you&apos;re a war criminal or you&apos;re not. Is Vladimir Putin a war criminal?&quot; Stein again waffled, saying, &quot;In so many words, yes he is.&quot; But she added, &quot;If you want to pull him back, if you are a world leader, you don&apos;t begin your conversation by calling someone a war criminal.&quot; The Green Party candidate has been previously criticized for her views on Russia and its full-scale war on Ukraine, and has repeated Russian propaganda talking points, such as the false claims that NATO expansion provoked Putin and that the 2014 EuroMaidan revolution was a &quot;coup.&quot; Stein also attended a gala in Moscow in 2015, where she dined at a table with Putin and General Mike Flynn, who previously served as former President Donald Trump&apos;s national security advisor. Polls on the upcoming presidential election have consistently found that Stein is ranking under 2% among likely voters.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-green-party-candidate-stein-calls-putin-war-criminal-clarifying-stance-after-controversial-interview/	2024-09-20T14:48:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2149611594.jpg
‘Russia must feel it’s going to lose’ – Zelensky’s ‘victory plan,’ explained	More than 2.5 years into Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, as Moscow continued to make rapid advances in the east and launch relentless missile attacks across Ukraine, Kyiv seemed to be facing a stark choice: make territorial concessions for an unjust peace or prepare for a prolonged war, sacrificing more lives with no guarantee of success. Then, President Volodymyr Zelensky made an unexpected announcement &#x2013; he has a plan on how to end Russia&#x2019;s war with Ukraine&#x2019;s victory. The so-called &quot;victory plan&quot; was designed to strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s future negotiating position and push Russia to make a just peace. Kyiv remains secretive about the plan&apos;s details as Zelensky prepares to present it to U.S. President Joe Biden and American presidential candidates during his visit to the U.S. next week. The plan is expected to address military, political, diplomatic, and economic strategies. A source close to Zelensky told the Kyiv Independent that the &quot;victory plan&quot; aims &quot;to create such conditions and such an atmosphere that Russia will no longer be able to ignore the peace formula and the peace summit.&quot; As Moscow has maintained initiative on the battlefield in the east of Ukraine for most of the year, it has repeatedly rejected Zelensky&apos;s 10-point peace formula, which calls for a complete Russian troop withdrawal from Ukrainian territory, among other steps. &quot;The problem is, to get to that point where we have any sort of peace negotiations, Russia must feel like they&apos;re going to lose, and we are not there yet,&quot; Rep. Jimmy Panetta, a Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee in Congress, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;I hope part of this victory plan is how we can shape battlefield conditions to reach that point,&quot; said Panetta, who met Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials in Kyiv last weekend. Zelensky announced his team was preparing the &quot;victory plan&quot; as Ukraine gained momentum following its incursion into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, which has widely been considered a successful operation that exposed Russia&#x2019;s inability to defend its own territory and challenged its so-called &quot;red lines.&quot; Kyiv appears to be rushing to secure substantial backing behind its &#x201C;victory plan&#x201D; from Washington ahead of the November election that might bring former President Donald Trump back to the White House and jeopardize the U.S. support for Ukraine. According to Zelensky, for the &quot;victory plan&quot; to work out, allies need to make &#x201C;quick decisions&#x201D; between October and December this year. In a few statements he has made about the &#x201C;victory plan,&#x201D; Zelensky mentioned it consists of four main points, with an additional fifth point to be implemented after hostilities end. The plan focuses on strengthening Ukraine&apos;s defense and creating the conditions to end the war. Zelensky told CNN that the plan covers issues such as security, Ukraine&apos;s geopolitical position, &quot;very strong&quot; defense aid, and economic assistance. In a Sept. 16 address, Zelensky said that curators had been assigned to each area, emphasizing that &quot;nothing is impossible&quot; in the plan. Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office has not responded to the Kyiv Independent&apos;s request for more details on the plan&apos;s contents. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi declined to elaborate but said that the plan &quot;will strengthen Ukraine, Ukrainian warriors, and Ukrainian people.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky addresses the U.S. Congress at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, US on Dec. 21, 2022. (Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images)While Kyiv remains tight-lipped about the plan&apos;s specifics, Ukrainian officials have refuted media reports that it includes a partial ceasefire. &quot;There is not and cannot be any alternative to peace, no freezing of the war or any other manipulations that will simply move Russian aggression to another stage,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address on Sept. 18. Danylo Lubkivskyi, the head of the Kyiv Security Forum, suggested that the victory plan would likely include ramping up sanctions against Russia and ensuring a safe sky over Ukraine, as well as the prospects of Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership and international security guarantees &quot;These elements clearly need to be addressed,&quot; Lubkivskyi told the Kyiv Independent. One of the critical elements of the victory plan is likely the U.S. and other allies&apos; approval for Ukraine to use long-range weapons to target military sites deep inside Russia, a capability experts see as essential for Ukraine to have chances at defeating Moscow. Striking deep inside Russia will enable Ukraine to destroy the airfields from which Russian aircraft are taking off to attack Ukrainian civilian infrastructure as well as degrade Russian air defenses, thus allowing Ukrainian drones to hit key Russian oil and gas infrastructure, according to retired U.S. Lieutenant General Ben Hodges. Oil and gas sales are the key sources for financing Russia&apos;s war machine, with 10.7 trillion rubles ($115 billion) expected in revenue in 2024, up 21% compared to 2023. Long-range strikes will also allow Ukraine to destroy Russia&#x2019;s transportation infrastructure, military headquarters, artillery and rocket positions, airfields, and logistics, &quot;which will degrade Russia&apos;s only advantage &#x2014; mass (numbers),&quot; Hodges told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Without those capabilities, it doesn&apos;t matter how many unlucky, untrained Russian soldiers there are,&quot; he added. Although Western countries eased restrictions on the use of certain Western-provided weapons just across the border following Russia&apos;s May offensive in Kharkiv Oblast, limits on long-range strikes deep within Russia have remained in effect.

(Nikoletta Stoyanova/Getty Images)Hodges expects that during the upcoming U.S. trip, Zelensky will also continue to press for the rapid delivery of some long-promised equipment, munitions, and additional air defense capabilities needed to protect Ukrainian civilians and energy infrastructure ahead of winter. According to Republican Rep. Don Bacon, who also attended the meeting with Zelensky last weekend, one of the victory plan&apos;s priorities seems to be improving cooperation between Ukrainian oblasts and American states. This could mean developing &quot;more connections on the ground with the American public to garner more U.S. support of Ukraine,&quot; according to Panetta. Since November 2022, when various countries began promoting their strategies on how to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, Kyiv has been advocating for its 10-point peace formula, which demands a full withdrawal of Russian forces and accountability for war crimes, among other things. However, this plan struggled to gain support among the nations of the so-called Global South such as Russia-friendly India and China. The introduction of the smaller &#x201C;victory plan&#x201D; doesn&apos;t mean that Ukraine was forced to abandon any points of its peace formula and come up with a more modest strategy, according to Lubkivskyi. Instead, the &#x201C;victory plan&#x201D; likely builds on it, specifying some of its most relevant aspects, the expert believes. Zelensky said that the &#x201C;victory plan&#x201D; could pave the way to a lasting peace, achievable through the full implementation of the peace formula. Throughout the full-scale war, there have been reports of Western pressure on Kyiv to negotiate with Russia, which many Ukrainians fear could result in territorial concessions. These calls apparently intensified in the spring and summer of 2024 as Ukraine experienced a series of setbacks on the battlefield. However, in early August, Ukraine made a move that might have turned the tide of the war.

(Ed Ram/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)On Aug. 6, Kyiv launched a surprise incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast &#x2014; the first invasion of Russian territory by a foreign power since World War II &#x2014; causing talk of peace negotiations to fade. In just several weeks, Ukraine seized around 100 Russian settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles), according to Kyiv. Zelensky soon began speaking of his &#x201C;victory plan,&#x201D; saying that the Kursk operation is an integral part, though the exact role it plays remains undisclosed. &quot;The victory plan clearly takes advantage of the so far successful Kursk operation,&quot; William Taylor, vice president for Europe and Russia at the U.S. Institute of Peace and former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;There&apos;s a new momentum on the battlefield with the Ukrainians on the offensive and taking the initiative&#x2026; I think the actions on the battlefield reinforce the potential of the &#x2018;victory plan.&#x2019;&quot; The &#x201C;victory plan&#x201D; also comes as the U.S. prepares for its presidential election, which could impact future aid to Ukraine. Ukraine is also reportedly planning a second global peace summit with Russia&apos;s potential participation ahead of the election in November. However, the &quot;victory plan&quot; had to be prepared regardless of the U.S. elections, according to Lubkivskyi. Ukrainians and Kyiv&apos;s foreign partners have been long expecting from Kyiv a clear strategy on how Ukraine sees the victory over Russia, Lubkivskyi said, calling the plan&apos;s creation &quot;a politically important step.&quot; &quot;The logic of constantly proposing new steps, offering tools (to ensure Ukraine&apos;s victory), must be followed regardless of political events in certain states,&quot; he added. &quot;The pressure must continue. This is the main guarantee of our success. And the bar must be kept high.&quot; Participants pose for a photograph during the Global Peace Summit at the Burgenstock resort, Switzerland, on June 15, 2024. (Michael Buholzer/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)Will the plan work?Biden will be the first in the U.S. to see the full &#x201C;victory plan&#x201D; next week. After that, Zelensky aims to present it to presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, as well as members of Congress. Zelensky explained that the plan is designed to end the war with the backing of international partners, without relying on Russia&apos;s cooperation, though he did not specify how it would achieve this. &quot;The &#x2018;victory plan&#x2019; will focus on pushing the Russians back with military support, as well as strong backing from Europeans and Americans,&quot; said Taylor. He added that once Putin realizes, through this plan and international support, that victory is unattainable, he will seek a way out. Some U.S. officials have already seen parts of Zelensky&apos;s plan and believe it is a strategy &quot;that can work,&quot; U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said during a press briefing on Sept. 17. Thomas-Greenfield added the U.S. plans to promote the plan among world leaders during the upcoming U.N. General Assembly in New York, which Zelensky will attend. When asked if Trump, who has repeatedly claimed he could end the war &quot;in 24 hours,&quot; is likely to support Zelensky&apos;s plan, Taylor said it&apos;s uncertain but emphasized that &quot;we do know where the American people are.&quot; U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris (L) shakes hands with Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky during a meeting on the sideline of the Summit on peace in Ukraine, at the luxury Burgenstock resort, near Lucerne, Switzerland on June 15, 2024. (Alessandro Della Valle/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)&quot;There are strong supporters of Ukraine in the Congress, House, and Senate, who will have an influence on former President Trump if he&apos;s reelected.&quot; According to Panetta, the &#x201C;victory plan&quot; &quot;serves as an answer&quot; to the Republicans in Congress who voted against the $61 billion aid package for Ukraine in April, citing the absence of a clear strategy for Ukraine&apos;s victory. Taylor also suggested Zelensky&apos;s U.S. visit could be pivotal in securing approval for Ukraine to use West-provided long-range weapons against targets deep inside Russia. He compared this potential shift to the U.S. secretly providing Ukraine with ATACMS missiles in March, revealed only after the first attack on Crimea. &quot;I think there&apos;s a very good chance that either quietly or publicly, the United States, Great Britain, France, and others will give the Ukrainians the green light to use these weapons against military targets in compliance with international law sometime over the next week or so,&quot; he said.

US to provide Ukraine with additional $375 million in military aid, Reuters reports	The U.S. will provide Ukraine with an additional package of $375 million in military aid, Reuters reported on Sept. 20, citing two unnamed U.S. government officials. The announcement of the package is expected sometime next week, the officials said. Foreign military assistance is crucial for Kyiv as the all-out war with Russia stretches past two and half years, with Russian forces pushing hard in Ukraine&apos;s east. If confirmed, it would be the largest tranche of military aid the U.S. has sent Ukraine since May earlier this year, when a package worth $275 million was delivered. The officials said the package would likely include patrol boats, ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS), artillery shells, spare parts, and other military equipment. The exact quantities were not specified. The previous day, Reuters reported that Congress and the administration of President Joe Biden are close to an agreement on a one-year extension of $5.8 billion in military aid for Ukraine before it expires at the end of September. After the House of Representatives failed to pass a Republican-backed spending bill on Sept. 18 that did not include the PDA extension, the Democratic-led Senate said it would prepare a new bill to avert a shutdown. The sources told Reuters that the Senate bill should include the prolongation of the Ukraine aid funds. It remains unclear whether Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who delayed a $61 billion aid bill for Kyiv for months earlier this year, will support it. The $61 billion assistance package was eventually passed in April, allocating some $7.8 billion to the PDA and allowing the release of a number of defense aid tranches since then.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-provide-ukraine-with-additional-375-million-in-military-aid/	2024-09-20T13:13:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1241658570-1658486054djzog.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia commanders reportedly warned of plans for Ukraine's Kursk incursion months in advance	Key developments on Sept. 20: Russian commanders anticipated that Ukraine was planning an incursion into Kursk Oblast months before it occurred, the Guardian reported on Sept. 20, citing a collection of documents that Ukrainian soldiers said they had seized from abandoned Russian positions. The documents included printed orders and handwritten entries from commanders. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in early August, claiming to have seized around 100 settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles). Russia appeared to have been taken by surprise by the attack, which allowed Ukrainian forces to quickly fan out across the border and move deep into Russian territory. According to the seized documents, the authenticity of which the Guardian said they &quot;could not independently verify,&quot; Russian commanders had been cautioning that a potential cross-border breakthrough could occur as far back as January 2024. While the earlier warnings were largely vague, they grew increasingly more detailed &#x2014; including specific threats that Ukraine would try to seize the town of Sudzha &#x2014; a warning that was realized after Ukraine captured it in August. The seized documents also revealed that Russian commanders had attempted to beef up security by the border in Kursk Oblast and &quot;organize additional exercises for the leadership of units and strongpoints regarding the proper organization of defenses&quot; ahead of a possible Ukrainian attack. Other revelations from the documents were statements from commanders about the deteriorating morale of Russian soldiers in the area. &quot;The analysis of the current situation regarding suicides shows that the issue of servicemen dying as a result of suicidal incidents remains tense,&quot; one entry read. Another entry detailed the specifics of one soldier&apos;s suicide. &quot;The investigation into the incident determined that the cause of the suicide and death was a nervous and psychological breakdown, caused by his prolonged state of depression due to his service in the Russian army,&quot; the entry read. Commanders also wrote instructions on how to improve morale, including one suggestion that soldiers should receive daily political lessons &quot;aimed at maintaining and raising the political, moral, and psychological condition of the personnel.&quot; The surviving members of a group of 14 men from Ghana who were lured into the Russian military to fight against Ukraine have appealed for help from Russian-occupied Donetsk Oblast, Ghanaian news outlet TV3 reported on Sept. 19. Russia continues to try to fill the ranks of its army with foreigners and migrant workers to avoid another round of domestic mobilization as losses from its ongoing war in Ukraine mount. According to TV3, the men arrived in Russia on Aug. 6 and were taken to Kostroma, a city in western Russia located 300 kilometers (186 miles) northeast of Moscow. Another man from Ghana was reportedly responsible for luring the group, promising them well-paid jobs in Russia. The men said they paid for their own plane tickets and visas and were told they would get a job working in security, but would first undergo training from the military. The men said they then signed a contract in Russian, a language none of the men speak, and their passports were later confiscated. Three men from the group told TV3 that they are being held against their will in Russian-occupied Donetsk Oblast and that they believe they may be the only surviving members of the original group of 14. Other members of the group were allegedly taken away to fight and one man escaped, but his whereabouts are unknown. &quot;We are presently in Ukraine...we have no fighting experience,&quot; one man told TV3. &quot;We are pleading, we want to return home.&quot; The families of the 14 men have appealed to the Ghanian Police Headquarters for help, TV3 journalist Godwin Asediba posted on X on Sept. 20. Similar cases of foreigners being lured into the Russian army have been reported in India, Egypt, Nepal, and Cuba, despite efforts from these countries to clamp down on the smuggling rings and recruitment schemes that drive men to Russia. The first cohort of Ukrainian pilots have completed Alpha Jet training in France, the French Armed Forces announced on Sept. 20. The French Air Force has been training Ukrainian pilots since March 2024 as part of the international coalition to provide Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets, which was founded at the NATO summit in Vilnius in July 2023. Kyiv has been calling for its partners to provide F-16s jets since the very first year of the full-scale war in order to bolster its fleet of aircraft, which is otherwise made up of Soviet-made planes. While Ukraine has been promised nearly 80 jets from the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, and Norway, the training of new pilots has been considered one of the main bottlenecks for expanding Ukraine&apos;s F-16 capabilities. The French Armed Forces wrote on X that the Alpha Jet training program shows &quot;France&apos;s firm support for the Ukrainian war effort,&quot; but did not provide further details. French newspaper Le Monde reported in June that the French Air Force had committed to training 26 Ukrainian pilots. This number is significant as the French Air Force usually certifies around 30 pilots a year, after up to five years of training. The program began in March with 10 Ukrainian pilots, who are training using Alphajets fitted with a panel that simulates the instruments in the cockpit of an F-16, Le Monde said. A group of Ukrainian pilots also recently arrived in Romania to start training on F-16 fighter jets, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Sept. 12. Other Ukrainian pilots have undergone training in the U.S. or Denmark, though Copenhagen said it would not provide instructions to Ukrainian aviators on its territory past 2024. Ukraine&apos;s drone strike on the arms depot in Russia&apos;s Tver Oblast destroyed two to three months&apos; worth of munitions, Estonian Colonel Ants Kiviselg, head of the Estonian Defense Forces Intelligence Center, said on Sept. 20. Ukraine launched an overnight attack on Sept. 18 against one of the largest arsenals in Russia, opened in 2018 and built to withstand a nuclear explosion. According to Estonian news outlet ERR, Kiviselg commented on the strike during an Estonian Defense Ministry press conference. Ukraine was able to strike the depot because some of the ammunition was not located inside bunkers, causing a chain of explosions that destroyed 30,000 tons of ammunition to explode, Kiviselg said. &quot;At an average rate of military action, Russia fires 10,000 shells per week. That is, a two-to-three-month supply of ammunition,&quot; &quot;We will see the consequences of this loss at the front in the coming weeks,&quot; Kiviselg said. The arms depot in Topolets stored ballistic missiles, including Iskanders, anti-aircraft missiles, artillery ammunition, and KAB guided bombs, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine told the Kyiv Independent. Ukraine has long suffered a disadvantage in terms of ammunition supplies compared to Russia. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi told CNN on Sept. 5 that Russian forces currently fire shells at a ratio of around 2:1 to 2.5:1 to Ukrainian forces. Norway&apos;s civil and military support program for Ukraine, known as the Nansen program, will be extended until 2030 and will be increased by a further 5 billion kroner ($475 million) this year, Oslo announced on Sept. 20. The Nansen program will now have a total value of 135 billion kroner ($12.8 billion). The program initially was set to spend 75 billion kroner ($7 billion) from 2023 to 2028. Oslo&apos;s decision will result in an additional $5.7 billion in Norwegian support for Ukraine until 2030, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X. Zelensky said he was grateful to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store and all political parties in the Norwegian Parliament. &quot;This unwavering commitment will help Ukraine protect lives, defend freedom, and strengthen our resilience,&quot; Zelensky said. Norwegian news outlet Nettavisen said that the decision to expand the Nansen program came after the government &quot;received massive criticism because Norway&apos;s support for Ukraine has lagged behind, compared to other countries.&quot; Almost all Norwegian opposition parties demanded a significant increase in support for Ukraine, Nettavisen said. Norway is ranked 12th in the world in terms of the amount of aid provided to Ukraine, having so far provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian, financial, and military support, according to the Kiel Institute&apos;s Ukraine Support Tracker.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-31/	2024-09-20T12:02:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166312567.jpg

Bloomberg reported in June that Russia was coercing African students and migrants to fight by threatening to take away their visas if they did not agree to join the military. Indian media reported on Sept. 12 that 45 Indians tricked into joining the Russian military fighting in Ukraine have been released after the Indian government intervened, and Russian President Vladimir Putin met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in July.	https://kyivindependent.com/ghana-men-russia-appeal-for-help/	2024-09-20T11:32:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1763145621.jpg

Norway is ranked 12th in the world in terms of the amount of aid provided to Ukraine, having so far provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian, financial, and military support, according to the Kiel Institute&apos;s Ukraine Support Tracker.	https://kyivindependent.com/norway-additional-5-7-billion-to-ukraine/	2024-09-20T09:01:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1623063883.jpg
Norway allocates additional $5.7 billion to Ukraine until 2030	Norway&apos;s civil and military support program for Ukraine, known as the Nansen program, will be extended until 2030 and will be increased by a further 5 billion kroner ($475 million) this year, Oslo announced on Sept. 20. The Nansen program will now have a total value of 135 billion kroner ($12.8 billion). The program initially was set to spend 75 billion kroner ($7 billion) from 2023 to 2028. Oslo&apos;s decision will result in an additional $5.7 billion in Norwegian support for Ukraine until 2030, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X. Zelensky said he was grateful to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store and all political parties in the Norwegian Parliament. &quot;This unwavering commitment will help Ukraine protect lives, defend freedom, and strengthen our resilience,&quot; Zelensky said.

Raiffeisen Bank agrees to sell Belarusian subsidiary	Austria-headquartered Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) agreed to sell its stake in its Belarusian subsidiary Priorbank, marking the first step toward fully withdrawing from the Belarusian market, RBI announced on Sept. 20. RBI has come under heavy criticism from Western institutions since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine for continuing its business in Russia and Belarus, thereby fuelling Russia&apos;s war through paying taxes. Raiffeisen is the largest remaining Western bank in Russia. Hesitant to fully withdraw from the Russian market, the bank eventually announced in July 2024 that it would &quot;drastically&quot; reduce its operations in the country. The decision came after the European Parliament sent Austrian officials a letter in April, urging them to compel Raiffeisen to cease its activities in Russia in compliance with EU sanctions. The European Central Bank has also asked Raiffeisen to scale back its business in Russia by 2026. RBI said it had signed an agreement to sell its 87.74% stake in Priorbank to Soven 1 Holding Limited, an investor from the United Arab Emirates, after more than six months of negotiations. The sale is expected to create a loss of around 300 million euros ($335 million), &quot;which essentially results from the difference between the purchase price and the book value of the equity of Priorbank,&quot; RBI said. With the completion of this transaction to sell Priorbank, &quot;RBI will successfully withdraw from the Belarusian market and thus reduce operational complexity in line with its risk mitigation strategy in Eastern Europe,&quot; the Sept. 20 press release said. Earlier in September, a Russian court issued a preliminary ruling that banned the transfer of Raiffeisen shares. &quot;This complicates the sales process&quot; and will &quot;inevitably lead to further delays&quot; in Raiffeisen&apos;s exit from Russia, RBI said.	https://kyivindependent.com/raiffeisen-bank-sells-belarusian/	2024-09-20T08:00:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167927718.jpg
First group of Ukrainian pilots complete French jet training	The first cohort of Ukrainian pilots have completed Alpha Jet training in France, the French Armed Forces announced on Sept. 20. The French Air Force has been training Ukrainian pilots since March 2024 as part of the international coalition to provide Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets, which was founded at the NATO summit in Vilnius in July 2023. &#xA0; &#xA0; Kyiv has been calling for its partners to provide F-16s jets since the very first year of the full-scale war in order to bolster its fleet of aircraft, which is otherwise made up of Soviet-made planes. While Ukraine has been promised nearly 80 jets from the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, and Norway, the training of new pilots has been considered one of the main bottlenecks for expanding Ukraine&apos;s F-16 capabilities. Photos released by the French Air Force upon the completion of the training program for Ukrainian pilots on Sept. 20, 2024. (French Air and Space Force / X)Photos released by the French Air Force upon the completion of the training program for Ukrainian pilots on Sept. 20, 2024. (French Air and Space Force / X)The French Armed Forces wrote on X that the Alpha Jet training program shows &quot;France&apos;s firm support for the Ukrainian war effort,&quot; but did not provide further details. French newspaper Le Monde reported in June that the French Air Force had committed to training 26 Ukrainian pilots. This number is significant as the French Air Force usually certifies around 30 pilots a year, after up to five years of training. The program began in March with 10 Ukrainian pilots, who are training using Alphajets fitted with a panel that simulates the instruments in the cockpit of an F-16, Le Monde said. A group of Ukrainian pilots also recently arrived in Romania to start training on F-16 fighter jets, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Sept. 12. Other Ukrainian pilots have undergone training in the U.S. or Denmark, though Copenhagen said it would not provide instructions to Ukrainian aviators on its territory past 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-pilots-complete-french-jet-training/	2024-09-20T06:39:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2157350567.jpg
Russia missile strike on Odesa injures 4, damages civilian vessel	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story. Russian forces attacked Odesa on Sept. 20, injuring four people, Governor Oleh Kiper reported. According to the preliminary data, Russia launched Iskander-M ballistic missiles, damaging port and civilian infrastructure, as well as a civilian ship under the Antiguan flag. An air raid alert sounded in Odesa Oblast at around 2 p.m. local time, and the first explosions were heard in the city a few minutes later. Odesa Oblast and other southern regions of Ukraine are regular targets of Russian missile and drone attacks. Russian troops attacked Odesa Oblast with a ballistic missile on July 4, killing one civilian, injuring seven others, and hitting port infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-strikes-odesa/	2024-09-20T06:02:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158388860.jpg
Ukraine approves new domestic-made all-terrain amphibious vehicle Takha	Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry has authorized the use of the all-terrain amphibious vehicle Takha for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, according to its Sept. 20 statement. The vehicle developed by Ukrainian engineers is already being used at the front line for evacuation, as well as for transportation of ammunition and food, according to the ministry. The Takha vehicle is small in size and can turn around on the spot, making it effective in maneuvering in limited spaces. It can also operate in swamps, floodplains, deep snow, and driving out of water on ice. The pressure on the surface created by its tires is less than that of a human foot, which allows it to move on loose and unstable ground, the statement read. The Takha vehicle can also overcome obstacles over one meter high and can carry up to one metric ton of cargo or up to 10 passengers. Its speed on land reaches 40 km/h (25 mph), and on water up to 6 km/h (3.7 mph). The all-terrain vehicle has several fuel tanks and can operate for over two days at a single refueling station. Over 110 models of Ukrainian and foreign-made military vehicles had been approved for use in Ukraine as of early June, the ministry said. One-third of the vehicles were reportedly domestically produced, while the rest were made in over 20 countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Sweden, and Italy.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-approves-takha/	2024-09-20T05:46:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/84901dbb5f3b4fb0031a2a929cc6535c1d6f3c36.jpg
Putin won't visit ICC member Mexico for President-elect Sheinbaum's inauguration	Russian President Vladimir Putin will not fly to Mexico for the inauguration of President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum, a Russian Foreign Ministry official said in an interview with RTVI channel on Sept. 20. The director of the ministry&apos;s Latin American Department, Alexander Shchetinin, confirmed that Russia had received an invitation from Mexico but said that Putin&apos;s representative would attend the inauguration instead. Mexico signed the Rome Statute in 2005 and is subject to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which issued an arrest warrant for Putin last year. Ukraine asked the Mexican government to arrest Putin in accordance with the ICC warrant if he attended the inauguration of Sheinbaum on Oct. 1. The Mexican government said it would not accommodate Kyiv&apos;s request. Shchetinin did not give a reason for Putin&apos;s decision not to travel to Mexico but said that &quot;Moscow was acting within the existing protocol practice and the obligations of the Russian leader.&quot; In early September, Putin visited Mongolia at the invitation of Mongolian President Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh. This was his first trip to an ICC member country that has ratified the Rome Statute since the warrant was issued. The ICC issued an arrest warrant for Putin in March 2023 for the forcible transfer of children from Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine. Both Ukraine and the West called on Mongolia to arrest the Russian president. After the country failed to do so, Heorhii Tykhyi, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry, said that Mongolia would face &quot;consequences&quot; for its decision.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-wont-fly-to-mexico/	2024-09-20T05:25:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169640595.jpg
Meta’s ban on Russian propaganda doesn’t go far enough, say disinformation experts	Tech companies&apos; recent efforts to crack down on Russian propaganda on social media are unlikely to hamper Moscow&#x2019;s campaign to undermine support for Ukraine, especially as major platforms, like X and Telegram, fail to take action. Tech giant Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, banned Russian state-run media outlets like RT and Rossiya Segodnya from its sites on Sept. 17 over &#x201C;foreign interference activity,&#x201D; a Meta spokesperson told the Kyiv Independent. The decision came days after the U.S. claimed that RT was collaborating with Russian intelligence to target countries globally amid a heavy-handed crackdown on the Kremlin&#x2019;s disinformation campaigns. Meta warned that Russia remains the number one source of information warfare, pointing to the Kremlin&#x2019;s coordinated propaganda operation, codenamed &#x201C;Doppelganger,&#x201D; as its &#x201C;most persistent&#x201D; operation since 2017. Doppelganger clones legitimate news and government websites to disseminate anti-Western, pro-Russian, and anti-Ukrainian narratives that are then shared on social media by bots. Screenshot of Russia Today&apos;s (RT) Facebook page is not available. (The Kyiv Independent)Meta&#x2019;s ban may not be enough to suppress Russia&#x2019;s attempts to shape the narrative in key countries and grind down support for Ukraine among its allies. Moreover, X and Telegram &#x2014; platforms where Russian propaganda runs wild &#x2014; have done nothing to curb it. Even X&#x2019;s owner, billionaire Elon Musk, has shared Kremlin propaganda on his X account. Anti-Ukraine Kremlin propaganda on social media that seeks to undermine Kyiv&#x2019;s international credibility has even caused delays in vital arms shipments, said Ruslan Deynychenko, a founder of Ukrainian fact-checker StopFake who works with Meta. He points to an X post by far-right Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene that called funding for Ukraine &#x201C;the most corrupt money scheme of any foreign war in (the U.S&#x2019;) history,&#x201D; and linked to a Kremlin propaganda source that claimed Kyiv&#x2019;s politicians were suddenly earning millions of dollars. U.S. auditors found no evidence of flagrant misuse of financial aid to Ukraine after setting up an anti-corruption working group at the start of 2023. &#x201C;(Russia&#x2019;s) efforts are very effective. They make our efforts to defend our country less effective,&#x201D; Deynychenko told the Kyiv Independent. Content labeled Russian propaganda by Meta skyrocketed following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. The company took quick action by blocking ads from Russian state-media, and restricting visibility on users&#x2019; feeds, Meta told the Kyiv Independent. As a result, Russian propaganda posts fell by 43% and engagement levels dropped by 80% by Aug. 24, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, according to an external analysis by Graphika, a social media analysis company. A Russia state-controlled Russia Today&apos;s (RT) television broadcast van is seen parked in front of St. Basil&apos;s Cathedral and the Kremlin next to Red Square in Moscow, Russia on March 16, 2018. (Mladen Antonov / AFP via Getty Images)While praising Meta&#x2019;s latest steps, Deynychenko believes it is mostly &#x201C;symbolic,&#x201D; noting that Russian propagandists will find workarounds. To avoid Meta&#x2019;s previous restrictions, propagandists set up Facebook pages that seemingly have no connection to the Kremlin, like a page dedicated to soap operas, and disseminated propaganda there, he said. What&apos;s more, the ban is limited to Russian state-backed media and doesn&#x2019;t cover &#x2018;alternative&#x2019; news sites and commentators that espouse Russian propaganda, said Christian Mamo, founding member of Dutch-based non-profit group Osint for Ukraine. He points to The Grayzone, a U.S.-based media, which is still active on Facebook despite its founder Max Blumenthal frequently writing for and appearing on RT. &#x201C;Movements and individuals expressing pro-Russian views in the Western world don&apos;t get their narratives directly from RT, rather from localized institutions, &#x2018;influencers,&#x2019; and political movements and online commentators,&#x201D; Mamo told the Kyiv Independent, adding that Meta&#x2019;s decision won&#x2019;t achieve much with these restrictions. A Tennessee-based &#x201C;independent&#x201D; media platform, Tenet Media, was discovered last month to have received financing from Russia and hosted several prominent alt-right journalists who frequently criticized Ukraine and NATO. The U.S. Justice Department charged two RT employees for violating foreign agent and money laundering laws over funding the network. If the ban doesn&#x2019;t have any sincere impact, then Russia will continue eroding support for Ukraine and fomenting division in Europe, said Vadym Miskyi, program director of Detector Media, a Ukrainian think-tank. In the worst case scenario, it could lead to a drop in public and political will to support Kyiv long-term and cripple Ukraine&#x2019;s defense, he added. Russia doesn&#x2019;t just target Westerners but also Ukrainians, largely through Telegram, the number one source for news in Ukraine. Rather than promoting a pro-Russian agenda, Telegram accounts often disguise themselves as pro-Ukrainian but propagate demoralizing messages to push Ukraine to give up. They accuse the government of corruption or criticize the mobilization effort which is largely unpopular among civilians. Other narratives emphasize the mass losses of Ukrainians on the frontline or disunity among Ukrainian allies, said Mamo. But it is on X that Russian propaganda has the most credibility. Since Musk&#x2019;s takeover in 2022, Russian narratives have bled into X&#x2019;s mainstream discourse and are even amplified on Musk&#x2019;s personal account, noted Mamo. X did not reply to the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s request for comment. Russian propagandists use X to promote anti-Ukrainian or pro-Russian narratives to an international audience, where it reaches journalists and traditional media that cover Ukraine, said Deynychenko. The propaganda is more sophisticated than other platforms, he claims, and voices like Musk add a certain authority when they share disinformation or memes. pic.twitter.com/W9i9YEM8uA In one instance, Musk shared a meme created by the Kremlin-backed organization the Social Design Agency (ASD), a joint investigation by over a dozen European newsrooms revealed. The meme, which mocks President Volodymyr Zelensky asking the U.S. for vital financial aid, has been viewed over 95 million times with 831,000 likes since it was posted in October 2023. Memes satirizing Ukraine&#x2019;s war efforts and political figures are particularly effective, says Deynychenko. Social media users are more likely to share memes they find funny over news stories, and humor is an effective shield against fact-checkers, he stressed. &#x201C;You cannot debunk humor and satire. You might look stupid when you debunk something that&apos;s circulating in the form of a meme or some other kind of joke,&#x201D; Deynychenko said.	https://kyivindependent.com/metas-ban-on-russian-propaganda-doesnt-go-far-enough-say-disinformation-experts/	2024-09-20T04:54:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/upd_GettyImages-986845144.jpg
Ukraine restricts Telegram use for government, military, critical infrastructure	Ukraine&apos;s National Coordination Center for Cybersecurity on Sept. 20 restricted the use of Telegram messenger for government agencies, military, and critical infrastructure facilities. Telegram remains one of the most popular social media platforms among Ukrainians. A September 2023 poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology indicated that 44% of Ukrainians use Telegram to receive information and news. The app is also actively used by Russia, its military forces, and intelligence services to undermine Ukraine&apos;s war effort and boost its own. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, earlier called the messenger app &quot;harmful&quot; and a &quot;threat to our national security.&quot; During a recent meeting of the National Security and Defense Council, Budanov provided &quot;substantiated evidence&quot; that Russian intelligence services have access to Telegram users&apos; personal correspondence, even deleted messages, and their personal data. &quot;I have always advocated freedom of speech, but the issue of Telegram is not a matter of freedom of speech, it is a matter of national security,&quot; Budanov said. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said that Telegram is actively used by Russia for cyberattacks, spreading phishing and malware, establishing user geolocation, and adjusting missile strikes against Ukrainian cities and villages. As a result, Ukraine&apos;s cybersecurity center decided to ban the Telegram app on official devices of government officials, military personnel, employees of the security and defense sector, and critical infrastructure enterprises. The only exceptions will be those for whom the use of this messenger is &quot;part of their official duties,&quot; according to the statement. The popularity of Telegram in Ukraine skyrocketed after the start of the invasion in 2022, particularly due to its anonymous channels that mass-spread content to subscribers while preserving the full anonymity of the publisher. Telegram CEO and co-founder Pavel Durov was briefly detained in France and later charged with &quot;complicity in managing an online platform to allow illicit transactions by an organized group&quot; and other crimes. Russian-born Durov has claimed he is a pariah and has been effectively exiled from Russia, but on Aug. 27, it was reported he had visited Russia over 60 times since leaving the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-restricts-telegram-for-government/	2024-09-20T04:31:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168240257.jpg
Russia struggles to rewire global trade amid sanctions, war, WSJ analysis says	Russia tried to establish ties with China and India in an effort to decouple from the West but faced new challenges along the way, The Wall Street Journal&apos;s (WSJ) analysis published on Sept. 20 said. As the full-scale invasion continues, Western countries are imposing increasingly severe sanctions on Russia, forcing it to seek new partnerships with China and India. Following the beginning of the all-out war, Russian trade with China, India, and other eastern countries increased, partially due to the sale of Russian oil at discounts. Cooperation with eastern partners was also facilitated by the fact that tankers could transport oil instead of stationary pipelines. Russia was thus able to circumvent the Western price cap by transporting oil through a so-called shadow fleet of outdated tankers that were not subject to sanctions. This mobility has been crucial for Russia&apos;s resource-dependent economy, helping the Kremlin raise revenue to finance the war and support the sanctions-hit economy, according to the analysis. In 2023, half of Russia&apos;s oil and petroleum product exports went to China, and India also became a major buyer, the media outlet said. Redirecting natural gas proved to be more problematic, as most of Russia&apos;s exports went to Europe, particularly through the Nord Stream pipeline, which was cut off in 2022. Russia currently has limited capacity to transport gas to China, and Beijing has not yet authorized the construction of the Power of Siberia-2 gas pipeline between the two countries. Natural gas can also be liquefied and transported on specialized tankers, but U.S. sanctions limit Russia&apos;s ability to do so. Russia is trying to expand its outdated railroad infrastructure to Asia, as existing lines cannot cope with the growing trade volume. Bureaucratic disputes over capacity allocation have affected the rail-dependent coal industry. The sector, which had priority access to the railroad, now competes with other cargoes, including timber, steel, and containerized shipping, bringing Chinese goods instead of European ones. Meanwhile, the analysis said that Russian coal exports to China are currently stagnating. Moscow was counting on the melting ice in the Arctic Ocean to make the shipping route through Russia&apos;s northern waters a center of global trade, but U.S. sanctions have prevented Russia from getting icebreakers. Russia also seeks to reduce the time it takes to export to the Indian market by using the so-called North-South transport corridor through Iran. Yet the lack of rail infrastructure in Iran, limited port capacity, and uncertainty over funding sources are delaying plans to make this route viable, the WSJ said, citing experts. Russia has been adapting to Western sanctions, using smuggling and various schemes to acquire the sanctioned goods. Last December, Ukraine&apos;s state agency released a report listing roughly 2,500 foreign-made components found in Russian weaponry on the battlefield, with roughly three-quarters originating in the U.S. Russia&apos;s allies transfer the required goods through third countries, bypassing sanctions. China, which has declared itself neutral in the war between Ukraine and Russia, is nevertheless one of Russia&apos;s largest suppliers of dual-use goods. A historical ally of Russia, India has maintained its close economic and diplomatic ties with Moscow since February 2022, with bilateral trade reaching a historic high in 2023. India overtook China as the world&#x2019;s largest importer of Russian oil in July as Chinese refiners bought less due to lower profit margins from fuel production, Reuters reported on Aug. 22, citing a comparison of import data. The Financial Times reported on Sept. 5 that Russia and India developed covert trade links so that the Kremlin could acquire components needed for its war effort. Citing Russian state correspondence seen by the outlet, the Kremlin&apos;s industry and trade ministry acquired critical electronics and explored the possibility of building facilities in India to produce them. The documents showed the plan was to be financed by &quot;significant reserves&quot; of rupees amassed from oil sales to &#xA0;and would source goods &quot;previously supplied from unfriendly countries.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-and-global-economy-wsj/	2024-09-20T04:12:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170784701.jpg
American pro-Kremlin fighter tortured to death by Russian soldiers, Russian investigators say	Russell Bentley, a pro-Kremlin American man who fought against Ukraine in 2014 and was killed under previously unknown circumstances in April, was tortured to death by Russian soldiers, Russia&apos;s Investigative Committee said on Sept. 20. Concluding a preliminary investigation into the case, the committee accused Russian military service members Vitaly Vansyatsky, Vladislav Agaltsev, Vladimir Bazhin, and Andrei Iordanov of taking part in the crime in various roles. Bentley, who died at the age of 63-64, was a U.S. military veteran and self-identified supporter of Russian occupation forces in Ukraine. Local occupation authorities claimed Bentley went missing on April 8 after a district in occupied Donetsk Oblast was shelled by Ukrainian troops. His wife reportedly told the Mash Telegram channel that he went to see if other residents needed help after the strikes and never returned. Russia&apos;s investigative committee concluded that Vansyatsky, Agaltsev, and Iordanov tortured and killed Bentley in occupied Donetsk, Ukraine, on April 8. Vansyatsky and Agaltsev then allegedly denoted a car with his body the same day. On April 9, Vansyatsky instructed Bazhin to cover up the crime by removing Bentley&apos;s remains from the scene, the investigators said. The statement did not name a possible motive for the alleged crime. The committee submitted its conclusions to the court. The soldiers have been charged with abuse of power resulting in death, desecrating a body, and concealment of a crime. Russia was actively recruiting and transporting foreign fighters to join Moscow-backed proxy forces in Donbas at the start of the war in 2014, heavily employing propaganda for that purpose. Bentley, who was a self-described communist and spent five years in a U.S. prison for smuggling, said he had joined Russian proxy forces to fight &quot;against fascism,&quot; reiterating Russian propaganda talking points about the &quot;fascist-ruled&quot; government in Kyiv. The Texas native also launched his own YouTube channel and worked as a &quot;war correspondent&quot; for the Russian propaganda channel Sputnik.	https://kyivindependent.com/american-pro-kremlin-fighter-tortured-killed-by-russian-soldiers-investigators-say/	2024-09-20T03:48:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GKfQq2NWkAAYkwh.jpeg
EU's von der Leyen unveils up to 35 billion euro loan to Ukraine as part of G7 pledge	European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Sept. 20 announced a loan of up to 35 billion euros ($39 billion) to Ukraine as part of a $50-billion pledge by the G7. &quot;Relentless Russian attacks means Ukraine needs continued EU support,&quot; the chief of the EU&apos;s executive arm said during her visit to Kyiv. &quot;The European Commission will provide a loan of up to 35 billion euros to Ukraine as part of the G7 pledge. This is another major EU contribution to Ukraine&apos;s recovery.&quot; Von der Leyen arrived in Ukraine&apos;s capital earlier on Sept. 20 to discuss Europe&apos;s support in various areas &quot;from winter preparedness to defense, to accession and progress on the G7 loans.&quot; The G7 agreed in June to provide Ukraine with a loan of $50 billion by the end of the year, covered by proceeds from immobilized Russian assets. The plan now stands on shaky ground as the U.S., which was supposed to shoulder $20 billion of the sum, is reluctant to commit unless the EU extends the sanctions immobilizing Russian assets. Such a step requires a unanimous vote, which is currently being blocked by Hungary, the EU&apos;s most Kremlin-proximate member. The Financial Times (FT) reported on Sept. 17 that the EU is now drafting plans to provide the loan with or without U.S. support, aiming to gather between 20 billion and 40 billion euros ($22.3-44.5 billion). The outlet comments that the sum of 35 billion euros is a compromise that will allow Washington to step in at a later date. Ukraine is in dire need of such a financial injection as Russia targets its energy infrastructure with missiles and drones and presses its ground offensive in the east. President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the G7 for the pledged $50 billion loan but also urged the creation of a mechanism for the full confiscation of $300 billion in frozen Russian funds. Roughly two-thirds are held at Belgium-based financial service company Euroclear.	https://kyivindependent.com/von-der-leyen-35-billion/	2024-09-20T03:05:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2157219393.jpg
Europe too 'reticent' in energy support for Ukraine ahead of winter, IEA chief says	The head of the International Energy Agency (IEA), Fatih Birol, criticized European governments for being too &quot;reticent&quot; in supporting Ukraine&apos;s energy sector ahead of winter, the third one since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, The Financial Times (FT) reported on Sept. 20. Russia launched nine coordinated attacks against Ukraine&apos;s electricity infrastructure between March and the end of August, striking facilities in 20 oblasts. According to the IEA report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand. This summer, the power shortage was 2.5 GW when Kyiv was already experiencing long blackouts. &quot;It&apos;s time for everybody to understand that this winter could be consequential in Ukraine,&quot; Birol told the FT, adding that &quot;this is the most pressing energy security issue today in the world.&quot; According to Birol, the lack of energy resources will affect the work of hospitals, schools, and the water supply and have other &quot;major implications.&quot; Birol said there were &quot;major shortages&quot; of crucial parts, including transformers, grid equipment, and diesel generators. He added that Europe has been too &quot;conservative&quot; in providing Ukraine with additional electricity and could increase exports without jeopardizing European supplies. European consumers could help by cutting their electricity demand, allowing more power to flow to their eastern neighbor. It would be &quot;a very decent way to show solidarity,&quot; Birol said. The EU will support Ukraine with 160 million euros ($178 million) ahead of winter to improve the country&apos;s resilience to Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Sept. 19. Around 60 million euros ($67 million) of the EU aid will go toward humanitarian aid such as shelters and heaters. Roughly 100 million euros ($111 million) will be spent on repairing energy infrastructure and developing renewable energy. EU ambassadors agreed on May 8 to use the windfall profits from frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction and defense needs. Kyiv is expected to receive roughly 3 billion euros ($3.2 billion) every year, according to earlier discussions. Von der Leyen will meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Sept. 20 to discuss the energy situation and how to spend the EU&apos;s 100 million euros ($111 million) allocated to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-has-been-too-reticent-in-supporting-ukraine-ahead-of-winter-iea-chief-says/	2024-09-20T02:13:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/DSC01989.jpg
US Congress nears deal on extending $6 billion in Ukraine aid before expiration, Reuters reports	U.S. Congress and the Biden administration are close to an agreement on a one-year extension of $5.8 billion in military aid for Ukraine before it expires at the end of September, Reuters reported on Sept. 19, citing two undisclosed sources. The U.S. administration requested Congress to extend the remaining sum in the presidential drawdown authority (PDA), a key tool for supplying Ukraine with arms from Pentagon stocks, to prevent it from expiring by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Foreign military assistance is crucial for Kyiv as the all-out war with Russia stretches for two and half years, with Russian forces pushing hard in Ukraine&apos;s east. There is bipartisan support in Congress to extend the PDA in a Continuing Resolution, a short-term emergency bill that U.S. lawmakers must pass within the next 11 days to avoid a government shutdown, Reuters wrote. After the House of Representatives failed to pass a Republican-backed spending bill on Sept. 18 that did not include the PDA extension, the Democratic-led Senate said it would prepare a new bill to avert a shutdown. The sources told Reuters that the Senate bill should include the prolongation of the Ukraine aid funds. It remains unclear whether Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who delayed a $61 billion aid bill for Kyiv for months earlier this year, will support it. The $61 billion assistance package was eventually passed in April, allocating some $7.8 billion to the PDA and allowing the release of a number of defense aid tranches since then. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that while he is grateful for Congress&apos;s decision, the aid is nevertheless trickling down too slowly as Ukraine cannot equip even &quot;four out of the 14 brigades&quot; the country is mustering. This is evidenced by the fact that the majority of the $7.8 billion in PDA allocated for this fiscal year remains unused. A congressional aid told the Kyiv Independent that the delays are connected to domestic U.S. stock constraints and a &quot;constant flexibility issue with each withdrawal&quot; in a situation where the U.S. adapts to Ukraine&apos;s needs. Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry also said in a comment for the Kyiv Independent that there is a &quot;lack of the necessary weapons in the Pentagon&apos;s warehouses.&quot; Washington unveiled its latest aid package worth $250 million during a Ramstein group meeting on Sept. 6. It included anti-air missiles, artillery shells, Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, HIMARS missiles, and other assistance.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-congress-nears-deal-on-6-billion/	2024-09-20T01:56:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2157612510.jpg
Kyiv 2nd worst in world's air quality amid fires in region	Kyiv authorities warned about sharp and &quot;temporary deterioration&quot; of air quality in Kyiv on Sept. 20 due to the accumulation of harmful substances. The likely cause is fires in Kyiv Oblast that released large amounts of dust particles in the air, the environmental department of the Kyiv city military administration said. Authorities warned on Sept. 16 that the air quality in the capital may worsen due to fires in the Vyshhorod district of Kyiv Oblast. Large-scale fires were also recorded elsewhere in Ukraine recently amid dry weather and &#x2013; in some areas &#x2013; constant Russian attacks. The IQAir air quality index places Kyiv as the second most polluted city in the world as of 11 a.m., with only Cairo ranked higher. Earlier in the day, Kyiv was ranked the worst city in the world before a sudden deterioration of the pollution levels in Cario. Kyiv has a rating of 181 on the 0-500 scale, which is classified as &quot;unhealthy&quot; and calls for reduced outdoor exertion by residents of the affected area. The pollution level is currently 19.7 times the WHO annual air quality guideline value. The Kyiv city authorities called upon the residents to close windows, avoid staying outdoors, drink lots of water, and turn on air purifiers. The pollutants recorded in the air included nitrogen oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone. Kyiv has been ranked among the 30 cities with the cleanest air both in 2022 and 2023, positioned close to capitals like Madrid or Tokyo.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-air-pollution/	2024-09-20T01:06:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172302126.jpg
Germany has overcome shortage of Russian gas and is ready for winter, minister says	Germany has resolved the energy crisis and is ready for the coming winter of 2025, German Vice-Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habeck said in comments quoted by Bild on Sept. 19. &quot;There is no more gas shortage,&quot; Habeck said during a dialog with the citizens in the city of Osnabruck, adding that Germany no longer has a need for Russian gas. Russia began tightening screws on gas supplies to Europe in the wake of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and subsequent Western sanctions. Russia&apos;s state energy giant Gazprom suspended direct supplies through the Nord Stream pipeline from Russia to Germany in 2022. The following year, Germany signed an agreement with Norway, Europe&apos;s largest gas producer, increasing the share of Norwegian supplies to 60%, comparable to the amount Russia used to account for. Germany&apos;s natural gas storage facilities are full, and all goals have been met, according to Habeck. Yet the official said that gas prices in Germany are &quot;higher than before the war in Ukraine.&quot; &quot;Prices are higher; this also applies to gas, but not because we have a shortage,&quot; the minister said, adding that the real reason is that Asian nations are buying out liquefied natural gas (LNG) due to extreme heat in their countries. Habeck expressed confidence that gas prices will fall again when additional LNG volumes are released and enter the German market. Overall, gas prices in Germany will be only &quot;moderately higher than in the years before the pandemic,&quot; he claimed. Ukraine currently transits Russian gas to the EU as part of a deal signed in 2019, which is set to expire in December 2024. Europe and Ukraine are in talks with Azerbaijan about replacing Russia as a supplier. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said on Sept. 6 that negotiations are underway with the EU, Moscow, and Kyiv to transit Azeri gas after Ukraine stopped transiting Russian gas. Gas supplies from Azerbaijan would have to first transit through southern Russia before reaching Ukraine. &quot;Russia, Ukraine, and European institutions have approached us in connection with the continuation of gas transit through the territory of Ukraine,&quot; Aliyev said. &quot;For several months, we have been making great efforts to come to a common denominator.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-has-overcome-gas-shortage/	2024-09-20T00:32:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1230851711.jpeg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 5, injure 33 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least five people and injured at least 33 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Sept. 20. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 61 of the 70 Shahed-type drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Nine drones were &quot;lost&quot; in Ukraine as a result of &quot;active measures&quot; by Ukrainian forces. A Kh-59 cruise missile was also reportedly shot down overnight. In Sumy Oblast, one person was killed and 17 people injured over the past day, the regional military administration reported. Russia launched an airstrike against the city of Sumy late on Sept. 19, hitting a retirement home, killing one person, and injuring 14, officials said. Three other people were reportedly injured during an airstrike against the Seredyna-Buda community earlier the same day. In Donetsk Oblast, three people were killed and eight injured over the past day, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Two people were killed during an attack against Chasiv Yar, and one was killed in Kostiantynivka. Two injuries were reported in the village of Rivne, two in Kurakhivka, and one each in Kurakhove, Zoria, Zarichne, and Serebrianka, the governor said. Russian attacks against Kharkiv Oblast killed an 85-year-old man in the town of Vilcha near Vovchansk, injured a 65-year-old man in Kupiansk, and wounded two people in the village of Shestakove, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. Five people were injured during Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast over the past day, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. A critical infrastructure facility, five multi-story buildings, and 14 houses were damaged. Cherkasy, Dnipropetrovsk, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kyiv, Kirovohrad, Vinnytsia, Poltava, Khmelnytskyi, Odesa, Luhansk, Lviv, Mykolaiv, Rivne, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts also came under attack, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-93/	2024-09-20T00:21:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/Donets.jpg
Ukraine slaps new sanctions against individuals, entities from Iran, China, Russia	President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree on Sept. 19 imposing sanctions against six individuals and over 40 entities from Iran, China, and Russia. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine has been expanding the list of sanctions against people or entities over their support for Moscow&apos;s war. China, despite its declared neutrality in the war, is Russia&apos;s leading supplier of dual-use goods, while Iran regularly provides Russia with Shahed-type drones and, more recently, ballistic missiles. Ukraine introduced sanctions against six foreigners associated with the supply and purchase of drones to Russia, including the director of the Iranian company Pishgam Electronic Safeh Company (PESC), Hamid Reza Janghorbani, and the official representative of the Hong Kong company Hongkong Himark Electron Model Limited, Yang Fan (China). The sanctions list also included Russian citizens Alexander Fedorko, Igor Dyugurov, Valentina Grigorieva, Liliya Alimova, and their Russian businesses. Ukraine imposed restrictions against 40 legal entities from Russia, Iran, and China as well. The sanctions list included Saad Sazeh Faraz Sharif, director of the Iranian company Shakad Sanat Asmari, as well as the heads and deputies of the Aerospace Forces of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The recent sanctions also targeted the Russian ship lighting plant Mayak and the Kazan State Gunpowder Plant. The U.S. Treasury Department&apos;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) also announced updates to its sanctions list on Sept. 19, adding the names of five entities and one individual in violation of regulations the U.S. has placed on North Korea. North Korea and Russia have deepened their military and political cooperation since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In January, the U.S. announced sanctions on a Russian state-owned airline involved in the transfer of North Korean ballistic missiles to Russia. South Korea has warned that North Korea may be supplying Russia with tactical guided missiles and over six million artillery shells.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-introduces-new-sanctions/	2024-09-19T23:34:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/Zelensky-in-Italy.jpeg

Von der Leyen arrives in Kyiv to discuss Ukraine's energy needs with Zelensky	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen arrived in Kyiv on Sept. 20 to discuss Ukraine&apos;s energy needs ahead of the coming winter. &quot;My 8th visit to Kyiv comes as the heating season starts soon, and Russia keeps targeting energy infrastructure,&quot; von der Leyen said on X. &quot;We will help Ukraine in its brave efforts,&quot; the chief of the EU&apos;s executive arm said, adding she will discuss Europe&apos;s support &quot;from winter preparedness to defense, to accession and progress on the G7 loans.&quot; In his evening address on Sept. 19, Zelensky said he is expecting &quot;important talks&quot; with von der Leyen as Ukraine braces for what some warn might be the &quot;sternest&quot; winter of the war yet.	https://kyivindependent.com/von-der-leyen-arrives-in-kyiv/	2024-09-19T22:24:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/von-der-2.jpg
Guardian: Russia commanders warned of plans for Ukraine's Kursk incursion months in advance, seized documents show	Russian commanders anticipated that Ukraine was planning an incursion into Kursk Oblast months before it occurred, the Guardian reported on Sept. 20, citing a collection of documents that Ukrainian soldiers said they had seized from abandoned Russian positions. The documents included printed orders and handwritten entries from commanders. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in early August, claiming to have seized around 100 settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles). Russia appeared to have been taken by surprise by the attack, which allowed Ukrainian forces to quickly fan out across the border and move deep into Russian territory. According to the seized documents, the authenticity of which the Guardian said they &quot;could not independently verify,&quot; Russian commanders had been cautioning that a potential cross-border breakthrough could occur as far back as January 2024. While the earlier warnings were largely vague, they grew increasingly more detailed &#x2014; including specific threats that Ukraine would try to seize the town of Sudzha &#x2014; a warning that was realized after Ukraine captured it in August. The seized documents also revealed that Russian commanders had attempted to beef up security by the border in Kursk Oblast and &quot;organize additional exercises for the leadership of units and strongpoints regarding the proper organization of defenses&quot; ahead of a possible Ukrainian attack. Other revelations from the documents were statements from commanders about the deteriorating morale of Russian soldiers in the area. &quot;The analysis of the current situation regarding suicides shows that the issue of servicemen dying as a result of suicidal incidents remains tense,&quot; one entry read. Another entry detailed the specifics of one soldier&apos;s suicide. &quot;The investigation into the incident determined that the cause of the suicide and death was a nervous and psychological breakdown, caused by his prolonged state of depression due to his service in the Russian army,&quot; the entry read. Commanders also wrote instructions on how to improve morale, including one suggestion that soldiers should receive daily political lessons &quot;aimed at maintaining and raising the political, moral, and psychological condition of the personnel.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/guardian-russia-commanders-warned-of-plans-for-ukraines-kursk-incursion-months-in-advance-seized-documents-show/	2024-09-19T21:40:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166685743.jpg
Kremlin begins criminal investigation into chief editor of Russian independent media outlet Novaya Gazeta Europe	Russia&apos;s Investigative Committee has begun a criminal investigation into Kirill Martynov, the chief editor of the independent Russian media outlet Novaya Gazeta Europe, the state-run news organization TASS reported on Sept. 19, citing law enforcement officials. The Investigative Committee reportedly alleged that Martynov was &quot;conducting activities of an undesirable organization.&quot; Novaya Gazeta Europe is an offshoot of the Russian outlet Novaya Gazeta. It was formed in Latvia shortly after the beginning of the full-scale war and subsequent Russian crackdown on free speech. Novaya Gazeta had its media license stripped in Russia in September 2022. In June 2023, Russia&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office declared Novaya Gazeta Europe an &quot;undesirable&quot; organization. The law on &quot;undesirable&quot; organizations has existed since 2015 and has been used to target perceived opponents of Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s regime, including NGOs, independent media outlets, human rights groups, and others. The Russian government passed a law in May expanding the list of &quot;undesirable&quot; organizations to include those funded by foreign states. Following a subsequent court case brought by Russian organizations operating outside of the country, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that the expanded law violates the European Convention on Human Rights. &quot;Undesirable&quot; organizations are banned from operating in Russia, and it is illegal for individuals or other media outlets to share their content. Leaders of such organizations can face up to six years in prison, and members could receive prison sentences of up to four years.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-begins-criminal-investigation-into-chief-editor-of-russian-independent-media-outlet-novaya-gazeta-europe/	2024-09-19T20:16:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1243534938.jpg
EU considering ending Georgia's visa-free access over ruling party's democratic backsliding	The EU is weighing the potential end to Georgia&apos;s visa-free access to the bloc as a result of democratic backsliding under the ruling Georgian Dream party, Politico reported on Sept. 19, citing an unnamed spokesperson for the European Commission. &quot;All options are on the table&quot; if Georgia does not reverse its trend toward authoritarianism, &quot;including the potential temporary suspension of the visa liberalization scheme,&quot; the spokesperson told Politico. Concerns about Georgia&apos;s democracy have reached a fever pitch after the ruling Georgian Dream party passed the foreign agents law, which requires organizations that receive foreign funding to be labeled as &quot;foreign agents&quot; and mirrors repressive Russian legislation used to crack down on Kremlin regime critics. Georgia&apos;s traditional Western partners &#x2014; the EU and the U.S., have responded to the law&apos;s passage and related crackdown on protesters by halting aid, effectively freezing the country&apos;s EU bid, and sanctioning government officials. The proposed plan to end Georgia&apos;s visa-free access to the EU, first granted in 2017, was the latest step in the deteriorating relations between Georgia and the West. &quot;As part of the EU-Georgia visa liberalization dialogue and the corresponding Action Plan, Georgia was required to meet specific benchmarks, including ensuring the protection of fundamental rights and preventing discrimination,&quot; the European Commission spokesperson said. &quot;An assessment would of course take place in case of developments posing a risk to the internal security of the Schengen area, as well as in case of a further democratic decline in Georgia.&quot; Following rumors in recent days that the visa-free regime might be ended, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze characterized the proposal as a &quot;cheap blackmail attempt.&quot; Kobakhidze further claimed that &quot;it will not have an impact on the election,&quot; referring to the upcoming parliamentary elections scheduled for October. Georgian Dream, in power since 2012, is seeking a fourth term. The previous day, Georgia&apos;s parliament passed a package of anti-LGBTQ legislation that would ban gender transition, adoption by same-sex couples, and forbid gatherings or the distribution of information &quot;aimed at promoting&quot; LGBTQ relationships. The legislation was widely condemned by Georgia&apos;s Western allies, who reiterated concerns that the government&apos;s trajectory is hurting the country&apos;s Euro-Atlantic goals. A day after the parliament passed the set of bills, Kesaria Abramidze, one of Georgia&apos;s most prominent transgender public figures, was murdered. Police have arrested her boyfriend, who is suspected in Abramidze&apos;s killing. In response to the murder, the human rights NGO Social Justice Center said, &quot;There is a direct correlation between the use of hate speech in politics and hate crimes.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-considering-ending-georgias-visa-free-access-over-ruling-partys-democratic-backsliding/	2024-09-19T17:43:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2151494694.jpg
Bulgarian far-right party’s foreign agent bill fails in committee vote	The Bulgarian Parliament&apos;s Committee on Culture and Media voted down a bill on Sept. 19 proposed by its chairperson belonging to the Vuzrazhdane (Revival) Party to create a registry of &quot;foreign agents.&quot;Founded in 2014 and described by some as pro-Russian, Revival came in third in Bulgaria&apos;s snap parliamentary election in June, gaining 41 seats in the 240-seat parliament. Revival has supported maintaining Bulgaria&apos;s &quot;deep ties&quot; with Russia.Despite Revival&apos;s claims that its proposed foreign agent law is similar to U.S. law, in both Bulgaria and Russia, individuals working as &quot;foreign agents&quot; would be barred from working in educational institutions and certain ministries and &quot;must mark&#x2026;any material (they) create with a large inscription on the title page &#x2014; foreign agent. Just like in Russia,&quot; public broadcaster Bulgarian National Television (BNT) said. A similar foreign agents law was signed into law in Georgia by the ruling Georgian Dream party in June and has been criticized for enabling authorities to monitor NGOs and media outlets that receive more than 20% of their income from abroad. Washington and Brussels have denounced the bill as incompatible with Western values, and the European Council froze Georgia&apos;s EU accession process in response to its passage. Revival had recently had success in passing anti-LGTBQ legislation, mirroring the passage of anti-LGBTQ legislation by Georgian Dream and similar moves in Russia.Initially a hesitant partner, Bulgaria has become increasingly supportive of Kyiv as the war has progressed. Bulgaria has provided Ukraine with a variety of aid since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, but pro-Russian sentiment has remained strong in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/bulgarian-far-right-partys-foreign-agent-bill-fails-in-committee-vote/	2024-09-19T17:32:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2123616394.jpg
Delivering more weapons to Ukraine will help ‘end the war’ sooner, Stoltenberg says	During a speech at a German Marshall Fund event on Sept. 19, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg reiterated his support for further providing Western-made weaponry to Ukraine, noting that additional deliveries will continue to help Ukraine push back against Russian aggression on the battlefield. &quot;The paradox is that the more weapons for Ukraine we are able to deliver, the more likely it is that we can reach a peace and end to the war,&quot; Stoltenberg said. &quot;The more credible our long-term military support, the sooner the war will end.&quot; Stoltenberg&apos;s comments come amid intensified rhetoric and saber-rattling from Russian President Vladimir Putin and various Russian officials. Russia has repeatedly attempted to draw &quot;red lines&quot; in recent months as Western countries contemplate allowing Ukraine to use Western long-range missiles to strike deep within Russian territory. While many NATO allies have responded by reassuring Ukraine of its support with the delivery of weapons, other political leaders have opposed additional weapons deliveries, and have instead called for negotiations with Moscow. During his speech on Sept. 19, Stoltenberg rebuffed the notion of sustained peace without adequate support for Ukraine, stating that &quot;any future deal must be backed by strong military support to Ukraine.&quot; &quot;We all want this war to end. The quickest way to end the war is to lose it. But that will not bring peace. It will bring Russian occupation.&quot; Stoltenberg&apos;s comments on additional weapons deliveries come just days after the outgoing NATO chief said that the bloc could have provided Ukraine with more arms to prevent Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine &quot;Now we provide military stuff to a war &#x2014; then we could have provided military stuff to prevent the war,&quot; Stoltenberg told the German newspaper FAS on Sept. 14. Stoltenberg has consistently urged NATO allies to increase defense spending amid risks of fracturing among the alliance. During the recent NATO summit in Washington, the alliance clarified Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible&quot; path toward NATO by emphasizing the alliance&apos;s ongoing commitments to Kyiv &quot;constitute a bridge to Ukraine&apos;s membership.&quot; On Sept. 19, Stoltenberg doubled down on his past statement on, adding that there can be &quot;no lasting security for Ukraine, without NATO membership.&quot; &quot;NATO&#x2019;s door is open. Ukraine will join,&quot; Stoltenberg concluded.	https://kyivindependent.com/providing-ukraine-with-more-weaponry-will-make-it-more-likely-to-end-war-stoltenberg-says/	2024-09-19T16:44:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1518191919.jpg
Germany plans additional $445 million in aid for Ukraine in 2024, AFP reports	Despite reporting in August by the German media outlet Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) that Berlin was not planning to approve additional aid to Kyiv this year, a German Finance Ministry document showed an additional 400 million euros ($445 million) in additional support earmarked for Ukraine, AFP reported on Sept. 19, citing the document in question.According to the document &#x2014; a letter to the parliamentary budget committee &#x2014; additional funds are needed to &quot;fulfill the German government&apos;s support commitments to the Ukrainian armed forces.&quot; The funds are required to provide military support, such as drones and air defense equipment &quot;without delay,&quot; to bolster Ukraine on the battlefield for the remainder of 2024.Reuters reported in May, citing an unnamed source, that Berlin planned to up its military aid to Ukraine by another 3.8 billion euros ($4.13 billion) in 2024. However, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius&apos; request was not approved by the Finance Ministry, according to FAZ.Initially a hesitant partner, Germany has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. Berlin will provide Kyiv with around 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion) this year, but the aid will be reportedly cut by half &#x2014; to 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) &#x2014; in 2025. Berlin had been hoping that the shortfall in assistance would be made up by Ukraine receiving $50 billion in profits from frozen Russian assets. However, Hungary has caused delays in the U.S.&apos;s procedural involvement in the assets scheme. &#xA0;In addition to budgetary concerns, &quot;anti-war&quot; parties that oppose aid to Ukraine on the right and left made gains in regional elections on Sept. 1, causing political complications for Germany&apos;s commitment to support Ukraine.According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW), as of June 2024, Germany has allocated 14.7 billion euros ($16.4 billion) in support for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-plans-additional-445-million-in-aid-for-ukraine-in-2024-afp-reports/	2024-09-19T15:52:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-200515448-001.jpg
Trump's campaign appearance with Polish President Duda canceled, sources tell Reuters	Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has canceled his previously planned campaign appearance with Polish President Andrzej Duda, Reuters reported on Sept. 19, citing sources familiar with Trump&apos;s campaign schedule. The previous day, anonymous sources told Reuters that Trump planned a joint appearance with Duda at a monument at a Polish-American Roman Catholic shrine near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The reasons for the cancelation were not specified. It is unknown if Trump and Duda plan to meet elsewhere on the campaign trail. Foreign leaders, including President Volodymyr Zelensky and Duda, are convening in New York City over the next few days for the 79th General Assembly of the U.N. &quot;Probably, yes,&quot; Trump answered when asked by a reporter if he plans to meet Zelensky during his visit to the U.S. He did not provide additional details on any planned meeting. Pennsylvania is a battleground state in the U.S. presidential election and boasts a large Polish-American population. Vice President Kamala Harris leveraged the Polish-American community in a critique of Trump during the Sept. 10 debate, also held in Pennsylvania. &quot;Why don&apos;t you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch,&quot; she said.

US sanctions Russian individuals, entities engaging in prohibited transactions with North Korea	The U.S. Treasury Department&apos;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced updates to its sanctions list on Sept. 19, adding the names of five entities and one individual in violation of regulations the U.S. has placed on North Korea.&quot;Today&apos;s action holds accountable parties that have assisted (North Korea) and Russian sanctions evasion,&quot; said Treasury official Bradley Smith. &quot;The U.S. remains strongly committed to leveraging all our available tools to disrupt this and other schemes intended to support Russia&apos;s war of aggression against Ukraine and enable (North Korea&apos;s) illicit access to the international financial system.&quot;North Korea and Russia have deepened their military and political cooperation since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.&quot;North Korea would be first, then there is no one for a long time, and then everyone else,&quot; Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, said earlier in September, discussing countries that offer the most military support to Russia.In January, the U.S. announced sanctions on a Russian state-owned airline involved in the transfer of North Korean ballistic missiles to Russia. South Korea has warned that North Korea may be supplying Russia with tactical guided missiles and over six million artillery shells. MRB Bank, the &quot;International Settlement Bank&quot; LLC, one of the entities updated as violating sanctions on North Korea, has been providing banking services in Russian-occupied territories under the control of Russia&apos;s Central Bank since 2014.One of the involved sanctioned North Korean entities has been designated as serving as North Korea&apos;s primary foreign currency exchange bank and &quot;is vital to the illicit financial networks (North Korea) uses to finance its WMD and ballistic missile programs,&quot; the Treasury said.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-sanctions-russian-individuals-entities-engaging-in-prohibited-transactions-with-north-korea/	2024-09-19T14:14:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2157653203.jpg
US Ambassador Brink: ‘We have some sense of contours of Zelensky’s victory plan’	The Kyiv Independent spoke with the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink on Sept. 19 on the sidelines of the National Media Talk, an annual journalism conference held in Kyiv, and supported by USAID and Internews. The following is the transcript of the interview: The Kyiv Independent: Thank you for doing this, and for supporting this event &#x2013; that&#x2019;s important for the journalistic community. Something that we are watching very closely now is President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s upcoming visit to Washington next week. What are your expectations for the visit? Ambassador Brink: I was so delighted today to talk to media, government, and civil society representatives at a very important media event in Kyiv, even in wartime circumstances. Free media, independent media is very important to Ukraine&apos;s aspirations to join Europe, to join NATO. It&apos;s a delight to be here. With regard to President Zelensky&apos;s visit to the United States. I know my president is very much looking forward to hosting him in the United States. I know he will have other meetings as well. We&apos;re looking forward to hearing his views on the future. He has said very clearly that he&apos;s going to present those to President Biden. President Biden and his team will be glad to do this meeting with President Zelensky and follow up. The Kyiv Independent: We know that President Zelensky is going to present his victory plan, which is now fully complete, as of yesterday. Have you had a chance to take a look at it? What do you expect from it? &#xA0; Ambassador Brink: President Zelensky has been very clear that he is going to show this plan first to President Biden. He and his team have been true to that. We have some sense of the contours of this plan, and of course, we&apos;re working hand in glove with the government to support your victory in many different ways. It&apos;ll be very positive for us to receive the details of the victory plan and be able to work together to follow up on this. The Kyiv Independent: Is the U.S. still ready to support Ukraine&apos;s full victory, meaning the return of all territories, including Crimea, and the full military defeat of Russia? Ambassador Brink: Look, our position has been very clear as articulated by the president, as articulated by Secretary Blinken when he was just here last week in Kyiv. We support Ukraine and its victory in its win against Russia&apos;s aggression. Now our support is in support of a vision of Ukraine &#x2013; sovereign, independent, democratic, prosperous, integrated into Europe and into NATO. So that vision is a vision from Ukrainians, and it&apos;s a vision of the future that we support. That&apos;s our position. We&apos;re leaving the details of the war, the details of when and how to negotiate up to your democratically elected president. The Kyiv Independent: Should we be hopeful about a change in the U.S. policy on allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles on Russian territory? Ambassador Brink: I&apos;m not going to get ahead of where my president and administration are. We have heard the request. I can tell you we will continue to support Ukrainians in your effort to fight against Russia&apos;s aggression. We will continue to adjust and adapt how we are supporting you, and we will work really closely and are working very closely with your government and administration in order to achieve that goal. The Kyiv Independent: What can you say to Ukrainians and supporters of Ukraine from around the world who are watching anxiously what&apos;s going to happen with the U.S. presidential election and how it will impact the war and the future of Ukraine? Ambassador Brink: Well, in my position as the president&apos;s representative in Kyiv, I cannot comment on our politics. What I can say is this: I spend a lot of time in America, in many parts of America, on the East Coast, on the West Coast. I&apos;m from the Midwest. There is strong bipartisan support for Ukraine, for your fight for freedom, for the values that we share together, and for the future that you envision for yourself. This is important for your country, but it&apos;s also important for European security and U.S. vital national interests. That&apos;s my view. That&apos;s the view of foreign policy experts across the political spectrum. That&apos;s the administration&apos;s view. And so that well of support is very important to have and one which we are going to use to keep supporting your effort to fight Russia&apos;s aggression. The Kyiv Independent: We&apos;re talking today at the National Media Talk, an event focusing on media in wartime. As you very well know, at the beginning of the year, Ukrainian journalists raised concerns about certain attempts at intimidation, surveillance, and so on. What is your message to those actors in Ukraine who are willing to try to suppress free media during wartime and who see independent journalism as a threat? Ambassador Brink: Our position is very clear on free media. It is vital, it&apos;s critical. Efforts of harassment and intimidation &#x2013; wherever they come from &#x2013; against independent and free media don&apos;t have a place in a country that&apos;s trying to move into the EU or NATO. The Kyiv Independent: There&apos;s been a government reshuffle recently that has attracted a lot of interest. Is there anything that the embassy is watching especially closely within the reshuffle? The civil society has been raising concerns a lot lately about the consolidation of power in the energy sector, specifically with Minister Herman Halushchenko and with the firing of the chief of Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi. Is this an area that you&apos;re watching? Do you have any comments on that? Ambassador Brink: The members of the government &#x2013; that is up to the democratically elected leader of your country, President Zelensky. With regard to your energy situation, that is something that we also strongly support in terms of your ability to defend yourself against Russian missiles and drones, but also to repair and protect the energy infrastructure. We are going to continue in that regard to do everything possible to support your preparations for this winter. We have spent $324 million this spring to put about three gigawatts back into your grid. We have another $825 million that we are spending to do many aspects of repair, protection, and assistance to distribution. So we&apos;re going to continue in that way. What I would say about this is that strong corporate governance that is done according to OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) standards is vital for donor confidence and private sector investment, which is what Ukraine needs for its recovery. The Kyiv Independent: Just to clarify, do you mean that the firing of Kudrytskyi was potentially a threat to proper corporate governance? Ambassador Brink: I don&apos;t want to comment on the specifics of how it happened, but I can say that a strong adherence to international standards &#x2014; that means OECD standards in corporate governance in SOEs (state-owned enterprises), especially SOEs like Ukrenergo and other energy SOEs &#x2014; is vitally important to your future.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-ambassador-brink-we-have-some-sense-of-contours-of-zelenskys-victory-plan/	2024-09-19T12:38:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2152422190.jpg
Georgian leader's 'apology' for 2008 war could be a win for Russia, experts say	The de facto leader of the ruling Georgian Dream party stunned Georgians &#x2014; who are rarely shocked by the turbulent political situation in the country &#x2014; by declaring that Georgia should &quot;apologize&quot; for Russia&apos;s 2008 war against the country. Oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili&apos;s statement on Sept. 14 was a campaign promise made ahead of the upcoming October parliamentary election, and part of his party&apos;s larger trend of rapprochement with Russia. But according to analysts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent, the suggestion that Georgia, rather than Russia, is at fault for the war may be a step too far and is unlikely to have a positive electoral impact for the Georgian Dream. &quot;This statement is not going to make the Georgian Dream any more popular with its constituents, those who already like them will vote for them no matter what, and those who are undecided, I think they will, for lack of a better term, be turned off by this statement,&quot; said Tinatin Japaridze, a risk analyst at the Eurasia Group. &quot;It&apos;s a lose-lose for Tbilisi, but a definite gain for Moscow because it is able to distance itself from taking responsibility for (the 2008 war),&quot; Japaridze told the Kyiv Independent. The five-day war in 2008, which resulted in hundreds of deaths, the displacement of almost 130,000 people, and cemented the Russian occupation of around 20% of the country, has long been a hot-button political issue for Georgia. While Ivanishvili&apos;s suggestion that Georgia should apologize to Ossetians, the minority ethnic group that predominantly lives in the South Ossetia region occupied by Russia, was the strongest statement to date, it was not the first time that Ivanishvili or other officials have blamed their own country for the Russian invasion of sovereign Georgian territory. The roots of the 2008 Russian invasion of Georgia stretch back to Soviet times when an autonomous region for Ossetians was created after the Red Army took over Georgia in the 1920s and established communist rule. Across the border, in then Soviet Russia lay the North Ossetia autonomous region, where the bulk of ethnic Ossetians lived. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the independence of Georgia, the majority of Ossetians were spread across the Russian North Ossetia, and the Georgian South Ossetia, now across an international border. An ethnic conflict, inflamed and supported by Moscow, soon arose, resulting after the war&apos;s end in 1992 with divided control between Tbilisi and South Ossetian separatists in the region. An unclear situation in South Ossetia remained in place until 2008 by which point Russia had given passports to a majority of the population. Relations between the strongly pro-Western Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili (2004-2013) and Russia had deteriorated. Moscow began further fanning the flames of separatism and claiming that Georgia was planning a genocide of Ossetians. Militant groups in South Ossetia began firing on Georgian positions, and ultimately, Saakashvili decided to send troops into the breakaway region.

(Dimitar Dilkoff / AFP via Getty Images)In response, under the guise of protecting Ossetians, Russia sent its own military into the area, resulting in the five-day war and the subsequent Russian occupation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, another region of Georgia where Russian-backed separatists had fought a war with Tbilisi in the 1990s. During the war, Russian troops went far past the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia &#x2014; both internationally recognized as sovereign Georgian territory &#x2014; and drove armored columns just dozens of miles from Tbilisi. According to the Georgian Foreign Ministry, 224 Georgian civilians and 161 soldiers were killed during the war. The war has been hotly debated across Georgia, Russia, and the West. Countless explanations have been given for how it started, who set it off, and who should be blamed. A report by the Council of the European Union issued in 2009 claimed that Georgia was responsible for the war because it had set off hostilities through its shelling of the South Ossetian capital, Tskhinvali. The report said the Georgian attack was &quot;unjustifiable&quot; but also acknowledged that Russia went far beyond defending its own servicemen and Ossetian citizens and that the incursion past South Ossetia was &quot;in violation of international law.&quot; The report was criticized at the time for being overly deferential to Russia, a charge that has only increased since. The European Council on Foreign Relations said in 2015 that the report had been influenced by Russian propaganda, and other think tanks like the Atlantic Council said that Russia was unequivocally to blame. The European Court on Human Rights ruled in 2021 that Russia was responsible for a wide variety of human rights violations in the war. The war has continued to be rethought and analyzed after Russia&apos;s military aggression against Ukraine, with many leaders and experts saying the international community&apos;s lack of proper response then gave the green light for Russia to later invade Ukraine. But within Georgia, the war has become a political weapon, often employed by the Georgian Dream to smear Saakashvili &#x2013; imprisoned since 2021 on charges he claims are trumped up by rivals &#x2013; and his party, the United National Movement (UNM).

(Andrei Smirnov / AFP via Getty Images)Ivanishvili and other officials have called Saakashvili and UNM &quot;criminal&quot; for starting the war, and have warned that their return to power (or any opposition party) would lead to renewed conflict with Russia. &quot;If one believes, like I do, that Ivanishvili has always been the Kremlin&apos;s instrument, with a task to bring Georgia back into Russian domination, then his current behavior can only be seen as the last steps of this plan,&quot; said David Zedelashvili, a constitutional lawyer and professor in Georgia. In his statement about the need to apologize to Ossetians, Ivanishvili said: &quot;Immediately after the Oct. 26 elections, those who instigated the war will face justice.&quot; Tina Bokuchava, chair of UNM, said the remarks were &quot;one of the most shameful, disgusting, treacherous statements,&quot; a sentiment that was echoed by other opposition politicians. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said in August that the Georgian Dream would seek a constitutional ban of UNM and its affiliates if it secured a constitutional majority in the election. Many viewed the pledge as a plan to ban all opposition parties. The wrangling over history is the latest step in Georgia&apos;s heated political environment as the country prepares for a decisive election in October. In the meantime, Georgia&apos;s relations with the West have fallen to a low point, particularly over concerns about the controversial foreign agents law passed earlier in the year. The EU has frozen Georgia&apos;s path toward accession to the bloc, and both the EU and the U.S. have halted aid packages, citing fears of democratic backsliding in the country. Some in Georgia believe that Ivanishvili&apos;s statement, given the wider context of warming relations with Moscow, is setting the stage for a possible deal with Russia that could see the reintegration of South Ossetia and Abkhazia into Georgia in the form of a confederation.

( Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images)While Georgians across the board would be thrilled to see the return of the occupied territories, there is a widespread belief that such a plan as currently formulated would be a poison pill that ensures their reintegration on the Kremlin&apos;s terms. &quot;I think there&apos;s a lot of skepticism that Georgia can get the territories back anytime soon, whether it&apos;s under the opposition that may come to power or under the current ruling party,&quot; said Japaridze. &quot;It&apos;s a pie in the sky that the Georgian Dream is going to try to use.&quot; The kind of concessions required to achieve reintegration with the consent of the Kremlin are unknown, and there are signs that Russian-backed authorities in South Ossetia and Abkhazia are not interested in such a deal. &quot;I don&apos;t think that Russia will even allow the project of confederation,&quot; Zedalishvili told the Kyiv Independent. South Ossetian officials said the apology should be viewed in the context of domestic electoral politics, and added that &quot;Tskhinvali expects not only verbal declarations but also practical steps&quot; on key issues to move forward with any rapprochement. The United National Movement (UNM) and Saakashvili are somewhat controversial in Georgia, opinion polls have found that a higher percentage of respondents said human rights abuses were the largest failure of the Saakashvili regime (27%). Failure to prevent the war came in second place, at 25%. At the same time, a slight majority (55%) disagreed that the government did everything possible to stop the war from happening.

(Natalia Kolesnikova / AFP via Getty Images)Numerous surveys have found that an overwhelming majority of Georgians still believe that Russia is the primary threat facing the country. Only 3% of respondents said they wanted a pro-Russia government, according to a 2023 poll. At the same time, a plurality of respondents, including those who support opposition parties, said that Georgia&apos;s foreign policy should be &quot;pro-Western, however we should maintain good relations with Russia.&quot; The Kremlin certainly wants to maintain influence over Georgia, but it does not hold political developments there to the same level of importance as in Ukraine, Japaridze said. &quot;As long as (the Kremlin&apos;s) interests are not being challenged, and ideally, they are being represented by whoever is in the Georgian government as the ruling party, Moscow is okay,&quot; Japaridze said. &quot;I don&apos;t think that they are going to necessarily try to invade Georgia or try to annex Georgia. &quot;I don&apos;t think they need to do that, as long as it&apos;s within (the Kremlin&apos;s) fold,&quot; she added.	https://kyivindependent.com/shameful-georgia-leaders-apology-for-2008-war-could-be-a-win-for-russia-experts-say/	2024-09-19T12:21:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-543778136.jpg
Bulgaria to ask EU to suspend egg imports from Ukraine	Bulgaria will request the suspension of egg imports from Ukraine at a meeting of the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on Sept. 23, Bulgarian Agriculture Minister Georgi Takhov said on Sept. 19. The statement comes as a sign of persisting disputes between Ukraine and eastern EU members over agricultural trade. The quarrels boiled over into border blockades on the Ukrainian-Polish border in late 2023 and early 2024, import bans on Ukrainian commodities like corn and wheat, and farmers&apos; protests in Poland, Bulgaria, and elsewhere. According to Takhov, Bulgarian producers are facing difficulties due to the growth of imports, which, in their opinion, hinders competition in the domestic market, Bulgarian 24 Chasa news outlet reported. The Bulgarian minister did not rule out the introduction of &quot;protective measures&quot; to limit trade with Ukraine. &quot;When the import of a certain type of product or commodity &#x2014; vegetables, meat, eggs &#x2014; reaches certain limits that the European Commission has outlined in advance, then we can activate the mechanism of banning their import. We are currently doing this in terms of eggs,&quot; Takhov said. The updated rules of duty-free and quota-free trade in agricultural products between Ukraine and the EU came into force on June 6. The new free-trade scheme incorporates an automatic safeguard mechanism designed to protect specific domestic sectors deemed &apos;sensitive&apos;&#x2014;including eggs, poultry, sugar, oats, maize, hulled grains, and honey&#x2014;from a surge in imports due to the lifting of quotas and tariffs. This allows the European Commission to activate the so-called emergency brake and reintroduce tariff-rate quotas if imports of these commodities surpass the average quantities imported between July 1, 2021, and Dec. 31, 2023. Ukrainian agricultural imports into the EU surged in 2022 after the outbreak of the full-scale war. The European bloc lifted tariffs on Ukrainian goods after the invasion&apos;s start to alleviate the country&apos;s economy amid Russian attacks and the blockade of the Black Sea trade routes.	https://kyivindependent.com/bulgaria-to-ask-eu-to-suspend-eggs-imports-from-ukraine/	2024-09-19T12:06:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1239485218.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russian airstrike on Sumy retirement home kills 1, injures 14	Key developments on Sept. 19: Russian forces attacked a retirement home in the city of Sumy with a guided aerial bomb on Sept. 19, killing one person and injuring at least 14 others, regional officials said. A total of 221 elderly people lived in the retirement home, according to Kalchenko. The attack partially destroyed two floors of the building, the Interior Ministry said. There are no people trapped under the rubble. A total of 147 people have been evacuated.

(Eugene Abrasimov/Suspilne Ukraine via Getty Images)&quot;People are being moved to new prepared places. They need medical and psychological assistance,&quot; Governor Volodymyr Artiukh said on national television. &quot;It (the attack) happened in the afternoon. People were having lunch or resting and were shocked.&quot; Russia has intensified its attacks on bordering Sumy Oblast, which the military considers to be a response to Kyiv&apos;s success in the Kursk operation that was launched in early August. Ukrainian authorities are planning to evacuate a total of 45,000 residents from the region. Moscow has moved about 40,000 Russian soldiers to embattled Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Sept. 19. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in early August, claiming to have seized around 100 settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles). Zelensky&apos;s latest figure of Russian soldiers redeployed to Kursk Oblast is lower than the one announced in early September, where he put their number at 60,000. &quot;We have also replenished our exchange fund,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;All of this is important and affects the general situation in the war.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s president said that Ukrainian soldiers managed to scale down Russia&apos;s &quot;assault potential&quot; in Donetsk Oblast, but described the situation as &quot;extremely difficult.&quot; Fierce fighting is ongoing in the Pokrovsk and Kurakhove sectors. The European Parliament passed a resolution on Sept. 19 calling for EU member states to lift restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of Western-supplied weapons inside Russia and accelerate weapons deliveries, &quot;including Taurus missiles.&quot; While Kyiv has received long-range missiles from partners like the U.S., the U.K., and France, Ukrainian forces are restricted from using the weapons to hit deep inside Russian territory. Germany has held back entirely on delivering long-range Taurus missiles, with Chancellor Olaf Scholz repeatedly citing a fear of escalation. &quot;Without lifting current restrictions, Ukraine cannot fully exercise its right to self-defense and remains exposed to attacks on its population and infrastructure,&quot; the European Parliament&apos;s resolution said. The text also called for member states &quot;to accelerate the delivery of weapons, air defense systems, and ammunition, including Taurus missiles.&quot; The resolution additionally called for EU states to &quot;maintain and extend the Council&#x2019;s sanctions policy against Russia, Belarus, and non-EU countries and entities providing Russia with military and dual-use technologies.&quot; The motion was passed with 425 votes in favor, 131 against, and 63 abstentions. Russia is placing explosives at dams in its own Belgorod Oblast, possibly to stage provocations and accuse Ukraine of causing environmental damage, a spokesperson of Ukraine&apos;s Kharkiv group of forces said on Sept. 19. Belgorod, lying only some 25 kilometers from the Ukrainian border, is one of the Russian cities most directly impacted by Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine. The city has come under numerous strikes, and ground clashes have taken place in Belgorod Oblast, most recently as part of Ukraine&apos;s cross-border incursions ongoing since early August. Military spokesperson Vitalii Sarantsev said that Russia is not only fortifying the Belgorod area but also mining dams, a move that can serve various purposes in the future. &quot;If the situation changes dramatically, Russia may blow up the dams to slow the advance of Ukrainian forces,&quot; Sarantsev suggested. &quot;We can also assume that Russia is preparing provocations at the dams to blame Ukraine for environmental and humanitarian consequences.&quot; This can be used to mobilize the population and divert attention from internal problems, he added. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Sarantsev did not mention any specific dams in the statement quoted by the Kharkiv group of forces. In Belgorod Oblast, there are 1,100 ponds and four artificial water reservoirs, including the Belgorod reservoir south of the city, covering an area of over 2,500 square kilometers (960 square miles). Berlin has handed over 22 Leopard 1 A5 tanks, 61,000 155 mm rounds of ammunition, three Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns with spare parts, and other equipment in its latest delivery of military aid to Ukraine, the German government said on Sept. 19. The tranche also included five Bandvagn 206 all-terrain vehicles, two air surveillance TRML-4D radars, and an all-terrain tracked carrier Warthog, as well as 112 vehicles from Bundeswehr and industry stocks. Ukraine received 30 Vector drones, 20 Heidrun RQ-35 reconnaissance drones, 12 Songbird drones, six Hornet XR drones, and 20 naval drones. Berlin further delivered three Beaver bridge-laying tanks with spare parts, a Dachs armored engineer vehicle with spare parts, and six Wisent 1 mine-clearing tanks. The 22 Leopard 1 A5 tanks with spare parts were delivered under a joint initiative with Denmark.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-30/	2024-09-19T11:46:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173160847.jpg

Last week, Russia launched a counterattack in Kursk Oblast, which was halted on Sept. 18, according to the Ukrainian military. One of the objectives of Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Kursk Oblast was to force Russia to redeploy its forces from the front in Ukraine, primarily from the Pokrovsk sector. In addition to pushing Russian troops away from the border, Ukraine has reportedly taken over 600 Russian captives and inflicted 6,000 casualties in Russia&apos;s region as of early September.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-redeploys-40-000-troops-to-kursk-oblast-amid-ongoing-kyivs-incursion-zelensky-says/	2024-09-19T11:06:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172545405.jpg
Zelensky to meet Biden, Harris in White House on Sept. 26	President Volodymyr Zelensky will visit the White House on Sept. 26 to discuss Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine with U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. &quot;The leaders will discuss the state of the war between Russia and Ukraine, including Ukraine&#x2019;s strategic planning and U.S. support for Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression,&quot; White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. Zelensky is heading to the U.S. to attend the 79th U.N. General Assembly in New York and present a five-point victory plan to the American leadership. U.S. officials said they had been acquainted with elements of Zelensky&apos;s strategy and voiced belief &quot;that (it) can work.&quot; Biden, who sat in the White House throughout the full-scale war and played a key role in building the pro-Kyiv coalition, will leave office next January. While positioning Washington as Ukraine&apos;s leading military donor, the Biden administration has attracted criticism over its careful and piecemeal approach to providing aid. Kyiv has increasingly criticized its partners in recent weeks, saying that despite the $61 billion U.S. aid bill being passed in April, the assistance is trickling down too slowly and is not enough to equip even &quot;four out of the 14 brigades&quot; the country is mustering. Ukraine is also still expecting a decision on long-range strikes in Russia with Western arms, something that Washington has been reluctant to approve. Early next year, Biden will pass over the keys from the White House either to Democratic candidate Harris or her Republican challenger, Donald Trump. Former President Trump said he would &quot;probably&quot; meet with Zelensky next week, as the Ukrainian leader said he wants to present the victory plan to him as well. Trump&apos;s possible return to the White House is causing concern in Ukraine. The pro-Trump wing of the Republican Party blocked the U.S. aid bill in Congress for months earlier this year, which proved detrimental to the situation on the Ukrainian battlefields and contributed to the loss of a key city of Avdiivka. Statements and rumors coming from Trump&apos;s inner circle also suggest he might seek to pressure Ukraine to cede territory or give up its NATO aspirations to achieve a quicker resolution of the war. The ex-president has repeatedly said he would end the war within &quot;24 hours if reelected&quot; and evaded a question about whether he wants Ukraine to win during a recent debate with Harris.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-meet-biden-harris-in-white-house-on-sept-26/	2024-09-19T11:01:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2161010459.jpg
EU aims to cover 25% of Ukraine's energy needs in winter, von der Leyen says ahead of Kyiv visit	European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will visit Kyiv on Sept. 20 to discuss Ukraine&apos;s energy needs with President Volodymyr Zelensky, she said on Sept. 19. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels alongside International Energy Agency director Fatih Birol, von der Leyen said Russia &quot;is trying to plunge the country into dark&quot; as it destroyed 80% of Ukraine&apos;s thermal power plants and one-third of its hydroelectric capacity. Zelensky said in his evening address on Sept. 19 that he is expecting &quot;important talks&quot; with von der Leyen in Kyiv regarding the energy situation. Moscow has pounded Ukrainian energy infrastructure in numerous aerial strikes throughout the full-scale war, with the largest one being carried out on Aug. 26 with the use of over 230 missiles and drones. &quot;As Ukraine&apos;s friends and partners, we must do all we can to keep the lights on,&quot; von der Leyen said. The EU executive arm&apos;s chief noted that Ukraine needs 17 gigawatts of power capacity for this winter and named three main vectors of the EU&apos;s energy assistance for the war-torn country. These steps should cover around 4.5 gigawatts of capacity, which is roughly 25% of Ukraine&apos;s winter needs, von der Leyen said. In the first step, the EU will assist Ukraine with repairing its energy infrastructure with the aim of restoring 2.5 gigawatts of capacity. &quot;As we speak, there is a full thermal power plant that is being dismantled in Lithuania and shipped piece by piece to Ukraine with our support,&quot; the EU official said. The EU will also continue exporting electricity to Ukraine and improving energy connectivity. The bloc will supply 2 gigawatts of electricity this way, which is equivalent to the loss of power from the occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, according to von der Leyen. As the third point, the EU will boost decentralized and renewable production to stabilize the electricity flow in the country. The EU will support Ukraine with 160 million euros ($178 million) ahead of winter to improve the country&apos;s resilience to Russian strikes, von der Leyen announced earlier today. Around 60 million euros ($67 million) of the EU aid will go toward humanitarian aid such as shelters and heaters. 100 million euros ($111 million) will be spent on repairing energy infrastructure and developing renewable energy. Speaking alongside von der Leyen, IEA chief Birol presented a 10-step action plan to help the country tackle the winter, which he said may be the &quot;sternest one yet.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/von-der-leyen-to-visit-kyiv/	2024-09-19T10:21:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1662120631.jpeg
Russia mining dams in Belgorod Oblast, Ukraine's military claims	Russia is placing explosives at dams in its own Belgorod Oblast, possibly to stage provocations and accuse Ukraine of causing environmental damage, a spokesperson of Ukraine&apos;s Kharkiv group of forces said on Sept. 19. Belgorod, lying only some 25 kilometers from the Ukrainian border, is one of the Russian cities most directly impacted by Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine. The city has come under numerous strikes, and ground clashes have taken place in Belgorod Oblast, most recently as part of Ukraine&apos;s cross-border incursions ongoing since early August. Military spokesperson Vitalii Sarantsev said that Russia is not only fortifying the Belgorod area but also mining dams, a move that can serve various purposes in the future. &quot;If the situation changes dramatically, Russia may blow up the dams to slow the advance of Ukrainian forces,&quot; Sarantsev suggested. &quot;We can also assume that Russia is preparing provocations at the dams to blame Ukraine for environmental and humanitarian consequences.&quot; This can be used to mobilize the population and divert attention from internal problems, he added. Moscow has not yet commented on the statement. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Sarantsev did not mention any specific dams in the statement quoted by the Kharkiv group of forces. In Belgorod Oblast, there are 1,100 ponds and four artificial water reservoirs, including the Belgorod reservoir south of the city, covering an area of over 2,500 square kilometers (960 square miles). Russia destroyed the occupied Kakhovka dam in Ukraine&apos;s Kherson Oblast in June 2023, unleashing massive floods and an environmental and humanitarian disaster across southern Ukraine. Russian forces also damaged the dams and the adjacent hydroelectric power plants in Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia during mass aerial attacks against energy infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-mining-dams-in-belgorod-oblast-kyiv-says/	2024-09-19T09:24:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1258244285.jpg
Russia aims to increase drone production tenfold in 2024, Putin claims	Russia is planning to increase drone production &quot;almost ten times&quot; this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed on Sept. 19, Kremlin-controlled Interfax news agency reported. In 2023, the Russian army received about 140,000 drones of different types, according to Putin. This year, Moscow wants to produce 1.4 million, Putin said. Throughout Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing the way wars are fought. For outnumbered Ukrainian forces, drones have been one of the key weapons to strike Russian warships, naval bases, oil refineries, and airfields inside occupied territories and deep behind Russia&apos;s lines. &quot;The key task is to produce a wide range of unmanned aerial vehicles, to establish mass production of such promising equipment as quickly as possible,&quot; the Russian president said at a meeting with Russia&apos;s military-industrial commission. &quot;Along with the development of drones, we also need to examine ways to destroy them with electronic warfare and conventional means.&quot; Moscow wants to design, test, and produce drones using Russian special research and production centers. Russia is also developing naval drones, Putin claimed. Russia has widely deployed drone capabilities during the war, both on the battlefield and to attack Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Ukraine has proven to be a pioneer in drone technology, with 1 million drones contracted by Ukrainian manufacturers through 2024, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Kyiv has the production capacity to produce more than 3 million drones a year but requires financing from foreign partners, Deputy Strategic Industries Minister Hanna Hvozdiar said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-aims-to-increase-drone-production-tenfold-putin-claims/	2024-09-19T09:18:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170784701.jpg
Ukraine's victory delayed by West's fears of Russian defeat, Canadian-Ukrainian lawyer turned soldier says	Daniel Bilak is a Canadian-Ukrainian lawyer living in Ukraine for decades, taking on critical roles in what has been a rollercoaster career amidst Ukraine&apos;s fight to prosper while defending its freedom. He has played a big role in attracting investment into the country, first as a lawyer and later, from 2016 to 2019, as chief investment advisor to Ukraine&apos;s prime minister and head of the government&apos;s UkraineInvest agency. After Russia launched its full-scale invasion in early 2022, Bilak joined Ukraine&apos;s Territorial Defense Forces and is now part of a unit that protects Kyiv&apos;s skies from Russian drones and missiles. As a partner at the Kyiv offices of Kinstellar, Bilak simultaneously continues work as a lawyer. Kinstellar has advised German defense industry giant Rheinmetall on forging a cooperation agreement with Ukraine&apos;s state-owned arms concern Ukroboronprom that involves joint maintenance of military equipment provided by Germany, as well as the future &quot;transfer of technology, (and) joint production of selected Rheinmetall products in Ukraine.&quot; While still Ukraine&apos;s defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov issued an award to Bilak recognizing his work &quot;For Support of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.&quot; The Kyiv Independent interviewed Bilak, asking the lawyer-turned-soldier about how the West sees Ukraine, why it takes so much time to receive the required arms and military technology, and how safe it is for companies, including military ones, to invest in Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent: There are discussions in the West that people are getting tired of helping Ukraine. What would you say to those who feel this way? Daniel Bilak: These people who say they&apos;re tired of Ukraine have never faced an enemy like the one that we are facing. The gruesome brutality of a genocidal colonial empire is an awesome thing to behold. It&apos;s absolutely astounding that we have held them off. We&apos;ve been supported by our allies, but not enough. And this is the biggest problem that the West and democracies have &#x2013; understanding that Ukraine is at the epicenter of global change, but also the epicenter of global security. What happens here is going to determine what happens in other places, in the Middle East, in Taiwan, in Southeast Asia, and in Africa. Because if we have dictators running around unhinged, unfettered, and completely without any sort of accountability for their actions &#x2026; we will see the end of the international world order. We&apos;re repeating all of that, this soft appeasement. I mean, the Poles of all people, the Latvians, the Romanians are afraid to shoot down Russian Shahed (Iranian drones provided to Russia) that invade their airspace. (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&apos;s great strategic victory to this point has been getting inside the heads of U.S. President Joe Biden and Germany Chancellor Olaf Scholz, especially. There are others that he has forced to self-deter. For six months, we basically held them off by ourselves at enormous cost when the Americans and our other allies were not funding us. We were begging for anti-missile systems to at least close the skies over Kharkiv, Dnipro, and Odesa, which were being just pulverized. Seven Patriot missile systems we asked for out of a hundred that are in Europe, and nobody gave us anything. The burning 12-story residential building hit by Russian forces on Aug. 30, 2024, in Kharkiv, Ukraine. (Governor Oleh Syniehubov/Telegram)The Kyiv Independent: How do you explain that? Daniel Bilak: The West is really playing with fire in not understanding that its own security, especially the security of the European continent, runs through Ukraine. And unless you stand up to dictators, they will always double down. Putin has gotten inside their heads. He&apos;s got all these red lines, and everybody&apos;s afraid to cross. I mean, this is a guy who hid inside a bunker for two years because he was afraid of a virus. It&apos;s highly unlikely that he&apos;s going to launch a nuclear war. In fact, the heads of the CIA and British MI5 basically said the other day in an interview that he&apos;s just gaming us, and he&apos;s making the Americans and the Germans especially self-deter. It&apos;s not just that they&apos;re afraid of Putin. They&apos;re afraid of the consequences of what happens if Russia loses. They are afraid of us winning. They know we can win this war and defeat the Russians. We drove them out of Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Kherson. Had our allies not stopped us, we probably could have won this war by the spring of 2023. But this fear of what happens if Russia loses is basically creating a situation where they&apos;re holding us on a tight leash. It is morally repugnant to have a policy that says we will not allow the Ukrainians to defend themselves by giving them long-range weapons to hit Russian targets inside Russia that are killing Ukrainian citizens. And that is something that the leaders of our allies are going to have to be held accountable for. And there&apos;s no reason for it because of this great fear of some sort of escalation. We crossed all of Putin&apos;s red lines, from HIMARS to battle tanks, to the Black Sea, to other systems. And now we crossed the ultimate red line, which was invading Russia in Kursk. And what was Putin&apos;s response? By invading Kursk, by invading Russia, Ukraine has shown that all of these red lines don&apos;t mean anything. The Kyiv Independent: Why don&apos;t they want Ukraine to win? Daniel Bilak: Because they&apos;re afraid of Russia losing. They&apos;re afraid of the consequences in case Russia collapses. This is the same thing that happened in 1991 when George H. W. Bush came to Kyiv and gave his so-called &apos;chicken Kyiv&apos; speech to warn Ukrainians against suicidal nationalism. &apos;Don&apos;t leave the Soviet Union,&apos; because they were worried about what would happen to the nuclear weapons. Well, in the end, everything worked out. We actually gave up the nuclear weapons that were on our territory and let the Russians keep theirs, and now we have the situation that we&apos;re actually paying for that decision. The Kyiv Independent: Is it safe to invest in Ukraine now? Daniel Bilak: Our firm, Kinstellar, works (on this) very, very deeply &#x2026; the most immediate trend is investing in the defense sector. And that includes large prime contractors, as they&apos;re called. These are global giants &#x2013; Rheinmetall, KNDS, Babcock, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, all of whom are looking to invest in Ukraine. As well as the military technology sector, which is involved, especially in the drone space. It&apos;s very hard for me to even convey what a seismic shift this is in the economy and for the military. When I was at UkraineInvest, I was trying to hive off Antonov from Ukroboronprom, which is now called Ukrainian Defense Industries. It wasn&apos;t even a company &#x2013; the government called it a defense concern, and it had hundreds, if not thousands of companies under it. It was a monopolist. All of that has now changed. And a lot of these big companies are coming into Ukraine now for the first time &#x2013; nobody was ever allowed in before. But now they&apos;re coming in with their investments, their technology, their know-how. And they are doing joint ventures with state-owned enterprises to build a Ukrainian, dynamic economic hub. It&apos;s easier to do defense manufacturing now in Ukraine than in almost any other place in Europe, because we have a very big need for that. Then you have the other side, which is drones. We are advancing technologically. Some British companies told me we&apos;re 30 years ahead of them because our technologies go through iterations and generational changes every three months instead of every three years. And nobody can keep up with this pace of change. And so there are ways for Ukrainian drone companies and drone companies abroad to work together because they need access to our technologies, and we need access to some of their technologies and to their components. We want to swap out the Chinese components and use British, or U.S., or German &#x2013; or from other countries. Photo for illustrative purposes.

(Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu via Getty Images)We will become a really essential part of the global supply chains of these military giants down the road. Once the war ends, we will continue to produce military goods, but we will have lots of other things to do. The construction and infrastructure sector is going to be a massive undertaking. We have whole cities to rebuild. Energy sector is also part of it, but we are not going to go back to building massive Soviet hydroelectric or nuclear plants. We may move to small mobile nuclear reactors, or to something smaller for district heating operations. We can&apos;t make these (military) targets of big plants anymore. So the national security aspects are going to become part of the design of the economic aspect of rebuilding Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent: Let&apos;s talk about the Russian narratives that are spread about Ukraine abroad. Do you think that Ukraine succeeded in messaging to the West about the Russian war against Ukraine? What can be improved? What should change? Daniel Bilak: Russia has been doing disinformation for many years. It is very complicated for Ukrainians to get their message out. I was trying to do that when I was at UkraineInvest, but you have to have people willing to listen. And unfortunately, Russia has &apos;useful idiots&apos; in the media in the West, or paid agents. These echo chambers have a positive view of Russia and a negative view of Ukraine. And it&apos;s very difficult to break that. I think the war started doing that, but we still see the reporting in many Western newspapers as being sort of slanted towards &apos;Russia&apos;s so much bigger and it&apos;s so much stronger.&apos; And none of that has any basis in reality on the ground, but it&apos;s a matter of the perceptions. And once those public perceptions are formed and they&apos;re in the heads of policymakers, media, and the general public, it&apos;s really hard to break. There has been some great reporting in the United States and in other countries about what&apos;s happening in Ukraine and how resilient we are. Russia&apos;s preparing for a war with NATO. And I think that NATO countries are starting to understand that. The chiefs of the defense staff of many NATO countries have spoken about this. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg talked about this. Russian President Vladimir Putin during his speech at the meeting in Zaryadye Hall, marking the City Day in Moscow, Russia Sep. 7, 2024. (Contributor/Getty Images)Everybody knows that within 3, or 5, or 7 years, there could be a major war with Russia if the Ukraine issue isn&apos;t solved. And Russia knows it&apos;s not ready to fight NATO militarily. So what it&apos;s trying to do is undermine the faith of people, of citizens in democratic countries, in the legitimacy of their institutions &#x2013; that there is no truth, that there is nothing you can really do. (Russia is) creating fake websites and NGOs that then fund extremist groups. It&apos;s a very, very sophisticated disinformation campaign, plus sabotage. The only way you can deal with it is, to tell the truth, but you need influencers to tell the truth or to point out the facts, just as the United States did with the Russian invasion of Ukraine and is still doing with other Russia plans to create false flag operations. The Kyiv Independent: If there&apos;s one Russian narrative that is the most dangerous at the moment that has been spread around, what is it? Daniel Bilak: The Russian idea that Ukraine has no hope of winning, and the West should stop supporting it because it&apos;s a waste of time. &apos;Get them to the table and capitulate.&apos;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-victory-delayed-by-wests-fears-of-russian-defeat-canadian-ukrainian-lawyer-turned-soldier-says/	2024-09-19T09:18:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/upd.jpg
Ukrainian drones are burning Russia’s oil refineries, but not its economy	Ukraine&#x2019;s drone attacks on Russian oil refineries are trying to achieve what Western sanctions couldn&#x2019;t: grinding down what fuels Russia&#x2019;s war machine and the backbone of its economy in an echo of the Allies&apos; oil bombing campaign on German assets in World War II. Since the start of the year, Ukrainian drones have hit around 33 oil assets, mostly refineries, in Russia, OSINT group Liveuamap told the Kyiv Independent. Although Kyiv has not confirmed the exact number, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in June that over 30 oil targets have been hit, some in regions bordering Ukraine near Russian military staging areas and others as deep as 1,500 kilometers into Russia. Oil refineries, which turn crude oil into products like gasoline and diesel, are the Kremlin&#x2019;s cash cow. Just last month, Russia earned an estimated $520 million per day from crude exports and oil product sea exports, according to the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). An infographic showing the locations of Ukraine&apos;s attack on Russian oil assets in 2024. (Lisa Kukharska / The Kyiv Independent)The viral videos of drones slamming into refineries have boosted morale in Ukraine and undermined the Kremlin. However, the tangible impact may not be as great as Ukraine initially hoped. While oil companies have likely spent tens of millions of dollars repairing facilities, it&#x2019;s a drop in the ocean compared to their multibillion-dollar turnover. While Ukraine&#x2019;s campaign has significantly diminished the volume of Russia&#x2019;s oil refining, &#x201C;this has not had a strategic effect on Russia,&#x201D; a Western official told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity. &quot;These strikes are primarily aimed at fuel refining installations that are supporting Russian front-line forces rather than the economy as a whole.&#x201D; Ukrainian drones can fly greater distances than ever before, putting over half of Russia&#x2019;s total refining capability in the firing line, which totals around 3.7 million barrels per day, according to a report from the U.K.-based Oxford Institute for Energy Studies (OIES). Russia claims the strikes make little difference, saying last week that it has improved its air defense. However, the oil sector has classified its production and output data, hinting that the situation could be worse than they are letting on, according to Talya Vatman, Russia, Caspian, and Black Sea Programme Manager at the International Energy Agency (IEA). Alleged footage of a burning oil terminal in Smolensk Oblast, Russia, on April 24, 2024. (Open sources/X).A fire in Russia&apos;s Tambov Oblast on June 20, 2024, after a reported Ukrainian drone strike against an oil depot. (Open sources/Telegram).&#x201C;While all statements from Russian oil companies and the Kremlin are in lockstep, saying that there is no impact, this decision looks like a strategic one that could imply that production has been hit,&#x201D; she told the Kyiv Independent. According to Vatman, the strike on Sept. 1 at Gazprom Neft&#x2019;s Moscow oil refinery will &#x201C;significantly&#x201D; impede its production capability after a blaze at the Euro+ refining unit forced operations to shut down. While the campaign has not altered global prices for oil products, Vatman said the attacks could bruise the reliability of Russian oil product imports. In response, traders may turn away from Russia and look for alternative, more stable sources. But traders that continue to import cheap Russian crude and oil products are likely &#x201C;not afraid of the volatility and risks,&#x201D; according to Sergey Vakulenko, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center and former head of strategy and innovations at Gazprom Neft. He noted that the effects of the attacks were strongest following a heavy drone campaign by Ukraine in March that targeted 14 refineries. Gasoline production dropped from 850,000 metric tons per month to 770,000 metric tons in April and May, according to CREA. By July, Russia&apos;s oil refining had reduced by around 17%, a NATO official told reporters. Russia has since bounced back from the March attacks and sea exports have steadily risen since May. They are still below the levels in the first four months of the year, likely due to OPEC+ restrictions in summer and an extended government ban on gasoline exports until the end of the year. &#x201C;This measure has been taken in the past when the domestic gasoline supply-demand balance has been very tight, and authorities are worried about prices on the domestic market going up,&quot; Vatman said. An infographics of Russian&apos;s oil export revenue. (Lisa Kukharska / The Kyiv Independent)While sea export volumes have improved, their revenues dropped by 7% month-on-month in August, according to CREA. But the declining revenues are less likely to do with the attacks and more down to sliding global oil prices, according to Vakulenko. Ultimately, Russia&#x2019;s oil sector is too big to feel a substantial impact from drone attacks, Vakulenko wrote in a Carnegie report. While drones are cost-effective, they can only carry payloads between 5&#x2013;50 kilograms; enough to impair sensitive parts of the refineries, like distillation towers, but not enough to wipe it out completely. The situation could change if the West allows Ukraine to use Western-made long-range missiles on Russian territory. Missiles can carry hundreds of kilograms of explosives, inflicting far more damage, Vakulenko said. Although they are unlikely to be able to destroy multiple oil refinery installations at once, he added. Moreover, missiles are pricey, with each one costing over $1 million, and Ukraine is unlikely to use them on assets like oil refineries as it could also be &#x201C;politically problematic with the West,&#x201D; Sascha Bruchmann, a visiting fellow at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (ISS), told the Kyiv Independent. But missiles could wreck Russia&#x2019;s air defense systems, forcing Russia to relocate the remaining systems away from oil assets and closer to the frontline, he added. This may pave the wave for fleets of drones with higher payloads to penetrate Russia&#x2019;s airspace undetected, he said. &#x201C;Missiles and drones reinforce each other and give commanders more flexibility,&#x201D; he said. So far, the attacks have largely concentrated on oil refining rather than exploration and production assets. Ukrainian drones have also hit Russia&#x2019;s electricity infrastructure, which could also be a target for long-range missiles to cut off Russia&#x2019;s military and defense industries. Even if Ukraine manages to take out all the refineries within its reach, Vakulenko says Russia can still cover its military, domestic, and economic needs and could turn to neighboring Belarus to recuperate the losses.

(Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images)This does not mean Russia&#x2019;s oil industry is in the clear. Western embargos are beginning to bite, leading to longer export distances and higher transport costs for Russian companies which depletes their profits and subsequently taxes for Russia&#x2019;s state budget, Petras Katinas, Energy Analyst at CREA, told the Kyiv Independent. Sanctions are also hindering Russian oil companies&apos; ability to modernize and update their IT systems, which rely on Western technologies. Companies could face operational difficulties and lower inefficiency without access to replacements or updates, causing disruptions in refining and production capabilities, Katinas predicts. Moscow is also battling with oil companies that are surreptitiously seeking higher profits, Katinas claims. Certain companies are buying gasoline at lower domestic rates and reselling it abroad for more, driving up domestic demand and prices. Prioritizing premium markets, like China, India, and Turkey, gives higher returns to companies but &#x201C;undermines the government&#x2019;s strategy to balance domestic needs with international market pressures,&#x201D; Katinas said. &#x201C;While a complete collapse of the Russian oil sector is unlikely in the short term, it does face substantial risks and challenges that could lead to long-term decline,&#x201D; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-are-burning-russias-oil-refineries-but-not-its-economy/	2024-09-19T09:11:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1209343722.jpg
With few easy options, Ukraine votes to raise taxes on stressed citizens	Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament voted to approve a tax hike for the first time since the full-scale war broke out, turning to a politically unpopular move as the country continually struggles to find new sources of funding for its growing wartime budget. The bill passed in parliament as part of a plan to fund a newly approved Hr 500 billion ($12 billion) defense spending increase for the year. The country is facing a $35 billion budget deficit next year, and as Russia&#x2019;s war continues in its third year with no end in sight, the country needs to find funding to keep its economy afloat and finance its war effort. &#x201C;(Raising taxes) was put off to the last possible moment, when it really became obvious that if we do not collect this money, we will not have money to pay salaries to service people,&#x201D; Yuri Gaidai, senior economist at the Kyiv-based Center for Economic Strategy (CES), told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;There aren&#x2019;t many similar situations in history when a country in a war of such scale doesn&apos;t raise taxes,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;but there is an unwillingness (in the government) to make unpopular decisions.&#x201D; The tax hike will fund around Hr 60.2 billion ($1.45 billion) in 2024 and Hr 122 billion ($2.94 billion) in 2025, according to the Finance Ministry. The majority of the $12 billion defense budget increase will be financed through issuing domestic government bonds and reduced expenses from refinancing existing state debt. The tax law still needs to pass a second reading, which is not expected until next month, and then it will need to be signed by the president. &#x201C;The Government of Ukraine has already exhausted all possibilities to quickly meet the additional needs of the military state budget without revising taxes,&#x201D; the Finance Ministry told the Kyiv Independent in a statement. &#x201C;The Finance Minister and his deputies held dozens of meetings with representatives of leading Ukrainian economic and financial organizations, as well as analytical centers and associations from various sectors of the economy. All the participants in the discussions expressed their understanding of the importance and necessity of the prompt search for resources to meet the additional needs of the security and defense sector,&#x201D; the statement read.

(Roman Pilipey /AFP via Getty Images)The bill will increase the added military tax from 1.5% to 5%, set higher taxes for self-employed people, retroactively double taxes on bank profits in 2024 to 50%, and raise taxes on the profits of other financial institutions to 25%, among other changes. The increased tax on bank profits was not originally included in a draft of the bill that failed to pass earlier in the month but was expected by many after Ukraine&#x2019;s banks made record profits in 2024 and after a similar retroactive hike was carried out in December 2023 for profits that year. In August, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that Ukraine faces a budget deficit of $35 billion next year, with $20 billion expected to be covered by the EU&apos;s Ukraine Facility program and by assistance from the International Monetary Fund. The remaining $15 billion needs to be sourced from partners or domestically. The government has moved to raise taxes despite significant pushback from Ukrainian businesses, who argued the burden was unfairly placed on law-abiding businesses and that the government should do more to boost revenues from tax dodgers first. Several prominent business leaders spoke out against the move when it was proposed over the summer. &#xA0;In a July statement, the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine said that the proposed tax hike discriminates against &#x201C;bonafide transparent taxpayers,&#x201D; adding that &#x201C;losses from the illicit markets of excisable goods over the last year alone exceed $1 billion.&#x201D; &#x201C;All efforts must be made to ensure that individuals and legal entities operating in Ukraine pay their fair share of taxes in effect today,&#x201D; the chamber said. Raising taxes was a &#x201C;necessary and unavoidable decision,&#x201D; said Gaidai of CES. &#x201C;But in my opinion, this is not the best tax increase design possible, because it puts all the burden on those who already pay their fair share of taxes.&#x201D; Even prior to the tax hike, Ukrainian men were increasingly avoiding official employment over fears of mobilization, moving into &#x201C;grey&#x201D; markets, or ceasing work altogether where they are harder to track by conscription officers. The burden of the new law falls disproportionately on those who have continued operating above board. Separately, the decision to raise bank profit taxes was made over the objections of Ukraine&#x2019;s central bank, which noted that banks were already taxed higher than any other sector of Ukraine&#x2019;s economy. &#x201C;We do not support the reapplying of the 50% income tax rate for banks this year,&#x201D; said Andrii Pyshnyi, head of the National Bank of Ukraine, during the bank&#x2019;s monthly press briefing on Sept. 19.

(Andrew Kravchenko/Bloomberg via Getty Images)&#x201C;Unfortunately, we see that the risks and harms of this decision may actually outweigh the fiscal effect,&#x201D; he said, noting that the central bank already restricts bank profit distribution. &#x201C;All the profit of the banking system remains in the system and works for capital growth. Capital, accordingly, creates additional opportunities for credit support of Ukrainian business.&#x201D; Pyshnyi said the bank is planning to discuss this with the Finance Ministry prior to the law&#x2019;s second reading. Facing pressure to take action on illegal markets, Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament also passed a new law to reform the customs service. Major business associations in Ukraine had championed the bill. However, the change is not expected to increase budget revenues any time soon, because of the time needed to implement the reforms, which include a competitive process to select an independent leader and help with vetting from international partners. &#x201C;I would say that this situation with the budget was one of the political enablers for this reform to actually be voted on. Because there is huge pressure from people and from businesses to actually not only raise tax rates but to work on more even tax compliance and on leveling the field,&#x201D; said Gaidai.	https://kyivindependent.com/with-few-easy-options-ukraine-votes-to-raise-taxes-on-its-stressed-citizens/	2024-09-19T08:58:26-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167567610.jpg
An evil axis' — JP Morgan CEO issues stark economic warning over Russia, Iran, North Korea	JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said people should be less focused on recent U.S. economic news, and instead worry about what he described as &quot;an axis of evil&quot; that could &quot;affect the free and Democratic world for the next 100 years.&quot; Speaking at the 2024 Financial Markets Quality Conference in Washington D.C. on Sept. 17, Dimon pointed to Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine in answering questions about the first U.S. central bank interest cut in four years, and its potential impact on the global economy. &quot;The most important thing that dwarfs all other things, that&apos;s really far more important today than it&apos;s been probably since 1945 is the war in Ukraine, what&apos;s going on in Israel, in the Middle East, America&apos;s relations with China, and the attack fundamentally on the rule of law that was set up after World War II,&quot; Dimon, who is regarded as one of the world&#x2019;s top bankers, said. Dimon said that aside from the two world wars, &quot;very few&quot; wars and conflicts dramatically affected the global economy, but said the current global instability was affecting food supplies, migration, and oil supply &quot;and it&apos;s getting worse all the time.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s serious,&quot; Dimon said, adding: &quot;There&apos;s been almost a million casualties in the Ukraine war, something like 20,000 Ukrainian kids have been kidnapped and sent to Russia. &quot;It&apos;s on the border of Europe. There&apos;s the threat of nuclear blackmail,&quot; he added. Russia has consistently issued threats, including nuclear ones, since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But as discussions between Ukraine and its Western allies over possible long-range missile strikes deep inside Russian territory have progressed in recent weeks, Russian President Vladimir Putin and other officials have upped their rhetoric, claiming that such a move would equate to NATO waging war with Moscow. Dimon described &quot;Iran, North Korea and Russia&quot; as an &quot;evil axis who are working every day on how to make it worse for the Western world and for America.&quot; Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, speaks during the 2024 Financial Markets Quality Conference at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, Sept. 17, 2024 (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has deepened ties with both North Korea and Iran. Both Kyiv and Washington have previously said that Russia has been using North Korean-produced missiles to attack Ukraine. In March, Ukrainian prosecutors reported that Russia had fired around 50 such missiles to attack six Ukrainian oblasts since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. In exchange for the ammunition, Russia reportedly provided North Korea with technology to help it deploy spy satellites as well as tanks and aircraft. In late June, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Pyongyang, where he signed a partnership agreement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which pledged to provide aid to one another if either will be attacked. More recently, the U.S. confirmed on Sept. 10 that Iran has provided Russia with shipments of Fath-360 close-range ballistic missiles. Tehran has also provided Moscow with thousands of Shahed kamikaze drones since the start of the all-out war. &quot;This may affect the free and democratic world for the next 100 years,&quot; Dimon said, adding people were &quot;overly focused&quot; on how the interest rate cut would affect markets. &quot;Honestly, most of us have already been through that stuff, it doesn&apos;t matter as much,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s ratcheting up folks and it takes really strong American leadership and Western world leadership to do something about it. That&apos;s my number one concern.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/an-evil-axis-jp-morgan-ceo-issues-stark-economic-warning-over-russia-iran-north-korea/	2024-09-19T08:43:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2157787216.jpg

Moldova's ex-military chief charged with treason over alleged espionage for Russia	Igor Gorgan, the former chief of staff of the Moldovan military, has been charged with treason, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported on Sept. 19, citing the country&apos;s prosecutors. The Prosecutor&apos;s Office for Combating Organized Crime and Special Cases said that Gorgan stands &quot;accused in the case concerning alleged espionage on behalf of Russia.&quot; The investigative outlet The Insider wrote in June that Gorgan had been an informant of the Russian military intelligence agency (GRU) for years. The Moldovan officer served as the chief of the General Staff between 2013 and 2016 and was reappointed to the position in 2019 under pro-Russian President Igor Dodon before losing the position again in 2021 at pro-Western President Maia Sandu&apos;s request. Even after losing office, the general has been using his contacts in the Defense Ministry and has passed sensitive information on Moldova and Ukraine to Russia, The Insider wrote. This reportedly included intelligence on military aid routes from Romania to Ukraine and on the political situation in Moldova. While it is unclear when Gorgan&apos;s alleged cooperation with GRU began, their mutual communication reportedly became particularly active in April 2022, that is, shortly after the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine. Following the media investigation, Moldovan authorities launched a criminal case regarding data transmission related to the national defense system. The prosecutors said the investigation into &quot;the nature and content of the allegedly transmitted information&quot; is ongoing. Gorgan has denied the accusations and called the media investigation fake. Chisinau has been supportive of Ukraine throughout the full-scale war and cracked down on Russian subversive operations at home, expelling dozens of diplomats and embassy staff in July 2023 after revelations of espionage activities. Russia&apos;s invasion sparked fears in Moldova of a possible spillover of hostilities, namely via the Russian-occupied Moldovan region of Transnistria.	https://kyivindependent.com/moldovas-ex-military-chief-charged-with-treason/	2024-09-19T08:03:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/Gorgan-2.jpg
