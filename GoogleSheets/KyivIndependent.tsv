The Ukrainian Air Force reported downing 46 out of 52 drones launched by Russia overnight. Russia also launched three Kh-59/69 guided air missiles. An attack on Kropyvnytskyi in central Ukraine&apos;s Kirovohrad Oblast killed one person and injured a 90-year-old woman. The woman &quot;received minor injuries&quot; and did not require hospitalization, Kirovohrad Oblast Governor Andriy Raikovych said.

Civilians evacuated amid drone attack in Russia’s Tver Oblast, Russian governor claims	Local authorities have partially evacuated residents of Toropets in Russia&#x2019;s Tver Oblast after a mass drone attack overnight caused a large fire, Tver Oblast Governor Igor Rudenya claimed on Sept. 18. Photos and videos shared on Russian Telegram channels showed a number of explosions and a large plume of smoke, purportedly at the site of an ammunition depot in Toropets. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the location of the explosions. &#xA0; Toropets has a population of 11,000, and is situated around 470 kilometers (292 miles) north of the Ukrainian border and over 370 kilometers (230 miles) west of Moscow. &quot;A fire started as a result of drone wreckage falling while air defense forces were repelling an attack,&quot; Rudenya claimed on Telegram at 3:30 a.m. local time, adding that the situation was under control. At 4 a.m. local time, Rudenya announced the decision &quot;to partially evacuate the population from the territory where air defense is operating and the fire is being localized&quot; as air defense continued to &quot;repel a massive attack of drones in the sky above the city.&quot; &quot;The necessary measures are being taken. The situation is under control.&quot; According to state media outlet RIA Novosti, the population was being evacuated to the town of Zapadnaya Dvina, 35 kilometers (22 miles) southeast of Toropets. &#xA0; Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed that 54 Ukrainian drones had been downed overnight, but did not mention any drones downed over Tver Oblast. According to the Russian Defense Ministry&apos;s 8 a.m. report, 27 drones were downed over Kursk Oblast, 16 over Bryansk Oblast, seven over Smolensk Oblast, three over Belgorod Oblast, and one over Oryol Oblast. Kyiv did not comment on Moscow&apos;s claims, but Ukraine is known to use domestically-produced drones to strike targets deep inside Russia. A previous drone attack on Tver Oblast reportedly targeted a major chemical research plant. Images and videos shared by local residents on Russian Telegram channels appeared to show a large explosion on June 27 near Redkino, home to the Redkinsky plant. At the time, Rudenya only claimed that a drone was downed over Konakovsky district in Tver Oblast, the same area in which the Redkinsky plant is located.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-evacuates-population-in-tver-oblast-claims-mass-drone-attack/	2024-09-17T23:15:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2161636670.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 637,010 troops since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 637010 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Sept. 18. This number includes 1,130 casualties Russian forces suffered over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 8,691 tanks, 17,080 armored fighting vehicles, 24,784 vehicles and fuel tanks, 18,154 artillery systems, 1,188 multiple launch rocket systems, 947 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 328 helicopters, 15354 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-637010-troops-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-09-17T22:12:26-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1761821636-1.jpg
Georgian parliament passes anti-LGBTQ legislation	Georgia&apos;s parliament passed a package of anti-LGBTQ laws on Sept. 17 in its third reading. The bills will still need to be signed by pro-Western President Salome Zourabichvili to become law &#x2014; but a veto by the president can still be overcome by a subsequent vote in parliament. The package of laws, based around a core bill entitled &quot;On Protection of Family Values and Minors,&quot; was first proposed in March by Mamuka Mdinaradze, the leader of the ruling Georgian Dream party&apos;s faction in parliament. It mirrors similar moves in Russia, particularly a decision by Russia&apos;s Supreme Court in November 2023 to declare &quot;the international LGBT social movement&quot; to be &quot;an extremist organization&quot; and ban all its activities. The bills would ban gender transition, adoption by same-sex couples, and forbid gatherings or the distribution of information &quot;aimed at promoting&quot; LGBTQ relationships. After the law was initially proposed, Mdinaradze said it was necessary to &quot;protect society from pseudo-liberal ideology and its inevitable harmful consequences.&quot; Ahead of its passage, a group of 32 civil society organizations released a statement condemning the legislation, saying that it was aimed at &quot;manipulating the public before the elections, covering up real problems, inciting irrational fear, and creating another obstacle on the road to the country&apos;s European integration.&quot; The bills do nothing to address real problems faced by families in Georgia, such as poverty, inflation, and inadequate access to education, the statement said. The statement further called on President Zourabichvili to veto the legislation. It was the latest in a pattern of government measures that aim to restrict the rights of LGBTQ people in Georgia. The previous year, police in Tbilisi failed to prevent thousands of far-right counterprotesters from descending on the capital&apos;s pride festival, resulting in fights and the cancellation of the event. The attack on the pride festival was organized in part by the ar-right and pro-Russian group Alt-Info. Two key members of Alt-Info were sanctioned by the U.S. for human rights abuses on Sept. 16.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-parliament-passes-anti-lgbtq-legislation/	2024-09-17T18:16:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1514301916.jpg
Sybiha to visit Romania in first official trip as Foreign Minister	Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha will visit Romania on Sept. 18, paying his first official visit to a foreign state since entering office earlier this month, Ukraine&apos;s foreign ministry announced. Sybiha, a career diplomat, replaced Dmytro Kuleba as Foreign Minister on Sept. 5, amid a large-scale reshuffle of the Ukrainian government. &#xA0; According to the ministry, Sybiha will visit Romania to hold bilateral negotiations with his Romanian counterpart Luminita Odobescu and other high-ranking officials. After the negotiations, the ministers will hold a joint press conference. The diplomats will reportedly discuss support for Kyiv&apos;s defense capabilities, Ukraine&apos;s path to membership in the European Union and NATO, &#xA0;and the implementation of President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Peace Formula. The negotiations in Bucharest will also focus on Black Sea security and the protection of the legal rights and interests of Ukrainian citizens in Romania. The visit kicks off Sybiha&apos;s regional tour of several neighboring states, the ministry said. The tour is meant to signal Ukraine&apos;s determination to develop a &quot;constructive ... mutually beneficial&quot; relationship with its neighbors. Romania, a NATO member, signed a security agreement with Ukraine in June and has pledged to send Kyiv a Patriot air defense system. Throughout the full-scale war, Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukrainian port infrastructure on the Danube River that separates Ukraine and Romania. Russian drone debris has crashed on Romanian soil multiple times.	https://kyivindependent.com/sybiha-to-visit-romania-in-first-official-trip-as-foreign-minister/	2024-09-17T17:16:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170361277.jpg
US believes Zelensky's peace strategy 'can work,' official says	U.S. officials have seen President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Victory Plan and believe it is a strategy &quot;that can work,&quot; U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said during a press briefing on Sept. 17. Zelensky on Sept. 16 said that his Victory Plan for Ukraine is over 90% complete, and that he will present the plan to allies next week. The details of the strategy have not been released to the public. Thomas-Greenfield confirmed that the U.S. is already familiar with the plan. &quot;We have seen President Zelensky&apos;s peace plan,&quot; she said during the U.N. briefing. &quot;We think it lays out a strategy and a plan that can work.&quot; Thomas-Greenfield said the U.S. hopes to promote Zelensky&apos;s plan among world leaders next week duringthe 79th U.N. General Assembly in New York.Zelensky previously said he plans to present his strategy for victory to U.S. President Joe Biden in September. While the contents of the plan are yet to be revealed, presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Sept. 17 that Zelensky&apos;s Victory Plan does not in any way include ceding territory to Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-believes-zelenskys-peace-strategy-can-work-official-says/	2024-09-17T15:05:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2155325629.jpg
Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia Oblast kills at least 2, injures 5	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia attacked Zaporizhzhia Oblast the night of Sept. 17, killing at least two civilians and injuring five others, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. Rescue workers are currently searching for people under the rubble, Fedorov said. Earlier in the night, Fedorov reported that explosions had occurred in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Fedorov later said that Russia &quot;massively attacked&quot; the region&apos;s Komyshuvakha community. The attack killed at least two people and injured five. The strike also damaged several homes and an infrastructure facility. Rescue workers are still on site, and the full extent of the damage is still being investigated. Russia has continued to strike civilian targets across Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Part of the region is occupied by Russian forces, who are attempting a breakthrough in the country&apos;s southeast. The city of Zaporizhzhia is located less than 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the front lines.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-in-zaporizhzhia-oblast-kills-at-least-2-injures-5/	2024-09-17T14:45:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/fedorov.jpg
Ukrainian boxer Usyk detained at Krakow airport	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Ukrainian boxer Oleksandr Usyk was arrested at the airport in Krakow, Poland, Ukrainian lawmaker Zhan Beleniuk said on Sept. 17. &quot;Oleksandr Usyk was arrested at the Krakow airport. The circumstances are being investigated,&quot; Beleniuk said via Telegram. Beleniuk also posted video of Usyk&apos;s arrest. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced shortly after midnight on Sept. 18 that Usyk had been released following the intervention of Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry. He also said he spoke to Usyk by phone while he was detained. &quot;I was outraged by this treatment of our citizen and champion,&quot; Zelensky said. Usyk&apos;s wife, Kateryna Usyk, wrote on social media that the arrest was not related to anything criminal. &quot;Everything is fine, nothing criminal,&quot; she said. On the instructions of Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Ukraine&apos;s Consul General in Krakow went to the airport to intervene on Usyk&apos;s behalf, ministry spokesperson Heorhy Tykhyi said in a statement. &quot;The Ukrainian side categorically rejects the attitude to its citizen and champion demonstrated in the video,&quot; Tykhyi said. Sybiha reportedly appealed to his Polish counterpart to resolve the situation. Usyk became the undisputed heavyweight world champion after defeating British boxer Tyson Fury back in May.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-boxer-usyk-detained-at-krakow-airport/	2024-09-17T14:09:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1797178122.jpg
MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak: Developments in Ukraine’s parliament on economic reforms, international obligations — Issue 73	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 73 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief&#x201D; newsletter, covering events from Sept. 9- Sept. 15, 2024. The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. The Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, adopted in the final reading draft law #6490-d on restarting the State Customs Service. The text of the draft law #6490-d for the second reading was designed and agreed with all key stakeholders including business associations, NGOs and international experts. The draft law incorporates all provisions on which international partners have insisted and meets all the requirements within the relevant benchmarks of the IMF, the World Bank and the EU (Ukraine Facility). The draft law introduces the transparent competitive procedure for the selection of the SCS head. The competition commission which will select candidates for the SCS head consists of three representatives delegated by the Finance Ministry and three international representatives. International representatives in the competition commission don&#x2019;t have a decisive vote and work under parity principles with Ukrainian members of the commission. The competition commission for selection of the new SCS head doesn&#x2019;t determine the winner, but submits two candidates for consideration to the Finance Ministry. The finance minister makes the final decision regarding the winner of the competition and submits only one candidate to be appointed by the Cabinet of Ministers. Moreover, among other key provisions of the draft law are: The next steps before the draft law comes into effect are signing by the Chair of the Verkhovna Rada and the president of Ukraine. The Tax Committee recommended for the first reading the draft law on increasing taxes. Today the Tax Committee reconsidered draft law #11416-d on tax increase after its rejection in the parliament. The difference in the revised version is just in the provision which raises the bank profit tax rate up to 50%. This provision was previously opposed by the Finance Ministry and the National Bank of Ukraine. The Verkhovna Rada will consider draft law #11416-d in the first reading during the plenary meetings scheduled for Sept. 17-18. The Budget Committee recommended a draft law with amendments to the State Budget 2024 for the second reading. Last week the Budget Committee recommended for the final reading the draft law #11417 on increasing defense spending by Hr 500 billion ($12 billion). In fact, a reduction of different budget programs by Hr 628 million ($15 million) was added to the second reading. Overall the draft law suggests a reduction of budget expenses by Hr 137 billion ($3.3 billion). In particular, Hr 115 billion ($2.8 billion) are savings from the state debt service and Hr 22 billion of other expenses. The Verkhovna Rada will consider draft law #11417 in the final reading during the plenary meetings scheduled for Sept. 17-18. The Parliament will adopt a draft law to restore medium-term local budgets. During plenary meetings scheduled for Sept. 17-18, the Verkhovna Rada will consider in the second readings draft law #11131 with the amendments to the Budget Code to restore medium-term planning of local budgets. This step is among Ukraine&#x2019;s intentions fixed in the Memorandum with the IMF. As we reported in Issue 63, the draft law restores medium-term planning of local budgets except for temporarily occupied territories or war zones, expands opportunities to use remaining funds, gives right for local councils to provide a financial guarantee for refinancing previously taken loans upon agreement with the Finance Ministry, allows local authorities not to apply the provisions of the Budget Code regarding the total volume of local debt for another six years until 2030. The Verkhovna Rada is going to adopt in the first reading a draft law to reform the Accounting Chamber. This week the Parliament will vote on the first reading of draft law #10044-d on the reform of the Accounting Chamber. The draft law suggests establishing a transparent competitive selection of the ACU&#x2019;s members with participation and the decisive vote of international experts, extending the mandate of the Accounting Chamber to all public finances, strengthening its independence, reducing a number of the ACU&#x2019;s members from 13 to 11, introducing an external audit with experts with international auditing experience. This week the Parliament will consider several draft laws from the World Bank requirements. During the parliamentary meetings scheduled for Sept, 17-18, the Verkhovna Rada will consider five draft laws which are required by the World Bank. The Parliament will vote on the final reading of the draft law #5819 on regulating rating agencies and #11474 to address the issue of privatization of the state banks. The Tax Committee recommended it for the second reading during its meeting on Monday. Moreover, the Verkhovna Rada will consider in the final reading draft law #11063-d on the State Agrarian Register and #10143 with the amendments to the Bankruptcy Code which are also obligations to the EU under the Ukraine Plan of Ukraine Facility. Furthermore, the Verkhovna Rada will consider in the first reading the new draft law #11520 on public procurements. The Cabinet of Ministers submitted to the parliament the draft law on the State Budget 2025. On Sept. 14, in line with the deadline required by the law, the Cabinet of Ministers submitted to the Verkhovna Rada draft law #12000 on the State Budget 2025. The draft law will be presented in the Parliament during the meetings scheduled for Sept. 17-18. The government expects Ukraine&apos;s GDP to grow by 2.7% (in 2024 it is expected to grow by 3.5%). Inflation at the end of next year is expected to be 9.5% (in contrast with 7.9% this year). The average annual exchange rate in 2025 is expected to be Hr 45 for 1 US dollar. The government left the main social indicators in the budget unchanged: minimum wage at the level of Hr 8,000 ($192) and general subsistence minimum of Hr 2,920 ($70). Budget revenues &#xA0;amount to Hr 2.336 trillion ($56 billion). They are expected to increase by Hr 192 billion ($4.6 billion) or by 9% compared to the 2024 plan. Most of this increase will be provided by revenues from direct taxes &#xA0;by Hr 179.8 billion ($4.3 billion). In particular, personal income taxes should increase by Hr 158 billion ($3.8 billion) and income tax by Hr 21.8 billion ($525 billion). The state budget deficit in 2025 is expected to be 19.4% of GDP or Hr 1.546 trillion ($37 billion). The government is planning to finance it mainly from external sources.	https://kyivindependent.com/mp-yaroslav-zhelezniak-developments-in-ukraines-parliament-on-economic-reforms-international-obligations-issue-73/	2024-09-17T13:22:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1398149194.jpg
Italy to deliver promised SAMP/T air defense system by end of September	Italy will deliver a second SAMP/T air defense battery to Ukraine by the end of September, Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said on Sept. 17. Italy promised in June to send Kyiv another SAMP/T system, the only European-made air defense system that can intercept ballistic missiles. &quot;By the end of the month the new Samp/T system will be delivered to Ukraine, and we know how much every minute of delay costs,&quot; Crosetto said at a conference on European air defense production, according to the Italian media outlet RAI. The announcement comes over a week after President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s visit to Italy on Sept. 6. Zelensky said during the visit that Ukraine is grateful for the air defenses supplied by Western allies, but that they are still &quot;not enough to secure our entire territory and repel every Russian attack.&quot; Ukraine has lobbied international partners for more air defense capabilities in the wake of intensifying Russian strikes targeting energy infrastructure. Previously, France and Italy jointly supplied Ukraine with a SAMP/T system back in 2023. Ukraine&apos;s need for advanced air defense systems has become more urgent in light of Iran&apos;s recent transfer of ballistic missiles to Russia. Italian media has also reported that Italy&apos;s next military aid package will include a batch of long-range Storm Shadow missiles along with the SAMP/T system, but officials have not confirmed these reports.	https://kyivindependent.com/italy-to-deliver-promised-samp-t-air-defense-system-by-end-of-september/	2024-09-17T13:08:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1251986460.jpg
Ukraine state-owned enterprises weekly — Issue 147	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This is issue 147 of Ukrainian State-Owned Enterprises Weekly, covering events from Sept. 8-14, 2024. The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission. Former Ukrenergo&#x2019;s CEO Kudrytskyi interviewed. Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, who was dismissed as Ukrenergo&#x2019;s CEO on Sept. 2, was interviewed by Ekonomichna Pravda (EP) this week. We selected the key issues: On dismissal: As we wrote in Issue 55 almost three years ago, there was an attempt to displace or dilute the management of Ukrenergo before the supervisory board was appointed in December 2021 &#x2013; that is, while the Energy Ministry was still exercising the powers of the supervisory board. Back then, the ministry only managed to terminate the powers of two Ukrenergo&#x2019;s executive board members, Andriy Nemyrovskyi and Maksym Yurkov. As we wrote in Issue 103, on Sept. 20, 2023, Ukrenergo reported that the Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office searched its head office by order of the Pechersk District Court issued on Aug. 30, 2023. Ukrenergo stated that it would have willingly provided investigators with all the necessary documents without a search, but law enforcers had not requested a voluntary handover. The documents of interest included some contracts that the State Audit Service of Ukraine (SASU) had audited by March 2023. According to liga.net, the search was part of a criminal case opened by the Internal Affairs Ministry on Sept. 16 2023, based on the results of that audit. The said contracts pertained to several companies that supplied goods and services to Ukrenergo in 2019-2023, the media reported. Ukrenergo said that it was challenging the audit results in court, as it considered them &#x201C;biased and unprofessional&#x201D; and &#x201C;some of them directly contradicting the law.&quot; As we reported in Issue 146, on Sept. 2, Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board dismissed Kudrytskyi by a majority vote. On the same day, Daniel Dobbeni (independent member and supervisory board chair) and Peder Andreasen (independent member) announced that they had filed their resignation notices. On the reasons for dismissal: On the protection of Ukrenergo&#x2019;s substations: As we wrote in Issue 145, the ostensible reason for Kudrytskyi&#x2019;s dismissal was allegedly insufficient protection of Ukrenergo&#x2019;s facilities and, as a result, problems with electricity that arose after a Russian attack on Aug. 26, 2024. On power rationing: As we reported in Issue 145, Ukraine faced the largest Russian missile and drone attack on its energy facilities. Due to the attack, Ukrenergo was forced to introduce power outages. On decentralized generation: On his plans after dismissal: Ten candidates may have applied for the position of PrivatBank&#x2019;s new CEO, Forbes Ukraine wrote. These supposedly include current top managers of PrivatBank and foreign bankers, the media added. According to Forbes Ukraine, several Ukrainians may have applied for the position: All of the above candidates either declined to comment on their possible participation in the competitive selection, neither denying nor confirming it, or did not respond, the media added. Note that disclosing the names of potential CEO candidates would be a poor practice that harms competitive selection. Firstly, the potential employer should ensure the confidentiality of candidates, as applicants would rarely want their current employer to know about their application. Secondly, this information is typically market-sensitive. According to Forbes Ukraine, the following foreign candidates have also applied for the CEO position: It is surprising that Forbes Ukraine chose to discriminate between &#x201C;Ukrainian&#x201D; and &#x201C;foreign&#x201D; candidates. All the &#x201C;Ukrainian&#x201D; candidates listed above also currently have other employers. In addition, one of them, Shevalev, serves as an alternate board director at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in London, U.K. &#x201C;I think, this time, there is a request to elect a Ukrainian rather than a foreign CEO,&#x201D; Forbes Ukraine&#x2019;s source hypothesized. As we reported in late June 2024, Gerhard Bosch filed his resignation as PrivatBank&#x2019;s CEO. See Issue 138 for more detail. As we wrote in September 2024, Bosch&#x2019;s contract would be terminated on Nov. 1, 2024. See Issue 146 for more detail. PrivatBank receives 400 million euros in portfolio guarantees from the EBRD for business lending. On Sept. 11, PrivatBank reported that it signed a risk-sharing agreement with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which would enable the issuance of new loans worth 400 million euros. According to the bank, this agreement includes lending support components: The new financing will increase opportunities for credit support to Ukrainian businesses and expand funding for projects that promote food production, energy efficiency, and energy production, PrivatBank also said. Ukrgasbank raises 150 million euos in EBRD&#x2019;s guarantees to finance investments in energy projects. On Sept. 12, Ukrgasbank reported that it joined the EBRD&#x2019;s Energy Security Support Facility (ESSF) program that would provide better access to finance for energy security investments in Ukraine. EBRD extends a 150 million euros portfolio-risk-sharing facility to Ukrgasbank, which will support its lending to small and medium-sized enterprises, households, municipalities, and medium-sized corporate clients for implementing decentralized energy generation and energy efficiency measures, the bank said. Through the ESSF, the EBRD covers part of the risk of the respective partner financial institutions for investment in decentralized energy generation, Ukrgasbank explained. Ukrnafta earns Hr 10.6 billion ($255 million) in net profit in January-June 2024 (audited). On Sept. 11, Ukrnafta released a statement saying that Crowe Erfolg Ukraine, Crowe Audit &amp; Accounting Ukraine completed its independent audit. Ukrnafta&#x2019;s financial statements were not available at the time of writing. In addition, the above statement suggests that Ukrnafta changed its auditor again. Before the company&#x2019;s shares were seized by the state in November 2022, its financial statements were audited by a Big Four firm, PwC. As we wrote in April 2024 (Issue 126), the company&#x2019;s results for 2023 were audited by Grant Thornton, who now appears to have audited Ukrnafta only that year. Ukrnafta also said that it paid Hr 20.2 billion ($486 million) to the state budget in taxes, duties, dividends, and customs payments for the first half of 2024. &#x201C;Since being managed by the state and run by the new management from the end of 2022, the company has received almost Hr 40 billion ($964 million) in profit,&#x201D; Ukrnafta&#x2019;s CEO Sergii Koretskyi said on his Facebook page. To the best of our knowledge, Ukrnafta has never disclosed its financial statements, either audited or unaudited, or other official reporting for 2022 or 2023. As we wrote in Issue 136, Ukrnafta said that it paid Hr 3.5 billion ($84 million) in dividends to Naftogaz, fully covering its dividend obligations for the previous year. In accordance with the Cabinet&#x2019;s decision, Ukrnafta must allocate 30% of its net profit for 2023 in dividends, provided that 50% of the profit is used for capital investments approved by the Cabinet in the company&#x2019;s 2024 financial plan. As we reported earlier, on March 1, the Cabinet of Ministers approved Ukrnafta&#x2019;s financial plan for 2024. Ukrnafta&#x2019;s CEO Serhii Koretskyi then said that Ukrnafta earned Hr 24 billion in net profit in 2023 (around $600 million at the time). See Issue 122 for more detail. As we wrote in Issue 115, Ukrnafta paid over Hr 25 billion (around $600 million) in taxes in 2023. As we wrote in SOE Weekly&#x2019;s Issue 90, Ukrnafta&#x2019;s financial plan for 2023, approved by the Cabinet of Ministers, expected Hr 74 billion ($1.8 million) in net income from operations, Hr 12 billion ($289 million) in net profit, and Hr 25 billion ($602 million) in tax payments. As we wrote in Issue 100, in his analysis for Forbes Ukraine, CASE Ukraine&#x2019;s economist Vasyl Povoroznyk contested Koretskyi&#x2019;s statements on the company&#x2019;s quarterly profits, lower costs, higher production, and transparency. He concluded that Ukrnafta&#x2019;s financial performance was driven by two factors: higher market prices for petrol and diesel (45% and 54%, respectively) and Ukrnafta&#x2019;s sale of gas which the company received as repayment of part of Naftogaz&#x2019;s historical debt to Ukrnafta. Povoroznyk also said that the financial reporting disclosed by Naftogaz &#x2014; Ukrnafta&#x2019;s majority shareholder who includes Ukrnafta&#x2019;s reporting in its consolidated reporting &#x2014; did not square with numbers named by Koretskyi. In Issue 68, we reported that the shares of Ukrnafta, Ukrtatnafta, Motor Sich, AvtoKrAZ, and Zaporizhzhiatransformator (ZTR) were seized &#x201C;for the needs of the state&#x201D; and transferred to the Defense Ministry on Nov. 6, 2022. After the seizure, the state replaced the supervisory boards and executive management at most of these companies. Former CEO of WOG gas stations chain Serhii Koretskyi became the CEO of both Ukrnafta and Ukrtatnafta on Nov. 8 and 10, respectively. See Issue 68 for detail. No public statements on the performance of the other company, Ukrtatnafta, audited or unaudited financial statements, or other official reporting for 2022, 2023, or the first half of 2024 are available in the public domain. The ninth attempt to sell Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi port fails. According to Prozorro.Sale, an auction for the sale of the Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi trade seaport, scheduled by the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) for Sept. 6, failed due to the absence of bidders. The starting price was Hr 178 million ($4.2 million). This was the ninth attempt to sell the port. According to CASE Ukraine, despite the attractiveness of the asset, there are no bidders because the port has debts of Hr 151.3 million ($3.6 million). The winner would also have to pay VAT of 20% of the purchase price. That is, in total, the new owner would have to pay at least Hr 365 million ($8.79 million), CASE Ukraine added. The SPFU scheduled another privatization auction for Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi for Sept. 16. The starting price halved to Hr 89 million ($2.14 million). This suggests that, based on CASE Ukraine&#x2019;s information, the winning bidder would have to pay at least Hr 258 million ($6.22 million) in total. The first privatization auction for Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi in March 2023 failed as no one registered. At the second auction, the seaport was sold for Hr 220 million (around $5.3 million at the time) to Ukrdoninvest LLC, a company owned by Ukrainian businessman Vitaliy Kropachov. However, Ukrdoninvest did not pay up. As we reported in April 2023 (Issue 85), the company said that it backed out while hashing out the terms of the purchase agreement with SPFU&#x2019;s regional office in Odesa and Mykolaiv oblasts. In June 2023, SPFU announced that it would put Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi up for privatization for a third time, another attempt that failed. (See Issue 93.)&#x202F;In Issues 99 and 100, we reported about the following failed attempts to sell the port. As we wrote in August 2024 (Issue 144), former Deputy Minister of Infrastructure Viktor Dovhan posted on Facebook suggesting that Polish investors were considering participating in the privatization of the port. For more detail, see SOE Weekly&#x2019;s Issues 74, 78, 79, 84, 85, 87, 93, 99, 100, and 144 &#x2013; SOE Weekly.

Ukraine war latest: 1 million killed, wounded in Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine, WSJ reports	Key developments on Sept. 17: Roughly 1 million Ukrainians and Russians have been killed or wounded in Moscow&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Sept. 17, citing undisclosed sources and Western intelligence estimates. Kyiv and Moscow have mostly avoided commenting on the casualties their forces suffered during the full-scale war, which has been ongoing for two and half years. A &quot;confidential Ukrainian estimate from earlier this year&quot; put Kyiv&apos;s losses at 80,000 soldiers killed and 400,000 wounded, the WSJ wrote, citing undisclosed sources. President Volodymyr Zelensky presented a much lower number of military fatalities in February - 31,000. He did not reveal the number of wounded troops. Western intelligence estimates cited by the WSJ placed Russian losses at up to 200,000 dead and 400,000 wounded. This is close to Kyiv&apos;s estimates on Moscow&apos;s casualties, which is over 635,000 killed and wounded as of Sept. 17. Leaked Pentagon documents reported on by The Economist in July suggested that Russian losses could be even more serious, with the highest estimate standing at 728,000 troops killed, injured, or captured. Moscow has not disclosed its casualties during the war. The last figure provided by Russian authorities was 5,937 killed soldiers as of September 2022. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The Ukrainian Navy recently carried out a missile strike on ammunition depots near the Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Mariupol, according to a Sept. 17 statement. The strike destroyed both the storage infrastructure and tons of ammunition that Russian troops were stockpiling for use against Ukraine, the Navy said. Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the exiled mayor of Mariupol, shared photos showing Russia&apos;s &quot;destroyed warehouses&quot; in the neighboring village of Hlyboke, Donetsk Oblast.. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Mariupol came under siege by Russian forces between February and May 2022, leaving thousands dead and reducing Mariupol to rubble. According to authorities&apos; rough estimates, at least 25,000 people may have been killed during the siege of Mariupol. The exact number remains unknown and could be much higher. None of the plans Ukraine is developing to end Russia&apos;s war envisages a ceasefire or ceding territory to Moscow, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Presidential Office, told Current Time on Sept. 17. Podolyak&apos;s statement echoed a recent comment of Dmytro Lytvyn, an advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky, who dismissed Bild&apos;s article saying that Kyiv was allegedly ready to freeze the conflict as part of its &quot;Victory Plan&quot; as &quot;fake.&quot; &quot;(Freezing of the conflict) will not lead to the end of the war but will only lead to Russia gaining the opportunity to accumulate additional resources and proceed to the third stage (of the war) with more mass killings of civilians in Ukraine,&quot; Podolyak said. &quot;There are no concepts of ceding territories, there are no concepts of freezing the conflict,&quot; he added. Kyiv has repeatedly rejected any ceasefire or temporary break in hostilities, saying it would only provide a window of opportunity for Russia to regroup its forces. Last month, Zelensky said that Ukraine&apos;s operations in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast were part of his &quot;Victory Plan.&quot; The other aspects of the plan include Ukraine&apos;s participation in the global security infrastructure, pressuring Russia to end the war through diplomatic means, and an economic aspect, Zelensky said without revealing further details. Ukraine&apos;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said on Sept. 17 that he had appealed to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations in response to a photo that allegedly shows the execution of a Ukrainian prisoner of war (POW) by Russia. On the morning of Sept. 17, a photo of an apparently executed Ukrainian soldier with a sword in his chest and the inscription &quot;For Kursk&quot; appeared on social media. Remnants of gray tape are visible on the soldier&apos;s hand. The photo appears to show a bloodied body lying on the road against the backdrop of damaged vehicles and a house with broken windows. The exact location is unclear. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the photo. &quot;The level of barbarism and bloodthirstiness is impossible to comprehend,&quot; Lubinets wrote on his Telegram channel. The ombudsman stressed that such actions are a flagrant violation of the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War. Later in the day, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said that the alleged execution of a &#xA0; Ukrainian soldier took place in the town of Novohrodivka in Donetsk Oblast. Ukrainian authorities have not yet established the time when the alleged execution took place. The investigation is ongoing to establish the circumstances and identify the people responsible for the crime. The pre-trial investigation is conducted by the Security Service of Ukraine&apos;s (SBU) investigators in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, according to the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. There have been multiple reports of Ukrainian POWs being tortured or killed while in Russian captivity since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. As of September, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said 28 criminal investigations were underway regarding the execution of 62 Ukrainian POWs. Russian forces attacked the city of Kharkiv with guided aerial bombs on Sept. 17, injuring at least seven people, local authorities reported. The city&apos;s Kyivskyi district came under attack, according to Mayor Ihor Terekhov. Four first responders are among the injured, he said. Sept. 17 marks Rescuer&apos;s Day in Ukraine. Another two civilian men, aged 19 and 25, also suffered injuries, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. In an interview with the Ukrainian media Interfax, the head of Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service Andrii Danyk said that as of July, 93 emergency workers were killed and almost 400 wounded since the beginning of the Russian full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-29/	2024-09-17T12:20:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2153450598-1.jpg
Trump assassination attempt suspect has no ties to Ukrainian institutions, Kyiv says	The suspect in the second assassination attempt on former President and Republican nominee Donald Trump has no ties to Ukrainian institutions, Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said at a briefing on Sept. 17. The U.S. Secret Service on Sept. 15 opened fire after seeing an armed individual at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, while Trump was playing golf. Trump was unharmed, and the FBI is investigating the incident as another assassination attempt against the Republican presidential candidate. The suspect detained in connection to the attack was identified as 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh. Based on his social media activity, Routh has cast himself as a supporter of Ukraine and spoke to the New York Times in 2023 about a scheme to recruit Afghan soldiers to fight for Kyiv. Tykhyi reiterated that the suspect has never fought for Ukraine as a member of the International Legion or other units of Ukraine&apos;s Defense Forces. &quot;We can see from the news reports that the suspect previously publicly supported Ukraine, but there are hundreds of millions of people in the United States who support Ukraine and clearly diverse groups of individuals,&quot; the spokesperson said. &quot;We urge everyone to refrain from artificially linking the suspect&apos;s actions to Ukraine.&quot; Following the incident, President Volodymyr Zelensky denounced the assassination attempt on Trump, saying that &quot;the rule of law is paramount and political violence has no place anywhere in the world.&quot; Trump was previously targeted in an assassination attempt on July 13 during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The incident sparked a wave of pro-Kremlin propaganda blaming Democrats for the plot against Trump. There are fears that Routh&apos;s apparent support for Ukraine will likely further inflame Russian disinformation narratives ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Multiple reports indicated that Russia would seek to interfere in the upcoming vote by backing Trump and turning the American public against supporting Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-assassination-attempt-suspect-has-no-ties-to-ukrainian-institutions-kyiv-says/	2024-09-17T12:11:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166117330.jpg
Trump Jr. urges Biden to negotiate with Moscow after Putin's nuclear saber-rattling	Donald Trump Jr. and former U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. opposed permitting Ukraine to strike Russian territory with Western-supplied long-range missiles, calling on the Biden-Harris administration to negotiate with Moscow. In a joint op-ed published by The Hill on Sept. 17, the two cited Russia&apos;s nuclear saber-rattling rhetoric and recent comment by Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying that lifting restrictions on long-range strikes would mean NATO being &quot;at war&quot; with Moscow. Russia has consistently issued threats, including nuclear ones, since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but none of them have materialized. Ukraine is hoping for permission to use two Western-supplied long-range missiles that it already possesses to strike military targets such as airfields located deep inside Russian territory. Anticipation had been high last week ahead of meetings between Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Washington, but no announcement on a decision was made. Trump Jr., the son of former President and Republican nominee Donald Trump, and Kennedy Jr., who suspended his presidential campaign this summer and endorsed Trump, claimed that lifting restrictions &quot;would put the world at greater risk of nuclear conflagration than at any time since the Cuban missile crisis.&quot; The two urged U.S. President Joe Biden and Democratic candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, to focus on &quot;finding a diplomatic off-ramp&quot; to Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Trump and Kennedy also rejected the threat of Moscow&apos;s attack on other European countries in the future, saying that Russia &quot;can barely wrest a few provinces from Ukraine.&quot; The opinion comes as President Volodymyr Zelensky is preparing to present his &quot;Victory Plan&quot; to Biden and other leaders later this month, which reportedly doesn&apos;t envisage a ceasefire or ceding territory to Moscow. &#xA0; Trump has repeatedly promised to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine within 24 hours if elected but has not publicly elaborated on how he plans to achieve that. During the presidential debate on Sept. 10, Harris pledged to support Ukraine while Trump refused to answer whether Ukraine&apos;s victory was in the best interests of the U.S., instead insisting that it was &quot;in the U.S.&apos;s best interest to get this war finished and just get it done. Negotiate a deal.&quot; Kyiv has said it aims to invite Russia for an upcoming second peace summit, though Moscow has shown no interest in accepting the invitation. Kyiv&apos;s 10-point peace formula includes a complete Russian withdrawal from the country. Russia named Ukraine giving up on occupied territory and ceding additional ground as conditions for talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-son/	2024-09-17T11:53:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2161883147.jpg
Russia claims Ukraine made new attempts to break into Kursk Oblast	The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Sept. 17 that it had repelled Ukraine&apos;s new attempts to cross into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast west of the currently controlled territories. Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in early August, reportedly seizing around 100 settlements and 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. The Ukrainian positions in the region are now threatened by a Russian counterattack launched last week. Commenting on Russia&apos;s counterattack, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that &quot;everything was going according to our plan&quot; and that Russia&apos;s &quot;rapid&quot; offensive had not yet achieved &quot;serious&quot; success in the area. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, Ukraine attempted to attack in the direction of the villages of Veseloye and Medvezhye, about 25 kilometers west of the currently-held territories in Kursk Oblast. Kyiv has not commented on these claims, which cannot be verified independently. One of the objectives of Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Kursk Oblast was to force Russia to redeploy its forces from the front in Ukraine. Before the Kursk operation, the most intense Russian assaults were observed in Donetsk Oblast, primarily near Pokrovsk. While the Russian offensive on Pokrovsk has slowed down after the launch of the Kursk incursion, heavy fighting continues in other sectors of the front in Donetsk Oblast, including near Vuhledar. Russia has also intensified its attacks on bordering Sumy Oblast, which the military considers to be a response to Kyiv&apos;s success in the Kursk operation. In addition to pushing Russian troops away from the border, Ukraine has reportedly taken over 600 Russian captives and inflicted 6,000 casualties in Russia&apos;s region as of early September.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-ukraine-made-new-attempts-to-break-into-kursk-oblast/	2024-09-17T09:55:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166312696.jpg

According to Zelensky, the plan is over 90% complete, and Kyiv is preparing to present it to allies next week. Ukraine is preparing for a second peace summit, following its first global peace summit in Switzerland in June where Russia was not invited. Kyiv has said it aims to invite a Russian representative to the second conference.	https://kyivindependent.com/none-of-ukraines-plans-to-end-the-war-envisages-ceasefire-ceding-territory-podolyak-says/	2024-09-17T08:23:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2164069605.jpg
Why Russia still rakes in cash transporting gas through Ukraine: What to know in 4 key charts	While Russia&apos;s deadly war rages on Ukraine&apos;s soil, one unexpected aspect of the invasion is that natural gas continues to flow through Ukraine from Russia, with both sides profiting from the deal and &#x2013; to an extent &#x2013; financing each other&apos;s war machines. That is expected to change when their deal expires at the end of the year. Russia has been paying Ukraine transport fees to carry its gas through thousands of kilometers of underground Ukrainian pipelines as part of a 2019 agreement between the two countries. Russia then rakes in billions of dollars of profits selling the gas to European partners. While Ukraine had the right to halt its gas deal by invoking a &#x201C;force majeure&#x201D; clause when the war broke out and deprive Russia of billions of dollars of funding for its war, doing so would have severely hurt Ukraine&#x2019;s allies and likely created a major energy crisis felt around the world. Instead, Ukraine has emphasized to its partners that it does not plan to renew the deal past its 2024 expiry, giving them time to find and negotiate alternative sources of energy. It is also working to secure a separate deal to use its pipeline network to bring gas to Europe from Azerbaijan. Many European countries have already sharply reduced their dependence on Russian gas because of the war, but the region still imports significant volumes of Russian gas to meet its energy needs. The gas agreement and its vulnerabilities again came to the forefront in the wake of Ukraine&#x2019;s invasion of Kursk &#x2013; the remaining border location where gas enters Ukraine from Russia and the site of a critical metering station. Both Russia and Ukraine make money off the deal &#x2013; though Russia&#x2019;s revenues from selling gas to Europe far outweigh Ukraine&#x2019;s income from the gas transport fees. Infographic showing the amounts of the EU&apos;s Russian gas that travels through Ukraine. (Lisa Kukharska / The Kyiv Independent)The former head of Ukraine&#x2019;s gas pipeline operator, GTS Operator, estimates that Russia earns around $5 billion a year from the deal, while Ukraine received $800 million in 2023. The former GTS Operator head, Serhii Makohon, added that the majority of this $800 million was spent on maintaining and operating the transit, leaving around $100-$200 million left in revenues for Ukraine&#x2019;s budget. Bloomberg has estimated Russia&#x2019;s revenues higher, at $6.5 billion dollars a year. The original agreement guaranteed $7 billion for Ukraine over 5 years, but Russia reduced its gas volumes and payments to Ukraine in 2022 after the invasion shut down one of the routes into Ukraine through occupied territory. Russia rebuffed Ukraine&#x2019;s offer to reroute the volumes through open pipelines. In response, Ukraine&#x2019;s state gas company opened up an arbitration case for late and insufficient payments. &#xA0;Ukraine did not say how much Russia had underpaid. European partners also benefit from the deal, receiving relatively cheaper Russian gas transported over land rather than by sea. Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine has roiled the natural gas markets, with key events causing large spikes in Europe&#x2019;s natural gas prices and contributing to rising living costs in Europe. Key events during Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine have shocked the European natural gas market. (Lisa Kukharska / The Kyiv Independent)Who buys the gas?Central and Western European countries have been relying on Russian natural gas for decades, with the recent Ukraine deal from 2019 only the latest in a series of agreements. The full-scale Russian invasion marked a turning point, forcing an unprecedented shift in Europe&#x2019;s energy policy. Europe is now &quot;fully committed&quot; to phasing out Russian gas, EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson said on Sept. 11, and is &quot;ready to live without this Russian gas coming from the Ukrainian transit route.&#x201D; With European countries taking steps to diversify their energy sources and reduce their dependence on Russia, the share of Russian gas among EU natural gas imports dropped from 45% in 2021 to 15% last year. Infographics of quarterly EU natural gas imports by source. Russian gas has dropped from 45% of EU imports to 15%. (Lisa Kukharska / The Kyiv Independent)The sharp drop in demand from European buyers has led to Russia&#x2019;s energy giant Gazprom posting its largest losses in 25 years &#x2013; with a $5.5 billion loss in the first half of 2024. While most European nations with maritime access have shifted to buying more liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports arriving by boat, landlocked countries in Central Europe, like Hungary, Slovakia, and Austria, face more challenges. Austria imports the highest share of Russian natural gas of any EU country, hitting a record of 98% in December 2023 and fluctuating above 80% in recent months. The country has pledged to eliminate Russian gas imports by 2027. Russian natural gas made up 82% and 85% of natural gas imports in Hungary and Slovakia in the first four months of 2024, respectively, according to a report from Fitch Ratings. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban&#x2019;s government, in contrast with the EU position, has defended the continued use of Russian gas, claiming stable Russian supplies are an economic imperative. European countries have also reduced their overall gas consumption. According to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, it has decreased by 20% since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. Despite these reductions, the EU still remains Russia&#x2019;s largest export market for natural gas. Some countries still have contracts with Russia to purchase their gas beyond 2024 and will need to break or find other ways to fulfill the contract, potentially importing Russian gas through the Turkstream route. Gas used to enter Ukraine from two points along the Russian border &#x2013; from the North through the metering station in Sudzha in Kursk Oblast, and from the East through the Sokhranivka metering station, near the border with Luhansk. Map of key gas pipelines from Russia to Europe. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, key gas pipeline routes have been shut down. (Lisa Kukharska / The Kyiv Independent)Because of the heavy fighting, shelling, and subsequent occupation in parts of Luhansk, Ukraine&#x2019;s gas operator, GTS Operator, has not been able to operate at the Sokhranivka entry point. It declared a force majeure event in May 2022, halting the flow of gas along that route and rerouting spare capacity through the Sudzha entry point in Kursk. At the time, about a third of gas from Russia to Europe flowed through the Sokhranivka route. &#xA0; Since then, the route through Kursk has been the only entryway into Ukraine across the Russian border. The Nord Stream pipeline, which delivered gas from Russia to Germany, used to carry the largest volumes of Russian gas to Europe of the pipelines. During the course of the war, Russia reduced volumes in transit by Nord Stream, eventually halting them altogether, claiming it was forced to do so in response to sanctions. Germany&#x2019;s largest gas importer, Uniper, was awarded billions in damages from Gazprom in arbitration in June for Russia&#x2019;s failure to deliver on its contracts. After volumes stopped pumping through the Nord Stream pipeline, saboteurs damaged the pipelines in 2022. German authorities issued an arrest warrant last month for a Ukrainian national in connection to the explosions of the Nord Stream pipelines, according to media reports. Kyiv has repeatedly denied connection to the Nord Stream blasts. The Polish section of another route for Russian gas &#x2013; the Yamal route &#x2013; was shut down in 2022 after Poland and Bulgaria refused Russia&#x2019;s demand to pay for the gas in rubles. Russia had wanted payment in rubles in response to Western sanctions imposed because of its invasion. The Ukraine pipelines may soon be filled with gas from Azerbaijan, replacing the Russian supplies. The Azeri gas would travel through southern Russia before reaching Ukraine. &#x201C;Naftogaz will not extend the transit agreement with Gazprom. We are not conducting negotiations and do not plan to,&#x201D; said Oleksii Chernyshov, the CEO of Naftogaz, Ukraine&#x2019;s national energy company, in a July interview with Liga.net. &quot;We are looking for alternative solutions. For example, we have been approached by businesses from Azerbaijan, particularly Socar. But we don&apos;t have a ready-made solution yet. It is too early to talk about it,&#x201D; Chernyshov said. On Sept. 6, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev confirmed that negotiations are underway with the EU, Moscow, and Kyiv about a potential deal. &#xA0; &#x201C;For several months we have been making great efforts to come to a common denominator,&#x201D; Aliyev said.	https://kyivindependent.com/why-russia-still-rakes-in-cash-transporting-gas-through-ukraine-what-to-know-in-4-key-charts/	2024-09-17T08:18:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/upd_GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
‘A wave of lawlessness’ – returning from war in Ukraine, Russian convicts commit crimes at home	Editor&#x2019;s note: This story contains graphic descriptions. Several months after Russian Sergei Kozlov, an assault fighter of the infamous Wagner Group, returned home from the war in Ukraine, he violently killed his 18-year-old partner Daria, who was pregnant with his child. She was beaten to death, suffering a traumatic brain injury, a broken nose, a liver rupture, and a closed abdominal injury &#x2013; the description of all 138 injuries took several pages in the case file, Russian state-controlled media outlet Kommersant reported on Sept. 4. On Sept. 9, the Russian Omsk Oblast Court convicted Kozlov of murder and sentenced him to 19 years behind bars. But this was not his first time in prison. In 2021, Kozlov was found guilty of severe and minor bodily harm and was supposed to serve 6.5 years in prison. But he was soon recruited by the Wagner mercenary group to join Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. For his combat achievements, Kozlov was even awarded the medal &quot;For Courage,&quot; Kommersant wrote. &#xA0; Moscow has been recruiting convicts for its war since the summer of 2022, first under the auspices of the Wagner Group and later under the Russian Defense Ministry. As of October 2023, Russia has reportedly recruited about 100,000 prisoners. Initially, prisoners, even those convicted of violent crimes, were promised a pardon after completing a six-month military contract. Since January, Russian army recruits drawn from prisons no longer receive pardons but are released on parole, and are expected to fight until the war is over. &#xA0; Russian POWs are seen living in a prisoner of war detention camp lining up for a meal in the cafeteria in the Lviv region, Ukraine, on Aug. 3, 2023. (Paula Bronstein /Getty Images)But as many of the convicts have already returned home under the previous conditions, reports of their new crimes appear to be increasing in Russia. Since the start of the year, Russia has seen a record number of grave crimes in the past 13 years &#x2014; more than 403,000 &#x2014; the Russian Verstka media outlet reported, citing the Russian Interior Ministry. &quot;Among the factors influencing the growth of crime, the Interior Ministry pointed to the war in Ukraine and the return of former prisoners from the front line,&quot; the outlet wrote. Over the past two years, at least 107 people have been killed, and another 100 have been seriously wounded by Russian war veterans returning from the front line in Ukraine, Verstka said in its investigation published in April. The majority of the victims were killed by ex-convicts, the outlet wrote. Mikhail Savva, a legal expert from the Center for Civil Liberties, believes that the current situation in Russia can be described as a &quot;wave of lawlessness&quot; and the &quot;degradation of legal culture.&quot; But the return of ex-convicts is not the only reason, Savva says. &quot;Aggression against an independent state is forbidden by international law. So many people in Russia understand that their government violates everything that can be violated,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Because it is precisely through the disregard for the law that people get the idea that anything is possible.&quot; &#xA0; The building of the Government of Moscow is seen with the illumination of &quot;Z,&quot; a symbol of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, after Earth Hour in Moscow, Russia, on March 26, 2022.

(Oleg Palchyk/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)According to Savva, the high number of crimes committed by convicts returning from the front line is mainly because Russia recruits prisoners convicted of nearly all types of crimes. Only those convicted of terrorism, extremism, and sexual crimes against minors are forbidden to be recruited, Savva says. However, most of the verdicts on extremist or terrorist charges in Russia are simply falsified, as the Kremlin uses them to imprison those protesting against its regime, he adds. &quot;Hence, murderers, serial killers, and others can join and stand under the Russian army flag.&quot; In May, the Moscow Times reported that Russian cannibal Dmitry Malyshev, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for murder and several other serious crimes, joined one of Russia&#x2019;s Storm V penal military units. Malyshev was reportedly recruited to the army together with serial killer Aleksandr Maslennikov, sentenced to 23 years in prison for the &quot;double murder and dismemberment of women.&quot; In late August, multiple Russian media outlets reported that a former Wagner mercenary, Ivan Rossomakhin, convicted of several crimes, had signed a contract with the Russian Defense Ministry and returned to the war in Ukraine. Rossomakhin was recruited by Wagner Group in September 2022 while he was serving a 14-year term for murder and theft. By the end of his military service, he was pardoned by Putin, according to Current Time, a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty project. Then in 2023, upon returning from the war in Ukraine, he raped and killed an 85-year-old woman. While serving his 23-year sentence, Rossomakhin reportedly joined the Russian army again.

Ukraine&apos;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said on Sept. 17 that he had appealed to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations in response to a photo that allegedly shows the execution of a Ukrainian prisoner of war with a sword. However, according to Savva, the rise in violence and brutality by Russian troops toward Ukrainians, including prisoners of war, is only partly due to the large number of convicts in their ranks. &quot;The reason is not that there are many convicts in the Russian army, but that the army is fighting in conditions where war crimes are the norm. In the Russian army, (war crimes) are not subject to punishment. They do not prohibit it,&quot; Savva says. In May, Ukraine also began allowing convicts to enlist in the army. However, the eligibility requirements for these prisoners are more stringent compared to those in Russia. Those serving for premeditated murder, the murder of two or more people, sexual violence, drug production, and crimes against national security are not eligible to enlist. &quot;There are limitations based on the severity of the crimes,&quot; Savva says. &quot;In Ukraine, for instance, serial killers remain in prisons, unlike Russia.&quot; He says the whole recruitment process is different, too. Russia does it &quot;en masse,&quot; and most of the convicts have joined the Storm V penal military units. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, different brigades recruit prisoners to fight alongside their other soldiers, which also helps their socialization, Savva says. While Ukraine has said it&apos;s looking to recruit a total of 20,000 convicts, over 10,000 convicts signed up in Russia last April alone, the U.K. Defense Ministry reported. &quot;What we are witnessing now in the Russian army is the degradation of it as an institution of order,&quot; Savva says.

Russian attack injures 4 first responders in Kharkiv, as Ukraine marks Rescuer's Day	Russian forces attacked the city of Kharkiv with guided aerial bombs on Sept. 17, injuring at least six people, local authorities reported. The city&apos;s Kyivskyi district came under attack, according to Mayor Ihor Terekhov. Four first responders are among the injured, he said. Sept. 17 marks Rescuer&apos;s Day in Ukraine. Another two civilian men, aged 19 and 25, also suffered injuries, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. In an interview with the Ukrainian media Interfax, the head of Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service Andrii Danyk said that as of July, 93 emergency workers were killed and almost 400 wounded since the beginning of the Russian full-scale invasion. Attacks against population centers in Kharkiv Oblast intensified after Russia launched a new cross-border offensive in the northern part of the region in May. While the push has been halted by Ukrainian troops, Russian troops continue to hold a handful of settlements just across the border. In one of the recent attacks, Russian forces hit an apartment building in Kharkiv on Sept. 15, killing a 94-year-old woman and injuring over 40 people.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-injures-4-first-responders-in-kharkiv-as-ukraine-marks-rescuers-day/	2024-09-17T06:43:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1233096956.jpg
Too dangerous to ignore' – Russia's malicious activity in the Baltics set to test NATO resolve	&#x201C;Russian intelligence is everywhere. And its propaganda is everywhere, not only in Estonia but all over the world,&#x201D; Estonian President Alar Karis told the Kyiv Independent during an interview on the sidelines of the 20th annual Yalta European Strategy (YES) Conference in Kyiv. Russia has been actively meddling in the domestic affairs of the Baltic states. An Estonian professor was arrested by the Estonian Internal Security Service (ISS or Kapo) in January 2024 on suspicion of being a Russian spy and later sentenced to six years in prison. Meanwhile, Moscow has also been ratcheting up tensions in the Baltic Sea. GPS jamming, disappearing buoys and an aborted &quot;ocean-grab&quot; are just some of the recent events that are raising concerns about the Kremlin&apos;s intentions in the region. &quot;Things are coming to the surface again in a very dramatic way at the moment,&quot; Elisabeth Braw, a Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council, tells the Kyiv Independent. A draft decree posted on the Kremlin&apos;s website on May 21 declared Russia would be unilaterally redrawing the maritime border with Lithuania and Finland in the Baltic Sea. Then, as quickly as it appeared, the draft decree vanished on May 22. There has been no public explanation from the Kremlin as to why it was taken down, but Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis described it as &quot;an obvious escalation against NATO and the EU.&quot; The map of the Baltic Sea region. (The Kyiv Independent)A day after the draft decree disappeared, so did buoys on the Narva River which mark the separation of Russian and Estonian territory. Both countries agreed on the buoys&apos; location in 2022, but the Kremlin then backtracked and disputed the placement of more than half of the 250 markers, which Russian border guards unilaterally began removing on May 23 without providing an explanation. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas described it as a &quot;border incident&quot; and said it was being investigated. &#x201C;You see quite a lot of change in the Baltics. We are trying to convince our people to spend more on defense, to build up factories, to cooperate more with Ukraine, and to learn everything that we can because we feel that if Ukraine is unable to stop the Russians, then the Russians will not stop, and then who knows what will happen next,&#x201D; Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told the Kyiv Independent in an exclusive interview. The Latvian defense minister shared a similar concern. &quot;We are in a hybrid conflict right now,&quot; Latvian Defense Minister Andris Spruds told the Kyiv Independent on Aug. 23. &quot;Unfortunately, this is the neighbor we are facing,&quot; he added. Russia has been suspected of intentionally jamming the GPS systems aboard commercial aircraft for more than a decade, but incidents over the Baltic Sea region have skyrocketed in recent months. According to a report by The Sun in April based on data from the website GPSJAM.org, some 46,000 aircraft have reported problems over the Baltic Sea since the previous August, with most of them occurring in Eastern Europe near borders with Russia. Some incidents have resulted in aircraft having to turn around mid-flight, and even a plane carrying the U.K. defense secretary has been targeted. Describing the phenomenon earlier this year, Landsbergis said it was &quot;getting too dangerous to ignore.&quot; While it&apos;s almost impossible to definitively prove who is responsible for the GPS jamming, a jammer blocks a signal from the point where it is deployed up to a distance of 350 kilometers for some military-grade models. This photograph shows a boat in the Baltic sea on a surveillance camera of the French navy patrol airplane Atlantique 2 on mission above the Baltic Sea on June 16, 2022. (Fred Tanneau / AFP via Getty Images)This means in order to block GPS signals over the Baltic Sea, the jammer would have to be located in one of the countries surrounding it. Unless NATO countries are engaging in self-sabotage, this leaves one obvious candidate &#x2013; Russia. The Baltic states have also been actively countering a variety of other attacks, including cyber. &#x201C;We have been prepared for cyber-attacks for quite a long time because they started in 2007. We also start to convince also Western parties that this is a very important issue,&#x201D; President Karis told the Kyiv Independent. Back in May, an ominous warning was issued by NATO&apos;s newest member, Sweden. Micael Byden, the supreme commander of the Swedish Armed Forces, said Putin may be seeking dominance over the Baltic Sea and has his eye on the Swedish island of Gotland. Located around 330 kilometers (around 200 miles) north of the Russian exclave Kaliningrad, Gotland is Sweden&apos;s largest island, and its central location means it is of vital strategic importance in the Baltic Sea. &quot;Who controls Gotland controls the Baltic Sea,&quot; said Byden. NATO military exercises in the Black Sea in June were another reminder of how much things have changed in a short time. Twenty NATO member states, including the recently added Sweden and Finland, put forward 9,000 troops, 50 ships, and 45 aircraft to take part in the drills. As well as having direct access to the Baltic Sea through its most eastern arm in the Finnish Gulf, Russia also has the exclave of Kaliningrad, a small piece of land sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. Russia&apos;s Baltic Sea Fleet has its headquarters and main base in Kaliningrad, with another base in Baltiysk. Western analysts have described the size and power of the Baltic Sea Fleet as &quot;somewhat limited,&quot; and when Russia conducted military exercises in the Baltic Sea in August 2023, around 30 warships and boats were set to take part, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. But that&apos;s not all Russia possesses in Kaliningrad. &quot;Kaliningrad is essentially a Russian weapons depot, and it has a lot of militarily operational equipment in use, not just in storage,&quot; Braw said. According to a December 2023 article by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Russia has amassed a &quot;formidable&quot; arsenal of weapons in the exclave in recent years that includes &quot;cruise missiles, surface-to-air missiles, and nuclear weapons.&quot; Without a direct line to the Kremlin, it&apos;s impossible to know for certain, and expert opinion varies from an escalating hybrid war to an outright intention to invade the Baltic states &#x2013; Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The top officials from all three states are well aware of such a possibility. &#x201C;When we add up the number of troops, missiles, tanks, and money, Russia is nowhere near the power that it was during the Soviet Union when it could match NATO,&#x201D; Landsbergis told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;In real military scenarios, it&apos;s incomparable. NATO could overwhelm Russia.&#x201D; &#x201C;But the Russians are not counting on that. They are counting on &#x2013; how they explain it to themselves &#x2013; &#xA0;democratic weakness, inability to make decisions, differences in opinions,&#x201D; he added. Throughout 2024, Western and NATO officials have been sounding the alarm on Russia&apos;s expansionist ambitions beyond Ukraine. Denmark&apos;s Defence Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, said on Feb. 9 Russia could attack a NATO country &quot;within a three&#x2013;to five-year period.&quot; A top German general a day later said Germany should be prepared for a war with Russia within the next five years. And a senior Estonian official told the Financial Times (FT) in the same month that Russia&#x2019;s &quot;intent and capability&#x201D; to attack a NATO country before the end of the decade was &quot;pretty much consensus&quot; within the military alliance. If accurate, a simple matter of geography puts the Baltic states in the crosshairs of these future scenarios.

(Narciso Contreras/Anadolu via Getty Images)While on paper, NATO is far more powerful than Russia, Dr. Jan Kallberg, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, Washington D.C., and a fellow at the Army Cyber Institute at West Point, said the Kremlin could be relying on an inefficient and incoherent response from the military bloc to offset this. &quot;They maybe think the Western leadership isn&apos;t tough enough to stand up when things really hit the fan,&quot; he tells the Kyiv Independent, adding: &quot;They might think that they can act quickly and the West won&apos;t have the time to do force generation in the area and they can, with little means, just capture the Baltics and the West faces a fait accompli.&#x201D; &quot;Their bet is that the Western leadership would cave in,&quot; Kallberg said. Two days after Kallberg spoke to the Kyiv Independent, a Russian think tank with a large influence on Kremlin policy said Moscow should consider a &quot;demonstrative&quot; nuclear explosion to dissuade the West from allowing its weapons to be used to strike inside Russia. Such a nuclear scenario is, according to some Western officials, already enough to worry the U.S. to the point where Washington has taken preemptive steps to prevent it. &#x201C;Russia knows very well that it&apos;s not the only nuclear power in Europe and in the world. I don&apos;t think we are going to test a nuclear attack on any country,&#x201D; President Karis said, however. Latvian Foreign Minister Spruds is also measured in his assessment, saying that for Latvia and the other Baltic states, it&apos;s &quot;nothing new for us.&quot; &quot;For us, there is no need to panic because we&apos;ve been used to hybrid activities already for years,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;It&apos;s cyber attacks, it&apos;s weaponization of illegal migration, it&apos;s disinformation campaigns, it&apos;s some incidents against critical infrastructure. &quot;So we&apos;ve seen it, and we are experiencing it permanently.&quot; As alarming as the prospect of further Russian invasions, naval assaults, and &quot;demonstrative&quot; nuclear explosions are, Braw cautions against getting too wrapped up in looking for outright signs of military aggression. &quot;Frankly, I don&apos;t think taking over the Baltic states is Russia&apos;s first objective,&quot; she said. &quot;If you invade a country, if you break it, you own it &#x2013; and occupying and administering occupied territory is extremely cumbersome, as Russia is seeing in Ukraine. I think weakening them, destabilizing them, and making them in many ways failed states is more what Russia wants,&#x201D; Braw added. Braw points to things like GPS jamming forcing and the mysterious disappearing decrees on maritime borders as actions designed to waste the time and resources of the Baltic governments and &quot;making them uncertain about what&apos;s next.&quot; A Russian naval ship takes part in the rehearsal of the Naval Parade in the morning in St. Petersburg in the Gulf of Finland on July 21, 2024. (Artem Priakhin/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)&quot;And this is intended to create a sense of paranoia and inferiority where you eventually say, &apos;we just have to live with a great deal of Russian influence in the region,&#x2019;&quot; she added. Braw also points out that there is little NATO can do about such things as it&apos;s only set up to respond to overt military aggression. &quot;The Russians have been imaginative before, this is what they&apos;re good at,&quot; she said. &quot;They think of different ways of harming other countries, achieving their goals, and they do it underneath the threshold of Article 5, which means the affected countries struggle to respond.&#x201D; Kallberg agrees that if the situation in the Baltic Sea escalates further, whatever comes next won&apos;t be an outright declaration of war but something designed to test NATO&apos;s response. &#x201C;For us, it&apos;s very important to keep this transatlantic bond. As far as defense (goes), the U.S. should be number one (leading) in this case,&#x201D; President Karis said.	https://kyivindependent.com/too-dangerous-to-ignore-russias-malicious-activity-in-the-baltics-set-to-test-nato-resolve/	2024-09-17T06:39:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2162291001.jpg
Ukraine destroys Russian ammunition depots near occupied Mariupol, Navy says	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. The Ukrainian Navy recently carried out a missile strike on ammunition depots near the Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Mariupol, according to a Sept. 17 statement. The strike destroyed both the storage infrastructure and tons of ammunition that Russian troops were stockpiling for use against Ukraine, the Navy said. Mariupol came under siege by Russian forces between February and May 2022, leaving thousands dead and reducing Mariupol to rubble. According to authorities&apos; rough estimates, at least 25,000 people may have been killed during the siege of Mariupol. The exact number remains unknown and could be much higher.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-destroys-russian-ammunition-depots-near-russian-occupied-mariupol/	2024-09-17T06:05:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-17-at-15_49_47.png
Brazil cannot take part in Russia-Ukraine war,' Lula says after Zelensky's criticism	Brazil cannot interfere in the Russian-Ukrainian war, and those who want to engage in a dialogue with the Brazilian government should have done so before the war, Brazil&apos;s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Sept. 16, Metropoles reported. The South American country has positioned itself as neutral in the war, refusing to join sanctions or provide military aid while proposing a peace initiative in cooperation with China. President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized Brazil&apos;s and China&apos;s joint plan, calling it &quot;destructive.&quot; &quot;You either support the war, or you don&apos;t support the war. If you don&apos;t support it, then help us stop Russia,&quot; Zelensky said. The president added that he offered to discuss peace proposals with Chinese and Brazilian leaders. Lula gave a speech during the graduation ceremony for diplomats at the Rio Branco Institute and, without explicitly mentioning Zelensky&apos;s recent statement, said that &quot;those who want to talk to us now could have done so before the war started.&quot; &quot;Brazil has never been so important in the world as now. It&apos;s not just because of agriculture business, it&apos;s not just because of iron ore, it&apos;s not just because of soy or meat. It&apos;s because Brazil is an unbeatable country when it comes to energy,&quot; Lula said. &quot;That&apos;s why it&apos;s important for Brazil not to take part in the war in Ukraine and Russia, that&apos;s why it&apos;s important for Brazil to say that we want peace, we don&apos;t want war. Those who want to talk to us now could have talked to us before the war started,&quot; he added. At the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Brazil&apos;s president was a far-right politician and Lula&apos;s rival, Jair Bolsonaro. Lula took office in January 2023, when the all-out war had already lasted for almost a year. Prior to that, Lula was head of the Brazilian state from 2003 until 2011, three years before Russia&apos;s illegal annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the partial occupation of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts by Russian forces. In May, Brazil and China pitched a six-point peace plan that called on both Russia and Ukraine to avoid &quot;escalation of hostilities&quot; and &quot;provocations.&quot; It came as a parallel plan to Ukraine&apos;s peace efforts based on Zelensky&apos;s 10-point peace formula, which included a global peace summit in Switzerland in June. China did not attend the summit despite the invitation, while the Brazilian representative who was present did not sign the resulting communique. The six-point plan from Brazil and China calls for: Moscow has previously said it would accept Brazil and China as intermediaries for possible peace talks. While the two countries refused to publicly take sides in the war, China served as Russia&apos;s key economic lifeline and a source of dual-use goods. There have been no direct negotiations between Ukraine and Russia since early 2022. Moscow named Ukraine giving up on occupied territory and ceding additional ground as conditions for talks. In turn, Kyiv&apos;s 10-point peace formula includes a complete Russian withdrawal from the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/brazil-cannot-interfere-in-russia-ukraine-war-lula-says-after-zelenskys-criticism/	2024-09-17T05:59:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170682594.jpg
Ukraine's parliament backs major tax hike in first reading	Ukraine&apos;s parliament approved on Sept. 17 a bill that proposes a tax increase of Hr 58 billion ($1.4 billion) in 2024 and Hr 137 billion ($3.3 billion) in 2025. The draft law was introduced to the parliament as the country struggles to shore up its budget deficit amid Russia&apos;s ongoing full-scale war. The bill would increase the military tax from 1.5% to 5%, set higher taxes for self-employed persons, impose a 50% tax on bank profits in 2024, and 25% tax on the profits of other financial institutions. The parliament failed to gather enough votes to pass the initial version of the bill on Sept. 3, which was meant to bring an additional Hr 30 billion ($720 million) to the state budget. Only after the revision by the parliamentary tax committee did enough lawmakers &#x2013; 241 &#x2013; support the bill. Before becoming law, the legislation must pass a second reading and be signed by the president. After passing, the law will have to be antedated to Oct. 1 as it is unlikely to be approved until later in October, lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said in August that Ukraine faces a budget deficit of $35 billion next year, though foreign partners have pledged to cover roughly $20 billion of that sum. Kyiv has grown increasingly reliant on external sources of financing, such as grants and loans from the EU, the U.S., the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and other partners as Russia&apos;s war continues to put heavy strain on the country&apos;s economy. The proposed tax increase is part of an effort to find additional sources of funding at home, which may also include increased domestic borrowing and measures to boost the number of jobs and wages. Despite the dire budgetary situation, the bill has received criticism due to its potential repercussions on already difficult living conditions in the country. The ZN.ua media outlet conducted a survey in July that showed that around 32% of Ukrainian families have enough money only to buy food, while 9% said they even struggle to buy groceries. The population&apos;s economic hardships are further compounded by the physical danger of Russian attacks and blackouts caused by Russia&apos;s drone and missile campaign against energy infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-parliament-backs-major-tax-hike-in-first-reading/	2024-09-17T05:36:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1245855806.webp
Von der Leyen names new European Commission with pro-Ukraine figures leading diplomacy, defense	European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen officially announced on Sept. 17 the composition of the EU&apos;s executive arm as the bloc seeks to better respond to Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine and other global challenges. Von der Leyen, winning her second five-year term in the June elections, has proven to be a vocal supporter of Ukraine during the full-scale war, which is reflected in her picks for key Brussels jobs. For the first time in history, the European Commission will include the position of defense commissioner. Former Lithuanian Prime Minister and Member of the European Parliament Andrius Kubilius will take up the new post overseeing the EU&apos;s defense policy. Von der Leyen said the commissioner will &quot;work on developing the European defense union and boosting our investment in industrial capacity.&quot; Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine revealed serious deficiencies in the European defense industry as EU countries struggled to provide Kyiv with sufficient arms and munitions. Croatian MEP (Group of the European People&apos;s Party (Christian Democrats) - Hrvatska demokratska zajednica) Dubravka Suica (L) and the Lithuanian Member of the European Parliament (Group of the European People&apos;s Party (Christian Democrats) - Tvyns sjunga-Lietuvos krikionys demokratai) Andrius Kubilius (R) are listening during the hearing of the European Commissioner-designate for neighborhood and enlargement policy, Oliver Varhelyi while he is answering questions during his hearing at the European Parliament on Nov. 14, 2019, in Brussels, Belgium. ( Thierry Monasse/Getty ImagesKubilius, who headed Lithuania&apos;s government between 1999-2000 and then again between 2008-2012, has been an outspoken supporter of Kyiv&apos;s struggle against Moscow. Speaking to the European Parliament on Sept. 17, Kubilius said that the EU needs &quot;to radically ramp up production of our military industry and to integrate Ukraine&apos;s military industry with the European one.&quot; &quot;And we need to remove any red lines in the defense of Ukraine,&quot; he added. One of the most senior positions in the commission, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, was given to former Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas. The Estonian politician will replace Josep Borrell, who headed the EU&apos;s diplomacy since 2019. Kallas&apos;s appointment was long expected after she stepped down from the Estonian government in July. Leading the Baltic country at the Russian border from 2021 until 2024, Kallas advocated for more decisive measures by the West to help Ukraine fend off Russia&apos;s aggression.

(Leon Neal/Getty Images)Under her leadership, Estonia has been among the leaders in the Ukraine aid in terms of GDP per capita. Kallas also argued for Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO and supported Paris&apos;s proposal of deploying Western military trainers on the ground. Another appointment that will be crucial for Ukraine is Slovenia&apos;s Marta Kos, who was nominated to replace Hungarian Oliver Varhelyi as the enlargement commissioner. Kos will be responsible for the EU&apos;s Eastern neighborhood policy and &quot;will work on supporting Ukraine &#x2013; and continuing the work on reconstruction, and support candidate countries to prepare them for accession,&quot; von der Leyen said. Kos, whose final appointment is still awaiting a non-binding decision by the national parliament, previously served as ambassador to Switzerland and Germany. Experts told the Kyiv Independent in June that a potential replacement of the Hungarian commissioner, whose homeland has repeatedly obstructed Kyiv&apos;s membership efforts, could signal a more positive outlook for Ukraine&apos;s accession. Varhelyi remains in the EU&apos;s executive as the health and animal welfare commissioner.

Russia striking Sumy Oblast due to Kyiv's successes in Kursk incursion, Ukraine's military says	The Russian military is striking Sumy Oblast because of Ukraine&apos;s successes in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Vadym Mysnyk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Operational Tactical Group Siversk, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on Sept. 17. The statement came after Russia launched a heavy drone attack on the northeastern Ukrainian region, disrupting electricity and water supplies. Russian attacks against Sumy Oblast have escalated since Kyiv launched a cross-border incursion into the neighboring Kursk Oblast in early August. Mysnyk nevertheless said that Russian strikes on Sumy Oblast would have continued even if Ukraine had not successfully advanced in the Kursk sector. While Russia has ramped up attacks against the region since August, Sumy Oblast has been shelled on a daily basis since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in 2022. &quot;It&apos;s just a matter of time before they dump all this (all the weapons) on us. Either here (in Sumy Oblast) or in another city. But they will strike at Ukraine with everything they have, using the entire arsenal,&quot; the spokesperson said. &quot;They (Russia) see our successes in the Kursk operation &#x2013; and we are close to them &#x2013; so there is probably some fear that we will somehow operate in other cities on the border,&quot; he added. Mysnyk also noted that the Russian military had reduced the number of mortar attacks on the border of Sumy Oblast and stopped attacking Kharkiv Oblast with aerial guided bombs. This may indicate that Russia&apos;s resources are &quot;not unlimited,&quot; he added. Russia recently launched a counterattack in Kursk Oblast, seeking to dislodge Ukrainian troops from its soil. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that &quot;everything was going according to our plan&quot; and that the Russian &quot;rapid&quot; offensive had not yet achieved &quot;serious&quot; success in the area. Ukrainian soldiers also have reportedly taken over 600 Russian captives and inflicted 6,000 casualties in Kursk Oblast as of early September.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-attacks-sumy-oblast/	2024-09-17T04:03:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167241400.jpg
‘It’s personal’ — Why Germany still refuses to send Taurus missiles to Ukraine	While Washington and London are facing pressure to allow Ukraine to strike targets deep inside Russia using the Western-made missiles already in the country, Berlin declines to even provide such missiles. &#x201C;Germany has made a clear decision about what we will do and what we will not do. This decision will not change,&#x201D; Scholz said on Sept. 13, remaining adamant in his refusal to provide the country&#x2019;s Taurus long-range missiles to Ukraine. His remarks came after U.S. President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stopped short of lifting restrictions on using Western-supplied long-range weapons on Russian soil during their meeting in Washington. In the spring, Washington confirmed that it had begun providing Ukraine with long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS). Kyiv had previously received missiles that could travel up to 160 kilometers, and the new batch consisted of advanced ones with a range of up to 300 kilometers. But Berlin&apos;s transfer of Taurus missiles did not follow. Prior, Germany followed the U.S. lead in handing over the first Patriot air defense system in early 2023 and the long-anticipated battle tanks. When Kyiv launched a surprise incursion into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, the operation received endorsement from Berlin. Germany&#x2019;s Defense Ministry said Ukraine is &#x201C;free to choose&#x201D; the weapons to use inside Russia for self-defense in compliance with international law. Yet, Berlin continues to hold off Ukrainian requests to provide the last piece of the puzzle, the missiles that can target the Russian military in the rear. A TAURUS (Target Adaptive Unitary and dispenser Robotic Ubiquity System) KEPD 350 air-launched cruise missile is on display during the press presentation at the International Aerospace Exhibition (ILA) in Schoenefeld, near Berlin, Germany, on June 3, 2024. (Ralf Hirschberger /AFP via Getty Images)&#xA0;&quot;A nightmare scenario for Scholz is that Ukraine would use Taurus to strike politically sensitive targets inside Russia. Scholz fears that this could escalate the war and throw Germany into direct hostilities with Russia,&quot; Fabian Hoffmann, doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo, who specializes in missile technology, told the Kyiv Independent earlier this spring. &#x201C;Fundamentally, this means that Scholz is restrained by a lack of political will, which stems from a lack of trust in Ukrainian leadership to not break any promises.&#x201D; President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested that Germany&#x2019;s refusal to provide Ukraine with long-range missiles is linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s nuclear saber-rattling. &#x201C;As I understand it, the chancellor says that Germany is not a nuclear state and that this (Taurus missiles) is the most powerful weapon system in Germany,&#x201D; Ukraine&#x2019;s president said in an interview with Bild. In his recent comments, Putin claimed that giving Ukraine the green light to use long-range weapons against targets inside Russia would mean NATO was &quot;at war&quot; with Moscow. Russia has been constantly issuing threats that have failed to materialize. Designed to hit buried and protected targets, such as command posts and bridges, the Taurus cruise missile can hit targets 500 kilometers away, outmatching the capabilities of other Western long-range systems that Ukraine has in service. Apart from ATACMS, Ukraine received the British Storm Shadow missiles, along with the French equivalent, the SCALP missiles, which have a range of up to 250 kilometers. The arsenal helped Ukraine hit Russian targets in the occupied territories, including Crimea.

(Attila Husejnow/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Kyiv has repeatedly promised it would not attack Russian territory with long-range weapons provided by Western allies without official approval. Berlin seems to not care. Among the reasons Scholz gave for not providing Ukraine with long-range missiles was the alleged inability to use them without the German soldiers&apos; involvement, which was refuted. &#x201C;At this point, it has even become what you might call a personal issue of the chancellor,&#x201D; Jessica Berlin, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), said. &#x201C;There&apos;s a personal element involved in the other political considerations. That is not the only driver of the decision, but is certainly playing a role.&#x201D; According to a German general, who was not authorized to speak to the press, providing the Taurus missiles to Ukraine is solely a political decision, and the German Armed Forces don&apos;t object to the decision being made. A year before the German parliamentary elections, the majority of Germans support Scholz&apos;s decision not to provide Ukraine with Taurus missiles. An April poll by Forsa Institute, requested by the German RTL television channel, showed that only 37% of Germans back the Taurus deliveries to Kyiv, while 56% oppose such a move. At the same time, according to a February poll by the ZDF TV channel, 62% of Germans favor European countries providing Kyiv with more weapons and ammunition, while 32% oppose it. Jessica Berlin said that German support for the provision of Taurus has been slipping in the polls, partly due to a lack of decisiveness, clarity, and political leadership. This creates a ripe environment for Russian propaganda and narratives around &#x201C;escalation,&#x201D; for which there is no German strategy to counter effectively, according to the expert. &#x201C;If the German public understood fully the nature of the situation and the nature of the threat we face from Russia, they would be less fearful of helping Ukraine&apos;s self-defense with German hardware, and they would understand that investing in Ukraine&apos;s defense is also investing in Germany&apos;s defense.&#x201D; Christian M&#xF6;lling, a security expert at the Germany-based Bertelsmann Foundation, told the Kyiv Independent that &#x201C;people basically have given up on arguing for Taurus.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-wont-send-taurus-missiles-to-ukraine-scholz-says-why/	2024-09-17T04:03:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2171104834.jpg
Around 1 million killed, wounded in Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine, WSJ reports	Roughly 1 million Ukrainians and Russians have been killed or wounded in Moscow&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Sept. 17, citing undisclosed sources and Western intelligence estimates. Kyiv and Moscow have mostly avoided commenting on the casualties their forces suffered during the war, which has been ongoing for two and half years. A &quot;confidential Ukrainian estimate from earlier this year&quot; put Kyiv&apos;s losses at 80,000 soldiers killed and 400,000 wounded, the WSJ wrote, citing undisclosed sources. President Volodymyr Zelensky presented a much lower number of military fatalities in February - 31,000. He did not reveal the number of wounded troops. Western intelligence estimates cited by the WSJ placed Russian losses at up to 200,000 dead and 400,000 wounded. This is close to Kyiv&apos;s estimates on Moscow&apos;s casualties, which is over 635,000 killed and wounded as of Sept. 17. Leaking Pentagon documents reported on by The Economist in July suggest that Russian losses could be even more serious, with the highest estimate being 728,000 troops killed, injured, or captured. Moscow has not disclosed its casualties during the war. The last figure provided by Russian authorities was 5,937 killed soldiers as of September 2022. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Both Ukraine and Russia have sought to replenish the ranks of their militaries as there appears to be no end of the war in sight. Kyiv adopted new legislation on mobilization in the spring, lowering the conscription age from 27 to 25 and imposing stricter penalties for dodging draft. In turn, Russia carried out a partial mobilization in September 2022 and, according to Ukraine&apos;s intelligence, continues &quot;covertly&quot; drafting roughly 30,000 troops every month. Moscow primarily targets residents of economically weaker regions and migrants rather than men from wealthy urban centers to avoid discontent and an economic downturn. The war brought a demographic shock to both countries, already struggling with population growth. An estimated 14 million Ukrainians have been displaced by the war, including nearly 6.5 million who fled or were forced out abroad. Around 650,000 Russians have permanently relocated abroad since the start of the invasion in 2022, motivated by fears of draft or opposition to the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/wsj-ukraine-russia-losses/	2024-09-17T03:06:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1474875794.jpg
Germany pledges over $110 million in winter aid for Ukraine	Germany will provide an additional 100 million euros ($111 million) in aid to Ukraine this winter, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock announced during a visit to Moldova on Sept. 17, Reuters reported.Russia is once again planning a 'winter war with the aim of making the lives of people in Ukraine as terrible as possible,' Baerbock said before a ministerial conference in Chisinau.Ukrainians have been living with intermittent power outages throughout the summer and autumn since Russia stepped up its campaign of strikes against energy infrastructure.Serhiy Kovalenko, the CEO of energy supplier Yasno, warned in June that Ukrainians may have electricity for just 6-7 hours per day in the winter, depending on how much of the grid can be repaired.Ahead of the coming winter, Ukraine has ensured that 85% of its energy infrastructure is protected against further Russian attacks, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Sept. 10.Shmyhal said it is impossible to predict how many hours of blackouts Ukrainians will endure during the winter.According to the prime minister, the Ukrainian government has allocated Hr 19 billion ($461 million) for the protection of energy facilities, and another Hr 13 billion ($315 million) has been provided by foreign partners.'A near-death feeling:' Largest-yet Russian attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure brings back widespread power outagesViktoriia Skyba, a 29-year-old mother of two, didn't have the time to reach a bomb shelter when Russia attacked her town during what Ukrainian officials have said is the largest attack on Ukraine since the full-scale invasion.

Syrians disappear in Luhansk Oblast' — Ukraine's intelligence says Moscow uses foreign fighters as cannon fodder	Russia is luring men from Syria to use them as cannon fodder in battles in Ukraine's east, the Ukrainian military intelligence agency (HUR) said on Sept. 17.Throughout the full-scale war, Moscow has been using various schemes to enlist migrants and foreign nationals to offset the heavy losses it had suffered during the invasion while avoiding full mobilization.Syria, a country ravaged by civil war and largely ruled by the Kremlin's ally Bashar al-Assad, is one of the key targets of these efforts.'Russia has established a scheme with travel companies to recruit Syrians for the war against Ukraine. First, poor people are offered jobs as security guards in Russian oil regions, and then they are lured with a higher salary' to fight the war against Ukraine, HUR said on social media. Syrian nationals are also promised Russian passports. Сирійці зникають на Луганщині ― росіяни посилають іноземних найманців у м'ясні штурми  Держава-агресор росія продовжує практики 'жуковщини', використовуючи іноземних найманців у війні проти України як гарматне м'ясо.  https://t.co/uvrnjzrugJ pic.twitter.com/vHRijUaj1y— Defence intelligence of Ukraine (@DI_Ukraine) September 17, 2024 Syrian mercenaries are then reportedly used as cannon fodder in mass infantry attacks and are being rejected evacuation when wounded. As an example, HUR presented the stories of Mohammed Mansour and Wahid Mursal Al-Shibli, two Syrian mercenaries fighting for Russia.As part of a squad of 14 other Syrians, Mansur was deployed in an attack near Svatove in Luhansk Oblast in July. After coming under Ukrainian fire, Russia rejected the mercenaries' request for evacuation and ordered them to press the attack, HUR said.Mansur allegedly refused to obey the order and fled the battlefield, while the rest of his unit dispersed and is now considered missing.Al-Shibli was deployed in Luhansk Oblast as a member of a seven-member squad. He was injured in battle and died as he was not evacuated, HUR caimed.The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify all the claims.Some third-party countries have taken steps to prevent their citizens from dying on Ukrainian battlefields. India has reached a deal with Moscow to dischrage its nationals from the Russian Armed Forces, while Nepal stopped issuing work permits for Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/hur-syrians/	2024-09-17T01:55:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1239490221.jpg
Opinion: IMF's trip to Moscow is effectively enabling Russia's war against Ukraine	You probably haven't heard that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is preparing to send a mission to Russia. That's because top IMF officials have been trying to draw as little public attention to their plans as possible - which ought to tell you something. Fund officials themselves know that this is a scandal in the making.The IMF is about to send its first official mission to Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.The visit later this month, which is to be led by Deputy Head of Division Jacques Miniane, marks a quiet but significant shift in the Fund's approach toward Russia. Western nations previously pressured the IMF to drop the idea of sending missions in 2022 and 2023. Now, the IMF is reengaging with Moscow, despite Russia's continued war in Ukraine.This decision is a big diplomatic win for the Kremlin, even if the IMF is acting as though it's business as usual. The Fund has tried to keep the mission low profile: we know about it mainly because of an incidental remark made to Reuters by the head of the IMF's Russia department.A terse IMF press release went largely unnoticed by the media.The IMF claims to be outside politics, but its actions show a blatant disregard for international law and human rights. The invasion of Ukraine isn't a matter of policy debate—it's a crime. By engaging with Moscow now, the IMF sends a message that Russian actions can be overlooked.This isn't neutrality; it's complicity.Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and the IMF leadership are detached from the brutal realities of the ongoing war. They are focused on a vision for a postwar order in which peace and stability prevail. But this vision is built on arrogance—the belief that Fund bureaucrats understand the future better than anyone else.In reality, by attempting to move toward normalization, they strengthen Russia today, prolonging the war and emboldening future aggressions.The IMF sees Russia's war on Ukraine as irrelevant to its policy mandate. Yet the war can't be ignored even if one insists on viewing economics in isolation from everything else: Russia's aggression is reshaping Europe's economy and destabilizing global markets.By choosing to look away from this grim reality, the Fund is effectively enabling Russia's actions.IMF to send its first delegation to Russia since full-scale invasion's start, Russian representative claimsThe last IMF mission to Russia was in 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic. 'We were excluded from this process under pressure from our Western 'friends,' and there were no further missions in 2022-23,' the IMF's Russian Executive Director Aleksei Mozhin said.The Kyiv IndependentNate OstillerThe mission to Moscow sends a clear message: Russia can count on the IMF's support even as it continues its war.The IMF's job is to promote global economic cooperation and stability, not to ensure the financial stability of an aggressor state. If it acts to boost Russia's economy, the IMF will be advancing Moscow's ability to keep the war going.The only way to bring this war to a just end is by crippling Russia's war machine. The rest of the international community—minus the Fund, apparently—understands this well.That's precisely why western governments have put so much effort into imposing a vast array of sanctions on Russia. Undermining the Russian economy is precisely the point. (It speaks volumes, by the way, that Aleksei Mozhin, the current Russian executive director of the IMF, is set to be replaced by ex-central bank official Ksenia Yudaeva, who has been under U.S. sanctions since April 2022.)In its reports, the IMF prefers to avoid blaming Russia for the direct effects of its invasion: economic shocks in Europe, soaring food prices in Africa, and the suffering of millions of people.As for Ukraine itself, it's estimated that repairing the damage from Russia's unprovoked invasion will cost hundreds of billions of dollars. The IMF's reluctance to confront these facts is nothing short of a lie.Rest assured that the Kremlin will make the most of the mission. Russian officials will hug and smile for the cameras, detailing every minute of the visit. They will cite it as proof that the war is as good as over, that Russia has been forgiven by the West, and that Ukraine no longer matters.Explainer: Ukraine's $15 billion IMF loan programMaxwell Kushnir is a research analyst at the IMF.

The IMF's actions will be spun as a signal that the West and the U.S. have written Ukraine off, leaving Russia powerful, prosperous, and influential.This mission sends another clear message: the man U.S. President Joe Biden once called a war criminal, Vladimir Putin of Russia, will now receive the imprimatur of one of the world's most reputable Western institutions. This is a diplomatic and moral disaster.The world cannot afford to let the IMF continue down this path of appeasement. The Fund must be held accountable for its actions. It cannot turn a blind eye to Russian atrocities while claiming to work toward global economic cooperation and stability.By normalizing relations with Russia, the IMF is doing more than just engaging in technical assessments—it is enabling a war that has killed hundreds of thousands and destabilized the world economy.If the IMF wants to live up to its mission of promoting monetary cooperation, trade, and economic growth, it must stand against Russia's aggression, not facilitate it.Estonian President Karis: We have to cross all 'red lines,' then start forcing Russia out of UkraineEstonian President Alar Karis is very diplomatic.

Ukraine appeals to UN, Red Cross over Russia apparently executing POW with sword	Ukraine's Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said on Sept. 17 that he had appealed to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations in response to a photo that allegedly shows the execution of a Ukrainian prisoner of war (POW) by Russia.On the morning of Sept. 17, a photo of an apparently executed Ukrainian soldier with a sword in his chest and the inscription 'For Kursk' appeared on social media. Remnants of gray tape are visible on the soldier's hand.The photo appears to show a bloodied body lying on the road against the backdrop of damaged vehicles and a house with broken windows. The exact location is unclear.The Kyiv Independent could not verify the photo.'The level of barbarism and bloodthirstiness is impossible to comprehend,' Lubinets wrote on his Telegram channel. The ombudsman stressed that such actions are a flagrant violation of the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War.There have been multiple reports of Ukrainian POWs being tortured or killed while in Russian captivity since the start of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. As of September, the Prosecutor General's Office said 28 criminal investigations were underway regarding the execution of 62 Ukrainian POWs.In early September, Lubinets reported another case of the alleged execution of a Ukrainian soldier, which was recorded on video.The footage allegedly showed a Russian soldier who asks a Ukrainian military service member if he wants to 'say the last word, pray before dying,' and then shoots him with a rifle three times.Russian POWs speak about their capture in Kursk OblastThe Kyiv Independent got exclusive access to the POWs captured during the Kursk operation and interviewed them about their motivations and experience of fighting for Russia.The Kyiv IndependentOlena Zashko	https://kyivindependent.com/ombudsman-appeals-to-un-red-cross/	2024-09-17T01:39:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1246182421.jpeg
EU preparing to raise up to 40 billion euros in loans for Ukraine without US, FT reports	The EU is preparing plans to gather up to 40 billion euros ($44.5 billion) in loans for Ukraine as Budapest keeps disrupting plans on a joint loan with the U.S., the Financial Times reported on Sept. 16, citing sources and a draft proposal.The Group of Seven (G7) agreed in June to provide Kyiv with a $50 billion loan covered by proceeds from frozen Russian assets, to be delivered by the end of the year. The plan envisaged the U.S. and EU both covering $20 billion, with the remaining $10 billion to be provided by the U.K., Canada, and Japan.The G7 countries have immobilized almost $300 billion in frozen Russian assets at the start of the full-scale invasion, with roughly two-thirds being held in the EU.Washington's condition was the EU extending the sanctions immobilizing Russian assets. The European Commission proposed to move from the usual six-month-rolling basis to 36 months to provide stronger safeguards.The FT wrote that Hungary has vetoed this step, hoping to push the final decision beyond the U.S. presidential election in November.While the commission prefers the joint loan with U.S. participation, Brussels must start working on an alternative as the relevant powers expire by the end of the year, the outlet reported.Such a proposal includes the EU raising between 20 billion euros ($22.3 billion) and 40 billion euros, with the final figure to be set after consultations between the commission and member states, officials told the FT. This move would require only majority support, circumventing Hungary's veto.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, seen as the most Russia-friendly EU leader, has repeatedly obstructed sanctions against Moscow and aid to Kyiv, claiming the West only prolongs and escalates the war.Orban has maintained close relations with Republican candidate Donald Trump, a fellow right-wing populist who promised to end the war 'within 24 hours.' Statements from Trump's inner circle indicate this could entail pressing Ukraine to give up on its NATO aspirations, or, allegedly, to cede territory Ukraine grows increasingly reliant on external financing as Russia's war puts ever stronger pressure on its economy. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that the country faces a budget deficit of $35 billion next year, though partners have committed to cover roughly $20 billion.Trump's 'peace plan' could include creation of demilitarized zone between Russia and Ukraine, Vance saysDonald Trump could bring Russians, Ukrainians, and Europeans to the negotiating table to 'figure out what a peaceful settlement looks like,' according to J.D.

Doctors Without Borders closes programs in Russia	Doctors Without Borders, an international humanitarian organization that focuses on providing medical aid in conflict zones, announced on Sept. 16 that its programs in Russia will be closed.Doctors Without Borders has been working in Russia since 1992. For 32 years, the organization has been engaged in the treatment and prevention of tuberculosis and HIV, assistance to the homeless, and humanitarian aid in Chechnya, Ingushetia, and Dagestan.The organization said that throughout the full-scale invasion, it was providing assistance to Russian citizens affected by Moscow's war in Ukraine and to Ukrainian citizens 'who crossed into Russia from Ukraine.' Nearly 1.3 million displaced Ukrainians have been registered in Russia as of December 2023, with the U.N. expressing 'concerns regarding their legal status, rights, and access to services within the country.' Research by Amnesty International showed that 'many displaced Ukrainians end up inside Russia or Russia-occupied territories involuntarily, even if they are not physically forced to move.'Doctors Without Borders said it was carrying out this work 'in partnership with local NGOs in the Belgorod and Rostov regions in the south of Russia.'The reason for the closure was that in August, the organization received a letter from the Russian Justice Ministry with a decision to exclude the affiliate office of the non-profit association 'Doctors Without Borders'(Netherlands) in Russia from the register of affiliate and representative offices of foreign NGOs, the statement read.'It is with a heavy heart that we have to close our activities in Russia. Our organization's work is guided by independence, impartiality, neutrality, and medical ethics. We provide assistance based on the needs,' said Yashovardhan, head of the Russian programs.The reason for the Justice Ministry's decision to exclude the organization's branch was not specified.The register shows only two branches of the organization as of Sept. 15, 2024: 'Doctors Without Borders' (Belgium) and 'Doctors Without Borders' (France). The first was removed from the register in 2009, while the second one, listed in 2006, has no removal date.

Meta blocks Russian state media across its platforms amid 'foreign interference activity'	U.S. tech giant Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, announced a global ban on Russian state-run media outlets like RT and Rossiya Segodnya, citing their involvement in covert influence operations.This move escalates the company's previous actions, which had focused on limiting the reach of these outlets and blocking their ads.The ban will be enforced across Meta's platforms, including Instagram and WhatsApp, over the next few days.The decision follows U.S. charges against RT employees for alleged efforts to influence the 2024 election, with Meta stating that Russian state media has a history of using deceptive tactics online.Earlier in September, the U.S. announced a sweeping crackdown on supposed Russian election interference, seizing 32 internet domains linked to Kremlin propaganda campaigns and sanctioning several high-profile propagandists working for RT.Alongside the new warning about RT, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that 'the State Department also designated the Russian state-funded and directed media company Rossiya Segodnya and five of its subsidiaries, including RT, under the Foreign Missions Act.'Kremlin propagandist attacked in Russia, possibly killed, Ukraine's intelligence reportsThe Kyiv Independent contacted Ukraine's military intelligence for confirmation of who was behind the attack.

As FIDE considers lifting sanctions, Ukrainian chess community calls for continued ban on Russian and Belarusian players	A group of 13 Ukrainian chess players has sent a letter to the International Chess Federation (FIDE), urging the continued ban on Russian and Belarusian players from competitions due to the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.They argued that lifting sanctions on these federations would be 'premature and deeply immoral given the ongoing circumstances.'Their appeal comes ahead of the FIDE General Assembly on September 22 in Budapest, where the assembly is set to consider the possibility of lifting the ban imposed on Russian and Belarusian players after February 2022.'We respectfully urge you to ensure that this topic is not even placed on the agenda for discussion,' the players wrote, calling for global solidarity with the Ukrainian chess community.This letter follows a similar call from Oleksandr Kamyshin, the president of the Ukrainian Chess Federation.FIDE has barred Russian and Belarusian flags from its events, but allowed players from Russia and Belarus to participate under the neutral FIDE flag.Toronto Film Festival resumes 'Russians at War' screening, ignoring widespread criticismAfter announcing on Sept. 12 that screenings of the controversial documentary 'Russians at War' would be paused due to 'significant threats to festival operations and public safety,' the film is set to return to the Toronto International Film Festival's lineup on Sept. 17.

Kazakh President Tokayev says 'Russia cannot be defeated'	Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev told German Chancellor Olaf Scholz during a visit to Astana on Sept. 16 that 'Russia cannot be defeated in the military sense.'Despite Astana's historically close ties to Moscow, Tokayev has taken a cautious approach to the full-scale war, refusing to recognize the legitimacy of Russia's illegal annexation of Ukrainian territories in 2022. At the same time, Kazakhstan has declined to abandon its long-standing relationship with Russia. 'It is a fact that Russia cannot be defeated in the military sense,' Tokayev told Scholz, in what was one of the clearest examples of Kazakhstan's pragmatic approach to Russia amid the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 'A further escalation of war will lead to irreparable consequences for the whole of humanity and above all for the countries involved in the Russia-Ukraine conflict,' Tokayev added. The Kazakh president also expressed support for a Chinese-Brazilian peace plan first pitched in May, which was dismissed by Scholz.In an interview earlier in September, President Volodymyr Zelensky called the six-point plan 'destructive' and characterized it as a 'political statement.'Kazakhstan has been an increasingly important player in the region amid Russia's deteriorating relations with the West and has been accused of being a key transit intermediary for sanctions evasion. Deputy Prime Minister Serik Zhumangarin said in August that Kazakhstan will not 'blindly follow the sanctions' if they affect domestic Kazakh companies. The Kazakh government has sought concessions from the West to allow for trade with Iran or to use the country for transit, but has been unsuccessful. According to Zhumangarin, Kazakhstan does not acknowledge any unilateral sanctions and intends to move forward with its domestic trade agenda regardless of the West. While visiting Germany in October 2023, Tokayev said that Kazakhstan would continue its economic cooperation with Russia while promising to adhere to the sanctions imposed on its northern neighbor.Russia, West fight for Kazakhstan as Astana plays both sidesOn the surface, Russian President Vladimir Putin's trip to Kazakhstan on Nov. 9 exuded an air of business as usual.

US announces sanctions against Georgian officials for human rights abuses	The U.S. Treasury Department announced on Sept. 16 a new tranche of sanctions targeting Georgian officials and two private citizens characterized as 'extremists' for their role in human rights abuses. 'Today's action underscores our concern about the consequences of anti-democratic actions in Georgia and efforts by key individuals to use violence and intimidation to achieve their aims,' said Treasury official Bradley Smith.Concerns about Georgia's democracy have reached a fever pitch after the ruling Georgian Dream party passed the foreign agents law, which requires organizations that receive foreign funding to be labeled as 'foreign agents' and mirrors repressive Russian legislation used to crack down on Kremlin regime critics.The U.S. previously announced travel restrictions in May for Georgian officials deemed to be responsible for 'undermining democracy' in the country. The latest round of measures was targeted at officials and citizens associated with 'violently suppressing the exercise of the freedom of peaceful assembly of Georgians engaged in the democratic process and peaceful expression.'It was the first tranche of sanctions that explicitly targeted officials by name. The Treasury Department specified that the abuses occurred during the historic protests that continued for months against the passage of the foreign agents law earlier in 2024. The violence against protesters was directed by Georgia's Interior Ministry and 'overseen by the Chief of the Special Task Department, Zviad Kharazishvili, and his Deputy, Mileri Lagazauri,' the Treasury Department said. Kharazishvili, known popularly in Georgia as Khareba, 'is well known for his punitive actions against political opponents and has been personally involved in the physical and verbal abuse of protestors.'Aside from the officials, the Treasury Department also announced sanctions against two private citizens, Konstantine Morgoshia and Zurab Makharadze, associated with the far-right and pro-Russian group Alt-Info, perhaps best known for organizing violence against the country's LGBTQ community. 'The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior,' the Treasury Department said.

Up to each NATO country to decide policy on Ukraine's long-range strike capabilities, Stoltenberg says	Each NATO country will be able to make an individual decision on whether to allow Ukraine to use Western weapons for long-range strikes into Russia, outgoing NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in an interview with the U.K.'s LBC Radio published on Sept. 16. 'It's for the individual allies to make these decisions, but it's important that we consult closely on these issues as we do,' Stoltenberg said. Ukraine is hoping for permission to use Western-supplied long-range missiles that it already possesses to strike military targets located deep inside Russian territory.Anticipation had been high last week ahead of meetings between President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Washington, but no announcement on a decision was made.As the discussions on the issue appeared to be closer to reaching a change in policy, Russian President Vladimir Putin and other officials have upped their rhetoric, claiming that such a move would mean that NATO is directly at war with Russia. Stoltenberg acknowledged the threats but said, 'There are no risk-free options in war.''But I continue to believe that the biggest risk for us will be if President Putin wins in Ukraine,' he added. Saber-rattling aside, some NATO countries have already begun to alter their stance on long-range strikes in recent days. The Guardian reported on Sept. 11, citing unnamed U.K. officials, that the British government had already made a positive decision regarding the usage of its Storm Shadow missiles ahead of a joint trip by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy to Kyiv.Other countries, such as Sweden, Finland, and Canada, have also come out to say they fully support Ukraine using Western-supplied weapons to hit deep into Russia.At the same time, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that Germany will not allow Ukraine to use its weapons for such long-range strikes 'even if other countries decide otherwise.'

US reassures, but sense of urgency questioned by Ukraine as $6 billion military aid hangs in the balance	News that $6 billion worth of outstanding U.S. military aid to Ukraine could expire by the end of September if Congress doesn't take urgent action is unsettling some in Kyiv, where the painful memory of a larger package delay that led to battlefield losses remains fresh.Delivering the $6 billion in additional U.S. aid depends on Congress extending the Pentagon's authority to send weapons from its stockpiles to Ukraine. It is part of a larger $61 billion package approved last April after a seven-month delay, despite being critical to helping Kyiv fight off Russia's full-scale invasion.U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has asked Congress to include the $6 billion, provided via the Presidential Drawdown Authority program (PDA), in any continuing resolution lawmakers may pass before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30 to fund the federal government and — yet again — prevent a shutdown. U.S. officials said they hope to have the authority extended for another year, but the Defense Department is looking into other options if that effort fails.It's unclear why the $6 billion in military aid was not provided earlier, given the urgent needs of Ukraine's armed forces in repelling Russia's full-scale invasion, nor what weaponry it could entail. Multiple government sources in Ukraine and the U.S. declined to discuss the issue in detail.The $6 billion is part of the $61 billion package approved in April, a congressional advisor who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the aid told the Kyiv Independent.The advisor added that the delay in disbursing it due to absorption capacity issues, domestic US stock constraints, and a 'constant flexibility issue with each withdrawal' in a situation where the U.S. adapts to Ukraine's needs.Ukraine's Defense Ministry told the Kyiv Independent that the weapons and equipment for the full amount were not yet sent to Ukraine due to 'the lack of the necessary weapons in the Pentagon's warehouses.' The ministry didn't specify which weapons were requested but assured that 'there is no reason to believe that these $6 billion will 'burn out.''An employee handles 155 mm caliber shells after the manufacturing process at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) in Scranton, Pennsylvania, U.S. on April 16, 2024. (Charly Truballeau / AFP via Getty Images)'As far as sources in Congress tell me, the situation is under control, and the money won't be lost - that's the main thing,' David Arakhamia, head of President Volodymyr Zelensky's Servant of the People faction in parliament, told the Kyiv Independent. But the episode appears to be the latest in which Ukraine's top Western ally is drip-feeding weaponry supplies to Ukraine, on purpose or due to a lack of urgency, in an existential war waged by Russia which Zelensky's administration has described as 'genocidal.' Addressing the annual Yalta European Strategy forum held in Kyiv on Sept. 13-14, Biden's national security chief Jake Sullivan spoke of plans to announce a significant assistance package for Ukraine by the end of this month.Yet the sense of many in Kyiv, which is shared with some European allies, is that while the U.S. has stepped up military assistance sharply, it is still not providing sufficient amounts and fast enough to help Ukraine decisively win the war.'It is crucial that all states, and especially those like the United States, implement our agreements really promptly,' Zelensky said in his Sept. 14 evening address to the nation.'Every delay in military packages has its negative consequences at the front. Every truly timely, fast delivery has a positive impact. I briefed the Congressmen on the current situation and the prospects,' he added.Ukrainian drones strike deeper into Russia, aiming to break war machine, sow discontentJust before sunrise on an otherwise sleepy weekend near Moscow, a Russian eyewitness of Ukraine's kamikaze drone attack on the Kashira Power Plant appeared stunned, unleashing an expletive-laden tirade with his wife alongside.

Wow, honey!' he said in a video po...The Kyiv IndependentOleg SukhovZelensky, who is to meet with Biden later this month in the U.S. for talks on future assistance and lifting of restrictions on using Western missiles to strike Russian territory, expressed the same frustration one day earlier about promised but not yet delivered military weaponry from Western allies without directly mentioning the $6 billion U.S. aid.As he addressed the annual Yalta European Strategy meeting in Kyiv, Zelensky said that it's 'really difficult to hear the same answer every time - 'we are working on it.''He also said that the talks on equipping Ukrainian frontline brigades with the West's help had been ongoing 'for months,' with the same vague answer from some 'leaders and states that have made responsible commitments' earlier.'Frankly, we are still far from fully implementing what we have agreed on a long time ago,' Zelensky added.Washington's delay from late 2023 into this spring in passing a $61 billion aid package for Ukraine contributed to the deteriorating situation on the eastern Donbas frontline, where Russia's grinding offensive made advances. In almost seven months of political infighting in the U.S. before the aid was allocated, Ukraine lost some key territories, including the city of Avdiivka, and suffered significant damage to its energy infrastructure around the country due to the lack of air defense systems to counter Russian missile strikes. The legislation was first opposed but later approved by Republican legislators loyal to Donald Trump, who seeks to return as president in a Nov. 5 election against Vice President Kamala Harris. Sense of urgency often lost despite sky-high stakesThe risk of yet another delay in crucial assistance from Ukraine's top Western ally comes as the country's Armed Forces, outgunned and outmanned, continue to battle Russia's full-scale invasion two and a half years into the bloodiest conflict in Europe since World War II. And as Zelensky continues to press the U.S. and other Western allies for permission to use their long-range missile for strikes into Russian territory.'We have seen this pattern time and again — delays in the allocation of funding, delays in deployment, and delays in deliveries,' Tymofiy Mylovanov, president of the Kyiv School of Economics and former advisor to Zelensky's administration, told the Kyiv Independent.'The sense of urgency is often lost in the Western capitals, but this directly translates into lives lost and an unsafer world. Simply irresponsible,' Mylovanov said.The Biden administration and some European leaders have in the past years expressed fears that arming Ukraine too much — in essence, giving it enough weapons to win the war — could provoke Russia to escalate and potentially use nuclear weapons. Russian President Vladimir Putin and others in his regime have made such threats. Repeating them recently, they said that the West would be at war with Russia if it allowed its long-range missiles to be used by Ukraine for strikes deep inside Russia.Ukraine, which most recently seized a patch of Russian territory with the Kursk incursion, claims such threats are empty.'Putin's threats do not work. Ukraine's allies should not fall for them,' Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a Sept. 15 post on X, where he outlined how Russia has during the war repeatedly threatened escalation if Western allies armed Ukraine.'Putin uses threats to weaken support for Ukraine. Instead, allies should boost it. Lift restrictions. Bolster Ukraine's long-range strength, air shield, and economic and energy resilience. Fear and inaction only lead to deaths and crises. To restore peace, we need bravery, not fear,' Sybiha added.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken (L) and Britain's Foreign Secretary David Lammy (R) pose with Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Minister Andrii Sybiha (C) during their meeting in Kyiv, on Sep. 11, 2024, amid the Russian invasion on Ukraine. (Leon Neal / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)Some influential members of both Republican and Democratic parties in the U.S. Congress have called for the Biden administration to lift restrictions on using Western missiles on Russian territory and to further boost long-term military assistance to Ukraine.They also wish to swiftly resolve the $6 billion aid issue.'It is highly disappointing that nearly $6 billion of the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) remains untouched as we near the end of the fiscal year,' Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, told the Kyiv Independent. 'The administration must utilize all remaining PDA to provide Ukraine with the capabilities it needs to win this war — just as Congress intended when it provided this authority in the national security supplemental earlier this year,' McCaul added.Democratic Congressman Jim Costa told the Kyiv Independent, 'We are set to work this out,' adding that there might be some friction on the new appropriations package, but the issue is a priority. When asked about the matter by the Kyiv Independent, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William B. Taylor said he was assured by a senior Pentagon official 'not to worry' — that the funds would not expire.'Six billion dollars is serious money... And there are two people in the U.S. government (who know the details of this question) that I talk to all the time... One of them is Laura Cooper, the deputy assistant secretary for defense for arming Ukraine,' Taylor said during an informal press briefing in Kyiv.Cooper 'knows the details of this $6 billion... and she said, 'Bill, don't worry.' And for her to tell me that, I take it,' Taylor said without providing any further details.'Dangerous' delays as rogue states weaponry flows into RussiaBut Mylovanov said the pattern of delays and restrictions on the use of weaponry provided 'is very dangerous and in fact irresponsible.''It was so difficult getting the ($61 billion) supplemental passed. And now there is this bureaucratic (and political?) process that jeopardizes $6 billion,' Mylovanov quipped.He pointed to uninterrupted missile and other weaponry supplies to Russia from rogue states Iran and North Korea.'Iran and North Korea don't appear to be constrained by delays, permissions, and bureaucracy when sending weapons to Russia. Nor are they constraining Russia in how it can use their weapons,' Mylovanov said.The Pentagon is seeking an extension from Congress of PDA authorities beyond the end of the fiscal year, a spokesperson told the Kyiv Independent.'The Department will continue to provide drawdown packages in the near future,' the Pentagon's statement said.U.S. Military Aid for Ukraine. (Dragon Capital)Publicly, the Pentagon gave similarly nebulous assurances.'I have no doubt that we are going to use everything we can that's available to us to make sure that we are continuing to provide Ukraine what it needs both in the short term and the long term,' Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said during a press briefing on Sept. 5.'We're in this fight with Ukraine for the long haul...

He added that he discussed the matter with the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy who visited Kyiv recently.'I hope that after our conversation, there simply cannot be any unanswered questions about why Ukraine needs sufficient long-range capability,' Zelensky said.Kyiv Independent Deputy Editor-in-Chief Oleksiy Sorokin contributed reporting to this story.The Russian targets that could be on Ukraine's long-range missile strike listIn recent weeks, Ukraine's hopes have been buoyed that its Western allies will finally allow their long-range weapons to strike deep into Russian territory.

Trump shooting suspect Ryan Wesley Routh — personal interactions in Ukraine raise questions about support for Kyiv	Almost immediately after a reported second assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, reports emerged of the suspect's apparent support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia.Text messages shared with the Kyiv Independent and conversations with other foreigners living and working in Ukraine paint a picture, however, of a person who misrepresented himself, expressed disdain for Ukraine's war effort, and had delusional ideas of his place in international affairs.The suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, was taken into custody after the Secret Service on Sept. 15 opened fire on an armed individual at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida where Trump was playing golf.Media interviews, social media posts, and videos dug up after his arrest display Routh's passionate support for Ukraine. Routh also spent time Ukraine after the start of the full-scale invasion, and in an interview with the New York Times in June 2023 described plans to recruit Afghan soldiers to fight in the country's International Legion, a military unit composed of foreign volunteers.Shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Routh claimed on the social media platform X that he was ready to fight and die in the war against Russia.'I AM WILLING TO FLY TO KRAKOW AND GO TO THE BORDER OF UKRAINE TO VOLUNTEER AND FIGHT AND DIE,' he wrote.Russian state media have seized on the reports, describing Routh as a 'pro-Kyiv activist.'Controversial U.S. lawmaker Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has a history of parroting Kremlin propaganda lines, also said Routh was 'obsessed with the Ukraine war,' and said the U.S. Congress 'must demand answers' about his links to Ukraine.But a WhatsApp conversation in November 2023 with Evelyn Aschenbrenner, who worked in an admin role with the International Legion for the Defense of Ukraine at the time, suggests his support for Ukraine wasn't as solid as his social media posts made out.In the conversation, of which Aschenbrenner shared screen shots with the Kyiv Independent, Routh began by saying he had 'thousands of Afghan soldiers if you need soldiers.'The scene outside the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach after a man pointed a gun toward the course while former president Donald Trump was golfing in Florida, United States on Sep. 15, 2024. (Carlos Escalona/Anadolu via Getty Images)Aschenbrenner responded by saying 'that sounds like a massive security risk,' adding: 'The Legion has a recruiting system that you are not part of. You are absolutely not helping anything by doing this.''And PLEASE do not start telling thousands of Afghans to come to Ukraine. That's absurd. If you did nothing at all, I'd be grateful,' Aschenbrenner added.Routh's tone changed dramatically, and he replied by telling Aschenbrenner that he 'lives in Hawaii on a beautiful sandy beach with beautiful girls in bikinis all day.'When Aschenbrenner said that was a 'weird thing to say to a female soldier,' Routh then went on to express contempt for Ukraine's plight amid Russia's invasion.'Really... point is I am happy and not worried about Ukraine. Congress is cutting off all funding now it seems. Good luck,' he said.'Ukraine has chased away all foreign support. Once China attacks Taiwan they can give everything they have to Putin. The gates will be open and I and the world will see the end of Ukraine...'In a comment to the Kyiv Independent, Aschenbrenner said Routh 'has been consistently lying that he's connected to the International Legion.''Despite many foreign recruiters and soldiers, as well as Ukrainian officers and commanders, asking him to stop, Routh has repeatedly misrepresented himself,' Aschenbrenner added.The International Legion for the Defense of Ukraine, on Sept. 16 rejected any connections to Routh.'We would like to clarify that Ryan Wesley Routh has never been part of, associated with, or linked to the International Legion in any capacity,' the Legion said in a post on social media.'Any claims or suggestions indicating otherwise are entirely inaccurate.'Social media users also warned in June of this year that Routh was 'misrepresenting himself and lying to many people.'Warning about Ryan Routh: he is not, and never has been, associated with the International Legion or the Ukrainian Armed Forces at all.

Toronto Film Festival resumes ‘Russians at War’ screening, ignoring widespread criticism	After announcing on Sept. 12 that screenings of the controversial documentary 'Russians at War' would be paused due to 'significant threats to festival operations and public safety,' the film is set to return to the Toronto International Film Festival's lineup on Sept. 17.The Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) runs from Sept. 6 to Sept. 15, so the organizers appear to be holding two special screenings of the film on Sept. 17 outside of the official program.The film was initially pulled in response to significant public backlash both within Canada and internationally, as well as protests held on site at the festival. The Ukrainian Canadian Congress, which spearheaded the initial protests, has pledged to continue their efforts following TIFF's ongoing commitment to showing the film.The Toronto police had not been 'aware of any active threats' that would have led the festival to initially limit the screenings of the film, a spokesperson told Canadian media on Sept. 12.Canadian-Russian director Anastasia Trofimova's documentary has faced criticism for what many perceive as an attempt to whitewash the Russian soldiers involved in Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. During her press tour, Trofimova emphasized that the soldiers featured in her film were 'just ordinary guys' and claimed she did not witness any war crimes during her time with them.Canadian media coverage of the documentary has echoed these sentiments, framing the soldiers as mere pawns in Russian President Vladimir Putin's war. This conclusion has only been met with more backlash given that many of the soldiers portrayed in 'Russians at War' are contract soldiers and therefore chose to participate in the invasion of a sovereign state voluntarily.The organizers of TIFF have claimed in 'no way should this film be considered Russian propaganda.'But critics of the documentary who saw it have noted several issues, perhaps the biggest being Trofimova's omission of the Ukrainian perspective - those defending themselves against an invasion. The documentary also lacks a concrete counter-narrative to Russian propaganda, fails to address documented Russian war crimes, and does not offer a definitive critique of Putin's regime.'Russians at war' promo material. (TIFF/YouTube)As Dutch film critic Hugo Emmerzael told the Kyiv Independent, 'By blurring the boundaries between the capturing of reality at the front and constructing a narrative at this very same site of conflict, the film becomes an extension of the war apparatus it pretends to examine.' Trofimova also admitted to violating Ukraine's territorial integrity herself by crossing illegally into the country through Russia, telling the Canadian press, 'I'm a citizen of Russia and by Russia standards, this is now considered to be Russian territory, you can just pass through there if you have your passport.' 'The film becomes an extension of the war apparatus it pretends to examine.' Trofimova has also claimed that she filmed on the front line without permission from Russia's Defense Ministry.These ethical issues regarding how she filmed the documentary are compounded by the fact that it was partly financed by public Canadian funds. Since the start of Russia's full-scale war, Canada has been a significant ally of Ukraine, providing the country with over $8 billion in military, financial, and humanitarian aid.Some of the strongest criticism against the film has been made in comments to Russian independent media by Ukrainians and Russians in exile.'You know, it's a trick of documentary filmmaking - when you choose an object to film, and when you go with a camera to one side, and you film the 'exact truth' of the trenches which is 'obscured by the fog of war,' willingly or unwillingly, you choose a side,' Ukrainian film producer Alexander Rodnyansky, who worked in Russia for decades and fled after the full-scale war, said in an interview on Sept. 10.Rodnyansky noted that while Russian soldiers in the film sense that 'something isn't right' with their actions in Ukraine, they continue to echo the same propaganda narratives broadcasted on Russian state-controlled television.'The most important thing is that I don't believe she worked there (on the front line) without the agreement of the Russian Defense Ministry. To spend (that amount of time) with a battalion is not possible. We understand very well how Russia is organized, and more so, she was wearing the Russian military uniform. It goes against all the rules of journalism.' Critics also noted the subtleties in the film which Westerners who do not speak Russian and are unfamiliar with the history of the region might miss. In her review for Novaya Gazeta Europa, Russian film critic Irina Karpova highlighted the dissonance in Trofimova's voiceover with her emphasis on the 'a' in 'Ukrainian,' which evokes the Russian word 'krai,' meaning 'edge,' and implies linguistically that Ukraine is the borderland of Russia. This is a common mispronunciation among Russian speakers. People stand in the rain, waiting for an evening movie premier along King Street W, during the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival in Toronto, Ontario on Sep. 6, 2024. (Jay L. Clendenin/Getty Images)Karpova also questioned the achieved outcome of the film. 'Trofimova tries to see the humanity in Russian soldiers, but the footage she captures seems to confirm, rather than refute, the portrayal of Russian soldiers as depicted by YouTube channels like those of (Russian propagandists) Michael Nacke or Vladimir Milov. Even fascists suffer too,' Karpova wrote.Ukrainian-Russian film director Vitaly Mansky, who moved from Russia to Latvia in 2014, told TV Rain that the film could only be shown in the same vein as the work of Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl at this year's Venice Film Festival, with one goal, to show that she wasn't an independent documentarian.'It's a very professionally made film, but in professional language, it's easy to expose (its problems). If the author of the film says supporting only one side of the film stops the war from ending, here it is very clear that the author is on the side of the heroes of her film,' Mansky said. A frequently raised concern regarding Trofimova is that several of her earlier documentaries were produced by RT Documentary, a Russian state-owned channel. Some critics continue to question her potential ties to Russia's war apparatus, with many suggesting that these connections may have influenced her editorial decisions in filmmaking.Trofimova herself brushed off these concerns, saying in an interview with the Globe and Mail that when 'the relatively liberal atmosphere in which we were working started to change' she left RT for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).This period of a 'relatively liberal atmosphere' took place against the backdrop of Russia's illegal annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and invasion of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in 2014.Yet there are instances from after the start of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine that provoke scrutiny.In a public post on her Facebook from Jan. 4, 2023, Trofimova eulogized Kirill Romanovsky, a famous Russian war journalist with close ties to the Wagner mercenary group, which has played a huge role in Russia's war against Ukraine. Romanovsky died under unclear circumstances in Africa, where Wagner also operates.'In your frontline stories, there was no falsehood or that pretentious, overly subdued baritone. You were like that in everything — genuine, compassionate, and real,' Trofimova wrote, adding that he 'managed to do something very right in this life.'Romanovsky's book 'Eight Years with Wagner' includes interviews with members of the mercenary group. Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin, before his own death in 2023, called Romanovsky his 'comrade' and praised him for 'doing a lot' for Russia. Sean Farnel, who has identified himself as a consulting producer on the documentary 'Russians at War,' has criticized people online who spoke out against the film and Trofimova's background making documentaries for Russian state-owned media.Farnel told one user on X, formerly known as Twitter, that people were 'obsessed' with this part of her filmography, failing to acknowledge why it is highly problematic.Is 'Russians at War' propaganda? We asked 7 people in film who saw itThe documentary 'Russians at War' has sparked controversy since its debut on the festival circuit, with many accusing it of whitewashing Russian soldiers and their crimes in Ukraine. Canadian-Russian director Anastasia Trofimova has defended the film, calling it 'anti-war.' After facing backlash,...The Kyiv IndependentKate TsurkanNote from the author:Hi, this is Kate Tsurkan, sharing an important culture-related story from Ukraine. It's honestly a bit maddening to see that this film about Russian soldiers got made in the first place and that some film critics are defending it. But if you talk to people who actually suffer firsthand from Russia's war, and their allies, you hear entirely different feedback. It's important to note the difference.

Kremlin propagandist attacked in Russia, possibly killed, Ukraine's intelligence reports	Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) said on Sept. 16 that a Kremlin propagandist has been killed in the Russian city of Belgorod. In a post on Telegram, HUR said Aleksandr Korobov died on Sept. 15 after his skull was 'crushed.'According to Russian news outlets, Korobov was heavily injured in an apparent assassination attempt. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claim.Korobov - nicknamed 'Crab' - appeared as a war correspondent on Kremlin state media channel, Russia 1, and HUR said he also headed its Belgorod branch.'The propagandist not only prepared false materials about the war, but also personally participated in the commission of serious war crimes against Ukraine,' military intelligence said, adding that Korobov regularly worked in occupied areas of Ukraine.‼️ 'Крабу' проломили череп — на росії ліквідовано воєнного злочинця та пропагандиста кремля  https://t.co/SYlxXhZP3w pic.twitter.com/UTHwQSLcyp— Defence intelligence of Ukraine (@DI_Ukraine) September 16, 2024 While HUR did not claim responsibility for the attack, the post included both current and former home addresses for Korobov, and noted he 'periodically visited Moscow according to instructions.' It also contained what appears to be covertly recorded, and watermarked footage of a man resembling Korobov walking down the street which then cuts to a close-up of what HUR claims is his dead body.'The military intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reminds that there will be a fair retribution for every war crime,' the post reads.The Kyiv Independent contacted HUR for confirmation of who was behind the attack. It replied with a smiling face with sunglasses emoji.After HUR announced details of the attack, the head of the Belgorod State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, Nadezhda Vlasova, said Korobov was injured and in hospital, but had not been killed.The Russian targets that could be on Ukraine's long-range missile strike listIn recent weeks, Ukraine's hopes have been buoyed that its Western allies will finally allow their long-range weapons to strike deep into Russian territory.

Journalist Georgiy Gongadze, murdered 24 years ago, commemorated in downtown Kyiv on the day of his abduction	A memorial was held in Kyiv on Sept. 16 to mark the 24th anniversary of the abduction of Ukrainian journalist Georgiy Gongadze.A number of Ukrainian journalists gathered in downtown Kyiv to open a temporary 'memorial alley,' where, over the course of a week, people can learn more about one of Ukraine's first high-profile journalists murdered for his work.Gongadze, who was critical of then-President Leonid Kuchma, was kidnapped on Sept. 16, 2000. Two months later, his headless body was found in a forest some 70 kilometers outside Kyiv.Tapes later surfaced of Kuchma talking about Gongadze, saying he needs to be dealt with, without explicitly ordering his assassination.Though there was no direct order to kill Gongadze, the scandal prompted mass protests in Kyiv, calling for Kuchma's resignation and making him a prime suspect in the case. He was never officially charged.Three police officers were sentenced to 12 years in jail for their roles in Gongadze's murder, while in January 2016, Oleksiy Pukach, ex-head of the Interior Ministry of Ukraine's surveillance department, was sentenced to life.But despite the sentences, no one has ever been charged with ordering Gongadze's murder.In an op-ed for Ukrainska Pravda on Sept. 16, Gongadze's daughter, Nana, paid tribute to her father as well as 'other fallen journalists' who 'put themselves in harm's way to show the world what is truly happening here, just as my father did when he exposed the corruption of the Kuchma regime.'She highlighted that despite the importance of the work of journalists, 'press freedom in Ukraine is at risk.'Highlighting in particular the work of David Knowles of The Telegraph, who died of a cardiac arrest earlier this month, she added: 'We must honor their sacrifices by closely monitoring and strengthening our press freedom.'	https://kyivindependent.com/journalist-georgiy-gongadze-murdered-24-years-ago-commemorated-in-downtown-kyiv-on-the-day-of-his-abduction/	2024-09-16T09:53:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/8_main-v1726497892.webp
Weapons restrictions, fears of escalation are 'pointless,' Estonian president says	Estonian President Alar Karis is very diplomatic.His country of 1.3 million people borders Russia, while the ongoing messy election campaign in Washington, D.C. forces European diplomats to question whether the U.S. will help countries like Estonia in case of a direct confrontation with Moscow.Despite that, Karis doesn't avoid questions, saying that Russia must be defeated and NATO allies must do more to make it happen.'We probably realize now that we have to cross all of these red lines and then start forcing Russia out of Ukraine,' Karis told the Kyiv Independent in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of the 20th annual Yalta European Strategy (YES) Conference in Kyiv.According to Karis, NATO countries must do more for their own defense, Kyiv must be allowed to fire Western missiles without any restrictions, while peace with Russia can be only achieved on Ukrainian terms.Estonian President Alar Karis talks during an interview with the Kyiv Independent on Sept. 14, 2024. (The Kyiv Independent)The Kyiv Independent: Mr. President, recently, there's been a lot of news about Russian drones hitting countries not far from Ukraine. Most recently Latvia, and before that, it was Romania, Poland... What's the Estonian position about shooting down Russian drones that enter NATO countries?Alar Karis: We are in a very simple position, we should lift the restrictions on the use of weapons that Ukraine gets from the Western world so we can target these drones where they start (on Russian territory). When this happens, the drones never reach Ukraine, Latvia, or any other country.The Kyiv Independent: Do you think because NATO countries don't down those drones, Russia thinks that NATO is not serious in its intention?Alar Karis: I don't think so. Firstly, we have to know whether it's by accident or if it's deliberate. Latvia and Estonia rely on NATO. We have to start the discussions about how to behave in these kinds of situations, and the discussions have started already.The Kyiv Independent: If, by accident or intentionally, a Russian drone enters Estonia, is the Estonian military allowed to shoot down the drone, or does it need to ask NATO beforehand?Alar Karis: It's a very hypothetical question: What's going to happen and if. As I said, we discussed with our allies, how to behave in this kind of situation.Opinion: What a Trump presidency could look like for Ukraine'Trump will end the Ukraine war.'

Do you think that Estonia is protected enough by being a member of NATO if ex-President Donald Trump enters the White House?Alar Karis: Donald Trump has been president once, and, at that time, we were a NATO member. We don't only rely on NATO allies. We also spend quite a number of our own resources on defense. Next year, it'll be about 3%. What we should do, and we do, is to convince other NATO countries to put more than 2% on defense.The Kyiv Independent: Concerning the recent debate, former President Donald Trump said on multiple occasions that he wants peace, but he never said that he wants Ukraine to win. Do you believe that in the West (especially in the United States), most politicians and both presidential candidates want Ukraine to actually win this war?Alar Karis: We want to defeat Russia, that's for sure. You have to understand that presidential elections in the U.S. mean that there's a debate going on different issues. It's a different situation than when one becomes a president, so let's wait. It's the American people's decision who is going to be the president of the United States. For us, it's very important to keep this transatlantic bond.As far as defense (goes), the U.S. should be number one (leading) in this case.ATACMS restrictions subject of 'intense consultations' between Ukraine and allies, Sullivan saysATACMS restrictions are 'the subject of intense consultation among allies and partners, and will be (discussed) between President (Biden) and President Zelensky,' U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said.The Kyiv IndependentThe Kyiv Independent news deskThe Kyiv Independent: There has been a recent change of doctrine. Now, there is a policy that all three Baltic states want to build a defense line, not allowing Russians to enter the country as a whole. Do you think that Estonia and your neighboring countries are now well-equipped to hold off the Russian army in case it wants to invade?Alar Karis: Of course, we are. But the doctrine is, in a way... What should we do? We are a small country. That means we have to make sure that the enemy does not enter our territory. It's as simple as that.The Kyiv Independent: There has recently been an uptick in Estonian activity. Your former prime minister will be the foreign secretary of the European Union. Do you feel that now, finally, after years of war in Ukraine, Western capitals are hearing the Eastern flank of NATO and the European Union more?Alar Karis: I guess so. Our Western allies, which are much further away from the Russian border, started to understand what this war in Ukraine means not only for Ukraine but also for them. It's not only us who are next to Russia; it's Europe and NATO countries. I think our partners have realized that. And they started to assist and help Ukraine and also to think about their own defense.The Kyiv Independent: Do you think that if Washington, London, and Berlin had listened more to Tallinn or Warsaw before the start of the full-scale war, the situation would have been different?Alar Karis: Well, definitely, it would've been different, but we don't know what kind of difference it would have been. These countries are used to this peaceful life - no war, nothing. And we were naive. But we did wake up earlier than our friends far away. What would have happened, I don't know.Putin delays new mobilization, despite Kursk incursion exposing troop shortagesAmid speculation that the Kremlin is considering a new mobilization of conscripts, some potential draftees say they are not enthusiastic about defending Russian territory just over a month after the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast.

I swore an oath to the Constituti...The Kyiv IndependentOleg SukhovThe Kyiv Independent: Do you see an increase in Russian intelligence activity or Russian psyops (psychological operations) in Estonia?Alar Karis: Russian intelligence is everywhere. And its propaganda is everywhere, not only in Estonia, but all over the world. You see, even in the United States, they interfere in elections, not only in Europe. So we have to be ready for that. Also, now there is misinformation that is spread by Russia, cyber-attacks, and so forth. So it's not a question of Estonia. It's everywhere, and we have to prepare for this. We have been prepared for cyber-attacks for quite a long time, because they started in 2007. We also start to convince also Western parties that this is a very important issue.The Kyiv Independent: At the beginning of this year, there was a huge case with one professor in Estonia convicted of being a Russian agent in Estonia. How has the Estonian security force scaled up its activity to make sure that there are no Russian agents currently in Estonia?Alar Karis: As you said, we did catch these agents. That means our intelligence works pretty well. And it's not the only case. It has also happened before. So we are ready. Also, agents become smarter. We have to be ready, especially in universities, where a lot of new information and innovations are available. We have to be careful. That's it.From Estonian university professor to convicted Russian spy: the curious case of Viacheslav MorozovEditor's Note: Kyiv Independent News Editor Nate Ostiller briefly attended a summer program at the same Estonian university where the main character of this report was a professor and received a passing grade in a one-week summer school course. A university professor is not the first profession th...The Kyiv IndependentNate OstillerThe Kyiv Independent: You mentioned at the beginning of our interview that Ukraine needs to be allowed to strike Russian targets in Russia. Do you actually know why it's taking so long for many countries to allow this?Alar Karis: One thing is probably that some countries and some leaders are afraid of escalation. There is no escalation anymore. Russia has crossed all red lines already. There is no point in being afraid of escalation. These restrictions are just pointless.The Kyiv Independent: Do you think that the war could have been drastically different if all of this had been allowed a year or two ago?Alar Karis: Probably. But the thing is, any country has a different history, political parties, and ideas. That means it does take time. We are not countries with dictators; we are democratic countries. That means you have to also convince your people, not only politicians.Unfortunately, it does take more time. We also hoped that this one step would help - it didn't; the next - didn't either. We probably realize now that we have to cross all of these red lines and then start forcing Russia out of Ukraine.The Kyiv Independent: Russia always says that if its territory is attacked, then it can use nuclear arms. Right now, we have Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast. Do you think that it's still a relevant possibility that Russia will use nuclear weapons, or the European allies and the United States should stop worrying about Russian nuclear saber-rattling?Alar Karis: Russia knows very well that it's not the only nuclear power in Europe and in the world. I don't think we are going to test a nuclear attack on any country.The Kyiv Independent: Estonia has been doing a lot for Ukraine since day one. Can you please explain why, from the first day of the full-scale invasion, Estonia was one of the countries that provided both the most military and humanitarian help (as a percentage of GDP) to Ukraine and why, despite years of war, Estonia continues to do it?Alar Karis: We have our own history, and we know what occupation meant when the Soviet Union occupied our country. We and our parents have this kind of memory - that's one reason. As a small independent country, we can't afford for these powerful countries to cross the border of independent countries. We'll continue to support Ukraine, of course.The Kyiv Independent: Do you think that the world is now tired of this war? We hear some voices saying that maybe Ukraine needs a plan B, maybe Ukraine won't be able to de-occupy all of its territory, and it needs to hold peace talks with Russia. Do you feel that as long as this war continues, more voices in the West will try to persuade Ukraine to find a solution to the war that doesn't involve de-occupying all of its territory?Alar Karis: At this very moment, we can't afford these big peace talks because (Russian President Vladimir) Putin has already said what he wants. He wants NATO back to the 1997 borders, Donbas, other Ukrainian regions, and so forth.That means, as I said, we should push Russia back to its territory and convince it that this war was useless. Then we can sit behind the table and start talking. We have a peace plan - a peace formula provided by Zelensky. It's the only peace plan at this very moment.The Kyiv Independent: Do you think NATO countries and NATO as a whole are doing enough to help Ukraine win?Alar Karis: It's never enough. We could do more. We could do much more. Also, while here in Kyiv, I mentioned that we should do more — not only Estonia and other states, but we all. We are on the side of democracy, and we should do much more.Estonian PM: 'Our taxpayers shouldn't pay for damages caused by Russia'Editor's Note: This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Opinion: Putin’s red carpet in Mongolia was a betrayal of justice and accountability	Mongolia's president welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin in the capital of Ulaanbaatar on Sept. 3 for an official ceremony commemorating a Soviet-Mongolian military victory during World War II. While Putin has attended such ceremonies regularly over the years, the key difference this time was that he traveled to an International Criminal Court (ICC) member country as a fugitive of the ICC. It was the first time Putin visited an ICC member since the court made his arrest warrant public in March 2023.As an ICC member, Mongolia was obligated to arrest him, but it did not.There's no question about what Mongolia was required to do. Putin should never have been invited in the first place, and as soon as he set foot on Mongolian soil, he should have been arrested - not met with a red carpet. Opinion: State predation threatens to derail Ukraine's war effortRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has led to a resurgence in state predation against businesses, now approaching pre-EuroMaidan levels. This issue cannot be postponed until after the war. Politicized, predatory actions by law enforcement agencies against both domestic and fore...The Kyiv IndependentAlan RileyThe Mongolian government failed the victims of grave international crimes in Ukraine. It also failed its own commitment as an ICC member to be part of the global community supporting victims' access to justice through the court and its broader system of accountability. The principle that no one, no matter how powerful, is above the law is a cornerstone of that system. The Mongolian government failed the victims of grave international crimes in Ukraine. The ICC cannot, on its own, make this ideal a reality. The court relies on member countries to cooperate and enforce its arrest warrants. Last year, Putin was expected to attend a BRICS summit in South Africa. But along with pressure from civil society groups, a legal case helped ensure that South Africa's obligation to execute the ICC arrest warrant would be upheld domestically. 'By mutual agreement,' the South African president announced, Putin's visit was ultimately canceled.To be sure, arresting a suspect is one of the most difficult challenges in delivering international justice. It is a long road, but with persistence, principled support for justice, and, crucially, political will, progress is possible. South Africa's example shows that the world of ICC fugitives, no matter how powerful, can shrink significantly.Russian President Russian President Vladimir Putin during his speech at the meeting in Zaryadye Hall, in Moscow, Russia Sep. 7, 2024. (Contributor/Getty Images)It took 12 years to arrest Radovan Karadžić, but he was ultimately convicted in 2016 for his crimes in Bosnia by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The European Union conditioned closer ties with Serbia, where Karadžić was hiding, on its full cooperation with the ICTY, including the arrest and surrender of fugitives. This example should remind countries that international justice only works when they support its enforcement.Looking ahead, every step will matter to ensure that future arrests materialize. The ICC treaty provides for enforcement proceedings against non-cooperating states. It remains to be seen whether these will be applied to Mongolia. In the meantime, there are already consequences. The Mongolian government's inaction has been widely condemned, with states and regional organizations like the EU speaking out in support of the court.All other ICC members should reinforce these efforts and strongly condemn Mongolia for failing to meet its legal obligations. This is key to upholding the authority of the court's warrants and ensuring ICC suspects are arrested in the long term.Opinion: How Kamala Harris' foreign policy could depart from Biden's legacyFollowing President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race and Vice President Kamala Harris' ascension to the top of the Democratic ticket, a crucial question emerges: How would Harris' foreign policy depart from Biden's? Biden entered the White House as the most experienced and kno...The Kyiv IndependentIan BremmerOther ICC members have the responsibility and tools to ensure the Mongolia visit remains just a dent in cooperation and support for the court. Victims, their families, and survivors need to know they can rely on the ICC to pursue justice.At the same time, Ukraine is taking important steps to advance the promise of justice. After years of campaigning by national and international human rights groups, in late August, Ukraine's parliament passed a law to ratify the ICC treaty. The country has never been closer to becoming a full member of the court, whose investigation into grave crimes committed in Ukraine has already yielded six significant arrest warrants as the fighting continues.However, Ukraine's newly enacted law includes limitations on the ICC's mandate that, if acted on, could shield war criminals from justice. Ukraine should support the court and its work without reservations. Only a strong and full commitment to the ICC will show the principled approach to justice that Ukraine and the world need.Putin's trip to Mongolia is an important reminder that there is still much to do to end impunity for the most serious crimes. Today, tomorrow, every day, it takes creative, principled, and sometimes courageous action by ICC members and other supportive states to uphold justice, the court's work, and its decisions.Editor's Note: The opinions expressed in the op-ed section are those of the authors and do not purport to reflect the views of the Kyiv Independent.

UK's Starmer seeking European support for Ukraine long-range missile strike proposal, Bloomberg reports	British Prime Minister Keir Starmer held talks in Italy with his Italian counterpart on Sept. 16, in an effort to gain support for his proposal to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles to strike deep inside Russia.Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported that Starmer will also hold similar talks in France and Germany in the coming days.Ukraine is hoping for permission to use two Western-supplied long range missiles that it already possesses to strike military targets such as airfields located deep inside Russian territory.Anticipation had been high last week ahead of meetings between President Joe Biden and Starmer in Washington, but no announcement on a decision was made.According to reports, the U.K. has already decided to grant Ukraine permission to use Storm Shadows to strike targets deep inside Russia but wants the backing of the U.S. and other countries.Starmer suggested last week the plan would be further discussed 'with a wider group of individuals' at the UN general assembly in New York later this month.The issue was on the agenda in Italy, where Starmer met with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. In a joint press conference, both leaders were asked about long-range missile strikes. Meloni said she supports the decision of allies to give Ukraine the go-ahead, adding that Italy is committed to ensuring Ukraine can enter peace negotiations with Russia in the 'very best conditions.'Starmer gave a broad answer, reiterating Ukraine's right to self-defense and reaffirming support in its 'fight for sovereignty.'The Russian targets that could be on Ukraine's long-range missile strike listIn recent weeks, Ukraine's hopes have been buoyed that its Western allies will finally allow their long-range weapons to strike deep into Russian territory.

Opinion: Life, death, and social solidarity in dark times	The following lecture was delivered in March 2023 at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy as part of a benefit conference to raise funds to support public outreach at Kyiv Mohyla Academy.The topic of my speech is: What is it like thinking in dark times? What does it mean? It is an echo of the podcast series I launched within our podcast, 'Explaining Ukraine,' one of the most widely listened-to podcasts in English about Ukraine. The idea was to not stop thinking, even during dark times.When I shared this idea with Marci Shore, a professor at Yale University, she asked: 'Does it refer to Hannah Arendt's book 'Men in Dark Times?'' I said: 'Yeah, I hadn't thought about this.' But there is indeed a reference: a parallel between our time and Arendt's reflections.For me, the idea of light is very interesting and important, and the idea of darkness as well. I do think that different epochs and times have certain relations to light and darkness. Some eras, like the Renaissance, Enlightenment, or the second half of the 20th century, were infused with the idea of light, transparency, and open space - an open perspective that brings everything to light. We have this notion that light is the norm, and darkness is a deviation.But there are other epochs, like the Baroque period in the 17th century or Romanticism in the 19th century, in which reflection starts from the opposite idea. It starts from the idea that darkness is our norm and light is an exception. Light rarely appears and can disappear quickly, so we should cherish it.One metaphor for this is found in Baroque painting: the chiaroscuro of Caravaggio, Rembrandt, van Honthorst, and Georges de La Tour. There is something in the emotion of this chiaroscuro: light emerging from and contrasting sharply with darkness. It is not just a painting technique; it carries an emotion that light is a rarity, a deficit. We actually start with the darkness, and inside the darkness, we start thinking.Opinion: State predation threatens to derail Ukraine's war effortRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has led to a resurgence in state predation against businesses, now approaching pre-EuroMaidan levels. This issue cannot be postponed until after the war. Politicized, predatory actions by law enforcement agencies against both domestic and fore...The Kyiv IndependentAlan RileyThis kind of thinking arises during difficult times. We understand how challenging the 16th and 17th centuries were for Europe, the early 19th century, or even the early 20th century in Europe, where we could also doubt that light is the norm.My first book in Ukrainian, for example, was dedicated to Walter Benjamin. I knew there was something in Benjamin that went beyond the interpretation of him that was popular at the time. That interpretation was very postmodernist: 'Let's look at Walter Benjamin as a sort of first deconstructionist, Derrida before Derrida.' I thought this was wrong because Benjamin was, for me, a Baroque thinker, a thinker of chiaroscuro, where truth is a deficit, a rarity, a kind of enlightenment through darkness.This is important, and we should not overlook it because many influential thinkers start thinking in dark times. We should probably think of Descartes as a Baroque philosopher who says: 'Look, we are in darkness, deceived by an evil genius, a bad spirit who plays with us.' We don't know the right path, so we must invent a method to get out of this place. Suddenly, we realize that Descartes' rationalist philosophy is actually more existential than we used to think.I think something is happening in Ukraine right now that we should pay attention to: this experience of facing a war, the fragility of life, and death, which is painful but might be the origin of thinking, literature, poetry, and art. The poetry now produced by Ukrainian poets is incredible. Writers like Serhii Zhadan, Halyna Kruk, Kateryna Kalytko, Kateryna Babkina, Julia Musakovska, Pavlo Korobchuk, and Svitlana Povalyaeva give us very strong poetry. This is more than poetry; it's strong literature. It's more than just words. It's existential. 'I think something is happening in Ukraine right now that we should pay attention to: this experience of facing a war, the fragility of life, and death, which is painful but might be the origin of thinking, literature, poetry, and art.' I hope the current epoch will give us an impetus for new thinking, reflection, and philosophy. I keep thinking about the basic concepts of philosophy. I hope this period will produce something new in Ukrainian philosophy, and maybe it already is.I also believe this time of war shows how important ideas are. I agree with Tim Snyder, who repeatedly says one cause of this war is bad ideas. I think we underestimate how bad ideas can kill people and how morally bad ideas can kill people. They are not innocent; they are not just words. Ukrainian freak-cabaret Dakh Daughters perform at The International Centre of Culture and Arts (October Palace) in Kyiv, Ukraine on April 26, 2024. (Yuri Gryaznov/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)For example, the idea that Russia is an empire that needs to expand, that Ukraine is a non-existent state, that the history of Ukraine is the history of Russia - these are bad ideas made by bad historians. But when bad history turns into ideology, it turns into a weapon. Once you say Ukraine does not exist or does not have a right to exist, the next step is to eliminate the idea of Ukraine and all the people who hold it. This is a direct step to genocide, which is happening right now. I think ideas play a big role in our lives and history. Ideas persist and go beyond the material reality of our daily existence, and we should be very attentive to ideas.There has been a devaluation of ideas in recent decades, both in Eastern Europe and the Western world. This may have something to do with postmodernism, or at least with the relativization of ideas, the thought that ideas are interchangeable. I think this is profoundly wrong, and we should pay attention to the power of ideas.For this lecture, I have been thinking about how the current situation leads us to rethink many things. I will try to share some thoughts about words and concepts that I have been rethinking since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.First, we need to rethink our idea of life. Life has become banal, particularly during peaceful times. But during war, when you face death and when death is no longer an abstract word, you understand how fragile life, society, our physical bodies, and culture are, how everything can be undone quickly, and how those who believe in the inevitable progress of history are wrong. Opinion: How Russian propaganda reached Venice's red carpetA film about Russian soldiers taking part in the war against Ukraine was recently presented at the Venice Film Festival. The film portrays ordinary people who care about their families, joke, and have doubts, fears, and dreams. Some fight to avenge a fallen comrade, some just to make money, whileThe Kyiv IndependentOleksandra MatviichukSeeing this is key. Of course, war is an absolute evil. But when you have no choice but to face war, death, and destruction, you realize how you can cherish life in a new way, how you can value living beings in a new way.One example is the attention Ukrainians now pay to the life of each person, and not just living people. There is an enormous amount of ritual around our dead soldiers. This change dates to as early as EuroMaidan. When a village buries its dead, every resident lines the streets for the procession. When famous people or heroes are killed, social networks talk about them. Recently, a prominent young Ukrainian soldier, known as DaVinci, died, and all of Ukraine talked about it. Life is fragile, but it's cherished.I recently returned from Nikopol, a town six kilometers from Russian troops, near the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest in Europe, which is occupied by the Russians. I met a woman named Olena, who takes care of a shelter for 250 pets despite regular shelling by the Russian army and the threat of a major nuclear disaster. We see over and over again how people care in these difficult times, and I think that's important.Another reflection on life is that life as a biological fact is not full if it is not filled with meaning, with values like freedom. As the famous Ukrainian paramedic Tyra, who spent a lot of time in Russian captivity, recently said: 'Life without freedom doesn't matter.' This brings us back to the old idea of dignity. If we go back to the idea of dignity in Roman times, we understand that dignity is the continuation of life beyond life. It's something non-material, something that goes beyond biology but is cherished no less than - or even more than - biological life.One story Ukraine is discussing is that of a Ukrainian soldier, a prisoner of war, who was told by Russian soldiers to dig his own grave and remove the Ukrainian symbols from his uniform. He refused, said, 'Glory to Ukraine,' and was shot on the spot. This dignity - the refusal to surrender identity even in the face of death - is something incredible. This is when the word dignity becomes very practical and material.A woman holds a candle during a minute of silence in Kyiv, Ukraine on Sep. 6, 2022, during a memorial 40 days after the Olenivka attack. (Dimitar Dilkoff / AFP via Getty Images)The second idea we need to rethink is death. Death is not a metaphor; it is not just a word. It was almost sick to see how the word death became popular in the 20th century. We talked about the death of culture, the death of modernity, the death of idealism, the death of metaphysics, and in all this, we played with the word death. It became less scary, something far away with which we could play.But for Ukrainians, death is not an abstract word: it's a physical death, a real death, a void when your loved ones die, when your husbands die, when your children die, when your friends die.The third concept we need to consider is evil - not just evil in the abstract or philosophical sense, such as Arendt's notion of the banality of evil, which has been validated by the current war, but something beyond that. The evil we are confronting in Ukraine is repetitive. It's an evil that has gone unpunished, unjudged, and uncondemned. This impunity forms a vicious cycle, granting evil the power to assert itself as a new norm. In such cases, those committing these atrocities begin to see themselves not as killers, but as judges - an insidious reversal of justice. This mentality is rooted in Russian history and the Soviet legacy, where figures like Putin inherit a tradition of unchecked violence by the KGB, committing atrocities without trial or accountability.The fourth idea that we need to take seriously is the notion that society is very important. We probably entered a period in developed democracies in which we have the illusion that we can all do it by ourselves. We are living increasingly in an atomistic society, where we believe that an individual can do everything. We don't need other people. Even if you're playing music, you don't need other players or other instruments, you can do everything on your computer. You can play video games by yourself; you can do everything by yourself. This is an illusion.Society may be less visible, but we all depend on our societies, we all depend on other people. We are wearing clothes, which other people made. We are reading books, which other people have written. We are using goods, which other people have produced. And if you remove that, if you remove this society, we will be helpless, we will not even be Robinson Crusoe, because we will not have those habits of survival. I think we tend to forget about this in this age of atomization. War actually brings you back to this notion that we can cherish our individual freedoms, we can cherish our individualities, but we are all connected to a wider network. And we will not survive without this network. And this network will not survive without us.Explainer: Ukraine's $15 billion IMF loan programMaxwell Kushnir is a research analyst at the IMF.

We are all so intertwined, and I think this idea gives you simultaneously a sense of responsibility and modesty. You understand that your effort, however important it might be, is just a drop in the ocean. And if there are no other drops, there is no ocean.The final point I want to make in this lecture is kind of connected with the first idea I mentioned. This war is of course a question of humanity. But at the same time, it's a question of going beyond humanity. It's also a war which leads us to think about life in wider terms. Humans are not the only ones suffering from this war. Animals are suffering, ecosystems are suffering. In many aspects, what Russia is doing is not only a genocide but also an ecocide. Look at how they set fire to Ukrainian fields, how they destroy our ecosystems in the South, which are so important for global food. We travel through Ukraine and we see these fields in which harvests were not collected because of the Russian invasion. We understand how long this supply chain is. And from the fact that the harvest was not collected last year, we realize that there are people all around the world who may face hunger or famine.This means we need to see the planet as a single organism in which everything depends on everything else, and in which, when we think about ethics of life, we should think beyond humans. That doesn't mean we should devalue humans, but we should understand that maybe one of the key ethical revolutions of the 21st century will be a revolution in which we extend the idea of dignity from humans to other living beings, to nature as such.I think Ukrainians have an implicit understanding of this idea, due to the impact of colonization and modernization. Death and famine were the result of Soviet colonization and industrial policy in the 1930s, for example. And it's clear that we are suffering from Russia's colonial aspirations and destructive technology today. So, I do think that the Ukrainian experience, including our experience of this war, can help us rethink our relation to nature as well.Editor's Note: This essay was originally published as part of a special issue of 'Studia Philosophica Estonica' entitled 'Reflections on the Russia-Ukraine War.'

Putin signs decree increasing number of military personnel, staff to 2.38 million	Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Sept. 16 increasing the number of the Russian Armed Forces from roughly 2.2 million to 2,389,130 people, including 1.5 million military personnel.The decree will take effect on Dec. 1, 2024, and will increase the total number of Russian military personnel and staff by 180,000. The last time the staffing level was increased was in December 2023. It amounted to 2,209,130 people, including 1,320,000 military personnel. In August 2022, six months after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine started, the number of personnel in the Russian Armed Forces increased to 1,150,628. The 2017 decree was in force at that time, according to which the staff should have been 1,013,628, a figure relevant at the time of the outbreak of full-scale war.Russia conscripted around 300,000 reservists during a limited mobilization in September 2022 but has sought to avoid a wide-sweeping draft, often targeting recruits from economically weaker regions or migrants.Ukraine believes that Russia continues to covertly recruit around 30,000 soldiers monthly, allowing the Russian military to balance out its losses.While Moscow does not publish its casualty figures, Kyiv believes that Russian losses have exceeded over 630,000 soldiers killed, wounded, or captured as of September.Putin delays new mobilization, despite Kursk incursion exposing troop shortagesAmid speculation that the Kremlin is considering a new mobilization of conscripts, some potential draftees say they are not enthusiastic about defending Russian territory just over a month after the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast.

Ukraine passed mobilization law a year too late, Polish FM Sikorski says	Ukraine adopted a law on mobilization at least one year too late, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said in an interview with European Pravda published on Sept. 15.Ukraine adopted the law in April as part of an effort to replenish the ranks of the Armed Forces. The need to increase the number of troops persists as Russia continues to advance in Donetsk Oblast and Ukraine opened a new front in Russia's Kursk Oblast.Sikorski said that the law should have been passed when there were 'many volunteers' to serve in the army and 'people felt personally threatened.' The minister also said he was surprised by the high number of military-aged Ukrainian men in Poland.'I go to a hairdresser in Warsaw, and a young Ukrainian barber cuts my hair. And I asked him: 'What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be defending your country?'' Sikorski said.The minister stressed that Poland does not pay social assistance to refugees who are able to work, adding that Western European governments are 'more generous.''The question is whether there should be financial incentives there (in the EU) rather than here (in Ukraine),' Sikorski said.The Ukrainian government has told its Polish counterparts that it wants Ukrainian citizens to return home to pay taxes and work at factories, the minister noted. 'But also, you need people to rotate those brave soldiers fighting at the front line,' he added.Recent legislation reforms pertaining to mobilization also included a law lowering the minimum age of compulsory military service from 27 to 25.After the new law on mobilization came into force in Ukraine on May 18, military-aged men were given 60 days to update their personal data so that the state could locate them. Between May 18 and the mid-July deadline, 4,690,496 military-aged men have done so, the country's Defense Ministry said.Ukraine's mobilization effort gets boost as millions update draft dataBy early 2024, 40-year-old Pavlo Kovtoniuk had begun to understand that Russia's two-year-long full-scale war against his country would require him to serve in the army sooner or later.

Russia continues to store ammunition, deploy troops at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Kyiv says	Russian forces continue to use the territory of the occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to deploy military personnel and store ammunition and explosives, Ukraine's National Resistance Center reported on Sept. 15.In a statement made less than two weeks after a visit by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director Rafael Grossi to the plant, the center criticized the IAEA for supposedly ignoring the presence of the military contingent and arms.The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power station, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. Its position near the front line has led to heightened nuclear safety risks throughout Russia's full-scale war.The facility houses Russia's National Guard units, totaling 1,300 people, the center said, citing data from Ukrainian citizens on the ground. The Akhmat-Grozny mobile special-purpose unit and special rapid response unit Agat were identified among the personnel stationed at the facility, according to the center run by Ukraine's special forces.As a disguise, some Russian troops allegedly wear the uniform of the plant's paramilitary guard rather than of the Russian National Guard.Explaining Russia's new nuclear doctrine —saber-rattling or real threat?The Kremlin on Sept. 4 said Russia would be adjusting its nuclear weapons doctrine in response to what it described as the 'challenges and threats, prompted by countries of the so-called collective West.' Accusing Western nations of 'rejecting dialogue,' ignoring Russia's security concerns, and inc...The Kyiv IndependentKateryna HodunovaRussian forces store small arms and artillery ammunition in the station's technical and basement areas to supply both the troops stationed at the plant and the forces at adjacent positions.Russia has also set up more than 20 minefields around the city of Enerhodar and the plant with a total length of about 6.5 km (nearly 4 miles) to prevent Ukrainian forces from crossing the Dnipro River, the center claimed.IAEA's Grossi made his fifth visit to the plant during the full-scale invasion on Sept. 4. He inspected various sections of the plant, including a pumping station and a nuclear fuel storage facility.Following the visit, Grossi said that a cooling tower at the facility would require demolition after a fire on Aug. 12 rendered the structure unusable. The fire did not pose a risk to nuclear safety at the plant.According to the center, Russian leadership controlling the facility planned the IAEA's route. This is not the first time the agency has been denied access to the western part of the two turbine halls.'However, the (IAEA's) representatives only recorded this fact and did not make any decision regarding the representatives of Rosatom, which manages the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant,' the statement read.The center also criticized the agency for supposedly ignoring the presence of the military contingent at the facility and the storage of ammunition and substances that endanger nuclear safety.Prior to his visit to the plant, Grossi visited the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant after Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of attempting to attack the plant amid the ongoing incursion in the area.

Ukraine to receive another batch of Danish F-16s this year, minister says	The Danish government promised to transfer another batch of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine later this year, the DR broadcaster reported on Sept. 15, citing Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen.'Denmark will deliver an additional contribution of F-16 aircraft in the second half of 2024,' Poulsen said in a comment to the Ritzau news agency after his visit to Kyiv.Ukraine received its first U.S.-made fourth-generation jets in late July, one year after Denmark, the Netherlands, and other foreign partners launched the fighter jet coalition for Kyiv.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen confirmed on Aug. 31 that these initial F-16s included aircraft from Denmark, while earlier reports suggested that the first batch was comprised of Dutch planes.Copenhagen has pledged to deliver 19 aircraft to Ukraine in total but did not disclose how many had already been provided. Poulsen did not name the size of the second batch either 'for the sake of operational security.'Kyiv has already deployed F-16s to intercept Russian mass aerial attacks. One aircraft crashed during such a mission, marking Ukraine's first F-16 loss.Ukraine was also promised 24 F-16s by the Netherlands, six by Norway, and 30 by Belgium.

Russia has launched over 640 Shahed-type drones at Ukraine in September, Zelensky says	Russian forces attacked Ukraine with more than 640 Shahed-type drones during the first half of September, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 16.Zelensky's statement comes after a recent Russian attack against nine oblasts and Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, with 56 Shahed-type drones. Fifty-three of them were reported as shot down, while the remaining three 'disappeared' from radar on Ukrainian territory. 'We are constantly working to make the Ukrainian air shield more effective. We are strengthening our Air Force, mobile fire groups, and all air defense units,' Zelensky wrote on his Telegram channel.Tehran has provided Moscow with thousands of Shahed kamikaze drones since the start of the all-out war. The U.S. confirmed on Sept. 10 that Iran has also supplied Russia with shipments of Fath-360 close-range ballistic missiles as a boost to Moscow's war against Ukraine.The U.S., the U.K., France, and Germany announced additional sanctions against Iran in response. The Iranian government has denied sending the weapons and criticized the sanctions.Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian is expected to attend the BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia, in October. Pezeshkian reportedly told Putin in July that Iran was prepared to enter 'a comprehensive strategic partnership' with Russia during the BRICS forum. Iran is one of Russia's closest allies.

Zelensky denounces apparent assassination attempt on Trump	Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sept. 16 denounced a recent apparent assassination attempt on U.S. presidential candidate and ex-President Donald Trump.'I am glad to hear that Donald Trump is safe and unharmed. My best wishes to him and his family,' Zelensky said on X.'It's good that the suspect in the assassination attempt was apprehended quickly. This is our principle: the rule of law is paramount and political violence has no place anywhere in the world.'The Secret Service on Sept. 15 opened fire after seeing an armed individual at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, while Trump was playing golf. Trump was unharmed, and the FBI is investigating the incident as another assassination attempt against the Republican presidential candidate.The suspect detained in connection to the attack was identified as 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh. Based on his social media activity, Routh has cast himself as a supporter of Ukraine and spoke to the New York Times in 2023 about a scheme to recruit Afghan soldiers to fight for Kyiv.It is unclear whether Routh managed to recruit any volunteers for Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify his claims.The International Legion for the Defense of Ukraine, a military unit composed of foreign volunteers, rejected any connections to Routh.'We would like to clarify that Ryan Wesley Routh has never been part of, associated with, or linked to the International Legion in any capacity,' the Legion said in a comment for Euronews.'Any claims or suggestions indicating otherwise are entirely inaccurate.'Trump was previously targeted in an assassination attempt on July 13 during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The incident sparked a wave of pro-Kremlin propaganda falsely blaming Democrats for the plot against Trump.There are fears that Routh's apparent support for Ukraine will likely further inflame Russian disinformation narratives ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Multiple reports indicated that Russia would seek to interfere in the upcoming vote by backing Trump and turning the American public against supporting Ukraine.Suspect detained in Trump assassination attempt claimed to support UkraineRyan Wesley Routh, the man detained in connection with the apparent assassination attempt of former U.S. President Donald Trump on Sept. 15, claimed to support Ukraine and used his social media platform to attempt to recruit Afghan soldiers to fight Russia's full-scale invasion.The Kyiv IndependentAbbey Fenbert	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-denounces-assassination-attempt-on-trump/	2024-09-16T02:40:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170949109.jpg
Poland will finance Czech artillery initiative for Ukraine, minister pledges amid delays	Warsaw will contribute to the Czech-led initiative to purchase artillery shells for Ukrainian forces in the future, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said in an interview with European Pravda published on Sept. 15.Sikorski's statement comes after news that Poland has not yet donated funds to the Czech initiative despite its promises. The minister confirmed that Warsaw has not yet participated in the project due to 'temporary formal obstacles.'Warsaw plans to allocate 50 million euros ($55.6 million) to the Czech initiative in 2024 and another 50 million euros in 2025, according to Sikorski.'But there are some technical, administrative, and legal issues related to the (Polish) State Agency for Strategic Reserves,' Sikorski said.'The (Polish) Foreign Ministry has done its part. I hope that colleagues from other ministries will also do theirs. It will definitely be done,' he added.Czechia unveiled its initiative to purchase artillery shells for Ukraine jointly with partners earlier this year amid shell shortages caused mainly by delays in U.S. assistance.Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky told the Kyiv Independent in July that the initiative had secured funds for 500,000 rounds and hopes to finance 300,000 more by the end of 2024. Eighteen countries have pledged support to the initial initiative, with 15 having fulfilled their promises and provided the funds, according to the minister.Prague is also preparing to launch a new initiative to purchase artillery ammunition for Ukraine in 2025, Czech Defense Minister Jana Cernochova said in an interview with the Denik N newspaper on July 24.18 Bohdana howitzers delivered to Ukraine, courtesy of Denmark — here's what they can doUkraine's artillery capabilities have received a welcome boost with the news that 18 domestically-made Bohdana howitzers financed by Denmark have been handed over to the Ukrainian military.

Ukraine invites UN, Red Cross to Kyiv-held part of Kursk Oblast	Ukraine invited the U.N. and the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) to 'join humanitarian efforts' in the Kyiv-held parts of Russia's Kursk Oblast, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Sept. 16.Sybiha instructed the ministry to send out the invitation during his official visit to Sumy Oblast on Sept. 15.Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in early August, reportedly seizing around 100 settlements and 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of territory. The Ukrainian positions in the region are now threatened by a Russian counterattack launched last week. 'Since the first day of the Kursk operation, Ukraine's Defense Forces demonstrated full adherence to international humanitarian law as a professional army with high standards and values of freedom and human life,' Sybiha said on X.'Ukraine is ready to facilitate their work and prove its adherence to international humanitarian law.'Kyiv previously said it would follow international humanitarian law during its conduct on Russian territory. Then-Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Aug. 14 that her office opened a '24-hour hotline for residents of Kursk Oblast who need humanitarian aid or want to evacuate to Ukraine.'The ICRC has come under criticism from Kyiv over its supposedly insufficient response to the humanitarian crisis sparked by Russia's war.

Latvia to supply Ukraine with British-made CVR(T) armored vehicles	Latvia will provide Ukraine with CVR(T) armored vehicles previously purchased from the U.K., the Delfi outlet reported on Sept. 15, citing the Latvian Defense Ministry.The vehicles' number and other details were not disclosed due to security concerns, Delfi wrote.The news comes shortly after Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silina announced a new military aid package for Ukraine, including armored personnel carriers.The CVR(T) (Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked)) is a British-designed armored vehicle family that entered service in the U.K. military in the 1970s. It exists in various variants and is capable of carrying out a wide range of tasks.Latvia operates at least 123 of these vehicles, namely Scimitar reconnaissance vehicles, Sultan command and control vehicles, Spartan armored personnel carriers, Samson armored recovery vehicles, and Samaritan ambulance vehicles.In 2019, the Latvian government signed a contract for over 80 more vehicles, though the number was later reduced to over 70.Latvian Defense Minister Andris Spruds recently said that the procurement of new vehicles to replace the CVR(T) is in its final stages.Latvia, one of Ukraine's biggest supporters, has committed to providing military support at the level of 0.25% of its GDP every year and will provide thousands of drones.The Russian targets that could be on Ukraine's long-range missile strike listIn recent weeks, Ukraine's hopes have been buoyed that its Western allies will finally allow their long-range weapons to strike deep into Russian territory.

I can exchange anyone, but not the Chechens who voluntarily surrendered,' Alaudinov said in a video address on his Telegram channel.Chechen units fighting on Russia's side were deployed in Kursk Oblast during Ukraine's surprise incursion launched in early August. A number of Chechen fighters ended up in Ukrainian captivity, while the Akhmat unit was accused by Russian milbloggers of offering little resistance when the incursion began.Alaudinov said it is necessary to secure the release of wounded Chechen captives, but those who surrendered without a fight should attempt suicide.'Chechens have always considered surrendering to captivity to be the greatest disgrace. Such a disgrace cannot be washed away with anything else but your blood,' Alaudinov said.'Just stand up, pick up something and attack somebody, do everything you can to get yourself killed.'The commander previously denied that Chechen fighters were captured during battles in Kursk Oblast.Russia launched a counterattack in Kursk Oblast last week in an effort to dislodge Ukrainian troops from the region.

Fugitive Ukrainian ex-MP Derkach appointed to Russian Senate	Russia's Astrakhan Oblast Governor Igor Babushkin appointed Andrii Derkach, a fugitive ex-member of Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada, as a senator, according to a Sept. 12 decree.Members of the Russian Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's parliament—unofficially called the Russian Senate — are not directly elected in a popular vote but are nominated by regional administrations. A region can send two representatives to the Senate: one proposed by the governor and approved by the regional legislature and another elected by the legislature itself.Derkach, who had been a Ukrainian lawmaker for nearly 20 years, had not attended meetings of the Ukrainian parliament since the start of the full-scale invasion. In 2023, his parliamentary powers were prematurely terminated.The U.S. government has called Derkach 'a Russian agent' and sanctioned him in 2022, accusing him of attempted election interference. Kyiv also imposed sanctions against the ex-lawmaker in 2021 and placed him on its wanted list.According to TASS, Derkach now lives in Astrakhan and has Russian citizenship. President Volodymyr Zelensky revoked Derkach's Ukrainian citizenship in January 2023.In 2022, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) exposed a Russian agent network in Ukraine, which included Derkach.Authorities said that the former lawmaker received funds from Russia's military intelligence agency (GRU) to create private security structures that Russia planned to use to capture Ukraine. Russia allocated $3-4 million every few months for the purpose, according to law enforcement.In 2023, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO) completed an investigation into suspected treason and illicit enrichment on Derkach's part.Derkach, a former member of the now-banned pro-Russian Party of Regions, received at least $567,000 from Russian law enforcement and intelligence agencies for subversive activities against Ukraine, NABU said.The politician was supposed to discredit the country at the international level, deteriorate diplomatic relations with the U.S., and hinder Ukraine's integration into the European Union and NATO, according to the investigation.Ukraine launches international search for controversial lawmaker Artem DmytrukThe State Bureau of Investigation previously confirmed on Aug. 26 that Dmytruk illegally crossed the border in Odesa Oblast and entered Moldova.The Kyiv IndependentThe Kyiv Independent news desk	https://kyivindependent.com/derkach-appointed-russian-senator/	2024-09-15T23:03:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/4128d52-------_690x387.png

Air defense repels mass drone attack against Kyiv	Ukrainian air defense units repelled a 'massive' Russian drone attack targeting Kyiv in the early hours of Sept. 16, according to Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration. The drone strike marked the eighth aerial attack against Kyiv this month, Popko said. The Air Force announced an aerial alert over Kyiv at around 2 a.m. local time on Sept. 16. The alert lasted for three and a half hours, according to Popko. Russia launched multiple groups of attack drones at Kyiv from different directions throughout the night.Air defense forces intercepted 'almost two dozen' unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over the city's airspace. There were no casualties or damage in Kyiv as a result of the attack, according to preliminary reports. An overnight drone strike against Kyiv on Sept. 7 damaged multiple residential buildings.

Suspect detained in Trump assassination attempt claimed to support Ukraine	Ryan Wesley Routh, the man detained in connection with the apparent assassination attempt of former U.S. President Donald Trump on Sept. 15, claimed to support Ukraine and used his social media platform to attempt to recruit Afghan soldiers to fight Russia's full-scale invasion. The Secret Service on Sept. 15 opened fire after seeing an armed individual at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. Trump was unharmed, and the FBI is investigating the incident as another assassination attempt against the Republican presidential candidate. Routh, 58, was taken into custody following the incident, according to law enforcement officers. He was detained by local law enforcement on the highway and was reportedly unarmed at the time of his arrest. Routh spoke to the New York Times (NYT) in 2023 about a scheme to recruit Afghan soldiers to fight in Ukraine. A former roofing contractor with no military experience, Routh used his Facebook account to appeal to conscripts in Afghanistan. 'Afghan Soldiers- Ukraine is somewhat interested in 3000 soldiers, so I need every soldier that has a passport to send me a copy of their passport to send to Ukraine,' Routh said in one such Facebook post, according to CNN. Shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Routh claimed on the social media platform X that he was ready to fight and die in the war against Russia. 'I AM WILLING TO FLY TO KRAKOW AND GO TO THE BORDER OF UKRAINE TO VOLUNTEER AND FIGHT AND DIE,' he said. It is unclear what actual support for Ukraine Routh provided apart from posts on social media. Routh told the NYT that he had traveled to Ukraine in 2022 and spent several months there. He also claimed to have met with the U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe to lobby for support for Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent could not confirm these claims at the time of publication. Routh's social media history reflects a grandiose sense of his own importance in political affairs. In a post on X in 2020, he invited North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to his home in Hawaii, offering his services as 'ambassador and liaison.' Trump was previously targeted in an assassination attempt on July 13 during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The incident sparked a wave of pro-Kremlin propaganda falsely blaming Democrats for the plot against Trump.Routh's apparent support for Ukraine will likely further inflame Russian disinformation narratives ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

Russian aircraft detected near Alaska for third time in 1 week	Two Russian IL-38 military aircraft were detected and tracked while operating in the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) on Sept. 14, marking the third such incident in one week, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) reported on Sept. 15. The Russian planes remained in international airspace and did not violate U.S. or Canadian airspace, NORAD reported. The flights are 'not seen as a threat.' Earlier in the week, NORAD on Sept. 11 said it detected two Russian military aircraft operating in the ADIZ. Two days later, the agency on Sept. 13 detected a pair of Russian Tu-142 military aircraft in the area. NORAD defines the ADIZ as a 'stretch of international airspace that requires the ready identification of all aircraft in the interest of national security.'Earlier this summer, the U.S. and Canada, which make up NORAD, scrambled fighter jets to intercept Russian and Chinese military planes in the ADIZ on July 25. NORAD in mid-August also detected and tracked four Russian warplanes flying in the ADIZ.According to NORAD, such incidences occur 'regularly.'

Jalali confirmed on Sept. 15 that Pezeshkian will attend the BRICS summit and meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Tehran and Moscow are expected to sign a bilateral cooperation agreement at the summit.Pezeshkian reportedly told Putin in July that Iran was prepared to enter 'a comprehensive strategic partnership' with Russia during the BRICS forum. Iran remains one of Russia's closest allies and a key weapons provider. The two nations have deepened their military and political cooperation since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.The U.S., U.K., France, and Germany announced additional sanctions against Iran after Washington confirmed reports that Tehran had shipped Fath-360 ballistic missiles to Moscow.

Trump safe after shots fired at golf course	Former U.S. President and current Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been reported safe following gunshots at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida on Sept. 15, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced. A man has been taken into custody and the FBI is investigating the incident as a possible assassination attempt against former President Trump. 'President Trump is safe following gunshots in his vicinity. No further details at this time,' Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement on Sept. 15. An armed individual reportedly opened fire at the course while Trump was golfing with with campaign donor Steve Witkoff. Authorities have not released the name of the detained suspect, and the suspect has not made any statements. U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed on the shooting and expressed relief for Trump's safety. 'I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America,' Harris wrote on X. The golf course shooting comes two months after an assassination attempt against Trump during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on July 13. Trump sustained injuries to his ear, and an audience member was killed. The July assassination attempt sparked a wave of Russian disinformation campaigns falsely blaming Democrats for the plot against Trump. The U.S. presidential election is less than two months away. American voters on Nov. 5 will choose between Trump and Harris after an election cycle marked by dramatic upheavals. Zelensky reveals details of July call with Trump, says he claimed to be 'very supportive''My position is that the election period and election messages are election messages. Sometimes they are not very real,' Zelensky said during a clip of the CNN interview, which is set to be fully published on Sept. 15.The Kyiv IndependentDmytro Basmat	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-safe-after-shots-fired-at-golf-course/	2024-09-15T14:47:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170949109.jpg

Warriors of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the National Guard of Ukraine, border guards, and police officers.''The vast majority of those released are people who had been held (in captivity) since the first days of the war,' said Ukraine's Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets in a statement.‌‌‌‌ Lubinets stressed that people who returned need serious rehabilitation, as their health has deteriorated severely during captivity.‌‌‌‌Previously, the United Nations commission published several reports describing the torture of Ukrainian POWs as 'widespread and systematic,' and the conditions of their detention as 'shocking.' Some Ukrainian POWs died in captivity from causes such as 'blunt force trauma'.This is the 57th prisoner exchange since the outbreak of the full-scale war, and the second exchange carried out in the last two days.Earlier on Sept. 13, 49 Ukrainian soldiers and civilians were released from Russian captivity. They included personnel of the Armed Forces, the National Guard, the National Police, and border guards.A total of 3,672 Ukrainians have been brought back from Russian captivity.Kyiv aims to conduct an all-for-all prisoner exchange, which was one of the subjects at Ukraine's peace summit in Switzerland in mid-June.At least 1 killed, 42 injured in Russian strike on high-rise in KharkivOne woman, 94, was killed, and 42 people were injured in a Russian air strike that hit a 12-story apartment building in Kharkiv and caused a fire, authorities reported on Sept. 15.Among the injured were three children, the youngest being one year old.President Volodymyr Zelensky shared photos of the damage on his Telegram channel, saying rescue operations were ongoing and that the fire had spread through the 9th through 12th floors.Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov said three children were among the initial estimated 25 injured. He later raised the toll to 35, and then to 42, and said that at least three were in serious condition. Twelve people were hospitalized, and more people are under the rubble, Syniehubov said.Police received a report of at least one missing person that could be under the rubble, said Ihor Klymenko, interior affairs minister.According to him, one of the building's residents refused to evacuate without his dog, so the State Emergency Service workers rescued both the man and his pet from the smoke-filled apartment on the 12th floor.The police set up an operational headquarters at the scene, with residents filing more than 30 reports of property damage, he said.At least 1,500 windows and dozens of cars were damaged, according to Syniehubov.Shortly before the reported strike, the city's mayor, Ihor Terekhov, warned that Russia had launched several KABs, or guided bombs.Russia launches counteroffensive in Kursk - can it push Ukraine off its own turf?More than a month after Ukraine launched an unprecedented incursion into Russian territory, Russian forces have begun counterattacking in Kursk Oblast, aiming to eventually drive Ukrainian troops out of the partially occupied border region.

He also emphasized that the aid shipments are slow to follow after partners pledge them.'During this 8-month pause before the positive decision of the U.S. Congress (to provide the $61-billion aid package last April) — what we did, everybody has to understand: We used everything we could,' Zelensky said.'We moved (to use) what we had in storages, and whatever the reserve brigades had - (those brigades that) we need now (to fight),' he added.Zelensky also defended the Ukrainian military command's decision to launch the Kursk incursion into Russia in August to divert Russian troops there, rather than keep Ukrainian forces in the eastern Pokrovsk direction, where Russian army was making relatively rapid territorial gains over the past weeks.Zelensky said that it didn't matter how many brigades were defending the east, if 'half of them is not equipped.' Specifically, he said they were lacking armored vehicles and artillery shells, as Russian forces fired 12 times more rounds than Ukrainian troops.Undistracted by Kursk offensive, Russia cuts deeper toward Pokrovsk in Donetsk OblastAs the world watched Ukraine's stunning cross-border offensive into Kursk Oblast, celebrating an unexpected blow to Moscow, Russian forces advanced with alarming speed in Ukraine's east. One month later, new front lines in the Russian border region formed in the wake of the Kursk incursion have beg...The Kyiv IndependentFrancis FarrellIn an earlier interview with Bloomberg on July 4, Zelensky said that 14 brigades in Ukraine's Armed forces remain unequipped with necessary weapons that the U.S. Congress already voted to send to Ukraine, but that are slow to come.He mentioned that these brigades could be used for Ukraine's counteroffensive if they had been properly equipped.'We have the desire (for a counteroffensive), but the tools have not come,' Zelensky told Bloomberg.In a BBC interview, Zelensky said that Russia launched 4,000 guided aerial bombs per month in the east of Ukraine, and destroyed 80% of the country's energy infrastructure, because the U.S. are hesitant to allow Ukraine to strike the airfields deep in the Russian territory, where the jets launching the bombs are stationed.'We waited too long,' he said, 'Russia is beginning to move these jets from 100-150 kms, 300 kms (distance from the Ukraine-controlled territory) to 500 kms.''After that, I will tell you, now we need more permissions,' Zelensky said.As of now, Ukraine doesn't have the permission from the U.S. to use the West-provided weapons to strike inside Russia, he addedRussia ramps up offensive on Vuhledar, Ukrainian stronghold in the eastWhile the Russian advance on Pokrovsk had slightly slowed down in recent days, Vuhledar, in the southern part of Donetsk Oblast, became a new focal point of the ongoing Russian offensive.

'Bild has not seen the victory plan, and of the few people who are currently involved by the president in the preparation of the Victory Plan, none of them spoke to Bild.''Ukraine is against any freezing of the war, and this is said at all levels of the Ukrainian leadership. And it is important for us that the United States supports Ukraine's Victory Plan, not capitulation or freezing,' Lytvyn said.He added that the United States would be the first partner presented with the plan.Officials have so far been tight-lipped about the plan's details.Last month, Zelensky said that Ukraine's operations in Kursk were part of his plan for victory.The other aspects of the plan include Ukraine's participation in the global security infrastructure, pressuring Russia to end the war through diplomatic means, and an economic aspect, Zelensky said without revealing further details.Ukraine is preparing for a second peace summit, following its inaugural global peace summit in Switzerland in June where Russia was excluded.Kyiv has said it aims to invite a Russian representative to the second conference.Kyiv has repeatedly rejected any ceasefire or temporary break in hostilities, saying it would only provide a window of opportunity for Russia to regroup its forces.The Russian targets that could be on Ukraine's long-range missile strike listIn recent weeks, Ukraine's hopes have been buoyed that its Western allies will finally allow their long-range weapons to strike deep into Russian territory. Since the beginning of the full-scale war, Russia has been able to attack Ukraine with relative impunity from its positions behind the border,...The Kyiv IndependentNate OstillerGermany won't allow long-range strikes on Russia even if other countries do, Scholz says‌‌Germany will not allow Ukraine to launch attacks with German weapons far behind the front 'even if other countries decide otherwise,' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said.His statement comes shortly after U.S. President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stopped short of lifting restrictions on using Western-supplied long-range weapons on Russian territory during their meeting in Washington on Sept. 13, while media continue to report on encouraging signs that the ban might be reversed.Scholz said during the public talk in Prenzlau, Brandenburg that Germany 'will continue to support Ukraine militarily' so that the country 'does not collapse,' German media Welt reported.However, Scholz stressed that he would remain opposed to the idea of Ukraine using German long-range weapons to attack targets deep inside Russia.'I am sticking to my position, even if other countries decide differently,' Scholz said.Commenting on media reports that the U.S. could lift the existing restrictions, he said that not all speculations are correct, according to Welt.Restrictions on the usage of U.S.-made and provided ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile System) are 'the subject of intense consultation among allies and partners, and will be (discussed) between President (Biden) and President Zelensky,' U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sept. 14.According to earlier media reports on Sept. 11, Biden was said to be finalizing the details of the plan to lift some restrictions, while the U.K. had reportedly privately decided to allow Ukraine to use its British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles for long-range strikes, though no public announcement had been made.Meanwhile, German media Spiegel reported on Sept. 13 that the debate is also ongoing inside the German parliament on whether Ukraine should be provided with German long-range missiles Taurus, with politicians from the FDP and the Greens supporting the decision.Ukraine has long been urging the West to lift the ban on striking military targets deep inside Russia.On Sept. 13, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his speech at the YES conference that without the ability to strike inside Russia, U.S.-provided ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) are 'pointless.'ATACMS restrictions subject of 'intense consultations' between Ukraine and allies, Sullivan saysAllowing Ukraine to use ATACMS to strike targets deep inside Russia is the subject of 'intense consultations,' U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, said on Sept. 14.Speaking at the Yalta European Strategy conference in Kyiv, Sullivan reiterated that no decision had yet been made, a day after U.S. President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer met in Washington to discuss the issue.Ukraine had been hoping for permission to be granted during the talks to use two Western-supplied long-range missiles - Storm Shadow and ATACMS - to strike military targets such as airfields located deep inside Russian territory.But Starmer left Washington with no such announcement being made, putting Kyiv's hopes on hold once again.'I understand Ukraine's perspective on it,' Sullivan said, adding: 'But rather than me trying to elaborate on the reasoning one way or the other, this is something that I think is the subject of intense consultation among allies and partners, and will be (discussed) between President (Biden) and President Zelensky.'Zelensky is due to travel to New York later this month for the United Nations General Assembly.Speaking at the same conference a day earlier, Zelensky said the U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles are 'pointless' in Ukraine due to their limited quantity and restrictions on strikes deep inside Russia imposed by Western partners.The U.S. began providing Ukraine with Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), which have a range of up to 300 kilometers (190 miles), in the spring.While these missiles have been used in Russian-occupied Crimea, Washington's restrictions prevent their use on Russian soil.'ATACMS in the form that we have today (in Ukraine) is pointless if you cannot use it on their (Russian) military bases, airfields with helicopters and airplanes. It's pointless,' Zelensky said.'If ATACMS has a big restriction on the use of missiles because there are few of them... Unfortunately, it doesn't work.'The NYT reported that it's likely a decision will be made about Storm Shadows before one is reached over ATACMS.While Ukraine has been pleading for permission for months, it's understood the stance of Western nations has changed in light of Iran supplying Russia with ballistic missiles.'We've now seen this action of Russia acquiring ballistic missiles from Iran, which will further empower their aggression in Ukraine. So if anyone is taking escalatory action, it would appear to be Mr. Putin and Russia,' U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy, said while visiting Kyiv earlier this week.Lammy added that Iran supplying ballistic missiles to Russia 'clearly changes the debate' around the issue, as it allows the Kremlin to gain 'further penetration into Ukraine.'Zelensky is also expected to present Biden with a plan for Ukraine's victory against Russia, which will also be presented to Vice President Kamala Harris and ex-President Donald Trump, the two candidates for the upcoming November presidential election.'I do think we need a comprehensive strategy for success in this war and that is what President Zelensky says he's bringing,' Sullivan said.'And so we're very much looking forward to sitting down and talking that through, and President Biden is eager for that conversation.'And it's only right that it be President Zelensky who brings that because it is up to the democratically elected government of Ukraine and the people of Ukraine to set out the course of the war, their path to victory.'Ukraine's long-range missile strike hopes on hold once again but encouraging signs remainUkraine's hopes of being allowed to use Western-supplied long range missiles to strike deep inside Russian territory were put on hold once again on Sept. 13, after the leaders of the U.S. and U.K. stopped short of making the announcement Kyiv wanted. Anticipation had been high ahead ofThe Kyiv IndependentChris YorkUkraine launched production of 155-mm artillery shells, official saysUkraine already produces its own 155 mm artillery ammunition, said Alexander Kamyshin, newly appointed by President Zelensky as external adviser for strategic issues.Kamyshin, who resigned from his post as Strategic Industries Minister during the biggest wartime government reshuffle on Sept. 4, told Norwegian media Nettavisen that Ukraine's production of defense material doubled under his leadership.'By the end of the year, it will have tripled. We continue to drive on,' Kamyshin added.Ukraine has long tried to ramp up domestic ammunition production to become more independent from Western partners. In the summer of 2023, Ukroboronprom said that it had already mastered the production of 82 mm mortar mines, 122 mm, and 152 mm artillery rounds, as well as 125 mm tank shells.Earlier media reports cited Ukrainian officials hoping to begin producing 'desperately needed' NATO-standard 155 mm artillery rounds in the 'second half' of 2024 at the earliest.'This is a very complicated process. This is something that Ukraine has never done before,' Kamyshin said, adding that he 'can't say much' on the matter.Despite domestic efforts, the Ukrainian army still mainly depends on supplying 155 mm shells from partners, as European countries join forces to buy the rounds outside Europe.The U.S. also opened a new factory last May to produce 155 mm munitions for Ukraine and significantly increased production in some existing factories.Russian cities left defenseless as Ukraine ramps up drone attacksWhile waiting for a green light from Western countries to use their long-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia, Ukraine is relying on domestically produced drones, which are considerably cheaper than missiles and no less effective.

Ukraine offers neighbor countries help with deadly floods	Ukraine has offered to send its emergency service units to neighboring Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to help overcome the ongoing floods.Ukraine's newly appointed Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on social media that he offered help to the neighbor countries as instructed by President Volodymyr Zelensky, in coordination with Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal.Several European countries are dealing with severe floods caused by the heaviest rainfall in years, according to media reports. The floods had claimed at least seven lives, as thousands of houses were damaged accross Europe, with tens of thousands of people forced to evacuate from the disaster areas.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said he was moved by Ukraine's offer of help.'A moment ago, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal sent me expressions of solidarity with Poland and readiness to immediately send a hundred rescuers equipped with specialist equipment to fight the flood. Moving,' Tusk said on X.Czech Republic Foreign affairs minister Jan Lipavský confirmed the offer in a statement on X (Twitter). 'I will convey the offer at an emergency cabinet meeting,' Lipavský wrote.Ukraine has also suffered from a major humanitarian disaster caused by flooding after the Russian forces destroyed the Kakhovka dam in Ukraine's south on July 6, 2023, which Zelensky called one of Russia's 'most serious crimes against the environment and people.'In the Ukrainian-controlled part of the area flooded after the dam's destruction, emergency service rescuers and volunteers evacuated thousands of locals, even under heavy shelling from Russian forces.Since the start of the Russian full-scale invasion, Ukraine has sent its emergency service workers on a mission abroad at least once: to help Turkey after a deadly earthquake hit it on Feb. 6, 2023, claiming over 50,000 lives across Turkey and Syria.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-offers-neighbor-countries-help-with-deadly-floods/	2024-09-15T12:47:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2171350835.jpg

The Russian targets that could be on Ukraine's long-range missile strike list	In recent weeks, Ukraine's hopes have been buoyed that its Western allies will finally allow their long-range weapons to strike deep into Russian territory. Since the beginning of the full-scale war, Russia has been able to attack Ukraine with relative impunity from its positions behind the border, while the U.S. and other suppliers of weapons have forbidden Ukraine from using their supplied weapons to strike back, often citing fears of escalation. There were signs that the tide was shifting over the past week. The Guardian reported that the U.K. had already decided to allow Ukraine to use its Storm Shadow missiles for strikes in Russia. Politico wrote that the White House reportedly is discussing potential targets Ukraine could strike with its long-range weapons.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken (L) and Britain's Foreign Secretary David Lammy (R) pose with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky (C) at the Mariinsky Palace in Kyiv, Ukraine on Sep. 11, 2024, amid the Russian invasion on Ukraine. (Mark Schiefelbein / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)But hopes of a positive announcement during meetings between President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Washington on Sept. 13 were dashed, and the decision-making process appears to have been postponed to the UN general assembly in New York later this month.A day later on Sept. 13 in Kyiv, U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said allowing Ukraine to use ATACMS to strike targets deep inside Russia is the subject of 'intense consultations.' Ukraine has been eagerly awaiting the potential lifting of restrictions, with Defense Minister Rustem Umerov saying in August that he had presented the U.S. with a list of proposed targets within Russia. Calling the lifting of restrictions a 'game changer is probably too strong a word,' Andreas Umland, analyst at the Stockholm Center for Eastern European Studies, told the Kyiv Independent.'But it would make a big difference of course. That's why the Ukrainians are so eager to get it.'Potential targetsA public list of targets — either those requested by Ukraine or approved by the U.S. or the U.K. — is unlikely for operational reasons. Western officials have been hesitant to openly talk about policy changes, likely out of concern that Russia will relocate potentially valuable targets out of reach before Ukraine is able to capitalize on its newfound range capabilities.But matching the ranges of the weapons available to Ukraine, to Russian positions on the other side of the border can shed light on what might be possible should the policy be officially changed. A report from the Institute for the Study of War last month identified 'no fewer than 245 known Russian military and paramilitary sites' within the 300-kilometer range of U.S.-supplied ATACMS, which is currently the furthest range of any Western-supplied missiles available to Ukraine. A map based on data from an Institute for the Study of War (ISW) report on Aug. 27, 2024, which using open-source data, identified 'no fewer than 245 known Russian military and paramilitary objects' within the 300-kilometer range of U.S.-supplied ATACMS, including air bases, headquarters, and training centers. (Institute for the Study of War/ Nizar Al-Rifai/ The Kyiv Independent)If placed close to Ukraine's front lines, the Western-supplied long-range weapons could potentially put vast swathes of Russian territory in the firing zone. The area includes military bases, airfields, troop concentrations, and ammunition depots.Numerous population centers would also be in range, including the cities of Rostov-on-Don (population 1.1 million), Voronezh (population 1 million), Krasnodar (population 1.1 million), Lipetsk (population 496,000), Bryansk (population 350,000), Smolensk (population 310,000), as well as the key port city of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea (population 262,000). This non-exhaustive list does not include cities in occupied Crimea or other parts of Ukraine under Russian control or cities in Russia that have already reportedly come under Ukrainian attack, such as Belgorod. Any change in policies is likely to come with strings attached and with the understanding that long-range strikes will be conducted in a defensive fashion on military targets. Some of the possible military targets in this area could include the following:Lipetsk military air base, struck by drones in AugustShatalovo air base in Smolensk OblastMillerovo military airfield in Rostov Oblast, damaged in a drone strike in JulyYeysk military airfield in Krasnodar Krai, damaged in drone strikes in June and AprilLogistics and command centers in Rostov-on-Don, which has been the central headquarters of Russia's full-scale invasion of UkraineThe Primorsko-Akhtarsk airbase in Krasnodar Krai, regularly used by Russia to launch Shahed-type drones at UkraineNovorossiysk naval base, where much of Russia's Black Sea Fleet has relocated after a series of devastating attacks by Ukraine on its primary base off of occupied CrimeaA damaged car is seen at an undisclosed location in Russia's Belgorod Oblast overnight on Sept. 1, 2024 following a drone attack.

HIMARS, whose prowess became a popular motif of internet memes, was a game-changer for Ukraine when they first arrived in the summer of 2022.Initially supplied with GMLRS rockets with a range of around 70 kilometers, they allowed Ukraine to target Russian forces on the other side of the front line far more accurately than they had previously.In the fall of 2023, the U.S. began supplying Kyiv with an older model of ATACMS - fired from HIMARS launchers - with a range of around 165 kilometers, greatly increasing the range that Ukraine could strike within.Ukrainian drones strike deeper into Russia, aiming to break war machine, sow discontentJust before sunrise on an otherwise sleepy weekend near Moscow, a Russian eyewitness of Ukraine's kamikaze drone attack on the Kashira Power Plant appeared stunned, unleashing an expletive-laden tirade with his wife alongside.

As the West dithered on its policy about long-range strikes, Ukraine has developed its own domestic arsenal of drones to attack targets inside Russia, hitting airbases, ammunition dumps, drone factories, and other military sites as far as 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) beyond the Ukrainian border. The U.S. began supplying Ukraine with an older model of the Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) in the fall of 2023, which have a range of around 165 kilometers. In the spring of 2024, the New York Times reported that the U.S. had shipped around 100 updated versions of ATACMS missiles, which can reach up to 300 kilometers. Illustrative photo.

The missiles have been deployed in a number of devastating attacks on Russian targets, such as a strike on the Black Sea Fleet headquarters in occupied Crimea that reportedly killed dozens of Russian soldiers and officers. Although its official list of targets has not been revealed, Ukraine has repeatedly stated that it needs the ability to strike the Russian aircraft that launch mass missile attacks against Ukrainian cities, and the airfields from which they take off.'The Storm Shadow is best used against heavily protected buildings like bunkers or reinforced ammunition storage sites and headquarters,' Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), told the Kyiv Independent, adding: 'It isn't the best use of it to try and hit aircraft out on a runway, or against an airfield that is easy to repair.' 'There are such targets available in Russia, but they'll need to be carefully picked to maximize the impact, ideally timed to coincide with Ukrainian ground operations, destroying supplies that Russian ground units need.'Savill said that the cluster weapon version of ATACMS is ideally suited to striking Russian aircraft at Russian airfields, but added that a recent report that Moscow has already transferred around 90% of its military aircraft to bases outside their reach suggests their effect may now be limited.'This at least means (Russian aircraft) have to operate from further away, and can fly fewer sorties per day,' he said.'There will be Russian forces still in ATACMS range, but essentially it sounds as if the opportunity to do serious damage to the Russian air force on the ground has been missed, for now.'Despite potential missed opportunities, the lifting of restrictions will still be welcomed in Ukraine.'It will certainly make a lot of difference in the war, and will help protect Ukrainian cities from these ongoing missile terror attacks,' Umland said.Russian cities left defenseless as Ukraine ramps up drone attacksWhile waiting for a green light from Western countries to use their long-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia, Ukraine is relying on domestically produced drones, which are considerably cheaper than missiles and no less effective.

Ukrainian military to launch new project in coming months to improve basic training, Syrskyi says	Ukraine is working to improve the training quality for its military, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi announced on Sept. 15, and will roll out new plans over October and November. In a recent working meeting with military leaders and authorities responsible for military training, the group discussed problems related to military training and discussed strategies to solve them, Syrskyi said in a post on Facebook. 'Instructors play a key role in the quality of training. Therefore, we pay maximum attention to attracting motivated instructors with combat experience. We are also working on the possibility of creating an instructor school, which will be the main and only source of well-trained instructors,' Syrskyi wrote. 'We are working on increasing the term of basic combined military training. The corresponding project will be started in October-November of this year,' he added.In July, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the military suffered from a lack of training facilities for new soldiers, citing the Ukrainian military. 'Considering training facilities, there are not enough of them. They are already being expanded,' Zelensky said. Ukraine's parliament adopted an updated mobilization law in mid-April to ramp up mobilization amid Russia's ongoing war. The new law simplifies the process for identifying eligible conscripts and includes additional penalties for those dodging the draft and came into force on May 18.

Russian strike on high-rise in Kharkiv leaves at least 33 injured	Editor's note: This is a developing story.At least 33 people including three children were injured when a Russian air strike hit a high-rise building in Kharkiv city and caused a fire, authorities reported on Sept. 15.President Volodomyry Zelensky shared photos of the damage on his Telegram channel, saying rescue operations where ongoing and that the fire had spread through the 9th through 12th floors. Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Synehubov said three children were among the estimated 25 injured, with the city's mayor, Ihor Terekhov later raising the known total to 33 injured. Shortly before the reported strike, Terekhov warned that Russia had launched several KABs, or guided bombs.

Media: Cyprus revokes citizenship of Ukrainian oligarch Kolomoisky	Cyrpus has stripped Ihor Kolomoisky's Cyrpus citizenship after concluding that the notorious Ukrainian oligarch had withheld vital information related to criminal charges he faces, Philenews reported. Kolomoisky, who was arrested last year in Ukraine, faces trial for alleged fraud, illegal acquisition of property, and money laundering related to his oil and gas holdings. The Prosecutor General's Office announced in May that Kolomoisky was also suspected of ordering the murder of the head of a law firm more than 20 years ago in Crimea.After reviewing the personal information submitted by Kolomoisky to obtain his citizenship under the so-called 'Golden Passport' program, which allows wealthy investors to obtain citizenship through financial investments, the E.U. country determined earlier this month that Kolomoisky's 'suspicious character' risked worsening Cyrpus's reputation, Philenews wrote. Ukraine's Bureau of Economic Security reported that it completed its pre-trial investigation into Kolomoisky on Aug. 21. The prosecutors said that part of the money Kolomoisky allegedly embezzled and transferred to his account, some Hr 2 billion ($48 million), was obtained at the expense of loans from PrivatBank, a Ukrainian bank formerly owned by Kolomoisky.The bureau also said its detectives proved that Kolomoisky had organized the illegal seizure of more than Hr 3.3 billion ($ 80 million) from Ukrnafta, Ukraine's largest oil producer previously affiliated with the oligarch.Kolomoisky, together with five associates, was charged by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) with embezzling Hr 9.2 billion ($223 million) from PrivatBank, the NABU announced on Sept. 7, 2024.Seven other wealthy individuals also lost their citizenship as part of the same review by Cyrpus authorities of personal data submitted during citizenship applications.

Zelensky's office denies report that victory plan includes ceasefire along existing lines	An advisor for President Volodymyr Zelensky denied a news report suggesting Zelensky's new victory plan will include a partial ceasefire, calling it a 'fake.' Zelensky has said he will present the United States with a plan for Ukraine's victory later this month during a meeting with Biden. Responding on Sept. 15 to an article published by Germany's Bild newspaper, Presidential Communications Advisor Dmytro Lytvyn told Ukrainska Pravda, that the claim was untrue.'Bild spread a fake,' Lytvyn said. 'Bild has not seen the victory plan, and of the few people who are currently involved by the president in the preparation of the Victory Plan, none of them spoke to Bild.''Ukraine is against any freezing of the war, and this is said at all levels of the Ukrainian leadership. And it is important for us that the United States supports Ukraine's Victory Plan, not capitulation or freezing,' Lytvyn said. He added that the United States would be the first partner presented with the plan. Officials have so far been tight-lipped about the plan's details. Last month, Zelensky said that Ukraine's operations in Kursk were part of his plan for victory.The other aspects of the plan include Ukraine's participation in the global security infrastructure, pressuring Russia to end the war through diplomatic means, and an economic aspect, Zelensky said without revealing further details.Ukraine is preparing for a second peace summit, following its inaugural global peace summit in Switzerland in June where Russia was excluded.

Russians' faith in their country's safety 'broken' by Ukraine's deep strikes, Budanov says	Ukraine's strikes deep into Russian territory have 'broken' the faith Russian people hold that their country is powerful and safe, Ukraine's military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said on Sept. 14.Speaking during the 20th annual Yalta European Strategy (YES) meeting in Kyiv, Budanov said the strikes have had a 'serious effect on the social-psychological situation,' adding that 'the (Russian) people's belief in that they live in a safe country has been broken. It is the main achievement of all these deep strikes.''The comments come amid intense debate between Ukraine and its allies over the issue of allowing Ukraine to strike Russian territory with foreign-provided weapons. Ukraine has for months requested permission to use foreign weapons to strike within Russian territory, but many partners including the U.S. and Germany have refused over fears of escalation. Ukraine has instead used domestically-produced drones to target Russian cities in mass attacks, ramping up these attacks in recent weeks. The U.S. began providing Ukraine with Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), which have a range of up to 300 kilometers (190 miles), in the spring.While these missiles have been used in Russian-occupied Crimea, Washington's restrictions prevent their use on Russian soil.However, it's understood the stance of Western nations has changed in light of Iran supplying Russia with ballistic missiles, with some reports that the U.K. has already decided to grant Ukraine permission to use Storm Shadows to strike targets deep inside Russia.At the summit, Budanov also expressed concern about North Korea's supply of ballistic missiles to Russia and predicted that Russia may be forced to conduct another wave of mobilization in summer 2025.

Ukrainian military receives 18 Bohdana howitzers financed by Denmark	The Ukrainian military has been handed the 18 Ukrainian-made Bohdana self-propelled howitzers financed by Denmark, Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen announced.Mountable on a number of different truck chassis setups, the Bohdana is the first Ukrainian-made artillery piece to be manufactured in the 155mm NATO-standard caliber.Poulsen made his remarks on Sept. 14 during the 20th annual Yalta European Strategy (YES) meeting in Kyiv, according to the news outlet RBC-Ukraine. The minister added that producing weapons domestically in Ukraine is cheaper and more efficient than in the West, and called on other European countries to do the same. Kyiv has sought to convince allied countries to donate arms to Ukraine's military via direct purchases from Ukrainian companies, as Kyiv's defense budget does not match the capacities of domestic weapons production. A self-propelled howitzer can drive into position, fire off multiple rounds in under a minute, and be out of range of counterfire before the enemy has had time to organize, giving it a speed advantage over artillery units that are towed into place. In development for years before the outset of the full-scale invasion, the Bohdana was first used in combat in summer 2022, firing upon Russian positions on Snake Island in the Black Sea.The order for the 18 Bohdana artillery units was placed in July of this year. In July, the Strategic Industries Ministry said that foreign partners had so far pledged to invest around $675 million in the Ukrainian defense industry to arm Kyiv's forces. 18 Bohdana howitzers heading for Ukraine's battlefield - here's what they can doUkraine's artillery capabilities have received a welcome boost with the news that 18 Ukrainian-made Bohdana howitzers financed by Denmark will be delivered within the coming months.

Netherlands unable to fulfill complete Patriot delivery after unnamed partner backs out, media reports	An agreement for the Netherlands to provide Ukraine with a full Patriot air defense system has fallen through after an unnamed ally working with the country backed out, local media reported. In June, the Netherlands announced that it would provide radar and launch components for a Patriot system, and that it had found another country to provide the additional necessary parts. The radar components provided by the Netherlands were recently transferred, NL Times reported on Sept 13., but it is still in discussions to find the remaining parts from other countries.

Russia says it was attacked by 29 Ukrainian drones overnight	Russia's Defense Ministry said on Sept. 15 that it was attacked by 29 Ukrainian drones overnight and that all of them were shot down. The Kyiv Independent was not able to independently verify the statement. The Ukrainian government has not commented on the alleged attack. According to Russia's Defense Ministry, which posted its statement on Telegram, fifteen of the drones were shot down over Bryansk Oblast, five over Kursk, four over Smolensk, two over Oryol, and one each over Belgorod, Kaluga, and Rostov Oblasts. In recent months, Kyiv stepped up its number of drone attacks against Russian infrastructure facilities and military installations, hoping to undermine Russian invasion forces in Ukraine.Earlier in the week, Moscow claimed that Ukraine had attacked overnight with 144 drones, making the attack potentially among the largest strikes throughout the war.

Biden administration requests extension of nearly $6 billion military funding for Ukraine	U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has requested Congress to extend the authority of 'presidential write-offs' for supplying weapons to Ukraine until 2025, so that the remaining $5.8 billion can be used beyond the fiscal year ending on September 30.Under current rules, the funds will expire if not used by that deadline.The Pentagon is working with Congress to ensure the extension, which would allow continued military aid to Ukraine.If the extension isn't granted, the White House may announce a large aid package by October 1, but this approach could present logistical challenges, such as lack of available resources.Additionally, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken recently announced over $700 million in aid to Ukraine during his visit to Kyiv.The U.S. will provide $325 million to help repair Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which requires strengthening ahead of winter and expectations of a renewed campaign of Russian strikes.The package also includes $290 million in humanitarian aid, which will support 'millions of people in Ukraine and the surrounding region who have been forced to flee their homes,' Blinken said.ATACMS restrictions subject of 'intense consultations' between Ukraine and allies, Sullivan saysATACMS restrictions are 'the subject of intense consultation among allies and partners, and will be (discussed) between President (Biden) and President Zelensky,' U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said.The Kyiv IndependentThe Kyiv Independent news desk	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-administration-requests-extension-of-5-8-billion-military-funding-for-ukraine/	2024-09-14T20:23:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/ezgif-1-86d0505a8b.jpg
Budanov discusses Russia's strategy and North Korean involvement at YES meeting in Kyiv	Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine's military intelligence chief, delivered multiple statements during the 20th annual Yalta European Strategy (YES) meeting in Kyiv.Budanov expressed concern over North Korea's significant military support to Russia, particularly its supply of ballistic missiles.When asked to rank the countries offering the most military support to Russia, Budanov placed North Korea at the top, stating that 'North Korea would be first, then there is no one for a long time, and then everyone else,' highlighting the unmatched volume of supplies North Korea provides.He added that Russia has significantly ramped up its missile production, including Iskander missiles and guided aerial bombs.In another interview, Budanov said that Russia aims to end the war by the end of 2025 or early 2026, due to expected economic and social crises.He noted that by summer 2025, Russia will face serious economic problems and may be forced into further mobilization.'They (Russia) predict that around the summer of 2025, the negative impact on the economy will be very noticeable for their country,' Budanov said. In February 2024, U.S. intelligence estimated that since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Russia has spent up to $211 billion on military operations in Ukraine. The war has cost Russia up to $1.3 trillion in lost economic growth through 2026, an undisclosed source in U.S. intelligence in a comment to Reuters.NATO could have done more to stop Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Stoltenberg saysStoltenberg said the day the war was launched was the worst in his 10-year stint in the role, from which he is stepping down next month.The Kyiv IndependentThe Kyiv Independent news desk	https://kyivindependent.com/budanov-discusses-russias-strategy-and-north-korean-involvement-at-yes-meeting-in-kyiv/	2024-09-14T17:06:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2037956412.jpg
Ukraine launched production of 155-mm artillery shells, official says	Ukraine already produces its own 155 mm artillery ammunition, said Oleksandr Kamyshin, newly appointed by President Zelensky as external adviser for strategic issues.Kamishyn, who resigned from his post as Strategic Industries Minister during the biggest wartime government reshuffle on Sept. 4, told Norwegian media Nettavisen that Ukraine's production of defense material doubled under his leadership.'By the end of the year, it will have tripled. We continue to drive on,' Kamishyn added.Ukraine has long tried to ramp up domestic ammunition production to become more independent from Western partners. In the summer of 2023, Ukroboronprom said that it had already mastered the production of 82 mm mortar mines, 122 mm, and 152 mm artillery rounds, as well as 125 mm tank shells.Earlier media reports cited Ukrainian officials hoping to begin producing 'desperately needed' NATO-standard 155 mm artillery rounds in the 'second half' of 2024 at the earliest.'This is a very complicated process. This is something that Ukraine has never done before,' Kamyshin said, adding that he 'can't say much' on the matter.Despite domestic efforts, the Ukrainian army still mainly depends on supplying 155 mm shells from partners, as European countries join forces to buy the rounds outside Europe.The U.S. also opened a new factory last May to produce 155 mm munitions for Ukraine and significantly increased production in some existing factories.ATACMS restrictions subject of 'intense consultations' between Ukraine and allies, Sullivan saysATACMS restrictions are 'the subject of intense consultation among allies and partners, and will be (discussed) between President (Biden) and President Zelensky,' U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said.The Kyiv IndependentThe Kyiv Independent news desk	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-launched-production-of-155-mm-artillery-shells-official-says/	2024-09-14T15:06:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/nammo-8.jpg
Germany won't allow long-range strikes on Russia even if other countries do, Scholz says	Germany will not allow Ukraine to launch attacks with German weapons far behind the front 'even if other countries decide otherwise,' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said.His statement comes shortly after U.S. President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stopped short of lifting restrictions on using Western-supplied long-range weapons on Russian territory during their meeting in Washington on Sept. 13, while media continue to report on encouraging signs that the ban might be reversed.Scholz said during the public talk in Prenzlau, Brandenburg that Germany 'will continue to support Ukraine militarily' so that the country 'does not collapse,' German media Welt reported.However, Scholz stressed that he would remain opposed to the idea of Ukraine using German long-range weapons to attack targets deep inside Russia. 'I am sticking to my position, even if other countries decide differently,' Scholz said.Commenting on media reports that the U.S. could lift the existing restrictions, he said that not all speculations are correct, according to Welt.Restrictions on the usage of U.S.-made and provided ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile System) are 'the subject of intense consultation among allies and partners, and will be (discussed) between President (Biden) and President Zelensky,' U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sept. 14.According to earlier media reports on Sept. 11, Biden was said to be finalizing the details of the plan to lift some restrictions, while the U.K. had reportedly privately decided to allow Ukraine to use its British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles for long-range strikes, though no public announcement had been made.Meanwhile, German media Spiegel reported on Sept. 13 that the debate is also ongoing inside the German parliament on whether Ukraine should be provided with German long-range missiles Taurus, with politicians from the FDP and the Greens supporting the decision. Ukraine has long been urging the West to lift the ban on striking military targets deep inside Russia. On Sept. 13, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his speech at the YES conference that without the ability to strike inside Russia, U.S.-provided ATACAMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) are 'pointless.'ATACMS restrictions subject of 'intense consultations' between Ukraine and allies, Sullivan saysATACMS restrictions are 'the subject of intense consultation among allies and partners, and will be (discussed) between President (Biden) and President Zelensky,' U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said.The Kyiv IndependentThe Kyiv Independent news desk	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-wont-allow-long-range-strikes-on-russia-even-if-other-countries-do-scholz-says/	2024-09-14T12:32:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1834521425.jpeg
ATACMS restrictions subject of 'intense consultations' between Ukraine and allies, Sullivan says	Allowing Ukraine to use ATACMS to strike targets deep inside Russia is the subject of 'intense consultations,' U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, said on Sept. 14.Speaking at the Yalta European Strategy conference in Kyiv, Sullivan reiterated that no decision had yet been made, a day after President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer met in Washington to discuss the issue.Ukraine had been hoping for permission to be granted during the talks to use two Western-supplied long-range missiles - Storm Shadow and ATACMS - to strike military targets such as airfields located deep inside Russian territory.But Starmer left Washington with no such announcement being made, putting Kyiv's hopes on hold once again.'I understand Ukraine's perspective on it,' Sullivan said, adding: 'But rather than me trying to elaborate on the reasoning one way or the other, this is something that I think is the subject of intense consultation among allies and partners, and will be (discussed) between President (Biden) and President Zelensky.'Zelensky is due to travel to New York later this month for the United Nations General Assembly.Speaking at the same conference a day earlier, Zelensky said the U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles are 'pointless' in Ukraine due to their limited quantity and restrictions on strikes deep inside Russia imposed by Western partners.The U.S. began providing Ukraine with Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), which have a range of up to 300 kilometers (190 miles), in the spring.While these missiles have been used in Russian-occupied Crimea, Washington's restrictions prevent their use on Russian soil.'ATACMS in the form that we have today (in Ukraine) is pointless if you cannot use it on their (Russian) military bases, airfields with helicopters and airplanes. It's pointless,' Zelensky said.'If ATACMS has a big restriction on the use of missiles because there are few of them... Unfortunately, it doesn't work.'The NYT reported that it's likely a decision will be made about Storm Shadows before one is reached over ATACMS.While Ukraine has been pleading for permission for months, it's understood the stance of Western nations has changed in light of Iran supplying Russia with ballistic missiles.'We've now seen this action of Russia acquiring ballistic missiles from Iran, which will further empower their aggression in Ukraine. So if anyone is taking escalatory action, it would appear to be Mr. Putin and Russia,' U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy, said while visiting Kyiv earlier this week.Lammy added that Iran supplying ballistic missiles to Russia 'clearly changes the debate' around the issue, as it allows the Kremlin to gain 'further penetration into Ukraine.'Zelensky is also expected to present Biden with a plan for Ukraine's victory against Russia, which will also be presented to Vice President Kamala Harris and ex-President Donald Trump, the two candidates for the upcoming November presidential election.'I do think we need a comprehensive strategy for success in this war and that is what President Zelensky says he's bringing,' Sullivan said.'And so we're very much looking forward to sitting down and talking that through, and President Biden is eager for that conversation.'And it's only right that it be President Zelensky who brings that because it is up to the democratically elected government of Ukraine and the people of Ukraine to set out the course of the war, their path to victory.'Russia launches counteroffensive in Kursk - can it push Ukraine off its own turf?More than a month after Ukraine launched an unprecedented incursion into Russian territory, Russian forces have begun counterattacking in Kursk Oblast, aiming to eventually drive Ukrainian troops out of the partially occupied border region.

Determined to reunite with his closest friends all the same, Lytvynov decided to ring in the New Year on the train, planning to meet with them on Jan. 1.Late at night, he traversed the empty, narrow corridor of the Lviv-Kyiv train to his dimly lit yet warm compartment. As the train gradually set off, the sound of its wheels on the tracks built into a steady rumble.Thus began a journey that would prove as exciting as the destination itself.Sitting alone on one of his compartment's dark-red leather beds, Lytvynov overheard people speaking loudly in the compartment next to his.'I went to them to ask if they wanted to celebrate the New Year together, and they agreed,' Lytvynov says.The moment he heard the names of his fellow travelers, Lytvynov was thunderstruck: The people sitting next to him were named Sandra, Mykhailo, and Volodymyr - just like the friends he was traveling to see.People on the escalator at the railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine, on June 12, 2024.

The four bonded instantly, exchanged contact information, and remain in touch to this day.Since Ukraine shut down its airports in February 2022, trains operated by the state-owned railway, Ukrzaliznytsia, have become one of the primary and perhaps the easiest means of travel both within Ukraine and abroad. Countless fascinating encounters and stories unfolded in the corridors and compartments of Ukrainian trains since then.Tetiana Kohut, a 37-year-old train attendant, often sees strangers find common ground while traveling. It's not surprising, she notes: in the intimate space of a train compartment during long journeys, shared everyday rituals - like sleeping or sipping tea - create a cozy atmosphere, naturally fostering connections among passengers.Trains have also evolved into unexpected hubs for celebrity encounters and important connections, often paving the way to shared projects and other new opportunities.War changes everythingSince the start of Russia's full-scale war, Ukrainian trains have borne witness to more tears of sorrow, sadness, and grief than ever before.Just a day after Russian troops began heavily bombarding Ukrainian cities in late February 2022, Kohut was working on her regular route from Lviv, her hometown, to Novooleksiivka in Kherson Oblast. But her train never reached the destination. The village, located on the east bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson Oblast, was swiftly occupied by the Russians.'We reached Zaporizhzhia and were told that we could not go further,' Kohut says. 'We also were ordered to allow everyone on the train, not only those with tickets. We became an evacuation train.'A train attendant of nearly 20 years, Kohut heard the sounds of explosions for the first time that day in Zaporizhzhia. She also saw hundreds of people at the station. Many of them were crying, and others looked lost and heartbroken, leaving suitcases on the platform as they boarded the lifesaving train to escape the war.The first-class sleeping car she worked in was designed to accommodate 20 people but ended up carrying nearly 200, Kohut says. 'A woman from Zaporizhzhia helped me count the passengers and wrote a heartwarming letter to thank us.'People walk to the railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine, on June 12, 2024. (Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)Train attendant Tetiana Kohut checks the tickets of passengers before departure to Lviv at a railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine on June 12, 2024. (Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)The start of the all-out war changed everything for Kohut and many other train attendants across Ukraine. In the first few months of the invasion, they worked without breaks, despite their exhaustion, to ensure everyone who wanted to escape the war could board their trains. The war also heightened the hazards of their work, as Russian attacks occasionally target train stations. Over 600 Ukrzaliznytsia employees have been killed since Feb. 24, 2022.Kohut says she lost colleagues in the Aug. 24, 2022 Russian attack on Chaplyne, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, when a passenger train and a residential area were hit, killing a total of 25 people. One of her close friends, a fellow train attendant, was seriously injured in the attack.Once filled with laughter and excitement for upcoming travels, the train cars are now often filled with crying, silence, or the heavy sighs of people sharing the pain brought by Russia's war. 'We have to be doctors... We have to be psychologists for our passengers now,' says Kohut.Despite the dangers, trains have been also the primary means of traveling to Ukraine for many of the world's top politicians and celebrities, with over 700 diplomatic missions arriving in Ukraine by train since the start of the invasion.U.S. President Joe Biden walks along the train platform after a surprise visit to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in Kyiv, Ukraine on Feb. 20, 2023.

(EU Commission/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Kohut has had the fortune to work on many such routes, and has met former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Polish President Andrzej Duda, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and others.'Right now, all the world-famous celebrities are traveling (to Ukraine) by train. I only ever saw them on TV before, and serving them now is just so pleasant, it's indescribable,' says Kohut.Unexpected tearsA chance encounter on a train initially brought tears to the eyes of Kyiv resident Olha Hrianyk, and led her to experience grief she thought she would never endure again.Hrianyk, 63, and her husband were traveling from Chernivtsi to the capital last May when a tall young man entered their compartment. The couple noticed a very familiar and cherished unit badge on his backpack.''Are you from the Azov brigade?' My husband asked,' Hrianyk recalls. 'He said: 'How do you know?'''I told him that our son was an Azov fighter.'Hrianyk's son Oleksandr helped liberate Kyiv Oblast in the early months of the full-scale war. He was then transferred to defend Mariupol, ending up at the Azovstal steel plant, the last Ukrainian stronghold in the city, where he was killed on May 8, 2022. He was 29.Evening railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine on June 12, 2024. (Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)Train attendant Tetiana Kohut before departure to Lviv at the railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine on June 12, 2024. (Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)Vladyslav, the young man they accidentally met on the train, was undergoing training to join Azov. Some of his commanders had known Hrianyk's son Oleksandr well: 'He told us it was a great honor for him to meet us,' Hrianyk says.The elderly couple and the young soldier talked until late at night, opening their hearts and sharing stories about military service and the war: 'I looked at him thinking, 'Son, you're so bright, you're so proud to be there (in Azov). What amazing young people we have,'' says Hrianyk.'In that brief time, that child became like family to me.'They shared phone numbers and kept in touch with Vladyslav while he was undergoing military training in Kyiv, often inviting him over for dinner or simply to rest after being on duty.One day last September, Vladyslav's mother suddenly called Hrianyk, expressing relief at finally contacting the couple her son had accidentally met on the train and had told her a lot about. But then she delivered some heartbreaking news: Vladyslav had been killed in combat near Bakhmut. He was only 19.'We printed his portrait and put it at the fallen soldiers' memorial (next to the St. Michael's Cathedral in Kyiv). (The portrait of) our Oleksandr is there too,' Hrianyk says.'Now, as we come there to see our Sasha, we come to see Vlad, too.'Turning words into actionsFor many Ukrainians, meetings on trains have sparked new ideas and fruitful collaborations for their projects or businesses.Vinnytsia-based Nataliia Kovalchuk, a content creator for an NGO called the National Network of Local Philanthropy Development, recalls numerous captivating experiences during her work trips across Ukraine.People talk on the phones inside the train on the railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine on June 12, 2024. (Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)'My team laughs at me when I say, 'You'll never believe it, but I met someone on the train again,'' Kovalchuk says.During her railway journeys, Kovalchuk always buys a cup of hot tea - a true gem of Ukrainian train travel, served by train attendants in a special glass with a metal cup holder. Little did she know that accidentally spilling her tea onto a nearby passenger's belongings would lead to another valuable connection.Surprisingly, the spilled tea did not lead to bad feelings, but helped Kovalchuk bond with the woman whose belongings she had soaked. It turned out that the woman worked at a center for the physical and psychological rehabilitation of Ukrainian soldiers.Kovalchuk donated some books for the soldiers undergoing rehabilitation there and helped the center boost its social media presence to attract more funding in the future.Now she is planning to invite some of the war veterans from the center to give a lecture to local young people and her organization on inclusivity and treatment of people with disabilities in Ukraine.And all this became possible thanks to a chance encounter on a train.As the evening comes down, people walk to the railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine, on June 12, 2024.

3 killed in Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia Oblast, governor says	A Russian attack killed three civilians in the Huliaipole community, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, regional governor Ivan Fedorov reported on Sept. 14.Fedorov said in a statement on social media that Russian forces struck the territory of an agricultural enterprise, without specifying the type of weapon used. All three victims were the enterprise's employees, he added.The front-line community of Huliaipole has about 20,000 residents. It has been subjected to constant attacks from Russian positions in the south over the course of the full-scale Russian invasion. The town lies less than 10 kilometers north of the front line and some 90 kilometers (56 miles) southeast of the regional center, Zaporizhzhia.Fedorov reported earlier that Huliaipole was attacked with artillery and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) of different modifications over the past day. https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-returns-103-pows-including-23-azov-fighters/	https://kyivindependent.com/governor-3-killed-in-russian-attack-on-zaporizhzhia-oblast/	2024-09-14T09:35:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2024-09-03_00-04-14.jpg

Some Ukrainian POWs died in captivity from causes such as 'blunt force trauma'.This is the 57th prisoner exchange since the outbreak of the full-scale war, and the second exchange carried out in the last two days.

NATO could have done more to stop Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Stoltenberg says	NATO could have provided Ukraine with more arms to prevent Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the bloc's Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg, said in an interview published Sept. 14.'Now we provide military stuff to a war — then we could have provided military stuff to prevent the war,' he told the German newspaper FAS.Stoltenberg said the day the war was launched was the worst in his 10-year stint in the role, from which he is stepping down next month. Former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, will take his place.'I wasn't surprised because we knew from the intelligence services what was going to happen,' he said.'But seeing it actually happen still shocked me. I realized that this was a turning point in our history: There is a Europe before that day and a different Europe after that day.'Stoltenberg highlighted NATO's reluctance to send weapons Ukraine was asking for before the launch of the full-scale invasion, over Western fears of escalation, something which continues to this day and has led to long delays in weapons systems such as tanks and fighter jets.He also said the war would only end with 'dialogue with Russia at a certain stage,' but added it 'has to be based on Ukrainian strength.'Stoltenberg has consistently urged NATO allies to increase defense spending amid risks of fracturing among the alliance. Multiple NATO countries, including Slovakia and Hungary have questioned NATO's commitment to supporting Ukraine in the war, calling instead for a peace agreement.During the recent NATO summit in Washington, the alliance clarified Ukraine's 'irreversible' path toward NATO by emphasizing the alliance's ongoing commitments to Kyiv 'constitute a bridge to Ukraine's membership.'NATO allies also announced plans to provide Ukraine with a minimum baseline funding of 40 billion euros ($43 billion), a new military command in Germany to train and equip Ukrainian troops, and further air defense commitments.Ukraine's long-range missile strike hopes on hold once again but encouraging signs remainUkraine's hopes of being allowed to use Western-supplied long range missiles to strike deep inside Russian territory were put on hold once again on Sept. 13, after the leaders of the U.S. and U.K. stopped short of making the announcement Kyiv wanted.

Ukraine's long-range missile strike hopes on hold once again but encouraging signs remain	Ukraine's hopes of being allowed to use Western-supplied long range missiles to strike deep inside Russian territory were put on hold once again on Sept. 13, after the leaders of the U.S. and U.K. stopped short of making the announcement Kyiv wanted.Anticipation had been high ahead of meetings between President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Washington, but the White House dampened expectations even before the pair had finished talks.'There is no change to our view on the provision of long-range strike capabilities for Ukraine to use inside of Russia,' National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters.Ukraine was hoping for permission to use two Western-supplied long range missiles that it already possesses to strike military targets such as airfields located deep inside Russian territory.With the bans in place, Kyiv says it cannot effectively defend Ukrainian cities from intensifying aerial attacks.The two missiles are the U.S.-supplied ATACMS, a short-range supersonic tactical ballistic missile, and the U.K.-France-supplied Storm Shadow.Both Storm Shadows and ATACMS were initially given to Kyiv on the provision that they only be used to strike Russian targets within Ukraine or in Russian-occupied parts of the country.Western fears of escalating the war with Russia have been behind the restrictions.The tide began to shift after Russia's renewed offensive in Kharkiv Oblast in May, when the U.S. and other Western allies eased restrictions, allowing Ukraine to strike targets with Western weapons— in a defensive fashion — inside Russia.In the lead up to Starmer and Biden meeting on Sept. 13, multiple media reports suggested both countries might be on the verge of allowing Kyiv to use their long-range weapons to strike targets deep in Russian territory.According to Politico, on Sept. 11, Biden was said to be finalizing the details of a plan to lift some restrictions.On the same day, the Guardian reported that the U.K. had already privately decided to allow Ukraine to use its British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles for long-range strikes, though no public announcement had been made at the time.Hopes were understandably high that an announcement would come after the meeting between Biden and Starmer.Speaking to reporters at the White House, Starmer said the meeting with Biden had been a 'wide-ranging discussion about strategy' rather than a decision-making process about 'a particular capability.''We've had a long and productive discussion on a number of problems, including Ukraine, as you'd expect, the Middle East, and the Indo-Pacific, talking strategically about tactical decisions,' he said.According to reports, the U.K. has already decided to grant Ukraine permission to use Storm Shadows to strike targets deep inside Russia.The White House said the meeting between the two leaders was called at the request of the U.K., and according to The New York Times (NYT), Britain wants explicit permission from Biden so a coordinated strategy can be presented.While Kirby was very clear that a decision was not coming on Sept, 13, he didn't rule out that one could be made in the near future.According to the Guardian, Starmer suggested the plan would be further discussed 'with a wider group of individuals' at the UN general assembly in New York later this month.The NYT reported that it's likely a decision will be made about Storm Shadows before one is reached over ATACMS.While Ukraine has been pleading for permission for months, it's understood the stance of Western nations has changed in light of Iran supplying Russia with ballistic missiles.'We've now seen this action of Russia acquiring ballistic missiles from Iran, which will further empower their aggression in Ukraine. So if anyone is taking escalatory action, it would appear to be Mr. Putin and Russia,' U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy, said while visiting Kyiv earlier this week.Lammy added that the Iran supplying ballistic missiles to Russia 'clearly changes the debate' around the issue, as it allows the Kremlin to gain 'further penetration into Ukraine.'Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials have upped their saber-rattling in response, claiming that the move would mean NATO is directly at war with Russia.'I do not think much about Vladimir Putin,' Biden said when asked on Sept. 13 what he thought about the Russian president's remarks.The long-range missiles Ukraine could soon be firing deep into RussiaThe U.S. and U.K. may be on the verge of what could be a hugely significant move regarding the war in Ukraine, with reports suggesting both countries might soon allow Kyiv to use their long-range weapons to strike targets deep in Russian territory.

Zelensky reveals details of July call with Trump, says he claimed to be 'very supportive'	President Volodymyr Zelensky has revealed Donald Trump told him during a call in July he is 'very supportive,' and would do 'everything to strengthen Ukraine' if elected president.In a preview clip of an interview with CNN to be aired on Sept. 15, Zelensky said Trump also told him 'he understands how difficult it is to survive during the war.'The comments are at odds with Trump's previous public statements on Ukraine.During the presidential debate on Sept. 10, the former president reiterated earlier statements that his primary concern was ending the war - which he has previously claimed he could do in 24 hours - but refrained from providing any concrete details.Media reports indicated that Trump privately suggested he would end Russia's war by pressuring Ukraine to cede occupied Crimea and Donbas to Moscow. He voiced strong criticism of American aid to Ukraine at a campaign rally in Detroit on June 15, describing Zelensky as 'maybe the greatest salesman of any politician that's ever lived' for securing substantial financial support from the U.S.The U.S. has provided historic levels of foreign aid to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, sending over $100 billion in military assistance and budget support critical to fighting off Russia and helping the government continue to operate.During the debate, Trump also refused to answer whether Ukraine being victorious was in the best interests of the U.S., instead insisting that it was in America's 'best interest to get this war finished and negotiate a deal.'Trump's vice-presidential running mate Sen. J.D. Vance said in an interview on Sept. 12 that Donald Trump's plan to end Russia's war could include the establishment of a special demilitarized zone between Ukraine and Russia, among other arrangements.When asked by CNN's Fareed Zakaria how Zelensky understands Trump's comments that he would end the war in 24 hours, Zelensky dismissed the comments as 'election messages,' that may not reflect what his actual policies will be if he is elected president.'I can't understand it for today because I don't know the details — what he means and what does it mean,' Zelensky said, referring to Trump's alleged plan.'My position is that the election period and election messages are election messages. Sometimes they are not very real,' Zelensky said during a clip of the interview, which is set to be fully published on Sept. 15.Zelensky did however acknowledge that Trump's statements have made some Ukrainians 'nervous.'Zelensky will visit the U.S. later this month to present President Joe Biden with a 'victory plan,' which he told CNN would also be presented to Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump, ahead of the upcoming November presidential election.Ukrainian officials, including Zelensky, have stressed that Kyiv will continue to cooperate productively with any U.S. administration, regardless of the outcome of the November election.Is 'Russians at War' propaganda?

Red Cross says it has suspended operations at Dnipro office following attack that killed, injured employees	A spokesperson for the Ukrainian delegation of the International Committee of the Red Cross says that the organization has suspended operations at its Dnipro office after three of its employees were killed in a strike on Sept. 12.Russian forces attacked the village of Viroliubivka near Kostiantynivka, hitting the territory of the enterprise, Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin said.The attack destroyed a truck with humanitarian aid and a car, killing three employees of the International Committee of the Red Cross mission and injuring two others.'For now, our Dnipro office has suspended operations for some time,' Spokesperson Oleksandr Vlasenko said following the attack. Vlasenko did not specify when the office is expected to reopen. Although the attack did not target the office, regular Russian attacks on the region have continued to pose a serious risk to Red Cross employees stationed along the front line.In a statement, the Red Cross said that its team was preparing to distribute firewood and fuel briquettes north of Donetsk to residents when the attack occurred.Had the employees been actively distributing the materials when the attack occurred, 'there could have been much more casualties,' Vlasenko said.The Red Cross has not pointed the blame on Russia for the attack, with Vlasenko adding that the organization 'does not know exactly' who has committed the attack. In response to the Red Cross' hesitation to directly blame Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said it was 'disappointing to see that the Red Cross, in its official communication afraid to even say it was a Russian strike.''This is our life, but it's their face. And this is not just the truth - it's a Russian strike - it is Russian terror,' Zelensky added.Russia has regularly attacked the regions lying on Ukraine's easter front with missile, guided bomb, and drones.
