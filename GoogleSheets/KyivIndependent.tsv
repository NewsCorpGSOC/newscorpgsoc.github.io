Ukraine launched production of 155-mm artillery shells, official says	Ukraine already produces its own 155 mm artillery ammunition, said Oleksandr Kamyshin, newly appointed by President Zelensky as external adviser for strategic issues. Kamishyn, who resigned from his post as Strategic Industries Minister during the biggest wartime government reshuffle on Sept. 4, told Norwegian media Nettavisen that Ukraine&apos;s production of defense material doubled under his leadership. &quot;By the end of the year, it will have tripled. We continue to drive on,&quot; Kamishyn added. Ukraine has long tried to ramp up domestic ammunition production to become more independent from Western partners. In the summer of 2023, Ukroboronprom said that it had already mastered the production of 82 mm mortar mines, 122 mm, and 152 mm artillery rounds, as well as 125 mm tank shells. Earlier media reports cited Ukrainian officials hoping to begin producing &quot;desperately needed&quot; NATO-standard 155 mm artillery rounds in the &apos;second half&apos; of 2024 at the earliest. &quot;This is a very complicated process. This is something that Ukraine has never done before,&quot; Kamyshin said, adding that he &quot;can&apos;t say much&quot; on the matter. Despite domestic efforts, the Ukrainian army still mainly depends on supplying 155 mm shells from partners, as European countries join forces to buy the rounds outside Europe. The U.S. also opened a new factory last May to produce 155 mm munitions for Ukraine and significantly increased production in some existing factories.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-launched-production-of-155-mm-artillery-shells-official-says/	2024-09-14T15:06:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/nammo-8.jpg
Germany won't allow long-range strikes on Russia even if other countries do, Scholz says	Germany will not allow Ukraine to launch attacks with German weapons far behind the front &quot;even if other countries decide otherwise,&quot; German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said. His statement comes shortly after U.S. President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stopped short of lifting restrictions on using Western-supplied long-range weapons on Russian territory during their meeting in Washington on Sept. 13, while media continue to report on encouraging signs that the ban might be reversed. Scholz said during the public talk in Prenzlau, Brandenburg that Germany &quot;will continue to support Ukraine militarily&quot; so that the country &quot;does not collapse,&quot; German media Welt reported. However, Scholz stressed that he would remain opposed to the idea of Ukraine using German long-range weapons to attack targets deep inside Russia. &quot;I am sticking to my position, even if other countries decide differently,&quot; Scholz said. Commenting on media reports that the U.S. could lift the existing restrictions, he said that not all speculations are correct, according to Welt. Restrictions on the usage of U.S.-made and provided ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile System) are &quot;the subject of intense consultation among allies and partners, and will be (discussed) between President (Biden) and President Zelensky,&quot; U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sept. 14. According to earlier media reports on Sept. 11, Biden was said to be finalizing the details of the plan to lift some restrictions, while the U.K. had reportedly privately decided to allow Ukraine to use its British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles for long-range strikes, though no public announcement had been made. Meanwhile, German media Spiegel reported on Sept. 13 that the debate is also ongoing inside the German parliament on whether Ukraine should be provided with German long-range missiles Taurus, with politicians from the FDP and the Greens supporting the decision. Ukraine has long been urging the West to lift the ban on striking military targets deep inside Russia. On Sept. 13, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his speech at the YES conference that without the ability to strike inside Russia, &#xA0;U.S.-provided ATACAMS &#xA0;(Army Tactical Missile Systems) are &#x201C;pointless.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-wont-allow-long-range-strikes-on-russia-even-if-other-countries-do-scholz-says/	2024-09-14T12:32:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1834521425.jpeg
ATACMS restrictions subject of 'intense consultations' between Ukraine and allies, Sullivan says	Allowing Ukraine to use ATACMS to strike targets deep inside Russia is the subject of &quot;intense consultations,&quot; U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, said on Sept. 14. Speaking at the Yalta European Strategy conference in Kyiv, Sullivan reiterated that no decision had yet been made, a day after President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer met in Washington to discuss the issue. Ukraine had been hoping for permission to be granted during the talks to use two Western-supplied long-range missiles &#x2013; Storm Shadow and ATACMS &#x2013; to strike military targets such as airfields located deep inside Russian territory. But Starmer left Washington with no such announcement being made, putting Kyiv&apos;s hopes on hold once again. &quot;I understand Ukraine&apos;s perspective on it,&quot; Sullivan said, adding: &quot;But rather than me trying to elaborate on the reasoning one way or the other, this is something that I think is the subject of intense consultation among allies and partners, and will be (discussed) between President (Biden) and President Zelensky.&quot; Zelensky is due to travel to New York later this month for the United Nations General Assembly. Speaking at the same conference a day earlier, Zelensky said the U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles are &quot;pointless&quot; in Ukraine due to their limited quantity and restrictions on strikes deep inside Russia imposed by Western partners. The U.S. began providing Ukraine with Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), which have a range of up to 300 kilometers (190 miles), in the spring. While these missiles have been used in Russian-occupied Crimea, Washington&apos;s restrictions prevent their use on Russian soil. &quot;ATACMS in the form that we have today (in Ukraine) is pointless if you cannot use it on their (Russian) military bases, airfields with helicopters and airplanes. It&apos;s pointless,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;If ATACMS has a big restriction on the use of missiles because there are few of them... Unfortunately, it doesn&apos;t work.&quot; The NYT reported that it&apos;s likely a decision will be made about Storm Shadows before one is reached over ATACMS. While Ukraine has been pleading for permission for months, it&apos;s understood the stance of Western nations has changed in light of Iran supplying Russia with ballistic missiles. &quot;We&apos;ve now seen this action of Russia acquiring ballistic missiles from Iran, which will further empower their aggression in Ukraine. So if anyone is taking escalatory action, it would appear to be Mr. Putin and Russia,&quot; U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy, said while visiting Kyiv earlier this week. Lammy added that Iran supplying ballistic missiles to Russia &quot;clearly changes the debate&quot; around the issue, as it allows the Kremlin to gain &quot;further penetration into Ukraine.&quot; Zelensky is also expected to present Biden with a plan for Ukraine&apos;s victory against Russia, which will also be presented to Vice President Kamala Harris and ex-President Donald Trump, the two candidates for the upcoming November presidential election. &quot;I do think we need a comprehensive strategy for success in this war and that is what President Zelensky says he&apos;s bringing,&quot; Sullivan said. &quot;And so we&apos;re very much looking forward to sitting down and talking that through, and President Biden is eager for that conversation. &quot;And it&apos;s only right that it be President Zelensky who brings that because it is up to the democratically elected government of Ukraine and the people of Ukraine to set out the course of the war, their path to victory.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/atacms-restrictions-subject-of-intense-consultations-between-ukraine-and-allies-sullivan-says/	2024-09-14T12:00:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168222225.jpg
From strangers to friends: How Ukrainians meet and bond during wartime train travel	For the past eight years, Anton Lytvynov, a stage director at Lviv National Opera, has celebrated New Year in Kyiv with his three friends &#x2013; Sandra, Mykhailo, and Volodymyr. However, on Dec. 31, 2022, work commitments kept Lytvynov in Lviv longer than he had expected. Determined to reunite with his closest friends all the same, Lytvynov decided to ring in the New Year on the train, planning to meet with them on Jan. 1. Late at night, he traversed the empty, narrow corridor of the Lviv-Kyiv train to his dimly lit yet warm compartment. As the train gradually set off, the sound of its wheels on the tracks built into a steady rumble. Thus began a journey that would prove as exciting as the destination itself. Sitting alone on one of his compartment&#x2019;s dark-red leather beds, Lytvynov overheard people speaking loudly in the compartment next to his. &quot;I went to them to ask if they wanted to celebrate the New Year together, and they agreed,&quot; Lytvynov says. The moment he heard the names of his fellow travelers, Lytvynov was thunderstruck: The people sitting next to him were named Sandra, Mykhailo, and Volodymyr &#x2013; just like the friends he was traveling to see.

The four bonded instantly, exchanged contact information, and remain in touch to this day. Since Ukraine shut down its airports in February 2022, trains operated by the state-owned railway, Ukrzaliznytsia, have become one of the primary and perhaps the easiest means of travel both within Ukraine and abroad. Countless fascinating encounters and stories unfolded in the corridors and compartments of Ukrainian trains since then. Tetiana Kohut, a 37-year-old train attendant, often sees strangers find common ground while traveling. It&#x2019;s not surprising, she notes: in the intimate space of a train compartment during long journeys, shared everyday rituals &#x2013; like sleeping or sipping tea &#x2013; create a cozy atmosphere, naturally fostering connections among passengers. Trains have also evolved into unexpected hubs for celebrity encounters and important connections, often paving the way to shared projects and other new opportunities. Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war, Ukrainian trains have borne witness to more tears of sorrow, sadness, and grief than ever before. Just a day after Russian troops began heavily bombarding Ukrainian cities in late February 2022, Kohut was working on her regular route from Lviv, her hometown, to Novooleksiivka in Kherson Oblast. But her train never reached the destination. The village, located on the east bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson Oblast, was swiftly occupied by the Russians. &quot;We reached Zaporizhzhia and were told that we could not go further,&quot; Kohut says. &quot;We also were ordered to allow everyone on the train, not only those with tickets. We became an evacuation train.&quot; A train attendant of nearly 20 years, Kohut heard the sounds of explosions for the first time that day in Zaporizhzhia. She also saw hundreds of people at the station. Many of them were crying, and others looked lost and heartbroken, leaving suitcases on the platform as they boarded the lifesaving train to escape the war. The first-class sleeping car she worked in was designed to accommodate 20 people but ended up carrying nearly 200, Kohut says. &quot;A woman from Zaporizhzhia helped me count the passengers and wrote a heartwarming letter to thank us.&quot; People walk to the railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine, on June 12, 2024. (Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)Train attendant Tetiana Kohut checks the tickets of passengers before departure to Lviv at a railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine on June 12, 2024. (Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)The start of the all-out war changed everything for Kohut and many other train attendants across Ukraine. In the first few months of the invasion, they worked without breaks, despite their exhaustion, to ensure everyone who wanted to escape the war could board their trains. The war also heightened the hazards of their work, as Russian attacks occasionally target train stations. Over 600 Ukrzaliznytsia employees have been killed since Feb. 24, 2022. Kohut says she lost colleagues in the Aug. 24, 2022 Russian attack on Chaplyne, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, when a passenger train and a residential area were hit, killing a total of 25 people. One of her close friends, a fellow train attendant, was seriously injured in the attack. Once filled with laughter and excitement for upcoming travels, the train cars are now often filled with crying, silence, or the heavy sighs of people sharing the pain brought by Russia&#x2019;s war. &quot;We have to be doctors&#x2026; We have to be psychologists for our passengers now,&quot; says Kohut. Despite the dangers, trains have been also the primary means of traveling to Ukraine for many of the world&apos;s top politicians and celebrities, with over 700 diplomatic missions arriving in Ukraine by train since the start of the invasion.

I only ever saw them on TV before, and serving them now is just so pleasant, it&#x2019;s indescribable,&quot; says Kohut. A chance encounter on a train initially brought tears to the eyes of Kyiv resident Olha Hrianyk, and led her to experience grief she thought she would never endure again. Hrianyk, 63, and her husband were traveling from Chernivtsi to the capital last May when a tall young man entered their compartment. The couple noticed a very familiar and cherished unit badge on his backpack. &quot;&apos;Are you from the Azov brigade?&apos; My husband asked,&quot; Hrianyk recalls. &quot;He said: &apos;How do you know?&apos;&quot; &quot;I told him that our son was an Azov fighter.&quot; Hrianyk&apos;s son Oleksandr helped liberate Kyiv Oblast in the early months of the full-scale war. He was then transferred to defend Mariupol, ending up at the Azovstal steel plant, the last Ukrainian stronghold in the city, where he was killed on May 8, 2022. He was 29.

(Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)Vladyslav, the young man they accidentally met on the train, was undergoing training to join Azov. Some of his commanders had known Hrianyk&#x2019;s son Oleksandr well: &quot;He told us it was a great honor for him to meet us,&quot; Hrianyk says. The elderly couple and the young soldier talked until late at night, opening their hearts and sharing stories about military service and the war: &quot;I looked at him thinking, &apos;Son, you&#x2019;re so bright, you&apos;re so proud to be there (in Azov). What amazing young people we have,&apos;&quot; says Hrianyk. &quot;In that brief time, that child became like family to me.&quot; They shared phone numbers and kept in touch with Vladyslav while he was undergoing military training in Kyiv, often inviting him over for dinner or simply to rest after being on duty. One day last September, Vladyslav&apos;s mother suddenly called Hrianyk, expressing relief at finally contacting the couple her son had accidentally met on the train and had told her a lot about. But then she delivered some heartbreaking news: Vladyslav had been killed in combat near Bakhmut. He was only 19. &quot;We printed his portrait and put it at the fallen soldiers&#x2019; memorial (next to the St. Michael&#x2019;s Cathedral in Kyiv). (The portrait of) our Oleksandr is there too,&quot; Hrianyk says. &#x201C;Now, as we come there to see our Sasha, we come to see Vlad, too.&#x201D; For many Ukrainians, meetings on trains have sparked new ideas and fruitful collaborations for their projects or businesses. Vinnytsia-based Nataliia Kovalchuk, a content creator for an NGO called the National Network of Local Philanthropy Development, recalls numerous captivating experiences during her work trips across Ukraine. People talk on the phones inside the train on the railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine on June 12, 2024. (Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)&quot;My team laughs at me when I say, &#x2018;You&#x2019;ll never believe it, but I met someone on the train again,&#x2019;&quot; Kovalchuk says. During her railway journeys, Kovalchuk always buys a cup of hot tea &#x2013; a true gem of Ukrainian train travel, served by train attendants in a special glass with a metal cup holder. Little did she know that accidentally spilling her tea onto a nearby passenger&apos;s belongings would lead to another valuable connection. Surprisingly, the spilled tea did not lead to bad feelings, but helped Kovalchuk bond with the woman whose belongings she had soaked. It turned out that the woman worked at a center for the physical and psychological rehabilitation of Ukrainian soldiers. Kovalchuk donated some books for the soldiers undergoing rehabilitation there and helped the center boost its social media presence to attract more funding in the future. Now she is planning to invite some of the war veterans from the center to give a lecture to local young people and her organization on inclusivity and treatment of people with disabilities in Ukraine. And all this became possible thanks to a chance encounter on a train. As the evening comes down, people walk to the railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine, on June 12, 2024.

3 killed in Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia Oblast, governor says	A Russian attack killed three civilians in the Huliaipole community, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, regional governor Ivan Fedorov reported on Sept. 14. Fedorov said in a statement on social media that Russian forces struck the territory of an agricultural enterprise, without specifying the type of weapon used. All three victims were the enterprise&apos;s employees, he added. The front-line community of Huliaipole has about 20,000 residents. It has been subjected to constant attacks from Russian positions in the south over the course of the full-scale Russian invasion. The town lies less than 10 kilometers north of the front line and some 90 kilometers (56 miles) southeast of the regional center, Zaporizhzhia. Fedorov reported earlier that Huliaipole was attacked with artillery and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) of different modifications over the past day. https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-returns-103-pows-including-23-azov-fighters/	https://kyivindependent.com/governor-3-killed-in-russian-attack-on-zaporizhzhia-oblast/	2024-09-14T09:35:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2024-09-03_00-04-14.jpg
103 Ukrainian POWs returned from Russian captivity, including 23 Azov fighters	President Volodymyr Zelensky has announced that 103 Ukrainian POWs were returned from Russian captivity on Sept. 14. &quot;Our people are home,&quot; he said in a post on social media. In a separate post, the Azov Angels charity fund said 23 of those released were Azov fighters, returning &quot;after more than two years of captivity.&quot; Azov fighters became a symbol of Ukraine&apos;s resistance through their tenacious defense of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol in the first three months of the all-out war. Russian forces eventually occupied Mariupol in May 2022, capturing the remaining defenders.

This is the 57th prisoner exchange since the outbreak of the full-scale war, and the second exchange carried out in the last two days. Earlier on Sept. 13, 49 Ukrainian soldiers and civilians were released from Russian captivity. They included personnel of the Armed Forces, the National Guard, the National Police, and border guards. A total of 3,672 Ukrainians have been brought back from Russian captivity. Kyiv aims to conduct an all-for-all prisoner exchange, which was one of the subjects at Ukraine&apos;s peace summit in Switzerland in mid-June.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-returns-103-pows-including-23-azov-fighters/	2024-09-14T05:14:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GXbuZI2XoAADWQB.jpeg

NATO could have done more to stop Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Stoltenberg says	NATO could have provided Ukraine with more arms to prevent Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the bloc&apos;s Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg, said in an interview published Sept. 14. &quot;Now we provide military stuff to a war &#x2014; then we could have provided military stuff to prevent the war,&quot; he told the German newspaper FAS. Stoltenberg said the day the war was launched was the worst in his 10-year stint in the role, from which he is stepping down next month. Former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, will take his place. &quot;I wasn&apos;t surprised because we knew from the intelligence services what was going to happen,&quot; he said. &quot;But seeing it actually happen still shocked me. I realized that this was a turning point in our history: There is a Europe before that day and a different Europe after that day.&quot; Stoltenberg highlighted NATO&apos;s reluctance to send weapons Ukraine was asking for before the launch of the full-scale invasion, over Western fears of escalation, something which continues to this day and has led to long delays in weapons systems such as tanks and fighter jets. He also said the war would only end with &quot;dialogue with Russia at a certain stage,&quot; but added it &quot;has to be based on Ukrainian strength.&quot; Stoltenberg has consistently urged NATO allies to increase defense spending amid risks of fracturing among the alliance. Multiple NATO countries, including Slovakia and Hungary have questioned NATO&apos;s commitment to supporting Ukraine in the war, calling instead for a peace agreement. During the recent NATO summit in Washington, the alliance clarified Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible&quot; path toward NATO by emphasizing the alliance&apos;s ongoing commitments to Kyiv &quot;constitute a bridge to Ukraine&apos;s membership.&quot; NATO allies also announced plans to provide Ukraine with a minimum baseline funding of 40 billion euros ($43 billion), a new military command in Germany to train and equip Ukrainian troops, and further air defense commitments.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-could-have-done-more-to-stop-russias-full-scale-invasion-of-ukraine-stoltenberg-says/	2024-09-14T03:36:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161534905.jpg
Ukraine's long-range missile strike hopes on hold once again but encouraging signs remain	Ukraine&apos;s hopes of being allowed to use Western-supplied long range missiles to strike deep inside Russian territory were put on hold once again on Sept. 13, after the leaders of the U.S. and U.K. stopped short of making the announcement Kyiv wanted. Anticipation had been high ahead of meetings between President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Washington, but the White House dampened expectations even before the pair had finished talks. &quot;There is no change to our view on the provision of long-range strike capabilities for Ukraine to use inside of Russia,&quot; National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters. Ukraine was hoping for permission to use two Western-supplied long range missiles that it already possesses to strike military targets such as airfields located deep inside Russian territory. With the bans in place, Kyiv says it cannot effectively defend Ukrainian cities from intensifying aerial attacks. The two missiles are the U.S.-supplied ATACMS, a short-range supersonic tactical ballistic missile, and the U.K.-France-supplied Storm Shadow. Both Storm Shadows and ATACMS were initially given to Kyiv on the provision that they only be used to strike Russian targets within Ukraine or in Russian-occupied parts of the country. Western fears of escalating the war with Russia have been behind the restrictions. The tide began to shift after Russia&#x2019;s renewed offensive in Kharkiv Oblast in May, when the U.S. and other Western allies eased restrictions, allowing Ukraine to strike targets with Western weapons&#x2014; in a defensive fashion &#x2014; inside Russia. In the lead up to Starmer and Biden meeting on Sept. 13, multiple media reports suggested both countries might be on the verge of allowing Kyiv to use their long-range weapons to strike targets deep in Russian territory. According to Politico, on Sept. 11, Biden was said to be finalizing the details of a plan to lift some restrictions. On the same day, the Guardian reported that the U.K. had already privately decided to allow Ukraine to use its British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles for long-range strikes, though no public announcement had been made at the time. Hopes were understandably high that an announcement would come after the meeting between Biden and Starmer. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Starmer said the meeting with Biden had been a &quot;wide-ranging discussion about strategy&quot; rather than a decision-making process about &quot;a particular capability.&quot; &quot;We&#x2019;ve had a long and productive discussion on a number of problems, including Ukraine, as you&#x2019;d expect, the Middle East, and the Indo-Pacific, talking strategically about tactical decisions,&quot; he said. According to reports, the U.K. has already decided to grant Ukraine permission to use Storm Shadows to strike targets deep inside Russia. The White House said the meeting between the two leaders was called at the request of the U.K., and according to The New York Times (NYT), Britain wants explicit permission from Biden so a coordinated strategy can be presented. While Kirby was very clear that a decision was not coming on Sept, 13, he didn&apos;t rule out that one could be made in the near future. According to the Guardian, Starmer suggested the plan would be further discussed &quot;with a wider group of individuals&quot; at the UN general assembly in New York later this month. The NYT reported that it&apos;s likely a decision will be made about Storm Shadows before one is reached over ATACMS. While Ukraine has been pleading for permission for months, it&apos;s understood the stance of Western nations has changed in light of Iran supplying Russia with ballistic missiles. &quot;We&apos;ve now seen this action of Russia acquiring ballistic missiles from Iran, which will further empower their aggression in Ukraine. So if anyone is taking escalatory action, it would appear to be Mr. Putin and Russia,&quot; U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy, said while visiting Kyiv earlier this week. Lammy added that the Iran supplying ballistic missiles to Russia &quot;clearly changes the debate&quot; around the issue, as it allows the Kremlin to gain &quot;further penetration into Ukraine.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials have upped their saber-rattling in response, claiming that the move would mean NATO is directly at war with Russia. &quot;I do not think much about Vladimir Putin,&quot; Biden said when asked on Sept. 13 what he thought about the Russian president&apos;s remarks.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-long-range-missile-strike-hopes-on-hold-once-again-but-encouraging-signs-remain/	2024-09-14T02:39:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170988521.jpg
Zelensky reveals details of July call with Trump, says he claimed to be 'very supportive'	President Volodymyr Zelensky has revealed Donald Trump told him during a call in July he is &quot;very supportive,&quot; and would do &quot;everything to strengthen Ukraine&quot; if elected president. In a preview clip of an interview with CNN to be aired on Sept. 15, Zelensky said Trump also told him &quot;he understands how difficult it is to survive during the war.&quot; The comments are at odds with Trump&apos;s previous public statements on Ukraine. During the presidential debate on Sept. 10, the former president reiterated earlier statements that his primary concern was ending the war &#x2013; which he has previously claimed he could do in 24 hours &#x2013; but refrained from providing any concrete details. Media reports indicated that Trump privately suggested he would end Russia&#x2019;s war by pressuring Ukraine to cede occupied Crimea and Donbas to Moscow. He voiced strong criticism of American aid to Ukraine at a campaign rally in Detroit on June 15, describing Zelensky as &quot;maybe the greatest salesman of any politician that&apos;s ever lived&quot; for securing substantial financial support from the U.S. The U.S. has provided historic levels of foreign aid to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, sending over $100 billion in military assistance and budget support critical to fighting off Russia and helping the government continue to operate. During the debate, Trump also refused to answer whether Ukraine being victorious was in the best interests of the U.S., instead insisting that it was in America&#x2019;s &#x201C;best interest to get this war finished and negotiate a deal.&quot; Trump&apos;s vice-presidential running mate Sen. J.D. Vance said in an interview on Sept. 12 that Donald Trump&apos;s plan to end Russia&apos;s war could include the establishment of a special demilitarized zone between Ukraine and Russia, among other arrangements. When asked by CNN&apos;s Fareed Zakaria how Zelensky understands Trump&apos;s comments that he would end the war in 24 hours, Zelensky dismissed the comments as &quot;election messages,&quot; that may not reflect what his actual policies will be if he is elected president. &quot;I can&apos;t understand it for today because I don&apos;t know the details &#x2014; what he means and what does it mean,&quot; Zelensky said, referring to Trump&apos;s alleged plan. &quot;My position is that the election period and election messages are election messages. Sometimes they are not very real,&quot; Zelensky said during a clip of the interview, which is set to be fully published on Sept. 15. Zelensky did however acknowledge that Trump&apos;s statements have made some Ukrainians &quot;nervous.&quot; Zelensky will visit the U.S. later this month to present President Joe Biden with a &#x201C;victory plan,&#x201D; which he told CNN would also be presented to Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump, ahead of the upcoming November presidential election. Ukrainian officials, including Zelensky, have stressed that Kyiv will continue to cooperate productively with any U.S. administration, regardless of the outcome of the November election.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-dismisses-trumps-contentious-statements-on-ukraine-as-election-messages/	2024-09-13T21:42:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168791629-1.jpg

Red Cross says it has suspended operations at Dnipro office following attack that killed, injured employees	A spokesperson for the Ukrainian delegation of the International Committee of the Red Cross says that the organization has suspended operations at its Dnipro office after three of its employees were killed in a strike on Sept. 12. Russian forces attacked the village of Viroliubivka near Kostiantynivka, hitting the territory of the enterprise, Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin said. The attack destroyed a truck with humanitarian aid and a car, killing three employees of the International Committee of the Red Cross mission and injuring two others. &quot;For now, our Dnipro office has suspended operations for some time,&quot; Spokesperson Oleksandr Vlasenko said following the attack. Vlasenko did not specify when the office is expected to reopen. Although the attack did not target the office, regular Russian attacks on the region have continued to pose a serious risk to Red Cross employees stationed along the front line. In a statement, the Red Cross said that its team was preparing to distribute firewood and fuel briquettes north of Donetsk to residents when the attack occurred. Had the employees been actively distributing the materials when the attack occurred, &quot;there could have been much more casualties,&quot; Vlasenko said. The Red Cross has not pointed the blame on Russia for the attack, with Vlasenko adding that the organization &quot;does not know exactly&quot; who has committed the attack. In response to the Red Cross&apos; hesitation to directly blame Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said it was &quot;disappointing to see that the Red Cross, in its official communication afraid to even say it was a Russian strike.&quot; &quot;This is our life, but it&#x2019;s their face. And this is not just the truth &#x2013; it&#x2019;s a Russian strike - it is Russian terror,&quot; Zelensky added. Russia has regularly attacked the regions lying on Ukraine&apos;s easter front with missile, guided bomb, and drones. Earlier on the day on Sept. 12, Russian forces attacked the Kostiantynivka community in Donetsk Oblast and the village of Borova in Kharkiv Oblast, killing five people and injuring at least nine, local authorities reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/red-cross-says-it-has-suspended-operations-at-dnipro-office-following-attack-that-killed-injured-employees/	2024-09-13T20:29:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/Red-Cross.jpg
Ukraine's chief rabbi mourns loss of adopted son, killed in combat	On September 12, a memorial service was held in Kyiv for Anton Samborskyi, the adopted son of Ukraine&apos;s Chief Rabbi Moshe Azman, who was killed in combat. Samborskyi, 32, had been missing since late July, with his death confirmed weeks later. Rabbi Azman, who adopted Samborskyi when he was 10, expressed his sorrow, recalling their last conversation and noting that Samborskyi had recently become a father before being drafted into the army. The service at the Central Synagogue of Kyiv was attended by servicemen, veterans, and others, and Samborskyi was buried in the city&#x2019;s Jewish cemetery afterward. Rabbi Azman expressed his gratitude for the overwhelming support he received after the passing of his son on X. &#x201C;Friends, I am grateful to each of you,&#x201D; he wrote on X. &#x201C;Your warm words, coming from the heart, fill me with confidence in our victory over evil.&#x201D; He also announced a fundraising campaign in memory of his son, to support those affected by the war, including refugees, the elderly, widows, and orphans.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-chief-rabbi-mourns-loss-of-adopted-son-killed-in-combat/	2024-09-13T18:26:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/ezgif-6-bc65b4d74c.jpg
US warns RT is directly involved in Russian intelligence operations	The U.S. State Department issued a press release on Sept. 13 saying that the Russian state-run media outlet RT is not just involved in spreading propaganda and misinformation, but is actively working with Russian intelligence to target countries across the world. &quot;We now know that RT moved beyond being simply a media outlet and has been an entity with cyber capabilities,&quot; the statement read. &quot;(RT) is also engaged in information operations, covert influence, and military procurement. These operations are targeting countries around the world, including in Europe, Africa, and North and South America.&quot; The warning follows similar statements in recent weeks that Russia is planning information campaigns to sow division in U.S. society and undermine support for Ukraine in swing states during the upcoming presidential race. A U.S. official told Reuters that RT is attempting to push U.S. viewers toward voting for Donald Trump in the presidential election through a network of Western media personalities. Earlier in September, the U.S. announced a sweeping crackdown on supposed Russian election interference, seizing 32 internet domains linked to Kremlin propaganda campaigns and sanctioning several high-profile propagandists working for RT. Alongside the new warning about RT, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that &quot;the State Department also designated the Russian state-funded and directed media company Rossiya Segodnya and five of its subsidiaries, including RT, under the Foreign Missions Act.&quot; &quot;As a result, these actors are now required to notify the State Department of all personnel working in the U.S. as well as their property.&quot; Blinken reiterated the State Department&apos;s warning, saying that &quot;Rossiya Segodnya and these five subsidiaries are no longer merely firehoses of Russian government propaganda and disinformation; they are engaged in covert influence activities aimed at undermining American elections and democracies, functioning like a de facto arm of Russia&apos;s intelligence apparatus.&quot; RT and the other subsidiaries are also actively assisting in a crowdfunding program to &quot;provide support and military equipment &#x2014; supplies, weaponry &#x2014; to Russian military units in Ukraine,&quot; Blinken said. While the U.S. is conscious not to impinge on free speech, &quot;even when it comes to media outlets that wittingly spread government propaganda,&quot; Blinken said that &quot;we will not stand by as RT and other actors carry out covert activities in support of Russia&apos;s nefarious activities.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-warns-rt-is-directly-involved-in-russian-intelligence-operations/	2024-09-13T14:16:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1246441673.jpg
