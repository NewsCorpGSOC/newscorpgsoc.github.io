Next Ramstein summit to be held on Feb. 12 under UK chairmanship, media reports	The next Ramstein-format summit of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) will take place on Feb. 12 under the chairmanship of the U.K. instead of the U.S., Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported on Feb. 5, citing its undisclosed sources. Following Donald Trump&apos;s administration&apos;s takeover of the White House, the future format of Ramstein&apos;s meetings remained uncertain. Trump has also signaled his intention to break with the current U.S. strategy concerning Ukraine. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said in January the next summit would be held in Brussels before the Munich Security Conference scheduled for Feb. 14-16. Pistorius did not disclose the meeting format, adding that it depended on the future U.S. administration. Some of Ramstein&apos;s functions, with the exception of organizing the Ramstein format meetings, have already been transferred to NATO. The NSATU (NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine) mission has been launched in Wiesbaden, Germany, to coordinate the fulfillment of the countries&apos; pledges to supply weapons. The UDCG consists of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The last Ramstein meeting on Jan. 9 was the group&apos;s 25th gathering since its establishment in April 2022. During the last meeting in the Ramstein format, one of the major topics of discussion was the protection of Ukraine&apos;s airspace, including providing new air defense systems.	https://kyivindependent.com/next-ramstein-summit-to-be-held-on-feb-12-under-uk-chairmanship-instead-of-us-media-reports/	2025-02-05T08:22:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193577260.jpg
Ukraine extends martial law until May 9	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed into law the extension of martial law and general mobilization from Feb. 8 to May 9. Zelensky first declared martial law and general mobilization on Feb. 24, 2022, when Russia started its full-scale invasionof Ukraine. The measure has been repeatedly extended since then. The president submitted a proposal to the parliament on Jan. 14 to extend martial law and general mobilization for another 90 days. Ukraine&apos;s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, voted to approve the extension one day later. The extension of general mobilization and martial law until May 9 coincides with the celebration of Victory Day in Russia. The Kremlin heavily leverages the annual Victory Day celebrations to project military strength and propagate its narrative of Soviet heroism in World War II. Under martial law, Ukrainian men aged between 18 and 60, with some exceptions, are not allowed to leave the country as they may be called up for military service. Due to martial law, Ukraine is also unable to hold parliamentary and presidential elections in accordance with the existing legislation. Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to use the delay to portray Zelensky as &quot;illegitimate,&quot; saying that the authority should pass to Parliament speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk, a claim rejected by Kyiv as a distortion of the constitution.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-extends-martial-law-mobilization-until-may-9/	2025-02-05T07:05:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192471458.jpg
Russian intelligence behind deadly Rivne draft office bombing, Ukraine's SBU claims	Russia recruited the attacker responsible for a deadly explosion at a military enlistment office in Rivne, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on Feb. 5, revealing details of the investigation. The bombing on Feb. 1 killed the suspected perpetrator and injured eight service members. Russian operatives recruited the man and then remotely detonated explosives, removing him as an &quot;&apos;unnecessary&apos; witness,&quot; the SBU said. According to the investigation, the attacker was a 21-year-old unemployed man from Zhytomyr Oblast who sought quick money on Telegram channels. Russian intelligence services allegedly recruited him online and offered him payment for carrying out an attack. The revelation follows a series of attacks on military enlistment officers, including explosions at draft offices in Rivne and Pavlohrad that injured several service members. A separate attack on Jan. 31 saw a draft officer shot dead in Poltava Oblast, with the perpetrator detained soon after. Another explosion near a military enlistment office in Kamianets-Podilskyi, Khmelnytskyi Oblast, on Feb. 5 left at least one person dead and four injured. The circumstances of the explosion are being investigated. Following Russia&apos;s instructions, the perpetrator of the Rivne attack arrived in the city with an improvised explosive device (IED) concealed in a tourist backpack. The device was linked to a mobile phone remotely controlled by Russian operatives, the SBU said. Upon entering the military enlistment office, the suspect held another phone with a &quot;remote control&quot; function. Russian handlers monitored the operation through the phone&apos;s camera and detonated the IED remotely as soon as the agent stepped inside. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, condemned the recent attacks and called for a full investigation and prosecution of those responsible. Kyiv has struggled to mobilize troops amid battlefield losses and the need to rotate soldiers who have been on the front lines since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-uncovers-russian-backed-recruitment-behind-deadly-rivne-draft-office-attack/	2025-02-05T06:16:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/SBU.jpg
Ukraine brings back 150 POWs from Russian captivity in prisoner swap	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Ukraine brought back 150 Ukrainian service members from Russian captivity, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Feb. 5, marking another prisoner exchange between Kyiv and Moscow. The released Ukrainian captives included members of the Navy, the Air Force, the Airborne Troops, the National Guard, the State Border Guard, the Territorial Defense Forces, and a police officer, according to the president. &quot;They are all from different sectors of the front, but they have one thing in common: they fought for Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said on Telegram. Concurrently, Russia announced the return of 150 Russian prisoners of war (POWs) from Ukrainian captivity.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-brings-back-150-ukrainians-from-russian-captivity-in-prisoner-swap/	2025-02-05T05:58:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-05_15-54-25.jpg
US 'not going to eliminate foreign aid,' Rubio says amid USAID shutdown push	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Feb. 4 that foreign aid should serve U.S. interests rather than function as charity, emphasizing that the Trump administration does not intend to halt all international assistance. &quot;I continue to support foreign aid. But foreign aid is not charity. It exists for the purpose of advancing the national interest of the United States,&quot; Rubio said at a press conference in Costa Rica. He added that the U.S. would not eliminate foreign aid but would ensure it benefits &quot;trusted partners and allies.&quot; The statement comes after the Trump administration halted almost all foreign assistance for 90 days pending review and growing uncertainties about the fate of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the country&apos;s chief foreign assistance arm. According to a directive issued on Feb. 4, USAID employees worldwide will be placed on administrative leave starting Feb. 7. For personnel stationed abroad, the agency, in coordination with the State Department, is drafting a plan to arrange and fund their return travel to the U.S., with exceptions for those performing &quot;mission-critical functions.&quot; Elon Musk, who heads the Department of Government Effectiveness (DOGE), has blasted USAID as a &quot;criminal organization&quot; and pushed for its dissolution. Rubio said the temporary aid freeze aims to review and restructure foreign assistance, claiming that the Trump administration struggled to obtain details about specific programs as USAID &quot;refused to tell us anything.&quot; Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and over $30 billion in direct budget support to Kyiv. On Feb. 3, the White House declared that &quot;under President Trump, the waste, fraud, and abuse ends now,&quot; accusing USAID of misusing taxpayer funds on unnecessary projects. The &quot;waste and abuse programs&quot; list included nothing related to Ukraine. Ukraine&apos;s parliamentary humanitarian and information policy committee has begun consultations with European partners to temporarily replace lost U.S. funding.	https://kyivindependent.com/rubio-us-aid/	2025-02-05T05:22:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194552772.jpg
Trump's team split over how to pressure Putin to end war in Ukraine, NBC reports	The administration of President Donald Trump is split over how to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin and bring him to the negotiating table to end the war in Ukraine, NBC News reported on Feb. 5. Citing U.S. and Ukrainian officials, the outlet said Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine, General Keith Kellogg, and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, are pushing for the White House to use its leverage over Russia to force Putin to back down. Without naming individuals, NBC News said others in the administration are in favor of withdrawing military support from Kyiv in order to hasten the end of the war, effectively forcing Ukraine to capitulate. The U.S. does have significant leverage over Russia in economic, military, and diplomatic terms, but questions remain over his willingness to use it. Russia&#x2019;s economy is showing signs of weakness, making Putin more vulnerable than ever to additional economic pressure like sanctions. Ramped-up support for Ukraine on the battlefield could add to Russia&#x2019;s mounting losses and further incentivize dealmaking, as would uniting support among allies and squeezing Russia on the diplomatic stage. President Volodymyr &#x200B;&#x200B;Zelensky has repeatedly ruled out any deal that would involve ceding territory to Russia, which currently occupies around 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory. Some of this land was taken during Russia&#x2019;s 2014 invasion, while the rest was captured following its full-scale assault in 2022. As Ukraine faces mounting battlefield losses, pressure is growing on Zelensky to consider compromises. Kellogg was officially appointed into his new role on Feb. 3. &quot;We made a lot of progress on Russia-Ukraine,&quot; Trump reportedly said after signing the decree without providing further details. Kellogg has praised Trump&apos;s willingness to engage with Putin, calling former U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s refusal to work with Putin a &quot;biggest mistake.&quot; Trump&apos;s envoy said he believes the new U.S. president can broker a satisfactory deal for both Putin and Zelensky. Kellogg told Reuters on Feb. 1 that Ukraine&apos;s presidential and parliamentary elections, suspended since the full-scale war began, &quot;need to be done.&quot; He argued that holding elections during wartime would strengthen Ukraine&apos;s democracy. The Trump administration is debating whether to secure a temporary ceasefire before negotiating a permanent resolution, with the election winner potentially overseeing future talks with Moscow. Kellogg also suggested using frozen Russian assets to purchase American weapons for Ukraine, as reported by Fox News on Jan. 24. Zelensky recently emphasized the need to end the war diplomatically in 2025, suggesting that a Trump administration could accelerate the process.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-team-split-over-how-to-pressure-putin-to-end-war-in-ukraine-nbc-reports/	2025-02-05T05:21:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197144376--1-.jpg
Ukraine offering gas storage facilities for US LNG to boost Europe's energy security	Ukraine could store U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) in its underground facilities to bolster bilateral cooperation and Europe&apos;s energy security, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Feb. 5 at a press conference attended by the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Ukraine has powerful underground gas storage facilities, and we have the potential for close, mutually beneficial cooperation in this area,&quot; the minister said during the press conference with his U.K. counterpart, David Lammy. Sybiha&apos;s remarks come as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks Ukrainian rare earths as a condition for continued aid to Ukraine. Sybiha suggested that energy cooperation could be another key component of the bilateral relationship. &quot;The range of common interests and mutually beneficial cooperation is not limited to these resources. For example, we see enormous potential &#x2014; especially after ending Russian gas transit through Ukraine&apos;s territory &#x2014; in the possibility of purchasing LNG gas from the U.S.,&quot; Sybiha said. The minister emphasized that the development of energy infrastructure presents opportunities for American businesses to invest in Ukraine&apos;s gas transportation system, but it also gives Kyiv a chance to become a guarantor of energy security in Europe. &quot;This is not only an economically beneficial partnership but also a strategic decision that will strengthen transatlantic relations and make Ukraine a key energy security hub for the entire region,&quot; he said. Ukraine did not extend an agreement with Russia on natural gas transit through its territory that expired on Jan. 1, citing its refusal to finance Russia&apos;s war. Zelensky has reaffirmed Ukraine&apos;s openness to mining rare earths with international partners during a press briefing on Feb. 4. His victory plan, first presented in 2024, includes a provision for foreign investment in Ukraine&apos;s mining industry. Trump has not specified which rare earths the U.S. seeks, but he has suggested that Kyiv is ready to cooperate. Ukraine possesses significant reserves of critical minerals, including titanium, which is used in aerospace and defense, and lithium, which is essential for electric vehicle batteries.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-offering-lng-storage-to-us/	2025-02-05T05:10:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197755028.jpg
Kellogg to discuss Trump's Ukraine strategy at Munich Security Conference	Keith Kellogg, U.S. Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, said on Feb. 5 he plans to attend the Munich Security Conference next week to discuss ending the war. &quot;I look forward to speaking about (Trump&apos;s) goal to end the bloody and costly war in Ukraine,&quot; Kellogg said on X. &quot;I&#x2019;ll meet with America&#x2019;s allies who are ready to work with us.&quot; Backing up his pledge to broker a swift peace deal, Trump recently said that Washington is leading &quot;very constructive&quot; talks on Ukraine and that his administration is in touch with both Kyiv and Moscow. Neither the president nor his Ukraine envoy provided details on how they plan to broker an end to the war. Kellogg, a retired general tasked with advancing Trump&apos;s strategy in the Russia-Ukraine war, is expected to visit Ukraine later this month for talks with Ukrainian officials. Trump has also revealed he intends to meet in person with Russian President Vladimir Putin, ending the diplomatic isolation imposed on the Kremlin&apos;s chief by former U.S. President Joe Biden. Trump&apos;s past criticism of Biden&apos;s support for Ukraine and his open sympathies for the Russian leader has sparked concerns he might reduce assistance or cut a deal unfavorable to Kyiv. Since taking office, the U.S. president has adopted a more confrontational stance toward Moscow, threatening tariffs and sanctions unless Putin agrees to negotiate. Trump has been largely evasive on whether he intends to continue providing military support to Ukraine, though he recently suggested Kyiv could secure continued assistance in exchange for the country&apos;s rare earths. Reuters reported on Feb. 3 that the U.S. briefly halted security aid before restarting it again for unclear reasons. Talking to Fox News on Feb. 1, Kellogg claimed that Trump has a &quot;reliable plan&quot; to end the war that entails &quot;pressuring not only Moscow but also Kyiv&quot; while offering positive initiatives for both. Kellogg will not be the only top official of the Trump administration attending the Munich conference, scheduled for Feb. 14-16. Organizers recently confirmed that Vice President JD Vance will also be in attendance.	https://kyivindependent.com/kellogg-to-discuss-trumps-ukraine-peace-plans-at-munich-security-conference/	2025-02-05T04:52:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1242112038.jpg
Explosion reported near Khmelnytskyi Oblast draft office — 1 killed, 4 injured	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. An explosion near a military enlistment office in the city of Kamianets-Podilskyi in Khmelnytskyi Oblast on Feb. 5 left at least one person dead and four injured, Suspilne reported, citing a police spokesperson. Investigators are reportedly working on the scene. Further details on the cause of the explosion and its full consequences have not been provided at the time of publication. The incident comes following several attacks against enlistment officers over the past few days, including explosions at the draft offices in Rivne and Pavlohrad that injured several service members. Another draft officer was shot dead in Poltava Oblast overnight on Jan. 31, with the perpetrator detained soon after. Earlier this week, Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi condemned the recent attacks, calling for a full investigation and punishment of the perpetrators. &quot;We expect a full and comprehensive investigation of these crimes. The perpetrators must be brought to justice,&quot; Syrskyi said. Ukraine has faced significant challenges in mobilizing troops to compensate for losses and rotate soldiers who have been on the front lines since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/explosion-reported-near-khmelnytskyi-oblast-draft-office/	2025-02-05T04:07:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1620354990.jpg
UK pledges $69 million to boost Ukraine's resilience, grain deliveries to Syria	The U.K. will provide Ukraine with 55 million pounds ($69 million) in new humanitarian and economic assistance to promote a long-term partnership between the two nations, the British government announced on Feb. 5. &quot;This funding for social, humanitarian, and energy programs will strengthen our resilience. And this assistance is very timely right now,&quot; Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said at a press conference with his British counterpart, David Lammy, attended by the Kyiv Independent. Lammy is visiting Kyiv to discuss continued U.K. support for Ukraine as it is about to enter the fourth year of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The U.K. official is expected to assess firsthand how British aid is assisting Ukraine on the battlefield and in civilian infrastructure recovery. The new funding is part of a broader 100-year partnership agreement signed by President Volodymyr Zelensky and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Jan. 16. In addition to the financial aid, the U.K. will allocate 3 million pounds ($3.7 million) to supply Ukrainian grain and other food products to Syria, working with the World Food Program. &quot;Unlike Russian grain supplies to the brutal Assad regime, which attempted to buy favor while burdening Syria with costly debt, this planned support will provide a lifeline to the most vulnerable in Syria,&quot; the British government&apos;s statement read. London previously committed a record 3 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) in military aid to Ukraine for 2024, including advanced weapons systems and munitions. The first 1.5 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) of a 2.26 billion pound ($2.7 billion) loan under the G7 program will also be released to fund major procurement projects for Ukraine&apos;s defense. The loan will be repaid using profits from immobilized Russian assets, marking another step in the West&apos;s efforts to use Russia&apos;s frozen funds to finance Ukraine&apos;s war effort and recovery. &quot;We have agreed on the need to continue using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine. In the near future, we will begin utilizing funds from the U.K. loan of more than 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) sourced from these assets,&quot; Sybiha said.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-announces-69-million-to-boost-ukraines-resilience-grain-deliveries-to-syria/	2025-02-05T03:38:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197174889.jpg
Russia ready to negotiate despite Zelensky's 'legitimacy problems,' Kremlin spox claims	Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov reiterated Russia&apos;s claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is illegitimate on Feb. 5 but said Moscow remains open to negotiations. Peskov&apos;s comments follow Zelensky&apos;s statement in an interview with U.K. journalist Piers Morgan that he was willing to sit at the negotiating table with Russian President Vladimir Putin if it was the only way to end the war. &quot;Mr. Zelensky has big problems de jure in terms of his legitimacy, but even so, the Russian side remains open to negotiations,&quot; Peskov claimed. The spokesperson also called Zelensky&apos;s recent comments on negotiations &quot;empty words,&quot; adding that they must be based on an actual &quot;readiness and desire.&quot; Russia has widely used the claim of Zelensky&apos;s alleged illegitimacy as part of its propaganda campaign to discredit Ukraine&apos;s government, arguing that Zelensky has served past his five-year term without holding new elections. Ukrainian legal experts and officials have dismissed the narrative as false and unfounded, pointing to the fact that Ukraine&apos;s constitution does not permit elections under martial law and that a significant portion of the Ukrainian population is under occupation and, therefore, cannot vote. Putin previously claimed that Zelensky had no right to sign any peace agreements, referencing the Ukrainian president&apos;s decree on Sept. 30, 2022, which banned negotiations with the Russian leader in response to Moscow&apos;s annexation of four Ukrainian regions. Zelensky clarified on Jan. 26 that the decree only applied to other Ukrainian officials, not himself. The discussion of potential negotiations comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed for a peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow, pledging to broker a swift settlement in the next few months. Zelensky, while saying that Ukraine was ready to end the &quot;hot stage&quot; of the war, suggested that if NATO membership is not an option, the U.S. should provide Ukraine with alternative security guarantees, including nuclear weapons, to prevent renewed Russian aggression. &quot;In general, such statements, such utterances, border on insanity,&quot; Peskov said in response to Zelensky&apos;s remarks. Russia has repeatedly issued nuclear threats against Ukraine and the West since launching its full-scale invasion in 2022. In November 2024, Putin approved updates to Russia&apos;s nuclear deterrence policy, outlining conditions under which Moscow could justify a nuclear strike, including aggression against Russia and its allies by a non-nuclear state with the support of a nuclear state.	https://kyivindependent.com/peskov-on-zelensky-negotiations/	2025-02-05T03:22:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1258775915.jpg
UK doesn't see Russia being 'serious about negotiations, peace'	London does not see indications that Russia is ready for serious negotiations about peace in Ukraine, U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said on Feb. 5 at a press conference in Kyiv attended by the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We do not see (that) Russia is serious about negotiations and serious about peace,&quot; Lammy said alongside his Ukrainian counterpart, Andrii Sybiha. &quot;And the conditions that were set out by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin last year was not any basis on which you could seriously expect a sovereign country to begin negotiations.&quot; Putin issued an ultimatum last June under which Ukraine was to entirely withdraw from the Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts as a condition for peace talks. Moscow illegally declared annexation of the four regions in September 2022 despite not fully occupying them. There are growing expectations of possible peace talks in 2025 as U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to broker a swift settlement. President Volodymyr Zelensky concurred that Kyiv would seek an end to the war this year but urged partners to help Ukraine negotiate from the position of strength. In a surprise turn, the Ukrainian president even recently acknowledged the possibility of sitting at the negotiating table with Putin if necessary to achieve peace. &quot;We in the United Kingdom have been at the forefront of supplying Ukraine with the military capability,&quot; Lammy said. &quot;The United Kingdom, of course, plays its full part to ensure that Putin does not come back.&quot; The U.K.&apos;s top diplomat is visiting Ukraine shortly after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer pledged to ramp up military support, promising more assistance in 2025 than ever before. London previously announced plans to deliver unprecedented military assistance to Ukraine this year, with 3 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) already committed for lethal aid. The British-Ukrainian cooperation was further cemented in January by the 100-year strategic partnership agreement, a wide-ranging deal that encompasses cooperation in military, energy, scientific, cultural, economic, and other sectors.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-doesnt-see-russia-being-serious-about-negotiations-peace/	2025-02-05T02:58:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2171444035.jpg
Azerbaijani airliner that crashed in December struck by Russian Pantsir missile, source tells Reuters	The Azerbaijani airliner that crashed in Kazakhstan in December after diverting from the Russian airspace was struck by a Russian Pantsir air defense missile, an undisclosed Azerbaijani official told Reuters in comments published on Feb. 4. The Azerbaijan Airlines plane was flying from Baku to Grozny in Russia&apos;s Chechen Republic before suddenly changing course and crashing on Dec. 25 near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan, killing 38 of the 67 people on board. The source revealed to Reuters that the Azerbaijani side possesses a fragment of a Russian Pantsir missile extracted from the crashed plane, adding that the analysis is underway. Kazakhstan&apos;s authorities on Feb. 4 released preliminary results of their analysis of available data, including the plane&apos;s black boxes. The conclusions pointed to a number of holes and dents in the aircraft and a collision with &quot;foreign metal objects.&quot; Baku has previously accused Russia of accidentally shooting down the plane and demanded an admission of guilt and reparations. Russian President Vladimir Putin called Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev soon after the crash, apologizing for the incident taking place in Russian airspace but stopped short of acknowledging responsibility. Aliyev later criticized Russia&#x2019;s handling of the incident, accusing its agencies of suppressing evidence and promoting &quot;absurd versions&quot; of events. He also criticized Russia for failing to close the airspace during a reported drone attack and highlighted poor coordination between its military and civil aviation services as factors contributing to the tragedy.	https://kyivindependent.com/azerbaijani-airliner-hit-by-russian-pantsir-missile-before-december-crash-source-tells-reuters/	2025-02-05T02:30:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190840075.jpg
38 countries announce 'major progress' on tribunal for Russian leadership	A coalition of 38 countries, including all EU members, announced on Feb. 4 that they had made &quot;significant progress&quot; toward establishing a special tribunal to prosecute Russian leadership for the crime of aggression against Ukraine, Euronews reported. &quot;No one from Russia and no one from Russia&apos;s leadership is untouchable,&quot; said Kaja Kallas, the EU&apos;s top diplomat. The tribunal, set to operate within the Council of Europe, will focus on Russia&apos;s political and military leaders, including President Vladimir Putin. &quot;To wait is not an option. We must really act as fast as possible. And we will do the best way to try to finish the work this year,&quot; said Council of Europe Secretary General Alain Berset. Legal experts are reportedly drafting a statute to define the tribunal&apos;s jurisdiction, with the document expected to be signed in April at the 14th meeting of the coalition participants. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been a strong advocate for the tribunal, seeking to hold Putin accountable for launching the full-scale invasion nearly three years ago. Ukrainian authorities have documented thousands of war crimes by Russian forces, including deliberate attacks on civilians, cultural sites, and medical institutions, as well as cases of torture and forced deportations. The International Criminal Court (ICC) has already issued arrest warrants for Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, the Russian official overseeing the forced deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia. In March 2024, the ICC also issued warrants for two Russian military commanders for strikes on Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure during the winter of 2022-2023. Unlike war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide &#x2014; charges that apply to individuals at all levels of a military conflict &#x2014; the crime of aggression is a charge that can be brought exclusively against the top leadership of an aggressor state.	https://kyivindependent.com/38-countries-push-forward-with-tribunal-to-prosecute-russian-leadership-over-aggression-euronews-reports/	2025-02-05T02:16:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1475813059.jpg
Ukraine strikes Russian oil facility, Buk air defense system overnight, military claims	Ukrainian forces struck a Russian oil facility in Krasnodar Krai and a Buk air defense system in the occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast overnight on Feb. 5, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said. An attack carried out by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and the Defense Forces set fire to the Albashneft oil facility in Novominskaya in southwestern Russia, according to the statement. Earlier the same day, Krasnodar Krai authorities reported a Ukrainian drone attack that started a fire at an unspecified oil depot that allegedly contained a &quot;residual amount&quot; of petroleum product. The village of Novominskaya lies roughly 250 kilometers (150 miles) from the front line in Ukraine. &quot;The hit has been confirmed,&quot; the General Staff said, describing the facility as a &quot;mini-refinery&quot; involved in the supply of gasoline and diesel fuel for Russian forces in Ukraine. The extent of damage to the facility is being determined. The General Staff also reported a successful hit against the Buk system in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, adding that &quot;damage to the target was recorded.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. The news comes as Ukraine is ramping up long-range drone strikes against Russian targets in the rear, focusing on oil facilities crucial for supplying the Russian military and feeding Moscow&apos;s war chest. Earlier this week, Ukrainian drone attacks reportedly targeted energy facilities in Russia&apos;s Astrakhan and Volgograd oblasts overnight on Feb. 3, causing fires at the Lukoil oil refinery in Volgograd and the Astrakhan Gas Processing Plant.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-russian-oil-depot-buk-air-defense-system-overnight-military-claims/	2025-02-05T02:11:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Tank.jpg
US provides 30% of Ukraine's weapons, domestic production covers 40%, Zelensky says	Around 40% of the weapons and equipment Ukraine uses on the battlefield are Ukrainian-made, while the U.S. contributes roughly 30%, President Volodymyr Zelensky told U.K. journalist Piers Morgan in an interview published on Feb. 4. &quot;This does not bring tranquility but rather a moral belief that we will not be left empty-handed, of course, without the support of the United States,&quot; Zelensky said. The president nevertheless hinted at serious consequences should Washington decide to withdraw assistance. &quot;The contribution from the United States to Ukraine&apos;s defensive capability and security is now around 30%. You can imagine what would happen to us without this crucial 30%,&quot; Zelensky said amid uncertainty about the Trump administration&apos;s continued support. The U.S. is Ukraine&apos;s largest military aid provider, supplying billions in security assistance since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration has been evasive about whether the new president plans to cut support after taking office. Aiming to reduce its reliance on foreign support, Ukraine has ramped up its domestic defense production over the past years. The country&apos;s 2025 budget allocated Hr 55 billion ($1.3 billion) for weapons production. Zelensky emphasized that continued assistance from partners remains critical and warned that any disruption in U.S. military aid could have dire consequences. &quot;Unfortunately, some delays occurred, but they eventually arrived, which allowed us to continue supporting our army, our Defense Forces, and... to defend against Russia,&quot; the president said. U.S. support to Kyiv has faced delays due to opposition from congressional Republicans and concerns within President Joe Biden&apos;s administration about escalating the conflict. A major obstacle in 2023-2024 was a $60 billion aid package caught in congressional gridlock, further complicated by a flawed weapons-tracking system that created confusion over the actual aid delivery.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-says-ukraine-produces-40-of-its-battlefield-weapons-us-provides-30/	2025-02-05T01:35:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1247185184-1678210924hwn53.jpg
‘Donbas is fiction’ — Kateryna Zarembo’s book dismantles Russian myths about Ukraine’s east	For some, Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts evoke images of coal mines, industrial sprawl, and Russian-speaking culture oriented toward Moscow. Yet to accept this as the regions&#x2019; defining reality is to ignore a deeper truth: a Ukrainian heritage that Russia has spent centuries attempting to erase. In the wake of independence, locals &#x2014; navigating the complexities of a democratic transition after decades of authoritarian rule &#x2014; sought to reclaim this identity, fostering a cultural revival that would gradually weave these regions more firmly into the national fabric. But in 2014, war brought that resurgence to a brutal halt. As Russia&apos;s war of aggression continues to devastate cities in both regions and force the remaining locals into occupation under the pretext of &#x201C;protecting&#x201D; the local Russian-speaking population from the Ukrainian government, understanding the true story of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts has never been more important. Kateryna Zarembo&#x2019;s &#x201C;Ukrainian Sunrise: Stories of the Donetsk and Luhansk Regions from the Early 2000s,&#x201D; now available in English translation, challenges the long-standing Soviet-era myths about Ukraine&#x2019;s east. Drawing from field research conducted leading up to the full-scale invasion, Zarembo illuminates how locals were in the process of reclaiming their regions&#x2019; Ukrainian identity. While Zarembo currently dedicates part of her time to volunteering as a combat medic with the Hospitallers battalion, she is, first and foremost, an academic. &#x201C;Ukrainian Sunrise&#x201D; reads like a scholarly work, yet the way it is written remains accessible to a broad audience. Her commitment to fieldwork and firsthand interviews makes the book a far more reliable resource on the people of the region than the perspectives of think tanks with opaque funding sources or journalists who parrot Russian talking points. Zarembo&#x2019;s approach ensures that the voices of those in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts are heard directly &#x2014; she serves not as an interpreter, but as a conduit for their stories. She opens &#x201C;Ukrainian Sunrise&#x201D; with a compelling takedown of the term &quot;Donbas,&quot; a label frequently applied to both regions as part of a larger whole. She contends that this historical term not only oversimplifies but also misrepresents the distinct identities of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, obscuring the diverse experiences of the people who called them home. A portmanteau of &#x201C;Donets Basin,&#x201D; the term &#x201C;Donbas&#x201D; has been in use since the 19th century and has referred not only to Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts but also parts of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and even regions of southern Russia. While the term conjures images of sprawling industrial cities for most people, Zarembo references the words of a Luhansk scholar who noted that several districts in his region north of the Siverskyi Donets River were known not for mining, but for their agricultural landscapes.

(HUM Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)&#x201C;The myth of Donbas deliberately erases the peculiarities of the region at the micro level and portrays it as a homogenous whole,&#x201D; Zarembo writes. &#x201C;In fact, residents of the region would be the first to say that &#x2018;Donbas&#x2019; and &#x2018;the Donetsk and Luhansk regions&#x2019; are not synonymous.&#x201D; The prevalence of the Ukrainian language in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts &#x2014; more than 60% according to a census conducted in the Russian Empire in the late 19th century &#x2014; persisted until the Holodomor man-made famine and Stalinist purges of the 1930s, which marked what Zarembo characterizes as an &quot;all-out&quot; assault on Ukrainian culture. During this period, Ukrainian teachers were branded as &quot;class traitors,&quot; and miners faced arrest for reading so-called &quot;nationalist literature.&quot; &#x201C;The region was too important for the Soviet Union to tolerate its Ukrainian identity. And not only Ukrainian identity: the Soviet myth of Donbas as an &#x2018;All-Union furnace&#x2019; not only rejected other identities, it also denied their very existence, except for heavy industry workers,&#x201D; according to Zarembo. To this day, the most enduring stereotype surrounding both regions is its singular identity as Ukraine&#x2019;s coal-mining heartland. While mine workers enjoyed relatively high salaries until the 1960s, the industry&#x2019;s profitability began to decline in subsequent decades. Lower wages, substandard coal quality compared to international benchmarks, and perilous working conditions shaped by inadequate regulations &#x2014; such was the stark reality of coal mining in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, far removed from its mythologized image. For many young people, mining became a profession of last resort, pursued only when other opportunities failed to materialize. Politicians attempted to perpetuate the &#x201C;miner&#x2019;s myth,&#x201D; into the years of Ukraine&#x2019;s independence, but as Zarembo writes, &#x201C;the coal mined in Donbas was so much higher than the price at which it was sold that the region received regular subsidies from the state budget, which peaked during the presidency of Viktor Yanukovych.&#x201D; Coal miners in Ukraine Soviet Republic, 1940s. (Mark Redkin/FotoSoyuz/Getty Images)Under Soviet rule, the pervasiveness of the Russian language in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts was meticulously cultivated through policies that marginalized and stigmatized the Ukrainian language. Yet, as Zarembo astutely observes, linguistic preference in the early 2000s did not serve as a definitive marker of political allegiance. Russian speakers could be patriotic Ukrainians who feel no deep affinity toward Russia, while Ukrainian speakers could be Euro skeptics. These complexities, Zarembo emphasizes, were not unique to Donetsk and Luhansk &#x2014; they were emblematic of broader dynamics throughout Ukraine at that time. The politics of historical memory was a mechanism through which these complexities often had to be navigated. In 2008, a proposal emerged to rename Donetsk National University in honor of Vasyl Stus, the 20th-century poet who grew up in Donetsk and died in a Russian penal colony in 1985. This initiative was championed by the student organization Poshtovkh (&#x201C;Impetus&#x201D; in Ukrainian), which had been founded just two years earlier in 2006, amid a national movement to reembrace Ukraine&#x2019;s historical memory, fostered by then-President Viktor Yushchenko. As one of its members reflects in the book, the group&apos;s mission was clear: &#x201C;We thought if we educated people about the history of the region and explained that Ukrainian culture was not inferior to Russian culture, then we would be contributing to the integration of this region into the general cultural landscape of Ukraine.&#x201D; Stus&#x2019; legacy in Donetsk was one of competing narratives, shaped by whether one&#x2019;s view was oriented toward the past or present. To those still tethered to the Soviet mindset, he was an enemy. But for those who envisioned a free and independent Ukraine, he stood not only as a talented poet but as a hero and martyr for Ukraine&#x2019;s struggle. Poshtovkh members, driven by a desire to honor Stus, collected nearly 1,500 signatures from students and faculty at Donetsk National University, and also earned support at the national level from key figures like Yushchenko. However, their campaign quickly became a flashpoint for regional political tensions. A lawmaker from the pro-Russian Party of Regions proposed instead that the university be named after a former first secretary of the regional Communist Party. Other members of the pro-Russian camp launched a series of heated roundtable discussions against the renaming of the university, all while distributing blue and yellow ribbons &#x2014; Ukraine&#x2019;s national colors &#x2014; as a defensive gesture against charges of anti-patriotism.

(Viktoria Synistra/AFP via Getty Images)The university administration, convinced that the students were &quot;agents&quot; of the Orange Revolution, which had bolstered Yushchenko&#x2019;s political rise, turned the campaign into an ideological battleground. In the end, the administration voted against the renaming, and efforts were made to discredit Poshtovkh in the eyes of the public. The resistance to cultural initiatives in Donetsk might seem baffling at first glance. Poshtovkh, for instance, faced staunch opposition not only when advocating for the renaming of the university but also when attempting to organize a Vertep festival &#x2014; a centuries-old Ukrainian Christmas tradition &#x2014; in the city&#x2019;s central square. As Zarembo points out, this hostility is rooted in the enduring legacy of Soviet myths about Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, myths that relegated culture to an &quot;unnecessary&quot; status for its vision of the industrial Donbas. These narratives, designed to erase local identity, left little room for expressions of Ukrainian heritage, reinforcing a landscape where cultural initiatives were viewed with suspicion. As such, the music, literature, and theater that emerged in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts can only be described as being part of what Zarembo calls an &#x201C;artistic underground&#x201D; or a &#x201C;cultural insurgency.&#x201D; These movements defied entrenched ideologies, striving to rejuvenate their cities and challenge the inertia of post-Soviet stagnation. One of the most prominent examples of cultural reinvention in Donetsk is the Izolyatsia cultural center, founded in 2010 on the site of a former mineral wool factory. The center&#x2019;s creation aimed to transform the factory from an industrial relic into a vibrant hub of social and cultural life. Through its innovative programming, Izolyatsia sought to shift the narrative of the region, using art as a lens for reimagining its identity.

(Dima Sergeev/Izolyatsia Must Speak)Some of Izolyatsia&#x2019;s artistic initiatives included inviting Chinese American artist Cai Guo-Qiang to create portraits of miners using gunpowder, or the art installation &#x201C;Lipstick&#x201D; by Cameroonian-Belgian artist Pascale Marthine Tayou, who dedicated it to the women of the region. A giant metallic red lipstick was installed on the top of the factory chimney, which Russian occupying forces would later blow up when they seized the premises. The Izolyatsia art center&#x2019;s singular, defining event was a Ukrainian literature festival held in late April 2014, despite the outbreak of the Russian invasion earlier that month. In a powerful act of cultural defiance against Russian aggression, some of Ukraine&apos;s most prominent literary figures, including Irena Karpa, Lyubko Deresh, and Kateryna Babkina committed to participating, embodying the resilience of Ukraine&apos;s intellectual and artistic spirit in the face of war. Just months later, the Izolyatsia team, which relocated to Kyiv, received the grim news that the center had been seized by occupying forces, and its invaluable collection of artworks had been destroyed. The site has then been transformed into a notorious prison, infamous for the unspeakable acts of torture committed within its walls. Donetsk-born journalist Stanislav Aseyev&#x2019;s memoir, &#x201C;The Torture Camp on Paradise Street,&#x201D; offers a chilling first-hand account of the brutality he endured during his own imprisonment at Izolyatsia. Much of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts has fallen under Russian occupation or been completely ravaged by over a decade of war. It remains unclear when peace will return to both regions as Russia advances along the front line and continues its assault. Yet, as Zarembo observes, these landscapes continue to find ways to evolve in the collective consciousness of Ukrainians, acquiring new meanings even amid all the destruction. A notable example is the Azovstal steel plant in Russian-occupied Mariupol, a site once criticized for its environmental impact. With the onset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, it was transformed into a powerful symbol of Ukrainian resilience, as outnumbered and outgunned soldiers entrenched themselves there during the Siege of Mariupol.

(Christopher Occhicone/Bloomberg via Getty Images)While many of those who sought to innovate Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts have been driven into exile due to Russia&#x2019;s occupation, they continue to serve their country &#x2014; either by contributing to cultural initiatives from elsewhere in Ukraine or by fighting for the country&#x2019;s future on the front lines. This current period of the war, marked by the targeted devastation of Ukraine&apos;s east, represents yet another chapter in a long history of hardship for Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Yet, as Zarembo suggests, there is always still room for hope. &#x201C;The history of the Ukrainian east demonstrates what this region has suffered from Russia every time it has tried to forge an alternative trajectory of development,&#x201D; Zarembo writes. &#x201C;And the stories in this book confirm what it could have been if not for Russian interference; it had had the ten years the people featured in this book talk about. These stories illustrate what the Ukrainian east can still become.&#x201D; Kateryna Zarembo&#x2019;s &#x201C;Ukrainian Sunrise Stories of the Donetsk and Luhansk Regions from the Early 2000s is now available in Tetiana Savchynska&#x2019;s English translation from Academic Studies Press.

US leading 'very constructive talks on Ukraine,' Trump says	The U.S. is in contact with both the Russian and Ukrainian leadership about the war, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 4, calling the talks &quot;constructive.&quot; &quot;But we are having very good talks, very constructive talks on Ukraine. And we are talking to the Russians. We&apos;re talking to the Ukrainian leadership,&quot; Trump said during a press conference in Washington with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump has pledged to broker a swift peace deal and end the full-scale war nearing its three-year mark but has not revealed specifics on how he plans to achieve that. Ukraine has said it is in contact with Trump&apos;s team and finalizing details for the first visit of a U.S. delegation, including a special presidential envoy, Keith Kellogg. The U.S. president also previously voiced intent to meet in person with Russian President Vladimir Putin, ending the diplomatic isolation imposed on the Kremlin&apos;s chief by former U.S. President Joe Biden. Moscow welcomed Trump&apos;s offer but said no concrete plans have been set for the meeting. &quot;This is an absolute slaughter that&apos;s taking place on the beautiful farmlands of Ukraine, and we have to stop it... It&apos;s a human tragedy, and we&apos;re going to try very hard to stop it,&quot; Trump said, reiterating his previous claims that the invasion would never have happened if he were in office at the time. Trump&apos;s past criticism of Biden&apos;s support for Ukraine and his open sympathies for the Russian leader have sparked concerns he might reduce assistance or cut a deal unfavorable to Kyiv. Since taking office, the U.S. president has adopted a more confrontational stance toward Moscow, threatening tariffs and sanctions unless Putin agrees to negotiate. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-leading-very-constructive-talks-on-ukraine-trump-says/	2025-02-05T01:03:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197672118.jpg
Ukraine should receive nuclear weapons if NATO entry is delayed, Zelensky says	The U.S. should provide Ukraine with an alternative security guarantee, such as nuclear weapons, if it is not ready to accept the country into NATO, President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested in an interview with U.K. journalist Piers Morgan published on Feb. 4. &quot;What kind of support package, what kind of missiles? Will they give us nuclear weapons? Then let them give us nuclear weapons,&quot; the president said when talking about possible guarantees instead of quick NATO entry. Zelensky acknowledged that Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession could be delayed &quot;for years or decades,&quot; raising the question of how the country would defend itself. Ukraine applied to join NATO at the outset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022 but has yet to receive an official invitation. Despite an allied pledge last year that Kyiv&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; countries such as the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia continue to resist its entry. Zelensky argued that while the West can supply Ukraine with missiles to deter Russia, their ability to stop Russian nuclear weapons is &quot;a rhetorical question.&quot; &quot;Let&apos;s do this: return (to) us nuclear weapons; give us missile systems; help us finance a million-strong army; or deploy your contingents in parts of our country where we want stability so that people feel safe,&quot; Zelensky said, outlining hypothetical alternatives. The Ukrainian president also pointed to the contradiction in Russia&apos;s justification for its invasion. &quot;Putin invaded because he was afraid that we would become NATO members. Well, we are not NATO members. Get out of our land,&quot; he said. The comments come after Zelensky criticized Ukraine&apos;s 1990s decision to give up its nuclear weapons without receiving robust security guarantees in return. Under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine relinquished the Soviet-era nuclear arsenal stationed on its territory and joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). In exchange, the U.S., U.K., and Russia provided security assurances. Twenty years later, Russia occupied Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine. Thirty years on, it is waging a full-scale war against Ukraine. The invasion has reignited discussions over whether Ukraine should develop nuclear weapons as a deterrent, though Kyiv maintains that NATO membership remains the best possible security guarantee and said it has no plans for building a new nuclear arsenal. As U.S. President Donald Trump pushes for negotiations to end the war this year, Russia has outlined that a complete ban on Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession is one of its key demands.	https://kyivindependent.com/if-nato-membership-delayed-ukraine-should-get-nuclear-weapons-instead-zelensky-says/	2025-02-05T00:52:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-05-at-9_21_22-AM-1.jpeg
8 killed, 70 injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks on multiple Ukrainian regions killed at least eight civilians and injured at least 70 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 5. Russia launched two ballistic missiles, as well as 104 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones, against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 57 drones over nine oblasts, while 42 others were lost in the airspace without causing damage, according to the statement. In Kharkiv Oblast, a missile strike on the town of Izium killed five people and injured 55, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Among the wounded are a 6-year-old boy and girls aged 14 and 16. The 14-year-old girl is in serious condition, while the others are in stable condition. Two more people were injured in other attacks across the region. In Donetsk Oblast, two civilians were killed in separate attacks in Pokrovsk and Druzhkivka, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. Another four people were wounded in the region over the past day. In Kherson Oblast, Russian attacks killed one person and injured eight others, regional Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian shelling wounded a 62-year-old woman in the Polohy district, the local military administration reported. Ukraine has faced daily Russian strikes targeting civilian areas, with regional authorities continuing to report casualties as Russia intensifies its offensive efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/8-killed-70-injured-in-russian-attacks-across-ukraine-over-past-day/	2025-02-04T23:44:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-04_17-06-01.jpg

US aid freeze halts support for prosecuting Russian war crimes, Ukraine's energy sector, lawmaker says	The Trump administration&apos;s foreign aid freeze impacted programs supporting the prosecution of Russian war crimes and the restoration of Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure after attacks, Ukraine-born Democratic Congressman Eugene Vindman said on Feb. 4, Ukrinform reported. Vindman&apos;s comments come days after billionaire Elon Musk claimed he had President Donald Trump&apos;s approval to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Shortly after taking office, the Trump administration effectively froze almost all foreign assistance for 90 days, halting USAID-funded projects worldwide while reviewing expenditures. Speaking at the Ukraine Week event in Washington, Vindman noted that the cuts include suspending U.S. assistance in war crimes investigations and halting support for international experts assisting in the process. Programs aimed at rebuilding Ukraine&apos;s infrastructure and power grid, damaged after Russian attacks, have also been suspended, Vindman said while calling on the administration to lift the restrictions. USAID, the U.S. government&apos;s primary foreign aid agency, has provided over $37 billion in support to Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, including $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and over $30 billion in direct budget support. The White House declared on Feb. 3 that &quot;under President Trump, the waste, fraud, and abuse ends now,&quot; accusing USAID of misusing taxpayer funds on supposedly &quot;ridiculous&quot; projects. The listed &quot;waste and abuse programs&quot; did not include anything related to Ukraine. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been named interim USAID administrator, reinforcing rumors that the agency will be merged with the State Department. In the meantime, Ukraine&apos;s parliamentary humanitarian and information policy committee has begun consultations with European partners to temporarily replace U.S. assistance. Vindman, a former U.S. Army officer, gained prominence as a whistleblower in the 2019 scandal involving Trump&apos;s phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky. In the call, Trump pressured Ukraine to launch an investigation into Joe Biden&apos;s family. Vindman was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives on Nov. 6, 2024 &#x2014; the same day Trump won the presidency and secured his return to the White House.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-admin-cuts-support-for-investigating-russian-war-crimes-rebuilding-ukraine-infrastructure/	2025-02-04T23:16:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2157665669.jpg
Ukraine's drone strike reportedly sets fire to Russian oil depot in Krasnodar Krai	An oil facility caught fire following a Ukrainian drone strike against Krasnodar Krai in southwestern Russia overnight on Feb. 5, local authorities and Telegram channels reported. The fire at the Albashneft oil depot was extinguished at 8:11 am Moscow time, the independent Telegram channel Astra reported, publishing a video of what appears to be a burning oil tank. The news comes as Ukraine is ramping up long-range drone strikes against Russian targets in the rear, focusing on oil facilities crucial for supplying the Russian military and feeding Moscow&apos;s war chest. &quot;Our forces repelled a Ukrainian drone attack.

(Andrii Kovalenko/Telelgram)The governor confirmed that a fire broke out but reported no casualties. The extent of damage to the facility is not immediately clear. The strike against the Albashneft oil depot was also reported by Andrii Kovalenko, the counter-disinformation chief at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. The village of Novominskaya lies roughly 250 kilometers (150 miles) from the front line in Ukraine. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry did not mention intercepting drones over Krasnodar Krai, reporting only two unmanned aerial vehicles downed over Kursk Oblast and two more over Belgorod Oblast. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Earlier this week, Ukrainian drone attacks reportedly targeted energy facilities in Russia&apos;s Astrakhan and Volgograd oblasts overnight on Feb. 3, causing fires at the Lukoil oil refinery in Volgograd and at the Astrakhan Gas Processing Plant.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-oil-depot-on-fire-after-reported-ukrainian-drone-strike-in-krasnodar-krai/	2025-02-04T22:50:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Tank.jpg

US won't rule out using American troops to 'take over' Gaza Strip, Trump says	In a stunning proposal on Feb. 4, U.S. President Donald Trump asserted that the United States &quot;will take over&quot; the Gaza Strip, potentially with the help of American troops. &#x201C;(The United States will) own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings,&#x201D; Trump said during a news conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump, who has repeatedly vowed to &quot;end the war&quot; in Ukraine and previously touted his record that the U.S. saw &quot;no wars&quot; during his first presidential term, said during the news conference that he will consider sending U.S. troops to the region &quot;if it&apos;s necessary.&quot; &quot;We&#x2019;re going to take over that piece, that we&#x2019;re going to develop it,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I do see a long-term ownership position, and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East, and maybe the entire Middle East,&quot; he added. Trump&apos;s comments, which come alongside Netanyahu&apos;s first visit to the United States since Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, mark a rapid reversal of Trump&apos;s 2016 campaign promise to remove American troops from the Middle East following the fallout of the Iraq war. When pressed on what Trump&apos;s plans were for the Palestinians living within the region, Trump said that he would turn it into &#x201C;the Riviera of the Middle East,&#x201D; rebuilding Gaza into a jobs and tourism leading region. The president added that neighboring countries Egypt and Jordan should play a role in resettling Palestinians &#x2014; both of which have previously said they are unwilling to accept refugees. Trump&apos;s comments come as Israel and Palestine have agreed to a ceasefire, as negotiations on prisoner exchanges continue. Following his election victory in November 2024, Trump proclaimed that he was &quot;going to stop the wars.&quot; &quot;We had no wars, for four years, we had no wars. Except we defeated ISIS,&quot; Trump said during his victory speech. Trump, who has a history of outlandish comments, said on Feb. 3 that he was seeking to have Ukraine supply the U.S. with rare earth minerals as a condition for aid for the war-torn country. &quot;We&apos;re looking to do a deal with Ukraine, where they&apos;re going to secure what we&apos;re giving them with their rare earths and other things,&quot; Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Feb. 3. Ukraine and its allies have been concerned about the future of U.S. aid under President Trump since he has repeatedly criticized former President Joe Biden for his administration&apos;s assistance to Kyiv. &#x200C;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-wont-rule-out-using-american-troops-to-take-over-the-gaza-strip-trump-says/	2025-02-04T20:48:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2154393954.jpg
Over 45,000 Ukrainian soldiers killed since start of war, Zelensky says	Ukraine has lost 45,100 soldiers on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with U.K. journalist Piers Morgan published Feb. 4. Zelensky added that there have been a total of 390,000 cases of soldiers sustaining wounds on the battle, although the actual number of wounded soldiers is less given that some soldiers sustained multiple wounds during separate incidents. In previous statements on the total casualty count, Zelensky said that approximately half of the soldiers wounded in action later return to the battlefield. The comments from Zelensky comes as a rare admission from a Ukrainian official about the casualty count on the front line. Zelensky previously revealed the total casualty count in December 2024, claiming that Ukraine had lost 43,000 solider, with &quot;370,000 cases of medical assistance for the wounded.&quot; Despite the estimates, Zelensky added that it was not clear as to how many thousands of men are currently held as prisoners of war compared to those missing in action. &quot;How many of those are missing (in action) and how many of those are prisoners (of war), I do not know the precise number but we are working on it,&quot; Zelensky added. Comparing Ukraine&apos;s casualty count to that of Russia, Zelensky said the interview that approximately 350,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, with between 600,000 to 700,000 instances of Russian soldiers sustaining wounds on the battlefield. According to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff estimates, Russia has lost a total of 842,930 troops since the start of the war, a number in line with various estimates from Western intelligence sources. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. According to the U.K.&apos;s estimates, Russian losses are expected to surpass 1 million troops by May. Moscow does not disclose its casualty figures, though a Defense Ministry official in recent months let slip that the department received 48,000 requests to identify missing soldiers. In an attempt to mitigate casualties among Russian citizens, Moscow has also made an effort to recruit foreigners into their army. Russia has cooperated with North Korea, with Pyongyang reportedly dispatching 10,000-12,000 soldiers to assist Russia with its war against Ukraine. After The New York Times reported on Jan. 30 that North Korean troops had been pulled from the front, a Special Operations Forces spokesperson confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that Ukraine&apos;s special forces had not faced Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers for three weeks. Despite this, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov denied reports on Feb. 4 that North Korean soldiers have not been seen on the front line for weeks, noting that the number of North Korean troops has decreased, and Ukraine is trying to establish why.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-45-000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-since-start-of-war-zelensky-says/	2025-02-04T18:24:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1251615116.jpg
Putin relaunches Soviet-era Intervision song contest amid Eurovision ban	Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Feb. 3 ordering the revival of the Intervision song contest, the Soviet Union&apos;s equivalent to Eurovision. The Eurovision Song Contest banned Russia from participation in 2022 following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Putin&apos;s order instructs officials to host Intervision in Moscow in 2025 for the purpose of &quot;developing international cultural and humanitarian cooperation.&quot; The decree appoints Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko as chair of the organizing committee and Deputy Chief of Staff Sergei Kiriyenko as chair of the contest&apos;s supervisory board. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed in December 2024 that over 25 countries had expressed interest in participating in Intervision, including several in Latin America. Mikhail Shvydkoi, Putin&apos;s culture envoy, previously claimed that all BRICS nations would take part. The original Intervision contest ran from 1965 until 1968, then again from 1977 to 1980. The competition served as the Soviet bloc&apos;s answer to Eurovision, which began in 1956 and is organized annually by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Russia first competed in Eurovision in 1994 and has sent many performers to the contest in the years since. Russian singer Dima Bilan is the country&apos;s only Eurovision winner, taking first place in 2008. Moscow hosted the competition the following year. Russia has been barred from Eurovision since the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Later that year, Ukraine won the song contest, but was unable to host the event in 2023 due to the ongoing war. &#xA0; Ukrainian artists have won Eurovision three times: Ruslana in 2004 with &quot;Wild Dances,&quot; Jamala in 2016 with &quot;1944,&quot; and Kalush Orchestra in 2022 with &quot;Stefania.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-relaunches-soviet-era-intervision-song-contest-amid-eurovision-ban/	2025-02-04T16:46:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1233050914.jpg
Russia's attacks on Ukraine's energy grid could cause nuclear accident, IAEA chief warns	Russia&apos;s continued attacks against Ukraine&apos;s power grid heighten the risk of a nuclear accident, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi warned during his visit to Kyiv on Feb. 4. &#xA0; Grossi is visiting Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian officials regarding nuclear safety in wartime before heading to Moscow to discuss the situation with Russian authorities. The visit marks his 11th mission to Kyiv since the launch of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. &quot;I&apos;m at Kyivska electrical substation&#x2014;an important part of Ukraine&apos;s power grid essential for nuclear safety,&quot; Grossi wrote on X. &quot;A nuclear accident can result from a direct attack on a plant, but also from power supply disruption.&quot; According to the IAEA, part of the purpose of the visit is to assess damage to infrastructure that plays a key role in Ukraine&apos;s nuclear safety. In a video filmed at the substation, Grossi said he was impressed with Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction efforts at the site despite the evident damage to critical infrastructure. Grossi also held meetings with President Volodymyr Zelensky, Energy Minister Herman Galushchenko, and Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha. Since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, Russia has relentlessly targeted Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure, ramping up attacks in the winter months. Recent drone and missile strikes have necessitated emergency blackouts across the country. &#xA0; These attacks and disruptions pose a risk to the safety of Ukraine&apos;s nuclear power plants, Grossi said. &quot;Having external power supply is essential,&quot; he said. &quot;And of course, the situation is quite dire. We should not, I think, hide that fact. Ukraine relies on nuclear power for more than half of its energy production, and Russia&apos;s ongoing attacks have increased the demand for nuclear energy &#x2014; while increasing the risk of nuclear disaster. Russian forces have occupied the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe&apos;s largest nuclear facility, since March 2022. The plant has been repeatedly disconnected from Ukraine&apos;s power grid due to Russian attacks on energy infrastructure, posing a serious hazard to nuclear safety. The IAEA has had a rotating mission at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant since September 2022. The agency has also sent teams to monitor other nuclear facilities in Ukraine due to Russia&apos;s intensifying assaults on the energy system.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-attacks-on-ukraines-energy-grid-could-cause-nuclear-accident-iaea-chief-warns/	2025-02-04T15:27:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197092868.jpg
He works for Putin' — Zelensky slams Tucker Carlson's pro-Russian commentary	Far-right American commentator Tucker Carlson is spreading misinformation and parroting Kremlin narratives, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with U.K. journalist Piers Morgan published Feb. 4. In a previous interview between Carlson and Morgan, Carlson accused Zelensky of behaving like a dictator by suppressing religious freedom and the rights of Russian speakers in Ukraine. &quot;That is all lies, that is all (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&apos;s narrative,&quot; Zelensky said in response. By regurgitating pro-Kremlin talking points, Carlson is &quot;misinforming&quot; the American public, Zelensky told Morgan. Zelensky also pointed out that Russia&apos;s full-scale war has hit territories in eastern Ukraine the hardest, meaning that Putin&apos;s violence has disproportionately targeted Russian speakers. &quot;Regrettably, this blogger or journalist, whatever he wants to call himself, he fully repeats the words of Putin. ... He works for Putin.&quot; Carlson, a conservative commentator and close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, is among the strongest pro-Russian voices in the U.S., spreading the Kremlin&apos;s unsubstantiated claims across a variety of platforms. Last year, Carlson aired interviews with both Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, allowing them to repeat debunked narratives of Ukrainian-Russian history unchallenged. Zelensky suggested that Carlson work to better understand Ukraine and stop circulating propaganda on behalf of the Russian government. &quot;It seems to me this journalist ... He needs to stop working for Putin, to stop licking his ass, honestly.&quot; &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/he-works-for-putin-zelensky-slams-tucker-carlsons-pro-russian-commentary/	2025-02-04T13:43:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1988745179.jpg
I consider him an enemy' — Zelensky says he's ready to sit opposite Putin in peace talks	President Volodymyr Zelensky is ready to sit at the negotiating table with Russian President Vladimir Putin if it is the only setup that will bring peace to Ukraine, the president told U.K. journalist Piers Morgan in an interview published Feb. 4. U.S. President Donald Trump has urged Zelensky and Putin to &quot;make a deal&quot; to end the war and has pledged to broker a ceasefire within the first six months of his term. Zelensky said Ukraine was ready to end the &quot;hot stage&quot; of the war and that its willingness to negotiate with Russia at all represented a compromise. &quot;We will be speaking with Putin. ... Even the conversation with Putin is a compromise,&quot; Zelensky told Morgan. When asked how he would feel sitting opposite Putin in an in-person meeting, Zelensky dismissed his personal sentiments on the matter. &quot;If that is the only setup in which we can bring peace to the citizens of Ukraine and not lose people, definitely, we will go for this setup ... What does it matter, my attitude to him?&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;I will not be kind to him, I consider him an enemy. And to be honest, I believe he considers me an enemy as well.&quot; Zelensky reiterated that the negotiaton process should include the Ukraine, the United States, the European Union, and Russia. He also said that Kyiv was not willing to acknowledge any occupied Ukrainian lands as Russian territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/i-consider-him-an-enemy-zelensky-says-hes-ready-to-sit-opposite-putin-in-peace-talks/	2025-02-04T12:50:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/zelensky.png
Ukraine war latest: Kyiv denies reports that North Korean soldiers have not been seen in Kursk Oblast for weeks	Key developments on Feb. 4: About 8,000 North Korean soldiers are still fighting against Ukraine in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said in an interview with The War Zone magazine published on Feb. 4. After The New York Times reported on Jan. 30 that North Korean troops had been pulled from the front, a Special Operations Forces spokesperson confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that Ukraine&apos;s special forces had not faced Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers for three weeks. Budanov denied reports that North Korean soldiers have not been seen on the front line for weeks. However, Budanov noted that the number of North Korean troops has decreased, and Ukraine is trying to establish why. &quot;We have to wait for some time to see if there are any real changes or if this is just lower activity for a couple of days,&quot; Budanov said. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in early August 2024. At least 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and another 2,700 wounded fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) claimed on Jan. 13 The heavy losses of the North Korean army may be related to its lack of combat experience and the tactic of human waves attacks with a limited amount of equipment, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief added. According to Budanov, North Korean soldiers attack &quot;almost without any combat vehicles.&quot; Budanov also suggested that the North Korean military is so willing to advance on foot against Ukrainian drones and artillery because of its loyalty to North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. He added that their disregard for personal safety makes Ukraine&apos;s defense more challenging. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force carried out a &quot;precision strike&quot; on Feb. 3 at a Russian command post near the village of Novoivanovka in Kursk Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. Kyiv launched a limited incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, &#xA0;first capturing about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukraine has reportedly lost around half of that territory since then, fighting continues in the region. The command post, located in an abandoned building, was used to coordinate Russian troops&apos; offensive against the Ukrainian army in the Kursk sector of the front line, the statement read. The building was severely damaged, and Moscow suffered significant losses among Russian personnel, the General Staff said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Earlier on Jan. 31, Ukrainian forces struck another command post of Russia&apos;s Kursk group of forces in the Russian city of Rylsk. These attacks are part of Ukraine&apos;s broader strategy to weaken Russian operational capabilities by targeting key command centers. The General Staff has emphasized that such strikes aim to reduce Russia&apos;s offensive potential. A Russian missile attack against the town of Izium in Kharkiv Oblast killed at least five people and injured at least 55 on Feb. 4, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Three children were injured in the attack, including a six-year-old boy and two girls, aged 14 and 16. The 14-year-old girl is in a serious condition, while the other two children are in a condition of medium severity, according to Syniehubov. The governor initially reported four people killed &#x2013; two men and two women. A fifth victim was reported later during the day when rescue services recovered another body from the rubble. A pregnant woman was among the killed, Syniehubov reported later. According to preliminary data, Russian forces used a ballistic missile in the attack, targeting the central part of the city, Syniehubov said. An administrative building suffered a hit, while another administrative building and several residential buildings were damaged, according to the governor. Syniehubov stressed that no military facilities were located in the targeted area. Izium, a town with a pre-invasion population of 45,000, lies in the southeastern part of Kharkiv Oblast, over 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the regional center, Kharkiv, and around 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of the front line. Russian courts received 20,000 claims in 2024 seeking to declare individuals missing or dead, marking a two-and-a-half increase from previous years, independent media outlet Mediazona reported on Feb. 4. Before the full-scale war, Russian courts handled approximately 8,000 such cases annually. The surge in filings, which began in mid-2024, represents the first significant rise in missing persons cases since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The figures hint at mounting Russian losses during the full-scale invasion, which various estimates place between 600,000 and 840,000 killed and wounded. Moscow does not publish its official casualty figures. According to Mediazona, most of the claims last year were initiated by Russian military unit commanders who sought to remove missing soldiers &#x2014; presumed dead but lacking official confirmation &#x2014; from personnel rosters. This process allows units to recruit replacements. Families do not need to consent to these legal declarations, which often leaves them without financial support or clear information about their relatives&apos; fate, the outlet wrote. The exact number of missing Russian soldiers remains unknown, as courts routinely withhold applicants&apos; names and avoid publicizing rulings. In 2024, an estimated 12,000 additional cases were recorded beyond the usual peacetime figures. More than 50,000 inquiries have been submitted by Russians seeking information about missing soldiers through Ukraine&apos;s &quot;I Want to Find&quot; project, Bohdan Okhrimenko, head of the Coordination Center Secretariat, said on Jan. 3. Initially launched in September 2022 as part of the &quot;I Want to Live&quot; hotline, which helps Russian soldiers surrender, the project was expanded to address requests from families searching for missing troops. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Anna Tsivilyova disclosed on Nov. 26 that her ministry had received 48,000 DNA test applications from relatives hoping to locate missing soldiers. Speaking at a Duma roundtable, Tsivilyova revealed that the DNA data was stored in a database, inadvertently providing a rare glimpse into the scale of Russian casualties. Andrei Kartapolov, head of the State Duma&apos;s defense committee, cautioned against publicizing such figures. &quot;This is sensitive information. When we finalize the documents, we must ensure these figures do not appear publicly,&quot; he said. According to the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, Russia has lost 842,930 troops since launching its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. Russian commanders in the Kupiansk sector are ordering their soldiers to retake positions from which they retreated under Ukrainian fire, threatening them with execution if they refuse, Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces claimed on Feb. 4, citing intelligence reports. Ukrainian soldiers forced Russian troops to abandon forward positions near a settlement in the Kupiansk sector following intensive assaults, the unit said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Russian forces intensified their assault on Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast in September 2024, pushing toward the city&apos;s industrial outskirts in the northeast. Ukrainian forces repelled several attempts to enter the town throughout December. The estimated Russian advance in the Kupiansk district, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine, as of Feb. 4, 2025. A white symbol marks the city of Kupiansk. (DeepState / OpenStreetMaps)For months, Russia has sought to establish a foothold along the eastern bank of the Oskil River, attempting to outflank Ukrainian defenses and open the way for a rear attack on Kupiansk. The front line now lies just two kilometers (1.5 miles) from the town. President Volodymyr Zelensky recently appointed Major General Mykhailo Drapatyi, the commander of Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces, to lead the Khortytsia group of forces as Ukraine works to counter Russian advances in the sector. Western and Ukrainian officials have pointed to poor morale among Russian troops since the outbreak of the full-scale war. Moscow employs the infamous &quot;human wave&quot; tactics in which its troops overwhelm Ukrainian defenders through sheer numbers despite suffering heavy losses. Reports of Russian commanders executing their soldiers have also surfaced amid some of the heaviest battles of the war, for example, during Russia&apos;s siege of the stronghold town of Avdiivka in late 2023.

Dates and participants being finalized' — Zelensky on upcoming US delegation visit	The Ukrainian government is finalizing details for the first visit of a U.S. delegation to Ukraine since Donald Trump&#x2019;s return to the White House, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a Feb. 4 press briefing in Kyiv, RBC Ukraine reported. Earlier on Feb. 2 Zelensky said that he was expecting Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, to visit Ukraine soon. Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office is communicating with Trump&apos;s team, Zelensky said, including Kellogg and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz. Kyiv has indicative dates for the arrival of American officials and is currently working on its arrangement, according to Zelensky. &quot;We are now finalizing the dates and the participants. We are waiting for the team and will work together,&quot; Zelensky said. Kellogg previously defined the &quot;near term&quot; end to the war as 100 days out from Trump&apos;s inauguration and said it was his personal and professional goal to help him broker a solution by that point.	https://kyivindependent.com/dates-and-participants-being-finalized-zelensky-on-upcoming-us-delegation-visit/	2025-02-04T12:00:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173926230.jpg

Trump wants Ukraine’s ‘rare earths’ — What critical materials does it actually have?	President Donald Trump came out on Feb. 3 saying he was looking to cut a deal with Ukraine by giving the war-torn country weapons and aid in return for its &#x201C;rare earths and other things.&#x201D; &quot;We&apos;re looking to do a deal with Ukraine, where they&apos;re going to secure what we&apos;re giving them with their rare earths and other things,&quot; Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. &quot;I want to have security of rare earths. We&apos;re putting in hundreds of billions of dollars. They have great rare earths. And I want security of the rare earths, and they&apos;re willing to do it,&quot; he said. It&#x2019;s unclear exactly what Trump meant by &#x201C;rare earths and other things.&#x201D; Ukraine is home to 20 of the world&#x2019;s critical minerals and metals like titanium used in the aerospace and defense industries and lithium, an essential component of electric vehicle batteries. Ukraine also possesses rare earth elements &#x2014; under which titanium and lithium do not fall &#x2014; such as cerium, yttrium, lanthanum, and neodymium. Demand for these materials has jumped in recent years as the world shifts to renewable forms of energy. Trump&#x2019;s interest in Ukraine&#x2019;s critical materials may lie in China&#x2019;s current dominance over the rare earth elements market. China controls 85-90% of rare earth elements from mining to refining. With his &#x201C;America First&#x201D; agenda, the new U.S. president may be looking to fuel American competitiveness by gaining an upper hand over Beijing. The global market for critical minerals is $320 billion and could double in the next five years, according to the World Economic Forum.

(Oliver Contreras / AFP via Getty Images)For Kyiv&#x2019;s part, President Volodymyr Zelensky has positioned Ukraine&#x2019;s natural materials as part of a peace plan. Reports late last year said Zelenksy&#x2019;s team had even delayed a deal on critical materials with former President Joe Biden&#x2019;s team so it could offer it to Trump in case he won the elections. &#xA0; But the quantity and extent of Ukraine&#x2019;s critical materials remain uncertain. Further exploration is needed to better understand their viability. What&#x2019;s more, Russia occupies large swaths of Ukraine&#x2019;s resource-rich territory. Ukraine&#x2019;s critical materials deposits are estimated to be worth $12 trillion, which could help expand the concentrated raw material market. The figure jumps up to $26 trillion when including all its natural resources like coal and natural gas. The country&#x2019;s numerous rare earth deposits are mostly spread across its central regions but are underdeveloped and the total value is unknown, according to an analysis from the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE). Russia also currently occupies 33% of Ukraine&#x2019;s rare earth sources. The $12 trillion figure, which was touted at the Davos forum last month, should be taken with a grain of salt. Much of these reserves are unexplored and the quality and quantity of the resources are speculative.

(Vincent Mundy/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Raw critical materials across Ukraine&#x2019;s government-controlled territories amount to nearly 120 million metric tons of explored or partially explored reserves and 305 million tons of preliminary estimated resources, according to KSE. This covers 46 titanium reserves, 34 polymetallic deposits, 11 graphite deposits, and two lithium deposits. Ukraine takes the top spot in Europe for titanium reserves and has a third of Europe&#x2019;s lithium reserves as well as 20% of global graphite resources. For nonferrous metals, it takes fourth place in Europe for copper, fifth for lead, sixth for zinc, and ninth for silver, according to the Finance Ministry. The embattled country is also the fifth-largest producer of gallium, used for semiconductors and LEDs, and is an important neon gas producer, supplying 90% of neon to the U.S. chip industry. Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion caused a global shortage of the gas, which was passed down to U.S. chip manufacturers. There are also deposits of materials critical for the nuclear industry. Ukraine has 1% of the global production of zirconium, as well as supplies of beryllium and uranium. According to the last government survey in 2005, the value of explored reserves of natural resources, including coal and gas, was around $150,000- 200,000 per capita, which translates to around $7-10 trillion at the time. An estimation by the American Chamber of Commerce last month put the critical mineral value at $3-26 trillion. Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky meets with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni (not pictured) in Rome, Italy, on Jan. 9, 2025. (Antonio Masiello/Getty Images)The issue, however, is geography. Raw materials are unevenly distributed across Ukraine and around $12 trillion has ended up in Russian-occupied territory, according to SecDev, a global digital risk and resilience firm. Russia occupies 42% of Ukraine&#x2019;s metals and 33% of its rare earths, as well as 63% of its coal deposits, 11% of its oil, and 20% of its natural gas, according to the American Chamber of Commerce. Moscow is eyeing up Ukraine&#x2019;s raw materials to fuel its overheating economy and has already stolen iron ore and coal. While it hasn&#x2019;t yet launched into extracting the critical material reserves, it is targeting infrastructure and blocking access to the materials to &#x201C;grind down&#x201D; Ukraine&#x2019;s economy, British intelligence said in July.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-wants-ukraines-rare-earths-what-critical-materials-does-ukraine-actually-have/	2025-02-04T11:22:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1156206150.jpg
Nearly 8,000 North Korean soldiers still fighting in Kursk Oblast, Budanov says	About 8,000 North Korean soldiers are still fighting against Ukraine in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said in an interview with The War Zone magazine published on Feb. 4.

At least 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and another 2,700 wounded fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) claimed on Jan. 13 The heavy losses of the North Korean army may be related to its lack of combat experience and the tactic of human waves attacks with a limited amount of equipment, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief added. According to Budanov, North Korean soldiers attack &quot;almost without any combat vehicles.&quot; Budanov also suggested that the North Korean military is so willing to advance on foot against Ukrainian drones and artillery because of its loyalty to North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. He added that their disregard for personal safety makes Ukraine&apos;s defense more challenging.	https://kyivindependent.com/nearly-8-000-north-korean-soldiers-still-fighting-in-kursk-oblast-budanov-says/	2025-02-04T11:20:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2156902890.jpg
Ukraine open to mining rare earths in cooperation with partners, Zelensky says	Ukraine is open to mining rare earths with its partners, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 4 during a press briefing in Kyiv, NV reported. Zelensky&apos;s statement comes after U.S. President Donald Trump said that Washington was seeking Ukrainian rare earths in exchange for aid. &quot;We are open to the idea that mineral resources can be developed with our partners who help us protect our land and push the enemy back with their weapons, their presence, and sanctions packages,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;This is absolutely fair. I talked about this back in September when we met with President Trump,&quot; Zelensky added. Zelensky&apos;s 10-point peace plan first presented in 2023 includes a clause on foreign investment in Ukraine&apos;s mining industry. Zelensky also noted that if Russia controls mineral resources on the international market, there is a possibility that companies from other countries, such as Iran or North Korea, will get involved. &quot;I know that they (American businesses) are really interested in entering Ukraine, and I would like them to develop this area here,&quot; Zelensky said. Trump did not previously specify what kind of rare earths the U.S. wants to acquire but said that Kyiv was ready to cooperate. Ukraine and its allies have been concerned about the future of U.S. aid under President Trump since he has repeatedly criticized former President Joe Biden for his administration&apos;s assistance to Kyiv. The U.S. is the largest backer of Ukraine&apos;s defense, having provided over $91 billion in aid, including over $62 billion worth of military assistance, since 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-ready-to-mine-rare-earths-in-cooperation-with-partners-zelensky-says/	2025-02-04T10:52:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1523446196.jpg
Explainer: Ukraine’s EuroMaidan was not a coup, despite Russian disinfo pushed by Musk	More than a decade after Ukraine&#x2019;s pro-democracy EuroMaidan Revolution, the false &#x2014; but persistent &#x2014; claim that the movement was a Western-backed &quot;coup&quot; refuses to die. Elon Musk on Feb. 2 boosted to his more than 215 million followers a post on X which parroted Russian disinformation, claiming without evidence that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had once been involved in toppling the Ukrainian government. Musk, who is leading an initiative for President Donald Trump to slash government spending, has repeatedly discredited the agency in recent days and is pushing for its shutdown. Research over the years has revealed that Russian propagandists have worked hard to spread the false narrative of a &#x201C;coup&#x201D; in Ukraine since 2014. With Musk taking a prominent position in the U.S. government, they now appear to have a sympathetic ear in the halls of American power. What Russian disinformation and its promotors ignore is clear evidence that the Euromaidan Revolution was organized spontaneously by Ukrainians in a grassroots fashion. Hundreds of thousands of people from all over the country and walks of life came together to spend three months in freezing temperatures to protest the undemocratic actions of their president and government. Rather than being violently or illegally forced out, as the term coup used by Musk and propagandists would suggest, Ukraine&#x2019;s then-president Viktor Yanukovych voluntarily fled the country to Russia after ordering his police forces to open fire on and kill civilian protestors. The subsequent transfer of power was carried out democratically through free and fair elections. Ukrainian riot police on Independence Square in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 19, 2014.

(Bulent Kilic/AFP via Getty Images)The Russian government also has a clear incentive to invalidate a pivotal moment in Ukraine&#x2019;s democratic history as it represents a shift away from Russian influence. Here&#x2019;s what actually happened, and how the Kremlin has worked to obfuscate the truth. Before the EuroMaidan protests began on Nov. 21, 2013, the Ukrainian government was preparing to sign an agreement that would integrate Ukraine more closely with the EU. Yanukovych had run on a platform of improving relations with the union when he was elected in 2010. Caving to economic pressure from Russia, Yanukovych suddenly abandoned these plans in favor of closer ties with Moscow. Hundreds of peaceful protesters gathered in Kyiv&#x2019;s Independence Square &#x2014; known as Maidan Nezalezhnosti in Ukrainian &#x2014; in response to Yanukovych&#x2019;s decision. An initial violent crackdown by Ukraine&#x2019;s riot police on Nov. 30, 2013, only fueled the protesters, who swelled in number to hundreds of thousands over the ensuing weeks. Protests spread to oblasts across the country, particularly among students and young people, and many made their way to Kyiv to join the protests happening in the country&#x2019;s capital.

(Serhii Mykhalchuk/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)As the protests continued, their demands expanded beyond European integration, and became a stand against corruption, injustice, and human rights violations, including the violent efforts by Ukrainian police to repress peaceful protests. In January 2014, to shut down the protests, Yanukovych and the parliament implemented laws restricting freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, which were deemed &#x201C;dictatorship laws&#x201D; in much of Ukraine and widely denounced around the world as anti-democratic. The protests lasted until that February, when Yanukovych ordered snipers of the Berkut special forces to open fire on protesters, killing over 100 people who are remembered as the &#x201C;Heavenly Hundred.&#x201D; Yanukovych fled to Russia in the immediate aftermath, and a parliament majority democratically voted to remove Yanukovych from office, calling for an early election that international observers declared free and fair. After Yanukovych left, a raid on his home revealed a staggering level of corruption. Ukrainian then-President Viktor Yanukovych in Kyiv, Ukraine, on May 17, 2010. (Sasha Mordovets/Getty Images)A photographer who was on the Maidan with protesters recalled to the Kyiv Independent on the tenth anniversary of the protests being injured by a rubber bullet while photographing snipers shooting at unarmed protesters. &quot;I understood that I was defending my rights, that I was standing for what they wanted to take away from me,&#x201D; he said. Russia seized on the events almost immediately, attempting to paint the EuroMaidan protests as a coup backed by the U.S. In Dec. 2013, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland said in a speech at a conference organized by the non-governmental organization U.S.-Ukraine Foundation that the U.S. had invested over $5 billion in Ukraine since the end of the Soviet Union in 1991 to &quot;ensure a secure and prosperous and democratic Ukraine.&quot; She praised the EuroMaidan movement in the same speech. Those comments &#x2014; and the U.S.&#x2019;s role in coups in other countries in the past &#x2014; have been used by propagandists to claim that Washington funded the EuroMaidan protests. Despite attempts to portray it otherwise, the $5 billion spent in Ukraine was unrelated to the protests. The funds went to supporting fair elections, funding anti-corruption efforts, and developing the country&#x2019;s energy infrastructure over the years.

(Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images)Nuland later clarified in April 2014: &#x201C;We certainly didn&#x2019;t spend any money supporting the Maidan. That was a spontaneous movement, which is a far cry from what we are concerned Russia is up to now in eastern Ukraine.&#x201D; At the time of her speech, Russia had already illegally invaded and annexed Crimea and was sending troops to eastern Ukraine. Around the same time, a hacked phone call between Nuland and U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt was posted on YouTube. In the recording, Nuland and Pyatt discuss goals for Ukraine&#x2019;s political future and their efforts to steer Ukrainian opposition political figures toward various positions in a new post-revolution government. While the leak was embarrassing for the Americans and revealed the U.S. was seeking more involvement in Ukraine&#x2019;s political future than it publicly let on, the contents of the call do not support Russian claims that the U.S. was involved in backing a coup. Timothy Snyder, a professor of history at Yale University specializing in the history of Central and Eastern Europe, said a few weeks after the leak: &#x201C;What that telephone conversation showed was that the Americans were, A, not up to date about what was happening in Ukraine and, B, unable to influence events happening in Ukraine.&#x201D; Many of the scenarios the Americans were hoping for in the call did not end up happening, he noted. &#x201C;Imagine just how much evidence the Russians have of what the U.S. was doing in Ukraine, given that they had access to that telephone call. That was the best bit they could come up with,&#x201D; Snyder also said at the time in reference to the leak.

(Etienne De Malglaive/Getty Images)The U.S. blamed Russia for the hack, noting that a Russian official was the first to spot and point it out online, and a transcript posted with the video was in Russian. Nuland and Pyatt appeared once again in Russian propaganda narratives after the two were photographed offering food to the protesters in Kyiv. The gesture was intended as a show of support and solidarity for democracy after the anti-democratic violent crackdown by Ukrainian authorities. Russian commenters online used it to disparage protestors as having &#x201C;sold out&#x201D; to Washington. Eleven years after the protests, claims that EuroMaidan was a coup continue to persist. His Feb. 2 social media post isn&apos;t the first time Musk has pushed these narratives. In 2023, he prompted pushback from Ukrainian authorities after he posted online in reference to Ukraine that there was &#x201C;no question that there was indeed a coup.&quot; Advisor to Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office Mykhailo Podolyak responded by telling him to read less Russian media, saying: &#x201C;Enslaved societies take to the streets to rid themselves of repressive states. This is the basis of freedom, Elon Musk. &quot;There have never been coups in Ukraine, but there have always been free people.&#x201D; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump&apos;s nominee for health secretary, also repeated the false claim that the U.S. spent $5 billion on a coup in Ukraine in an interview with far-right American political commentator Tucker Carlson in 2023.

(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)It&#x2019;s no accident these propaganda statements have taken root. Russia has carried out a coordinated campaign for years to amplify these claims. Detector Media found that official Russian channels on social media have been claiming EuroMaidan was a coup using the propaganda tactic of &#x201C;relentless repetition,&#x201D; disseminating these messages on many accounts representing a variety of organizations in different countries. These comments are pushed in various languages to reach broad audiences. These comments have also been echoed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and other high-ranking officials over the years, including just two months ago by Russia&apos;s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov during an interview hosted by Carlson.	https://kyivindependent.com/explainer-ukraines-euromaidan-was-not-a-coup-despite-russian-disinfo-pushed-by-musk/	2025-02-04T10:20:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-470193947.jpg
Italy allocates over $2 million to strengthen Ukraine's energy system	Italy has signed an agreement with the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) to launch a 2 million euro ($2.07 million) project to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s energy system, the Italian Embassy in Ukraine told the Kyiv Independent. Russia has consistently attacked Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure since 2022, resulting in nationwide power outages and causing an energy deficit. The project, funded by the Italian government, aims to make Ukraine&apos;s energy system &quot;more resilient and decentralized&quot; in accordance with the &quot;Build Back Better&quot; principle. The initiative provides for a detailed analysis of opportunities for integrating renewable energy sources into Ukraine&apos;s energy system, said Italian Ambassador to Ukraine Carlo Formosa, who participated in the signing of the agreement with the U.N. &quot;Advanced technological tools will be explored to improve energy efficiency and reduce consumption in order to create a model for more sustainable energy planning for cities,&quot; he said. The project includes training and technology transfer involving Italian and Ukrainian experts to enhance local expertise in sustainable energy management, the statement read. The program will also support the Ukrainian government in developing a long-term policy for the energy transition and attracting investment in the renewable energy sector, according to Formosa. There were two large-scale Russian attacks on energy infrastructure over the past month, as well as smaller attacks, but due to the warm weather, the Ukrainian energy grid was able to operate without scheduled blackouts.	https://kyivindependent.com/italy-allocates-over-2-million-to-strengthen-ukraines-energy-system/	2025-02-04T10:13:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-04-at-3_30_41-PM.png
Ukraine won't hold elections until Russia's war is over, Ukraine's envoy to US says	Ukraine won&apos;t hold elections until Russia&apos;s war is over, Ukraine&apos;s Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova told Suspilne in an interview published on Feb. 4. Markarova&apos;s statement comes after Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, called for parliamentary and presidential elections in Ukraine by the end of the year, especially if Kyiv reaches a ceasefire deal with Moscow. Elections are banned from being held in Ukraine during martial law, which has been in effect since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. The U.S. hasn&apos;t yet discussed with Ukraine the necessity of holding elections by the end of 2025, according to Markarova. &quot;Ukraine and America are free countries. Everyone can speak their mind. If this issue is addressed, we are certainly ready for this discussion, as we have done before. We will be very happy if elections are held in Ukraine because it will mean that we have won this war,&quot; Markarova said. Kellogg previously argued that most democratic nations hold elections during wartime and that doing so would strengthen Ukraine&apos;s democracy. Under martial law, presidential, parliamentary, and local elections are banned in Ukraine. If martial law had not been imposed, a presidential election would have been held on March 31, 2024, and President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s term would have ended on May 20, 2024. To be able to hold elections during martial law, Ukraine would need to make changes to the legislature, as well as set up infrastructure for Ukrainian refugees abroad, military personnel on duty, and Ukrainians living in areas close to the war zone to be able to vote. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Russian attacks have destroyed some of Ukraine&apos;s electoral infrastructure. Ukraine does not currently have the appropriate infrastructure or mechanism to organize elections that guarantee all citizens&apos; electoral and political rights, according to Ukrainian Civili Network Opora. Earlier on Jan. 2, Zelensky suggested that if the &quot;hot phase of the war is over,&quot; the parliament could lift martial law and set a date for elections.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-wont-hold-elections-until-russias-war-is-over-ukraines-envoy-to-us-says/	2025-02-04T08:59:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/markarova.jpg
Europe must act on Russian LNG before Trump makes it impossible	Europe&#x2019;s window to ban Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) is closing faster than we think. As a second Trump administration takes shape, Europe&apos;s opportunity to impose new, meaningful measures on Russian fossil fuels is rapidly diminishing. U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s plan to end the war allegedly includes offering sanctions relief in exchange for peace. Whether true or not, Europe will soon lose its ability to act independently on energy sanctions as they become bargaining chips in a twisted geopolitical game of poker. After nearly three years of full-scale war, Western sanctions on Russia are at a turning point. Keith Kellogg, Trump&#x2019;s newly appointed envoy to Ukraine, has reportedly crafted a strategy that includes lifting certain sanctions as part of a negotiation process. This approach would undermine the leverage that Western nations &#x2014; especially the European Union &#x2014; have painstakingly built over the past three years. But whether Europe or Ukraine agrees with this strategy is irrelevant. This is Trump. We must plan for the world as it is, not as we wish it to be. Regardless of Trump&#x2019;s recent rhetoric and threats, Western sanctions on Russia are likely at &#x2014; or near &#x2014; their peak. Russia is currently subject to some 20,000 Western restrictions, but only a small subset &#x2014; mainly financial and energy sanctions &#x2014; carry significant weight. Within this landscape, one glaring issue remains: Russian LNG imports to Europe. These imports not only finance the Kremlin&#x2019;s war in Ukraine but also fund Russia&#x2019;s ongoing sabotage, attacks, and assassinations on European soil. Despite the EU&#x2019;s stated goal of reducing reliance on Russian energy, European purchases of Russian LNG have surged in recent months, undermining Europe&#x2019;s own industrial security. Every shipment of Russian LNG that enters European ports funnels revenue into the Kremlin&#x2019;s war chest. The danger of inaction is clear. If reports of a 100-day or six-month negotiation window are accurate, Europe may soon lose the ability to ban Russian LNG altogether. Once negotiations begin, a Trump administration is unlikely to support new, hard-hitting measures that could complicate talks. Imagine a scenario in which world leaders finally begin serious peace talks in the coming months. Would the West impose a new ban on Russian LNG in that context? Clearly not. The time to act is now &#x2014; before negotiations begin &#x2014; while Europe still holds the cards. Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) and U.S. President Donald Trump (R) arrive for a group photo at the G20 Osaka summit in Osaka, Japan, on June 28, 2019. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images)Some may argue that banning Russian LNG now is futile if it could later be reversed in a peace deal. This view overlooks two key points. First, implementing a ban now would significantly strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s negotiating position. Second, banning Russian LNG would accelerate energy diversification across Europe, establishing new trade patterns that would be difficult &#x2014; and unwise &#x2014; to undo, even in the event of a future agreement. The Trump administration is likely to pressure Europe to adopt its own sanctions policy, even at the expense of European interests. The U.S. has a history of urging the EU to dilute its measures, as seen with the oil price cap, which replaced the EU&#x2019;s original plan for a full ban on Russian oil trade. By taking decisive action now, Europe can assert its autonomy and safeguard its long-term financial and strategic interests. By banning Russian LNG imports &#x2014; potentially as part of its upcoming 16th sanctions package &#x2014; the EU would send a strong message of unity and resolve to Moscow. To ensure a smooth transition, Ukrainian civil society encourages the European Commission to establish a fund to support member states and industries in moving away from gas and to strengthen energy partnerships with Ukraine, particularly in renewable energy development and grid interconnection. The EU has taken a measured, long-term approach to phasing out Russian fossil fuels, carefully securing consensus and imposing bans incrementally. But the return of chaos agent Donald Trump forces the European Commission to make a critical decision. It can continue enabling Russia&#x2019;s war machine through LNG imports &#x2014; or it can take bold action to sever this toxic lifeline once and for all.

US producers, Saudi Arabia resist Trump's push for increased oil production, WSJ reports	American oil producers and Saudi Arabia are pushing back against U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s call to ramp up oil production, signaling reluctance to align with his strategy to lower global energy prices, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Feb. 3. Trump has repeatedly called for lowering oil prices by increasing production, arguing that undercutting Russia&apos;s oil revenue would force Moscow to end its war against Ukraine. While major oil companies were among Trump&apos;s top campaign donors, their priority is regulatory relief and long-term market stability rather than an immediate production surge, sources told the WSJ. U.S. shale producers have reportedly informed the White House that they do not plan to expand drilling, despite Trump&apos;s rhetoric about boosting output. Saudi Arabia has also conveyed its reluctance to increase production. According to the WSJ, Riyadh has privately informed former U.S. officials that it does not intend to ramp up output, a position that has been passed on to the current administration. Speaking via video link at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan. 23, Trump said he would ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to lower oil prices, claiming it would bring an immediate end to the war in Ukraine. OPEC, which includes 12 member states, including Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, controls about 30% of the global oil supply and can significantly influence prices through production adjustments. Trump&apos;s energy policy aligns with broader efforts to increase pressure on Russia&apos;s economy. Keith Kellogg, the incoming U.S. peace envoy, told Fox News on Jan. 24 that stricter measures targeting Russia&apos;s oil industry could weaken the Kremlin&apos;s financial standing and force it into negotiations. Trump has claimed that his team has already held &quot;very serious&quot; discussions with Russian officials about the war in Ukraine and suggested that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin could soon take &quot;significant steps&quot; toward ending the conflict. Putin said on Jan. 24 that Russia is ready for talks with Trump, whom he described as having a &quot;pragmatic and trusting&quot; relationship with Moscow. Reuters reported on Jan. 23 that Putin is increasingly concerned about Russia&apos;s economy, citing five undisclosed sources. Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Trump could fulfill his promise to end the war, but only if Ukraine is included in negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-calls-for-lower-oil-prices-to-end-ukraine-war-us-producers-reject-expansion-wsj-reports/	2025-02-04T05:50:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182697515.jpg
Emergency power shutdowns introduced in 8 oblasts due to Russian attacks	Emergency energy power shutdowns were introduced in eight Ukrainian oblasts due to higher consumption and Russian attacks on the country&apos;s energy system, Ukrenergo, Ukraine&apos;s state grid operator, reported on Feb. 4. The news comes as Ukraine&apos;s power grid continues to recover from past Russian missile and drone strikes, with restoration work continuing at power facilities. The most recent Russian attacks inflicted damage to electricity generation and transmission facilities, leading to power cutoffs, Ukrenergo wrote. Electricity consumption is also growing as temperatures in Ukraine drop below zero. The emergency shutdowns were introduced in the Kharkiv, Sumy, Donetsk, Poltava, Zaporizhzhia, and Kirovohrad oblasts, as well as partially in the Dnipropetrovsk and Cherkasy oblasts, Ukrenergo said on Telegram. The grid operator Ukrenergo asked Ukrainians to reduce electricity consumption between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. to prevent electricity shortages. Scheduled blackouts were common across Ukraine when Russia launched mass attacks on the country&apos;s energy system in the fall and winter of 2022-2023 and in the spring-summer period of 2024. These attacks also led to heat, water, and mobile network disruptions throughout Ukraine. This winter was expected to be one of the war&#x2019;s toughest, with blackouts potentially lasting up to 20 hours a day. For now, Ukraine has managed to avoid predicted winter blackouts due to warm weather and Ukraine&apos;s improved ability to protect and quickly repair its energy infrastructure despite continued Russian attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/emergency-power-shutdowns-introduced-in-8-oblasts-due-to-russian-attacks/	2025-02-04T05:45:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1247620473.jpg
Raiffeisen Bank reports first loss in 9 years after Russian court ruling, Bloomberg reports	Raiffeisen Bank International reported its first quarterly net loss in nine years after allocating $867 million for an adverse court ruling in Russia, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 4. Raiffeisen is the largest Western bank still operating in Russia. While it initially hesitated to withdraw from the Russian market, the bank announced in July 2024 that it would &quot;drastically&quot; scale down its business in the country. The Austrian lender reported a net loss of 926 million euros ($955 million) in the fourth quarter of 2024, primarily due to provisions in its Russian subsidiary. &quot;The business reduction in Russia is making good progress,&quot; CEO Johann Strobl reportedly said. Russian court rulings have complicated the bank&apos;s withdrawal. In September 2024, a court issued a preliminary decision blocking the transfer of Raiffeisen&apos;s shares, which the company said would &quot;inevitably lead to further delays&quot; in its exit. Russian government restrictions also prevent Raiffeisen from transferring its Russian earnings to its parent company in Austria. As a result, the bank has accumulated 4.4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) in excess capital within Russia, Bloomberg reported. Raiffeisen&apos;s Russian branch earned over $1 billion in the first three quarters of 2023 &#x2014; about 50% of the group&apos;s total profits &#x2014; and paid 277 million euros ($284 million) in taxes to Russia over the same period. Bloomberg previously reported on Feb. 3 that Raiffeisen Bank&apos;s Russian subsidiary cooperates with companies supplying the Russian military.	https://kyivindependent.com/raiffeisen-bank-reports-first-quarterly-loss-in-nine-years-after-russian-court-ruling-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-04T05:28:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1250736178.jpg
Less than half of Poles support continued military aid to Ukraine, survey shows	The number of Poles backing continued military assistance to Kyiv dropped from 54% to 49% over the course of 2024, according to a survey commissioned by the Mieroszewski Center in Poland and published on Feb. 4. While in February 2024, 36% of respondents said &quot;rather yes&quot; and 18% &quot;definitely yes&quot; to a question of continued military support, the numbers went to 33% and 16% by December, respectively, according to the research carried out by the ARC Rynek i Opinia group. In turn, 11% said &quot;no&quot; and 15% leaned toward &quot;no&quot; in February 2024. These numbers went up to 16% and 19% in December. Poland has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, providing extensive military, humanitarian, and political assistance. The Polish-Ukrainian relations have been nevertheless strained in the past few years by resurgent historical grievances and trade disputes. Other statistics in the survey also show a mild deterioration of Polish-Ukrainian relations. The number of Poles in favor of continued assistance to Ukrainian refugees went from 42% to 40%, while those in opposition increased in numbers from 33% to 37%. According to an earlier survey from the start of the full-scale war, 94% of Poles supported aiding Ukrainian refugees in March 2022. Almost 1 million Ukrainian refugees are registered in Poland as of January 2025, according to U.N. data, making it second only to Germany in terms of numbers. The survey also shows that the number of Poles with negative attitudes toward Ukrainians went from 27% to 30%, while those with positive attitudes dropped by two percentage points to 23%. These figures are largely in line with earlier surveys in Poland and other countries supporting Ukraine, which also show a steady decrease in support for the Ukrainian military effort and refugees. Several Western leaders have warned against the growing fatigue as the full-scale war nears its third anniversary and urged steady resolve in supporting Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/less-than-half-of-poles-support-continued-military-aid-to-ukraine-survey-shows/	2025-02-04T05:16:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1742556453.jpg
Ukraine’s robotic army is bringing the fight to Russia	Ukraine has become a war lab for the future since the onset of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Driven by necessity, it has had no choice but to rely on rapid innovations to fight back. As a result, Ukraine is at the forefront of military technology, leveraging robotics and automation to redefine modern warfare and serve as a testing ground for future combat technologies. As it continues to develop and deploy cutting-edge unmanned systems, the world is closely watching how these advancements shape the battlefield. Given that Ukraine is already using AI-enabled drones, the deployment of autonomous ground robots may become a reality sooner than expected. Now, Ukraine is building a robotic army, aiming to have more than 200 uncrewed ground vehicles (UGVs) in operation by the end of the year. As it continues deploying these robots, it is gathering valuable data and insights that will shape the development of future autonomous systems. This experience positions Ukraine to train AI models and lead the way in deploying next-generation autonomous robots when the time comes. In a November 2023 interview with The Economist, former Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi described the war as &quot;positional,&quot; warning that the prolonged conflict threatens not only Ukraine&apos;s military but the survival of the state itself. He said breaking the deadlock would require a major technological leap. With dwindling Western arms supplies and a resource-rich adversary, Ukraine is turning to technology to level the playing field. What started with drone warfare has expanded to advanced robotic systems, marking a new chapter in Ukraine&#x2019;s fight against a much larger invader. In December 2024, Ukrainian forces reached a milestone by launching their first successful attack on Russian positions using only ground and FPV drones &#x2014; demonstrating the growing sophistication of Ukraine&#x2019;s unmanned warfare. According to Sgt. Volodymyr Dehtiarov of the Khartiia Brigade, dozens of robotic and unmanned systems, including machine-gun-equipped ground drones and kamikaze FPV drones, were deployed near Lyptsi, north of Kharkiv. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) commented on the attack, writing, &quot;Ukrainian officials have repeatedly highlighted Ukraine&apos;s efforts to utilize technological innovations and asymmetric strike capabilities to offset Ukraine&apos;s manpower limitations in contrast with Russia&apos;s willingness to accept unsustainable casualty rates for marginal territorial gains.&quot; While Russian casualties have surpassed 750,000, Ukraine continues to innovate with systems like the Honey Badger unmanned ground vehicle &#x2014; an explosive-laden robot designed to infiltrate and neutralize armored targets. Recognizing the potential of such advancements, Ukrainian authorities established the BRAVE1 defense innovation initiative in spring 2023 to streamline cooperation between the military, state institutions, private sector developers, and investors, fostering a more efficient and coordinated approach to defense technology. Ukraine previously used a ground robot to help assault a Russian trench in Kursk Oblast in September 2024. With a significant manpower disparity along the nearly 1,300-kilometer (800-mile) front line, Ukraine has no choice but to maximize its technological capabilities, deploying an array of unmanned systems to support its forces. One Ukrainian official noted that &quot;Ukraine has made the most of turning industrial disadvantage into a furnace of innovation.&quot; Ukrainian soldiers from the Ukrainian military&apos;s 121st Brigade load a Vampire drone with an anti-tank mine to target Russian positions in Krasnohorivka, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on July 22, 2024.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)Technological advancements in the war have moved quickly, but a key challenge is organizing research, development, testing, and the integration of various systems across all units. In February 2024, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky created the National Unmanned Systems Forces (USF), appointing Col. Vadym Sukharevskyi as commander in June 2024. Ukrainian startups are playing a crucial role in advancing battlefield technology, with around 250 companies contributing to the war effort. One such startup developed an unmanned ground vehicle called the Odyssey in just four days in a shed, costing only 10% of what an imported model would. &quot;We are fighting a huge country with no resource limits. We know we cannot afford to lose many lives,&quot; said Denysenko, head of the defense startup UkrPrototyp. The BRAVE1 initiative has already successfully tested more than 50 ground-based systems. UNITED24, the fund launched by Zelensky, also began raising money for a ground-based robotic platform, noting, &quot;These robots aim to save lives on the battlefield and among civilians by serving as logistical support, evacuators, mine layers, and deminers, as well as combatants.&quot; Warfare is entering an era where victory may no longer depend on manpower but on the ability to sustain and replenish robotic assets. Future conflicts may be fought until one side can no longer afford to replace its machines &#x2014; an unsettling yet increasingly plausible scenario in modern warfare. This shift is evident in how drones are used on the battlefield. Ukrainian drone operators, stationed miles behind the front lines, are orchestrating strikes with precision from a distance &#x2014; highlighting the radical transformation of 21st-century warfare. Just as British redcoats once used volley fire to dominate spear-wielding adversaries in the 18th century, today&apos;s conflicts are seeing a similar technological disparity, where unmanned systems grant those with superior technology a decisive advantage. However, robots alone cannot solve Ukraine&apos;s manpower shortages. Still, Ukraine is actively working to develop a force of battlefield robots to minimize human involvement and save lives. As one Ukrainian official explained, &quot;We count people, and we want our people to be as far from the front line as we can.&quot; Ukraine plans to deploy tens of thousands of uncrewed robotic ground vehicles this year to transport supplies, evacuate wounded soldiers, and support infantry in trench warfare, according to Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov. These buggy-like vehicles, already in use along the front and in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, help reduce risks to troops under heavy Russian shelling and drone attacks. Fedorov, who has played a key role in overseeing Ukraine&#x2019;s drone procurement, has been a leading force in fostering private-public innovation in military technology throughout the war. Ground-based robots are poised to play an increasingly critical role in Ukraine&apos;s war effort, excelling at tasks like loitering &#x2014; remaining in high-risk areas for extended periods, something human soldiers struggle to do safely. These robotic systems are used for reconnaissance, persistent surveillance, and logistics, such as delivering supplies and evacuating wounded soldiers under fire. Unlike humans, robots can operate tirelessly and withstand prolonged exposure to dangerous environments, providing continuous battlefield support. Retired U.S. Army Gen. Mark Milley has projected that robotic systems could make up a third of the U.S. military within the next decade, underscoring the broader implications of Ukraine&#x2019;s technological progress. Despite these groundbreaking advancements, Ukraine&apos;s success still depends on sustained Western support to strengthen its battlefield position ahead of potential peace negotiations. Its resourcefulness and ability to rapidly develop and deploy cutting-edge unmanned systems have positioned Ukraine as a potential global leader in modern warfare technology. If Ukraine emerges from this war as a free and sovereign state, it is well-positioned to become a powerhouse in developing next-generation combat systems that could shape military doctrine for years to come.

Yanukovych's son made billions selling coal from occupied Ukrainian territories, media reports	Oleksandr Yanukovych, the son of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, has made billions selling coal from Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories to Turkey, independent investigative outlet Important Stories reported on Feb. 4. Viktor Yanukovych was Ukraine&apos;s pro-Kremlin president from 2010 to 2014 before fleeing to Russia with his family in the wake of the EuroMaidan Revolution. In October 2024, reports emerged that Yanukovych Jr. had been granted Russian citizenship. The company behind the coal exports, Energoresurs, is registered in Rostov-on-Don, Russia, and has exported nearly half a million tons of coal abroad between 2023 and 2024. According to the investigation, the firm sources coal from suppliers in occupied Donbas and transports it to Turkey by rail and sea. Journalists linked Energoresurs to Yanukovych Jr. through his coal holdings and mining enterprises. The company also received a loan from the Cypriot firm SL Holdings Limited, allegedly controlled by individuals close to the ex-president&apos;s son. The coal is reportedly sold to an offshore company, Energy Union, registered in the British Virgin Islands. Energoresurs sells the coal at a significantly low price &#x2014; an average of $60 per ton in 2024 &#x2014; allowing the company to minimize export duties before reselling it at a higher price on international markets. Before Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Energoresurs exported coal to Bulgaria, Estonia, the Czech Republic, and Romania. Since then, almost all coal shipments have been redirected to Turkey. Between 2021 and 2023, the company reportedly generated $350,000 in revenue, though at a &quot;modest transfer price,&quot; according to the report.	https://kyivindependent.com/yanukovychs-son-made-billions-selling-coal-from-occupied-ukraine-to-turkey-report-says/	2025-02-04T04:33:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-470932149.jpg
Illegal maneuver' — Democratic lawmakers oppose merging USAID under State Department	Democratic lawmakers in the U.S. Congress on Feb. 3 protested the merging of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) under the State Department, warning that the decision threatens global aid programs, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported. U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio as acting administrator of USAID, according to a statement published on Feb. 3. The announcement came shortly after Trump&apos;s ally Elon Musk claimed that he had the president&apos;s support in shutting down the agency. Members of Congress gathered outside the USAID headquarters in Washington, condemning what they called an &quot;illegal maneuver&quot; by Tesla and SpaceX CEO Musk, who Trump has tasked with reducing the size of the federal government. The lawmakers also protested reports that USAID employees had been ordered not to report to work and were locked out of government email and accounts. The Congress members accused Musk of interfering in U.S. foreign aid programs while his companies, including SpaceX, continue to receive Pentagon contracts. &quot;Elon Musk is a terrible president,&quot; Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota and the running mate of the unsuccessful Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, posted on X, alluding to what some see as the billionaire&apos;s oversized influence in the new administration. USAID, the U.S. government&apos;s primary foreign aid agency, funds programs in global health, clean water access, energy security, and civil society. Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and over $30 billion in direct budget support to Kyiv. The administration&apos;s move has effectively frozen all foreign assistance for at least 90 days, halting USAID-funded projects worldwide while the administration carries out a review. On Feb. 3, the White House announced, &quot;Under President Trump, the waste, fraud, and abuse ends now,&quot; criticizing USAID for misusing taxpayer money on supposedly &quot;ridiculous&quot; projects. The &quot;waste and abuse programs&quot; list included nothing related to Ukraine. Ukraine&apos;s humanitarian and information policy parliamentary committee has begun consultations with European partners to temporarily replace U.S. funding.	https://kyivindependent.com/illegal-maneuver-democratic-lawmakers-oppose-trumps-plan-to-merge-usaid-into-state-department/	2025-02-04T03:44:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2197460670.jpg
EU allocates $258 million in energy support for Moldova, $62 million for Transnistria	The European Commission and Moldova signed a two-year strategy for energy independence and resilience, allocating 250 million euros ($258 million) to Chisinau in 2025, the commission said on Feb. 4. In addition to this overall support, 60 million euros ($62 million) are made available &#x2014; under conditions &#x2014; to Transnistria, a Russian-occupied region of Moldova facing energy shortages since Russia&apos;s Gazprom cut off gas supplies. The Russian energy giant halted the gas flow to Moldova in January, just as Ukraine halted the transit of Russian gas through its territory. Gazprom claimed its decision was based on an alleged unpaid debt by Chisinau rather than transit issues. The EU&apos;s support for Moldova, 100 million euros ($103 million) of which will be provided by mid-April, aims at &quot;decoupling Moldova from the insecurities of Russian energy supply and fully integrating it in the EU energy market,&quot; the commission&apos;s statement read. Moldova, currently leading talks on EU accession, has already pivoted toward European gas supplies but receives electricity from the Transnistria Kuciurgan power plant, which, in turn, is reliant on Russian gas. The EU&apos;s offer to Transnistria is subject to conditions that the local authorities take steps on &quot;fundamental freedoms and human rights&quot; and that the aid will not involve any &quot;energy intensive activities.&quot; As the first step of the strategy, the EU has already provided 30 million euros ($31 million) to Moldova that were announced on Jan. 27. The final step of the plan will entail investments in Moldova&apos;s energy resilience and independence, which will be included in the EU&apos;s Growth Plan for Moldova and implemented by 2026.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-allocates-258-million-in-energy-support-for-moldova-62-million-earmarked-for-transnistria/	2025-02-04T03:18:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-1258308410.jpg
Russia records 20,000 claims to declare people dead or missing last year, marking 2.5-fold surge, media reports	Russian courts received 20,000 claims in 2024 seeking to declare individuals missing or dead, marking a two-and-a-half increase from previous years, independent media outlet Mediazona reported on Feb. 4. Before the full-scale war, Russian courts handled approximately 8,000 such cases annually. The surge in filings, which began in mid-2024, represents the first significant rise in missing persons cases since Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The figures hint at mounting Russian losses during the full-scale invasion, which various estimates place between 600,000 and 840,000 killed and wounded. Moscow does not publish its official casualty figures. According to Mediazona, most of the claims last year were initiated by Russian military unit commanders who sought to remove missing soldiers &#x2014; presumed dead but lacking official confirmation &#x2014; from personnel rosters. This process allows units to recruit replacements. Families do not need to consent to these legal declarations, which often leaves them without financial support or clear information about their relatives&apos; fate, the outlet wrote. The exact number of missing Russian soldiers remains unknown, as courts routinely withhold applicants&apos; names and avoid publicizing rulings. In 2024, an estimated 12,000 additional cases were recorded beyond the usual peacetime figures. More than 50,000 inquiries have been submitted by Russians seeking information about missing soldiers through Ukraine&apos;s &quot;I Want to Find&quot; project, Bohdan Okhrimenko, head of the Coordination Center Secretariat, said on Jan. 3. Initially launched in September 2022 as part of the &quot;I Want to Live&quot; hotline, which helps Russian soldiers surrender, the project was expanded to address requests from families searching for missing troops. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Anna Tsivilyova disclosed on Nov. 26 that her ministry had received 48,000 DNA test applications from relatives hoping to locate missing soldiers. Speaking at a Duma roundtable, Tsivilyova revealed that the DNA data was stored in a database, inadvertently providing a rare glimpse into the scale of Russian casualties. Andrei Kartapolov, head of the State Duma&apos;s defense committee, cautioned against publicizing such figures. &quot;This is sensitive information. When we finalize the documents, we must ensure these figures do not appear publicly,&quot; he said. According to the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, Russia has lost 842,930 troops since launching its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-records-20000-missing-or-dead-claims/	2025-02-04T02:26:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1242120665.jpg
4 killed, 20 injured in Russian missile strike on Izium in Kharkiv Oblast	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A Russian missile attack against the town of Izium in Kharkiv Oblast on Feb. 4 killed at least four people and injured 20, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. At least five of the injured have been hospitalized. According to preliminary data, Russian forces used a ballistic missile in the attack, targeting the central part of the city, Syniehubov said. The full extent of damage and casualties is being determined. Izium, a town with a pre-invasion population of 45,000, lies in the southeastern part of Kharkiv Oblast, over 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the regional center, Kharkiv, and around 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of the front line. Kharkiv Oblast in Ukraine&apos;s northeast is a regular target of Russian missile and drone attacks from across the border or Russian-occupied territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-strikes-izium/	2025-02-04T02:06:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1746314205.jpeg
What to expect from Ukraine’s defense innovation in 2025	Despite the uncertainty surrounding a potential resolution to the war, Ukrainians know one thing for sure: we must ramp up our defense capabilities to effectively defend against current and future Russian aggression. This requires the rapid development of asymmetrical solutions to counter Russia&apos;s advantages in personnel, material, and financial resources. Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine underscored the importance of technological innovation in national defense. In fact, cutting-edge technology and ingenuity have been key to Ukraine&apos;s ability to resist and achieve victories against Russia. For example, the mass deployment of FPV drones was crucial in holding off Russian offenses during late 2023 and early 2024, when Ukraine faced severe ammunition shortages. In 2024, the Ukrainian military received more than 1 million drones &#x2014; what began as a largely volunteer initiative at the start of the war was significantly bolstered by the Ukrainian state. Ukraine continues to accelerate its efforts, with the government&apos;s Brave1 platform serving as a key birthplace for innovations. Brave1 is currently supporting over 1,500 Ukrainian tech companies with a total of $30 million in grants, in addition to providing comprehensive logistical, technical, and informational support. By engaging both domestic and foreign investors, we achieved an eightfold increase in investment in 2024 compared to 2023, reaching $40 million. These efforts have led to the development of several crucial technologies, such as interceptor drones capable of destroying Russian reconnaissance drones like the Orlan and Zala, significantly hindering Russia&apos;s precision strike capabilities. While these innovations are rapidly driven by the evolving battlefield situation, we can identify key strategic priorities for Ukraine in 2025 based on our experience as a leading government platform for accelerating defense tech innovation. Artificial intelligence is already widely used on the battlefield in Ukraine, with Brave1 supporting over 200 AI-driven innovations. Its applications range from analyzing photo and video data gathered by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on the battlefield through military intelligence systems like Griselda and Delta to AI-powered drones capable of hitting targets even under electronic warfare (EW) interference. The next step is moving beyond the &quot;one drone, one operator&quot; model to &quot;drone swarms&quot; &#x2014; autonomous, intelligent networks of multiple drones controlled by a single operator. &quot;Shahed&quot; suicide drones, originally an Iranian product, are now mass-produced and deployed by Russia daily, primarily targeting civilian infrastructure as a form of terrorist attack. Given their prevalence and devastating impact on the Ukrainian civilian population, Ukrainian innovators are likely to focus efforts on countering this threat. While aerial drones often dominate discussions, land-based technologies are also a priority for Brave1, with over 300 solutions examined and more than 40 codified according to NATO standards. These land drones can compensate for Ukraine&apos;s personnel shortages by performing tasks currently carried out by soldiers on the ground, including reconnaissance, supporting defensive and offensive operations, cargo delivery, casualty evacuation, and mine clearing/laying. Crucially, these technologies protect Ukrainian lives. We expect to see further advancements in both the number and functionality of land-based drones in 2025. A &quot;Zmii&quot; unmanned demining vehicle is showcased as part of a joint UNDP and Ukrainian Economy Ministry initiative at an unidentified location in May 2024. (UNDP in Ukraine)Domestic missile programIn 2024, Ukraine managed to bring the war to Russian territory, not only through the Kursk operation but also through a number of successful long-range drone strikes deep into Russian territory, targeting the aggressor&apos;s war infrastructure. In 2025, we expect more such strikes as Ukraine&apos;s domestic missile program rapidly develops. This area is particularly important as Ukraine has faced hesitation from partners in providing long-range weapons in the past. Electronic warfare (EW) is rapidly becoming a key defense tech area as the war increasingly revolves around drone warfare, with both Russian occupiers and Ukrainian defenders using drones daily. Currently, there are more than 140 Ukrainian EW manufacturers, with more than 30 solutions already codified according to NATO standards. While most current EW solutions are short-range, focused on simple white-noise jamming, ongoing work aims to develop more powerful, long-range solutions, as well as &quot;smarter&quot; EW capable of operating in challenging environments. This list is not exhaustive, and some developments may be announced after the fact for maximum impact. While uncertainty remains, one thing is clear: Ukraine has established itself as a global defense tech hub and will continue to innovate, surprising not only its enemies but the world as well.

Greenpeace urges IAEA to block Russia's Zaporizhzhia reactor restart as Grossi visits Kyiv	Greenpeace Ukraine has urged the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to prevent Russia from illegally restarting reactors at the occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), the organization said in a Feb. 4 press release. The appeal comes as IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi is visiting Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian officials before heading to Moscow to discuss the situation with Russian authorities. Russian forces have occupied the Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe&apos;s largest nuclear facility, since March 2022. The power station has been repeatedly disconnected from Ukraine&apos;s power grid due to Russian attacks on energy infrastructure, increasing the risk of a nuclear disaster. Greenpeace warned Grossi that Russian officials have recently expressed intentions to restart the reactors to generate electricity for Russia and solidify their control over the plant. In December 2024, Rosatom Director General Alexey Likhachev said restarting the plant&apos;s reactors was the Russian state nuclear company&apos;s &quot;dream.&quot; Sergey Kiriyenko, Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s first deputy chief of staff, similarly noted that Moscow intended to restart the reactors &quot;as fast as possible.&quot; Greenpeace stressed that there is no legal or safety justification for restarting any reactors at the plant under the current occupation. &quot;So long as Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant remains under illegal Russian occupation, there are no conditions that permit the restart of reactors,&quot; said Shaun Burnie, a nuclear specialist at Greenpeace Ukraine. &quot;If the Russian occupation is not ended, there is the very real prospect of the IAEA secretariat collaborating with Russia&apos;s plans for the restart.&quot; Grossi previously said that a restart is impossible under current wartime conditions but has reportedly discussed with Rosatom the possibility of preparing the plant for future operations when conditions allow.	https://kyivindependent.com/greenpeace-urges-iaea-to-block-russias-zaporizhzhia-reactor-restart-amid-grossis-kyiv-visit/	2025-02-04T01:48:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1673593890.jpg
Ukraine's Southern Operational Command chief steps down after being appointed NATO liaison	Brigadier General Hennadii Shapovalov, Ukraine&apos;s Southern Operational Command chief, announced his resignation on Feb. 4 after he was appointed to the NATO military aid coordination center in Germany. &quot;It was an honor to be the commander of the troops of the Southern Operational Command chief &#x2014; a powerful military team that has been courageously and selflessly defending the independence and sovereignty of Ukraine in all directions since the first days of the Russian-Ukrainian war,&quot; Shapovalov said in his statement. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced in mid-January Shapovalov&apos;s appointment to a new position coordinating military assistance to Ukraine in Wiesbaden, Germany. The city hosts NATO&apos;s Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU), a center established as part of key commitments at the allied summit in July 2024. Shapovalov is a graduate of the U.S. Army War College, which trains senior officers of the U.S. military. He previously commanded Ukraine&apos;s 59th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade and was promoted to brigadier general in 2022. The commander led the Southern Operational Command since April 2024 after replacing Andrii Kovalchuk amid broader military personnel changes.	https://kyivindependent.com/shapovalov-steps-down/	2025-02-04T01:27:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/437485241_750939180499660_6831791159206116970_n.jpg
Russian soldiers face execution threats to retake lost ground near Kupiansk, Ukraine claims	Russian commanders in the Kupiansk sector are ordering their soldiers to retake positions from which they retreated under Ukrainian fire, threatening them with execution if they refuse, Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces claimed on Feb. 4, citing intelligence reports. Ukrainian soldiers forced Russian troops to abandon forward positions near a settlement in the Kupiansk sector following intensive assaults, the unit said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Russian forces intensified their assault on Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast in September 2024, pushing toward the city&apos;s industrial outskirts in the northeast. Ukrainian forces repelled several attempts to enter the town throughout December. The estimated Russian advance in the Kupiansk district, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine, as of Feb. 4, 2025. A white symbol marks the city of Kupiansk. (DeepState / OpenStreetMaps)For months, Russia has sought to establish a foothold along the eastern bank of the Oskil River, attempting to outflank Ukrainian defenses and open the way for a rear attack on Kupiansk. The front line now lies just 2 kilometers (1.5 miles) from the town. President Volodymyr Zelensky recently appointed Major General Mykhailo Drapatyi, the commander of Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces, to lead the Khortytsia group as Ukraine works to counter Russian advances in the sector. Western and Ukrainian officials have pointed to poor morale among Russian troops since the outbreak of the full-scale war. Moscow employs the infamous &quot;human wave&quot; tactics in which its troops overwhelm Ukrainian defenders through sheer numbers despite suffering heavy losses. Reports of Russian commanders executing their soldiers have also surfaced amid some of the heaviest battles of the war, for example, during Russia&apos;s siege of the stronghold town of Avdiivka in late 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-commanders-execution-threats/	2025-02-04T00:47:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1239919502-1.jpg
2 killed, 13 injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks against multiple Ukrainian regions killed at least two civilians and injured at least 13 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 4. Russia launched 65 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Thirty-seven drones were shot down over five oblasts, while 28 others were lost in the airspace without causing any damage, according to the statement. Russian attacks in Donetsk Oblast killed one person in the town of Pokrovsk, injured one civilian in the village of Rubtsi, and another in the village of Bahatyr, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. A 71-year-old woman was injured during a Russian attack against the town of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast on Feb. 3, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. An ambulance was also damaged in a separate Russian attack against the town. In Kherson Oblast, Russian attacks killed one person and injured nine, said the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. A civilian was also injured during a Russian drone attack against the Seredyna-Buda community of Sumy Oblast, the regional military administration reported. Drone debris damaged an unfinished 18-story building and a clinic in the Pechersk district of Kyiv, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said. No casualties or fires were reported. Twelve Russian drones were shot down over Cherkasy Oblast, causing fires at three enterprises in Cherkasy but inflicting no casualties, Governor Ihor Taburets.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-124/	2025-02-04T00:25:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-04_09-55-28.jpg
Selfish' — Scholz blasts Trump's aid-for-rare earths Ukraine plan	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz criticized U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s proposal to tie military aid for Ukraine to access to the country&apos;s rare earth resources, calling it &quot;very selfish and self-centered,&quot; Spiegel reported on Feb. 4. Speaking after an informal meeting of European leaders in Brussels, Scholz reportedly stressed that Ukraine should first be helped to &quot;get back on its feet&quot; and that its resources should be used for reconstruction after the war. This comes as Trump told reporters on Feb. 3 that he was seeking a deal where Ukraine would &quot;secure what we&apos;re giving them with their rare earths and other things,&quot; though he did not specify which materials Washington is targeting. A source in the Presidential Office told the Kyiv Independent that sharing Ukrainian resources with allies is already part of President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s &quot;victory plan,&quot; which has been presented to foreign leaders, including Trump. Trump&apos;s remarks come amid uncertainty over the future of the U.S. aid to Ukraine. The U.S. has provided $65.9 billion in military aid to Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, with assistance remaining unaffected by the current aid freeze, Zelensky confirmed on Jan. 25. Non-military programs run by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) have lost funding under the new administration. USAID has provided Ukraine with $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and over $30 billion in direct budgetary support. In response to the funding cuts, Ukraine&apos;s parliamentary committee on humanitarian and information policy has begun consultations with European partners to temporarily replace U.S. funding. Under Scholz&apos;s leadership, Germany has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. However, the chancellor has resisted providing Taurus long-range cruise missiles, citing escalation concerns. Scholz has also blocked the proposed additional security assistance for Ukraine worth 3 billion ($3.09 billion) euros unless it is covered by additional government borrowing. The plan, backed by German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, included three additional Iris-T air defense batteries, 10 howitzers, and more artillery ammunition.	https://kyivindependent.com/selfish-scholz-slams-trumps-proposal-to-tie-ukraine-aid-to-rare-earth-access-spiegel-reports/	2025-02-03T23:29:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2147904710.jpg
Trump officially appoints Keith Kellogg as special envoy for Ukraine, Russia	U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 3 officially appointed retired General Keith Kellogg as a special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Voice of America correspondent Kateryna Lisunova reported. &quot;We made a lot of progress on Russia-Ukraine,&quot; Trump reportedly said after signing the decree without providing further details. Kellogg previously served as the executive secretary and the chief of staff of the U.S. National Security Council in the first Trump administration and was a top advisor to then-U.S. Vice President Mike Pence. He was scheduled to visit Ukraine in January after Trump&apos;s election and before the inauguration, but the trip was postponed for legal reasons. Kellogg has praised Trump&apos;s willingness to engage with Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling former U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s refusal to work with Putin a &quot;biggest mistake.&quot; Trump&apos;s envoy said he believes the new U.S. president can broker a satisfactory deal for both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Kellogg told Reuters on Feb. 1 that Ukraine&apos;s presidential and parliamentary elections, suspended since the full-scale war began, &quot;need to be done.&quot; He argued that holding elections during wartime would strengthen Ukraine&apos;s democracy. The Trump administration is debating whether to secure a temporary ceasefire before negotiating a permanent resolution, with the election winner potentially overseeing future talks with Moscow. Kellogg also suggested using frozen Russian assets to purchase American weapons for Ukraine, as reported by Fox News on Jan. 24. Zelensky recently emphasized the need to end the war diplomatically in 2025, suggesting that a Trump administration could accelerate the process. Kellogg defined the &quot;near term&quot; end to the war as 100 days out from the inauguration and said it was his personal and professional goal to help Trump broker a solution by that point.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-appoints-keith-kellogg-as-special-envoy-for-ukraine-russia/	2025-02-03T23:00:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1228656063.jpg
North Korean troops absent from front in Russia's Kursk Oblast since mid-January, Seoul says	North Korean troops have not been fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast since mid-January, the Yonhap news agency reported on Feb. 4, citing South Korea&apos;s intelligence agency. This comes as another confirmation that the originally 11,000-12,000-strong North Korean contingent dispatched to aid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine has been pulled back after suffering significant losses. Moscow&apos;s key ally Pyongyang sent the troops last fall to help Russian forces oust Ukrainian soldiers fighting in the Russian border region of Kursk since early August 2024. Kyiv hopes to leverage its positions there in potential negotiations. &quot;Since mid-January, there have been no signs showing North Korean troops deployed to the Russian Kursk region engaging in battle,&quot; South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) said, suggesting that heavy losses may have been one of the reasons for their withdrawal. Seoul previously said that 300 North Korean soldiers had been killed and 2,700 injured fighting in the war, while the Ukrainian military estimated that as many as half of the contingent had been killed or wounded. Experts interviewed by the Kyiv Independent connected North Korea&#x2019;s high casualty rates to a lack of experience with modern warfare, the &quot;human wave&quot; tactics employed against entrenched Ukrainian positions, and the resolve of North Korean troops to avoid capture, even at the cost of their own lives. At the same time, many Ukrainian military service members and observers described North Korean troops as highly motivated and presenting a significant challenge to Ukrainian soldiers. After The New York Times reported on Jan. 30 that North Korean troops had been pulled from the front, a Special Operations Forces spokesperson confirmed for the Kyiv Independent that Ukraine&apos;s special forces had not faced Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers for three weeks. &quot;These are standard measures &#x2013; rotation due to large casualties,&quot; a military intelligence source commented for the Kyiv Independent at the time, confirming the reports. Previous comments by Ukrainian officials suggest that North Korean troops may have been taken off the front lines only temporarily. The military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, said he expects Pyongyang to dispatch additional reinforcements to Russia, namely artillery units.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-absent-from-front-seoul-says/	2025-02-03T22:50:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-668705966.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 842,930 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 842,930 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 4. This number includes 1,270 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,938 tanks, 20,709 armored fighting vehicles, 35,921 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,655 artillery systems, 1,269 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,053 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 24,003 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-3/	2025-02-03T22:14:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/IMG_2727--1--2.jpg
Russia proposes easing conscription rules for people with certain mental disorders, syphilis, NGO reports	Russia&apos;s Ministry of Defense has proposed changes to military medical examination rules that would simplify the conscription of individuals with psychosis, hypertension, and syphilis. The amendments would also make it harder for soldiers to be discharged for health reasons during mobilization, according to a report by a Russian independent non-profit organization (Movement of Conscientious Objectors to military service in Russia). Currently, individuals diagnosed with primary, secondary, or latent syphilis are exempt from conscription under category &quot;B,&quot; meaning they are considered limitedly fit and not subject to the draft in peacetime. However, under the proposed amendments, they would instead be classified as fit for service with minor restrictions. Similar changes would apply to conscripts suffering from moderate, short-term endogenous psychoses and severe neurotic psychoses related to stress or mood disorders. These individuals, who were previously assigned category &quot;D&quot; (unfit for service), would now be deemed eligible with some restrictions. Additionally, the amendments remove an important provision that allowed for consideration of pre-existing illnesses that worsened after enlistment when determining a soldier&#x2019;s fitness. Under the new rules, such cases would no longer be formally recognized as a basis for discharge, further tightening restrictions on medical exemptions. According to an explanatory note, the Ministry of Defense developed these amendments to &quot;improve the system of medical examination of servicemen&quot; by incorporating lessons from the ongoing war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-proposes-easing-conscription-rules-for-people-with-certain-mental-disorders-syphilis-ngo-reports/	2025-02-03T21:47:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1247591136.jpg
Ukraine secures return of 12 children from Russian-occupied territories	Ukraine successfully brought back 12 children who had been forcibly taken to Russian-occupied territory, Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak announced late on Feb. 3. The effort was part of the Bring Kids Back UA initiative, a program under President Volodymyr Zelensky aimed at rescuing Ukrainian children deported by Russia. Yermak said the children who returned home include a 16-year-old girl who lost her mother, a 17-year-old who had been issued a summons to join the Russian army, and an eight-year-old girl. Since February 2022, at least 20,000 Ukrainian children have been abducted from Russian-occupied territories and sent to other Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine or to Russia itself, according to a Ukrainian national database, &quot;Children of War.&quot; The Ukrainian Parliament&#x2019;s Commissioner for Human Rights, Dmytro Lubinets, estimates that Russia has unlawfully deported up to 150,000 Ukrainian children, while the Children&#x2019;s Ombudswoman, Daria Herasymchuk, puts the figure at 200,000&#x2013;300,000. Ukraine considers these abductions a war crime and argues that they meet the U.N.&apos;s legal definition of genocide. Russia often claims it is relocating children to protect them from conflict zones. According to the Ministry of Reintegration, the government has managed to return 388 children so far. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Children&apos;s Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, citing their involvement in the unlawful transfer of Ukrainian children. Russia dismissed the ICC&apos;s decision as &quot;outrageous and unacceptable.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-secures-return-of-12-children-from-russian-occupied-territories/	2025-02-03T19:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/dscf6830-1668456828oat5c.jpg
Trump expected to withdraw US from UN Human Rights Council, Reuters reports	U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to announce on Feb. 4 that the United States will withdraw from the United Nations Human Rights Council and extend a freeze on funding for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, a White House official told Reuters. The move comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits Washington. Netanyahu has been a vocal critic of UNRWA, accusing the agency of inciting anti-Israel sentiment and alleging that some of its staff members have ties to terrorism. During his first term from 2017 to 2021, Trump also halted U.S. contributions to UNRWA, arguing that the agency required reforms and that funding should be contingent on Palestinian participation in peace talks with Israel. His administration withdrew from the 47-member Human Rights Council in 2018, citing what it described as a persistent bias against Israel and a failure to implement reforms. The U.S. later rejoined the council under President Joe Biden, serving a term from 2022 to 2024. The Human Rights Council is set to review the United States&apos; human rights record in August as part of its routine evaluation of all member states. While the council lacks legal authority, its discussions carry political significance and can generate international pressure for policy changes. Since returning to office for a second term on Jan. 20, Trump has also ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the World Health Organization and the Paris climate agreement, mirroring decisions made during his first administration. The U.S. was previously UNRWA&apos;s largest donor, contributing between $300 million and $400 million annually. However, in January 2024, Biden paused funding after Israel accused about a dozen UNRWA employees of involvement in the deadly Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which sparked the ongoing war in Gaza. In response, the U.S. Congress formally suspended contributions to the agency until at least March 2025. UNRWA provides essential aid, healthcare, and education services to millions of Palestinian refugees in Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-expected-to-withdraw-us-from-un-human-rights-council/	2025-02-03T18:12:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158937171.jpg
UK to provide more military aid to Ukraine this year than ever before, Starmer says	The United Kingdom will provide more military support to Ukraine in 2025 than it ever has before, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Feb. 3. The U.K. previously announced plans to deliver unprecedented military assistance to Ukraine this year, with 3 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) already committed for lethal aid. &quot;We must do all that we can to support Ukraine&apos;s defense,&quot; Starmer said at a joint press conference alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in Brussels. &quot;That means stabilizing the front line, providing the kit and training that they need, and that&apos;s why this year the UK will give more military support to Ukraine than ever before.&quot; Starmer&apos;s comments come weeks after the U.K. and Ukraine signed a historic 100-year partnership agreement in Kyiv. The wide-ranging deal encompasses cooperation in military, energy, scientific, cultural, economic, and other sectors. During the press conference, Starmer described the devastating effects of Russia&apos;s full-scale war that he encountered on his recent visit to Kyiv. &quot;I saw residential buildings destroyed just days before,&quot; he said. &quot;I met soldiers in the ICU recovering from really terrible burns. And I met children whose parents are out there now on the front line, and it&apos;s yet another reminder that this is a war not just in Ukraine, but a war on Ukraine, against those children and their future.&quot; Starmer said it was essential for Ukraine&apos;s allies, particularly its European partners, to step up to help Kyiv meet its defense needs. He also mentioned U.S President Donald Trump&apos;s recent threat of santions against Russia. &quot;It&apos;s clear that&apos;s got (Russian President Vladimir) Putin rattled,&quot; Starmer said. &quot;We know that he&apos;s worried about the state of the Russian economy. So I&apos;m here to work with our European partners on keeping up the pressure, targeting the energy revenues and the companies supplying his missile factories to crush Putin&apos;s war machine.&quot; The U.K. and other European countries have pledged to play a greater role in Ukraine&apos;s defense against Russia amid the transition in the U.S. government. Trump has already limited U.S. foreign aid to Ukraine and other countries, and it is unclear what the future holds for ongoing weapons shipments from Washington to Kyiv. Starmer has promised that the U.K. will play its &quot;full part&quot; in peacekeeping efforts in Ukraine, possibly including the deployment of British troops to monitor a ceasefire on the ground.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-to-provide-more-military-aid-to-ukraine-this-year-than-ever-before-starmer-says/	2025-02-03T16:29:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196935320.jpg
US briefly paused weapons to Kyiv in first days of Trump term, sources tell Reuters	The United States briefly stopped shipping weapons to Ukraine as the new White House administration debated its policies toward Kyiv, Reuters reported on Feb. 3, citing four sources familiar with the matter. U.S. President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20, upending U.S. foreign policy with freezes on international development funds and promises to swiftly end the war in Ukraine. The Trump administration was initially inclined to stop all aid to Ukraine, but arms deliveries resumed over the weekend following internal discussion, two of the sources told Reuters. Opposing factions within the administration are debating whether the U.S. should continue providing weapons, a U.S. official said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. Trump signed an executive order on the first day of his term freezing foreign aid funding for 90 days. The order disrupts NGOs doing vital infrastructure and humanitarian aid projects in Ukraine, but Ukrainian officials assured the freeze did not affect weapons deliveries. Trump told reporters on Feb. 3 that the U.S. is looking to strike a deal with Kyiv that would provide continued aid in exchange for Ukrainian rare earth elements. &quot;We&apos;re looking to do a deal with Ukraine, where they&apos;re going to secure what we&apos;re giving them with their rare earths and other things,&quot; he said. The New York Times reported in December that Ukrainian authorities postponed signing an agreement with the U.S. on extracting rare earth minerals in order to let Trump take credit for the deal after his inauguration. President Volodymyr Zelensky has urged the U.S. to continue shipping arms to Ukraine as a security guarantee that would strengthen Kyiv&apos;s position in future peace negotiations with Russia. The U.S. has provided Ukraine with $65.9 billion in military aid since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-briefly-paused-weapons-to-kyiv-in-first-days-of-trump-term-sources-tell-reuters/	2025-02-03T14:42:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/--------------2024-03-19-202210.png
We need the corps system' — Zelensky approves plan to restructure army	Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces are transitioning to a new organizational structure intended to modernize the army, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 3. The announcement comes after Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said that reforming the army&apos;s structure and shifting to a corps-based system was among the military&apos;s key priorities. &quot;A plan has already been approved to transition to a new organizational structure of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said. According to Zelensky, the government and the military are now focused on implementing the restructure plan with an eye toward modernizing Ukrainian forces. &quot;We need the corps system,&quot; the president said. &quot;Today we discussed approaches to the appointment of corps commanders: these should be the best-trained, most promising officers with combat experience and modern thinking. The army must be modern.&quot; The relevant decisions regarding the organizational restructure will be made public, Zelensky said. Syrskyi reported earlier on Feb. 3 that the organizational reforms were already &quot;in progress&quot; and would help strengthen the Armed Forces even as they face difficulties on the battlefield. Russian forces significantly outnumber Ukrainian units in some parts of the front and have been able to gain territory in eastern Ukraine while absorbing heavy losses. Ukraine also faces on ongoing mobilization struggle, scandals over personnel transfers and mismanaged brigades, and uncertainty over the future of U.S. military aid.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-need-the-corps-system-zelensky-approves-plan-to-restructure-army/	2025-02-03T13:50:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196064752.jpg
Rubio takes control of USAID amid Musk's threats to shut down agency	U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio as acting adminstrator over the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), according to a statement published Feb. 3. The announcement comes shortly after billionaire Elon Musk claimed that he had Trump&apos;s approval to shut down the agency. &#xA0; Trump has named Rubio acting administrator &quot;as an interim step toward gaining control and better understanding over the agency&apos;s activity,&quot; the state department said in a press release. USAID has &quot;long strayed from its original mission of responsibly advancing American interests abroad,&quot; the statement read. &quot;As we evaluate USAID and ensure it is in alignment with an America First agenda and the efforts of the State Department, we will continue to protect the American people&apos;s interests and ensure their tax dollars are not wasted.&quot; Rubio told reporters in El Salvador that he would delegate day-to-day oversight of the agency to an official who has not yet been named. USAID, the U.S. government&apos;s lead humanitarian aid agency, funds initiatives ranging from women&apos;s health in conflict zones and clean water access to HIV/AIDS treatment, energy security, and civil society. During Trump&apos;s first days in office, the administration announced a 90-day freeze on all foreign assistance, effectively halting USAID&apos;s programming and threatening vital development projects worldwide. Musk, head of the Department of Government Effectiveness (DOGE) and world&apos;s richest man, has called USAID &quot;a criminal organization.&quot; He claimed on Feb. 3 that Trump &quot;agreed that we should shut (the agency) down.&quot; USAID staff were instructed to stay away from the agency&apos;s Washington headquarters and over 600 employees were locked out of the computer network, the Associated Press reported. Democratic lawmakers have assembled outside USAID headquarters to protest Trump&apos;s attacks on the agency. Senator Chris Van Hollen said the takeover of the agency constituted an &quot;illegal power grab&quot; and &quot;a corrupt abuse of power.&quot;Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and over $30 billion in direct budget support to Ukraine. This funding has helped rebuild schools, finance bomb shelters, and equip hospitals with advanced medical equipment.	https://kyivindependent.com/rubio-takes-control-of-usaid-amid-musks-threats-to-shut-down-agency/	2025-02-03T13:01:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194528244.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Kursk operation, long-range strikes into Russia — Syrskyi outlines Ukraine's priorities	Key developments on Feb. 3: Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi on Feb. 3 named Ukraine&apos;s operation in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast and strikes against military facilities deep inside Russian territory as Kyiv&apos;s key battlefield priorities. &quot;We continue effectively destroying Russia&apos;s military facilities to reduce its strike potential. We are destroying Russian forces both in Ukraine and Russia,&quot; Syrskyi wrote on social media. The commander outlined Ukraine&apos;s key priorities, including holding defensive lines, preventing Russian advances, and enhancing the use of unmanned systems. &quot;On the ground, first of all, we saturate units holding the defenses at the front line with personnel and equipment,&quot; Syrskyi said. He stressed the need to improve recruitment and psychological support for soldiers and better integrate newcomers from training centers before they undertake combat missions. Ukraine has intensified its long-range drone strikes on Russian oil facilities in the past weeks, aiming to disrupt fuel supplies to the Russian military and weaken Moscow&apos;s energy export revenues. Oil profits remain a key source of funding for Russia&apos;s war effort. In Kursk Oblast, Ukrainian forces have been holding positions since the start of the cross-border incursion in August 2024, reportedly seizing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukraine has since then lost roughly half of the captured area, fighting continues as Kyiv seeks to leverage its presence in Kursk Oblast in potential negotiations. U.S. President Donald Trump is seeking to have Ukraine supply the U.S. with rare earths as a condition for aid for the war-torn country. &quot;We&apos;re looking to do a deal with Ukraine, where they&apos;re going to secure what we&apos;re giving them with their rare earths and other things,&quot; Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Feb. 3. &quot;I want to have security of rare earths. We&apos;re putting in hundreds of billions of dollars. They have great rare earths. And I want security of the rare earths, and they&apos;re willing to do it,&quot; he added. Trump did not specify what kind of materials Washington is seeking from Kyiv. A source in the President&apos;s Office familiar with the matter told the Kyiv Independent that sharing Ukrainian resources with allies was part of President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s &quot;victory plan&quot; shown to foreign leaders, including Trump. &quot;But for this, (Ukrainian) security must be guaranteed so that the Russians do not occupy this Ukrainian land with minerals,&quot; the source told the Kyiv Independent. Trump&apos;s remarks come amid uncertainty over the future of the U.S. aid to Ukraine. Ukraine is already using laser technologies to hit Russian targets, Colonel Vadym Sukharevskyi, commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces, said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty published on Feb. 3. &quot;Laser technologies are already hitting certain objects at a certain altitude,&quot; Sukharevskyi said. The commander first said in mid-December 2024 that Ukraine is among the few nations with laser weapon capabilities. According to Sukharevskyi, Ukraine&#x2019;s laser system, called Tryzub, can down aircraft at altitudes exceeding 2 kilometers. The Unmanned Systems Forces, established less than a year ago, already include combat and research units operating across air, land, and sea. When asked how successful the development of these technologies has been, Sukharevskyi said that the Ukrainian military&apos;s R&amp;D (Research and Development) &quot;involves a number of areas.&quot; The new system was the result of efforts to find an effective countermeasure against Russian aircraft and drones, specifically Shahed-type attack drones, he added. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify these claims. Ukraine&apos;s defense industry has gained momentum since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. In late January, the Unmanned Systems Forces said that Ukraine deployed a long-range drone capable of traveling up to 2,000 kilometers (1,242 miles) and carrying a 250-kilogram air bomb. U.S. military aid to Ukraine was delayed not only by opposition from congressional Republicans but also by concerns within President Joe Biden&apos;s administration about escalating the conflict with Russia, Reuters said in its analysis published on Feb. 3. Further complicating deliveries was a chaotic weapons-tracking system in which different branches of the U.S. military reportedly used varying definitions of &quot;delivered,&quot; creating confusion over how much aid reached Ukraine. The most significant delays nevertheless stemmed from months of congressional gridlock in later 2023 and early 2024 over approving $60 billion in additional military assistance, mainly due to Republican resistance, the news agency wrote. Democratic and Republican lawmakers had urged House Speaker Mike Johnson for months to bring the aid package to a vote. Hard-line Republicans aligned with President Donald Trump reportedly pressured Johnson to block further assistance to Kyiv. Even after Congress approved the funding, U.S. military aid to Ukraine remained inconsistent, Reuters reported, citing sources in Washington and Kyiv. By November 2024, Ukraine had received only half of the military aid the U.S. had promised for that year from existing Pentagon stockpiles. According to the analysis, only 30% of the pledged armored vehicles had been delivered by early December. The U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine is alarmed over a sharp rise in executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) by Russian forces, according to a press release obtained by the Kyiv Independent on Feb. 3. A total of 79 such executions in 24 separate incidents have been recorded by the mission since the end of August 2024. Presumably, some of these incidents concern group executions. Ukrainian authorities have documented widespread violations of the Geneva Conventions by Russia during the war. Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said in an interview with Ukrainska Pravda that as of mid-December 2024, Kyiv had recorded the execution of 177 captured Ukrainian soldiers, with 109 of them last year. The U.N. mission interviewed witnesses and analyzed videos and photos published by Ukrainian and Russian sources showing killings or dead bodies of Ukrainian POWs. The mission also said it had documented the execution of an injured and incapacitated &#x2014; but not yet captured &#x2014; Russian soldier by the Ukrainian army in 2024. Kyiv has not commented on this report. Many Ukrainian soldiers who surrendered or were in the custody of the Russian forces were shot dead on the spot, according to the statement. Unarmed and wounded Ukrainian soldiers were also killed, witnesses said. The reported executions took place in areas where Russian offensive operations were ongoing. According to Danielle Bell, the head of the mission, Russian public figures have explicitly called for the inhumane treatment and execution of captured Ukrainian soldiers, with at least three such appeals recorded by the mission along with social media posts made by Russian military-linked groups. &quot;These incidents did not occur in a vacuum,&quot; Bell said. &quot;All allegations of execution of captured Ukrainian military personnel and public statements calling for, or condoning, such actions must be investigated.&quot; The statement that &quot;no quarter&quot; will be given is a serious violation of international humanitarian law and a war crime, according to the statement.

Unmanned Systems Forces have carried out over 220 operations deep into Russia since its establishment, commander says	Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces (USF) have conducted over 220 operations deep inside Russian territory in the six months since its creation, Colonel Vadym Sukharevskyi, commander of the USF, said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty published on Feb. 3. Throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, both Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing warfare tactics. &quot;Our units have conducted over 220 operations to engage the enemy on Russian territory. More than 3,500 weapons have been launched so far,&quot; Sukharevskyi said. Ukrainian bomber drones and the units that use them are &quot;extremely efficient,&quot; Sukharevskyi said. Ukrainian bomber drones have recently hit targets over 50 kilometers (31 miles) deep inside Russia, the commander added. Work is also underway to systematize various types of software systems, develop tactics, and use ground robotic systems, according to Sukharevskyi. &quot;We have already begun the process of synchronizing and developing the components of activities at sea regarding defense and attack. And I think we will move on to the practical part very soon,&quot; he said. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and are frequently used by Ukrainian troops for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks. The USF said on Jan. 31 that Ukrainian soldiers are now using a long-range drone capable of traveling up to 2,000 kilometers (1,242 miles) and carrying a 250-kilogram air bomb. Ukraine also produced more than 30,000 bomber drones in 2024, according to Ukraine&apos;s Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin.	https://kyivindependent.com/unmanned-systems-forces-have-carried-out-over-220-operations-deep-into-russia-since-its-establishment-commander-says/	2025-02-03T12:25:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/MNM_2864.jpg
Ukrainian citizen beaten to death in Bratislava, media reports	A homeless Ukrainian citizen was beaten to death in Bratislava, Slovakia, the Slovak media outlet Aktuality reported on Feb. 3. The Ukrainian man was found on Jan. 30 in front of the Nivy shopping center in Bratislava with serious injuries to his head and body. He was hospitalized but died the next day due to the severity of his injuries. The man was previously caught stealing from the New Yorker clothing store in Nivy. Later, he was taken to a back room of the shopping center, as seen on the surveillance cameras. Slovak police are investigating several versions of the circumstances surrounding the death of a Ukrainian national, according to Aktuality. Local law enforcement agencies have not ruled out the possibility that the man was beaten by police and private security guards.

We cannot exclude ethnic hatred as one of the reasons for this crime,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote on X. &quot;We demand an impartial investigation and accountability,&quot; Sybiha added. The death of the Ukrainian citizen comes amid increased tensions between Kyiv and Bratislava. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, a long-time opponent of military aid to Ukraine, has escalated threats against Kyiv following the termination of Russian gas transit via Ukrainian territory on Jan. 1. Fico&apos;s Kremlin-friendly policies sparked widespread demonstrations throughout Slovakia, which his government has blamed on an alleged Ukrainian-backed coup. Fico has not provided evidence to support the allegations.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-citizen-beaten-to-death-in-bratislava-media-reports/	2025-02-03T12:24:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Bratislava_m-_stanicu-_ktor-_sa_vyrovn-_eur-pskym_metropol-m__Nazrite_do_Nivy_centra_-51536059094-.jpg
From drone simulators to civics: Ukraine reforms school curriculum to protect next generation from Russian threat	In a small town in Kyiv Oblast, 10th grader Alina Marynenko just beat her entire class to be the most accurate shooter on an AK-47 simulator. &quot;Fourteen out of fifteen! I set a record! We beat the boys!&quot; Marynenko yells out to her class. Marynenko and her classmates fired the simulated weapon during a &#x201C;Defense of Ukraine&#x201D; lesson, an experimental course part of a wider educational reform passed after the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. The course has been part of the Ukrainian school curriculum since Soviet times, also known over the years as &quot;Pre-Conscription Training&quot; and &quot;Defense of the Homeland.&quot; If before 2022, the subject was seen as obsolete, hardly taken seriously by students who at times saw it more as an opportunity to goof off, Russia&#x2019;s all-out aggression has given it a new life. &#xA0; Volodymyr Komlyk, a reserve officer in the Ukrainian Armed Forces and teacher of the &#x201C;Defense of Ukraine&#x201D; in Kyiv Oblast, on Oct. 1, 2024. (Lisa Bukreyeva / The Kyiv Independent)The reform, launched in 2024, has outfitted nearly 600 classrooms at schools that have volunteered to participate in the trial phase with new equipment from first aid training kits, interactive whiteboards and computers, to drone simulators. The new program will be mandatory across all schools in 2027. The authors of the reform and its proponents are quick to distinguish the &#x201C;Defense of Ukraine&#x201D; from its counterpart in Russia, where a similar mandatory school program returned basic military training to the curriculum after the start of the full-scale invasion. To distance itself from what many consider to be Russia&#x2019;s attempts at militarizing its youth, the new course in Ukraine includes topics such as civics, geopolitics, and history, in addition to weapons training on simulators. &quot;Every citizen has levers to influence certain processes in our society, the military, the state in general &#x2014; everywhere. And the skills the children acquire (in these classes) can be used in civilian life as well,&quot; Volodymyr Komlyk, a reserve officer in the Ukrainian Armed Forces and teacher of the &#x201C;Defense of Ukraine&#x201D; course in Kyiv Oblast course. &quot;Ukraine needs to be defended not only in the trenches.&quot; In Soviet times up until the reform, the course was divided by gender. While boys trained for potential military service, girls learned first aid and the basics of medicine. Before entering the classroom, boys would have to line up to greet the course teacher with a salute or listen to the national anthem. In a different classroom, girls dealt with old rubber tourniquets and bandages. Impractical, and at times unscientific, the knowledge the girls learned would hardly save anyone on the front line today. Various activities during a &#x201C;Defense of Ukraine&#x201D; lesson in Kyiv Oblast, on Oct. 1, 2024. (Lisa Bukreyeva / The Kyiv Independent)Textbooks were often full of outdated information. The classes were frequently taught by P.E., biology, or humanities teachers who at times had to rely on their own experience in teaching the subject. &quot;When I was at school, the teacher would come to class, open a page in a course book, and then his phone would ring. He worked as a taxi driver, and occasionally, he would get called in. We would sit alone and read from our textbook,&quot; Komlyk told the Kyiv Independent. The overall attitude toward the class meant it was often skipped by students, lawmaker Inna Sovsun, one of the authors of the reform, told the Kyiv Independent. The issue was both a lack of trained teachers and the Soviet curriculum, she said. School children during a &#x201C;Defense of Ukraine&#x201D; lesson in Kyiv Oblast, on Oct. 1, 2024. (Lisa Bukreyeva / The Kyiv Independent)Sovsun said the main goal of the change was to remove everything related to outdated Soviet army regulations from the course materials. It also did away with separating the students by gender. The move didn&#x2019;t sit well with opponents who felt girls shouldn&#x2019;t be learning military basics, Sovsun said. &quot;During work with focus groups, one of the teachers made the point that girls should not be taught to shoot because they do not have enough strength in their fingers to pull the trigger,&quot; Sovsun said. Besides merging girls&apos; and boys&apos; classes, the program also added introductory sections on drones, as well as updated units on marksmanship training, terrain orienteering, crisis response, and the basics of national security and defense of Ukraine, among other topics.

(Lisa Bukreyeva / The Kyiv Independent)The program&#x2019;s backers maintain they are not aiming to train 16 and 17-year-olds to be soldiers, but preparing them for a reality where Russian aggression is ongoing, with no clear end in sight. &quot;Can you imagine how many weapons are now in the hands of the military who will be returning home, where children live?&#x201D; Sovsun said, in reference to the importance of knowing how to properly handle weapons. &quot;I am also a mom. I don&apos;t want to prepare my children for military service, but it&#x2019;s my goal as a mother to make sure they know how to protect themselves so that Russia can&#x2019;t invade again in the future, and this knowledge isn&#x2019;t even needed.&#x201D; As the bell rings, the children head downstairs to a classroom that also serves as a shelter &#x2014; instead of desks, chairs are strewn across the room, which has been divided up into different zones for group activities and drone and shooting simulators. Komlyk works with 350 children from the 10th and 11th grades. Lessons are scheduled over 12 days a month, and children spend the entire school day at the location. Komlyk&apos;s school hosts its students and those from nearby smaller settlements. The name of the town where the school is located is not being disclosed for security reasons. &quot;We have merged some classes so that no more than 24 pupils are in each. Unfortunately, many children do not make it to class because of air raid alerts,&quot; Komlyk said.

(Lisa Bukreyeva / The Kyiv Independent)On this particular day, there were no air raid alerts, so the class was full as the students played a game to learn about the principles of how economies and states develop while others trained on simulators. &quot;You need to be very careful when flying. The drone is very sensitive. I wouldn&apos;t say that it&apos;s much harder to operate this controller. I think it&apos;s more a matter of the drone itself. It&apos;s very fast,&quot; said student Oleksandr Miestiechkin, as he tried to keep the FPV (first-person-view) drone in the air. The simulator is not like the one used in real military training. The only goal is to overcome neon-colored obstacles. The same goes for the shooting simulator: children use toy weapons without ammunition to shoot at moving or stationary targets, and a computer records the results. &quot;I asked the children why we needed this subject in the first lesson. Many of them answered, &apos;For going to the trench at 18,&#x2019;&quot; Komlyk said. &quot;I explained that Ukraine needs to be defended not only at the front line. It can be done in the public, political, media, or cultural sectors. The statements voiced by the children are a consequence of the old approach to teaching this subject,&quot; the teacher added. Student Arianna Safronova said one of her favorite activities is the game &quot;Two Countries,&quot; which aims to give children a basic understanding of what factors lead to the prosperity or collapse of a state. Schoolchildren practice with guns and eat apples during a &quot;Defense of Ukraine&quot; lesson in Kyiv Oblast, on Oct. 1, 2024. (Lisa Bukreyeva / The Kyiv Independent)&quot;We are now learning what a community is, its value and importance, and who we are,&quot; Safronova said, but added that she considers first aid to be the most important block of the course as Russia&#x2019;s war continues. Meanwhile, in 2024, the Russian state introduced a mandatory discipline for middle and high school called the &quot;Fundamentals of Security and Defense of the Motherland.&#x201D; The new course replaced the course &quot;Fundamentals of Life Safety&quot; (FLS), returning basic military training to the curriculum. For about 60 years, Soviet schoolchildren assembled and disassembled assault rifles, learned how to put on gas masks, and provided first aid during the lessons of &quot;Basic Military Training&quot; (BMT). This subject was removed from the school curriculum in the late 1980s and replaced with FLS. Discussions on its return were raised at the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Sergei Mironov, leader of the Just Russia &#x2014; For Truth party, said in 2022 that the resumption of BMT would help &quot;systematically prepare citizens for a possible confrontation with the enemy.&quot; The course is also intended to teach high school students how to use weapons and help employ war veterans who fought in Ukraine, according to Mironov. The topics for the revised course were developed in cooperation with the Russian Defense Ministry, with reserve lieutenant colonel Yuriy Kostikin from the Moscow Suvorov School leading the reform, according to the pro-Kremlin newspaper Lenta. As early as the first lesson, children should be taught how the Russian army was formed and that &quot;military service is the duty and obligation of every man,&#x201D; Kostikin said. Teenagers will learn about the principle of unity of command in the military and must internalize that &quot;the commander is always right,&quot; he said. The children will also go on several-day camps to practice their newly acquired skills in a hands-on environment, learning how to dig trenches, navigate the terrain, and survive in adverse conditions. The program in Russia requires children to memorize military regulations, as well as to obey the commands of &quot;Attention&quot; and &quot;Stand at ease.&quot; The updated course is mandatory only for boys, while girls can opt to study medicine. While Russia only made this subject compulsory in 2024, many Russian children have already been learning these skills in other forms, according to Jade McGlynn, a Leverhulme EC Researcher in the War Studies department at King&apos;s College London. Military and patriotic clubs, as well as ideological movements for youth, are widespread in Russia. The most well-known is the Young Army Cadets National Movement (&quot;Young Army&quot;), which is subordinated to Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry. Established in 2016, the &quot;Young Army &quot; is now sanctioned by the European Union, the U.S., Canada, and Switzerland due to its militarization of children. McGlynn noted that Russia is making significant efforts to militarize younger generation of Russians, as they are quite vulnerable and easily influenced by different views in their age.

The event, organized by local authorities, coincides with the second anniversary of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. (Contributor / Getty Images)Whether students are even interested in military training is no matter, McGlynn says, as the Russian state goes to length to ensure the interest emerges. &quot;The more you know about something, the more likely you&apos;ll become interested in it,&quot; she said. Russia has aimed its efforts to militarize young people in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine as well. Russia&#x2019;s proxies there have launched cadet classes, held events such as &quot;Vacations with the Russian Guard,&quot; and openly demonize Ukraine and the government in Kyiv. &quot;All (Ukrainian) children in occupation who&apos;ve lived through the war are going to be effectively militarized anyway just by having to grow up in such a horror,&quot; McGlynn said. &quot;This is not just about training children for war, in Russia&apos;s case. There is a deeply ideological, genocidal element of destroying their Ukrainian identity as well.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s very hard to destroy a person&apos;s identity. But the sort of pressure that Ukrainian children are placed under during the formative period of their self-realization means that, unfortunately, there is a strong possibility that Russia&#x2019;s efforts could be effective.&quot; Russian teenagers take part in a ceremony to join the patriotic Youth Army cadet movement in the main hall of the Stalingrad Battle Museum in Volgograd, Russia, on Jan. 25, 2023.

(Contributor / Getty Images)According to the Ukrainian government&apos;s official database, over 20,000 Ukrainian children have been displaced to Russian-occupied territories or Russia since the full-scale invasion. Ukraine&apos;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets has suggested that this number could be much bigger &#x2014; nearly 150,000. The Ukrainian government, which has recognized the deportation of children as genocide against the Ukrainian people, continues to work to bring them home. Yet, an equally great challenge is to protect Ukrainian youth on Ukraine-controlled territories from Russian influence, which could pose an even more significant threat in the future. &quot;We will never completely eradicate the Russian influence. It will always follow us somewhere on social media or while traveling worldwide,&quot; said Arianna Safronova, the Ukrainian 10th grader. &quot;Every citizen must realize that they are Ukrainians. Ukrainian culture exists, and our heritage is very powerful, just like our country.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/from-drone-simulators-to-civics-ukrainian-reforms-school-curriculum-to-protect-next-generation-from-russian-threat/	2025-02-03T12:04:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/--------------------------------------------_-------------------_----------2024.JPG
Ukraine announces privatization auction of country’s largest electromagnetic switch manufacturer	Ukraine&#x2019;s State Property Fund announced an auction to privatize the state-owned Radiorele plant in Kharkiv &#x2014; the country&#x2019;s largest switching equipment manufacturer, the fund said on Feb. 3. Kyiv has looked to privatize its long list of state-owned assets as a way to shore up its wartime budget. State-run assets are known to be a drain on the state&#x2019;s resources and have at times been feeding grounds for corruption. &#xA0; Ukraine&#x2019;s government included Hr 3.2 billion ($76 million) in privatization proceeds in the 2025 budget, which envisions auctioning off both small and large-scale assets. Radiorele produces low-current, miniature, electromagnetic switches, and relays, which are used to control voltage, current, and temperature in electrical systems. The plant has been put up for auction in the past, but has so far been unable to attract a buyer. The auction, which is for a 100% stake in the plant, will be held on Feb. 4. Its starting price is Hr 234.4 million ($5.6 million), which includes debts for the last six months. As of Sept. 30, 2024, the enterprise&#x2019;s debt was Hr 2.4 million ($57,339), including wage arrears of Hr 755,000 ($17,933) and arrears to Ukraine&#x2019;s budget of Hr 697,000 ($16,555). The new owner must commit to keeping all 66 of the firm&apos;s associates employed for the next six months, the fund said. Ukraine privatized several high-profile state-owned assets at the end of last year, including the iconic Hotel Ukraina located in downtown Kyiv and the titanium producer giant UMCC-Titanium. Businessman Maksym Krippa purchased Hotel Ukraina on Sept. 18 for $60 million. UMCC-Titanium was sold to Cremin Ukraine on Oct. 9 for $96 million. Despite a couple of recent big ticket privatization sales, the country&apos;s efforts to offload its assets has been slow to take over the years. Announced auctions have failed due to the absence of bidders. After Kirppa&apos;s company Ola Fine paid for Hotel Ukraina, the fund&apos;s revenue plan for 2024 through privatizations exceeded its goal for 2024 for the first time in many years.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-wants-to-privatize-countrys-largest-electromagnetic-switch-manufacturer/	2025-02-03T11:37:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1238672587.jpg

Ukrainian bakery Lviv Croissants opens first French location in Cannes	Ukrainian cafe chain Lviv Croissants opened its first restaurant in Cannes, France, making it the fifth country outside of Ukraine where it now operates, the company said in a press release on Feb. 3. Founded in Lviv in 2015, the chain has since grown to over 196 locations across Ukraine, Poland, Slovakia, the U.S., and now, France. The franchise is known for its croissants stuffed with both sweet and savory fillings. Lviv Croissants said it chose Cannes as its first French location &#x201C;because of the impressive tourist flow and high prospects for the gastronomic business.&#x201D; The 70-square-meter restaurant is located in the center of Cannes, in the bustling shopping district of Rue d&apos;Antibes. The new location seats 13 people inside and 24 outside on the terrace during the warmer months. The company spent six months researching the local market and food preferences before opening the new location. Locally-based chefs were hired to create croissant fillings that will only be served in France. The French menu includes more than 35 options, such as a goat cheese, honey, and nut croissant, a mortadella, pear, and gorgonzola croissant, and another with raclette cheese and cured ham. &#x201C;Everything else has remained the same: the traditional Lviv atmosphere, delicious quality coffee, and high standards of service. This is what visitors all over the world know and love us for,&#x201D; the company said in its press release. The chain said it is planning to open more locations in France, as well as launch a delivery service.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-bakery-lviv-croissants-opens-first-french-location-in-cannes/	2025-02-03T10:52:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/475906225_18441142147077863_1549274476716618369_n.jpg
‘We are where we're needed:’ The local entrepreneurs, businesses who stay in front-line Donetsk Oblast	DRUZHKIVKA, Donetsk Oblast &#x2014; A loud explosion goes off, followed by a second. People begin to run in different directions. Despite the chaos, taxi driver Serhiy Pohrebnyakov sits calmly behind the wheel, waiting for customers. Pohrebnyakov&#x2019;s wife and daughter fled Druzhkivka after the start of the full-scale invasion, leaving him alone in the town. Amid near-daily Russian attacks, Pohrebnyakov goes out on his route every day to make money to help his family, he says. &#x201C;I work to earn money for my family, who are now in Germany,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;They don&apos;t send me money here, I send money to them. I also look after our home here because who knows what will happen next.&#x201D; &#x201C;When my daughter calls me and says, &#x2018;Dad, I love you,&#x2019; it gives me the strength to get up in the morning and drive,&#x201D; he tells the Kyiv Independent. Druzhkivka is located a mere 15 kilometers (9 miles) from one of the hottest spots on the front line, the embattled town of Chasiv Yar. As Russia advances in the east, it has come under increased shelling and aerial attacks by Russian forces, the head of the Druzhkivka military administration says. A local resident goes to the water pump room to get some water in Druzhkivka, Ukraine on Dec. 18, 2024. (Yelyzaveta Sekretarenko / The Kyiv Independent)This is not the first time Druzhkivka has been threatened by a Russian invasion. It was occupied once before in 2014 when Russian-backed proxies took control of the town for nearly four months before being liberated by Ukraine. As Russia pushes westward toward the town, an uptick in attacks is damaging homes, businesses, and administrative buildings, much of which was rebuilt and developed over the past decade. Around 36,000 people &#x2014; half of Druzhkivka&#x2019;s wartime population &#x2014; have remained in the town. It has also become the new home of around 14,000 internally displaced people, and a hub for soldiers in the rear of the front lines. Those who have stayed, running businesses and organizations, keeping shops open and community centers alive, are vital to maintaining a semblance of normal life amid the devastation, as well as providing goods and services for soldiers in the area. &#xA0; Halyna Khomchenko watches children run around on a colorful playground from the second floor of a school in Druzhkivka. She is an entrepreneur and community activist who decided to stay in Druzhkivka to continue helping the locals. &#x201C;We are where we are needed,&#x201D; she tells the Kyiv Independent. Khomchenko opened the Child Development and Assistance Center in 2023 after the outbreak of the full-scale war. The center has around 50 students from pre-school-aged children to fourth graders. Despite its proximity to the front line and frequent Russian shelling, the center has all the qualities of a normal school life: textbooks are laid out on the desks, math and history lessons are in progress, and kids play during recess.

(Yelyzaveta Sekretarenko / The Kyiv Independent)Schoolchildren look at their drawings during a break between lessons in Druzhkivka, Ukraine on Dec. 16, 2024. (Yelyzaveta Sekretarenko / The Kyiv Independent)The outbreak of the full-scale invasion in February 2022 forced all schools in Druzhkivka to switch to online learning. Since then, Khomchenko&#x2019;s center has been the only place where students can study in person. &#x201C;We saw that after what they had experienced, children not only need knowledge but also emotional support. The center has become a place where they feel safe, learn, and recover from their traumas,&#x201D; says Khomchenko. Before the full-scale invasion, she ran a rehabilitation center for families who had adopted children in the neighboring village of Shchurove. Russian troops destroyed the rehab center when they occupied the village in May 2022. &#x201C;That wasn&#x2019;t the only place of my strength that was destroyed by the Russians,&#x201D; says Khomchenko. When Druzhkivka came under heavy attacks in early 2022, Russia hit Khomchenko&apos;s family&apos;s bakery, Khoma Khlib &#x2014; or Thomas Bread, in English. At the time, bread had already largely disappeared from the town&#x2019;s shelves due to shortages at the start of the invasion. It took Khomchenko several weeks to reopen their bakery in a new location. &#x201C;We worked around the clock so that people didn&#x2019;t have to worry about the lack of bread, so that the panic would disappear,&#x201D; Khomchenko recalls. Her bakery sold bread at a symbolic price of Hr 10 ($0.24) or distributed it free of charge to those who could not pay. Food is now readily available in the town, and shelves are stocked with bread, including Khomchenko&#x2019;s, as Druzhkivka adjusts to its wartime reality. Reliable access to water is another story, however, as Russian shelling regularly leaves the town&#x2019;s residents without water for several days, or even sometimes weeks.

Her small shop, located in Oleksiyevo-Druzhkivka, a village close to Druzhkivka, is always busy. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s mostly our boys here. We work for them. We see them off to their positions and meet them when they come back,&#x201D; she says. Radchenko calls her shop a &quot;lost and found.&quot; She keeps lost phones and even a single lost mitten. Under the counter, she has a small handmade toy cat that someone left behind. &#x201C;It was the guys coming from their positions. It was dark, someone lost it. I want the owner to be found. I hope to God that he is alive,&#x201D; Radchenko says. She has been looking for the toy&#x2019;s owner for several months now, but says no one has heard anything about the soldier whom it belongs to, who goes by the call sign &#x201C;Docent.&#x201D; The small shop where Halina Radchenko works in Oleksiyevo-Druzhkivka, a village close to Druzhkivka, Ukraine on Dec. 16, 2024.

It sells hot dogs, coffee, socks, razor blades, cigarettes, deodorants &#x2014; everything soldiers might need while on the front. &#x201C;We already know who likes what. We don&apos;t even need to ask them,&#x201D; adds Radchenko. Russia&#x2019;s attacks are gradually destroying the area&#x2019;s businesses and centers of community life. The historic Druzhkivka factory that produced some of the country&#x2019;s most beloved sweets, including halva, was destroyed in a Russian attack in October 2024. The Altair Ice Arena &#x2014; Ukraine&#x2019;s largest hockey and figure skating rink &#x2014; was struck in a missile attack in January 2023. And an orphanage and boarding school in Druzhkivka that served over 200 children with disabilities before the full-scale invasion was destroyed in March 2023. Despite being so close to the frontline, the local authorities are developing a plan to restore the town, even as the war continues. They are confident that Druzhkivka will have peace, development, and a future as part of Ukraine. &#x201C;We understand that we are on the right track, in the right place, at the right time,&#x201D; Khomchenko says.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-are-where-we-are-needed-the-people-who-choose-to-stay-in-front-line-areas-in-wartorn-donetsk-oblast/	2025-02-03T10:32:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/IMG_0359.JPG
Ukrainian commander involved in liberation of Kharkiv Oblast killed in combat	Anton Spitsyn, who led one of the battlegroups of the Omega special forces, part of the National Guard, died of wounds sustained during a combat mission, Spitsyn&apos;s brother, Oleksandr, wrote on Facebook on Feb. 3. Spitsyn was one of the co-founders of the unit, called the Peaky Blinders after the British crime drama series of the same name. Spitsyn&apos;s unit is currently defending Kharkiv Oblast. Spitsyn had served in Ukraine&apos;s National Guard since the first days of the full-scale invasion launched by Russia on Feb. 24, 2022. &quot;Today is the darkest and hardest day of my life. Today my brother left me. He was the closest and dearest person to me,&quot; Oleksandr Spitsyn wrote. &quot;He lived as a hero and died as a hero.&quot; Anton Spitsyn was born and raised in Kharkiv Oblast. Prior to the full-scale invasion, he owned a construction business and was involved in charity work, particularly teaching English to orphans for free, the Omega special forces statement read. Moscow&apos;s forces have ramped up pressure in Ukraine&apos;s east as Ukrainian troops find themselves increasingly outnumbered and outgunned. Russian forces have been attempting to force the Oskil River in Kharkiv Oblast for months in an attempt to outflank Ukrainian soldiers. Andrii Besedin, head of the Kupiansk town military administration, said on Jan. 9 that Moscow&apos;s troops are trying to secure a bridgehead in the town of Dvorichna on the river&apos;s Ukraine-held western bank. Besedin also said that Russian forces are now within 2 kilometers (1.5 miles) of Kupiansk&apos;s outskirts, adding that the situation is &quot;very difficult.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-commander-involved-in-liberation-of-kharkiv-oblast-dies-on-combat-mission/	2025-02-03T10:20:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/474857526_593641620315938_662519797290556589_n.jpg
Let's leave judgment to historians' — Orban evades question of whether he considers Russia responsible for war	Prime Minister Viktor Orban evaded answering the question of whether he personally considers Russia an aggressor state, proposing to &quot;leave judgment to historians,&quot; Swiss media outlet Neue Zurcher Zeitung reported on Feb. 3. Orban, whose government is widely regarded as the EU&apos;s most Russia-friendly, has repeatedly criticized aid for Ukraine, arguing it prolongs and escalates the war. &quot;Let&apos;s leave the judgment to the historians. I am a politician, and we have an EU decision. It obliges me to speak of &apos;Russian aggression,&apos;&quot; Orban told Neue Zurcher Zeitung. Orban also believed that Russia did not pose a threat to Hungary despite Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s 2021 demands for NATO to return to its 1997 borders that excludes Hungary and other Central European states from the alliance. &quot;I asked him (Putin) directly whether he had a problem with Hungary&apos;s NATO membership. He said no. Because we don&apos;t have any weapons stationed on our territory that Russia sees as a threat,&quot; Orban said. &quot;He is concerned with long-range tactical weapons. It&apos;s hard to imagine the Hungarians invading Moscow (laughs),&quot; the prime minister added. During the interview with Neue Zurcher Zeitung, Orban once again called for peace talks to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine and said that without them, Ukraine risks becoming &quot;the Afghanistan of the European Union.&quot; Orban&apos;s remarks come amid strained relations between Hungary and the EU. Previously, the European Commission criticized Hungary for failing to meet democratic standards, particularly regarding political financing, conflicts of interest, and media independence. Hungary will also not receive 1.04 billion euros ($1.08 billion) in aid from the EU due to violations of the rule of law. Budapest failed to meet the requirements, and thus lost funding, according to the European Commission.	https://kyivindependent.com/lets-leave-judgment-to-historians-orban-evaded-question-of-whether-he-considers-russia-aggressor-state/	2025-02-03T09:03:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1239783290.jpg
Raiffeisen Bank cooperates with companies supplying Russian army, Bloomberg reports	The Russian wing of Raiffeisen Bank International cooperates with companies that supply to the Russian army, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 3. Raiffeisen is the largest Western bank continuing to operate in Russia. Hesitant to fully withdraw from the Russian market, the bank eventually announced in July 2024 that it would &quot;drastically&quot; reduce its operations in the country. Over the past year, Raiffeisen in Russia received over 62 million rubles ($620,000) for servicing the Russian chemical company Unichim, that isn&apos;t under sanctions, yet provides sanctioned companies with components to produce military equipment, according to Bloomberg. Raiffeisen Bank cooperated with Unichim by involving accounts in banks such as Sberbank, VTB, Soledarnost (&quot;solidarity&quot; in English), and others under sanctions. Unichim also supplied acids to the Russian company Ravenstvo (&quot;equality&quot; in English) from under sanctioned. The deliveries were made for a project that specialized in developing and modernizing multiple launch rocket systems and aerial bombs. Ravenstvo, which mainly develops radar systems, is a division of the sanctioned Russian concern Granit-Electron, a manufacturer of key elements for missile systems. The company cooperated with the Proletarsky Shipyard, part of Russia&apos;s largest shipbuilder, the United Shipbuilding Corporation. Raiffeisen Bank also handled transactions for TotalElectro, a cable supplier to the Smolensk Aviation Plant, Bloomberg reported. The bank probably has other clients that facilitate supplies to the Russian defense industry, Bloomberg reported. Earlier in September, a Russian court issued a preliminary ruling that banned the transfer of Raiffeisen shares. &quot;This complicates the sales process&quot; and will &quot;inevitably lead to further delays&quot; in Raiffeisen&apos;s exit from Russia, the company said. Due to limitations imposed by the Russian government, Raiffeisen cannot transfer these funds to its parent company in Austria, which has led to the accumulation of 4.4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) of excess capital in Russia, according to Bloomberg. In 2023, the Russian branch of Raiffeisen Bank earned over $1 billion in the first three quarters, which accounted for about 50% of the group&apos;s total profit. The bank also paid 277 million euros ($284 million) in taxes to Russia over the same period, the media outlet added.	https://kyivindependent.com/raiffeisen-bank-cooperates-with-companies-supplying-russian-army-bloomberg-reports/	2025-02-03T08:00:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/reiff.jpg
Romanian presidential candidate says his claims on Ukraine's partition are 'theoretical'	Romanian presidential candidate Calin Georgescu said his recent claims about the partition of Ukraine&apos;s territories were &quot;an absolutely theoretical hypothesis,&quot; Digi24 reported on Feb. 3. Romanian far-right populist Georgescu tried to somewhat walk back on his remarks, days after he called Ukraine a &quot;fictional state&quot; and claimed that Ukraine&apos;s borders can change as a result of Russia&apos;s full-scale war, suggesting Romania could claim some of the country&apos;s territories. Speaking on Romanian television on Feb. 2, Georgescu said that politicians who criticize him for these words are &quot;short-sighted.&quot; &quot;I was talking about a very simple thing, by the way. We have to learn from our historical experience. The world is changing,&quot; Georgescu said. &quot;If we talk about the period of World War II, we made a lot of mistakes, we did not really understand how to position ourselves. And Greater Romania became Little Romania. This is the reality,&quot; he added. Georgescu&apos;s recent comments were also dismissed by Kyiv as revisionist and contrary to international norms, the U.N. Charter, and democratic values. &quot;His attempts to position himself as an &apos;independent&apos; politician look absurd &#x2014; the rhetoric he voiced is identical to Russian propaganda, indicating complete dependence on his masters in Moscow,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said. Earlier, similar remarks were made by other Romanian far-right politicians. Claudiu Tarziu, one of the leaders of Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) party, said his country should &quot;reunite&quot; with Moldova and the Ukrainian border regions of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and Zakarpattia. Zakarpattia Oblast is Ukraine&apos;s westernmost region with significant Hungarian and Romanian ethnic minorities. The historical region of Northern Bukovina is a part of today&apos;s Ukrainian Chernivtsi Oblast, while Bessarabia covers Moldova and parts of Chernivtsi and Odesa oblasts.	https://kyivindependent.com/romanian-presidential-candidate-says-his/	2025-02-03T07:35:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2191257472.jpg
24-year-old Ukrainian pilot killed in action	Ivan Bolotov, a 24-year-old Ukrainian pilot and captain of the 831st Tactical Aviation Brigade, was killed during a combat mission, the brigade said on Feb. 3. &quot;He was only 24, but he was a competent and experienced warrior who mercilessly beat the (Russian forces) on all their approaches and front lines,&quot; the statement read. Captain Bolotov has carried out Air Force flight missions since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, according to the brigade. According to the media reports, he had a wife and a five-month-old son. Another Ukrainian fighter pilot from the 299th Tactical Aviation Brigade was confirmed as killed in combat in December 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/24-year-old-ukrainian-pilot-killed-in-action/	2025-02-03T06:00:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/--------------2025-02-03-151324.png
Ukraine identifies soldier in severed head photo, documents Russian war crime	Editor&apos;s note: Due to its graphic nature, the editorial team has decided not to publish the footage circulated by Russian sources. Ukraine has preliminarily identified the decapitated Ukrainian service member whose photos were circulated online by Russian sources, said Artur Dobroserdov, the Commissioner for Persons Missing in Special Circumstances, on Feb. 3. The photo shows the severed head of a Ukrainian soldier being held, presumably, by a Russian soldier. The National Police will conduct investigations to clarify the circumstances of the incident, locate the body, and gather further details, Dobroserdov said. &quot;We urge you to refrain from spreading unverified information and trust only official sources of information,&quot; he added. The National Police has been tasked with contacting the soldier&apos;s relatives and investigating the case while Ukrainian authorities are documenting another violation of international humanitarian law by Russia. The Prosecutor General&apos;s Office was informed of the incident as part of ongoing efforts to document Russian war crimes. &quot;Each war crime is thoroughly documented, and the relevant information is transmitted to international legal institutions,&quot; Dobroserdov added. Ukrainian authorities have documented widespread violations of the Geneva Conventions by Russia, including the execution of 177 captured Ukrainian soldiers as of mid-December 2024. Cases of Russian forces decapitating Ukrainian troops have also surfaced in June and August 2024. The U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine reported a sharp increase in executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) by Russian forces, with 79 executions recorded in 24 separate incidents since August 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-identifies-soldier-in-severed-head-photo-documents-russian-war-crime/	2025-02-03T05:52:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1738887156.jpg
Ukraine's laser technologies 'already hit certain objects,' commander says	Ukraine is already using laser technologies to hit Russian targets, Colonel Vadym Sukharevskyi, commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces, said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty published on Feb. 3. &quot;Laser technologies are already hitting certain objects at a certain altitude,&quot; Sukharevskyi said. The commander first said in mid-December 2024 that Ukraine is among the few nations with laser weapon capabilities. According to Sukharevskyi, Ukraine&#x2019;s laser system, called Tryzub, can down aircraft at altitudes exceeding 2 kilometers. The Unmanned Systems Forces, established less than a year ago, already include combat and research units operating across air, land, and sea. When asked how successful the development of these technologies has been, Sukharevskyi said that the Ukrainian military&apos;s R&amp;D (Research and Development) &quot;involves a number of areas.&quot; The new system was the result of efforts to find an effective countermeasure against Russian aircraft and drones, specifically Shahed-type attack drones, he added. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify these claims. Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industry has gained momentum since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. In late January, the Unmanned Systems Forces said that Ukraine deployed a long-range drone capable of traveling up to 2,000 kilometers (1,242 miles) and carrying a 250-kilogram air bomb.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-using-laser-weapons/	2025-02-03T05:14:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2034676935.jpg
Russia sees Saudi Arabia, UAE as possible venues for Trump-Putin meeting, Reuters reports	Moscow views Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as potential venues for an anticipated meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump, Reuters reported on Feb. 3, citing two Russian sources. The report follows Trump&apos;s remarks that discussions involving Ukraine and Russia are progressing, though he provided few details. Since his election campaign, the U.S. president has pledged to broker a swift end to the war. Senior Russian officials have allegedly visited both Saudi Arabia and the UAE in recent weeks, according to Reuters. Some Russian diplomats and intelligence officials reportedly oppose the idea, citing the close military and security ties that both countries maintain with the United States. Russian officials have denied any direct contact with the U.S. regarding preparations for a phone call between Putin and Trump, which is expected to occur before an in-person meeting later this year. Trump has previously said he believes Putin is &quot;destroying Russia&quot; by refusing to reach a peace deal with Ukraine, adding that Moscow would be better off ending the war. Trump&apos;s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, told ABC News on Jan. 12 that Trump and Putin were expected to hold a telephone call &quot;in the coming days and weeks.&quot; On Jan. 24, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed that Putin was willing to engage in talks with Trump. Moscow has previously rejected key aspects of a peace proposal reportedly floated by Trump&apos;s team, which included freezing the front lines, delaying Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers. While Trump has not disclosed specific details about his plan to end the war, his team has indicated that the administration aims to preserve Ukraine&apos;s independence. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio nevertheless suggested that Kyiv and Moscow need to make concessions to reach a peace agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-sees-saudi-arabia-uae-as-possible-venues-for-trump-putin-meeting-reuters-reports/	2025-02-03T04:48:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1152488863.jpg
Kursk operation, long-range strikes in Russia — Syrskyi outlines Ukraine's priorities	Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi on Feb. 3 named Ukraine&apos;s operation in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast and strikes against military facilities deep inside Russian territory as Kyiv&apos;s key battlefield priorities. &quot;We continue effectively destroying Russia&apos;s military facilities to reduce its strike potential. We are destroying Russian forces both in Ukraine and Russia,&quot; Syrskyi wrote on social media. The commander outlined Ukraine&apos;s key priorities, including holding defensive lines, preventing Russian advances, and enhancing the use of unmanned systems. &quot;On the ground, first of all, we saturate units holding the defenses at the front line with personnel and equipment,&quot; Syrskyi said. He stressed the need to improve recruitment and psychological support for soldiers and better integrate newcomers from training centers before they undertake combat missions. Ukraine has intensified its long-range drone strikes on Russian oil facilities in the past weeks, aiming to disrupt fuel supplies to the Russian military and weaken Moscow&apos;s energy export revenues. Oil profits remain a key source of funding for Russia&apos;s war effort. In Kursk Oblast, Ukrainian forces have been holding positions since the start of the cross-border incursion in August 2024, reportedly seizing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukraine has since then lost roughly half of the captured area, fighting continues as Kyiv seeks to leverage its presence in Kursk Oblast in potential negotiations. Syrskyi also highlighted the importance of strengthening military training and improving recruitment and psychological support for troops. He also reported progress in reforming the Armed Forces&apos; organizational structure, including a shift to a corps-based system. Syrskyi earlier described Russia&apos;s ongoing offensive as &quot;one of the most powerful&quot; since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022. Despite persistent attacks, Russian forces have not achieved a significant breakthrough, though Ukrainian defenses remain under pressure across multiple sectors. &quot;February will not be easy for our troops, but Russia will also have a hard time. I have assigned tasks to the relevant commands and military authorities,&quot; Syrskyi added.	https://kyivindependent.com/kursk-operation-strikes-on-russian-military-targets-syrskyi-outlines-ukraines-priorities/	2025-02-03T04:33:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/2023-04-19-20.26.28.jpg
Biden admin's escalation fears, 'chaotic' organization delayed aid to Ukraine, Reuters reports	U.S. military aid to Ukraine was delayed not only by opposition from congressional Republicans but also by concerns within President Joe Biden&apos;s administration about escalating the conflict with Russia, Reuters said in its analysis published on Feb. 3. Further complicating deliveries was a chaotic weapons-tracking system in which different branches of the U.S. military reportedly used varying definitions of &quot;delivered,&quot; creating confusion over how much aid reached Ukraine. The most significant delays nevertheless stemmed from months of congressional gridlock in later 2023 and early 2024 over approving $60 billion in additional military assistance, mainly due to Republican resistance, the news agency wrote. Democratic and Republican lawmakers had urged House Speaker Mike Johnson for months to bring the aid package to a vote. Hard-line Republicans aligned with President Donald Trump reportedly pressured Johnson to block further assistance to Kyiv. Even after Congress approved the funding, U.S. military aid to Ukraine remained inconsistent, Reuters reported, citing sources in Washington and Kyiv. By November 2024, Ukraine had received only half of the military aid the U.S. had promised for that year from existing Pentagon stockpiles. According to the analysis, only 30% of the pledged armored vehicles had been delivered by early December. Until September, the Biden administration allocated an average of about $558 million per month to Ukraine. Following Trump&apos;s victory in the presidential election, U.S. military aid surged, reaching levels not seen since mid-2023. Between October 2024 and Biden&apos;s departure from office on Jan. 20, 2025, U.S. assistance averaged $1.1 billion per month &#x2014; matching the pace set during the first two years of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Reuters&apos; findings are based on analyzing official U.S. spending data, congressional records, and interviews with over 40 U.S. and Ukrainian officials, lawmakers, and congressional aides. During his campaign, Trump suggested that Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky bear partial responsibility for Russia&apos;s ongoing war and pledged to negotiate a swift peace deal. Trump has frequently criticized Biden&apos;s support for Ukraine and touted his positive relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, raising concerns that he may pursue a settlement unfavorable to Kyiv. More recently, Trump has adopted a more confrontational stance toward Moscow, blaming Putin for failing to end the war and threatening Russia with economic consequences if a peace deal is not reached. The United States is Ukraine&apos;s largest military aid provider that has been supplying billions in security assistance since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The Trump administration has been evasive about whether the new U.S. president plans to cut support after taking office.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-admins-fear-of-escalation-chaotic-tracking-system-reportedly-delayed-us-aid-to-ukraine/	2025-02-03T04:24:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/biden.jpg
Ukrainian drones strike 2 major energy facilities in Russia, Kyiv confirms	Ukrainian drones attacked an oil refinery in Volgograd and a gas processing plant in Astrakhan in Russia overnight on Feb. 3, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. The drones, operated by the SBU and the Special Operations Forces, targeted the flare farm, two primary processing units, and two technological units at the Volgograd oil refinery, owned by Lukoil, one of Russia&apos;s largest oil producers, the source said. The gas condensate processing complex at the Astrakhan Gas Processing Plant was also reportedly damaged. The facility has halted operations as the fire continues. Both targeted facilities are said to be major fuel producers for the Russian military. The statement comes after Russian authorities reported fires and drone attacks against the Volgograd and Astrakhan oblasts overnight. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff later confirmed that Ukrainian forces were behind the attacks. &quot;The Volgograd oil refinery processes almost 6% of all oil in Russia,&quot; the source said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. This is the fifth attack on Russian oil refineries and other facilities in 2025, the source said. Ukrainian drones previously hit the Lukoil-owned oil refinery in Volgograd on Jan. 31. Recent drone strikes also attacked a refinery in Ryazan, a distillery in Tambov Oblast, and a chemical plant in Bryansk. The Ryazan Oil Refinery, one of Russia&apos;s largest, later suspended operations due to the damage.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-strike-russian-energy-facilities-kyiv-says/	2025-02-03T04:01:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-03_06-40-42.jpg
UN monitors see 'alarming rise' in executions of Ukrainian POWs by Russia	The U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine is alarmed over a sharp rise in executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) by Russian forces, according to a press release obtained by the Kyiv Independent on Feb. 3. A total of 79 such executions in 24 separate incidents have been recorded by the mission since the end of August 2024. Presumably, some of these incidents concern group executions. Ukrainian authorities have documented widespread violations of the Geneva Conventions by Russia during the war. Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said in an interview with Ukrainska Pravda that as of mid-December 2024, Kyiv had recorded the execution of 177 captured Ukrainian soldiers, with 109 of them last year. The U.N. mission interviewed witnesses and analyzed videos and photos published by Ukrainian and Russian sources showing killings or dead bodies of Ukrainian POWs. The mission also said it had documented the execution of an injured and incapacitated &#x2014; but not yet captured &#x2014; Russian soldier by the Ukrainian army in 2024. Kyiv has not commented on this report. Many Ukrainian soldiers who surrendered or were in the custody of the Russian forces were shot dead on the spot, according to the statement. Unarmed and wounded Ukrainian soldiers were also killed, witnesses said. The reported executions took place in areas where Russian offensive operations were ongoing. According to Danielle Bell, the head of the mission, Russian public figures have explicitly called for the inhumane treatment and execution of captured Ukrainian soldiers, with at least three such appeals recorded by the mission along with social media posts made by Russian military-linked groups. &quot;These incidents did not occur in a vacuum,&quot; Bell said. &quot;All allegations of execution of captured Ukrainian military personnel and public statements calling for, or condoning, such actions must be investigated.&quot; The statement that &quot;no quarter&quot; will be given is a serious violation of international humanitarian law and a war crime, according to the statement.	https://kyivindependent.com/un-mission-records-pow-executions/	2025-02-03T03:21:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1960109268-1.jpg
Pro-Russian collaborator Sarkisyan dies in hospital after Moscow explosion, media reports	Armen Sarkisyan, a pro-Russian collaborator from Donetsk Oblast wanted by Ukraine, died in the hospital after being injured in an explosion in an elite residential complex in Moscow on Feb. 3, the state news agency TASS reported, citing healthcare officials. Sarkisyan was severely injured when an unidentified explosive device went off in the lobby of one of the buildings in the&quot;Alye Parusa&quot; (Scarlet Sails) residential complex in northwestern Moscow. The collaborator was initially reported killed, but the Russian media later clarified he was transported to the hospital and had to undergo a leg amputation. Other Russian outlets, including the Interfax news agency, have since reported that Sarkisyan had died in the hospital. Sarkisyan was a crime boss and a close former associate of Ukraine&apos;s pro-Kremlin ex-President Viktor Yanukovych and has been on the international wanted list since 2014 for organizing murders in central Kyiv, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said. During the EuroMaidan Revolution, Sarkisyan reportedly organized the hired pro-government thugs (&quot;titushky&quot;) who harrassed pro-EuroMaidan protesters. After the full-scale war broke out, Sarkisyan founded the &quot;Arbat&quot; Separate Guards Special Purpose Battalion fighting against Ukraine. The unit is reportedly made up of ethnic Armenians, many of whom have criminal records. Russian law enforcement services suspect that Sarkisyan was a victim of a planned assassination, TASS reported. The explosion reportedly occurred when Sarkisyan and his security guards were entering the building. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. It is currently unclear who was behind the explosion.	https://kyivindependent.com/pro-russian-collaborator-sarkisyan-dies-in-hospital-after-moscow-explosion-media-reports/	2025-02-03T02:53:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/Sarkiysan.png
Ukraine foils Russian-backed plot to blow up Rivne Oblast railway, SBU says	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on Feb. 3 that it had prevented a sabotage attempt on a railway in Rivne Oblast, arresting a 23-year-old man allegedly working for Russian intelligence services. &quot;The man, on the instructions of the Russian intelligence services, came to the city of Sarny to blow up the railway tracks of the junction station through which trains with military equipment for the Armed Forces pass,&quot; the SBU said in a statement. The suspect was detained near the tracks while attempting to place explosives intended for remote detonation. Investigators learned that he was also tasked with gathering intelligence on military facilities in Lviv Oblast, according to the SBU. The SBU noted that the man had previously expressed pro-Russian views on social media and wanted to move to Russia. He had previously been prosecuted for desecrating Ukrainian soldiers&apos; graves and was reportedly recruited by Russia due to his ideology. The man has been charged with high treason and sabotage under martial law, offenses punishable by life imprisonment and confiscation of property. The arrest comes days after the SBU dismantled a Russian spy network on Jan. 28 that was gathering intelligence on Ukrainian aircraft and aviation infrastructure for potential strikes.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-foils-russian-backed-sabotage-attempt-on-rivne-railway-security-service-reports/	2025-02-03T02:25:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/740a0900034e4c50e179738c2bd0a5a4.jpg
Syrskyi condemns recent violence against draft officers, calls for investigation	Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi on Feb. 3 condemned recent violent attacks against enlistment officers, calling for a full investigation and punishment of the perpetrators. &quot;In a short time, unfortunately, three shameful acts of violence occurred in different regions, in which servicemen were injured,&quot; Syrskyi said. In Poltava Oblast, a draft officer was shot dead overnight on Jan. 31 while escorting conscripts to the 199th training center. The alleged perpetrator was detained soon after. In Rivne, an explosive device detonated by an unknown attacker on Feb. 1 injured several service members, leaving one in serious condition. Another explosion on Feb. 2 in Pavlohrad, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, lightly wounded a service member. &quot;We expect a full and comprehensive investigation of these crimes. The perpetrators must be brought to justice,&quot; Syrskyi said. Ukraine has faced significant challenges in mobilizing troops to compensate for losses and rotate soldiers who have been on the front lines since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Corruption schemes to avoid service have further complicated recruitment efforts. Syrskyi acknowledged ongoing issues with the enlistment but emphasized the importance of public support for the military. &quot;The national defense of Ukraine is impossible without public support for the army and respect for the military,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/syrskyi-condemns-violence-against-recruitment-centers-calls-for-investigation/	2025-02-03T01:51:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/Syrskyi.jpg
It's beyond repair' — Musk aims to shut down USAID, claims Trump's backing	Elon Musk said on Feb. 3 that he discussed closing the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) with President Donald Trump, who allegedly agreed to shut it down. Musk, who heads the Department of Government Effectiveness (DOGE), has blasted the USAID as a &quot;criminal organization&quot; and pushed for its dissolution. The agency funds initiatives ranging from women&apos;s health in conflict zones and clean water access to HIV/AIDS treatment, energy security, and anti-corruption programs. &quot;With regards to the USAID stuff, I went over it with (the president) in detail, and he agreed that we should shut it down,&quot; Musk said during a conversation on X Spaces. Separately, Trump said that the agency is run by &quot;radical lunatics&quot; who need to be removed before the White House makes a final decision on the agency. Earlier reports suggested that the Trump administration aims to move the Congress-funded independent agency under the State Department. USAID&apos;s website has been offline since Feb. 2, signaling the agency&apos;s potential dissolution. &quot;What we have is just a ball of worms. You&apos;ve got to basically get rid of the whole thing. It&apos;s beyond repair,&quot; Musk added. Musk&apos;s comments follow reports that DOGE representatives accessed USAID&apos;s headquarters in Washington and gained entry to classified areas and data. Trump&apos;s administration reportedly placed two top USAID security officials on leave over the weekend after they attempted to block Musk&apos;s team from restricted areas. Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and over $30 billion in direct budget support to Ukraine. This funding has helped rebuild schools, finance bomb shelters, and equip hospitals with advanced medical equipment. Ukraine&apos;s parliamentary humanitarian and information policy committee has begun consultations with European counterparts on temporarily replacing U.S. funding provided through USAID.	https://kyivindependent.com/usaid-faces-shutdown-push-as-musk-claims-trumps-backing/	2025-02-03T01:45:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2176083179.jpg
Ukraine needs more than a leadership shake-up to fight financial crime	The recent shake-up at the State Financial Monitoring Service of Ukraine (SFMS), responsible for combating money laundering and terrorist financing, has drawn mixed reactions. Some see it as a step toward fighting corruption and financial crime, while others view the changes with caution, uncertain about the motivations behind the overhaul. But personnel changes, however symbolic, aren&#x2019;t the answer to systemic problems. Ukraine&#x2019;s financial system faces deeper challenges: an underutilized public-private partnership model, a gaping regulatory void in the virtual asset space, and a lack of clarity and capacity in financial investigations. Tackling these issues demands urgent, structural reforms &#x2014; not just new faces at the top. The situation is critical, with far-reaching consequences for Ukraine&apos;s future. As billions in international aid flow in and Ukraine pushes closer to European Union accession, the country&#x2019;s financial integrity has become a litmus test for both international trust and domestic accountability. This is Ukraine&#x2019;s moment to demonstrate its strength &#x2014; not only as a recipient of global support but as a reliable partner in the fight against financial crime. Globally, public-private partnerships (PPPs) have emerged as one of the most effective tools in fighting financial crime. PPPs involve collaboration between public institutions and private companies (in this case, financial institutions) to enhance information sharing, risk assessment, and coordinated action. The benefits of such cooperation are clear &#x2014; from Australia&#x2019;s rapid takedown of a multimillion-dollar laundering syndicate to Singapore&#x2019;s real-time financial crime collaboration platform. Ukraine, however, has yet to fully tap into this potential. The Center for Finance and Security (CFS) at RUSI, in collaboration with Ukraine-based Center for Financial Integrity (CFI), evaluated the current status of these initiatives in its first task force report, &#x201C;PPPs and Fighting Financial Crime in Ukraine.&#x201D; Private financial institutions, from banks to payment processors, possess the data, technology, and on-the-ground insight that could transform Ukraine&#x2019;s anti-money laundering efforts. Yet trust deficits and weak information-sharing mechanisms have stymied meaningful cooperation. To bridge this divide, Ukraine must go beyond ad hoc councils and discussions. Establishing a secure, real-time platform for collaboration &#x2014; focused on high-risk areas like monitoring cryptocurrency transactions or tracking suspicious cross-border payments &#x2014; would be a powerful first step. As trust builds, targeted pilot programs can pave the way for broader systemic change. A new era calls for deeper collaboration with businesses, the IT industry, and fintech companies to revolutionize the fight against financial crime.

(Ed Ram/Getty Images)Cryptocurrency was a lifeline for Ukraine during the first days of the war, enabling rapid international donations when traditional systems were too slow or rigid. Yet this success story comes with risks. Without clear regulations, virtual assets have also become a conduit for illicit financial flows. Despite two competing draft laws sitting in parliament since 2023, the sector remains largely unregulated, leaving Ukraine vulnerable. The solution is straightforward but requires political will. Ukraine must pass legislation designating a regulator, such as the National Securities and Stock Market Commission, to oversee virtual asset service providers (VASPs). A registry of these providers &#x2014; backed by compliance incentives and penalties &#x2014; should be implemented. Beyond legislation, Ukraine must conduct risk assessments of virtual asset flows, particularly in cross-border transactions. Regulatory sandboxes, where new technologies can be tested under supervision, could also foster innovation while maintaining oversight. The lack of clear regulatory oversight over virtual assets opens the door for Russia to weaponize cryptocurrency, using it to evade sanctions and mine bitcoins in gray zones. Addressing this issue is no longer solely about the financial system &#x2014; it&#x2019;s an integral part of national security. Financial investigations are the backbone of any effective anti-money laundering regime. Yet in Ukraine, they remain disjointed and inconsistent. Agencies lack not only the tools but also the clear roles and responsibilities necessary to act decisively. As a result, critical investigations stall or fail to deliver meaningful outcomes. To address this, Ukraine needs a foundational overhaul of its approach to financial investigations. First, the government should establish clear guidelines outlining the roles of each agency involved. Second, it should invest in capacity-building, providing investigators with advanced analytical tools and targeted training. A focus on parallel financial investigations &#x2014; where financial aspects of crimes are pursued alongside criminal probes &#x2014; would also strengthen outcomes. Finally, closer collaboration with international law enforcement could offer both technical expertise and moral support during this transformative period. Ukraine&#x2019;s wartime circumstances have understandably led to restrictions on access to public financial data, but these measures must remain temporary. Civil society and oversight bodies, both domestic and international, need access to this information to ensure accountability. Without transparency, Ukraine risks undermining its credibility at a time when trust is its most valuable currency. Many state registries have resumed operations, though access to certain data remains restricted to safeguard sensitive information. By balancing security with transparency, Ukraine could signal a commitment to accountability and allow citizens and allies alike to see its progress firsthand. Equally important, Ukraine must ensure that financial investigations lead to real-world consequences: convictions, asset recoveries, and a deterrent effect that criminals can&#x2019;t ignore. The number of convictions in money laundering cases remains disappointingly low, as does the success rate of asset recovery &#x2014; something the global financial crime watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force, is likely to view negatively in any upcoming evaluation. Leadership changes at the SFMS are not unimportant, but they are no substitute for meaningful reform. If Ukraine wants to be seen as a reliable partner &#x2014; not just a recipient of aid &#x2014; it must take bold, decisive action. Though the steps to address these challenges are clear, their execution demands political will and coordination. Ukraine must harness the power of public-private collaboration, close regulatory gaps in virtual assets, and build capacity for financial investigations. This moment presents a rare chance for meaningful change. With the world&#x2019;s eyes on its struggle for sovereignty and stability, real reform would send an unmistakable message: Ukraine is not just surviving but leading by example &#x2014; leaping forward with significant societal reforms, including in the fight against financial crime.

Explosion rocks Moscow residential complex, casualties reported	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. An explosion occurred in the lobby of the &quot;Alye Parusa&quot; residential complex in northwestern Moscow on Feb. 3, the state news agency TASS reported, citing emergency services. At least one person was killed and four injured, the Russian media reported. The injured victims reportedly include the security guards of the man killed in the blast. Citing sources, the pro-state outlet Kommersant identified the victim as Armen Sarkisyan, a pro-Russian collaborator from Donetsk Oblast wanted by Ukraine. Sarkisyan was a close associate of pro-Kremlin President Viktor Yanukovych and has been on the international wanted list since 2014 for his role in murders of protesters during the EuroMaidan Revolution, the Security of Service of Ukraine (SBU) said. &#xA0; The blast was caused by an unidentified explosive device, with Russian law enforcement services suspecting a murder plot, TASS reported, citing authorities. The explosion occurred when one of the building&apos;s residents &#x2014; the man killed in the blast &#x2014; entered the entrance with his security guards, the Russian Telegram channel 112 claimed.	https://kyivindependent.com/explosion-rocks-moscow-residential-complex-casualties-reported/	2025-02-03T00:07:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1247556676.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure 21 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least two civilians and injured at least 21 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Feb. 3. Russia launched 71 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones overnight, the Air Force said. Ukrainian air defenses reportedly shot down 38 drones, while 25 others were lost in the airspace without causing damage. In Kherson Oblast, Russian attacks killed one person and wounded 13 others, including two children, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. Russian forces also killed one resident of Donetsk Oblast in Myrnohrad. Another five people were wounded in the oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Kharkiv Oblast, a 39-year-old woman and a 53-year-old man were injured in a drone attack and suffered first and second-degree burns, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. A 70-year-old man was wounded in an attack on the Synelnykove district in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and is in moderate condition, Governor Serhii Lysak said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-5/	2025-02-02T23:50:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/photo_2025-02-02_17-23-58.jpg
Key Russian, North Korean officers killed in Ukraine's strike on Kursk Oblast command post, Zelensky says	A Ukrainian strike on a Russian command post in Kursk Oblast killed dozens of Russian and North Korean officers, President Volodymyr Zelensky told the Associated Press on Feb. 2. &quot;There was a strong operation by our military &#x2014; they hit their central command post in the Kursk direction. And they lost key officers of Russia and North Korea,&quot; Zelensky said in an interview. The strike, allegedly conducted by Ukraine&apos;s Missile and Artillery Forces on Jan. 31, targeted the command post of Russia&apos;s Kursk group of forces in the city of Rylsk. &quot;It was our military target, a fair one. There was a missile attack from our side and various types of weapons; a complex attack was launched against them,&quot; Zelensky added. The president also claimed that Russia had deployed around 12,000 North Korean troops to Kursk Oblast, of whom more than 4,000 &quot;had been lost.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. &quot;They lost the combat capability of this first package of North Koreans. I can&apos;t call them anything else because it&apos;s a package &#x2014; they don&apos;t know where they&apos;re going, and they&apos;re fighting against a country they&apos;ve never been to,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukrainian forces launched a cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in early August 2024, allegedly seizing about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukraine has since then lost roughly half of that area, the fighting continues. Kyiv hopes to leverage its presence in Kursk Oblast in potential peace negotiations. Last fall, North Korean troops were deployed to the area to support Russian forces in countering the Ukrainian incursion. North Korean troops have not been seen in the areas where Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces are fighting for roughly three weeks, the unit&apos;s spokesperson, Colonel Oleksandr Kindratenko, told the Kyiv Independent on Jan. 31. The comment came as undisclosed Ukrainian and U.S. officials told The New York Times that North Korean troops had been pulled from the front lines after suffering heavy casualties.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-strike-on-russian-command-post-kills-key-russian-north-korean-officers/	2025-02-02T22:54:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1850857121.jpg
Ukraine's drones reportedly strike Russian energy facilities in Astrakhan, Volgograd oblasts	Ukrainian drones attacked energy facilities in Russia&apos;s Astrakhan and Volgograd oblasts overnight on Feb. 3, causing fires, according to local authorities. The news comes as Ukraine ramps up long-range strikes against Russian energy infrastructure to stifle Moscow&apos;s gas and oil exports that fuel its war chest. Russian air defenses &quot;repelled a massive attack against Volgograd Oblast,&quot; Governor Andrei Bocharov claimed. &quot;Most of the drones were intercepted and neutralized. There were no casualties. Fallen debris caused fires on the territory of a local oil refinery,&quot; the governor said in a statement, reporting short-term voltage drops in the power grid. Volgograd residents reported at least 50 explosions during the night, with almost all of the drones intercepted over the local Lukoil oil refinery, the Russian Telegram channel Baza reported. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage allegedly showing a Ukrainian drone attack against Volgograd Oblast, Russia, overnight on Feb. 3, 2025. (Andrii Kovalenko/Telegram)The Lukoil refinery in Volgograd Oblast lies around 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the front line in Ukraine and was previously targeted by Ukrainian drones on Jan. 31. In Astrakhan Oblast, air defenses and electronic warfare systems were deployed to intercept drones attacking fuel and energy facilities, Governor Igor Babushkin claimed. &quot;A fire broke out after a crash of one of the drones,&quot; Babushkin said on his Telegram channel without specifying the exact location of the fire while reporting no casualties. Baza claimed that the fire broke out at the Astrakhan Gas Processing Plant. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage allegedly showing a Ukrainian drone attack against the Astrakhan Gas Processing Plant in Astrakhan Oblast, Russia, overnight on Feb. 3, 2025.

General Staff: Russia has lost 841,660 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 841,660 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 3. This number includes 1,300 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,920 tanks, 20,685 armored fighting vehicles, 35,798 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,589 artillery systems, 1,268 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,053 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 23,911 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-841-660-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-02-02T22:11:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/img-0974-1655999300w0hvt.jpg
EU leaders to discuss defense strategy against Russia, Trump’s tariffs	European Union leaders are meeting in Brussels on Feb. 3 to address the continent&#x2019;s defense strategy against Russia and to navigate the challenges posed by U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s recent tariff decisions targeting Canada, Mexico, and China. The leaders of the EU&#x2019;s 27 member states will convene at a former royal palace turned conference center, where they will be joined for lunch by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and later dine with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, according to Reuters. Antonio Costa, President of the European Council, has framed the gathering as a &quot;retreat&quot; rather than a formal summit, aiming to foster open discussions without official declarations or binding decisions. A key focus of the meeting is geopolitics and EU relations with the United States, with Trump&#x2019;s sweeping tariffs expected to dominate the agenda. EU officials are increasingly concerned that similar measures could soon be imposed on European exports. Additionally, Trump&#x2019;s demands for increased European defense spending and reduced reliance on NATO will be a major topic, particularly as he has called for EU member Denmark to relinquish Greenland to the U.S., further straining transatlantic relations. Costa emphasized the need for Europe to enhance its defense capabilities, adding in a letter to EU leaders that &quot;Europe needs to assume greater responsibility for its own defense. It needs to become more resilient, more efficient, more autonomous, and a more reliable security and defense actor.&quot; While countries like France and the Baltic states support joint EU borrowing for defense spending, Germany and the Netherlands remain opposed. A potential compromise could involve borrowing to finance loans rather than direct grants for defense projects, Reuters reports. European defense spending has risen significantly since Russia&#x2019;s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Last year, EU nations collectively spent an estimated 326 billion euros ($334.48 billion) on defense, an increase of 30% from 2021. Despite this, Trump has pushed for NATO&#x2019;s European members to allocate 5% of GDP to defense, a target that no member, including the U.S., currently meets.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-leaders-to-discuss-defense-strategy-against-russia-trumps-tariffs/	2025-02-02T21:39:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2154602469.jpg
Ukrainian FM calls Putin’s remarks on Zelensky’s legitimacy 'absurd'	Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha has dismissed Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s claims about President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s legitimacy, calling them &quot;absurd.&quot; &quot;Putin&apos;s remarks about the legitimacy of Ukraine&apos;s President are absurd. During his quarter-century stay in the Kremlin, Ukraine saw three presidents change in fair elections; President Trump returned for a second term after an impressive victory. This is democracy and legitimacy,&quot; Sybiha wrote in a post on X on &#xA0;Feb. 2. Putin has reiterated his claim that Zelensky is &quot;illegitimate&quot; and said that he has no right to sign any documents in potential peace negotiations, according to an interview with the state TV channel Rossiya 1 broadcast on Jan. 28. Russia has frequently promoted the narrative that Zelensky is illegitimate as part of its propaganda campaign to undermine the Ukrainian government. However, leading Ukrainian constitutional lawyers and legal experts assert that this claim is baseless and without merit. Sybiha further criticized Putin for consolidating power by dismantling Russia&#x2019;s constitution, suppressing opposition, shutting down independent media, and staging sham elections to remain in office for longer than Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. &quot;Now this person is lecturing the world on legitimacy. Give us a break,&quot; he added. According to Sybiha, Putin&#x2019;s statements are deliberate attempts to mislead foreign leaders and audiences. &quot;Only fools can trust them. If anyone&apos;s legitimacy is called into question, it is that of Moscow&apos;s dictator, who creates cannon fodder from men in their twenties born while he was already in power,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-fm-calls-putins-remarks-on-zelenskys-legitimacy-absurd/	2025-02-02T20:41:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187504899.jpg
Trump says talks with Ukraine, Russia 'going pretty well,' media reports	U.S. President Donald Trump said that discussions involving Ukraine and Russia are making progress, though he provided few details. &quot;We have meetings and talks scheduled with various parties, including Ukraine and Russia. And I think those discussions are actually going pretty well,&quot; Trump told reporters late on Feb. 2. Earlier in the day, Trump&#x2019;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, suggested that both nations would need to make concessions to negotiate an end to the war. &quot;President Volodymyr Zelensky has already indicated he will soften his position on land,&quot; Kellogg reportedly said, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. &quot;And [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is going to have to soften his positions as well.&quot; He added that discussions would continue in the near future, calling negotiations &quot;good for both sides.&quot; Zelensky has repeatedly ruled out any deal that would involve ceding territory to Russia, which currently occupies around 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory. Some of this land was taken during Russia&#x2019;s 2014 invasion, while the rest was captured following its full-scale assault in 2022. However, as Ukraine faces mounting battlefield losses, pressure is growing on Zelensky to consider compromises. The future of U.S. military aid to Ukraine remains uncertain. Kellogg noted that the previous administration provided $174 billion in assistance, a figure Trump has frequently criticized. Meanwhile, Russia has sustained heavy battlefield losses and continues to face economic strain due to military spending and Western sanctions. Trump has promised to end the war swiftly but has not disclosed any specific plans. On Jan. 31, Kellogg claimed the former president had a &quot;solid&quot; strategy to end the war within months.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-says-talks-with-ukraine-russia-going-pretty-well-media-reports/	2025-02-02T19:48:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173999809.jpg
Zelensky warns of Russia’s growing alliance with Iran, North Korea	President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that Russia has officially strengthened its alliance with Iran and North Korea, posing a direct threat to the United States. In an interview with the Associated Press on Feb. 2, Zelensky added that while these countries had previously cooperated on weapons and technology, they are now openly engaged in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. &quot;For the first time in decades, Russia has officially demonstrated its alliance by involving Iran and North Korea. Yes, they had relations before, exchanging technology, weapons, and so on, but now they have actively brought them into the war. Iran is supplying weapons, North Korea is providing both weapons and troops,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;(...) As of today, North Korea, Russia, and Iran form a concrete alliance against Ukraine and the entire West. I believe this is, in fact, an alliance against the United States. This is a very dangerous alliance.&quot; He emphasized that the three nations have deepened their military cooperation, effectively merging their defense industries to ramp up weapons production. &quot;These three countries, aside from being nuclear powers, are highly escalatory states, and they are certainly not about peace. They are now united, they are strategic partners. They have effectively merged their defense industries, and they will continue to expand and increase weapons production,&quot; he warned. Zelensky also raised concerns about North Korean troops stationed in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk region, saying they are gaining combat experience that could be used in future conflicts elsewhere. &quot;This is happening now, and it is very dangerous for the United States and for many countries in that region,&quot; he said. Earlier reports indicated that North Korean troops in the Kursk region had been undergoing rotations due to heavy losses. However, Ukraine&#x2019;s Special Operations Forces recently reported that no North Korean presence had been detected in the region for about three weeks.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-warns-of-russias-growing-alliance-with-iran-north-korea/	2025-02-02T18:52:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1850857121.jpg
Trump administration removes more USAID staff as agency faces uncertain future, CNN reports	The Trump administration removed two top security officials from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) over the weekend after they attempted to prevent representatives from Elon Musk&#x2019;s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from accessing restricted areas, CNN reports. The removals are part of a broader effort by Trump&#x2019;s team to strip USAID of its independence. Nearly 100 senior career staff members have been placed on leave as discussions continue about shifting the agency under State Department control. A senior Senate Democratic aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that DOGE personnel entered USAID headquarters without security clearances and were initially turned away by agency security officers. However, the officers were allegedly threatened with action by the federal Marshals Service. Shortly afterward, USAID&#x2019;s security director, John Voorhees, and his deputy were removed from their positions. DOGE officials accessed offices containing classified materials and personal data, though it remains unclear what information was obtained. In response, DOGE spokesperson Katie Miller said on social media that &quot;no classified material was accessed without proper security clearances.&quot; The shake-up has raised legal concerns, with congressional Democrats warning that dismantling USAID&#x2019;s independence could violate U.S. law. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Jeanne Shaheen has formally requested an explanation from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Meanwhile, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Brian Mast voiced support for placing USAID under State Department oversight: &quot;There needs to be more command and control,&quot; according to Reuters. The agency&#x2019;s website has been offline since Feb. 2 afternoon, a sign that USAID could be nearing its dissolution. The agency&#x2019;s funding supports initiatives ranging from women&#x2019;s health in conflict zones and access to clean water to HIV/AIDS treatment, energy security, and anti-corruption programs. Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, USAID has played a vital role in supporting the country. The agency has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support. This funding has helped rebuild schools damaged by Russian attacks, finance bomb shelters, and supply hospitals with advanced medical equipment. Billionaire Elon Musk, whom Trump appointed to lead a federal cost-cutting panel, has ramped up his attacks on USAID, calling it &quot;a criminal organization&quot; on his social media platform X and declaring that it is &quot;Time for it to die.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-administration-removes-more-usaid-staff-as-agency-faces-uncertain-future-cnn-reports/	2025-02-02T16:56:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2172231465.jpg
Russia used US banks to send billions to Turkey, dodging sanctions, WSJ reports	A U.S. Justice Department investigation found that Russia funneled billions of dollars through American banks to Turkey in 2022, using the Akkuyu nuclear power plant project as cover to evade sanctions, according to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup facilitated more than $5 billion in transfers linked to the Russian-backed project, with at least $2 billion later frozen by U.S. authorities. The Justice Department suspects the scheme was orchestrated at the highest levels in Moscow, with the Bank of Russia secretly funding a $9 billion loan through Gazprombank. This allowed Russian money to flow into Turkey while avoiding direct transactions with sanctioned entities. Officials believe the transfers were designed not just for nuclear construction but also to create an offshore dollar reserve for Russian state initiatives. Despite prosecutors&#x2019; efforts to seize the frozen funds in 2024, the Biden administration halted the case, fearing diplomatic fallout with Turkey, a NATO ally. The White House and State Department worried legal action could strain cooperation on prisoner exchanges, counterterrorism, and Middle East stability. A key concern was the suspected involvement of Turkish intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin and former finance minister Nureddin Nebati in facilitating the payments. Turkey, unlike other NATO members, has refused to impose sanctions on Russia and has expanded trade with Moscow while simultaneously providing weapons to Ukraine. The country&#x2019;s financial system benefited from the Russian transfers as the Turkish central bank sought to stabilize the lira amid inflation. With the case now on hold, the Trump administration must decide whether to pursue action. During his first term, tensions flared between Washington and Ankara over sanctions violations involving Turkey&#x2019;s state-owned Halkbank.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-used-us-banks-to-send-billions-to-turkey-dodging-sanctions-wsj-reports/	2025-02-02T15:40:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1028370860-1.jpg
Russian vice-governor and military commander killed in Kursk Oblast, Astra reports	Sergei Yefremov, Vice-Governor of Russia&apos;s Primorsky Krai and commander of the Tiger military unit, was killed in Kursk Oblast, Russian Telegram news channel Astra reported on Feb. 2. According to reports from another Russian channel Mash, Yefremov&#x2019;s vehicle struck a mine and exploded, killing him and another officer. &quot;While returning from a combat mission, Sergei Yefremov, the commander of the Tiger unit, was killed,&quot; Primorsky Krai Governor Oleg Kozhemyako said. The Tiger volunteer unit was formed in 2022, and Yefremov took command of it in Aug. 2024. Following his new appointment, his unit was deployed to Kursk Oblast. Kyiv&apos;s limited incursion into Kursk Oblast began on Aug. 6, 2024, when Ukrainian forces temporarily captured about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukraine has reportedly lost around half of that territory since then, fighting continues in the region. Ukraine hopes to leverage its presence in the area in potential peace negotiations. Last fall, North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast to support Russian forces in countering the Ukrainian incursion.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-vice-governor-and-military-commander-killed-in-kursk-oblast-astra-reports/	2025-02-02T13:54:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/efremov.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Poland scrambles jets, puts air defense on high alert during Russian missile attack on Ukraine	Key developments on Feb. 1-2: Polish and other allied aircraft were quickly mobilized on Feb. 1 in response to a large-scale missile attack by Russia on western Ukraine, Poland&apos;s Armed Forces reported on X. &quot;Attention, due to the attack of the Russian Federation performing strikes on facilities located in the west of Ukraine, among others, the operation of Polish and allied aviation in our airspace has begun,&#x201D; the statement said. All available forces and means were activated during the attack, the command said, adding that it was constantly monitoring the situation. In accordance with procedures, fighter jets were dispatched, and ground-based air defense and radar reconnaissance assets were put on high alert, the Polish military said. Russia launched a combined attack of 165 &#xA0;unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and missiles at Ukraine overnight and in the morning on Feb. 1, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported. Ukrainian air defense intercepted 56 Russian UAVs, the Air Force said. At least seven people were killed and 14 injured in a residential building strike in Poltava. Civilian enterprises and infrastructure in Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, Sumy, Kharkiv, Khmelnytsky, and Kyiv oblasts were damaged, according to the report. Poland has scrambled jets amid Russian attacks on Ukraine several times over the past year. Russia is building a new naval base in Ochamchire, Abkhazia, a move that raises fears Georgia could be drawn into the war in Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reports. The base is part of Moscow&#x2019;s strategy to safeguard its naval forces after suffering heavy losses in the Black Sea. Since launching its full-scale invasion in 2022, Russia has lost or sustained damage to roughly a third of its fleet in the region. Satellite images obtained by the outlet show continued upgrades at the Ochamchira port, including expanded access points to fit larger vessels. Though relatively small, experts say the facility could host ships equipped with cruise missiles, bolstering Russia&#x2019;s military presence in the Black Sea. Ochamchire, more than 700 kilometers southeast of the nearest Ukrainian-controlled territory, could provide Moscow with a naval base that remains largely beyond the range of Ukraine&#x2019;s existing long-range strikes. Russia has occupied Abkhazia after a war with Tbilisi in 2008, backing local breakaway leadership. The region is internationally recognized as Georgia&apos;s sovereign soil. The Wall Street Journal reports that if Ukraine were to target Russian warships there, Georgia could find itself pulled into the war. Beyond military risks, the base threatens a key trade route between Asia and Europe. Before Russia&#x2019;s invasion, more than 85% of land-based trade between China and Europe moved through Russian territory. Sanctions have disrupted that route, shifting attention to the Middle Corridor, which runs through Georgia. The World Bank estimates this corridor could handle 11 million tonnes of cargo annually by 2030, up from less than 3 million tonnes in 2023. A large-scale fire broke out at a warehouse in Kharkiv after a Russian drone struck a civilian enterprise late at night on Feb. 1, Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service reported. Russia launched a drone attack against the city&apos;s Slobidskyi district, causing a massive fire in a production and warehouse facility. The fire spread over an area of 2,000 meters, the State Emergency Service said. Firefighters contained the blaze at 1:27 a.m. local time on Feb. 2. The warehouse was part of a civilian enterprise, according to authorities. No casualties have been reported. Located less than 30 kilometers from the Russian border, the northeastern city of Kharkiv has suffered relentless aerial attacks over the past two years of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Moscow often targets densely populated neighborhoods and civilian infrastructure with missiles, drones, and glide bombs. Some 15,000 Russian soldiers were &quot;neutralized&quot; by Ukrainian forces in the Pokrovsk direction in Donetsk Oblast during January, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Feb. 2. In a post on Facebook that included a video of combat footage, Syrskyi said the area &quot;remains one of the hottest&quot; on the front, adding Ukrainian forces were &quot;continuously inflicting losses on the occupiers.&quot; &quot;In January of this year alone, our soldiers neutralized more than 15,000 invaders here, of which about 7,000 were killed,&quot; he added. 0:00/0:541&#xD7;The video released by Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi on Feb. 2 of combat in the Pokrovsk sector (Facebook) The Kyiv Independent could not verify the figures. A report from the monitoring group DeepState, published on Jan. 28 said that overall across the front lines, the intensity of Russian assaults was declining, but remains high. It added that Russian forces have concentrated 44% of their attacks in the Pokrovsk sector, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian troops in Donetsk Oblast. Russian forces were deploying small groups in an attempt to encircle Ukrainian troops in the sector, Viktor Trehubov, spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces, said on Jan. 27. The peak intensity of Russian offensive efforts across the front lines was recorded in the second half of December, following a surge in attacks that began in late November. According to data published by Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, 840,260 of Moscow&apos;s troops have been injured or killed since 2022. Russian losses in Ukraine are helping fuel a demographic timebomb that could see the country&#x2019;s population reduced by half by the end of the century, experts told the Kyiv Independent earlier this month.. &quot;The impact on Russian society is devastating,&quot; said Harley Balzer, emeritus professor of government and international affairs at Georgetown University. &quot;From Russia&apos;s perspective, (winning the war in Ukraine) is the smaller problem. The bigger issue is, is it going to be a viable country afterward regardless?&quot; Five people, among them two children, were injured after Russia targeted a minibus with a drone, Kherson Oblast Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on Feb. 2. A 12 year-old boy and a 13 year-old girl, along with three adult women, have been diagnosed with concussions after the attack. &quot;All the victims have been taken to medical facilities, where doctors are providing them with the necessary assistance,&quot; Prokudin wrote. Kherson Oblast remains under partial Russian occupation on the left bank of the Dnipro River. The region, including the city of Kherson, is frequently targeted by Russian forces, with regular attacks resulting in civilian casualties. Drone attacks targeting civilians in the southern city of Kherson have become so frequent that locals speaking to the Kyiv Independent last year &#xA0;described the violent campaign as a &quot;human safari.&quot; Under international law, the intentional targeting of civilians who are not actively engaged in hostilities during wartime constitutes a war crime.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-poland-scrambles-jets-puts-air-defense-on-high-alert-during-russian-missile-attack-on-ukraine/	2025-02-02T12:29:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/fire.jpg
Multiple Georgian opposition leaders arrested as pro-EU demonstrators block highway in Tbilisi	Georgian police arrested two opposition leaders, including the former mayor of Tbilisi, during a street protest against the ruling Georgian Dream party, Echo of the Caucasus reported on Feb. 2. Along with former Tbilisi Mayor Gigi Ugulava, the leader of EU-friendly party &#x201C;Akhali&#x201D; Nika Melia was arrested as well. Both Melia and Ugulava had previously been imprisoned under the current government on charges widely criticized as politically motivated. The arrests took place as thousands of demonstrators attempted to block a major highway leading into Tbilisi, near the capital&#x2019;s main shopping center. Authorities warned that blocking the highway was a criminal offense, citing a recent legislative amendment on January 31 that added &quot;roads of international and domestic importance&quot; to the list of strategic objects. Officials stated that the protest near Tbilisi Mall fell under Article 222 of the Criminal Code, which carries penalties ranging from correctional labor to up to two years in prison. Several other protesters were also detained, with at least one reported injury. &quot;Fire to the oligarchy,&#x201D; &quot;No justice - no peace&quot;, the protestors chanted. The pro-Russian Georgian Dream party claimed a sweeping victory in the Oct. 26 elections amid widespread allegations of fraud and intimidation. The disputed results triggered mass demonstrations in Tbilisi. A second round of protests kicked off when Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced that Georgia&apos;s integration into the EU could be postponed until 2028. The controversial foreign agents law adopted earlier this year led the EU to effectively freeze Georgia&apos;s accession process. Hundreds of protestors have been arrested since the fall, and numerous cases have been reported of Georgian police using tactics such as tear gas and water cannons to disperse demonstrations.	https://kyivindependent.com/multiple-georgian-opposition-leaders-arrested-as-pro-eu-demonstrators-block-highway-in-tbilisi/	2025-02-02T11:23:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2181587481.jpg
Zelensky comments on Defense Procurement Agency dispute, says Umerov is entitled to make any decisions to prevent military supply delays	President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the conflict between the Defense Ministry and the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) on Feb. 2 in an interview with the Associated Press (AP), commenting that the Defense Minister has the right to do everything to ensure that there is no slowdown in supplies. &quot;We have a Defense Minister who clearly understands that, God forbid, there will be any interruptions somewhere from anyone in supporting our military: from drones to air defense, there will be not only military losses, there will be civilian losses, children will suffer, there will be more strikes, Russia will be stronger,&#x201D; Zelensky told AP. He also warned that if there were institutional problems affecting contracts or deliveries, immediate action was necessary to prevent interruptions. Zelensky emphasized that there should be no pauses in supply of artillery packages. &#x201C;Therefore, the Defense Minister has the right to do everything to ensure that there is no slowdown in supplies. Today, all of our money is in the Defense Ministry, in our army. And if there is money there, and some delivery has not come, then, frankly, he must do everything to prevent such problems from happening again... And he is doing it,&#x201D; Zelensky concluded. The dispute arose after the Defense Procurement Agency&#x2019;s head, Maryna Bezrukova, was suspended by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, despite her contract being extended. Arsen Zhumadilov was appointed as acting head. The Defense Ministry cited several reasons for her removal, including alleged failure to fulfill planned deliveries for the front, poor procurement planning and delays, lack of timely communication with the General Staff, and leaks of classified information, which are reportedly expected to be investigated. Umerov&apos;s decision to fire Bezrukova sparked backlash, as Ukrainian law grants supervisory boards the sole authority to appoint or dismiss state enterprise heads. The Anti-Corruption Action Center (ANTAC) accused the Defense Ministry of a &quot;hostile takeover,&quot; alleging it manipulated the state enterprise register to &quot;legitimize&quot; Zhumadilov&apos;s appointment.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-comments-on-defense-procurement-agency-dispute-says-umerov-is-entitled-to-make-any-decisions-to-prevent-military-supply-delays/	2025-02-02T10:06:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/ZelenskySyrskyi.jpg
Russia’s ‘appalling’ response to oil tanker crash caused ‘ecological catastrophe’ in Black Sea	On the night of Dec. 15, 2024, two Russian oil tankers, Volgoneft-212 and Volgoneft-239, sank in the Kerch Strait, a narrow maritime connection between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, off the coast of occupied Crimea. Both vessels were constructed for service on rivers, not on the open sea, and did not have valid sailing documents at the time of the disaster. The tankers also violated a weather-based ban on entering the Kerch Strait. The vessel crews then attempted for days to obtain an authorization to discharge their oil at a nearby port on the coast of Crimea. To no avail. A storm picked up, with waves reaching three meters. This brought an end to the service of Volgoneft-212 and Volgoneft-239, which had been in use since 1969 and 1973, respectively. While on Jan. 25, the Russian government officially declared that emergency services had finished an ongoing oil extraction operation, this only concerned one part of Volgoneft-239, which eventually drifted to the coast of Crimea following the wreckage. The remaining parts of this vessel, and all of Volgoneft-212, are currently only being &#x201C;examined underwater,&#x201D; with no attempts yet being made to haul them to shore or extract the fuel oil left in their reservoirs. According to Eugene Simonov, an expert with the Ukraine War Environmental Consequences Work Group (UWEC) who spoke to the Kyiv Independent, the sunken vessel parts are left untouched because Russian authorities simply do not have the appropriate equipment to extract oil from underwater reservoirs. As a result, according to Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, the head of science at the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Volgoneft wreckages could evolve into the &#x201C;worst ecological catastrophe&#x201D; Russia has seen in the 21st century. While oil spills have already occurred in the region in the past, the December incident surpasses anything the Black Sea has ever seen. In the closest comparable case, 1,300 tons of fuel oil were released in November 2007, also after a Russian tanker sank in the Kerch Strait. As for the most recent wreckage, estimates by Russian state-aligned media put the amount of fuel oil released at 3,700 tons. In late January, the fuel oil reached Ukraine&#x2019;s Odesa Oblast, with Ukrainian emergency services now also tasked with cleaning up the shores. According to Russian environmental experts, the seabed and the shores of Russia&#x2019;s Krasnodar Krai will be especially affected by the spill. Much of this is due to the type of fuel which was spilt. The Volgoneft tankers carried &#x201C;heavy&#x201D; oil, known as Mazut, which typically conglomerates into solid lumps that are heavier than water. As a result, the lumps sink and cannot be easily localized, which makes cleanup operations more difficult. Some lumps of &#x201C;heavy&#x201D; oil sink, covering the seabed and squashing life beneath. Others eventually wash up on nearby coasts, polluting shoreline waters and beaches. In comparison, so-called &#x201C;light&#x201D; oil typically floats at the surface, spreading in black pools. While the immediate effects of such a spill can be more drastic, cleanup operations are more straightforward. Volunteers clean up a bird from oil following mid-December tanker crash in the Kerch Strait, in the settlement of Vityazevo in the southern Russian Krasnodar Krai, on Jan. 12, 2025. (Stringer/AFP via Getty Images)In the case of &#x201C;heavy&#x201D; oil, lumps can continue washing up on shorelines for months. Some of those that sink remain there until they are dissolved by microorganisms, which can take years if not decades. According to Natalia Gozak, director of Greenpeace Ukraine, the Black Sea is currently going through its peak of immediate contamination. While this wave might be over soon, the released fuel oil will now move along the maritime food chain, making fish and other wildlife in the sea unsuitable for consumption. In total, the Black Sea might need 10 to 12 years to rid itself from the oil spill, Gozak told the Kyiv Independent. Regardless of this, Russian public health officials were quick to claim that fish from the Black Sea was safe to eat, even if it came from affected areas. Certain types of fish are, however, already becoming difficult to find on sale in the Krasnodar Krai, Russian media reported. According to a Russian ecologist and oil spill expert who spoke to the Kyiv Independent on conditions of anonymity, the reaction by Russian authorities was in fact &#x201C;appalling.&#x201D; Actions taken in the first days following such disasters are crucial, and in the case of the Black Sea oil spill, authorities &#x201C;hardly reacted at all&#x201D; within this time frame. Authorities only started reacting after the disaster went viral on Russian social media, the expert said. &#x201C;Normally, in all countries, there are protocols for what to do in such situations. In Russia, there are also such plans for oil spills, and legislation is highly developed. However, the issue is that these plans and legislation were not applied.&#x201D; In the first weeks, Russian authorities &#x201C;acted without any plan&#x201D; to manage the effects of the disaster, according to Simonov. &#x201C;The main instinct of the responsible officials was rather classic: to hide from higher-up (authorities) their inability to manage the consequences of a rather trivial (oil) spill,&#x201D; the expert said. Authorities only started taking appropriate measures after Vladimir Putin reacted to the situation, Simonov claimed. Volunteers clean up a bird from oil following mid-December tanker crash in the Kerch Strait, in the settlement of Vityazevo in the southern Russian Krasnodar Krai, on Jan. 12, 2025. (Stringer/AFP via Getty Images)Inaction by authorities forced locals in affected Russian regions to self-organize, as explained in turn by the anonymous Russian expert. As a result, cleanup operations were conducted haphazardly, without adequate material, creating serious health risks for the hundreds of volunteers who rushed to the shoreline of Krasnodar Krai. The region, which lies east of the Black Sea waters, seems for now to be the most affected by the disaster. As part of the improvised cleanup operation, fuel oil lumps which washed up on its shores were gathered into bags in order to be utilized. However, these bags reportedly never reached processing plants, creating further environmental and public health concerns. The response by authorities in occupied Crimea was &#x201C;even weaker,&#x201D; Gozak claimed, meaning that the disaster will have lasting effects on the peninsula. According to a Russian environmental expert who spoke to Kedr, an independent news outlet that focuses on environmental issues, Russian authorities likely did not even have enough adequate equipment to deal with the consequences of the oil spill. Although conditions in the Black Sea were extreme at the time of the incident, authorities should have trained emergency services to respond to such situations, according to the anonymous Russian expert who spoke to the Kyiv Independent. Volunteers clean up the shore from fuel oil following mid-December tanker crash in the Kerch Strait, in the southern Russian Krasnodar Krai, Dec. 20, 2024. (Krasnodar Krai Emergency Service)On a positive note, the Black Sea is a dynamic ecosystem with warm waters, which increases the likelihood that the area will be able to clean itself from the fuel oil, possibly even within a year, the expert claimed. Simonov, on the other hand, argued that Mazut fuel oil will remain on the seabed and contaminate ecosystems for the next 10 to 20 years. &#x201C;After the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam, this is the second-largest environmental catastrophe in Ukraine since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion,&#x201D; Gozak said. &#x201C;These accidents are really dramatic, and the worst is that they could have been prevented.&#x201D; Central to understanding this crisis, according to Gozak, is Russia&#x2019;s use of its so-called &#x201C;shadow fleet,&#x201D; which the United States began to go after in the final days of Joe Biden&#x2019;s presidency. In 2022, the EU introduced sanctions on Russian oil delivered by sea, making it in theory impossible for Russia to charter or insure oil tankers which did not comply with the sanctions regime. However, Russia was soon able to circumvent these sanctions, using various schemes to ship its oil worldwide. As these tankers are in a legal gray zone, they often do not comply with security regulations and are not properly insured. This last element makes it even more difficult to coordinate the ongoing Black Sea cleanup operations, as the responsibility of companies running &#x201C;shadow fleet&#x201D; vessels is unclear. The shore polluted with fuel oil following mid-December tanker crash in the Kerch Strait, in the southern Russian Krasnodar Krai, Dec. 20, 2024. (Krasnodar Krai Emergency Service)&#x201C;Stopping this shadow fleet could help prevent such catastrophes, (cut) funding for Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and, in the long run, help address climate change,&#x201D; Gozak said. Similar disasters could occur in the future if exports by Russia&#x2019;s &#x201C;shadow fleet&#x201D; continue, Simonov added. As for Ukraine, the environmental effect of the disaster is for now mainly felt in occupied Crimea, as well as in parts of the occupied regions of Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk, which are located on the shoreline of the Sea of Azov. While some oil lumps have also reached the Danube Delta south of Odesa, the amounts collected there are for now, symbolic.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-oil-tanker-crash-causes-ecological-catastrophe-with-black-sea-in-need-of-a-decade-to-recover/	2025-02-02T09:15:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/5474402793822480595-e1736416462922.jpg
The week ahead: Key developments impacting global politics & markets	Editor&apos;s note: This article is an on-site version of KI Insights&apos; The Week Ahead newsletter covering events from Feb. 3-Feb. 9. Sign up here to start your week with an agenda of Ukraine-related events, delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday. On Feb. 3-8, Washington will host the 4th annual Ukrainian Week, which seeks to build ties between US and Ukrainian policy-makers and church representatives. Pavlo Unguryan, a notable figure in Ukraine&#x2019;s outreach to US evangelicals, will lead the organization, which will include various religious, cultural, business, and diplomatic events. A delegation of Ukrainian MPs may meet with members of US President Donald Trump&#x2019;s team, according to David Arakhmia, head of the ruling Sluha Narodu faction in parliament. The status of US aid to Ukraine will likely be discussed (Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has asked for a government report on the criticality of affected programs; there is talk of appealing for exemptions). However, the main topic of any potential discussions will be the specifics of a US plan to end the war. Trump reaffirmed his desire to pursue a peace deal, hinting at using pressure on Russia to do so in 100 days. Still, Secretary of State Marco Rubio&#x2019;s emphasis that both Kyiv and Moscow would need to make concessions signals a difficult path forward. (Note: many in Kyiv are eagerly anticipating the next concrete steps in the process &#x2013; with both a visit by Special Ukraine-Russia Envoy Keith Kellogg and a Trump-Putin call being expected in the coming weeks). On Feb. 3, European leaders will meet at an &#x201C;informal retreat&#x201D; to discuss the potential deployment of troops to Ukraine. This meeting, including NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, aims to explore the feasibility, scope and political will for such a mission, as the war in Ukraine continues to demand stronger international support. The idea has gained traction recently, but it remains divisive among NATO allies. The UK, France, Nordic and Baltic countries are broadly seen as having a higher degree of readiness, while Poland and Germany are more cautious and will likely remain so until at least after their respective elections. (Of note, there is also discussion on the resumption of Russian gas imports). Effective from Feb. 5, Russia will implement an &#x201C;expulsion regime&#x201D; legislation targeting foreigners or stateless persons. Russian police will be granted enhanced authority to deport foreign nationals or facilitate the acquisition of legal residency status. The next Rada plenary (dates have not been set) will likely consider suspending ex-President Petro Poroshenko for six months for violating ethics rules. If supported, this would demonstrate the ruling coalition&#x2019;s ability to deliver 226 votes on a highly politicized issue.

5 people including 2 children injured in Kherson after Russia targets minibus with drone, governor says	Five people, among them two children, were injured after Russia targeted a minibus with a drone, Kherson Oblast Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on Feb. 2. A 12 year-old boy and a 13 year-old girl, along with three adult women, have been diagnosed with concussions after the attack. &quot;All the victims have been taken to medical facilities, where doctors are providing them with the necessary assistance,&quot; Prokudin wrote. Kherson Oblast remains under partial Russian occupation on the left bank of the Dnipro River. The region, including the city of Kherson, is frequently targeted by Russian forces, with regular attacks resulting in civilian casualties. Drone attacks targeting civilians in the southern city of Kherson have become so frequent that locals speaking to the Kyiv Independent last year &#xA0;described the violent campaign as a &quot;human safari.&quot; Under international law, the intentional targeting of civilians who are not actively engaged in hostilities during wartime constitutes a war crime.	https://kyivindependent.com/governor-5-people-including-2-children-injured-in-kherson-after-russia-targets-vehicle-with-drone/	2025-02-02T07:50:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1244779094.jpeg
Zaluzhnyi proposed Kursk-style incursion into Russia's Belgorod Oblast in 2022, Ukrainian general says	Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K., proposed an incursion into Russia&apos;s Belgorod Oblast in 2022 to protect Kharkiv Oblast, General Viktor Nazarov told the BBC on Feb. 2. The plan was similar to Ukraine&apos;s cross-border incursion into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk region, in August 2024, launched in part in a bid to prevent Russian forces from staging an attack on Sumy Oblast, which was carried out under the command of his successor, Oleksandr Syrskyi. Ukrainian troops seized around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory, though Kyiv has reportedly since lost roughly half of those gains. Clashes continue in the area with Russian forces bolstered by North Korean troops. &quot;The idea was to conduct an offensive on Russian territory, in the general direction somewhere at the junction of Kursk and Belgorod oblasts, toward Belgorod. A political decision was all that was needed,&quot; Nazarov told the BBC. Zaluzhnyi reportedly advocated for a strategy of encirclement or blockade aimed at cutting off the Russian military&#x2019;s ability to carry out fire and missile strikes on Kharkiv. The goal was to &quot;create a threat to the northeastern flank of the supply of material resources for the grouping operating in Donbas,&quot; Nazarov added. When asked why the incursion wasn&apos;t carried out in 2022, Nazarov replied that it was a &quot;political question.&quot; Prior to his dismissal in early February 2024, media reports circulated that the President&apos;s Office and Zaluzhnyi had conflicting ideas about how the war should be carried out. In Kursk Oblast, North Korea&apos;s troops fighting alongside Russian forces have been taking heavy losses and have reportedly been withdrawn from some parts of the front line. They have not been seen for roughly three weeks in the areas of Kursk Oblast where Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces (SOF) are fighting, the unit&apos;s spokesperson, Colonel Oleksandr Kindratenko, told the Kyiv Independent on Jan. 31. Syrskyi said on Jan. 19 that roughly half of the 11-12,000-strong North Korean contingent deployed to the embattled Russian region have been killed or wounded. Experts interviewed by the Kyiv Independent connected North Korea&#x2019;s high casualty rates to a lack of experience with modern warfare, the &quot;human wave&quot; tactics employed against entrenched Ukrainian positions, and the resolve of North Korean troops to avoid capture, even at the cost of their own lives. North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in early August 2024. Ukrainian forces have continued fighting in the region, hoping to leverage their positions for potential negotiations. On Jan. 22, Soldiers of the 8th Regiment of Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces released footage of them resisting a North Korean assault in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast for eight hours before retreating, killing 21 and wounding 40 soldiers. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage shared by Ukraine&apos;s Special Operation Forces that purports to show an engagement with North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast.

Russian independent media Meduza, German PR firm pull campaign featuring Ukrainian war victims after backlash	Independent Russian media outlet Meduza and a German PR agency both apologized on Feb. 2 for a promotional campaign that featured photos of Ukrainian war victims. The campaign used a photo of Yaroslav Bazylevych whose entire family was killed when a Russian missile hit their apartment building on Sept. 4 in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. His 7-year-old daughter Emilia, 18-year-old Daryna and 21-year-old Yaryna were killed together with his wife Yevhenia, 43, as they were making their way to a bomb shelter Meduza used a photo from his family&apos;s funeral, as well as other pictures of Ukrainian war victims in a promotional video as part of the campaign, which has now been pulled. Bazylevych told the Kyiv Independent on Feb. 1 that the images were used without his permission. In its apology, Meduza claimed &quot;the video was selected with care and in full compliance with legal requirements.&quot; &quot;Nevertheless, it included images of Ukrainians who had not given permission for their use. This was a mistake, and we deeply regret it,&quot; it added. Bazylevych told the Kyiv Independent he considered the use of his photo &quot;unacceptable.&quot; Berlin-based Lure PR agency, which worked on the campaign with Meduza, also issued a public apology on Feb. 2, specifically mentioning the footage of Bazylevych in its campaign which provoked outrage from Ukrainians. The PR agency claimed that their intention was to &quot;stand in solidarity with Ukraine and support independent journalism that challenges Russian propaganda.&quot; The ad campaign has been removed from the agency&apos;s website. Yaroslav Bazylevych&apos;s photo from the funeral of his family, killed in a Russian strike, on the Lure agency&apos;s website that developed a promo campaign for a Russian media outlet Meduza. (Lure / Official website)&quot;We deeply regret that our approach caused distress, particularly regarding the inclusion of Yaroslav Bazylevych,&quot; Lure said in a statement released on their official Instagram. &quot;We have listened to concerns raised and, together with Meduza, have taken the campaign down. We remain committed to supporting those fighting for truth and justice against Russia&apos;s brutal war and propaganda machine.&quot; Meduza has not publicly stated who financed the campaign or where the funds to support it originate from. When asked by the Kyiv Independent who financed the campaign, a spokesperson for Meduza sent a link to the public statement with no further comment. The campaign was met with swift criticism in Ukraine, by both officials and the public. &quot;Exploiting our tragedy to evoke sympathy for Russians is a complete disgrace,&quot; said Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry in a statement. &quot;We demand that all such promo content exploiting Ukrainian suffering caused by Russian terror be removed immediately from all media platforms where it has appeared,&quot; said Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi. Founded in 2014, Meduza, an independent Russian news outlet headquartered in Latvia, was designated a &quot;foreign agent&quot; by Moscow in 2021. The ad campaign was supposed to expand its reach among English-speaking audiences.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-pr-agency-apologizes-for-meduza-campaign-featuring-ukrainian-war-victim/	2025-02-02T05:56:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2174646356.jpg
18-year-old injured in Russian drone attack on Sumy dies	Eighteen year-old Denys Zhurba has died from his injuries following the Jan. 30 Russian drone attack on Sumy, the Sumy City Council reported on Feb. 2. Zhurba sustained severe injuries from the attack when a shahed-type attack drone struck a multistorey building in Sumy shortly after midnight local time. The attack was part of a broader assault involving 81 attack and decoy drones launched against Ukraine. Zhurba&apos;s classmates launched a fundraising campaign for his medical treatment, according to the Sumy City Council. While they succeeded in raising the necessary amount, Zhurba ultimately succumbed to his injuries. The 18 year-old&apos;s father was among the wounded and is currently being treated in the hospital. Ukraine&apos;s northern Sumy Oblast, bordering Russia, is a frequent target of Russian strikes. Children of all ages are often among the victims of Moscow&apos;s nationwide attacks.Overnight, Russia targeted Ukraine&apos;s central Poltava Oblast, killing at least 14 people, including two children.	https://kyivindependent.com/city-council-18-year-old-injured-in-jan-30-attack-on-sumy-dies/	2025-02-02T05:19:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/475521295_1053949616763279_2119158003595389289_n.jpg
15,000 Russian troops 'neutralized' in Pokrovsk direction in January alone, Syrskyi says	Some 15,000 Russian soldiers were &quot;neutralized&quot; by Ukrainian forces in the Pokrovsk direction in Donetsk Oblast during January, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Feb. 2. In a post on Facebook that included a video of combat footage, Syrskyi said the area &quot;remains one of the hottest&quot; on the front, adding Ukrainian forces were &quot;continuously inflicting losses on the occupiers.&quot; &quot;In January of this year alone, our soldiers neutralized more than 15,000 invaders here, of which about 7,000 were killed,&quot; he added. 0:00/1&#xD7;The video released by Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi on Feb. 2 of combat in the Pokrovsk sector (Facebook)The Kyiv Independent could not verify the figures. A report from the monitoring group DeepState, published on Jan. 28 said that overall across the front lines, the intensity of Russian assaults was declining, but remains high. It added that Russian forces have concentrated 44% of their attacks in the Pokrovsk sector, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian troops in Donetsk Oblast. Russian forces were deploying small groups in an attempt to encircle Ukrainian troops in the sector, Viktor Trehubov, spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces, said on Jan. 27. The peak intensity of Russian offensive efforts across the front lines was recorded in the second half of December, following a surge in attacks that began in late November. According to data published by Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, 840,260 of Moscow&apos;s troops have been injured or killed since 2022. Russian losses in Ukraine are helping fuel a demographic timebomb that could see the country&#x2019;s population reduced by half by the end of the century, experts told the Kyiv Independent earlier this month.. &quot;The impact on Russian society is devastating,&quot; said Harley Balzer, emeritus professor of government and international affairs at Georgetown University. &quot;From Russia&apos;s perspective, (winning the war in Ukraine) is the smaller problem.

Putin will never try again after this' — NATO chief has 'secret' ideas for Ukraine peace talks	NATO Chief Mark Rutte has said he has ideas about any future peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow that are a &quot;little secret&quot; but will ensure Russian President Vladimir Putin will &quot;never try again&quot; to conquer Ukraine. In an interview with the German newspaper Bild published on Feb. 1, Rutte was asked if peace between the two countries was even possible. &quot;We must ensure that (Putin) can never, ever again conquer even one square kilometer of Ukraine,&quot; he replied, adding the most important thing for NATO to do right now is to support Kyiv with weapons and training for its soldiers. He went on to say that if Ukraine decides to enter peace talks, it will then have to bring Putin to the negotiating table. &quot;I can&apos;t describe to you exactly how these talks will go,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;I already have ideas about what this composition could look like. But we don&apos;t want to make Putin any smarter than he already is. &quot;We&apos;re making it a little secret. Only the end is certain &#x2014; Putin will never try again after this.&quot; Rutte did not elaborate further on his ideas. He was also asked during the interview about the direction of the full-scale invasion, and if Ukraine along with its Western allies were losing given Russia&apos;s continued grinding advances in the Donbas. &quot;The front is moving in the wrong direction. But at what price?,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;The Russians are paying for it with 1,000 to 1,500 people a day who are dying or seriously wounded. And yet the Russians are not achieving their goals. &quot;And our job is to ensure that they never achieve their goals. So no, Ukraine is not losing and we must support them in getting into a position of strength.&quot; The comments come a day after U.S. President Donald Trump said that his team is already engaged in &quot;very serious&quot; discussions with the Russian side on how to end the war in Ukraine. In response, President Volodymyr Zelensky told the AP that talks about the war that do not include Ukraine are &quot;very dangerous.&quot; &quot;They may have their own relations, but talking about Ukraine without us &#x2014; it is dangerous for everyone,&quot; Zelensky said Zelensky said that the first step for Ukraine is to hold a high-level meeting with Trump, so that Kyiv and Washington can develop their own plans for a ceasefire. Then the parties can move on to discussions that involve Russia. &quot;I believe that, first and foremost, we (must) hold a meeting with (Trump), and that is important. And that is, by the way, something that everyone in Europe wants,&quot; Zelensky said. Following the meeting, &quot;we should move on to some kind of format of conversation with Russians,&quot; he added. &quot;And I would like to see the United States of America, Ukraine, and the Russians at the negotiating table. ... And, to be honest, a European Union voice should also be there. I think it would be fair, effective. But how will it turn out I don&apos;t know.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-will-never-try-again-after-this-nato-chief-has-secret-ideas-for-ukraine-peace-talks/	2025-02-02T03:27:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2195873956.jpg
Russia blames Ukraine for deadly strike on Kursk boarding school, Air Force evidence suggests otherwise	Russia&apos;s Investigative Committee launched a &quot;terrorism&quot; probe on Feb. 2 against the commander of Ukraine&apos;s 19th Separate Missile Brigade over a deadly strike on a boarding school being used to shelter civilians in Sudzha, Kursk Oblast, which Ukraine says was carried out by Russia&apos;s military. At least four people were killed and 84 rescued after the attack on the evening of Feb. 1, which the General Staff says was carried out by Russia using a targeted guided aerial bomb strike. &quot;There is indisputable evidence and objective monitoring results showing that the strike was carried out by Russian tactical aviation,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Air Force wrote on Feb. 1, with screenshots published from the Virazh-Tablet system allegedly showing the flight path of the Russian guided aerial bomb. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claims that Ukraine carried out a missile attack from Sumy Oblast. It did not provide any evidence. The Kyiv Independent could not verify either of these claims. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack, writing on Feb. 1 that civilians in the residential facility were being evacuated to safety. Drawing parallels to Russia&apos;s 1990s wars in Chechnya that devastated cities and killed tens of thousands of civilians, he said: &quot;Even against their own civilians, the Russian army uses similar tactics.&quot; A series of apartment bombings occurred in cities across Russia during the late 1990s, which the Russian government blamed on Chechen militants and used as a pretext to escalate military action in Chechnya. In the lead-up to discussions about a potential negotiated ceasefire, Russia is attempting to frame Ukraine as the aggressor, even as it continues to launch daily attacks on Ukrainian cities. On Jan. 20, Russian state-controlled media claimed that they had discovered the bodies of civilians in the village of Russkoe Porechnoe in Kursk region that were &quot;executed&quot; by Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. The original news story, aired on Rossiya 1, didn&apos;t specify the number of people killed, and the soldier in the footage only mentions four bodies. Later, on Jan. 31, Rossiya 1 aired footage of what they claimed was a Ukrainian soldier &quot;confessing&quot; to taking part in the executions, and the number of civilians killed was suddenly listed as 22.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-russia-exchange-blame-over-strike-on-residential-facility-in-sudzha/	2025-02-02T03:05:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/475810408_1040127424821872_3107816189091721438_n.jpg
Woman in Russian-occupied Crimea fined for 'promoting child-free lifestyle'	A 29-year-old woman in Russian-occupied Sevastopol was fined 50,000 rubles ($500) for &quot;promoting the appeal of a child-free lifestyle&quot; on social media, local occupation authorities reported on Jan. 31. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law banning &quot;childfree propaganda&quot; in November last year, equating it to the promotion of &quot;non-traditional sexual relations.&quot; When Putin came to power in 1999, Russia&#x2019;s fertility rate stood at 1.18 children per woman, according to data collected by the U.N. It peaked at 1.79 in 2015 but declined to 1.46 in 2024, with the country facing a &quot;devastating&quot; demographic crisis, experts say. According to the local occupation authorities, the woman had been posting &quot;misanthropic content&quot; on her VKontakte social media account and allegedly did not remove it after the law came into effect. Screenshots allegedly from her account, included in the local occupation authorities&apos; Telegram post, show a meme featuring American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino alongside the quote: &quot;Making movies, not babies&#x2014;that&#x2019;s my motto.&quot; The other two screenshots depict characters from TV shows and films flipping the middle finger &#x2014; both have the dates and times of the posts blurred out. Legal experts cited by independent Russian news outlet Agentsvo confirmed that this is the first recorded fine under Russia&#x2019;s &#x201C;childfree propaganda&#x201D; law. They warned the case could set a troubling precedent, potentially leading to fines for other non-criminal expressions, such as women speaking about the challenges of motherhood. Ukraine&apos;s Crimean Peninsula has been under Russian occupation since 2014, when Moscow seized it following a widely condemned referendum. The report from local occupation authorities does not clarify whether the woman was a Ukrainian resident of Sevastopol before the annexation, but Ukrainian citizens are frequently targeted by the occupying authorities. Russia&apos;s controversial law banning so-called &quot;child-free propaganda&quot; also prohibits the adoption of Russian children by nationals from countries where gender transition surgeries are legal. While Russia faces a looming demographic crisis, the names of nearly 89,000 thousand soldiers killed fighting in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine have been identified by independent Russian media. According to data published by Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, 840,260 of Moscow&apos;s troops have been injured or killed since 2022. Russian losses in Ukraine are helping fuel a demographic timebomb that could see the country&#x2019;s population reduced by half by the end of the century, experts told the Kyiv Independent earlier this month.. &quot;The impact on Russian society is devastating,&quot; said Harley Balzer, emeritus professor of government and international affairs at Georgetown University. &quot;From Russia&apos;s perspective, (winning the war in Ukraine) is the smaller problem.

Massive fire breaks out at Kharkiv warehouse after Russian drone attack	A large-scale fire broke out at a warehouse in Kharkiv after a Russian drone struck a civilian enterprise late at night on Feb. 1, Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service reported. Russia launched a drone attack against the city&apos;s Slobidskyi district, causing a massive fire in a production and warehouse facility. The fire spread over an area of 2,000 meters, the State Emergency Service said. Firefighters contained the blaze at 1:27 a.m. local time on Feb. 2. The warehouse was part of a civilian enterprise, according to authorities. No casualties have been reported. Located less than 30 kilometers from the Russian border, the northeastern city of Kharkiv has suffered relentless aerial attacks over the past two years of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Moscow often targets densely populated neighborhoods and civilian infrastructure with missiles, drones, and glide bombs.	https://kyivindependent.com/massive-fire-breaks-out-at-kharkiv-warehouse-after-russian-drone-attack/	2025-02-01T21:14:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/fire.jpg
They killed Syrians the same way' — Zelensky condemns alleged Russian strike on civilians in Kursk Oblast	President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned Russia&apos;s alleged bombing of a nursing home in Kursk Oblast, comparing the attack to Russian warfare in Chechnya, Syria, and Ukraine. The presidents comments come after the Ukrainian military reported a Russian airstrike on a residential facility in the Ukrainian-occupied town of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast on Feb. 1. The attack killed at least four people and critically wounded four others. &quot;This is how Russia waged war against Chechnya decades ago,&quot; Zelensky wrote on X. &quot;They killed Syrians the same way. Russian bombs destroy Ukrainian homes the same way. And even against their own civilians, the Russian army uses similar tactics.&quot; The targeted building, which served as a shelter, primarily housed elderly residents. Over 80 people were evacuated from the building in the aftermath of the attack. The Ukrainian military said that Russia launched a KAB aerial guided bomb at the site, which they claim was previously targeted by Russian forces in an attack on Jan. 11. The Russian Defense Ministry later on Feb. 1 accused Ukraine of the bombing. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force published screenshots from the Virage Tablet system purporting to show the trajectory of the Russian bomb. The system is an automated software program the military uses to track aerial threats. &quot;This is a state devoid of civility,&quot; Zelensky wrote. &quot;And this is an evil that will not stop on its own.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s remarks refer to Russia&apos;s brutal military campaigns against Chechnya in the 1990s and early 2000s, and Russia&apos;s support for former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, now in exile in Moscow. With Russia&apos;s military backing, Assad&apos;s regime imprisoned, tortured, and killed hundreds of thousands of Syrians during its crackdown on opposition forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/they-killed-syrians-the-same-way-zelensky-condemns-alleged-russian-strike-on-civilians-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-02-01T19:28:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/zel.jpeg
No unit named Georgian Legion' in our agency — Ukraine's military intelligence hits back at Slovakia's coup accusations	Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) dismissed claims by Slovak officials that HUR had orchestrated an attempted coup in Bratislava using members of the volunteer-based Georgian Legion. &quot;The Defense Intelligence of Ukraine officially reports that there is no unit called the Georgian National Legion in its structure,&quot; the agency said in a statement on Feb. 1. The statement comes after Slovakia banned Georgian Legion commander Mamuka Mamulashvili from entering the country amid allegations that his unit was connected to a coup plot. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico claimed on Jan. 31 Mamulashvili helped organize mass protests in Slovakia on behalf of Ukraine as part of a hybrid operation against his government. He did not explain how Mamulashvili organized the demonstrations or plotted a coup but said the commander was &quot;subordinate&quot; to HUR. Fico also claimed that the Peace for Ukraine initiative, a group that has helped mobilize the recent protests, had financed the Georgian Legion&apos;s attempts to overthrow the government. HUR &quot;strongly rejects false accusations of organizing illegal actions in the Slovak Republic,&quot; the agency&apos;s statement said. Mamulashvili &quot;has no relation to Ukrainian intelligence, and does not receive any tasks or instructions from the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine. This person terminated his contract with the International Legion of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine in April 2023 and did not renew it,&quot; HUR said. The Georgian Legion is a volunteer unit that has been fighting in Ukraine &#xA0;since 2014. Mamulashvili established the unit to combat Russian forces in eastern Ukraine. Fico&apos;s accusations come at a time of heightened tensions between Kyiv and Bratislava. The termination of Russian gas transit via Ukrainian territory on Jan. 1 triggered retaliatory threats from Fico&apos;s Kremlin-friendly government, and Fico has reportedly criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky for supporting the protests in Slovakia. The demonstrations, held under the slogan &quot;Slovakia is Europe,&quot; swept across 30 cities on Jan. 24. Around 100,000 people nationwide chanted slogans like &quot;Enough of Fico&quot; and &quot;We are Europe,&quot; voicing opposition to the prime minister&apos;s pro-Russian stance.	https://kyivindependent.com/no-unit-named-georgian-legion-in-our-agency-ukraines-military-intelligence-hits-back-at-slovakias-coup-accusations/	2025-02-01T17:47:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1691800076.jpg
US, EU should be part of Ukraine-Russia peace talks, Zelensky says	The United States and the European Union should join Ukraine and Russia at the negotiating table in future peace talks, President Volodymyr Zelensky told the Associated Press (AP) in an interview published Feb. 1.

But how will it turn out I don&apos;t know.&quot; Zelensky told the AP that Moscow is not interested in holding peace talks due to their advantage on the battlefield, but that Trump could force Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate by threatening harsher sanctions against Russia. The U.S. should also continue supplying weapons to Kyiv, he said. &quot;I think these are the closest and most important steps.&quot; The president also addressed comments by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said on Jan. 30 that the war has set Ukraine &quot;back 100 years.&quot; Rubio &quot;needs to come to Ukraine, first of all, to see what Russia has done,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;But also to see what the Ukrainian people did, what they were able to do for the security of Ukraine and the world, as I said, and just talk to these people.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-eu-should-be-part-of-ukraine-russia-peace-talks-zelensky-says/	2025-02-01T17:00:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167462835.jpg
Trump launches trade war with steep tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico	U.S. President Donald Trump signed executive orders on Feb. 1 imposing steep tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, potentially triggering a trade war between the U.S. and its largest economic partners. The orders placed 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods, with only a 10% tariff on Canadian energy imports. Trump imposed a 10% tariff on goods from China. Trump promised throughout his campaign to use tariffs to pressure foreign countries, threatening traditional allies as well as adversaries. The day before the executive orders, Trump threatened to enact &quot;100% tariffs&quot; on BRICS countries if they attempted to supercede the U.S. dollar in international trade. Trump also threatened to use tariffs to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. The tariffs against China, Mexico, and Canada were imposed before any negotiations between the U.S. and those countries, according to the New York Times. The first two weeks of Trump&apos;s second term in office have been characterized by a whirlwind of executive orders that have caused domestic and international shockwaves. The administration has frozen foreign aid, cracked down on migrants, and enacted sweeping purges of the federal government. The stoppage of foreign aid has impacted vital organizations in Ukraine, including independent media and groups working to restore the country&apos;s battered energy infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-launches-trade-war-with-steep-tariffs-on-china-canada-mexico/	2025-02-01T16:09:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2196787795.jpg
Ukraine's NATO membership 'cheapest' security guarantee, 'victory' for Trump, Zelensky tells AP	NATO membership is the &quot;cheapest&quot; possible security guarantee for Ukraine and a chance for U.S. President Donald Trump to score a geopolitical victory over Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with the Associated Press (AP) on Feb. 1. The question of Kyiv&apos;s future accession to the Alliance is likely a key point of contention in the expected Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations, which Trump has pledged to initiate within the next few months. NATO membership is the best possible security guarantee for Ukraine and the &quot;cheapest&quot; option for Western allies, Zelensky told the AP. &quot;I really believe that these are the cheapest security guarantees that Ukraine can get, the cheapest for everyone,&quot; he said. &quot;It will be a signal that it is not for Russia to decide who should be in NATO and who should not, but for the United States of America to decide. I think this is a great victory for Trump.&quot; Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022 following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. While NATO members asserted at the 2024 summit in Washington, D.C. that Ukraine&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; they have yet to extend a formal invitation. Russian propaganda narratives frequently cite Ukraine&apos;s potential NATO membership as a justification for the invasion. Trump himself has echoed this talking point, saying that former President Joe Biden&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations provoked the full-scale war. &quot;That&apos;s been like written in stone,&quot; Trump said on Jan. 7, referring to Russia&apos;s opposition to Ukraine joining the Alliance. &quot;And Biden said, &apos;No, they should be able to join NATO.&apos; Then Russia has somebody right on their doorstep. I could understand (Russia&apos;s) feelings about that.&quot; Moscow has said that a ban on Ukraine&apos;s entry to NATO is a key condition of any ceasefire agreement. Ukrainian officials, including Zelensky, have disputed Trump&apos;s narrative and dismissed Russia&apos;s demands. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry called Russia&apos;s proposed ban &quot;utter bul***it&quot; in a Jan. 24 statement. Zelensky told the AP that Ukraine&apos;s accession to the Alliance would be mutually beneficial to Kyiv and to member states. The addition of Ukrainian defense forces would also be an asset to NATO, potentially allowing the U.S. to withdraw its troops stationed overseas. French President Emmanuel Macron&apos;s proposal to deploy European peacekeepers to Ukraine to monitor a ceasefire is also being discussed, Zelensky said. Questions remain as to its feasability, and it would have to be backed by other security measures. &quot;That&apos;s not enough,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Imagine, there is a contingent. The question is who is in charge? Who is the main one? What will they do if there are Russian strikes? Missiles, disembarkation, attack from the sea, crossing of the land borderline, offensive. What will they do? What are their mandates?&quot; Macron and Zelensky are &quot;still in the process of this dialogue,&quot; the president said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-nato-membership-cheapest-security-guarantee-victory-for-trump-zelensky-tells-ap/	2025-02-01T15:26:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/GettyImages-2193463528.jpg
Russia’s new naval base raises fears of Georgia’s involvement in Ukraine war, WSJ reports	Russia is building a new naval base in Ochamchire, Abkhazia, a move that raises fears Georgia could be drawn into the war in Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reports. The base is part of Moscow&#x2019;s strategy to safeguard its naval forces after suffering heavy losses in the Black Sea. Since launching its full-scale invasion in 2022, Russia has lost or sustained damage to roughly a third of its fleet in the region. Satellite images obtained by the outlet show continued upgrades at the Ochamchira port, including expanded access points to fit larger vessels. Though relatively small, experts say the facility could host ships equipped with cruise missiles, bolstering Russia&#x2019;s military presence in the Black Sea. Ochamchire, more than 700 kilometers southeast of the nearest Ukrainian-controlled territory, could provide Moscow with a naval base that remains largely beyond the range of Ukraine&#x2019;s existing long-range strikes. Russia has occupied Abkhazia after a war with Tbilisi in 2008, backing local breakaway leadership. The region is internationally recognized as Georgia&apos;s sovereign soil. The Wall Street Journal reports that if Ukraine were to target Russian warships there, Georgia could find itself pulled into the war. Beyond military risks, the base threatens a key trade route between Asia and Europe. Before Russia&#x2019;s invasion, more than 85% of land-based trade between China and Europe moved through Russian territory. Sanctions have disrupted that route, shifting attention to the Middle Corridor, which runs through Georgia. The World Bank estimates this corridor could handle 11 million tonnes of cargo annually by 2030, up from less than 3 million tonnes in 2023. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-new-naval-base-raises-fears-of-georgias-involvement-in-ukraine-war-wsj-reports/	2025-02-01T12:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1241355624--2--1.jpg
Russia strikes nursing home in Kursk region's Sudzha, Ukraine's General Staff reports	A Russian strike targeted a nursing home in the Ukrainian-captured town of Sudzha in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast on Feb. 1, according to Ukraine&apos;s military. The building, which served as a shelter, primarily housed elderly residents. Nearly 95 people were said to be trapped under the rubble. The Kyiv Independent can&apos;t immediately verify the claims. &quot;At the time of the attack, dozens of local residents were inside the building preparing to evacuate,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said. &quot;The Russians knew that the building housed mainly civilians - local residents, including women and children. Everything possible is being done to rescue the survivors.&quot; &#x421;&#x44C;&#x43E;&#x433;&#x43E;&#x434;&#x43D;&#x456;, 1 &#x43B;&#x44E;&#x442;&#x43E;&#x433;&#x43E;, &#x43E; 16:54 &#x440;&#x43E;&#x441;&#x456;&#x439;&#x441;&#x44C;&#x43A;&#x430; &#x430;&#x432;&#x456;&#x430;&#x446;&#x456;&#x44F; &#x437;&#x430;&#x432;&#x434;&#x430;&#x43B;&#x430; &#x443;&#x434;&#x430;&#x440;&#x443; &#x43A;&#x435;&#x440;&#x43E;&#x432;&#x430;&#x43D;&#x43E;&#x44E; &#x430;&#x432;&#x456;&#x430;&#x446;&#x456;&#x439;&#x43D;&#x43E;&#x44E; &#x431;&#x43E;&#x43C;&#x431;&#x43E;&#x44E; (&#x41A;&#x410;&#x411;) &#x43F;&#x43E; &#x456;&#x43D;&#x442;&#x435;&#x440;&#x43D;&#x430;&#x442;&#x443; &#x432; &#x43C;&#x456;&#x441;&#x442;&#x456; &#x421;&#x443;&#x434;&#x436;&#x430; &#x41A;&#x443;&#x440;&#x441;&#x44C;&#x43A;&#x43E;&#x457; &#x43E;&#x431;&#x43B;&#x430;&#x441;&#x442;&#x456;. &#x423;&#x434;&#x430;&#x440;&#x443; &#x437;&#x430;&#x432;&#x434;&#x430;&#x43D;&#x43E; &#x446;&#x456;&#x43B;&#x435;&#x441;&#x43F;&#x440;&#x44F;&#x43C;&#x43E;&#x432;&#x430;&#x43D;&#x43E;.&#x414;&#x43E;&#x43A;&#x43B;&#x430;&#x434;&#x43D;&#x456;&#x448;&#x435;: https://t.co/PCtQnMEw8q pic.twitter.com/J7RFO29H7Z Officials have yet to confirm casualties, but emergency crews have been dispatched to the scene.

Russian independent media uses Ukrainian war victim in ad campaign, sparking outrage	Russian independent news outlet Meduza used a photo of a Ukrainian man mourning his family killed in a Russian strike to bolster its European promo campaign &#x2014;&#xA0;without his permission, he told the Kyiv Independent. The photo is of Yaroslav Bazylevych, whose entire family was killed when a Russian missile hit their apartment building on Sept. 4 in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. Meduza used the man&apos;s photo from his family&apos;s funeral, as well as other pictures of Ukrainian war victims in a promotional video as part of the campaign, first published over two months ago. Bazylevych told the Kyiv Independent he considered the use of his photo &quot;unacceptable.&quot; The campaign &#x2014; which uses images of Russian atrocities in Ukraine to promote a Russian media outlet &#x2014; has been met with swift criticism in Ukraine, by both officials and the public. &quot;Exploiting our tragedy to evoke sympathy for Russians is a complete disgrace,&quot; said Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry in a statement. &quot;We demand that all such promo content exploiting Ukrainian suffering caused by Russian terror be removed immediately from all media platforms where it has appeared,&quot; said Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi. In a press-release on their English-language website, Meduza said that the video is meant for &quot;bolstering Meduza&#x2019;s crowdfunding efforts&quot; and asked their audience to share it. It was also screened across European capitals in a widespread promotional campaign titled &quot;Where other headlines end, Meduza begins.&quot; The video was developed pro-bono by a Berlin-based creative agency Lure. As of Feb. 1, the agency used Bazylevych&apos;s photo as a title picture for the campaign on their website, with the title &quot;Meduza&quot; posted across his wounded face. Meduza did not publicly state who financed the campaign or where the funds to support it originate from. At the time of publication, Meduza had not responded to the Kyiv Independent&apos;s request for comment. Yaroslav Bazylevych&apos;s photo from the funeral of his family, killed in a Russian strike, on the Lure agency&apos;s website that developed a promo campaign for a Russian media outlet Meduza. (Lure / Official website)Bazylevych said that no one contacted him to ask for permission to use his pictures from either Meduza or Lure Agency, despite the agency&apos;s claim that they conducted &quot;meticulous research&quot; to design the campaign. His 7-year-old daughter Emilia, 18-year-old Daryna and 21-year-old Yaryna were killed together with his wife Yevhenia, 43, as they were making their way to a bomb shelter. Bazylevych was lightly wounded in the attack. &quot;I consider it unacceptable for their advertising campaign,&quot; Bazylevych told the Kyiv Independent over the text. Bazylevych confirmed over text that he plans to pursue legal action to stop the use of this ad campaign. Kevin Rothrock, Meduza&apos;s English version&apos;s managing editor, told the Kyiv Independent that he wasn&apos;t aware of the campaign. Meduza is an independent Russian media outlet that was founded in 2014 outside of Russia, with its headquarters in Riga, Latvia. It has been banned in Russia since 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-media-uses-ukrainian-war-victim-in-ad-campaign-sparking-outrage/	2025-02-01T10:27:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2174646190.jpg
US urges Ukraine to hold elections after ceasefire, Reuters reports	The United States is urging Ukraine to hold elections, possibly by the end of the year, particularly if a truce with Russia is reached in the coming months, according to President Donald Trump&apos;s top Ukraine official. Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, told Reuters that presidential and parliamentary elections, suspended since the all-out war began, &quot;need to be done.&quot; He argued that most democratic nations hold elections during wartime and that doing so would strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s democracy. &quot;That&#x2019;s the beauty of a solid democracy, you have more than one person potentially running,&quot; Kellogg said. Trump and Kellogg have indicated they are working on a plan to broker a peace deal within the first months of the new administration, though details remain scarce. While the strategy is still being developed, two sources familiar with White House discussions and a former U.S. official briefed on the matter said Trump officials are considering pushing Ukraine to hold elections as part of an initial ceasefire with Russia. The administration is also debating whether to secure a temporary ceasefire before negotiating a more permanent resolution, with the election winner potentially overseeing future talks with Moscow. The response from Kyiv to such a proposal remains uncertain, according to Reuters. President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that elections could take place if fighting ends and security guarantees are in place to prevent renewed Russian aggression. However, a senior adviser to the Ukrainian government and another official said that the Trump administration has not yet made a formal request for elections by year&#x2019;s end. Ukrainian law currently prohibits elections under martial law, which has been in effect since February 2022. Washington previously raised the issue of elections with Ukrainian officials in both 2023 and 2024 during Joe Biden&#x2019;s presidency, according to two former senior U.S. officials. U.S. diplomats emphasized the importance of elections for democratic legitimacy, but Ukrainian officials resisted, arguing that elections during wartime could create internal divisions and expose Ukraine to Russian disinformation campaigns. The Kremlin has questioned the absence of elections, with Russian President Vladimir Putin insisting that the Ukrainian leader lacks the legal authority to sign binding agreements. However, Putin has said Zelensky could still take part in negotiations if he first repeals a 2022 decree that bans talks with Russia while Putin remains in power. The former Western official familiar with the U.S. proposal expressed concerns that lifting martial law for elections could destabilize Ukraine by allowing mobilized soldiers to leave the military, triggering financial instability, and prompting draft-age men to flee the country. If Trump pressures Ukraine to hold elections, the former Western official warned, the U.S. could be aligning with Russian narratives. &quot;Trump is reacting, in my view, to ... Russian feedback,&quot; the official said. Russia wants to see an end to Zelensky.&quot; Some former U.S. officials doubt that a peace deal will be reached in the coming months or that elections will take place in 2025, given the lack of consensus on how to start formal negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-urges-ukraine-to-hold-elections-after-ceasefire-trumps-envoy-tells-reuters/	2025-02-01T09:05:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1242112336.jpg
Kidnapped Belarusian soldier fighting for Ukraine paraded on Belarusian state-controlled television	Branded a terrorist by Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime for taking part in Ukraine&#x2019;s fight against Russia, Vasyl Verameichyk was paraded on state-controlled television in late January for a two-part interview titled &quot;Confessions of a Militant.&quot; During the so-called interview, Verameichyk spoke of plans for an alleged incursion into Belarus, similar to the Ukrainian military&apos;s operation in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. Verameichyk also acknowledged some of the challenges he faced during his military service in Ukraine, which Belarusian state-controlled television tried to distort and use to portray Ukrainian military life as rife with drug abuse, corruption, and a pervasive fear of death by the hands of one&#x2019;s own fellow soldiers. After being arrested in Vietnam in November, Verameichyk was swiftly extradited to Belarus. It is believed that he was targeted in a coordinated operation by Lukashenko&#x2019;s security services for having served in the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment of Belarusian volunteers fighting for Ukraine. &#x201C;It seems to me that the regime is using all of this for the domestic audience. They need to create the impression that everything around them is chaos, war, and destruction &#x2014; that only Lukashenko can &#x2018;save&#x2019; them,&#x201D; volunteer and journalist Maria Malyavko, a longtime friend of Verameichyk, told the Kyiv Independent. Belarusian volunteers in Ukraine have been attempting to rally Kyiv to help facilitate Verameichyk&#x2019;s freedom. While Malyavko and others who know Verameichyk were relieved to see new footage of him being alive, their relief is tempered by the harsh reality that as long as Verameichyk remains in Belarusian custody, his life and health remain at risk. The Belarusian regime&apos;s media frenzy focused primarily on the revelation of a supposed plan for the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment, assisted by Ukrainian and other European intelligence services, to launch an offensive and seize part of Belarusian territory &#x2014; mirroring Ukraine&apos;s ongoing actions in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. Verameichyk&#x2019;s time serving in the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment was reportedly cut short by a dispute with a staff officer that temporarily prevented him from reentering Ukraine, although those who served alongside him said he was looking for ways to return to the front. &#x201C;I am aware of the existence of a classified part of the strategy for the liberation of Belarus &#x2014; secret protocols that outline specific actions and possible scenarios,&#x201D; Verameichyk told the state propagandist conducting the interview. &#x201C;This is a set of measures developed with the assistance of serious organizations, Western intelligence agencies, the intelligence services of Lithuania, Poland, and, of course, the SBU, aimed at using armed force to seize a certain territory of Belarus.&#x201D; Specifically, Verameichyk pointed to the border town of Malaryta, situated in Belarus&#x2019; western Brest region near the borders of Poland and Ukraine. For some Belarusian exiles who watched the interview, this only added to the spectacle. &#x201C;Vasyl didn&#x2019;t say anything unexpected for us, except for the &#x2018;plans to capture Malaryta,&#x2019;&#x2019;&#x201D; Malyavko said. Vasil Verameichyk, a former fighter of the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment, was detained in Vietnam and extradited to Belarus in Minsk, Belarus, on Oct. 20, 2024. (Screenshot from ONT video)&#x201C;This topic has been so meme-worthy for a long time that it sounded more like mocking the Belarusian regime, who are going through a severe creative crisis.&#x201D; The bizarre tone of the interview was further marked by mentions of foreign fighters supporting the regiment in its alleged incursion into Belarus. Both the Belarusian and Russian governments regularly label foreign fighters in Ukraine as &quot;mercenaries,&quot; a narrative spread through state-controlled media to reinforce the claim that the West aims to destabilize their so-called region of interest. Propagandists also pressed Verameichyk on internal conflicts within the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment, pointing to drug use, though Veremeychyk only acknowledged alcohol and marijuana consumption among some of those serving in the regiment. He further discussed the disconnect between the staff based in Kyiv and those serving on the front lines &#x2014; an issue that is not unique to the regiment but has been observed across the military as a whole. Verameichuk was also asked about the medal he was awarded by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence for his role in coordinating the evacuation of more than 60 Ukrainian soldiers from encirclement near Oleksandrivka in Ukraine&#x2019;s southern Mykolaiv Oblast. He replied that while he never wore the medal, he accepted it &quot;with pride,&quot; a reply that Belarusian state-controlled television characterized as his attempt to &quot;distance&quot; himself from the honor. The Kastus Kalinouski Regiment didn&#x2019;t respond to the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s request for comment on what was said by Verameichyk, only clarifying that &#x201C;a person who is effectively being held hostage by Lukashenko&#x2019;s authorities may and will say whatever is demanded of them.&#x201D; Although Belarus has not officially joined the full-scale war, it actively supports Russia by serving as a strategic hub for Russian military operations. As a result, Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime has designated the soldiers serving in the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment as members of a terrorist organization. At the end of the state propaganda film showcasing the capture of Verameichyk in November, the head of Belarus&#x2019; security service declared to the camera that Belarusians fighting alongside Ukraine &quot;should live with the knowledge that Belarus will find them, no matter where they are in the world.&quot; Those who know Verameichyk and served alongside him emphasize that, as a captive of Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime, he was essentially forced to perform for the camera. &#x201C;The interview turned out to be quite soft. Most of the information had already been mentioned by other Belarusian volunteers in opposition media,&#x201D; Andrei Kushnerau, a Belarusian soldier who is currently serving in the Da Vinci&#x2019;s Wolves battalion, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Vasyl handled himself very well, especially considering that he is in captivity.&#x201D; &#x201C;Such &#x2018;interviews&#x2019; are typically watched to read between the lines, to observe how the person comes across, since there&apos;s no other connection &#x2014; it has to be done consciously and with a clear mind,&#x201D; Malyavko added. Kushnerau, alongside other Belarusian volunteers, has been actively lobbying Kyiv to facilitate a prisoner exchange with Minsk aimed at securing the release of Verameichyk, given that the regime&apos;s targeted campaign against him stems from his role in the fight for Ukraine&#x2019;s freedom.

(Sergei Supinsky / AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;However, the Ukrainian side has still done nothing to help the person who fought for its freedom,&#x201D; Kushnerau said. The President&#x2019;s Office did not respond to the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s request for comment. While the timeline for securing Verameichyk&apos;s freedom remains uncertain, his friends and fellow soldiers refuse to give up. Instead, they continue to amplify his case, steadfast in their resolve to ensure his plight is not forgotten, holding onto hope that they&#x2019;ll see him again, however elusive it may sometimes seem. &#x201C;In connection with Vasily&apos;s story, I feel like speaking out and shouting: have respect for soldiers!&#x201D; Malyavko said. &#x201C;These are people who take on enormous burdens at the front, and we must carry their burden in civilian life. Unfortunately, we are so far away that we can&#x2019;t help him (directly). And now, almost a miracle is needed to make it possible.&#x201D; Hi, this is Kate Tsurkan. Thank you for taking the time to read this article. The Belarusian people&apos;s struggle for a better future is ongoing, especially as the Lukashenko regime continues to target innocent individuals. We must also remember amid all this the many Belarusian soldiers risking their lives to defend Ukraine against Russian aggression &#x2014; they don&apos;t get enough coverage but deserve our recognition and support.

Poland scrambles jets, puts air defense on high alert during Russian missile attack on Ukraine	Polish and other allied aircraft were quickly mobilized on Feb. 1 in response to a large-scale missile attack by Russia on western Ukraine, Poland&apos;s Armed Forces reported on X. &quot;Attention, due to the attack of the Russian Federation performing strikes on facilities located in the west of Ukraine, among others, the operation of Polish and allied aviation in our airspace has begun,&#x201D; the statement said. All available forces and means were activated during the attack, the command said, adding that it was constantly monitoring the situation. In accordance with procedures, fighter jets were dispatched, and ground-based air defense and radar reconnaissance assets were put on high alert, the Polish military said. Russia launched a combined attack of 165 &#xA0;unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and missiles at Ukraine overnight and in the morning on Feb. 1, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported. Ukrainian air defense intercepted 56 Russian UAVs, the Air Force said. At least seven people were killed and 14 injured in a residential building strike in Poltava. Civilian entreprises and infrastructure in Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, Sumy, Kharkiv, Khmelnytsky, and Kyiv oblasts were damaged, according to the report. Poland has scrambled jets amid Russian attacks on Ukraine several times over the past year.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-scrambles-jets-alerts-air-defense-during-russian-missile-attack/	2025-02-01T06:30:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1601919862.jpg
Emergency power cuts temporarily introduced across Ukraine after Russian missile attack	Emergency power outages were introduced temporarily in seven Ukrainian oblasts on Feb. 1 following a Russian missile attack to prevent the collapse the energy system. The restrictions were applied in Kharkiv, Sumy, Poltava, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, according to Ukraine&apos;s state grid operator Ukrenergo. Three hours later, Ukrenergo announced that restrictions were lifted across the country. &quot;The enemy continues its energy terror,&quot; said Ukraine&apos;s Energy Minister Herman Halushenko in response to the attacks. Earlier on Feb. 1, Poltava Regional Administration reported damage to energy infrastructure in the Myrhorod district. Several hours later, the administration reported that the energy supply was restored in the district. There have been two massive Russian attacks on energy infrastructure over the past month, as well as frequent smaller attacks, but because of the warm weather, the Ukrainian energy grid was able to operate without scheduled blackouts. The outages on Feb. 1 was the second time this year when Ukraine had to introduce emergency power cuts across several oblasts due to the damage of the power system and threat of its collapse after the Russian attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/emergency-power-cuts-introduced-across-ukraine-after-russian-attack/	2025-02-01T04:56:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1247620452.jpg
Man detained after allegedly killing draft officer in Ukraine's Poltava Oblast	The Poltava Oblast National Police detained a man who allegedly shot a draft officer, stole his weapon, and escaped with another man overnight on Jan. 31. The armed attack happened at a fuel station near Pyriatyn during the escort of conscripts to the 199th training center, the Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces said on Feb. 1. According to a Ground Forces statement, an unidentified man wearing a gray balaclava and military pants approached a serviceman of the Poltava draft office, threatening him with a hunting rifle and demanding that he hand over his weapon. &quot;When he refused, the man shot the soldier. The soldier died on the spot as a result of a serious injury,&quot; the statement said. The attacker seized the soldier&apos;s assault rifle and fled with one of the mobilized conscripts after the attack. Within a few hours of search operations, the police established the location of the attackers, according to a statement by the Poltava Oblast National Police. The man who allegedly shot the soldier was detained, and investigators seized his weapon, the report said. It also specified the shooter was a resident of Poltava region born in 1984. His accomplice was a resident of Poltava born in 1988. Police detained a man who allegedly killed a draft officer in Poltava Oblast on Jan. 31, 2025. (Poltava National Police / Official website)The prosecutor&apos;s office said it had launched a criminal investigation. &quot;The Ground Forces Command strongly condemns the armed attack on the serviceman of the Poltava Regional conscription office and demands a prompt investigation of this crime and severe punishment for the perpetrators,&quot; the Ground Forces wrote in their initial statement. Ukraine has long struggled with manpower shortages on the front to compensate for losses and the need to rotate soldiers who have been on fighting since the start of the full-scale invasion. Corrupt schemes uncovered throughout the full-scale invasion helping men avoid service have added to the difficulty of shoring up more soldiers for the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/man-was-detained-after-allegedly-killing-a-draft-officer-helping-another-man-escape/	2025-02-01T04:41:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/02/natpolice2.jpg

Moldova to provide temporary gas loan to Transnistria following Russian supply halt	Moldova will supply 3 million cubic meters of gas to the Russian-occupied Transnistria region on February 1, under an agreement signed earlier in the week, Reuters reported. Moldovagaz head Vadim Cheban stated that the gas will be delivered as a loan, which must be repaid by March 1, 2025. Transnistria&#x2019;s leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky, described the supply as &quot;technical assistance,&quot; emphasizing that it is intended to maintain pipeline pressure rather than provide heating for residents. He also accused Chisinau of delaying the arrival of EU-funded gas and urged the European Commission president to intervene. Meanwhile, Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean announced an EU financial aid package of 64 million euros ($66.3 million) to address the energy crisis, with 20 million euros ($20.7 million) of the package allocated for gas supplies to Transnistria. Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom halted gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1 as Ukraine ended Russian gas transit through its territory. Gazprom claimed that it halted supplies because of Moldova&apos;s alleged unpaid debts rather than transit issues. The gas suspension has led to widespread power outages in Transnistria, pushing the region toward industrial collapse. The Russian-held region is dependent on Russian supplies while the rest of the country pivoted toward European sellers.	https://kyivindependent.com/moldova-to-provide-temporary-gas-loan-to-transnistria-following-russian-supply-halt/	2025-01-31T21:07:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-2043797379.jpg
AI-powered drone company to assist in demining Ukrainian farmlands	AI company Safe Pro Group has signed a multi-year agreement with Ukrainian agricultural company Nibulon to deploy AI-powered drones for detecting landmines in farmland, BusinessWire reported on Jan. 31. Ukraine&#x2019;s Ministry of Economy estimates that over 139,300 square kilometers of land are potentially contaminated with explosives from the ongoing war, with clearance efforts expected to take over a decade and cost $35 billion. The partnership will use Safe Pro&#x2019;s SpotlightAI platform, hosted on Amazon Web Services, to survey affected farmland more efficiently. War-related farmland abandonment has already led to $2 billion in lost crops. Safe Pro&#x2019;s AI has processed over 931,000 drone images, identifying more than 18,000 explosive remnants across 10,500 acres, significantly speeding up mine detection. Nibulon, headquartered in Mykolaiv, stands as the sole company in the country&apos;s agriculture sector equipped with a proprietary fleet and shipyard. Specializing in the export of grains like wheat, barley, and corn, Nibulon is a prominent player in the industry. Ukraine remains the world&#x2019;s most mined country.	https://kyivindependent.com/ai-powered-drone-company-to-assist-in-demining-ukrainian-farmlands/	2025-01-31T19:53:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1251947486.jpeg
Lithuania's president calls for Ukraine's involvement in peace talks, stronger regional defense against Russia, AP reports	Lithuania&#x2019;s President Gitanas Nauseda emphasized the necessity of Ukraine&#x2019;s full involvement in peace negotiations and increased defense spending by regional countries to prevent future Russian aggression. In an interview with the Associated Press, Nauseda warned that a peace settlement without proper deterrents would allow Russia to consolidate its forces and prepare for further military action.&quot;You cannot believe that the intentions of Russia will be just to stop and do nothing,&quot; he said, stressing that any ceasefire would provide Russia a break to rebuild its military capabilities. Nauseda also raised concerns about potential Russian targets, including Ukraine and the Baltic countries, should the war reach a ceasefire. Lithuania, a country with a history of Soviet occupation until 1990, faces ongoing fears of Russian aggression. Its geographical position, bordering Russia&#x2019;s Kaliningrad exclave and Moscow&#x2019;s ally Belarus, makes Lithuania vulnerable to further conflict. Nauseda explained that, even after a potential resolution to the war in Ukraine, Lithuania will remain exposed to threats from Russia for the foreseeable future. &quot;You always have the threat from the East, and you must be aware and take all the necessary precautionary measures in order not to be attacked,&quot; he cautioned. Lithuania recently committed to increasing its defense spending to at least 5% of its GDP, following a push from U.S. President Donald Trump. This move contrasts with some NATO countries, which have resisted such a significant economic burden. Nevertheless, Lithuania sees this commitment as essential for its security. Nauseda echoed this sentiment, noting the need for his country to strengthen its defense capabilities in light of the ongoing conflict. &quot;This is an absolutely clear priority for this country, as a frontline country, that we have to spend more,&quot; he asserted. In the context of the war in Ukraine, Nauseda stressed the importance of including Kyiv in any peace talks. He declared it would be &quot;unacceptable if the peace would be set behind the doors and without the involvement of Ukraine,&quot; acknowledging the country&apos;s sacrifices in the war. He reiterated that Ukraine &quot;deserves the right to set the conditions of this peace.&quot; As concerns grow about the security of the Baltic region, Lithuania is also focused on the growing threat to its undersea infrastructure. Since October 2023, at least 11 Baltic cables have been damaged, sparking suspicion that the damage may be intentional. The most recent incident occurred when a fiber optic cable connecting Latvia and the Swedish island of Gotland ruptured. In response, NATO launched a mission called &quot;Baltic Sentry&quot; to protect vital underwater infrastructure. Nauseda called for increased maritime capabilities in the region, urging NATO and the EU to take stronger measures to prevent future incidents. &quot;It is time for us to show some muscle,&quot; he declared. Despite some objections within Lithuania regarding the rise in military spending, Nauseda argued that the country must take responsibility for its defense. While Lithuania can rely on NATO allies, the president emphasized that it would be naive to assume others would prioritize the country&apos;s security if it failed to demonstrate the ability to protect itself.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuanias-president-calls-for-ukraines-involvement-in-peace-talks-stronger-regional-defense-against-russia-ap-reports/	2025-01-31T16:49:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2160823562.jpg
Trump claims he and Putin could take 'significant' steps to end Russia’s war in Ukraine	Former U.S. President Donald Trump said on Jan. 31 that his team has already engaged in &quot;very serious&quot; discussions with Russia about its war in Ukraine. He suggested that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin could soon take &quot;significant steps&quot; toward ending the conflict. &quot;We will be speaking, and I think we will perhaps do something that&#x2019;ll be significant,&quot; Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. &quot;We want to end that war. That war would not have started if I was president.&quot; Trump did not clarify who in his administration has been in contact with Russia but insisted that discussions were already underway. When asked if he had personally spoken with Putin, he declined to answer directly: &quot;I don&#x2019;t want to say that.&quot; He has repeatedly claimed that the war would not have started under his leadership, despite the fact that hostilities between Ukraine and Russian proxies in eastern Ukraine escalated during his presidency, leading up to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Since returning to office, Trump has criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky, arguing that he should have negotiated with Putin to prevent the war. He has also promised to end the conflict quickly if elected in 2024, frequently attacking President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration for providing billions in military and economic aid to Ukraine. In a recent interview with Russian state television, Putin praised Trump, calling him a &quot;clever and pragmatic man&quot; focused on U.S. interests. &quot;We always had a business-like, pragmatic but also trusting relationship with the current U.S. president,&quot; Putin said. &quot;I couldn&#x2019;t disagree with him that if he had been president if they hadn&#x2019;t stolen victory from him in 2020, the crisis that emerged in Ukraine in 2022 could have been avoided.&quot; Trump&#x2019;s relationship with Putin has long been a subject of scrutiny. During his 2016 campaign, he publicly urged Russia to find and release Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s deleted emails. As president, he dismissed U.S. intelligence findings on Russian election interference and instead sided with Putin, later calling his actions in Ukraine &quot;genius&quot; and &quot;savvy.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-claims-he-and-putin-could-take-significant-steps-to-end-russias-war-in-ukraine/	2025-01-31T14:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2150483714.jpg
Ukrainian director Chernov wins Documentary Directing award at Sundance	Ukrainian journalist and director Mstyslav Chernov won the Best Documentary Direction award at the Sundance Film Festival on Jan. 31 for his film &quot;2,000 Meters to Andriivka&quot; in the World Cinema category. The documentary follows Ukraine&#x2019;s 2023 counteroffensive, as Chernov embeds with a platoon from the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade. Their mission was to liberate Andriivka, a strategically important village in Donetsk Oblast. Surrounded by mines, the village is accessible only through a narrow stretch of forest, making the battle particularly grueling. &#x1F3C6; The Directing Award: World Cinema Documentary goes to Mstyslav Chernov @mstyslavchernov for &#x201C;2000 Meters to Andriivka&#x201D; pic.twitter.com/wc1W1RP9lO &quot;This is the story of Ukrainian soldiers fighting for every inch of their land,&quot; Chernov said. &quot;It&#x2019;s the story of a small forest and the village of Andriivka, located just two hours from my hometown. It&#x2019;s the story of modern warfare&#x2014;how it&#x2019;s fought, how it&#x2019;s endured, and how it changes us.&quot; Chernov worked on the project with Associated Press photographer Oleksandr Babienko. The film was produced by Michelle Misner and Rainey Aronson-Rath, both of whom won an Oscar for &quot;20 Days in Mariupol.&quot; Misner also served as the film&#x2019;s editor. Chernov, an acclaimed war correspondent and documentary filmmaker, was invited last year to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, a body of more than 10,000 members that votes on the annual Oscar winners. His previous film, &quot;20 Days in Mariupol,&quot; won the Oscar for Best Documentary at the 96th Academy Awards last March. The film captures the Russian siege of Mariupol in the early weeks of the full-scale invasion, offering a firsthand account from Chernov and his team. It is the first Ukrainian-directed film to ever receive an Oscar.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-director-chernov-awarded-best-documentary-director-at-sundance/	2025-01-31T13:27:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1759941515.jpg
Ukraine war latest: North Korean troops not seen for 3 weeks in parts of Kursk Oblast, Ukraine’s special forces say	Key developments on Jan. 31: North Korean troops have not been seen for roughly three weeks in the areas of Kursk Oblast where Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces (SOF) are fighting, the unit&apos;s spokesperson, Colonel Oleksandr Kindratenko, told the Kyiv Independent on Jan. 31. The comment comes as undisclosed Ukrainian and U.S. officials told The New York Times that North Korean troops had been taken off the front lines after suffering heavy casualties. &quot;These are standard measures &#x2013; rotation due to large casualties,&quot; a military intelligence source commented for the Kyiv Independent, confirming the reports. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Jan. 19 that roughly half of the 11-12,000-strong North Korean contingent deployed to the embattled Russian region have been killed or wounded. Experts interviewed by the Kyiv Independent connected North Korea&#x2019;s high casualty rates to a lack of experience with modern warfare, the &quot;human wave&quot; tactics employed against entrenched Ukrainian positions, and the resolve of North Korean troops to avoid capture, even at the cost of their own lives. In a video, a large assault group of purportedly North Korean soldiers is seen crossing an open field and forest, followed by close combat footage with only dozens of meters between the two sides. In the end, graphic footage shows killed soldiers claimed to be North Koreans. The Ukrainian fighters held off the assault with small arms, grenade launchers, and snipers. Eventually, the Ukrainian troops retreated in two Humvees, the post read. Previous comments by Ukrainian officials earlier this week suggest that North Korean troops may have been taken off the front lines only temporarily. Ukrainian soldiers are now using a long-range drone capable of traveling up to 2,000 kilometers (1,242 miles) and carrying a 250-kilogram air bomb, the Unmanned Systems Forces said on Jan. 31. The drone is described as a &#x201C;unique development&#x201D; and a potential game changer on the battlefield. The military did not disclose the number of drones in service or additional details about their capabilities. &quot;Russian propaganda constantly claims to have &apos;shot down&apos; such aircraft, but explosions at military-industrial complexes, refineries, and ammunition depots suggest otherwise,&quot; the statement read. The drones, operated by Ukraine&apos;s 14th Regiment of Unmanned Aircraft Systems, have targeted Russian facilities for more than a year, &#x201C;flying hundreds and sometimes thousands of kilometers,&#x201D; according to the statement. &#x201C;There have already been dozens of such missions, and there will be more,&#x201D; the military said. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. Ukrainian drones attacked an oil refinery owned by Lukoil, one of Russia&apos;s largest oil producers, in Volgograd Oblast overnight on Jan. 31, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. Flashes and explosions were recorded near the plant, though the extent of the damage is still being assessed, the military said, adding it was &quot;one of the 10 largest oil refineries in Russia in terms of design capacity.&quot; &quot;The refinery produces gasoline, diesel fuel, fuel oil, and aviation fuel,&quot; Andrii Kovalenko, head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, later said. The Lukoil refinery in Volgograd Oblast &#xA0;lies around 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the front line in Ukraine, and was targeted in a joint operation of the Unmanned Systems Forces and Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR). It has been targeted multiple times during the war, including in February, July, and September 2023. Russian forces launched missile strikes on Odesa&#x2019;s historic center on the evening of Jan. 31, injuring at least two people, Mayor Hennadii Trukhanov said. Three explosions were reported around 8 p.m. local time, shortly after Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force warned of missile launches from the Black Sea. &quot;The strikes are directly targeting the city, hitting ordinary civilian buildings. Again and again: Air defense systems are the first priority,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Videos and photos shared on social media show damage to the five-star Bristol Hotel. One of the injured is a hotel employee, according to Odesa Oblast Governor Oleh Kiper. Debris also fell near the Opera House, a well-known downtown landmark. Trukhanov said the attack caused significant damage in Odesa&#x2019;s UNESCO-protected historic district.

(Oleh Kiper/Telegram)Finland announces $206 million military package for UkraineThe Finnish government has approved its 27th military aid package for Ukraine worth 198 million euros ($206 million), the Finnish Defense Ministry said on Jan. 31. This brings Finland&apos;s total defense aid provided to Ukraine since the outbreak of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022 to 2.5 billion euros ($2.6 billion). As with the previous Finnish aid packages, the content of the latest tranche is classified. &quot;This package of almost 200 million euros has been built in close cooperation with Ukraine. We are providing exactly the kind of support that will help Ukraine defend itself in an acute situation on the front,&quot; Finnish Defense Minister Antti Hakkanen said in a press release. &quot;It is up to us Europeans how Europe&apos;s security continues to develop. Securing Ukraine&apos;s independence and ability to defend itself is the most important thing right now,&quot; Hakkanen said.

US foreign aid transformed Ukraine. Its suspension threatens a setback	Editor&#x2019;s Note: The Kyiv Independent isn&#x2019;t a recipient of U.S. foreign aid, and its funding wasn&#x2019;t affected by the aid freeze. With the stroke of a pen, U.S. President Donald Trump last week put a freeze on projects that have helped Ukraine become freer and more democratic since the earliest days of its independence in 1991. The White House ordered a 90-day suspension of U.S. foreign aid-funded projects globally, to ascertain if they aligned with &quot;American interests&quot; and &quot;American values.&quot; The agencies affected include the National Endowment for Democracy, the Food for Peace Emergency Program, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), an organization particularly active in Ukraine. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, USAID has provided Ukraine with $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support, helping to rebuild schools after Russian attacks, pay for bomb shelters, advanced medical equipment for hospitals and much more. Yet USAID&apos;s support for Ukraine began well before the full-scale invasion and, according to people who have worked on such projects, their work is vital, and their value immeasurable. Ukrainian photographer Vladyslav Sodel, who has been capturing USAID&#x2019;s work in Ukraine for the past eight years, said people &quot;can&apos;t even imagine&quot; how deeply all the funds provided by USAID have become woven into Ukrainians&apos; lives &quot;to the point where they don&#x2019;t even suspect it.&quot; In a post on Facebook, Sodel said this aid ranges from &quot;a bed with a mattress&quot; for war refugees, to &quot;multi-billion-dollar investments&quot; in Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure that has been ravaged by Russian mass missile attacks. This &quot;support from the American people&quot; has allowed Ukrainians to &quot;move forward and achieve something greater,&quot; he added. Opinion polls show that Americans significantly overestimate the proportion of the U.S. federal budget that is spent on foreign aid, believing it to be around 25 percent when in fact it was only around 1 percent in 2023, amounting to just 0.25% of GDP. Yet due to the size of the U.S. economy, this translates to 40 percent of all humanitarian aid globally. And it&apos;s not just a one-way street &#x2014; while hugely benefiting the citizens of the countries in which it is spent, U.S. foreign aid also has positive impacts on American citizens back home, Professor Liam Swiss, a foreign aid expert and head of the department of sociology at Canada&apos;s Acadia University, told the Kyiv Independent. Highlighting USAID programs to fund polio immunization, Swiss said that unless someone steps in to fill the gap, it could harm the global drive to eradicate the disease. &quot;The only reason we aren&apos;t dealing with polio in the U.S. or in Canada, or the U.K. now, is because we&apos;ve kind of had these successful immunization campaigns to eliminate it,&quot; he said. Another consequence of reducing or cutting foreign aid that Swiss highlights is the potential of it exacerbating one of the most pressing issues for many Trump supporters &#x2014; immigration. Cars are parked on Saint Michael&#x2019;s Square during a handover ceremony by the UN Population Fund in Kyiv, Ukraine, on April 25, 2023. (Oleksii Samsonov/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)&quot;If you abandon support&#x2026; does that actually start to drive further migration from those parts of the world that are then furthering the MAGA-perceived border crisis?&quot; he said. According to Deborah Fairlamb, the co-founder of Green Flag Ventures, who previously worked on several USAID-funded projects in Ukraine, there is also a public misconception that USAID is used by the U.S. to dictate terms and conditions on countries, a mistruth often exploited by Russia and its supporters. &#x201C;It&apos;s not the U.S. coming in and unilaterally telling Ukraine what it needs and deciding this. It is always done in conjunction with (the state) and the approval,&#x201D; she told the Kyiv Independent, adding the Russian propaganda narrative that &quot;USAID is an arm of the CIA&quot; has no basis in reality. With the signing of a bilateral agreement between Ukraine and USAID in 1992, the agency started working alongside the Ukrainian government to build a competitive market economy, implement crucial social reforms, provide humanitarian, technical, and financial assistance, and help Ukraine navigate its post-Soviet transition. &#x201C;Thus began a 30-year partnership that has endured, animated by the belief that by working together, we can forge a secure and prosperous future for all Ukrainians,&#x201D; reads the USAID statement on its work in Ukraine. In over 30 years of working in Ukraine, USAID has played a key role in transforming numerous sectors that often go unnoticed. Dmytro Boyarchuk, the executive director of the Centre for Social and Economic Research (CASE Ukraine), said that Ukraine would not have been able to implement vital reforms without the support of international donors like USAID. The USAID&#x2019;s technical assistance program which provides expert advice, support, and resources to help countries implement reforms and achieve development goals, played a big role in transforming Ukraine after the EuroMaidan Revolution that ended the rule of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014. Boyarchuk says that back then, the &quot;reform-minded&quot; people took advantage of it to introduce changes and push solutions through the parliament. USAID&apos;s efforts have also included supporting judicial reforms and anti-corruption initiatives, and promoting transparency and accountability in governance. It also supported Ukraine&#x2019;s 2014 decentralization reform, which granted more economic and political freedom to small villages and towns. While USAID&#x2019;s impact on freedom of speech in Ukraine can only be traced &quot;indirectly,&quot; the organization greatly supported Ukrainian human rights activists and journalists, says Oksana Romaniuk, chief of the Kyiv-based Institute of Mass Information (IMI). &quot;We, in turn, monitored freedom of speech, we made statements, we held protests, we developed media legislation,&quot; Romaniuk told the Kyiv Independent, adding USAID was a &quot;supporting structure&quot; for independent media. But in 2022, Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion reshaped the focus and priorities of USAID&#x2019;s work in Ukraine. &quot;When the (all-out) war started, everything shifted into survival mode. And it was not just USAID, it was the entire country,&quot; says Fairlamb. Before that, USAID may have been helping a community &quot;develop a business plan and figure out how best to use the new tax-free resources,&quot; Fairlamb says, but after Feb. 24, 2022, the critical issue became &quot;making sure people in that community had electricity, and that those who had been displaced could find homes.&quot; It is these seemingly small efforts that have played a crucial role in helping Ukraine lessen the devastating impact of the full-scale war. Mykolaiv-based entrepreneur Tetiana Viaznikova says the small grant that she received thanks to USAID has helped save lives during the war. Back in 2021, Viaznikova launched her first aid course &quot;Sample&quot; but Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war forced her to switch to working at a military administration center in southern Ukraine. Then last summer, she quit her job and decided to scale the courses up. A small grant of Hr 410,000 (around $9,700) allowed her to purchase new tourniquets and mannequins, expand her course offerings, and order a marketing strategy. &quot;It wasn&#x2019;t just money to get by &#x2014; it was a boost that helped me scale my business,&quot; Viaznikova says. &quot;Thanks to a marketing strategy, I found clients and continue to train people.&quot; Since last fall, over 750 people have undergone her training, and several of them have already saved lives using their new skills. &quot;For small business owners and those just starting out, even small amounts of money, like mini-grants, provide a foundation that gives you the opportunity to start and scale up,&quot; Viaznikova says.

(Volodymyr Tarasov / Ukrinform / Getty Images)There are thousands of success stories like Viaznikova&#x2019;s across Ukraine, all made possible by USAID, from training teachers and providing scholarships for researchers, to supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure and agriculture. A farmer from war-torn Kharkiv Oblast managed to save his crops after receiving costly fertilizers for free, while Ukrainian internally displaced persons (IDPs) gained access to vital medication and essential goods. The work of USAID in just one territorial community in Chernihiv Oblast amply demonstrates its impact. USAID-funded projects have created spaces for young people, organized workshops and training sessions for locals, supplied new equipment for municipal services and hospitals, and much more. &quot;The stop of USAID&#x2019;s support means lost opportunities,&quot; Andriy Tkach, the secretary of the Sosnytsia village council, told the Kyiv Independent. While the U.S. has issued a waiver for &quot;life-saving humanitarian assistance,&quot; most USAID-funded programs in Ukraine now face at least a three-month pause in funding, and an even more dire situation if it is not renewed after the U.S. State Department review. Boyarchuk said Ukraine&#x2019;s agriculture sector &#x2014; &quot;the key sector today that is holding up the economy, with more than 60% of commodity exports being agricultural products&quot; &#x2014; is largely dependent on donors&#x2019; support. &quot;And while we praise their (farmers&#x2019;) resilience, their equipment was damaged, destroyed, or taken &#x2014; this is all a significant cost, and they have to continue working,&quot; he adds. Many Ukrainian non-profits and media outlets are already appealing for alternative funds and donations, while others have decided to halt certain operations. Veteran Hub, an NGO that supports Ukrainian soldiers, war veterans, and their families, announced that it had to close its operations in Vinnytsia. Ukrainian Veterans at Veteran Hub, an NGO supporting Ukrainian soldiers, war veterans, and their families in Kyiv, Ukraine. (Veteran Hub / Facebook)Ukrainian media, especially regional outlets, are under threat as well. According to Romaniuk, nearly 90% of regional media funding relies on grants, with advertising accounting for only 3-10% of their revenue. &quot;At the start of the invasion, over 300 regional outlets shut down due to financial strain, Russian attacks, and people fleeing,&quot; Romaniuk says, adding: &quot;This may lead to another wave of media shutdowns.&quot; Bogdan Logvynenko, founder of Ukrainer, a popular online magazine that lost most of its funding due to the U.S. aid freeze, says that Trump&#x2019;s decision is not just about Ukraine &quot;but about a new isolationist policy of the U.S.&quot; &quot;How will the (media) sector survive this? I think it may shrink by half,&quot; he says.	https://kyivindependent.com/how-us-foreign-aid-transformed-ukraine-through-the-years/	2025-01-31T11:42:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/48381089_2332694146962651_4325046064370417664_n.jpg
Ukraine's unlikely ally against Russian attacks on energy sector — warm weather	Nearly three years into the war, Ukrainians have grown used to bracing for brutal winters with electricity blackouts and heating cuts from Russian attacks on the country&#x2019;s energy infrastructure. This winter was predicted to be one of the toughest ones of the war yet. In a worst-case scenario, blackouts were expected to reach 20 hours a day. Greenpeace warned in November that Ukraine&#x2019;s power grid faced a &quot;heightened risk of catastrophic failure.&#x201D; But thanks to a combination of unseasonably warm weather, and Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to adapt to a third year of Russian campaigns against its energy system, the worst has not come to pass. Since Russia began targeting Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure in late 2022, the country has learned to better protect the power grid, figuring out how to make repairs in record time following Russian strikes. Climate change &#x2014; which has been causing warmer winters each year in Ukraine &#x2014; has also become Ukraine&apos;s unexpected ally in resisting Russia&#x2019;s tactic of freezing Ukrainians into submission. &#x201C;The fact that we have such warm weather of +6, +7 degrees Celsius (42-44 degrees Fahrenheit) is fantastically positive for us,&#x201D; said Oleksandr Kharchenko, managing director of the Energy Industry Research Center, crediting the mild winter as a main factor for the lack of problems with power in Ukraine. In the past, Ukraine had hot summers and cold winters, consistent with its mostly continental climate. Snow and temperatures below zero degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) characterized every winter, including the one in 2014 when the Euromaidan Revolution unfolded and protesters on Independence Square in Kyiv danced to patriotic chants to warm up. Things are different now. Ukraine&#x2019;s Environment Ministry on Jan.19 went as far as to say in a social media post that, &#x201C;Due to global warming, there is no climactic winter in Ukraine (this year).&#x201D; &#x201C;If the winter used to be a season of frost and snow, then now the weather often reminds of late autumn or early spring,&#x201D; the ministry wrote. The Central Geophysical Observatory declared 2024 &#x201C;the warmest year on record&#x201D; in Kyiv, with the December average at zero degrees Celsius. Temperatures were above zero every day the last week of January, a record for the country, the observatory said. &#x201C;Ukraine is one of the regions of the planet where the temperature has been rising at the highest rate over the past decade,&#x201D; said Svitlana Krakovska, head of the applied climatology laboratory at the Ukrainian Hydrometeorological Institute. &#x201C;And the main warming occurs primarily in winter,&#x201D; she was cited as having said in the ministry&#x2019;s post on social media. Ukraine hasn&#x2019;t yet had to implement any country-wide rolling blackouts in 2025, according to open data collected by the Energy Map. These scheduled limitations of electricity supply for businesses and households were put in place at various times throughout the previous years to cut the consumption in peak hours to avoid the collapse of the country&#x2019;s strained power system. Hours-long blackouts were widely used throughout the country for much of the spring and summer of 2024 following Russia&#x2019;s bombing of power plants and transmission stations, and during scheduled repairs of the nuclear power plants. The power cuts were implemented sporadically throughout December. Women ride a scooter on Khreshchatyk Street in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Jan. 23, 2025, amid the Russian invasion.

(Anatolii Stepanov/AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;As you can see, electricity is now being supplied without restrictions almost all over the country, apart from the front-line regions, where the situation is difficult in general,&#x201D; Kharchenko told the Kyiv Independent. As the temperature continues to hover at or above zero, the country&#x2019;s energy system hasn&#x2019;t yet entered a red zone where it has to start cutting power. &#x201C;Every degree below zero Celsius requires an additional 200 megawatts (MW) of power,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;With our current operating capacities, we simply don&#x2019;t have enough (to cater) for temperatures of minus three and four degrees Celsius (24-26 degrees Fahrenheit) and below.&#x201D; Russia has regularly targeted Ukrainian critical infrastructure since it began its campaign in 2022, destroying over half of the country&#x2019;s pre-war power system capacities. &#x201C;In 2022-2023, Ukraine&apos;s power system lost about 21 gigawatts (GW) of capacity,&#x201D; out of the 47 GW before the full-on war, wrote Oksana Zueva, a senior expert in open data at Kyiv-based think tank DiXi Group. To take that much capacity out, Moscow carried out at least thirty massive attacks on energy facilities, according to open data gathered by the Energy Map. The attacks evolved over time to use various weapons and tactics, while Russia&#x2019;s goal remained the same: plunging Ukraine into a humanitarian crisis, making regular citizens&#x2019; lives as difficult as possible, and destabilizing the country before any possible peace talks in the future.

(Genya Savilov/AFP via Getty Images)Around 10 GW of energy generation was knocked out in 2024 due to Russia&#x2019;s missile and drone attacks, the Energy Ministry told the Kyiv Independent. Since mid-November, six massive attacks were launched by Russia over the two and a half months of this winter season, causing &#x201C;much greater damage and destruction than in previous years,&#x201D; the ministry added. The attacks included anywhere between 70 to 90 cruise or ballistic missiles and 90 to 120 drones each time, as well as internationally banned cluster munitions. &#x201C;But they didn&#x2019;t reach their goals,&#x201D; Kharchenko told the Kyiv Independent. According to Kharchenko, Ukraine has also gotten much better in resisting Russia&#x2019;s attacks on energy in over two years since they began. It improved coordination with air defense protecting the power system and built some fortifications that have already proved effective. Experience also helps when the attacks succeed: at this point, there are reserves of equipment to restore the damaged facilities and clear plans for bypassing them in the grid and restoring them as quickly as possible, Kharchenko said. A lot of that equipment is pledged or financed by international partners, the Energy Ministry told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;In 2024, Ukrenergo&apos;s repair teams set an absolute record by replacing an autotransformer at one of its substations within three weeks,&#x201D; Ukraine&apos;s state grid operator Ukrenergo told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;This included transportation, installation, and connection. For comparison, in EU countries, such works are carried out in three to four months,&#x201D; the statement said. Warm weather also contributed to the speed of repairs, Ukrenergo said. However, with temperatures projected to drop in the coming days, Ukraine needs to secure its energy supply for any weather.

(Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;For the Ukrainian power system to operate efficiently and confidently, we need to build about 4-4.5 GW of additional peaking power plants,&#x201D; Kharchenko said. Peaking power plants are meant to step in during peak periods of consumption to avoid blackouts. They should be able to quickly increase or decrease the energy output, which is impossible for the three Ukrainian-controlled nuclear power plants that currently supply up to 55-60% of the country&#x2019;s energy, according to Kharchenko. Peaking power plants could be coal-based, hydroelectric, or gas-powered, Kharchenko added, as other types of power are either dependent on weather conditions or too long to develop. But so far, it was coal-based thermal plants, hydroelectric plants, and the transmission grid around them that were targeted by Russian attacks the most. Eighty percent of Ukraine&#x2019;s pre-war coal-fired power capacities were destroyed, though some of them were restored, Kharchenko said. Nine Ukrainian hydroelectric plants remaining after Russia&apos;s destruction of the Kakhovka dam still generate up to 12% of the country&#x2019;s energy despite Russian attacks. &#x201C;Unfortunately, we can&#x2019;t build many of them,&#x201D; Kharchenko said, referring to the limitations of the country&#x2019;s natural river resources needed to build more hydroelectric generation.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-unlikely-ally-against-russian-attacks-on-energy-sector-warm-weather/	2025-01-31T11:32:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194146058.jpg
Russian missiles strike Odesa’s historic center, injuring 2	Russian forces launched missile strikes on Odesa&#x2019;s historic center on the evening of Jan. 31, injuring at least two people, Mayor Hennadii Trukhanov said. Three explosions were reported around 8 p.m. local time, shortly after Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force warned of missile launches from the Black Sea. &quot;The strikes are directly targeting the city, hitting ordinary civilian buildings. Again and again: Air defense systems are the first priority,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Videos and photos shared on social media show damage to the five-star Bristol Hotel. One of the injured is a hotel employee, according to Odesa Oblast Governor Oleh Kiper. Debris also fell near the Opera House, a well-known downtown landmark. Trukhanov said the attack caused significant damage in Odesa&#x2019;s UNESCO-protected historic district. The city&apos;s historic center was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in January 2023. In July of that year, a Russian missile strike damaged over 20 architectural monuments and heavily hit the Transfiguration Cathedral. Odesa, a port city on Ukraine&#x2019;s Black Sea coast with a population of around 1 million, has been a frequent target of Russian attacks throughout the full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-targets-odesa-historical-center/	2025-01-31T11:26:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1241068016.jpg
Netherlands to send more F-16s in 2025, Ukrainian defense minister says	The Netherlands will deliver another batch of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine in 2025, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Jan. 31. Ukraine has already received U.S.-made F-16s from the Netherlands and Denmark, deploying them in air defense roles during Russian missile strikes. The first jets arrived in August 2024. The F-16 program was a key focus of Umerov&#x2019;s meeting with Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans in The Hague. The Netherlands will continue training Ukrainian pilots, engineers, and technicians, Umerov said after visiting the base where Ukrainian personnel are gaining hands-on experience in servicing and repairing the aircraft. &quot;This is yet another step toward establishing a full-fledged aviation infrastructure in Ukraine,&quot; Umerov said. Umerov also met with representatives of Dutch defense companies who showcased missiles, drones, and radars. He and Brekelmans discussed further development of Ukraine&#x2019;s drone capabilities, the 400 million euros ($415 million) in military aid previously announced by the Netherlands, and joint projects to enhance Ukraine&#x2019;s long-range strike capacity. &quot;Industrial cooperation is another key focus. The next logical step is the development of joint defense enterprises to strengthen our armed forces,&quot; Umerov added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-receive-new-batch-of-f-16-batch/	2025-01-31T11:17:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/474771783_1011806427434364_8970661374252198735_n.jpg
Ukraine deploys long-range drone capable of 2,000 km strike, military says	Ukrainian soldiers are now using a long-range drone capable of traveling up to 2,000 kilometers (1,242 miles) and carrying a 250-kilogram air bomb, the Unmanned Systems Forces said on Jan. 31. The drone is described as a &#x201C;unique development&#x201D; and a potential game changer on the battlefield. The military did not disclose the number of drones in service or additional details about their capabilities. &quot;Russian propaganda constantly claims to have &apos;shot down&apos; such aircraft, but explosions at military-industrial complexes, refineries, and ammunition depots suggest otherwise,&quot; the statement read. Ukraine regularly targets Russian oil facilities with long-range drone strikes in an effort to disrupt fuel supplies to the Russian military and reduce Moscow&apos;s energy export revenues. Oil profits remain a crucial source of funding for Russia&apos;s war efforts. The drones, operated by Ukraine&apos;s 14th Regiment of Unmanned Aircraft Systems, have targeted Russian facilities for more than a year, &#x201C;flying hundreds and sometimes thousands of kilometers,&#x201D; according to the statement. &#x201C;There have already been dozens of such missions, and there will be more,&#x201D; the military said. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. Throughout Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, both Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing warfare tactics. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and are frequently used by Ukrainian troops for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks. Ukraine produced more than 30,000 bomber drones in 2024, according to Ukraine&apos;s Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-deploys-long-range-drone-capable-of-2-000-km-strike-military-says/	2025-01-31T09:57:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/--------------2025-01-31-193201.png
Defense Ministry approves Ukrainian-made Hromylo drone for military use	The Ukrainian-made Hromylo unmanned aerial vehicle has been approved for military use, the Defense Ministry announced on Jan. 31. Equipped with engines capable of carrying a payload, the first-person-view (FPV) drones can target personnel, equipment, and field shelters, according to the statement. These drones are capable of operating both day and night and are resistant to electronic warfare, the ministry added. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and successfully deployed for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks throughout the ongoing war with Russia. As of December, Ukraine has delivered over 200,000 domestically-produced drones to front-line units, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-approves-homemade-hromylo-aerial-vehicle-for-military-use/	2025-01-31T09:29:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/hromylo-99e244dbfd.webp
Ukraine’s inflation set to peak by mid-2025, cool to 8% by year-end, central bank says	Ukraine&#x2019;s inflation rate is expected to peak at 15% by mid-2025 before dropping to 8.4% by year&apos;s end, Ukraine&#x2019;s Central Bank said on Jan. 31. Poor harvests and higher wages amid labor shortages are currently driving the rising inflation, according to the bank. Inflation in Ukraine accelerated to 12% year-on-year in December 2024, surpassing the bank&#x2019;s earlier projections. Core inflation, which excludes volatile items like food and fuel, rose to 10.7% in December 2024, with service prices increasing by 12.5%. The bank responded by raising its key interest rate to 14.5% to curb inflation expectations. After peaking in the middle of the year and cooling to 8.4% by year&#x2019;s end, the bank expects inflation to reach a target 5% in 2025. The slowdown is expected to be driven by the bank&#x2019;s interest rate policy measures, currency market stability, a new harvest, a narrowing of the fiscal deficit, and moderate external price pressure. Ukraine has secured assurances from its international partners for $38.4 billion in financial aid for 2025, including support from the U.S., said Andrii Pyshnyi, the bank&#x2019;s head. The risk of not receiving the expected funding in 2025 is low, he said. &quot;External financing, together with the possibilities of the domestic debt market, will allow the government to cover the budget deficit without resorting to emission,&quot; Pyshnyi wrote on Facebook. The bank expects real gross domestic product (GDP) to grow by 3.6% in 2025, with further acceleration to around 4% in the next two years. Growth will come from investments in energy and production recovery, growing domestic demand, and better harvests. The impacts of the war, labor issues, and low production investment will hold continue GDP growth back. The bank&#x2019;s forecast is based on continued international support and a gradual economic recovery, including a return of Ukrainians who fled abroad at the outset of the full-scale invasion, as well as investment growth.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-inflation-set-to-peak-by-mid-2025-cool-to-8-by-year-end-central-bank-says/	2025-01-31T08:48:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-502752806-1.jpg
SBU probes alleged leak of Budanov’s statement on threat to Ukraine’s existence	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has launched a criminal investigation following media reports alleging that Ukraine&#x2019;s spy chief made a statement about a threat to the country&#x2019;s existence during a closed-door parliamentary meeting, Ukrainska Pravda reported on Jan. 31, citing the SBU. The case was opened under the legal provision on the disclosure of state secrets. Ukrainska Pravda published an article on Jan. 27 claiming that Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence (HUR), warned of serious consequences for Ukraine&#x2019;s existence if negotiations do not begin by the summer. The report, which cited an unnamed lawmaker who attended the meeting, did not specify what developments Budanov was allegedly referring to. HUR denied the report, calling the alleged quote attributed to Budanov &#x201C;false.&#x201D; The SBU said the investigation involves individuals who had access to the classified session in parliament. &quot;We act within the law and strictly adhere to professional journalistic standards. Ukrainska Pravda, as always, stands by its sources, which are protected under Ukrainian and international law,&quot; said Sevgil Musayeva, Ukrainska Pravda&apos;s editor-in-chief. The reports come amid growing speculation about potential peace talks, as U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged to bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table.	https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-probes-alleged-leak-of-budanovs-statement-on-threat-to-ukraines-existence/	2025-01-31T08:30:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2180021113.jpg
Norway should cede its war windfall to Ukraine	Norway&#x2019;s government has effectively become a war profiteer, we argued in a commentary in December. It is an opinion shared by a number of European politicians, and by European and Norwegian media. But rather than paying attention, Norway&#x2019;s government is getting defensive. The basic facts are not up for debate. After the outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian War caused natural gas prices to rise sharply in Europe, Norway reaped windfall profits totaling some 108 billion euros ($113 billion), according to the Norwegian Finance Ministry. That is more than the value of all military and civilian support Ukraine has received from the United States and Germany combined from when the war started through October 2024. It is roughly one-third of the value of the Russian central-bank assets that are currently frozen in the West (and which Western governments have extensively debated channeling to Ukraine for defense and reconstruction). But Norway has kept its windfall for itself, providing a measly 3 billion euros ($3.1 billion) in aid to Ukraine in its 2025 budget, only slightly up from the previous year. This approach is simply wrong: Norway must transfer its recent &#x201C;super-profits,&#x201D; excess profits above the normal level, in full, directly to Ukraine. Unfortunately, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St&#xF8;re and Norwegian Finance Minister Trygve Slagsvold Vedum seem more interested in justifying their decision not to do so than in helping Ukraine, Europe, or even future Norwegians. St&#xF8;re and Vedum contend that the windfall gains were a normal result of the myriad market forces that determine gas prices. But this argument is disingenuous. While it is true that many factors shape energy prices, Norway&#x2019;s excess profits overwhelmingly reflect one: in 2022-23, it had in Europe a captive market for its natural-gas exports. This was a direct result of the Ukraine war: Russia had cut its natural-gas supplies to Europe, but European gas importers had not yet managed to build liquefied natural gas terminals to offset the loss. St&#xF8;re and Vedum do not stop at dismissing Norway&#x2019;s war profits as good fortune; they claim that their government, and the oil companies operating in Norway, did our European neighbors a favor by stepping up gas supplies when Russian deliveries ceased. Europe should be thanking us, Vedum says. This &#x201C;Good Samaritan&#x201D; narrative smacks of hypocrisy, especially as Norway, while pocketing its lucky gains from the spike in gas prices, sends a pittance to the Ukrainians fighting and dying for their country&#x2019;s survival and Europe&#x2019;s security. Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St&#xF8;re speaks to the press after the Think Tank Agenda event at the University Aula in Oslo, Norway, on Jan. 28, 2025. (Ole Berg-Rusten / NTB / AFP via Getty Images)In fact, from the perspective of European gas consumers, the elevated gas prices were equivalent to a Norwegian &#x201C;war tax&#x201D; on them. The increased energy costs strained the budgets of households and companies, thereby reducing European governments&#x2019; room to raise taxes for supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s war effort. And yet, many of these countries have still managed to provide far more support to Ukraine, as a share of GDP, than Norway has. St&#xF8;re and Vedum say that, rather than use its windfall as a &#x201C;political instrument,&#x201D; the excess profits should go directly into the Government Pension Fund Global, Norway&#x2019;s sovereign wealth fund, where they will be preserved for future generations of Norwegians. This position aligns with Norway&#x2019;s longstanding commitment to safeguarding its long-term fiscal sustainability, exemplified by a rule that no more than 3% of the fund&#x2019;s value can be transferred to the government budget each year. But St&#xF8;re and Vedum&#x2019;s position is short-sighted in the current context. After all, what could harm future generations of Norwegians more than the failure to preserve democracy, freedom, and the rule of law in Europe? In any case, the fiscal rule was created to prevent domestic macroeconomic problems (such as exchange-rate appreciation and excessive inflation), which would not arise if the funds were transferred directly to Ukraine. The leaders responsible for establishing it &#x2014; including former Norwegian Prime Minister and former NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg &#x2014; could not possibly have imagined that Norway&#x2019;s government would one day use it to justify holding on to wartime rents. Norway did provide critical energy supplies to Europe in a desperate moment. But in a purely fiscal sense, one can argue that the country did more to support Russia, as its captive market for gas (which it did nothing to create) limited its neighbors&#x2019; ability to raise wartime taxes, while Norway refrained from sending much aid to Ukraine. Meanwhile, Norway has enriched itself immensely, through the returns on the government&#x2019;s direct investments in oil and gas fields, dividends from its ownership share in its parastatal oil company Equinor, and tax revenues from oil companies, which are subject to a 78% marginal rate on their profits. Refusing to use this war windfall to support Ukraine&#x2019;s defense and reconstruction reflects a myopic perspective that Norway&#x2019;s government would do well to abandon. Despite our reluctance to join the European Union, we Norwegians are part of &#x2013; and dependent on &#x2013; the European community. Rather than focusing exclusively on narrow domestic interests, Norway&#x2019;s government must start considering the well-being of all of Europe. Growing threats to liberal democracy &#x2013; coming not only from our big neighbor to the East, but also from our big ally across the Atlantic &#x2013; makes this shift all the more urgent.

Ex-president Poroshenko may be suspended from parliament for three days instead of six months, lawmaker says	Ukraine&apos;s parliament may suspend former President Petro Poroshenko from sessions for three days rather than six months, Mykyta Poturayev, head of the Verkhovna Rada&apos;s Humanitarian and Information Policy Committee, told RFE/RL on Jan. 31. The Verkhovna Rada&apos;s Committee on Regulations recommended on Jan. 30 that Poroshenko be suspended over an alleged altercation with Servant of the People lawmaker Bohdan Yaremenko. Poroshenko&apos;s European Solidarity party accused President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s office of pressuring the ruling Servant of the People party to bar him from attending parliamentary sessions. &quot;As the person who authored this request, I will definitely vote for a decision that will give an assessment. And, if necessary, a certain punishment,&quot; Poturayev said. He added that European lawmakers could view a six-month suspension as disproportionate. &quot;I believe that if it were not for the war, then, according to the rules of procedure, the maximum that could happen to him is a suspension for three sessions, i.e., three days,&quot; Poturayev said. &quot;I hope that maybe the Committee on Regulations and other colleagues will be able to find some solution that will not be about six months.&quot; The European Solidarity claims that lawmakers from the Servant of the People faction have been allegedly pressured to vote in favor of barring Poroshenko from sessions, calling it an attempt to block his parliamentary work. European Solidarity MP Oleksii Honcharenko condemned the move as &quot;outright persecution of the opposition,&quot; warning that it could harm Ukraine&apos;s democratic reputation. &quot;This decision can turn into a terrible story. You are not harming an individual politician now; you are harming the whole country,&quot; he said. Yaremenko has not publicly commented on the incident, and the Verkhovna Rada has yet to support the committee&apos;s decision.	https://kyivindependent.com/poroshenko-may-be-suspended-from-parliament-for-three-days-instead-of-six-months-lawmaker-says/	2025-01-31T08:02:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1065624868.jpg
Slovakia bans Georgian Legion commander, linking him to alleged coup plot	Slovakia has banned Georgian Legion commander Mamuka Mamulashvili from entering the country after the government linked his unit to an alleged coup plot, Denn&#xED;k N reported on Jan. 31. The volunteers-based Georgian Legion, which has been fighting in Ukraine since 2014, was founded by Mamulashvili to combat Russian forces. Slovak Interior Minister Mat&#xFA;&#x161; &#x160;utaj-E&#x161;tok said a total of 10 people were on the list of individuals barred from entering Slovakia. During a press conference, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico did not explain how Mamulashvili could have organized protests in Slovakia or been behind the alleged coup plot. The demonstrations, held under the slogan &quot;Slovakia is Europe,&quot; swept across 30 cities on Jan. 24, with around 100,000 people nationwide chanting slogans like &quot;Enough of Fico&quot; and &quot;We are Europe&quot; in opposition to his policies and pro-Russian stance. The protests were also fueled by Fico&apos;s visit to Moscow in late December, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin &#x2014; one of the few European Union leaders to do so since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Fico cited a photo of Mamulashvili with Lucy &#x160;tasselov&#xE1; from the Peace for Ukraine initiative and Denn&#xED;k N commentator Martin &#x160;ime&#x10D;ka, both of whom supported the Georgian Legion, as evidence for his claim. The Georgian Legion dismissed the Slovak government&apos;s accusations as &quot;absurd and groundless.&quot; &quot;These statements are nothing more than a deliberate attempt to discredit our unit, which has been fighting alongside Ukraine against Russian aggression since 2014,&quot; Mamulashvili said. A similar accusation previously emerged in Georgia, where the State Security Service (SSG) alleged that the Georgian Legion, a former bodyguard of ex-President Mikheil Saakashvili, and Giorgi Lortkipanidze&#x2014;allegedly a deputy head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence&#x2014;were involved in a plot against the ruling pro-Russian Georgian Dream party. &quot;Now, the Slovak authorities have decided to follow the same Russian game, recycling the same lies to serve their own political agenda,&quot; Mamulashvili added. The news came a day after reports that the police in Slovakia detained a Ukrainian citizen on Jan. 30 suspected of preparing a coup in the country. Relations between Kyiv and Bratislava have become increasingly tense this month. Fico, who has long opposed military aid to Ukraine, has escalated threats against Kyiv following the termination of Russian gas transit via Ukrainian territory on Jan. 1.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovakia-bans-georgian-legion-head-from-entering-country-after-coup-plot-accusations/	2025-01-31T07:52:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1241658499.jpg
How Russia profits from arms exports despite sanctions	The Kyiv Independent analyzed leaked emails of a Russian defense company revealing Russia&#x2019;s arms trade after the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The letters confirm that Russia continued to fulfill a huge contract signed shortly before the attack on Ukraine to supply its air defense systems and missiles to Saudi Arabia. The emails also show that India, China, Algeria, Egypt, and a number of other countries continued to buy Russian weapons during the war, despite sanctions imposed on Russian defense companies. This feeds the Russian defense industry with export revenue and strengthens Russia&apos;s geopolitical ties.	https://kyivindependent.com/how-russia-profits-from-arms-exports-despite-sanctions/	2025-01-31T07:29:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/IMG_9812.JPG
Putin clears Goldman Sachs' exit from Russia with sale to Armenia-based firm	Russian President Vladimir Putin approved Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&apos;s exit from Russia on Jan. 31, allowing the U.S. firm to sell its business to the Armenia-based investment firm Balchug Capital. Goldman Sachs entered into a binding agreement to offload its Russian subsidiary, making it one of the few Western banks to exit the country entirely, Bloomberg reported. The decision follows a series of banking deals authorized by Putin, including a December decree allowing French bank Natixis to sell its Russian operations. Earlier this month, the Netherlands&apos; ING Groep NV reached an agreement to sell its Russian assets to Global Development JSC, a company owned by a Moscow-based financial investor. Nearly three years after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many Western banks remain operational in the country, despite earlier pledges to withdraw. Citigroup Inc. has ceased most corporate banking services in Russia but still holds $9 billion in assets there, according to Bloomberg. The largest Western banks operating in Russia paid &#x20AC;800 million ($857 million) in taxes to Moscow&apos;s budget in 2023 &#x2014; four times higher than before the invasion, according to the Financial Times. Russia&apos;s banking sector initially suffered from sweeping Western sanctions, with profits plummeting by 90% in 2022. The Kremlin has since stabilized the industry by increasing state control and expanding ties with non-Western financial institutions.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-clears-goldman-sachs-exit-from-russia-with-sale-to-armenia-based-firm/	2025-01-31T07:06:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194601867.jpg
Belarus Weekly: Lukashenko gets himself reelected for 7th consecutive term	Aleksandr Lukashenko has awarded himself a seventh term as president of Belarus, with the West calling the so-called vote a sham and introducing additional sanctions. Belarusian political observer Artsiom Shraibman told the Kyiv Independent that Lukashenko faces uncertain future after the vote. Hungary refuses to sign joint EU statement condemning Belarus&#x2019;s elections, RFE/RL reports. Fifteen more prisoners freed in tenth round of &#x2018;pardons&#x2019; issued by Lukashenko ahead of elections. Belarus &#x2018;unilaterally releases&#x2019; US citizen detained on politically motivated grounds, Washington reports on election day. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) files with ICC complaint against Belarus for systematic crimes against journalists. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko declared himself president for his seventh consecutive term after holding a presidential election on Jan. 26 that was decried as neither free nor fair. The first presidential election since the contested 2020 vote was held under conditions of strict repression, with over 1,250 political prisoners behind bars, all but four political parties banned, 1,800 NGOs shut down, and all opposition jailed or exiled. The Belarusian Central Election Committee released preliminary election results on Jan. 27, presenting Lukashenko with a record 86.82% of the votes. Stalinist Siarhei Syrankou was the runner-up with just 3.21%, scoring lower than the graph of &#x201C;against all candidates,&#x201D; which received 3.6% of the vote. The other token &#x201C;challengers&#x201D; fared even worse: Oleg Gaidukevich reportedly landed 2%, &#x201C;constructive opposition&#x201D; candidate Hanna Kanapatskaya got 1.86%, and in last place came Alexander Khizhnyak with 1.47%. The commission also claimed there was a record-high turnout of 85.7%. Nearly half of the votes &#x2014; 41.81% &#x2014; were supposedly cast in early voting, a practice criticized for being vulnerable to ballot-stuffing and other manipulations. No polling stations were opened abroad despite the Belarusian diaspora having been significantly enlarged in recent years. Reportedly, between 300,000 and 500,000 Belarusians have left the country of just under 9.2 million since 2020. There were no credible international observation teams monitoring the voting, as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) received an invitation only 10 days prior to the voting, rendering any effective observation impossible. The head of EU diplomacy, Kaja Kallas, and the EU Commissioner for Enlargement, Marta Kos, issued a statement on behalf of the EU rejecting the legitimacy of Lukashenko&#x2019;s election. Western nations, including Australia, Canada, the EU, New Zealand, and the UK, decried the elections as a &#x201C;sham&#x201D; in a joint statement. The UK and Canada followed up with a new round of sanctions targeting three Belarusian defense enterprises and six individuals, including Central Election Commission Chairman Ihar Karpenka, law enforcement officials accused of political repression, and heads of prisons. Canada extended restrictions against 10 individuals and 12 companies. The exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who claimed to have won the previous 2020 presidential race, dismissed this latest election as a &#x201C;special operation to illegally cling to power.&#x201D; &#x201C;Lukashenko, propped up by (Russian dictator Vladimir) Putin, holds 9 million Belarusians hostage, drags us into war, and betrays our sovereignty,&#x201D; Tsikhanouskaya wrote on X on Jan. 26. The exiled opposition held a march in Warsaw in protest at the rigged Belarusian presidential election. The next day, the Belarusian investigative committee claimed to have identified 365 participants in the march and opened in absentia criminal proceedings against them. Meanwhile, the Kremlin welcomed Lukashenko&#x2019;s contested election, declaring &#x201C;Moscow takes no notice of the expected criticism of the elections in Belarus in the West.&#x201D; Belarusian political analyst Artsiom Shraibman says Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko is entering a &#x201C;zone of uncertainty&#x201D; as he faces turning points in his relations with Russia and the need to resolve the transition of power amid an ongoing domestic political crisis. Dependent on Russian subsidies and having no room to improve relations with the West, Lukashenko can maintain the current status quo as Moscow&#x2019;s ally while the active phase of war continues,&#x201D; Shraibman says. &#x201C;Putin is interested in a stable pro-Russian authoritarian Belarus, he will keep it that way,&#x201D; he told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;The spending on supporting Lukashenko can be categorized as a military expenditure for the Russian government, so it is not something they will try to save money on.&#x201D; But depending on how any temporary or long-term settlement of the war affects Russia, Lukashenko might face two &#x201C;equally unpleasant extremes:&#x201D; Moscow switching its imperial appetites to Belarus, or losing interest in its client state altogether, leaving Lukashenko without financial aid. Lukashenko may seek dialogue with the United States, potentially releasing the remaining prisoners with U.S. ties. However, Shraibman notes that Lukashenko has little to offer to attract Western interest, given his &#x201C;peripheral role&#x201D; in resolving the war. Repression in Belarus, which has accelerated in the past few months, may decrease in the absence of election campaigns in the near term, but will remain sufficient to maintain a chokehold on society. While the individual fates of some political prisoners could be decided with pardons, Shraibman does not foresee and large-scale political &#x201C;thaw,&#x201D; especially not in light of another fundamental issue &#x2014; the possible transition of power. Lukashenko has long hinted that he might give up power, but has repeatedly backtracked. Lukashenko took his first real step to standing down, Shraibman argues, in 2022 when the dictator introduced the All-Belarus People&apos;s Assembly, an extra-governmental body, and made himself its head. So far it has no real powers, but it is effectively an institutional bolt hole to which Lukashenko might retreat after giving up the presidency. &#x201C;He is thinking about (the transition of power) and preparing for it, but this constitutional framework does not place any deadlines on him,&#x201D; Shraibman explains. At least until 2035, according to the Belarusian constitution, he can hold both positions: the presidency, and the head of the assembly.&#x201D; According to the analyst, another action that might indicate that Lukashenko is preparing to hand over the reins of power would be the selection and cultivation of a successor. &#x201C;But until we see some already high-profile official gets catapulted up the nomenclature ladder, and starts to be painted as a future leader, the only other reliable indicator of the chances of a transition of power is the state of (Lukashenko&#x2019;s) health.&#x201D; Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban listens to Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico speak during the joint press conference in the Mirror Hall of the Slovak Governmental Office on Jan. 21, 2025 in Bratislava, Slovakia. (Zuzana Gogova/Getty Images)Hungary refused to sign a joint EU members statement rejecting the presidential election in Belarus, sources told U.S. government-funded broadcaster Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) in Brussels. Failing to achieve unilateral support from all 27 members of the bloc, the head of EU diplomacy, Kaja Kallas, issued her own statement declaring that the Jan. 26 .&#x201D; In particular, Kallas criticized the late invitation sent to observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which prevented the proper monitoring of critical stages of the electoral campaign. She also called for the release of all political prisoners in Belarus. Initially, both Hungary and Slovakia refused to sign the draft EU joint statement, which referred to the elections in Belarus as &#x201C;undemocratic.&#x201D; RFE/RL said the draft statement also cited a &#x201C;relentless and unprecedented level of repression&#x201D; that &#x201C;has deprived the electoral process of any legitimacy.&#x201D; Representatives of Slovakia later agreed to sign, but Hungary, led by Russia-leaning Prime Minister Viktor Orban, could not be persuaded. Hungary has also consistently resisted stricter sanctions against Russia and Belarus, as well as increased European support for Ukraine. Hungarian Foreign Affairs Minister P&#xE9;ter Szijj&#xE1;rt&#xF3; was the only top-ranking European official since the fraudulent 2020 elections and subsequent crackdown on dissent. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko released 15 more political prisoners ahead of the country&#x2019;s sham presidential elections, rigged to ensure the Belarusian leader was elected for a seventh consecutive term. In the ten rounds of &#x201C;pardons&#x201D; that the Lukashenko regime initiated in July 2024 ahead of the Jan. 26 presidential elections, 293 political prisoners were released from custody. Despite the releases, the crackdown on dissent in Belarus continues, and some 1,250 individuals remain behind bars on politically motivated grounds. According to Lukashenko&#x2019;s press office, eight of the released prisoners were convicted of &#x201C;crimes of extremism&#x201D; &#x2013; a charge frequently brought up against political opponents since the fraudulent 2020 presidential elections. The other seven released had been found guilty of drug-related crimes. The announcement of the pardons, published on Jan. 24, two days prior to the elections, did not give the names of those being released but said that five men and three women were among pardoned political prisoners. Five reportedly have children, and one woman is pregnant. Lukashenko&#x2019;s press office again presented the pardons as &#x201C;demonstrations of mercy.&#x201D; Exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya in a Reuters interview published earlier accused Lukashenko of &#x201C;playing games&#x201D; with political prisoners. Belarusian political analysts consider the pardons to be part of Lukashenko&#x2019;s strategy to revive relations with the West, which were ruptured after Lukashenko&#x2019;s brutal crackdown on civil society in the aftermath of the 2020 elections and after he supported Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Since the 2020 election, over 60,000 Belarusian citizens have been detained for political reasons, and the count continues to rise, according to the Minsk-based human rights group Viasna. Belarus has &#x201C;unilaterally released&#x201D; a detained U.S. citizen, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on Jan. 26 &#x2014; the main day of voting in the sham Belarusian presidential election. The alleged release follows ten rounds of prisoner &#x201C;pardons&#x201D; by Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, which started in July 2024 in the run up to the 2025 presidential elections. The pardons have been dismissed as window-dressing by exiled Lukashenko opponents: while 293 prisoners have been released, the number of political prisoners remains firmly fixed at 1,250 individuals in custody because political arrests are continuing in Belarus. Without providing details of the release, Rubio claimed in a post on X that U.S. citizen Anastasia Nuhfer was now free.. It remains unclear how the release was organized and if any concessions were made to achieve it. Speaking at a press conference on election day, Lukashenko claimed that by releasing political prisoners, he was not seeking to repair relations with the West. However, he also claimed to be in direct negotiations with &#x201C;the United States and others&#x201D; on the matter of political prisoners. The U.S. State Department later confirmed to the Associated Press that Nuhfer had been detained in early December 2024. Former top-ranking Belarusian diplomats anonymously told the AP that the woman was detained in connection with 2020 protests and released &#x201C;as a gesture of goodwill.&#x201D; Nuhfer has no previously known public profile and Belarusian human rights advocates have no record of such a prisoner. However, activists note that their political prisoner records are incomplete, and the real number of unjustly imprisoned is much higher, as authorities harass the relatives of the detained to prevent them from reporting detentions to human rights watchdogs. In the week before the election, Belarusian propaganda aired a series of &#x201C;interviews&#x201D; with journalists of U.S.-funded broadcaster RFE/RL, including a dual U.S.-Belarusian citizen Yuras Ziankovich &#x2013; a move that was regarded as a Belarusian opening bargaining offer for the incoming administration. None of the journalists have been reported as being among the released to date. According to the Minsk-based Viasna Human Rights Center, at least 36 foreign citizens remain jailed in Belarus on politically motivated grounds. In total, at least 75 foreigners have been subjected to persecution since 2020 in Belarus.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-lukashenko-gets-himself-reelected-for-7th-consecutive-term/	2025-01-31T05:52:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2195442577.jpg
Norway detains Russian-crewed vessel over undersea cable damage suspicion	Norwegian authorities detained the Silver Dania vessel with a Russian crew on Jan. 30 on suspicion of it damaging an undersea fiber-optic cable linking Latvia and Sweden, the Norwegian police announced. The vessel, which operates under the Norwegian flag and travels between St. Petersburg and Murmansk, was seized in Tromso at Latvia&apos;s request following a local court order. The police are searching the ship and questioning the crew. The damaged cable is one of several recent incidents in the Baltic Sea that are being investigated as possible acts of sabotage. The Latvian State Radio and Television Broadcasting Center (LVRTC) reported on Jan. 26 that an external impact had significantly damaged the underwater cable. While data transmission services were rerouted to alternative pathways, some users in Latvia experienced slower speeds. A previous case on Dec. 25 saw the destruction of four telecommunication cables and a power cable, with Finnish authorities suspecting a Russian &quot;shadow fleet&quot; vessel was involved. These ships are used to bypass sanctions on Russian oil exports. In response to the incidents, NATO has dispatched additional patrol ships to the region to safeguard critical infrastructure. While intelligence services in the U.S. and Europe increasingly suspect the damage may be due to maritime accidents rather than deliberate sabotage, investigations remain ongoing. Concerns over Russian hybrid warfare tactics persist, particularly as suspicious activities involving Russian-registered vessels near Denmark and Sweden continue to raise alarms in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/norway-detains-russian-crewed-vessel-over-undersea-cable-damage/	2025-01-31T05:47:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167101990.jpg
Ukraine destroys Russian command post in Kursk Oblast, General Staff claims	Ukraine&apos;s Missile and Artillery Forces struck the command post of Russia&apos;s Kursk group of forces in the Russian city of Rylsk in Kursk Oblast on Jan. 31, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. &quot;As a result of the coordinated and precision strike, (Russia&apos;s) command and control post was destroyed,&quot; the statement read. Local Russian Telegram channels also reported explosions in the Rylsk district. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The attack is part of Ukraine&apos;s broader strategy to weaken Russian operational capabilities by targeting key command centers. The General Staff emphasized that such strikes aim to reduce Russia&apos;s offensive potential. The strike follows Kyiv&apos;s limited incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, 2024, when Ukrainian forces temporarily captured about 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of Russian territory. While Ukraine has reportedly lost around half of that territory since then, fighting continues in the region. Ukraine hopes to leverage its presence in the area in potential peace negotiations. Last fall, North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast to support Russian forces in countering the Ukrainian incursion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-strike-hits-russian-command-post-in-kursk-oblast-general-staff-claims/	2025-01-31T05:35:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2151152486.jpg
Finland announces $206 million military package for Ukraine	The Finnish government has approved its 27th military aid package for Ukraine worth 198 million euros ($206 million), the Finnish Defense Ministry said on Jan. 31. This brings Finland&apos;s total defense aid provided to Ukraine since the outbreak of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022 to 2.5 billion euros ($2.6 billion). As with the previous Finnish aid packages, the content of the latest tranche is classified. &quot;This package of almost 200 million euros has been built in close cooperation with Ukraine. We are providing exactly the kind of support that will help Ukraine defend itself in an acute situation on the front,&quot; Finnish Defense Minister Antti Hakkanen said in a press release. &quot;It is up to us Europeans how Europe&apos;s security continues to develop. Securing Ukraine&apos;s independence and ability to defend itself is the most important thing right now,&quot; Hakkanen said. Finland&apos;s neighbor, Sweden, recently announced its largest military aid package for Ukraine worth over $1.2 billion, including 16 CB90 combat boats with weapons stations, a million rounds of 12.7 mm ammunition, 146 trucks, 1,500 TOW anti-tank missiles, as well as 200 AT4 anti-tank launchers. The assistance comes amid expectations that Kyiv&apos;s European partners will have to take up greater responsibility for helping Ukraine as the U.S. shifts toward &quot;America First&quot; policy under President Donald Trump.	https://kyivindependent.com/finland-announces-206-million-military-package-for-ukraine/	2025-01-31T05:18:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2064209173--1-.jpg
Arms procurement chief Bezrukova dismissed, Defense Ministry says after disputes	Maryna Bezrukova, head of Ukraine&apos;s Defense Procurement Agency (DPA), has been officially dismissed over &quot;failure to meet delivery plans and other violations,&quot; the Defense Ministry announced on Jan. 31. Her firing follows a week of escalating tensions between the ministry and the DPA. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov suspended Bezrukova on Jan. 24, appointing Arsen Zhumadilov as temporary director, despite the agency&apos;s supervisory board voting to extend her contract days earlier. The Defense Ministry cited several reasons for her removal, including alleged failure to fulfill planned deliveries for the front, poor procurement planning and delays, lack of timely communication with the General Staff, and leaks of classified information, which are reportedly expected to be investigated. Hours before her firing, Bezrukova posted on Facebook that she asked President Volodymyr Zelensky to prevent the &quot;destruction&quot; of the agency. She warned that further disruptions would harm military supplies and erode donor and partner trust. Umerov&apos;s decision to fire Bezrukova sparked backlash, as Ukrainian law grants supervisory boards the sole authority to appoint or dismiss state enterprise heads. The Anti-Corruption Action Center (ANTAC) accused the Defense Ministry of a &quot;hostile takeover,&quot; alleging it manipulated the state enterprise register to &quot;legitimize&quot; Zhumadilov&apos;s appointment. The Justice Ministry confirmed that Bezrukova was initially removed from the register as director on Jan. 25, with Zhumadilov listed as the new director. Her name was later restored, but with the designation of &quot;suspended director,&quot; while Zhumadilov remained listed as &quot;temporary director.&quot; On Jan. 27, G7 ambassadors urged a swift resolution, stressing the need to maintain uninterrupted arms procurement. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) launched an investigation on Jan. 28 into potential abuse of power by Umerov.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-defense-ministry-removes-bezrukova-amid-tensions-with-dpa/	2025-01-31T04:40:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/DSC01217.jpg
100% tariffs' — Trump vows trade war if BRICS replaces dollar as reserve currency	U.S. President Donald Trump vowed on Jan. 31 to impose 100% tariffs on BRICS countries if they attempt to use new or existing currency to replace the U.S. dollar in international trade. &quot;We are going to require a commitment from these seemingly hostile countries that they will neither create a new BRICS currency, nor back any other currency to replace the mighty U.S. dollar or, they will face 100% tariffs,&quot; Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social, repeating his threats from last year. &quot;There is no chance that BRICS will replace the U.S. dollar in international trade, or anywhere else, and any country that tries should say hello to tariffs, and goodbye to America.&quot; The BRICS group, composed of Russia, China, India, Brazil, and other nations, has been exploring ways to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. A report by the Russian Finance Ministry, the Bank of Russia, and consultancy Yakov &amp; Partners from last October proposed a &quot;multicurrency system&quot; to shield BRICS members from external pressures like sanctions. The plan includes creating centers for mutual trade in commodities such as oil, natural gas, grain, and gold. After Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. and its allies imposed heavy sanctions on Moscow, freezing Russia&apos;s foreign assets and removing major Russian banks from the SWIFT international banking system. In response, Russia sought to reduce its reliance on the dollar. BRICS members are not unified on the issue. While China supports strengthening alternative currencies, it remains cautious about adopting a common one. India, focused on domestic economic interests, is unwilling to risk trade stability with the U.S. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Oct. 18, 2024, that there are no plans to create a BRICS currency, emphasizing the need for caution. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov reiterated this after Trump&apos;s threats, claiming that BRICS is discussing new investment platforms. &quot;BRICS countries are not discussing the creation of a common currency,&quot; Peskov said. The news comes after Trump urged Russia to &quot;make a deal&quot; to end its war against Ukraine, warning of increased sanctions, tariffs, and taxes on Russian goods if no agreement is reached. BRICS expanded in 2024, admitting Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates as new members. Putin hosted a BRICS forum in Kazan in October 2024, attended by 36 world leaders, and announced plans to invite new partner countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/100-tariffs-trump-vows-trade-war-if-brics-creates-alternative-currency/	2025-01-31T04:21:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2161405262-1.jpg
Stop the destruction of the agency' — Bezrukova asks Zelensky to intervene in arms procurement dispute	Maryna Bezrukova, the head of the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA), asked President Volodymyr Zelensky to prevent the &quot;destruction&quot; of the agency, in a Facebook post on Jan. 31. Bezrukova and the Defense Ministry have been at loggerheads over the last week after Defense Minister Rustem Umerov suspended Bezrukova and appointed Arsen Zhumadilov as temporary director of the DPA on Jan. 24. His decision went against the agency&#x2019;s supervisory board that voted to extend Bezrukova&#x2019;s contract days earlier. Umerov sparked backlash with accusations that he was violating the law by overriding the supervisory board. According to Ukrainian law, supervisory boards have the authority to unilaterally hire and fire the heads of state enterprises.&quot;The essence of the problem is not just an attempt to dismiss me, but the actual destruction of the institution in violation of all possible laws and Ukraine&apos;s international obligations,&quot; Bezrukova wrote on Facebook. &quot;Further delays threaten critically important supplies to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and destroy the trust of donors and partners,&quot; she added. Addressing Zelensky, Bezrukova said the agency had stopped work because of the dispute. She requested he intervene to resolve the conflict legally, prevent the agency&#x2019;s destruction, and ensure the DPA&#x2019;s stable operations without &quot;pressure, blocks, and attacks.&#x201D;On Jan. 25, Bezrukova&#x2019;s name disappeared from the state enterprise register as director of the agency. Instead, Zhumadilov, who heads the State Rear Operator (DOT), was listed as the director despite his appointment only being temporary while Bezrukova undergoes an audit. Now, Bezrukova&#x2019;s name has returned to the register but she is listed as the restricted director &quot;suspended from performing official duties for the duration of the internal investigation,&quot; the Justice Ministry said on Jan. 31. Zhumadilov is listed in the register alongside Bezrukova as the &quot;temporary director&quot; while the audit is ongoing. The removal of Bezrukova from the register caught the eye of the Anti-Corruption Action Center (ANTAC), a watchdog. It believes the Defense Ministry was behind the amendment to &quot;legitimize&quot; Zhumadilov as the new director and subsequently cement the ministry&#x2019;s control of the agency.&quot;It&apos;s like a classic hostile takeover,&quot; Tetiana Shevchuk, a lawyer at ANTAC, previously told the Kyiv Independent.&quot;They just want to take over, take the governance and the management (of the agency) into their hands, and quickly do something.&quot;After the initial amendment was publicized by ANTAC on Jan. 27, Zhumadilov&#x2019;s position in the state registry was changed to &quot;temporary director.&quot; It was changed a third time on Jan. 29 to again list Bezrukova as the director after she submitted the necessary documents to the notary.The DPA and Bezrukova stress that she is the lawful director of the agency and previously told the Kyiv Independent that she would not step down from her position. On Facebook, she said that the dispute does not benefit Ukraine. &quot;We should not have any enemies except Russia,&quot; she added. On Jan. 27, ambassadors of the Group of Seven (G7) countries called for a swift resolution and urged uninterrupted continuation of weapons procurement. They also stressed the importance of adhering to governance standards.On Jan. 28, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) launched a criminal investigation into the potential abuse of power and office by Umerov.	https://kyivindependent.com/bezrukova-asks-zelensky-to-intervene-in-arms-procurement-dispute/	2025-01-31T03:57:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/DSC01187.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — Record wartime private sector investment	The following is the Jan. 29, 2025 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. Ukraine&apos;s largest private energy company, DTEK, announced plans on Jan. 22 to invest 450 million euros ($468 million) in expanding the Tyligulska Wind Power Plant near the Black Sea coast. &quot;The commitment is the largest private sector investment in Ukraine since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022 and the biggest ever private investment in Ukraine&#x2019;s energy sector,&quot; DTEK said in a press release. DTEK, owned by Ukraine&#x2019;s richest man Rinat Akhmetov, said it had reached a deal with lenders to purchase 64 wind turbines from Danish manufacturer Vestas, a world leader in turbine production. Of the 450-million-euro investment, 370 million euros ($385 million) will be financed through bank loans guaranteed by Denmark&apos;s state-owned Export and Investment Fund (EIFO), with the remainder funded by DTEK. The project is expected to be completed by late 2026 and generate 1.7 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity annually, enough to power 900,000 Ukrainian homes. The big picture: DTEK lost nearly 90% of its generation capacity in 2024 due to Russia&apos;s aerial attacks targeting Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure. Wind turbines are harder to target than DTEK&#x2019;s large thermal power generation plants. The company has also largely been shut out from financing from large institutional investors wary of its owner, Akhmetov. EIFO lending to DTEK could be a signal to other would-be investors. Uklon is Ukraine&#x2019;s leader in the ride-hailing market (Uklon press service)A big sale in the makingKyivstar &#x2014; Ukraine&#x2019;s leading mobile operator that&#x2019;s been in the news lately over its parent company VEON&#x2019;s plans to list Kyivstar on Nasdaq &#x2014; is looking to buy Ukraine&#x2019;s favorite ride-hailing service Uklon. Forbes Ukraine reported on Jan. 27 that Kyivstar had filed an application with Ukraine&#x2019;s antitrust regulator to purchase Uklon. The deal could be valued at anywhere from $40&#x2013;80 million, according to Forbes&#x2019;s analysis. What&#x2019;s in it for the two companies? Uklon has had trouble expanding into other markets, unable to compete with ride-hailing giants like Uber and Bolt. The company launched in Georgia, Moldova, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan, but exited each market except for Uzbekistan. Veon, Kyivstar&#x2019;s parent company, has capital, expertise, and access to other markets where it also operates, one market insider told Forbes. The company also owns mobile operators in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Uklon ended the first three quarters with Hr 1.2 billion in revenue, or $28 million, twice as much for the same period of 2023.

(Okondrat/Wikipedia)Back on the market?After being nationalized at the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion over their Russian ownership, Ukraine is preparing to sell Sense Bank and Ukrnafta, Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko told Forbes Ukraine in an interview published last week. &#x201C;We are ready to privatize Sense Bank, as well as consider the possibility of selling a stake in Ukrnafta, which is in dire need of modernization,&#x201D; Svyrydenko said. Discussions on Ukrnafta are still in their infancy, she said. The Ukrainian government took control of Sense Bank in the summer of 2023 after its owner, Mikhail Fridman, was placed under sanctions in response to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Ukraine&#x2019;s government nationalized oil producer Ukrnafta in November 2022, seizing it from its shareholders, infamous oligarch and former PrivatBank owner Ihor Kolomoisky and his business partner Hennadiy Boholyubov. What&#x2019;s next? It&#x2019;s unclear. Selling Ukrnafta&#x2019;s stakes or Sense Bank quickly is another story, as there are no reported serious buyers. Privatization has also been a historically slow process in Ukraine, where many of the country&#x2019;s biggest banks are state-owned, and also in &#x201C;dire need&#x201D; of being privatized. Wesley Jordan, Chief Executive Officer of VisionFund Ukraine. (VisionFund Ukraine)Foreign investor spotlightUkraine&#x2019;s Central Bank gave the green light to VisionFund Ukraine to operate as a non-bank financial institution, allowing it to start lending in the country, the company said in a statement last week. VisionFund Ukraine is part of the global VisionFund network, which provides financial inclusion services in 28 countries across four continents, including loans, savings, insurance, and financial education. Over the past 21 years, VisionFund has lent $12.2 billion through 21.5 million loans. It works mostly with small businesses and entrepreneurs, especially in rural areas. &quot;I look forward to working with entrepreneurs and partners in the financial inclusion ecosystem. We plan to enhance entrepreneurship in Ukraine by financing small businesses to support economic recovery and capacity building of communities and help families achieve financial stability,&quot; said Wesley Jordan, Chief Executive Officer of VisionFund Ukraine. &#x201C;We start now as we understand how important fast recovery is and how timely and vital access to capital and inclusive finance is for small businesses in Ukraine,&#x201D; he added. The big picture: Small and medium-sized businesses are the backbone of Ukraine&#x2019;s economy. But access to capital to grow businesses in Ukraine, where borrowing money is expensive, remains a big barrier for many entrepreneurs. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky speaks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 21, 2025. (Fabrice Coffrini / AFP via Getty Images)Davos DigestThe World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland is over and it&#x2019;s safe to say that in addition to the inauguration of Donald Trump, Ukraine captured a lot of the spotlight this year as talks to end the war gain momentum. An end to the fighting could usher in a gold rush of investment into Ukraine, piquing the interest &#x2014; or at least curiosity &#x2014; of foreign investors. The Kyiv Independent has lots of interesting insights from the forum this year, including an op-ed from Ukraine&#x2019;s Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko, and an interview with Ukraine House Davos&#x2019;s director, Ulyana Khromyak. 3 key takeaways from Davos from Ukraine&#x2019;s economy minister &#x2018;An opportunity, not a burden:&#x2019; Ukraine House Davos&#x2019;s message for world leaders, investors Davos heard Ukraine&#x2019;s call, but will Europe seize the opportunity? Steel pipe and railway wheel producer Interpipe, owned by Ukrainian oligarch Viktor Pinchuk, has invested $16 million in the development of its assets and new equipment at the plant in Nikopol, Oleksandr Garkavy, director of the Interpipe railway products division said in Davos. Russian forces are located just across the Dnipro River from Nikopol and the city is subject to near-daily attacks. MHP wrote on its official Facebook page on Jan. 22 that the hack brought down its IT infrastructure, affecting shipments. The company is Ukraine&#x2019;s largest poultry producer, has over 30,000 employees, and finished 2023 with a revenue of over $3 billion. The hack follows a large-scale Russian hack on Ukrainian government databases in December of last year. Ukraine&#x2019;s leading private postal service Nova Poshta also reported that it delivered 19 million international parcels, an 86% increase from the year before, as it continues its expansion across the European continent. The company recently announced it had opened its first branch in Manchester, England, adding to its two London locations in the country. Nova Poshta, known abroad as Nova Post, is now active in 15 countries in Europe. &quot;In order to maintain the stability of the foreign exchange market, keep expectations under control, and gradually bring inflation to the 5% target on the policy horizon, the (central bank) board decided to raise the key policy rate by 1% to 14.5%,&quot; the bank&apos;s Chairman Andrii Pyshnyi said in a press briefing on Jan. 24. Air raid alerts warning of Russian attacks in Ukraine by oblast, with the exception of the city of Kyiv, which has its own alerts separate from Kyiv Oblast, &#x201C;leads to unjustified work interruptions even when there is no immediate threat in the area where the business is located,&#x201D; the European Business Association said. According to the association&apos;s members, downtime at enterprises can reach up to 50% of working time, causing disruptions to production plans and increased operating costs, undermining export capabilities. It&#x2019;s unclear how Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force would even be able to change the alert system to target specific regions instead of entire oblasts.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-business-roundup-largest-wartime-private-sector-investment/	2025-01-31T03:53:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/_19R5572.jpeg
China is Russia's sole supplier of key military-use rare metals amid sanctions, RFE/RL reports	China became Russia&apos;s sole supplier of gallium, germanium, and stibium, chemical substances needed to produce weapons, including nuclear ones, after the introduction of EU and U.S. sanctions in 2022, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&apos;s (RFE/RL) Schemes&apos; investigation said on Jan. 30. Ukraine&apos;s Western partners have imposed heavy sanctions against Russia after the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022 to cut off key supply lines of the Russian defense industry. As Russia&apos;s options to purchase gallium and germanium from around the world almost disappeared, China became the sole supplier in 2023, the investigation said, citing leaked data from Russian customs databases. Stibium is reportedly supplied to Russia only from China and the United Arab Emirates, two countries that are not part of the sanctions coalition. Beijing repeatedly denied supplying components for Russian military production, but the investigation revealed links between Chinese state-owned companies and Russian enterprises working for the Russian army. Of the nearly 20 Chinese companies exporting these metals to Russia, one-third are state-owned. One of the key suppliers of germanium is the Chinese Yunnan Lincang Xinyuan Germanium Industry, in which Bao Wendong, a member of the Chinese Communist Party, holds a share of ownership. The rest of the shares are held by companies with state capital, Schemes wrote. Its products are reportedly purchased by companies affiliated with Rostec, the Russian state-owned arms manufacturer, including factories that produce optical systems for military equipment. Vital Technology Group is another Chinese company that supplies gallium, germanium, and stibium. Russia&apos;s Ferrotek Nord purchases its products, which in turn cooperates with Angstrom, a supplier of microchips to the Russian Defense Ministry. Chinese gallium is also used in the production of nuclear weapons, as this metal stabilizes plutonium bombs. Russia&apos;s Kurchatov Institute, which is engaged in nuclear development, has been purchasing products containing gallium through Cryotrade Engineering. According to the investigation, the company buys gallium from the Chinese Hynhe Technology Co. Ltd. China has deepened its ties with Russia since the start of the Kremlin&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine and has become Moscow&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry. Beijing has also sough to position itself as a mediator between Russia and Ukraine, sending envoy Li Hui on multiple rounds of shuttle diplomacy in Europe. At the same time, China has criticized the U.S. and its allies for &quot;exacerbating&quot; the war by supplying arms to Ukraine, while NATO has named Beijing a &quot;decisive enabler&quot; of Russia&apos;s war.	https://kyivindependent.com/china-providing-rare-metals-to-russia-media-says/	2025-01-31T03:39:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2153185709.jpg
North Korean troops not seen for 3 weeks in parts of Kursk Oblast, Ukraine’s Special Forces say	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. North Korean troops have not been seen for roughly three weeks in the areas of Kursk Oblast where Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces (SOF) are fighting, the unit&apos;s spokesperson, Colonel Oleksandr Kindratenko, told the Kyiv Independent on Jan. 31. The comment comes as undisclosed Ukrainian and U.S. officials told The New York Times that North Korean troops had been taken off the front lines after suffering heavy casualties. &quot;These are standard measures &#x2013; rotation due to large casualties,&quot; a military intelligence source commented for the Kyiv Independent, confirming the reports.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-not-seen-for-3-weeks-in-parts-of-kursk-oblast-ukraines-special-forces-say/	2025-01-31T03:02:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1125139920.jpg
Ukrainian drones strike 'one of 10 largest oil refineries in Russia,' military says	Ukrainian drones attacked an oil refinery owned by Lukoil, one of Russia&apos;s largest oil producers, in Volgograd Oblast overnight on Jan. 31, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. &quot;This refinery is one of the 10 largest oil refineries in Russia in terms of design capacity and is involved in supplying the Russian occupation army,&quot; the General Staff said in a statement. The Lukoil-Volgogradneftepererabotka refinery was targeted in a joint operation of the Unmanned Systems Forces and Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR). It lies around 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the front line in Ukraine. Flashes and explosions were recorded near the plant, though the extent of the damage is still being assessed, the military said. The Lukoil refinery in Volgograd Oblast has been targeted multiple times during the war, including in February, July, and September 2023. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its air defenses shot down 49 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 25 in Rostov Oblast, eight in Volgograd Oblast, six in Kursk Oblast, and four in Yaroslav Oblast. Two drones each were reportedly destroyed over Krasnodar Krai, Voronezh, and Belgorod oblasts. Ukraine has increasingly targeted Russian energy infrastructure, including oil refineries and fuel depots, to disrupt supplies to Russian forces. The strikes are part of a broader strategy to weaken Russia&apos;s military logistics and economic resilience amid the ongoing war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-strike-russian-oil-refinery-in-volgograd-oblast-targeting-lukoil-facility/	2025-01-31T02:40:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-31_07-38-21-2.jpg
EU denies any links between Russian gas purchases, Ukraine peace talks	The European Union is rejecting any connection between the possibility of resuming Russian pipeline gas purchases and peace talks on ending the Russia-Ukraine war, European Commission Chief Spokesperson Paula Pinho said on Jan. 30 during a press briefing. Earlier the same day, the Financial Times (FT) reported that EU officials are discussing the possibility of resuming purchases of Russian pipeline gas as part of a potential settlement of Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. Proponents of the proposal, including Hungarian and German officials, argued that the move could give Russia and Europe incentives to maintain a peace agreement while stabilizing the continent&apos;s energy market, according to the FT. &quot;We are not making any links to peace talks for the moment. The line has been set on this. Whenever we have such talks when that moment comes, it will be with Ukraine,&quot; Pinho said. &quot;We do not confirm any links reported in the article this morning about any links between the transit of gas through Ukraine and any peace talks,&quot; she added. Before the full-scale war, Russian pipeline gas represented roughly 40% of the EU&apos;s overall purchases, with Germany being the chief buyer. The European Commission aims to eliminate Russian fossil fuels from the European Union&apos;s energy market by 2027. Despite the almost complete halt of Russian pipeline gas flowing to the EU, European countries have ramped up purchases of Russia&apos;s liquified natural gas (LNG) in 2024. Previously, Ukraine ended the transit of Russian gas to Europe on Jan. 1, following the end of the contract. Some EU countries, including Hungary and Slovakia, still rely on Russian gas in their energy system. Following Ukraine&apos;s termination of Russian gas transportation through its territory, gas prices in Europe rose by 4.3% to almost 51 euros per megawatt-hour. This rise is the highest since October 2023 and comes ahead of freezing temperatures forecast across much of Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-denies-any-ties-between-russian-gas-purchases-and-peace-talks-over-war-in-ukraine/	2025-01-31T01:57:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2189498561.jpg
Dishonest' to suggest Ukraine could have fully defeated Russia, retake Crimea, Rubio says	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio denounced Moscow&apos;s aggression in Ukraine but said it was &quot;dishonest&quot; to claim Kyiv was capable of destroying Russia on the battlefield and returning to the pre-2014 state of affairs, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview published on Jan. 30. The U.S. official acknowledged that Russian President Vladimir Putin carried out &#xA0;&quot;atrocities&quot; and &quot;horrible things&quot; as part of his invasion of Ukraine but voiced doubts about Kyiv&apos;s prospects for a complete military victory. &quot;But what the dishonesty that has existed is that we somehow led people to believe that Ukraine would be able, not just to defeat Russia, but destroy (Putin), push him all the way back to what the world looked like in 2012 or 2014 before the Russians took Crimea,&quot; Rubio said on the Megyn Kelly Show. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized the Biden administration for funneling extensive support to Ukraine and pledged to broker a swift peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow. Echoing these sentiments, Trump&apos;s secretary of state said that the U.S. has been &quot;fund(ing) a stalemate&quot; in a war that &quot;set (Ukraine) back 100 years&quot; and called for a swift resolution. &quot;The energy grid is being wiped out. Someone&apos;s going to have to pay for all this reconstruction. And how many Ukrainians have left Ukraine (and are) living in other countries now? They may never return,&quot; Rubio said. Russia has carried out a sustained missile and drone campaign against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure throughout the full-scale war, leading to blackouts and power deficits. Over 6 million Ukrainians have fled the country after the start of the invasion. &quot;The nation&#x2019;s future hangs in the balance in this regard,&quot; the U.S. official added. Rubio reiterated his earlier statements that &quot;both sides of the conflict will need to make compromises&quot; for successful negotiations. Earlier this month, Rubio paused almost all foreign assistance flowing through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), presenting a significant challenge to various civilian programs in Ukraine that rely on U.S. support, including in the energy sector. Kyiv and the Pentagon said this order did not affect the U.S. military support for Ukraine. Criticizing the previous Biden administration, Rubio also suggested that the U.S.&apos;s &quot;chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan&quot; in 2021 was a signal to Putin that &quot;America was actually in decline or distracted,&quot; leading to the decision to launch the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/dishonest-to-suggest-ukraine-could-have-fully-defeated-russia-retake-crimea-rubio-says/	2025-01-31T01:35:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194528244.jpg
Explosion at Rheinmetall plant in Spain leaves 6 injured	Six people were injured in an explosion at a warehouse of the German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall plant in Murcia, Spain, the Spanish news agency EFE reported on Jan. 30, citing local emergency services. The explosion occurred at 4:20 p.m. local time on Jan. 30, starting a large fire that spread to about 2,000 square meters but was subsequently extinguished. Six people were injured, one of whom is in serious condition, according to officials. The cause of the blast is currently under investigation, Spanish authorities said. The incident was not the first to result in casualties at the Spanish plant. Two workers suffered severe burns due to a solvent fire a year ago, according to EFE. Rheinmetall is one of the largest arms manufacturers in Europe. The company provides weapons, ammunition, and equipment to Ukraine under contracts with the German government, such as 155 mm artillery rounds, Leopard 1 tanks, mortar shells, and drone surveillance systems, among other weapons. Rheinmetall also opened a military vehicle repair facility in Ukraine in June 2024, the first of four plants it plans to open in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/6-people-suffer-injuries-in-explosion-at-rheinmetall-plant-in-spain/	2025-01-31T00:13:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2196806773.jpg
1 killed, 35 injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks across Ukrainian oblasts killed at least one civilian and injured at least 35, including children, regional authorities reported on Jan. 31. Russia launched 102 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Fifty-nine drones were shot down over 12 oblasts, while 37 were lost in the airspace without causing damage, according to the statement. Three people were injured during Russian attacks against Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Governor Serhii Lysak said.

No casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-123/	2025-01-30T23:42:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-30_18-42-06.jpg
Ukrainian drones set fire to Russian oil refinery in Volgograd Oblast, authorities say	Ukrainian drones attacked Russia&apos;s Volgograd Oblast overnight on Jan. 31, targeting an oil refinery owned by Lukoil, one of the largest Russian oil producers, Governor Andrey Bocharov said. The wreckage of a downed drone fell on the refinery, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished, the governor of the southwestern Russian region claimed. According to Bocharov, one employee was injured and hospitalized. Russian air defenses shot down 49 Ukrainian drones throughout the night, according to Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry. Russian forces downed 25 drones in Rostov Oblast, eight in Volgograd Oblast, six in Kursk Oblast, and four in Yaroslav Oblast. Two drones each were destroyed over Krasnodar Krai, Voronezh, and Belgorod oblasts. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage that purports to show explosions during a Ukrainian drone attack against Volgograd Oblast, Russia, overnight on Jan. 31, 2025.

In Voronezh Oblast, one of the drones fell on a car passing on the highway, injuring the driver, Governor Alexander Gusev said. In Voronezh, a drone reportedly inflicted minor damage to an industrial enterprise. Drone debris broke electrical wires in Rostov Oblast, while no damage or casualties were recorded in Yaroslav Oblast. The authorities of Krasnodar Krai, Kursk, and Belgorod oblasts have not yet commented on the attack. The Ukrainian military has not yet commented on the strikes. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims. Ukraine regularly targets Russian oil facilities with long-range drone strikes, aiming to disrupt fuel supplies to the Russian military and reduce Moscow&apos;s energy export revenues. Oil profits are a crucial source of funding for Russia&apos;s war chest.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-attack-oil-refinery-in-russias-volgograd-oblast/	2025-01-30T23:30:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-629598103.jpg
Suspected US-to-Russia weapons trafficker arrested in Kyrgyzstan	Kyrgyz law enforcement officers arrested a suspected arms trafficker linked to a criminal group smuggling weapons from the U.S. to Russia, according to a statement released by Kyrgyzstan&apos;s security agency, the State Committee for National Security, on Jan. 30. The criminal group reportedly began transporting weapons in April 2022, shortly after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion began. Authorities caught the suspect while he was receiving a package containing firearm parts, according to the statement. The organization, consisting of Kyrgyz, Russian, and American citizens, allegedly trafficked over 300 weapons, including Glock pistols and AR-15 rifles. The State Committee for National Security said that the network was &quot;uncovered and dismantled&quot; and that it involved smuggling firearms, ammunition, and military gear from the U.S. to Russia via Kyrgyzstan.	https://kyivindependent.com/suspected-us-to-russia-weapons-trafficker-arrested-in-kyrgyzstan/	2025-01-30T22:31:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1164184182.jpg

Russia blocked 417000 websites in 2024, media reports	In 2024, Russian authorities blocked 417,000 websites, the Russian independent news outlet Verstka reported. Verstka analyzed data from the internet freedom NGO Roskomsvoboda. 523,000 websites were blocked the year before in 2023, but access was later restored to approximately 106,000 of those. The Federal Tax Service led the crackdown with 142,400 bans, followed by Roskomnadzor, Russia&apos;s communications regulator, with over 132,000. An unnamed government agency, believed to be linked to the Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office, was responsible for 62,100 restrictions. 85.5% of these bans were imposed extrajudicially, with various agencies censoring content on topics like LGBTQ+ issues, military criticism, gambling, and piracy. Since March 2024, VPN services have also increasingly become a target, with Roskomnadzor increasing efforts to block them and suppress information on bypassing restrictions. Russian authorities ramped up their crackdown on political opposition following the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Voicing discontent with Russia&apos;s war or Russian authorities can lead to heavy penalties. Russia has used claims of &quot;extremism&quot; to crack down on a wide range of organizations, news outlets, and social media platforms.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-blocked-417000-websites-in-2024-media-reports/	2025-01-30T20:45:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1135694093.jpg
Ukrainian military intelligence disrupts Gazprom's digital services	Cyber specialists from Ukraine&#x2019;s Military Intelligence Agency (HUR) launched a cyber attack against Gazprom and Gazpromneft on Jan. 29, Hromadske reported, citing undisclosed sources from HUR. The group carried out a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, severely disrupting Gazprom&#x2019;s digital services. This operation was symbolically carried out on Jan. 29 which is the anniversary of the Battle of Kruty, where Ukrainian cadets and volunteers fought against the Bolshevik advance in 1918. As about 5,000 Bolshevik troops came to seize Kyiv, a young student battalion of about 500 students dug trenches near the city and courageously faced them in an unequal fight. &#x201C;Today&#x2019;s troubles for Russian drivers are a message from our brothers of 1918, the heroes of the battle at Kruty, who over a century ago dealt a blow to the criminal Russian forces under Muravyov. Today, we continue the fight of those defenders of Kyiv, both on the front lines and in cyberspace,&#x201D; HUR stated. The attack targeted critical online systems, and as a result, customers have been unable to access accounts, process fuel payments, or use other digital services since January 28. Gazprom referred to the incident as a &#x201C;temporary technical glitch&#x201D; without offering details or a resolution timeline. Cyberattacks have been widely used by both Ukraine and Russia during the full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-military-intelligence-disrupts-gazproms-digital-services/	2025-01-30T18:59:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1238523443.jpg
IAEA chief to visit Kyiv next week	Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), will visit Kyiv on Feb. 4 to hold high-level meetings on preventing nuclear accidents during wartime. The IAEA serves as the nuclear safety watchdog for the United Nations. The agency has had a rotating mission at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant since September 2022. The visit marks Grossi&apos;s 11th mission to Ukraine since the launch of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, the IAEA said in a statement on Jan. 30. &quot;As long as this horrific war continues, the IAEA will remain present and stay active, focused on doing everything we can to support nuclear safety and security in extremely challenging circumstances,&quot; Grossi said. &quot;As the overall situation is still precarious and fragile, our work there remains essential.&quot; Ukraine relies on nuclear power for more than half of its energy production, which is increasingly in demand as Russian attacks pummel Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure. The IAEA sent teams of experts to monitor other nuclear facilities in Ukraine in mid-December 2024, amid Russia&apos;s large-scale attacks on the country&apos;s power grid. In addition to the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, monitors are currently based at the Khmelnytskyi, Rivne, South Ukraine, and Chornobyl nuclear plants. The agency has warned that military activity near the sites, particularly in Zaporizhzhia, increases the risk of nuclear disaster. According to the IAEA&apos;s report on Jan. 30, a power line at the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant was disconnected on Jan. 29 due to &quot;unspecified military activity.&quot; Other facilities in Ukrainian-controlled territory were affected by air raid alerts and nearby drones. At the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the IAEA teams reported daily explosions but no damage to the plant itself. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/iaea-chief-to-visit-kyiv-next-week/	2025-01-30T16:46:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1673593890.jpg
Tulsi Gabbard 'offended' by question about pro-Russian sympathies at Senate hearing	Tulsi Gabbard, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s nominee for national intelligence director, fielded questions about her record on foreign affairs and past statements about Russia during her Senate confirmation hearing on Jan. 30. Gabbard has previously repeated Kremlin talking points justifying the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden Admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia&apos;s legitimate security concerns,&quot; she wrote on &#xA0;X at the start of the invasion. During her hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Republican Senator Jerry Moran asked Gabbard if Russia would &quot;get a pass&quot; from her in light of her past statements. &quot;Senator, I&apos;m offended by the question,&quot; Gabbard said. &quot;Because my sole focus, commitment and responsibility is about our own nation, our own security, and the interests of the American people. No country, group, or individual will get a pass.&quot; When asked who she blamed for the war in Ukraine, Gabbard backtracked on her prior remarks about NATO and U.S. President Joe Biden. &#xA0; &quot;(Russian President Vladimir) Putin started the war in Ukraine,&quot; she said. Gabbard also dismissed claims that she helped amplify pro-Russian viewpoints. &quot;I don&apos;t pay attention to Russian propaganda,&quot; she said. Senators also grilled Gabbard on her controversial 2017 meeting with former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, a visit that sparked outrage from both Republicans and Democrats. The Russian-backed regime was accused of human rights violations, including the use of illegal chemical weapons. &quot;I just do not understand how you can blame NATO for Putin&apos;s brutal invasion of Ukraine, and when Assad used chemical weapons against his own people, you didn&apos;t condemn him,&quot; said Senator Mark Warner, the committee&apos;s senior Democrat. Gabbard defended the meeting with Assad, saying it was an opportunity to ask &quot;tough questions.&quot; Gabbard is a National Guard veteran and former Democratic congressmember who left the party in 2022 and began campaigning alongside Trump. She has no formal intelligence experience and has never led a government department or agency. Trump has prized loyalty over expertise in building his administration, and has begun purging the federal government of independent personnel.	https://kyivindependent.com/tulsi-gabbard-offended-by-question-about-pro-russian-sympathies-at-senate-hearing/	2025-01-30T15:46:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2196786617.jpg
Oil shipments on pause at Russia's Ust-Luga port after drone strike, Bloomberg reports	Oil flows via Russia&apos;s Ust-Luga port in the Baltic Sea appear to have paused in the aftermath of an alleged Ukrainian drone attack, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 30, citing shipping data and a source with knowledge of the oil deliveries. A a source in the Security Service of Ukraine told the Kyiv Independent that Ukraine hit the Andreapol oil pumping station in Russia&apos;s Tver Oblast with drones overnight on Jan. 29. &quot;The Russians even had to shut down the main pipeline that supplies oil to the Ust-Luga terminal in Leningrad Oblast,&quot; the source said. A drop in shipping activity at the port appears to back up these claims, according to Bloomberg. Oil deliveries from Ust-Luga fell to zero on Jan. 29, a source with knowledge of the shipments said. Shipping data indicates that a vessel left the port early on Jan. 29, but shows a gap thereafter. Bloomberg&apos;s source did not provide a reason for the sudden decline. The Andreapol pumping station is part of the Baltic Pipeline System-2, operated by Russian state-owned oil pipeline company Transneft. Its pipeline network supplies oil to the Ust-Luga port. The port processed about 650,000 barrels crude per day in 2024, representing approximately 20% of Russia&apos;s total seaborne crude supply, according to Bloomberg. Ukraine regularly targets Russian oil facilities with long-range drone strikes, aiming to disrupt fuel supplies to the Russian military and reduce Moscow&apos;s energy export revenues. Oil profits are a crucial source of funding for Russia&apos;s war chest.	https://kyivindependent.com/oil-stops-flowing-via-russias-ust-luga-port-after-drone-strike-bloomberg-reports/	2025-01-30T13:38:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1238944260.jpg
Ukraine war latest: 9 killed, 13 injured in Russian drone attack on Sumy	Key developments on Jan. 30: A Russian drone struck a residential building in the northeastern city of Sumy overnight on Jan. 30, killing nine people and injuring 13 others, the Interior Ministry reported. Search and rescue operations at the site of the Russian attack concluded later in the evening. Russia launched a total of 81 attack and decoy drones against Ukraine on the night of Jan. 30, the Air Force reported. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down 37 of them, while 39 more disappeared from radars before reaching targets. A Shahed-type attack drone hit the multistory building in Sumy shortly after midnight local time, Governor Volodymyr Artiukh said. Two couples were killed in the attack: A 74-year-old man and his 69-year-old wife and a 65-year-old man and a 64-year-old woman, local authorities reported. Some of the injured victims have been hospitalized and are reported to be in serious condition. Among the injured are an eight-year-old child and an 18-year-old man. Videos posted of the attack show significant damage to the building, seemingly between the sixth and seventh floors of the building. Authorities later said that 12 balconies were destroyed in the attack. Sweden will provide Ukraine with a military aid package worth over $1.2 billion, Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson announced on Jan. 30. It is Sweden&apos;s largest tranche of military assistance since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, according to Johnson. The package includes 16 CB90 combat boats with weapons stations, a million rounds of 12.7 mm ammunition, 146 trucks, 1,500 TOW anti-tank missiles, as well as 200 AT4 anti-tank launchers. About $90 million will be allocated for the production of long-range missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles, Johnson said. Donations from the Swedish Armed Forces&apos; stockpiles will account for roughly 25% of the package, while around 45% will be used for investment in defense production. &quot;This can be directed towards prioritized needs, such as artillery, long-range strike abilities and drones. A short delivery time is important,&quot; the minister said. Under the new package, $178 million will be allocated for the so-called Danish model of funding for Ukraine&apos;s defense production. Other funds will also be allocated for the training of Ukrainian soldiers in 2025, as well as the repair and maintenance of the equipment already donated by Sweden. Lithuania will likely consider deploying military personnel to Ukraine for a potential peacekeeping mission, Lithuanian Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Raimundas Vaiksnoras said on Jan. 30, according to the LRT broadcaster. &quot;If you ask whether Lithuania could (send peacekeepers to Ukraine), yes, we will probably consider it. There will be a discussion, and I think we should also take responsibility for European stability,&quot; Vaiksnoras told the Ziniu radio. His remarks come amid ongoing discussions among Western countries about the possible deployment of peacekeeping forces to Ukraine if a ceasefire is agreed upon with Russia. Earlier reports from The Wall Street Journal indicated that U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s team is weighing a plan to delay Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for continued Western arms supplies and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said on Jan. 18 that Germany may consider contributing forces to such a mission, while U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed on Jan. 16 that he had discussed the matter with President Volodymyr Zelensky. Moscow has strongly opposed the idea. Russia has depleted much of its Soviet-era military-industrial stockpile, with remaining equipment in poor condition, independent media outlet The Insider reported on Jan. 28. The Russian military has lost more than half of its available equipment, and unless an unexpected shift occurs, hostilities could gradually fade by late 2025 or early 2026 due to a shortage of tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery, the publication claims. The Insider reported that both Russian and Ukrainian forces are primarily losing Soviet-era equipment, with Russian losses now accounting for about 50% of its total stock. Much of the remaining equipment in storage is in poor technical condition, making it unlikely to be repaired and deployed to the front lines. The number of combat-ready vehicles Russia could still send to the front is estimated at around 2,000 tanks, 2,000 infantry fighting vehicles (BMPs), and 3,000 armored personnel carriers (APCs). Moscow is also reportedly facing production limitations. The only infantry fighting vehicle in large-scale production remains the BMP-3, with 463 units produced in 2023. Modern BTR-82 armored personnel carrier production is estimated at 300&#x2013;400 units annually.

Russian drone strike in Pokrovsk injures 3, including British volunteer	A Russian drone attack in Pokrovsk struck an evacuation vehicle on Jan. 30, injuring the driver and two passengers, the Donetsk Oblast Prosecutor&apos;s Office reported. The Kyiv Independent has confirmed that the driver of the evacuation vehicle is a British volunteer working in Ukraine. The victims sustained mine-blast trauma and shrapnel wounds, the regional prosecutor&apos;s office said. The passengers have been identified as a 42-year-old woman and a 48-year-old man. Efforts to evacuate civilians from front-line towns in Donetsk Oblast have intensified as Russian forces continue to advance in eastern Ukraine. Pokrovsk, one of the region&apos;s most embattled cities, came under mandatory evacuation orders in summer 2024. Civilian evacuations near Pokrovsk are high-risk endeavors due to constant shelling and the proximity of Russian troops. &#xA0; According to a recent analysis by the monitoring group DeepState, Russian forces are concentrating 44% of their attacks in the Pokrovsk sector. The city is a vital logistics hub for Ukrainian troops in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-strike-in-pokrovsk-injures-3-including-british-volunteer/	2025-01-30T12:42:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/pokrovskdrone.jpg
Ukraine's Defense Procurement Agency says Bezrukova is still director after her name disappeared from state register	Maryna Bezrukova has overturned the decision to remove her name from the state enterprise register as director of the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA), the agency said on Jan. 30. The DPA once again emphasized that legally, Bezrukova remains the head of the agency as her contract was extended by the supervisory board, despite the Defense Ministry&apos;s attempt to override the decision. The question of Bezrukova&apos;s contract extension has grown into one of the biggest wartime scandals in Ukraine, with activists saying that the Defense Ministry&apos;s actions are underminig Ukraine&apos;s crucial defense procurement reform. On Jan. 24, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced that he decided to suspend Bezrukova and appoint Arsen Zhumadilov, head of the State Rear Operator (DOT), as her replacement, overriding the DPA&apos;s supervisory board. DOT is another state agency tasked with providing non-lethal defense procurement.On Jan. 25, Bezrukova&apos;s name was removed from a state register and replaced by Zhumadilov.&quot;Bezrukova has been the acting director of the Defense Procurement Agency since February 1, 2024. These powers have not been terminated,&quot; the agency wrote on Jan. 30, confirming that Bezrukova&apos;s name has returned to the register. The ministry only temporarily suspended Bezrukova while she undergoes an audit, following Umerov&#x2019;s allegations that the agency&#x2019;s results were poor. Therefore, the amendments to the register replacing her with Zhumadilov are unlawful, said Vitaliy Shabunin, co-founder of the Anti-Corruption Action Center (ANTAC).After the initial amendment was publicized by ANTAC on Jan. 27, Zhumadilov&#x2019;s position in the state registry was changed to &quot;temporary director.&quot; It was changed a third time on Jan. 29, to again list Bezrukova as the director after she submitted the necessary documents to the notary.Although officially it is not known who ordered the change, ANTAC believes it to be the Defense Ministry alongside the controversial Head of the President&apos;s Office Andriy Yermak to &#x201C;legitimize&#x201D; Zhumadilov as the new director and subsequently cement the ministry&#x2019;s control of the agency. &#x201C;It&apos;s like a classic hostile takeover,&#x201D; Tetiana Shevchuk, a lawyer at ANTAC, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;They just want to take over, take the governance and the management (of the agency) into their hands, and quickly do something.&#x201D; Shabunin noted that the private notary agent, Andriy Lihun, who signed the changes on Jan. 25 is a volunteer of the NGO &quot;Union of TV and Film Industry Entrepreneurs,&quot; founded by Yermak, a former film producer. The latter may be the force behind the change, Shabunin said on Facebook.Due to the DPA&#x2019;s vast budget, over $7 billion annually, Yermak likely wants to influence the agency, Shevchuk told the Kyiv Independent. The Kyiv Independent reached out to Yermak and the Defense Ministry but did not receive a response at the time of publication. Umerov&#x2019;s decision to override the DPA supervisory board&apos;s vote sparked accusations of unlawful behavior and calls for his removal. According to Ukrainian law, supervisory boards have the authority to unilaterally hire and fire the heads of state enterprises. Bezrukova previously told the Kyiv Independent that she intends to stay in her position. On Jan. 27, ambassadors of the Group of Seven (G7) countries called for a swift resolution and urged uninterrupted continuation of weapons procurement. They also stressed the importance of adhering to governance standards.On Jan. 28, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) launched a criminal investigation into the potential abuse of power and office by Umerov.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-defense-procurement-agency-says-bezrukova-is-still-director-after-her-name-disappeared-from-state-register/	2025-01-30T12:24:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/DSC01099.jpg
Kyiv Independent launches fundraiser to support Ukraine's front-line media after US aid freeze	The Kyiv Independent launched a fundraiser to support three independent local media outlets in Ukraine, whose funding was cut as a result of a 90-day pause on U.S. foreign aid ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump. The goal is to raise 40,000 pounds ($50,000) through GoFundMe. &quot;We couldn&#x2019;t just stand by and watch our colleagues and partners lose their teams and suspend their operations while independent journalism remains one of the most crucial jobs in Ukraine today, especially near the front lines,&quot; said Daryna Shevchenko, CEO of the Kyiv Independent. Trump signed an executive order on his inauguration day suspending foreign aid programs for 90 days to review whether the distribution aligned with his foreign policy. The freeze affects a number of organizations in Ukraine that provide a range of humanitarian services, often to some of the most vulnerable segments of society. A number of independent Ukrainian media outlets and its journalists who have been covering Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine for almost three years were also left without critical funding. With the advertising market collapsing because of the war and citizens focusing on donating to the army, independent Ukrainian publishers have been struggling to stay afloat and keep bringing the truth to their communities. The smaller, local media outlets were hit the hardest by the U.S. government&#x2019;s recent aid suspension. Many of them are the sole source of reliable local news for their communities. They are small teams working in difficult conditions, usually on very small salaries, driven by their loyalty to the local community. The Kyiv Independent is raising funds for three local media outlets: Tsukr from Sumy, Gwara Media from Kharkiv, and MykVisti from Mykolaiv. The Kyiv Independent has donated $10,000 (8,000 pounds) of its own money to the fundraiser, with the goal of raising a total of $50,000. This will allow the newsrooms to pay their journalists, keep the lights on, and continue their reporting. &quot;We are fortunate to be financially stable and unaffected by the U.S. aid freeze crisis&#x2014;thanks to all of you. We know where you stand, and that is behind independent journalism in Ukraine,&#x201D; &#xA0;Shevchenko said. The raised funds will be shared equally among these three media outlets, operating close to the front lines in Ukraine:	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-independent-launches-fundraiser-to-support-ukrainian-front-line-media-after-us-aid-freeze/	2025-01-30T11:32:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2182628775.jpg
Ukrainian defense tech company Huless raises over $1 million for tethered drone systems	Huless, a Ukrainian company developing tethered drone systems, secured over $1 million in private financing, loans, and a grant from Ukrainian Defense Tech cluster Brave1, the company said in a press release on Jan. 30. Huless makes the Highline-T, a drone that can operate for up to four hours at heights up to 100 meters, even without GPS signals, the company says. Unlike kamikaze or bomber drones that blow up Russian positions or vehicles, the Highline-T&#x2019;s main function is extending the range of communications. The tethered drone stays connected to the ground via a cable that provides constant power and data connection independent of interference from electronic warfare. Huless plans to use the funding to expand its market presence and develop its tethered drone technology for military communications, the company said. The drones will serve as mobile aerial antennas, improving the range and safety of military operations. The private backers include angel investors the Huless team met at Defense Tech Valley, the largest investment summit on Ukrainian defense innovations organized by Brave1. The &#x201C;investments will be directed toward creating an ecosystem of mobile military communications, where the key component will be Highline-T tethered drones developed by Huless,&#x201D; Brave1 wrote on LinkedIn. &#x201C;We are already creating technologies that no other country has. Therefore, investment in Ukrainian defense tech is a contribution to the defense capability of not only Ukraine but also NATO,&#x201D; said Mykhailo Fedorov, whose Digital Transformation Ministry heads Brave1, in a post announcing the investment.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-defense-tech-company-huless-raises-over-1-million-for-tethered-drone-systems/	2025-01-30T11:10:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/1738237883414.jpeg
Ukrainian detained in Slovakia over alleged coup plot, media reports	The police in Slovakia detained a Ukrainian citizen on Jan. 30 suspected of preparing a coup in the country, Slovak media Aktuality reported.The Ukrainian is being held in the border police office ahead of his deportation to Ukraine, according to Jana Mashkarova, the head of the Slovak police. She did not specify when the Ukrainian could be deported. The news comes as relations between Kyiv and Bratislava have become increasingly tense this month. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who maintains friendly ties with Russia, recently called President Volodymyr Zelensky an &quot;enemy&quot; of Slovakia, while Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry called Fico &quot;the Kremlin&apos;s mouthpiece&quot; in response. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry told Babel media outlet that the Ukrainian, born in 1966, is accused of &quot;threatening the national security&quot; of Slovakia. The embassy has established contact with the detainee and his family, the ministry said. Slovak opposition lawmaker Juraj Krupa suggested that the case may be trumped-up. If the detainee&apos;s intentions to organize a coup in Slovakia were true, he would not have acted alone and in a &quot;top secret manner,&quot; the lawmaker said, as quoted by Slovak media. Richard Gluck, chairman of Slovakia&apos;s Internal Security Committee who is a member of Fico&apos;s party, said that more information is expected from the country&apos;s Interior Ministry on the suspect&apos;s potential accomplices. Earlier on Jan. 30, Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry summoned Slovak Ambassador Pavel Vizdal on Jan. 30 to express its rejection of Bratislava&apos;s claims that Kyiv is interfering in Slovakia&apos;s internal affairs. A day before, the Slovak Foreign Ministry summoned Ukrainian Ambassador to Bratislava Myroslav Kastran after Kyiv criticized Fico for wanting to continue Russian gas supplies to Slovakia. Days before, Fico claimed that Ukraine was connected to a cyberattack on Slovakia&apos;s national insurance company, which Kyiv rejected. Fico, a pro-Russian politician who has long opposed military aid to Ukraine, has escalated threats against Kyiv following the termination of Russian gas transit via Ukrainian territory on Jan. 1. He has threatened to limit aid to Ukrainians and cut off electricity supplies amid an energy crisis brought on by Russia&apos;s relentless attacks against Ukraine&apos;s power grid.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-detained-in-slovakia-over-alleged-coup-plot/	2025-01-30T11:05:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-992281390.jpg
For Ukraine’s female partisans in occupation, hope lies in resistance	Somewhere in the streets of Russian-occupied Simferopol, the capital of Crimea, a woman puts a sticker on the wall. It&#x2019;s a short message, but if she is seen doing it, she will face arrest, prosecution, and likely, torture. The message is: &quot;Soon, we will be home again.&quot; On another sticker, the most dangerous three words in the occupied Crimea: &quot;This is Ukraine.&quot; What makes it even more risky for their bearer is the language. The words are in Ukrainian. The woman putting up the stickers is a member of Zla Mavka, an all-female resistance group. She is on a dangerous mission: to give hope. In the occupied territories, hope is a prized commodity. As Russia&apos;s full-scale war is about to reach its grim third anniversary, its grip over one-fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory only grew tighter. The prospects for full military liberation of the occupied regions &#x2014; including Crimea and parts of the Donbas region occupied since 2014 &#x2014; seem ever more distant. After seeing the liberation of the parts of Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Kherson oblasts in 2022, Ukrainians in other occupied areas have been hoping that their turn will come soon. Now they struggle to find comfort in the latest news. Nonetheless, Olesia, one of the three women who founded Zla Mavka, an all-women resistance movement that operates across occupied territories, including Crimea and Zaporizhzhia Oblast, says she plans to fight as long as possible. Olesia&#x2019;s name has been changed and her last name is not being disclosed to protect her identity as she lives under Russian occupation. &#x41F;&#x435;&#x440;&#x435;&#x433;&#x43B;&#x44F;&#x43D;&#x443;&#x442;&#x438; &#x446;&#x435;&#x439; &#x434;&#x43E;&#x43F;&#x438;&#x441; &#x432; Instagram &#x414;&#x43E;&#x43F;&#x438;&#x441;, &#x43F;&#x43E;&#x448;&#x438;&#x440;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x438;&#x439; Zla Mavka (@zlamavka) &quot;As long as there is hope, we will continue to resist,&quot; she told the Kyiv Independent. The name, Zla Mavka, or Evil Mavka, harkens back to old Ukrainian folklore &#x2014; the mavka is a woodland female spirit who uses its beautiful appearance to lure men to their deaths. An image of a young woman, clad in white garb and wearing a wreath of flowers, became the most iconic attribute of their imagery. Mavkas are not easy to reach. Their members never know when a Russian soldier will stop them in the street to inspect the contents of their phones. Olesia sends her answers in writing through an intermediary. Audio or video is deemed too risky. Her responses are somber and free of embellishments. &quot;If we lose, we won&apos;t have a life here,&quot; she writes. &quot;We will have to leave our homes because living under Russian occupation is worse than prison.&quot; Olesia comes from a city in southeastern Ukraine that was seized by Russia mere days after the outbreak of the full-scale war. After Moscow illegally declared the annexation of the lands they seized, hers and other cities under Russian control were to be remodeled into Potemkin villages &#x2014; a veneer of a harmonious cohabitation covering up arrests, torture, and repressions. On Women&apos;s Day on March 8, 2023 &#x2014; more than a year after the start of the occupation &#x2014; Russian troops were lined up in the city&apos;s streets to dutifully hand out flowers to Ukrainian women. The gesture had a different effect than Russia might have hoped. It was the &quot;insolence of Russian occupiers and their attitudes toward women&quot; that inspired the Zla Mavka founding, Olesia explains. &quot;We wanted to remind them that they are not at home, that this is Ukraine, and they are not welcome,&quot; she says. The trio of founders, one of whom is an artist, began distributing posters bearing an inscription in Russian reading &quot;I don&apos;t want flowers! I want my Ukraine back!&quot; and a drawing of a woman smashing a Russian soldier with a bouquet. Since these early days, the movement grew to hundreds of activists, forming a decentralized group coordinated through anonymous chatbots on a messenger app. The group spread to different occupied regions and became especially active in Crimea, with few members hailing even from Donbas. Zla Mavka may be only one of several resistance groups that sprung up in Russian-held areas, including the Yellow Ribbon and Atesh. But its all-female character and the use of humor and creativity sets it apart from others. Art created by Zla Mavka, a Ukrainian all-female resistance movement operating across Russian-occupied territories. (Zla Mavka)Creativity is the group&apos;s greatest strength, Olesia says, half-jokingly suggesting that women can be more sophisticated in the ways of resistance than their male counterparts. Among the many acts of resistance since the foundation of the group, Mavkas say they created fake ruble banknotes reminding the Russians that &quot;Crimea is Ukraine,&quot; burned Russian flags, and filled the streets with pro-Ukrainian graffiti, posters, and poetry. At times, they say they mix laxatives into food and alcohol served to Russian soldiers, a treat they mischievously dubbed the &quot;Mavka cocktail.&quot; Their activities also venture into more usual resistance activities, including the distribution of self-published newspapers to counter Russian propaganda or &#x2014; according to the Ukrainian military-run National Resistance Center &#x2014; passing information about the Russian military to Ukraine. But Olesia emphasizes that Zla Mavka is more than just a resistance group. It has become a source of support for Ukrainians amid the hardship of occupation &#x2014; a community where anonymity is no obstacle to connection. &quot;It&apos;s disgusting, nauseating,&quot; Olesia describes what she feels seeing Russian soldiers in the streets of her hometown every day. &quot;It&apos;s especially difficult when you have to talk to them. You want to say everything you think about them, scratch out their faces, I don&apos;t know what&#x2026; but you have to be discreet and not reveal anything.&quot; The Mavka diaries, vividly illustrated stories written by individual members and published by the group on social media, present poignant accounts of life under Russian war and occupation. &quot;We held on to the last moment but had to leave for Zaporizhzhia,&quot; reads one of the diaries, published in February 2024. &quot;My husband stayed in Mariupol. Forever. My heart remained there, right in the yard of our house that we had been building with love for so long. We buried him in our yard.&#x201D; Omnipresent fear and suppression of Ukrainian identity have become eponymous with the Russian occupation. Ukrainian citizens are denied medical care unless they accept Russian passports. Men are forcibly drafted to fight against their own country. The Ukrainian identity of children is being erased in schools before they&apos;re sent off to &quot;patriotic&quot; military training camps. (L-R) Photos showcasing Zla Mavka&apos;s resistance: posters featuring a Zla Mavka illustration with the text &quot;I don&apos;t want flowers &#x2013; I want my Ukraine,&quot; and a Zla Mavka logo drawn on an arm. (Zla Mavka)&quot;I have never felt so much fear in my life as I do now. Being under occupation, I constantly feel in danger; I fear for my life. I am afraid that they will come for me and imprison me for supporting Ukraine. I am afraid that they will torture me. I am afraid that I will never see my son,&quot; reads another passage from a Mavka from Starobilsk, a city in Luhansk Oblast occupied since March 2022. Even for those who do not plant bombs under railway tracks or report the movement of Russian troops to Ukrainian authorities, the realities of the occupation are unavoidable and deeply personal. Displaying Ukrainian symbols is punished, and people are afraid to speak the Ukrainian language. It is in the acts of resistance, great or small, that Ukrainians find strength while living under occupation. &quot;You feel that you are doing something for which you will not be ashamed to look your children in the eyes, that you are helping, that you did not break,&quot; Olesia explains. But every time, it is as scary as the first time, she admits, using a common Ukrainian saying that translates to: &quot;The eyes are scared, but the hands are doing.&quot; At the time when Zla Mavka was founded, the hope felt across Ukraine was palpable. Not only were Russian forces humiliated in Kyiv Oblast, but Ukrainian counteroffensives in the fall of 2022 liberated dozens of towns and villages in Kherson and Kharkiv oblasts, including the city of Kherson. But then a new counteroffensive, the long-awaited one that was meant to cut into Russian lines in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in the summer of 2023, didn&#x2019;t succeed. Since then, the front line has been moving in Russia&#x2019;s favor, with Ukraine suffering a series of painful losses in the eastern Donetsk Oblast. Both Kyiv and its Western partners now acknowledge that a liberation of Ukrainian land by force of arms is unlikely in the near future. As U.S. officials propose ceasefire deals that would leave millions of Ukrainians under Russian occupation, hopelessness is creeping in. &quot;It&apos;s scary. People are thinking about options of what to do if it happens,&quot; Olesia says of a ceasefire that would leave the occupied lands under Russian control. &quot;Many people despair, many are trying to decide how to live (under the occupation).&quot; News from the front line brings no comfort as well, as Russia continues to raze and capture new villages, one by one. &quot;Sometimes it seems that behind all those headlines about territories and kilometers, some forget that these are all people, lives, homes, destinies,&quot; Olesia says. An artwork depicting stories of people in occupied territories, submitted to Zla Mavka. (Zla Mavka)As it&#x2019;s capturing more Ukrainian land, Russia is also tightening its grasp on the occupied territories, according to Olesia. The occupation administration has ramped up surveillance, with increasingly common security checks and more cameras in the streets. Even the initial advantage that Mavka held &#x2014; that Russian soldiers would not suspect women to be resistance members &#x2014; has lost its edge as the occupiers grow more careful, Olesia says. It is hard enough to fight against overwhelming odds in constant fear. It is harder still when hope is in short supply. In spite of this, the Mavkas fight on. Talking about what keeps her motivations, Olesia says laconically, &quot;Somebody has to do it. It just happens to be us.&quot; Although layered with melancholy, her messages reveal a sense of purpose and perseverance. &quot;The power is in the people. Each of us has the power to do something to help this world, from a leaflet to big decisions in the world&apos;s seats of power,&quot; she says in a message from occupied Ukraine to the free world. &quot;We are here, and despite everything, we continue to resist because evil must not win. Please fight with us and for us.&quot; Hi, this is Martin Fornusek. With our team, we strive to bring you true stories of the Ukrainian resistance, of the bravery of Ukrainian men and women like Olesia defying Russian occupation for so many years. We wouldn&apos;t be able to do so without the support of readers like you. To help us continue in this work, please consider becoming a member of the Kyiv Independent&apos;s community. Thank you very much.	https://kyivindependent.com/for-ukraines-female-partisans-in-occupation-hope-lies-in-resistance/	2025-01-30T10:52:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/flag_new.svg
How two female entrepreneurs from Ukraine are reshaping the fashion industry	Editor&#x2019;s note: This article is part of a series of profiles highlighting successful Ukrainian startups and businesses. The series is funded by the regional investment fund Ukraine-Moldova American Enterprise Fund (UMAEF) and created in partnership with Spend With Ukraine, a non-profit organization that launched a platform to showcase businesses with Ukrainian roots and provide one more meaningful way to support Ukraine &#x2013; by choosing to spend with Ukraine. The series&#x2019; sponsors are not involved in the editorial process of the writing of these profiles. For Daria Shapovalova, co-founder of the digital fashion platform DressX, fashion isn&#x2019;t just about fabric and buttons anymore &#x2014; &#xA0;it&#x2019;s about pixels and animations. Founded in Los Angeles in 2020 by Ukrainian entrepreneurs Shapovalova and Natalia Modanova, DressX is part of a larger transformation of how the world experiences fashion, taking the industry into the realm of avatars and the Metaverse. The platform uses artificial intelligence and augmented reality to create virtual clothing, allowing its users to &#x201C;try them on&#x201D; virtually and purchase the items for their virtual wardrobe. The digital fashion industry is among the fastest-growing sectors, projected to hit $2.4 billion in value in 2024, with exponential growth driven by the increasing influence of gaming, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), and the Metaverse in daily life. DressX&#x2019;s creators say their company distinguishes itself from the major players like the Fabricant and RTFKT, which was recently acquired by Nike, by focusing primarily on avatar fashion stores, and catering both to individual users and businesses. Avatar fashion allows its creators to design and customize virtual clothing and accessories that can be worn by their digital avatars on social media and gaming platforms like Snapchat, Meta, Roblox, and Zepeto. An example of DressX&apos;s &quot;metacloset&quot; virtual wardrobe concept, popular among digital natives, features augmented reality looks, on-chain fashion collectibles, and avatar fashion for virtual worlds. (DressX)With most of its users based in the U.S., DressX appeals to Gen Z and Millennials who are naturally drawn to virtual spaces. &quot;The first time (the young generation) see Adidas, it&#x2019;s on Roblox. The first time they see Louis Vuitton, it&#x2019;s on Fortnite,&#x201D; says Shapovalova in an interview with the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;So brands should adjust, and we&#x2019;re here to help &#x2014; we&#x2019;re here to build the biggest brands in online environments.&#x201D; As of 2024, DressX has distributed over 60 million digital assets, or digital garments, across various platforms. DressX&#x2019;s collaboration with Meta in 2022 in marked a significant milestone, expanding its reach by bringing innovative 3D designs to platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger, all of which are owned by Meta. DressX has also collaborated with well-established brands, bringing Lacoste&#x2019;s iconic styles to platforms like Roblox and Zepeto, and Diesel&#x2019;s trendy designs to the Meta avatar store. In another collaboration, Hugo Boss implemented DressX Mirror, an interactive display that allows users to try on AR outfits during its events. Lacoste Bitmoji by DressX. (DressX)The journey of DressX founders, Shapovalova and Modonova, began in Ukraine. The two were part of organizing the Mercedes-Benz Kyiv Fashion Days and Shapovalova hosted a fashion TV show. Their transition into tech was a deliberate move that started in 2017 when Shapovalova relocated to San Francisco to pursue a business degree, driven by the idea that fashion is more than just clothing. &#x201C;I understood that the fashion industry is actually more than just a beautiful picture, but also a business,&#x201D; Shapovalova recalls. &#x201C;That was exactly the nature of the show (I hosted) &#x2014; to show that this industry is beautiful, but there is a business aspect.&#x201D; As women and immigrants in a male-dominated tech world, Shapovalova and Modonova are in the minority. Shapovalova recalls attending business conferences where women made up only a small fraction of the room. &#x201C;When you go to a venture event in San Francisco, only about 1% of the audience is female,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;It makes you feel a little different, but it&#x2019;s not like people don&#x2019;t notice you&#x2019;re there.&#x201D; Modonova adds: &quot;We are benchmarking ourselves against everyone else. At the end of the day, it&#x2019;s about the business that you built &#x2014; you are judged by what you&#x2019;ve done, not by whether you&#x2019;re a man or woman.&apos;&quot; Although digital fashion offers a sustainable alternative to traditional clothing, Shapovalova and Modonova emphasize that their mission is not to compete with fast fashion but to create something entirely new. DressX&#x2019;s &quot;metacloset&quot; includes augmented reality styles and avatar fashion for virtual worlds. (DressX)&#x201C;We&#x2019;re not here to fight the mass market,&#x201D; Modonova explains. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re here to create new categories and opportunities for people to experience fashion in ways they couldn&#x2019;t before.&#x201D; But the environmental impact is undeniable. &quot;We have a couple of patents and a methodology for calculating how many resources are spent on producing one virtual item versus a physical one,&quot; the co-founders say. As far as new opportunities to experience fashion go, DressX has developed various tools and solutions since its inception. Through its DressX App, users can try on virtual outfits using augmented reality, while the AI-driven DressXCode fashion game allows them to create themed outfits for virtual environments. The DressX Mirror, an AR-powered interactive screen, brings a futuristic twist to retail stores, enabling patrons to virtually try on clothes. Additionally, DressX offers exclusive NFTs, allowing users to own unique digital designs for platforms like Roblox and Zepeto. Their latest venture, an AI-driven fashion game, merges entertainment with style. DressX&#x2019;s creators say they want to continue scaling their company and leading the fashion revolution. &apos;We will definitely contribute to change in the industry,&apos; Shapovalova says. &apos;Will we be the only company to change it? No, we&#x2019;re part of a much bigger shift in the industry.&apos;&quot; DressX is reshaping fashion in the digital age, combining sustainability with innovation to show that style can thrive without harming the planet.

50% of Poles oppose Ukraine's EU, NATO membership until Volyn issue resolved, poll shows	Half of Poles believe Ukraine should not join NATO or the European Union until the issue of exhuming Volyn massacre victims is resolved, according to a new poll published on Jan. 30. The poll conducted by the Institute for Social Research and Market (IBRiS) found that 27.7% of respondents &quot;strongly&quot; oppose Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO and the EU without addressing this issue, while 22.5% &quot;rather&quot; oppose. The Volyn massacre occurred during World War II. Tens of thousands of Poles were murdered by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (known by its Ukrainian acronym UPA) in the Nazi-occupied region of Volhynia, which was then a part of Poland and is nowadays a region in western Ukraine. Thousands of Ukrainians were killed by Polish military formations in retaliation. Polish opposition supporters, particularly viewers of the Polish right-wing Republic TV, which backs the Law and Justice (PiS) party, are the primary group insisting on the condition of exhuming Volyn massacre victims, polish media outlet Rzeczpospolita noted. The poll also shows that 20.4% &quot;rather&quot; support Ukraine&apos;s accession and 14.4% &quot;strongly&quot; support it. The remaining 15% were undecided. The survey was conducted on Jan. 24-25 using computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) with 1,071 respondents. Since the beginning of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Poland has been one of Ukraine&#x2019;s most prominent allies and supporters. But disagreements in the approach to the historic events have thrown a shadow on relations between the states. Ukraine and Poland reached a breakthrough regarding the issue in January. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced on Jan. 10. that the first exhumations of Volyn massacre victims were approved by both sides earlier in the month. The issue of Volyn exhumations has become a political fault line ahead of Poland&apos;s presidential election, scheduled for May. Karol Nawrocki, the PiS-backed presidential candidate, said on Jan. 8 that Ukraine should not join the EU or NATO unless it &quot;answers&quot; for the Polish victims of the massacre. Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, the ruling coalition&apos;s presidential candidate, supports Ukraine&apos;s EU and NATO membership.	https://kyivindependent.com/50-of-poles-oppose-ukraines-eu-nato-membership-until-volyn-issue-resolved-survey-finds/	2025-01-30T09:56:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1239548149.jpg
Ukraine identifies Russian commanders behind deadly hypermarket strike on Kharkiv	Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) has identified four Russian generals and one colonel responsible for the deadly attack on a hypermarket in Kharkiv, the agency reported on Jan. 30. The attack on the Epicenter hypermarket was carried out with guided aerial bombs on May 25. It killed 19 people, including two children, and injured 46 others. A third bomb, which did not detonate, was later found at the site. According to the investigation, Russian forces used Su-34 bombers to launch three UMPB D-30SN guided bombs at the hypermarket. The SBU identified Colonel-General Alexander Lapin, commander of Russia&apos;s North military group, as the official who ordered the strike. His chief of staff, Lieutenant General Valery Solodchuk, planned out the attack, according to the SBU. Three more officers were allegedly involved in the planning and execution: The SBU charged all five officers in absentia with violating the laws and customs of war, resulting in loss of life, committed by prior conspiracy. Kharkiv, Ukraine&apos;s second-largest city located just over 20 kilometers from the Russian border, remains particularly vulnerable to Russia&apos;s guided bombs. Due to the city&apos;s proximity to Russia, Russian aircraft can strike at Kharkiv from within their own airspace.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-identifies-russian-commanders-behind-deadly-hypermarket-strike-on-kharkiv/	2025-01-30T09:12:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2154621713.jpg
Has Chasiv Yar fallen? No, say experts, OSINT analysts, military officials	Reports that the embattled Ukrainian city of Chasiv Yar has fallen to Russian forces have been dismissed by experts and officials speaking to the Kyiv Independent, and the latest OSINT data suggests fighting is still ongoing. The front-line city has become one of the hottest spots in Donetsk Oblast in recent months as Russian troops continue advancing in eastern Ukraine. The battle for control of Chasiv Yar has been raging for months, with Ukraine&apos;s forces limiting Russian advances to a slow and incremental slog with both sides engaged in brutal street-to-street fighting. On Jan. 29, the Moscow Times published a report declaring the city had fallen to Moscow&apos;s forces, citing five Ukrainian and European military and government sources. Neither Ukraine nor Russia has officially commented directly on the report, but comments from Ukrainian military officials, OSINT analysts, and even Russian military bloggers all suggest fighting is still ongoing in Chasiv Yar. Speaking on national TV on Jan. 29, Ruslan Muzychuk, spokesperson of the National Guard of Ukraine, made no mention of the fall of the city but acknowledged Russian attacks had &quot;significantly intensified&quot; and incorporated some of Moscow&apos;s best-trained troops. &quot;The enemy has recently increased the number of personnel involved in infantry assaults (in this direction),&quot; he said, adding: &quot;These are not only motorized rifle units, but also airborne regiments, and special forces battalions.&quot; Russian advnaces in Chasiv Yar as of Jan. 29 (Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)Muzychuk said Russian forces were employing a range of weapons to attack Ukrainian positions including aviation, artillery and fiber optic drones. He added that urban warfare of the type being waged in the destroyed streets of Chasiv Yar was the &quot;most difficult type of battle for infantry&quot; for both defenders and attackers. &quot;That is why quite often the enemy tries to bypass the city by the flanks, this in particular, applies to Chasiv Yar,&quot; he added. But while reports of Chasiv Yar&apos;s fall may be premature, the direction of the battle for the city is going in Russia&apos;s favor, albeit slowly. The battle for Chasiv Yar has now been waged for months, beginning in April 2024 as part of Russia&apos;s grinding, slow, and costly advances in Donetsk Oblast. After the fall of Bakhmut in May 2023 and the fall of Avdiivka in February 2024, Russian forces overran one village after another and took up positions close to Chasiv Yar. Located on hills, Chasiv Yar boasts the highest point in the area, an important target for any army wanting to gain an advantage. It is divided in the east by the Siverskyi Donets-Donbas canal, creating a barrier between the Kanal micro-district and the rest of the city. Throughout most of spring, Kyiv&apos;s forces managed to keep Russian troops out of the city. But since then, Moscow&apos;s forces have advanced incrementally into the city, reaching the canal and forcing Ukrainian forces to partially retreat in July.

(Wolfgang Schwan/Anadolu via Getty Images)The canal became the zero line and the front remained largely static in this area until Russian forces crossed it in mid-October. Since then, Russian forces have continued to make small advances into Chasiv Yar, but according to experts and analysts, are still some way from taking the entire city. Before Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Chasiv Yar was home to around 12,000 people. On Jan. 29, Ukraine&apos;s Interior Ministry posted an aerial view of the city on social media. &quot;After the arrival of the Russians, only a wasteland remains,&quot; the statement read. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t say that Chasiv Yar has fallen yet,&quot; Emil Kastehelmi, an OSINT analyst with the Finland-based Black Bird Group and military history expert, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It&apos;s an unfavorable trend for the Ukrainians, but the Russian pace of advance has been so slow that it will take weeks or months before the battle of Chasiv Yar is over,&quot; he added. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) on Jan. 29 cited several OSINT analysts and Russian military bloggers and assessed that although Russian forces &#x2014; including Chechen &#x201C;Akhmat&#x201D; Spetsnaz forces &#x2014; had made advances in Chasiv Yar and the surrounding area, there are no indication that the city had fallen. &quot;The Russians have actually made some progress inside the city,&quot; Kastehelmi said, adding Russian forces had taken &quot;most of the northern parts of the city.&quot; A view of destruction from a Russian attack in Chasiv Yar, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on Oct. 7, 2024. (Maciek Musialek/Anadolu via Getty Images)&quot;The Ukrainians are still defending the southern and central parts, and there may also be some fighting going on near the northern parts of the city,&quot; he added. If Russia were able to take the city, it would have a significant impact on the war in Donetsk Oblast and is crucial for Russia&apos;s larger offensive ambitions in the east. Holding the city allows the military to retain fire control over key supply routes, severely hampering the opposing army&#x2019;s operations in the area. Ultimately, the fall of Chasiv Yar would mean the last Ukrainian strongholds in Donetsk Oblast &#x2014; the cities of Kostiantynivka, Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk, and Sloviansk &#x2014; would be under massive threat from Russian forces.

Sweden unveils its largest military aid package for Ukraine worth $1.2 billion	Sweden will provide Ukraine with a military aid package worth over $1.2 billion, Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson announced on Jan. 30. It is Sweden&apos;s largest tranche of military assistance since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, according to Johnson. The package includes 16 CB90 combat boats with weapons stations, a million rounds of 12.7 mm ammunition, 146 trucks, 1,500 TOW anti-tank missiles, as well as 200 AT4 anti-tank launchers. About $90 million will be allocated for the production of long-range missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles, Johnson said. Donations from the Swedish Armed Forces&apos; stockpiles will account for roughly 25% of the package, while around 45% will be used for investment in defense production. &quot;This can be directed towards prioritized needs, such as artillery, long-range strike abilities and drones. A short delivery time is important,&quot; the minister said. Under the new package, $178 million will be allocated for the so-called Danish model of funding for Ukraine&apos;s defense production. Other funds will also be allocated for the training of Ukrainian soldiers in 2025, as well as the repair and maintenance of the equipment already donated by Sweden. At the end of 2024, Jonson said in an interview with the Kyiv Independent that Stockholm does not exclude the possibility of expanding its physical presence in Ukraine to strengthen the country&apos;s defenses.	https://kyivindependent.com/sweden-unveils-its-largest-military-aid-package-for-ukraine-worth-1-2-billion/	2025-01-30T08:50:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/Pa-l-Jonson-2.jpg
What's behind Zelensky's recent round of sanctions on top pro-Russian politicians, propagandists, energy mogul?	In late January, President Volodymyr Zelensky slapped sanctions on 18 people, both Russians and Ukrainians. The list included 10 Ukrainian nationals, four Russians, and four people with both Ukrainian and Russian citizenship. Among them were Ukrainian politicians spreading Russian narratives for years, local media personalities said to be parroting Russian propaganda, suspected Russian collaborators, a former head of the now-banned Communist Party of Ukraine, and a businessman from the list of the richest Ukrainians. The list included a few notorious personalities. The highest-profile politician among them was Yuriy Boyko, a lawmaker and former head of the now-banned political party, Opposition Platform &#x2014; For Life, that for years was the country&apos;s main pro-Russian party. &quot;We are blocking propagandists working for Russia, individuals who have sided with the enemy, and those aiding Russia in continuing the war,&quot; Zelensky said on Jan. 19. However, the sanctions against Boyko were rather symbolical: He was stripped of his Ukrainian state awards, which the pro-Russian politician had gathered quite a few. There were no sanctions that limited his economic or political activities. For others on the list, however, sanctions included freezing of assets, suspension of economic activity and extraction of resources, as well as a ban on flights and shipment of goods. The restrictions are valid for 10 years. Among those hit by the full power of restrictive measures was one of Ukraine&apos;s richest people, Ukraine-born businessman Kostiantyn Hryhoryshyn, who did not renounce his Russian citizenship. He said that he has applied to renounce his Russian citizenship, but it was not granted because he is also under Russian sanctions and was convicted in absentia by a Moscow court for tax evasion. In 2021, Hryhoryshyn was listed by Forbes among 100 richest Ukrainians with a fortune estimated at $275 million. Now he owns his Ukrainian assets through Cyprus offshore companies or through his business partners, NV reported. He remains a co-owner of Ukrainian regional energy companies. Volodymyr Fesenko, a Ukrainian political analyst, said this sanctions package was likely a response to the public uproar following the resurface of a number of Ukrainian pro-Russian politicians and propagandists on YouTube and social media platforms. &quot;I think, Zelensky himself, and the President&#x2019;s Office, (had) a feeling that some pro-Russian figures had raised their heads, that they felt that the war was supposedly over, that they could start preparing for an election campaign, that they could resume pro-Russian rhetoric,&quot; Fesenko said. &quot;This is a signal to everyone else.&quot; The sanctions coincided with Ukrainian law enforcement conducting a wide range of searches and arrests of suspected Russian collaborators, pro-Russian politicians, propagandists, and those publicly sharing pro-Russian views. &#xA0; In just three days, a total of 222 people were declared to be suspects by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), and 85 of whom were detained, the SBU said on Jan. 22. Among them was Vadym Novynskyi, an ex-lawmaker from the now-banned pro-Russian Opposition Bloc and key sponsor of the Russia-affiliated Ukrainian Orthodox Church. He was charged with high treason on Jan. 18. After the start of the full-scale invasion, Novynskyi resigned from Ukraine&apos;s parliament and fled abroad. He was sanctioned by Ukraine in December 2022. For years, Novynskyi was listed among the richest Ukrainians, with Forbes estimating his wealth at $1.4 billion in the spring of 2023. Another high-profile figure that suffered from the crackdown was Max Nazarov, a former host of pro-Russian TV channels banned in Ukraine for spreading pro-Kremlin disinformation and propaganda. Nazarov, whose real name is Nazar Diorditsa, is suspected of justifying Russia&apos;s armed aggression against Ukraine. He was arrested on Jan. 21, with an option of a Hr 12 million ($286,000) bail to be placed for his release. Nazarov has gained notoriety as a presenter at Ukrainian TV channels owned by pro-Russian politicians like Viktor Medvedchuk, Taras Kozak, and Yevheniy Murayev. All the pro-Russian channels, including NewsOne, Nash TV, ZIK and Channel 112, were banned shortly before the start of the full-scale war. Yeheniy Murayev, an ex-lawmaker of the Ukrainian parliament, Kyiv, Ukraine on June 22, 2019. (Alexey Ivanov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Nazarov switched to hosting interviews on his own YouTube channel. During Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, he has invited guests who have been vocal in blaming the U.S. for Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Before Russia&#x2019;s all-out war, Nazarov denied Russian involvement in the war against Ukraine, Detector Media reported. He called his arrest &quot;unfair&quot; and promised to appeal the court decision. Nazarov&apos;s former boss Yevheniy Murayev has also made a splash in the news recently. In January, Murayev, a former pro-Russian lawmaker, published a two-hour-long interview on YouTube, marking his first public appearance after almost three years of the all-out war. Shortly before the start of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the U.K. Foreign Office publicly warned that the Kremlin intends to install Murayev as the head of the Russian puppet regime in Kyiv. Murayev fled Ukraine in May 2022. In 2023, he was charged with treason. In the new interview that allegedly took place in Beijing, Murayev parroted Russian narratives, blaming Zelensky for Russia&apos;s all-out invasion. The ex-lawmaker also opposed the idea of Ukraine&apos;s EU and NATO accession, and criticized Western sanctions imposed on Moscow. Two days later, Murayev was on Zelensky&apos;s sanctions list. Another high-profile person on the sanctions list was Svitlana Kriukova, a Ukrainian journalist and former deputy chief editor of Strana.ua &#x2013; a controversial media outlet that has been banned in Ukraine since 2021. Its editor-in-chief Ihor Huzhva has fled Ukraine in 2018 after being investigated for extortion. He was sanctioned in Ukraine in 2021 along with his publication. Being the publication&apos;s second-in-command, Kriukova has gained a controversial reputation among Ukrainian media observers, who often alleged that she was shaping public opinion to benefit Russia. Kriukova has also been critical of Ukraine&apos;s leadership. After she was put under sanctions by Zelensky, Kriukova publicly denied that she ever shared pro-Russian narratives, and said she would appeal the sanctions in court. Yaroslav Zubchenko, a media expert at Detector Media, a Ukrainian media watchdog, says that people like Nazarov, Murayev, and Kriukova&apos;s public rhetoric &quot;benefits Russia.&quot; &quot;They have clearly, consciously or not &#x2013; in my opinion, consciously &#x2013; helped Russia in its invasion of Ukraine,&quot; Yaroslav Zubchenko, media expert at Detector Media, told the Kyiv Independent. Another high-profile name on the sanctions list is lawmaker Nestor Shufrych, who was arrested in 2023 on charges of subversive activities against Ukraine and paying Russia&apos;s National Guard in occupied Crimea to protect his real estate on the peninsula. Zelensky has started using sanctions as a way to target Ukrainian citizens and entities even before the start of the all-out war with Russia. In 2021, Ukraine&#x2019;s National Security and Defense Council slapped sanctions on Ukrainian citizens for the first time. Taras Kozak and Viktor Medvedchuk, both charged with high treason and financing terrorism, were the first ones on the list. Sanctions were also imposed on pro-Russian TV channels linked to the two MPs, which were immediately shut down &#x2014; NewsOne, ZIK and Channel 112. Viktor Medvedchuk at the session of the Verkhovna Rada in Kyiv, Ukraine on Jan. 14, 2020. (Sergii Kharchenko/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Most Ukrainians supported these moves at the time. Zelensky&#x2019;s electoral rating inched up. The recent round of sanctions followed the rise of pro-Russian activity in the country amid war. In mid-December, Boyko published a video on TikTok, repeating long-standing Kremlin propaganda. Almost three years into Russia&#x2019;s all-out war, Boyko stayed in Kyiv, untouched by authorities. After the video, he was questioned by the Security Service (SBU), without any further charges. In 2020, Boyko was ranked as the 79th richest Ukrainian, according to the NV media outlet. His asset declaration showed that Boyko&apos;s and his wife&apos;s total income for 2023 exceeded Hr 54 million ($1.3 million). Ukrainian investigative media outlet Bihus.Info reported in 2023 that the Boyko family owns dozens of hectares of land, thousands of square meters of real estate, and has a number of hidden sources of income, including an energy company registered under his son&#x2019;s name. If four years ago, some observers labeled sanctions against pro-Russian forces in Ukraine as an attack on freedom of speech, there&#x2019;s little talk of injustice now. &quot;In times of war, such sanctions are adopted as a way of protecting your (Ukraine&#x2019;s) interests,&quot; said Fesenko. Shortly after the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the European Union imposed sanctions on Kremlin-controlled Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik media. A Russia state-controlled RT broadcast van is parked near St. Basil&apos;s Cathedral and the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, on March 16, 2018. (Mladen Antonov/AFP via Getty Images)Ahead of the 2024 presidential election, Washington also sanctioned RT. Antony Blinken, former U.S. secretary of state, accused it of being a &quot;de facto arm of Russia&apos;s intelligence apparatus.&quot; &quot;They (European countries) actually did the same thing we did, but later. Because we are closer (to Russia), it concerns us first and foremost. We understand Russia better, historically,&quot; Zubchenko told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We know what we&apos;re really doing, because it&apos;s not about freedom of speech. We were the first to notice the threat, we were the first to block it.&quot; However, the main difference is the reach of Ukrainian sanctions that now target Ukrainian citizens without a criminal record. A step, the legality of which remains uncertain. Ukrainian law prohibits public calls for the overthrow of the constitutional order, as well as incitement to national or religious hatred. According to the Law on Sanctions, Ukraine can impose sanctions against foreigners and foreign entities, as well as Ukrainians who engage in terrorist activities. &quot;In the practice of our (Ukrainian) law enforcement, terrorist activity is a very broad concept,&quot; said Tetiana Shevchuk, a lawyer of the Kyiv-based NGO Anti Corruption Action Center (ANTAC). Several Ukrainians on the sanctions list &#x2014; including &#xA0;Boyko, Kriukova and Hryhoryshyn &#x2014; weren&apos;t officially charged with any wrongdoing. The Kyiv Independent sent a request for comments to the SBU but has not received a response at the time of publication. &quot;Ukrainian law enforcement agencies can freely work against Ukrainian citizens, especially when it comes to freezing assets. Sanctions are an extra fast mechanism, and in the interests of national security, it may be justified to apply them against Ukrainian citizens,&quot; Shevchuk said.	https://kyivindependent.com/three-years-into-all-out-war-zelensky-cracks-down-on-countrys-top-pro-russian-politicians-propagandists/	2025-01-30T08:12:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190032907-1.jpg
Ukraine’s parcel delivery giant Nova Poshta invests $43 million to expand network in 2024	Ukraine&apos;s largest private delivery company Nova Poshta invested Hr 1.8 billion ($43 million) to expand its Ukrainian network in 2024, a 35% increase from 2023, the company on social media. The company opened 1,747 new branches across Ukraine and installed 8,410 self-service delivery package lockers in 2024, bringing the total number of its service points across the country to 37,210. Nova Poshta, Ukraine&#x2019;s domestic version of FedEx or DHL, is by far the country&#x2019;s most popular parcel delivery service, operating in more than 10,000 cities and towns across Ukraine. It is widely used by soldiers and volunteers ordering and sending goods and cargo to the front lines. As Ukrainians fled abroad at the outset of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion the company followed them, expanding rapidly across Europe since late 2022. It has since opened branches in 16 European countries. The company said it expanded its network near the front lines, despite the risks. It opened 1,214 service points primarily in the eastern Kharkiv, Dnipro, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. As part of last year&#x2019;s investments, Nova Poshta allocated Hr 32 million ($764,838) to open the company&#x2019;s first barrier-free branch in Kyiv. Russia&#x2019;s war, which has caused life-altering injuries to both soldiers and civilians, has pushed the government and businesses to consider investments in accessibility. The 709-square-meter barrier-free branch has an accessible design including a digital assistant, adapted furniture, and automated doors with sound beacons. Nova Poshta also delivered a record 480 million packages in 2024, including 19 million international parcels &#x2014; an 86% increase from the year before, the company said. Ukrainians most often ordered goods from China, the U.S., Poland, the U.K., and other countries, according to company data. Nova Poshta, known abroad as Nova Post, now operates in France, the U.K., Spain, Poland, Italy, Austria, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Romania, Germany, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Slovakia, Hungary, and Moldova. In 2025, Nova Poshta plans to invest Hr 1.2 billion ($28 million) in opening 11,000 more service points and improving older ones.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-parcel-delivery-giant-nova-poshta-invests-43-million-to-expand-network-in-2024/	2025-01-30T07:46:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/-------------------.jpg
Ukraine's Foreign Ministry calls Fico 'Kremlin's mouthpiece,' summons Slovak ambassador over recent remarks	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry summoned Slovak Ambassador Pavel Vizdal on Jan. 30 to express its rejection of Bratislava&apos;s claims that Kyiv is interfering in Slovakia&apos;s internal affairs. This comes amid tensions between Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Fico, who maintains friendly ties with Russia, has escalated threats against Kyiv following the termination of Russian gas transit via Ukrainian territory on Jan. 1. In his remarks on Jan. 28, Fico called Zelensky &quot;the enemy&quot; of Slovakia. Ukraine expressed &quot;deep disappointment&quot; over Fico&apos;s statements, accusing him of acting as &quot;the Kremlin&apos;s mouthpiece&quot; while ignoring Slovakia&apos;s EU membership. The Foreign Ministry warned that this undermines relations between the two countries and damages EU unity. Earlier on Jan. 29, the Slovak Foreign Ministry summoned Ukrainian Ambassador Myroslav Kastran, delivering a &quot;strong protest&quot; against what it called Ukrainian interference in Slovakia&apos;s internal affairs. Just days before, Zelensky voiced support for protests against Fico&apos;s government, writing on X, &quot;Bratislava is not Moscow, Slovakia is Europe.&quot; The protests, which kicked off on Jan. 24 under the slogan &quot;Slovakia is Europe,&quot; saw around 100,000 people across 30 cities demanding an end to Fico&apos;s leadership. Fico has earlier threatened to limit aid to Ukrainians and cut electricity supplies amid an energy crisis caused by Russian attacks on Ukraine&apos;s power grid. The prime minister&apos;s friendly stance toward the Kremlin, including a controversial meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in December, has drawn condemnation from European leaders.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-foreign-ministry-calls-fico-kremlins-mouthpiece-summons-slovak-ambassador-over-recent-remarks/	2025-01-30T07:21:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/679b660ddf43f339020311.jpg
Russian oligarch held stake in Musk's SpaceX through trust despite sanctions, Bloomberg reports	Russian billionaire and politician Suleyman Kerimov held at least a 1% stake in SpaceX through a trust, even after the U.S. sanctioned him in 2018 for aiding President Vladimir Putin&apos;s policies, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 30, citing undisclosed sources. Kerimov, whose estimated fortune is $9.84 billion, ranks 290th on Bloomberg&apos;s Billionaires Index and 17th among Russian billionaires. The Dagestani senator was subject to additional EU sanctions for allegedly supporting Russian actions that violated Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty. Kerimov&apos;s investment in SpaceX reportedly began in 2017 through Heritage Trust, a financial structure managed by Citigroup. SpaceX was valued at $21 billion at the time, meaning his 1% stake could have been worth around $210 million. Elon Musk, the richest person in the world and a close associate of U.S. President Donald Trump, is the founder and CEO of SpaceX. Despite the sanctions imposed on Kerimov by the first Trump administration, Citigroup continued managing Heritage Trust, reportedly seeking the Treasury Department&apos;s guidance and concluding there was no requirement to block the trust. Following the outbreak of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. seized Kerimov&apos;s $300 million superyacht Amadea in April 2022 and sanctioned his family and associates later that year. The Treasury, at the time run by the Biden administration, froze the trust in June 2022 after investigators found it was structured to obscure Kerimov as its primary beneficiary. By December 2024, SpaceX&apos;s valuation had surged to $350 billion, meaning the lost stake would be worth approximately $3.5 billion today. In November 2024, reports emerged that the U.S. Justice Department, the Federal Investigation Bureau (FBI), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) were investigating Citigroup&apos;s handling of Heritage Trust. Musk, who is estimated to be worth $421 billion, traveled to Russia in 2017 to explore potential partnerships with the space agency Roscosmos but did not reach a deal. While initially supportive of Ukraine after the start of the full-scale war, Musk has made progressively controversial remarks about Ukraine and the conflict.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-oligarchs-hidden-stake-in-musks-spacex-revealed-despite-sanctions-bloomberg-reported/	2025-01-30T05:53:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1232307204-1.jpg
Lithuania open to sending peacekeepers to Ukraine, chief commander says	Lithuania will likely consider deploying military personnel to Ukraine for a potential peacekeeping mission, Lithuanian Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Raimundas Vaiksnoras said on Jan. 30, according to the LRT broadcaster. His remarks come amid ongoing discussions among Western countries about the possible deployment of peacekeeping forces if a ceasefire is negotiated. Earlier reports from The Wall Street Journal indicated that U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s team is weighing a plan to delay Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for continued Western arms supplies and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said on Jan. 18 that Germany may consider contributing forces to such a mission, while U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed on Jan. 16 that he had discussed the matter with President Volodymyr Zelensky. Moscow has strongly opposed the idea. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova warned on Jan. 23 that deploying a NATO peacekeeping contingent to Ukraine could lead to &quot;uncontrolled escalation.&quot; Zelensky has said that Trump could potentially broker an end to the war but stressed that any agreement must involve Kyiv. While Trump has vowed to resolve the conflict quickly, his aides have suggested that any potential settlement could take months. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Jan. 24 that Moscow is open to talks with Trump on ending the war in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-consider-sending-troops-to-ukraine-for-peacekeeping-mission-chief-commander-says/	2025-01-30T05:08:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/lithuania.jpg
Defense Ministry must resolve procurement agencies issues by February, Deputy PM says	The Defense Ministry must resolve all issues regarding the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) and the State Rear Operator (DOT) by the end of February, said Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna, Suspilne reported on Jan. 30. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov on Jan. 24 refused to extend the contract with the DPA director Maryna Bezrukova for another year over supposedly poor performance, defying the DPA Supervisory Board&apos;s decision. According to Bezrukova, Umerov&apos;s move caused a &quot;legal conflict&quot; inside the organization, reportedly blocking its procurement functions. Umerov also launched an internal investigation into Bezrukova&apos;s activity at the DPA, which led to her suspension. At the same time, the minister appointed Arsen Zhumadilov, who also runs the DOT, as interim director general of the DPA. One of NATO and European partners&apos; requirements for Ukraine was the establishment of two agencies that would be directly responsible for procurement for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, not through the Defense Ministry or contractors. Both organizations are responsible for procurement to meet the needs of the Ukrainian army. The DPA specializes in purchasing weapons and equipment, while the DOT buys food, fuel, and clothing. &quot;NATO in no way takes sides, does not support certain parties or certain individuals, whether it is the acting head of the agency (Zhumadilov), the former head of the agency, or the suspended head (Bezrukova). It does not matter; there are key principles,&quot; Stefanishyna said during her working visit to Brussels. Stefanishyna added that such &quot;aggressive public communication&quot; is not beneficial inside or outside Ukraine. &quot;As a team responsible for Euro-Atlantic integration, of course, we communicate with the team from the Defense Ministry that all changes that take place should be in line with NATO recommendations in the field of defense procurement,&quot; she said. &quot;They were also approved at the Washington summit of the alliance, and I am confident that by the end of February this year, we will resolve the situation because, as a result of the agreements I have at NATO headquarters, a special meeting of the NATO committee will be held at the end of February to consider issues in this area.&quot; According to Ukrainian law, supervisory boards can hire and fire the heads of state enterprises unilaterally. This means that legally, after the board&apos;s vote, Bezrukova should take over the DPA for another year. However, the Defense Ministry, which oversees the DPA, recently amended the agency&apos;s charter, so the ministry can reverse the supervisory board&apos;s decisions. Anti-corruption activists and lawmakers say the amendments and Umerov&apos;s decision are &quot;unlawful.&quot; Following Umerov&apos;s move, the DPA declared that it would continue to operate under Bezrukova&apos;s leadership. The Anti-Corruption Action Center also filed a complaint with the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) to open an investigation against Umerov on suspicion of alleged abuse of power. On Jan. 28, NABU launched a criminal investigation into Umerov.	https://kyivindependent.com/defense-ministry-must-resolve-procurement-issues-deputy-pm-says/	2025-01-30T05:02:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166979167.jpg
Georgescu has 'masters in Moscow' — Kyiv slams Romanian politician over comments on Ukraine's partition	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry on Jan. 30 condemned Romania&apos;s far-right presidential candidate Calin Georgescu&apos;s statement that Ukraine is a &quot;fictional state&quot; whose partition is &quot;inevitable,&quot; labeling his statements as Russian propaganda. &quot;His attempts to position himself as an &apos;independent&apos; politician look absurd &#x2014; the rhetoric he voiced is identical to Russian propaganda, indicating complete dependence on his masters in Moscow,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said. Georgescu&apos;s comments, made in a Jan. 29 interview, were dismissed by Ukraine as revisionist and contrary to international norms, the U.N. Charter, and democratic values. Tykhyi noted that Ukraine remains confident in Romania&apos;s support for a &quot;comprehensive, just, and sustainable peace&quot; in Ukraine. &quot;We remind you that such a development is not part of the plans of the Kremlin and its puppets,&quot; he said. Pro-Russian ultranationalist Georgescu succeeded unexpectedly in Romania&apos;s first round of presidential elections in November 2024. The constitutional court later annulled the results over alleged Russian interference and a hybrid campaign on TikTok that reportedly boosted Georgescu&apos;s candidacy. Georgescu remains the frontrunner for the rescheduled May election, polling 38%. He has openly opposed military aid to Ukraine and the transit of Ukrainian grain through Romania. During his interview, Georgescu also claimed that U.S. President Donald Trump would strike a quick deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he suggested would relieve Romania of its commitments to support Ukraine. Romania&apos;s current leadership has been a staunch ally of Ukraine, providing military aid, including a Patriot air defense system, hosting F-16 pilot training, and facilitating the transit of Ukrainian agricultural products.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-slams-georgescu-over-partition-comment/	2025-01-30T04:56:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2186353250.jpg
Ukrainian court freezes Russian oligarch Deripaska's assets worth nearly $50 million	A Ukrainian court has frozen the assets of Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska worth Hr 2.1 billion (nearly $50 million), the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced on Jan. 29. Deripaska, formerly Russia&apos;s richest man and founder of the Basic Element industrial group and the Rusal aluminum company, was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2018 and the U.K. in 2022 following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Ukraine nationalized some of Deripaska&apos;s business assets already in February 2023. In the latest move, the court immobilized a large consignment of industrial products and raw materials stored in the warehouses of the Mykolaiv Alumina Plant, which the Russian oligarch previously owned. The consignment included almost 500,000 tons of bauxite and alumina produced before the outbreak of full-scale war, the SBU said. The seized materials were the main component to produce aluminum at Deripaska&apos;s Russian Rusal plants, according to the SBU. Deripaska owned these assets through a subsidiary registered in a European Union country. The company was a formal customer of the plant&apos;s products, which were then re-exported to Deripaska&apos;s Russian enterprises. In 2023, Ukrainian law enforcement authorities blocked the shipment of raw materials. Deripaska reportedly manufactures products for the Russian military-industrial complex, including components for Iskander ballistic missiles, drones, and radar systems. In February 2024, the SBU charged Deripaska in absentia with financing actions aimed at overthrowing Ukraine&apos;s constitutional order, seizing state power, and changing Ukraine&apos;s state border. Since 2018, Deripaska has been under U.S. sanctions as a person close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who finances his projects. Following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the billionaire was also stripped of his Cypriot citizenship, which he received in 2017.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-court-arrests-assets-of-russian-oligarch-deripaska-worth-nearly-50-million/	2025-01-30T04:00:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1233264075.jpg
Europe’s inaction on undersea infrastructure is a security time bomb	Following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, concerns over the security of energy and communication infrastructure in the Baltic Sea intensified. Initially, focus was placed on the threat of hybrid attacks from Russia. However, it became evident that Russian military vessels and so-called &quot;research&quot; ships were actively mapping the seabed infrastructure of NATO countries and conducting military exercises near critical NATO infrastructure in international waters. Why target such facilities? Prolonged disruptions to internet connectivity could disrupt businesses, especially financial markets, provoke public anxiety about security, and set the stage for broader military conflict with the Baltic states. In October 2023, the Chinese-registered vessel NewNew Polar Bear dragged its anchor, causing significant damage to two undersea telecommunications cables and a gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea. This marked the first such incident. The European Union and NATO responded more forcefully, launching an investigation into the event. Although the NewNew Polar Bear returned to Tianjin, China, efforts to enhance the protection of seabed infrastructure and monitor security were initiated. This incident, coupled with the explosions of the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines in September 2022, raised concerns about the growing vulnerability of undersea infrastructure. In February 2023, NATO established the Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels. During the NATO summit in Vilnius in July 2023, the alliance&#x2019;s Maritime Command in Northwood, United Kingdom, established the Maritime Center for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure. However, these measures were still in their infancy and could not guarantee the prevention of future incidents. After the NewNew Polar Bear incident, no maritime patrols were introduced to quickly address abnormal activities by civilian vessels linked to Russia or sudden changes in vessel routes. Intelligence-sharing was enhanced, and in February 2024, the European Commission issued its first Recommendation on Secure and Resilient Submarine Cable Infrastructures. This recommendation, which emphasized faster information exchange and stress tests of undersea infrastructure, sought to consolidate fragmented actions and address the needs of individual countries. The Eagle S oil tanker is seen anchored near the Port of Kilpilahti in Porvoo, Finland, on Jan. 13, 2025. (Vesa Moilanen / Lehtikuva / AFP via Getty Images)By late 2024, another incident occurred when the Chinese cargo ship Yi Peng 3 dragged its anchor, severing two undersea fiber-optic cables connecting Germany to Finland and Lithuania to Sweden. During a meeting of Nordic and Baltic leaders, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk proposed a joint maritime policing program among Baltic Sea nations to safeguard their undersea infrastructure from external security threats. Meanwhile, Finland detained the Russian-linked tanker Eagle S, which had been part of a shadow Russian fleet transporting sanctioned oil. The tanker had dragged its anchor over 100 kilometers, damaging the Estonia-Finland Estlink 2 and four telecommunications cables. In response, NATO countries in the Baltic Sea have established an international fleet tasked with countering unusual vessel activities near energy and communication infrastructure. While these forces are not equipped to control the entire seabed of the Baltic Sea, their presence signals to Russia and China that sabotage attempts will provoke a response, and perpetrators will not easily escape the sites of sabotage. It is clear who stands to benefit from these acts of sabotage, with Moscow being the main suspect. However, the question remains: who is directly responsible? Is it the shipping companies employing untrained crews for the shadow Russian tanker fleet violating sanctions, or is it Russian intelligence services seeking to enable sabotage and create favorable conditions for it? Furthermore, with the return of U.S. President Donald Trump to office, questions may arise about Europe&#x2019;s ongoing collaboration with Chinese companies in laying undersea telecommunications cables, which could jeopardize data security. For example, the Chinese company Huawei Marine Networks (HMN) Tech operates a cable connecting Singapore to Marseille, France, which went live in December 2022. The strategic cooperation between China and Russia, aimed at undermining NATO and EU countries, is well known. Therefore, principles to mitigate the threats posed by these countries must be consistently upheld and not ignored.

12 injured, including children, in Russian attack on Kramatorsk	Editor note: This story is being updated with the latest data on the people injured. Russian forces attacked the city of Kramatorsk in Donetsk Oblast, injuring at least 12 people, including two children, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on Jan. 30. According to preliminary information, the victims include an 8-year-old boy and a 7-year-old girl. Local authorities are assessing the aftermath of the attack. Filashkin did not specify the weapon Russia used. Russian artillery and aerial strikes against Donetsk Oblast settlements occur daily, frequently resulting in civilian casualties. Kramatorsk, a key district center, lies about 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of the front line and remains a primary target amid Russia&apos;s ongoing offensive push in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-kramatorsk-injures-at-least-five-including-two-children/	2025-01-30T03:37:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/475255784_2091539797986022_8396434578944005302_n.jpg
Russia's Soviet-era military stockpile running low, faces equipment shortages, media reports	Russia has depleted much of its Soviet-era military-industrial stockpile, with remaining equipment in poor condition, the independent media outlet The Insider reported on Jan. 28. The Russian military has lost more than half of its available equipment, and unless an unexpected shift occurs, hostilities could gradually fade by late 2025 or early 2026 due to a shortage of tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery, the publication claims. This comes as U.S. President Donald Trump urged Russia to &quot;make a deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin has since said Moscow is ready to hold talks with Trump. The Insider reported that both Russian and Ukrainian forces are primarily losing Soviet-era equipment, with Russian losses now accounting for about 50% of its total stock. Much of the remaining equipment in storage is in poor technical condition, making it unlikely to be repaired and deployed to the front lines. The number of combat-ready vehicles Russia could still send to the front is estimated at around 2,000 tanks, 2,000 infantry fighting vehicles (BMPs), and 3,000 armored personnel carriers (APCs). Moscow is also reportedly facing production limitations. The only infantry fighting vehicle in large-scale production remains the BMP-3, with 463 units produced in 2023. Modern BTR-82 armored personnel carrier production is estimated at 300&#x2013;400 units annually. The decline in Russia&apos;s equipment stockpile coincides with a slowdown in assault operations in Ukraine, though fighting remains intense, according to the monitoring group DeepState. As of late January, 44% of Russian attacks have been concentrated in the Pokrovsk sector, a key logistics hub for Ukrainian forces in Donetsk Oblast. The peak of Russia&apos;s offensives occurred in December, following a surge in late November. Amid these trends, U.S. peace envoy Keith Kellogg suggested on Jan. 24 that tighter restrictions on Russia&apos;s oil industry could pressure the Kremlin to negotiate. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov earlier on Dec. 29 expressed dissatisfaction with Trump&apos;s team&apos;s reported peace proposals, particularly the idea of freezing hostilities along the current line of contact. Putin later reiterated his claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has &quot;no right to sign any documents&quot; in potential negotiations, reaffirming that Russia is prepared to hold talks with Trump.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-facing-equipment-shortages-media-reported/	2025-01-30T03:19:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1870879319.jpg
PACE refuses to register draft resolution amendment branding Putin terrorist	The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe&apos;s (PACE) table office has refused to register a draft amendment calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a terrorist, Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksandr Merezhko, the amendment&apos;s co-author, confirmed for the Kyiv Independent on Jan. 30. Merezhko and other co-authors, including five Ukrainian representatives and Swedish MP Markus Wiechel, proposed the amendment as part of PACE&apos;s planned resolution on &quot;Europe&apos;s Commitment to a Just and Sustainable Peace in Ukraine,&quot; European Pravda reported earlier the same day. After all the submitted amendments were published, Merezhko&apos;s proposal was not among them. PACE&apos;s table office explained its decision by saying that &quot;calling Putin a terrorist is against the rule of procedure because it &apos;insults his dignity,&apos;&quot;Merezhko told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The Table Office is obliged to rule this amendment out of order as designating a Head of State as a terrorist is tantamount to using offensive and insulting terms that are inappropriate in an official Assembly document,&quot; the official reply by the table office read. &quot;I absolutely disagree with such misinterpretation of the PACE&#x2019;s rules of procedure, because the term &apos;terrorist&apos; is not an insult, it&#x2019;s a legal term used in international legal documents, including international treaties,&quot; Merezhko commented. The lawmaker also pointed out that a previous PACE resolution recognizes Russia as a &quot;terrorist regime,&quot; adding that the issue should have been resolved by voting among PACE members, not with a decision by the table office. Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, which nears its third anniversary, has been accompanied by widespread destruction of Ukrainian residential areas and infrastructure, heavy civilian casualties, and numerous cases of torture and repression in the occupied territories. &quot;In my opinion, what happened is an act of political censorship which undermines the reputation of PACE and the Council of Europe,&quot; Merezhko said. PACE is the parliamentary arm of the Council of Europe, an international organization of 46 countries, including Ukraine, that promotes democratic values and human rights. Russia was expelled from the body in early 2022 in response to its invasion of Ukraine. The assembly has issued a number of resolutions regarding Russia during the full-scale war, calling for the establishment of an international special tribunal to hold Russia accountable for war crimes and recognizing Putin as an illegitimate dictator.

Russian figure skating champions reportedly on board plane crashed in Washington	Russian world figure skating champions Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova were on board the American Airlines plane that crashed in Washington, DC, on Jan. 29, Russian state news agency TASS reported, citing its sources. The plane crashed into a military helicopter while landing at the Washington airport. There were 64 people on the plane. In the first hours after the crash, rescuers found no survivors. The plane was flying from Wichita, Kansas, where the U.S. Figure Skating Championships and the National Development Camp for athletes and coaches were taking place. Shishkova and Naumov&apos;s son Maxim, who competes for the U.S. national figure skating team, was also allegedly on board the plane, the Russian Telegram channel Shot reported. Inna Volyanskaya, a bronze medalist of the USSR championship in pairs skating, was among the passengers as well, a source told TASS. Most of the skaters on the plane were &quot;children of Russian immigrants,&quot; the Russian Telegram channel Mash reported. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-world-figure-skating-champions-were-on-board-plane-crashed-in-washington/	2025-01-30T01:58:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2196058296.jpg
Romania's presidential candidate Georgescu calls Ukraine 'fictional state,' suggests annexing territory	Far-right Romanian politician Calin Georgescu called Ukraine a &quot;fictional state&quot; and claimed that the eventual partition of its territories is &quot;inevitable&quot; in an interview published on Jan. 29. &quot;On 100% it will happen,&quot; Calin Georgescu said in the interview with journalist Ion Cristoiu about redrawing Ukraine&apos;s borders as a consequence of the Russia-Ukraine war, suggesting Romania could claim some of Ukraine&apos;s territories. &quot;The path to something like this is inevitable. Ukraine is a fictional state... the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.&quot; The obscure, pro-Russian ultranationalist achieved a shock success during the first round of a presidential vote in November 2024, making him a front-runner for the second round. The results were annulled by the constitutional court over alleged Russian interference and a hybrid campaign on TikTok meant to prop up Georgescu. The far-right politician, who has opposed military support for Ukraine and the transit of Ukrainian grain through Romania, remains the leading candidate for the rescheduled vote in May with 38% of projected support. &quot;The world is changing. Borders will change... If borders change, where are we? We have an interest in Northern Bukovina. We have Budjak, we have Northern Maramures, the former Transcarpathia... there are still Hungarians,&quot; Georgescu said, referring to Ukrainian regions bordering Romania. The politician further suggested that Poland would annex Lviv, echoing tropes commonly employed by Russian propaganda about a post-war division of Ukraine. Georgescu is not the first far-right Romanian politician to suggest annexing parts of Ukraine&apos;s territory in the wake of Russia&apos;s war. Claudiu Tarziu, a member of the far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) party, and Diana Sosoaca, the leader of the pro-Russian SOS Romania party, made similar comments. There are an estimated 150,000-500,000 ethnic Romanians living in Ukraine, concentrated in the border regions. The current Romanian leadership has been staunchly pro-Ukrainian throughout the full-scale war, providing military aid that included a Patriot air defense system, housing a training facility for Ukrainian F-16 pilots, and facilitating the transit of Ukrainian agricultural products. During the interview, Georgescu also said that U.S. President Donald Trump will seek to cut a quick deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine, meaning Bucharest will no longer have to provide assistance to Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/romanias-presidential-candidate-calls-ukraine-fictional-state-suggests-annexing-territory/	2025-01-30T01:42:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187159702.jpg
Russian oligarch Abramovich underpays $1.2 billion to UK in taxes, media investigation says	Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich owes up to 1 billion pounds ($1.2 billion) to the U.K. after attempting to evade taxes on hedge funds investments in a scheme involving Chelsea Football Club, according to a joint investigation by the BBC, The Guardian, and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism published on Jan. 29. Abramovich had amassed extensive wealth in the U.K. and formerly owned Chelsea, a Premier League football club in London. The billionaire was forced to sell the club and was banned entry to the U.K. in 2022 due to his connections to Russian President Vladimir Putin. From 1990 until 2020, Abramovich invested about $6 billion in Keygrove Holdings Ltd, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands. Meanwhile, a network of companies owned by Keygrove and registered in the same jurisdiction invested the money in Western hedge funds, the investigation read, citing leaked documents. Abramovich reportedly made $3.8 billion from the investments. The central figure in the scheme was said to be Eugene Shvidler, a billionaire and Chelsea&apos;s former director. Shvidler is currently under sanctions due to his ties to Abramovich. The directors of the companies registered in the British Virgin Islands allegedly gave Schwiller broad powers to manage them. He then lived in the U.K. and became a British citizen in 2010. If companies are run by a person based in the U.K., profits should be taxed as if they were a U.K. company, the BBC wrote. Beginning in 2008, Shvidler was authorized to manage Keygrove&apos;s investments, which owned companies in the British Virgin Islands, through another company, the investigation read. According to the leaked documents, significant amounts of tax-free profits from Abramovich&apos;s hedge fund investments flowed through a network of companies before ending up at FC Chelsea. Thus, the hedge fund investments flowed back to British Virgin Islands companies and Keygrove. Keygrove then loaned money to other Abramovich companies, which then lent money to Camberley International Investments Ltd, the company set up to finance Chelsea. The article came as part of the joint Cyprus Confidential investigation into files leaked in 2023 led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and Paper Trail Media. Previously, the first part of the investigation by the BBC, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, and The Guardian revealed that the Cypriot company Blue Ocean Yacht Management, owned by Abramovich, created a fictitious business of renting superyachts used by the entrepreneur himself to evade taxes. From 2005 to 2012, Abramovich did not pay tens of millions of euros in taxes in this way, according to journalists. Abramovich&apos;s net worth is estimated to be around $9 billion, and he has Russian, Israeli, and Portuguese citizenship. He and other top Russian oligarchs were sanctioned after the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The oligarch now resides alternatively in Tel Aviv, Istanbul, and Russia&apos;s Sochi.	https://kyivindependent.com/abramovich-owes-billion-to-uk-in-taxes-media-says/	2025-01-30T00:49:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-630266674.jpg
8 killed, 26 injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least eight people and injured at least 26, including a child and three medical workers, regional authorities reported on Jan. 30. Russia launched 81 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force said. Thirty-seven were shot down over 10 oblasts, while 39 were lost in the airspace, according to the statement. A Russian drone struck a residential building in the northeastern city of Sumy in Sumy Oblast overnight on Jan. 30, killing four people and injuring at least nine others, local authorities reported. A 7-year-old child was injured, as well as an 18-year-old man. In the same region, a civilian was injured during a drone attack against the Hlukhiv community on Jan. 29, authorities said. Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast killed one person in Siversk, injured two in Pokrovsk, and two others in Bilytske, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. A Russian first-person-view (FPV) drone attack injured three medical workers in the town of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. A 43-year-old ambulance driver, a 26-year-old doctor, and a 41-year-old medic were injured after the drone struck close to the vehicle. Three people were killed and 10 injured as a result of Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. Three apartment buildings and 22 houses were damaged. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian attacks against the Synelnykove district destroyed a school, damaged a cultural center, a religious building, an administrative building, a post office, a shop, a company building, and 22 houses, Governor Serhii Lysak said. No casualties were reported. Russian drones also attacked the Izmail district in Odesa Oblast, damaging a grain warehouse, a hospital, two houses, and cars but inflicting no casualties, Governor Oleh Kiper reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/8-killed-26-injured-in-russian-attacks-across-ukraine-over-past-day/	2025-01-29T23:41:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-30_08-34-51.jpg
EU debates restarting Russian gas purchases as part of Ukraine peace deal, FT reports	EU officials are discussing the option of resuming purchases of Russian pipeline gas as part of a potential settlement of the Russia-Ukraine war, the Financial Times reported on Jan. 30, citing undisclosed sources. The proposal&apos;s advocates, including Hungarian and German officials, argue that the move could give both Russia and Europe incentives to maintain a peace deal while stabilizing the continent&apos;s energy market, the outlet wrote. The news comes almost a month after Ukraine halted the transit of Russian gas through its territory to the EU, putting an end to a scheme dating back to Soviet times. The decision has sparked protests from some EU members &#x2014; Slovakia and Hungary &#x2014; who continue to rely on Russian gas despite the bloc&apos;s efforts at diversifying supplies. According to the FT, the proposal to resume Russian gas purchases has faced backlash from Ukraine&apos;s chief allies within the EU and officials from some &quot;eastern&quot; member states. While most of the Russian pipeline gas flow to Europe came to a halt, European countries continue to buy Russian liquified natural gas (LNG). The TurkStream line remains the last operational pipeline connection funneling Russian gas to the EU. Earlier this week, Hungary announced it had received &quot;requested guarantees&quot; from the EU on securing energy transit to European countries after threatening to veto sanctions against Moscow. Shortly after, Reuters reported that the European Commission will continue leading talks on gas supplies with Ukraine, Slovakia, and Hungary. Before the full-scale war, Russian pipeline gas represented roughly 40% of the EU&apos;s overall purchases, with Germany being the chief buyer. Fossil fuel exports represent a key portion of Russia&apos;s state revenue and help fuel Moscow&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine, leading to calls among Kyiv&apos;s partners to phase out the purchases completely. The EU cut all Russian coal imports, most Russian oil imports, and over two-thirds of Russian gas imports to the EU, a Commission spokesperson said earlier in January. The EU aims to eliminate all Russian fossil fuels from its market by 2027. U.S. President Donald Trump, who pledged to broker a peace settlement in Ukraine, urged Europe to purchase more American LNG and called for increasing oil production to push down the prices and stifle Russia&apos;s revenues, thus forcing it to the negotiating table.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-mulls-restarting-russian-gas-purchases-as-part-of-ukraine-peace-deal-ft-reports/	2025-01-29T22:54:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1246203218.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 835,940 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 835,940 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 30. This number includes 1,270 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,890 tanks, 20,614 armored fighting vehicles, 35,451 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,412 artillery systems, 1,264 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,050 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 23,510 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-835-940-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-29T22:21:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/LEM_16453-1.jpg
Syrian rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa named transitional president	Ahmad al-Sharaa, the leader of the main rebel group who led the overthrow of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, has been named Syria&apos;s transitional president, the country&apos;s military command announced on Jan. 29. &#x201C;We announce the appointment of Commander Ahmad al-Sharaa as head of state during the transitional period. He will assume the duties of the president of the Syrian Arab Republic and represent the country in international forums,&#x201D; the Syria Military Operations Command said in a statement. &#x201C;The president is authorized to form a temporary legislative council for the transitional phase, which will carry out its duties until a permanent constitution is enacted and put into effect,&#x201D; the statement added. Once a member of al Qaeda, al-Sharaa&apos;s rebel group broke away from the terrorist organization in 2016 to help lead efforts to oust Assad during the country&apos;s decade-long civil war. Given al-Sharaa&apos;s past ties, Western officials have remained cautious about the transitional president&apos;s intentions as he attempts to rebuild a war-torn society. &quot;While we aim to move fast, the lifting of sanctions can be reversed if wrong steps are taken,&quot; EU chief diplomat Kaja Kallas posted on X on Jan. 27, adding that the EU plans to scale up humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts in Syria.&quot; Al-Sharaa, who has served as the country&apos;s de-facto leader since the fall of Assad in December, has distanced the country from its previous ties with Russia &#x2014; including blocking the withdrawal of Russian military equipment, demanding compensation from Russia for the country&apos;s &quot;past mistakes&quot; in Syria, and calling on the Kremlin to hand over Assad from Russian asylum. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha visited Damascus on Dec. 30 for a meeting with al-Sharaa, in which Sybiha expressed Ukraine holds a &quot;similar view&quot; on Russian military presence in Syria. During his visit, Sybiha emphasized that Ukraine is ready to restore diplomatic ties, trade, and educational exchanges with Syria if the country&apos;s new leadership respects international law and its territorial integrity.	https://kyivindependent.com/syrian-rebel-leader-ahmad-al-sharaa-named-transitional-president/	2025-01-29T20:35:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/1000000495.jpg
EU not considering banning Russian LNG until it secures alternatives, Reuters reports	The European Commission will not propose implementing a ban on Russian liquified natural gas (LNG) imports in its upcoming sanctions package amid concern among member states about first securing an alternative from other countries, including the United States, EU diplomats told Reuters on Jan. 29. Following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Europe began to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels to avoid financing the Kremlin&#x2019;s war chest. Despite these efforts, Europe&apos;s imports of Russian LNG, which is largely not subject to sanctions, have soared to record levels in 2024. &quot;First you have to have a deal because otherwise you will be left without gas from Russia and without the U.S.,&quot; one diplomat told Reuters. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen suggested replacing Russian LNG with U.S. exports in a phone conversation with U.S. President Donald Trump on Nov. 8. On Jan. 23, Trump said he would guarantee supplies of U.S. LNG to Europe, although he did not provide a timeline or specify the amount of exports. &quot;The general idea was floated by the Commission in confessionals in order to test the waters... Apparently one or more member (states) signalled enough opposition for the Commission not to deem it opportune to propose such a measure now,&quot; another European diplomat told Reuters. Bloomberg reported on Jan. 14, citing undisclosed officials, that the EU was considering a gradual ban on Russian LNG, but eventually settled on proposing new restrictions on Russian aluminum as part of its next round of sanctions. On Jan 28, the Financial Times (FT) reported, citing a report by Belgian, German, and Ukrainian NGOs, that German imports of Russian LNG via other EU countries continue to rise despite restrictions on direct shipments. According to FT, Belgium, Spain, and France receive Russian LNG cargos, which they later re-export to other countries. This makes it difficult to trace the origin and allows Germany to import Russian LNG even after banning its ports from receiving Russian LNG shipments. The European Union imposed its first major restrictions on Russian gas, including LNG, in its 14th sanctions package in June. Russia still remains Europe&apos;s second-largest importer of LNG, after the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-not-considering-banning-russian-lng-until-it-secures-alternatives-reuters-reports/	2025-01-29T18:54:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1259161176.jpg
Russian drone attack on residential building in Sumy injures 7, including child	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A Russian drone struck a residential building in the northeastern city of Sumy overnight on Jan. 30, injuring at least seven people, local authorities reported. Conflicting reports by local officials initially indicated that one person was killed in the attack, although the Kyiv Independent cannot immediately verify the reports. A Shahed-type attack drone hit a multistory building in the city, Acting Regional Governor Volodymyr Artiukh said. During the strike a 7-year-old child was injured, as well as an 18-year-old man. No additional information was provided as to the identity of the remaining victims. Emergency rescue workers are currently on-scene, searching for potentially more victims under the rubble. Some of the injured victims have been hospitalized and are reported to be in serious condition. Videos posted of the attack show significant damage to the building, seemingly between the sixth and seventh floors of the building. Situated on the Ukraine-Russia border, the city of Sumy and surrounding region have continuously come under attack since the launch of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Throughout the day on Jan. 29, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration reported 106 separate attacks on the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-attack-in-sumy-kills-1-injures-3-including-child/	2025-01-29T17:36:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/1000000490.jpg
Georgia withdraws from PACE, calls demands for new elections 'blackmail'	Georgia withdrew its delegation from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) on Jan. 29 after the Assembly passed a resolution calling for Tbilisi to hold new parliamentary elections. The country&apos;s fall 2024 parliamentary elections sparked mass protests and political turmoil, with the pro-Russian Georgian Dream party declaring a sweeping victory as opposition groups and international monitors pointed to evidence of widespread fraud. PACE on Jan. 29 adopted a resolution calling on the Georgian government to hold &quot;new genuinely democratic parliamentary elections,&quot; Assembly President Theodoros Rousopoulos said in a statement. The resolution stipulated that the credentials of the Georgian delegates would be reviewed and potentially revoked if the government did not take these measures. PACE had previously ratified the Georgian delegation&apos;s credentials, but suspended some of the members&apos; rights due to evidence of &quot;democratic backsliding.&quot; The new resolution applies conditions for the future ratification of Georgia&apos;s credentials. Besides new elections, the resolution also calls for the release of all political prisoners and immediate steps to resume the process of Georgia&apos;s integration into the European Union. In response to the vote, Georgia announced the withdrawal of its delegates from PACE. &quot;We believe that as long as the completely unjust and unfounded blackmail against the government elected by the Georgian people continues ... the participation of our parliamentary delegation in the Assembly has no meaning or justification,&quot; Teia Tsulukiani, the head of the Georgian parliamentary delegation, said in a statement to reporters. Georgia remains a member of the Council of Europe but will not resume work with PACE until &quot;the blackmail ends&quot; and the Assembly &quot;changes its unfair attitude towards the Georgian state,&quot; Tsulukiani said. PACE President Rousopoulos said he regretted the delegation&apos;s decision. &quot;I regret the decision of the Georgian delegation to withdraw from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe following the Assembly&apos;s vote tonight to ratify the delegation&apos;s credentials, subject to conditions,&quot; Rousopoulos said. &quot;This jeopardizes the dialogue that could help to advance democratic standards in Georgia.&quot; Under the leadership of the ruling Georgian Dream party, founded by oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, Tbilisi has moved closer to Russia and stalled its accession to the EU. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced in November 2024 that Georgia&apos;s EU integration could be delayed until 2028. The statement kicked off a fresh round of demonstrations across the country. Georgia has incurred sanctions, including visa restrictions, from the U.S., E.U., and Ukraine due to its apparent anti-democratic trajectory. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/georgia-withdraws-from-pace-calls-demands-for-new-elections-blackmail/	2025-01-29T15:47:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/PACEGeorgia.png
NATO on track to send Kyiv over $40 billion in 2025	The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is on course to fulfill its promise to send approximately $41.6 billion (40 billion euros) in security assistance to Ukraine by the end of the year, NATO Deputy Secretary General Radmila Shekerinska said on Jan. 29. Member nations pledged to provide the funding to Ukraine during the NATO summit in Washington, D.C. in July 2024. Shekerinska discussed the status of the funds during a meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council in Brussels. Ukraine&apos;s Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna attended the meeting. &quot;Allies are on track to deliver on the pledge made at the Washington summit,&quot; a NATO press statement said. Stefanishyna also met with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte during her visit to Brussels. Their discussions centered on the current situation on the front lines, Ukraine&apos;s ongoing reform efforts, and continued NATO support for Ukraine&apos;s defense. Rutte has pledged to maintain the alliance&apos;s support for Kyiv and increase Europe&apos;s share of the spending amid the U.S. government transition. NATO has already moved into a new leadership position in coordinating aid for Ukraine, taking over certain responsibilities once handled by the U.S. The future of U.S. military aid remains uncertain under President Donald Trump, who has urged Europe to shoulder more of the financial burden. Ukraine continues to prioritize its future NATO membership as an essential security guarantee in the face of Russian aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-on-track-to-send-kyiv-over-40-billion-in-2025/	2025-01-29T14:35:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/nato.jpeg
Zelensky looks to domestic, EU funders for key projects amid US aid freeze	President Volodymyr Zelensky has directed the government to identify domestic and European funding sources for key projects in energy infrastructure, veterans&apos; affairs, and border checkpoints during the 90-day freeze on U.S. foreign aid. U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his inauguration day suspending foreign assistance programs for 90 days, jeopardizing many critical humanitarian aid projects in Ukraine. &quot;I have already instructed some key things to be done at our own expense, as well as to talk to the Europeans,&quot; Zelensky said on Jan. 29, following an initial report on suspended U.S.-funded programs in Ukraine. The president on Jan. 28 ordered government officials to review and report on the state of these programs. Following the initial report, Zelensky said the government was prioritizing programs concerning the energy sector, military veterans, and border crossings. The president also mentioned issues with the Health Ministry and cybersecurity. &quot;We are dealing with all this,&quot; he said. According to Zelensky, U.S. funding supports many energy &quot;resilience programs&quot; in Ukrainian cities and villages. Ukraine&apos;s energy sector is struggling to rebuild in the face of targeted Russian attacks on critical infrastructure. In December 2024, Russia carried out one of its largest assaults on Ukraine&apos;s electric grid, launching 90 missiles and 200 drones against the country&apos;s thermal power plants. The announcement of Trump&apos;s aid freeze sparked fears that it would help Russia&apos;s efforts to destroy the power grid. &quot;Does that mean that we will abandon Ukraine in the middle of winter? Because USAID has been providing critical funding for the rebuilding of their electric grid every time Russia attacks it,&quot; U.S. Senator Chris Coons said in response to the order. Regarding veterans, Zelensky said U.S. aid funded veteran hubs, support lines, and other projects, including a program that helped veterans start their own businesses. U.S. funding also contributed to the modernization of border crossings in Ukraine. &quot;New modern checkpoints are built to make economic activity faster and the work of customs officers more transparent,&quot; the president said. Zelensky said that Ukraine and European partners needed to work together to cover the funding gaps over the next 90 days. The announcement comes as Ukrainian lawmakers say they are consulting with European counterparts on temporarily replacing U.S. aid. &quot;(T)here should be more of our and European activity in the humanitarian, security, and social areas,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;We need to support people now, while a new American policy is being developed.&quot; The pause on foreign aid does not apply to military assistance to Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also signed a waiver on Jan. 28 that grants &quot;life-saving humanitarian assistance&quot; an exception to the pause. The exception applies to &quot;core life-saving medicine, medical services, food, shelter, and subsistence assistance, as well as supplies and reasonable administrative costs as necessary to deliver such assistance,&quot; according to the waiver.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-looks-to-domestic-eu-funders-for-key-projects-amid-us-aid-freeze/	2025-01-29T13:16:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164821112.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukrainian drones hit Lukoil oil refinery, missile arsenal in Russia, sources claim	Key developments on Jan. 29: Ukrainian drones hit the Andreapol oil pumping station and missile arsenal in Russia&apos;s Tver Oblast overnight on Jan. 29, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. Drone strikes were reported by local officials across several Russian regions overnight, including Nizhny Novgorod, Smolensk, Tver, and Bryansk oblasts, causing fires and prompting air defense responses. Drones operated by the SBU and the Special Operations Forces attacked the oil pumping station, which is part of the Baltic Pipeline System-2 operated by Russian state-owned oil pipeline company Transneft. According to the source, the filtration pumping area and additive tanks at the station were damaged. The station is located around 750 kilometers (466 miles) north of Ukrainian border. A spill of oil products and a fire were reported at the station. &quot;The Russians even had to shut down the main pipeline that supplies oil to the Ust-Luga terminal in Leningrad Oblast,&quot; the source said. Ukrainian drones also hit the 23rd missile arsenal of the Russian Defense Ministry in Tver Oblast. The depot and three buildings of the military unit came under the attack, the source claimed. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. A Lukoil oil refinery in the Russian oblast of Nizhny Novgorod was struck by multiple Ukrainian drones in the early hours of Jan. 29, a military intelligence (HUR) source told the Kyiv Independent. According to the HUR source, the Lukoil oil depot in the city of Kstovo was targeted by four drones, all of which struck their target and caused &quot;significant damage.&quot; They added the refinery &quot;supports the activities of the Russian occupation forces&quot; and was &quot;attacked at around midnight local time.&quot; The refinery is located around 800 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims, but overnight local Telegram channels reported that drones targeted the Lukoil Nizhegorodnefteorgsintez oil refinery, resulting in a large fire. Video footage circulating online showed flames at the facility, which local monitoring channels identified as the likely target of the attack. Governor Gleb Nikitin confirmed that air defense systems had shot down multiple drones, and fragments from the intercepted unmanned aerial vehicles fell on the industrial site. No injuries were reported. The intensity of Russian assault operations in Ukraine is declining but remains high, according to an analysis by the monitoring group DeepState, published on Jan. 28. Russian forces have concentrated 44% of their attacks in the Pokrovsk sector, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian troops in Donetsk Oblast. The peak intensity of Russian offensives was recorded in the second half of December, following a surge in attacks that began in late November. Although the pace has slowed somewhat since the New Year, DeepState recorded the following attack numbers: 5,205 in November, 6,247 in December, and 4,304 in January as of Jan. 27. Despite suffering heavy losses, Russian forces have reportedly been able to replenish their combat strength, allowing them to sustain attacks across multiple front-line sectors. As part of this effort, Russia has intensified assaults near Pokrovsk, deploying small groups in an attempt to encircle Ukrainian troops, Viktor Trehubov, spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces, said on Jan. 27. The estimated Russian advance in the Pokrovsk sector in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 29, 2025, according to DeepState map. A white symbol marks Pokrovsk. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)The town of Kurakhove has also been a target. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 6 that its forces had fully captured the settlement, though Ukraine has not confirmed this. Russian forces also claimed on Jan. 26 to have captured Velyka Novosilka, a strategically significant settlement in the western part of Donetsk Oblast. Ukraine&apos;s 110th Mechanized Brigade acknowledged withdrawing from parts of the village to avoid encirclement. An Australian volunteer soldier fighting for Ukraine who was reported to have been executed by Russian forces after being taken prisoner is alive, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on Jan. 29. &quot;The Australian government has received confirmation from Russia that Oscar Jenkins is alive and in custody,&quot; she said in comments reported by The Guardian. Jenkins is serving in the 402nd Separate Rifle Battalion, which is part of Ukraine&apos;s 66th Separate Mechanized Brigade, the Ukrainian investigative journalism outlet Slidstvo.Info reported on Jan. 17. He went missing on Dec. 16 in 2024 while on a combat mission near the village of Mykolaivka in Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces Command told the outlet. In a video that emerged on Russian Telegram channels in late December, Jenkins is seen in military fatigues, interrogated by Russian captors. The man behind the camera asks the captive about his name and background and whether he wants to live while beating him over the head. Unverified reports began circulating in mid-January that the soldier was executed by his Russian captors, prompting Australian officials to make urgent inquiries to Russia about his whereabouts. &quot;We still hold serious concerns for Mr. Jenkins as a prisoner of war,&quot; Wong said, adding: &quot;We have made clear to Russia in Canberra and in Moscow that Mr. Jenkins is a prisoner of war and Russia is obligated to treat him in accordance with international humanitarian law, including humane treatment.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukrainian-drones-hit-lukoil-oil-refinery-missile-arsenal-in-russia-sources-claim/	2025-01-29T11:47:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-459985760.jpg
Slovakia summons Ukrainian ambassador over Zelensky's criticism of Russian gas purchases	The Slovak Foreign Ministry summoned Ukrainian Ambassador to Bratislava Myroslav Kastran on Jan. 29 after Kyiv criticized the country&apos;s Prime Minister Robert Fico for wanting to continue Russian gas supplies to Slovakia, it said on social media. The move came as relations between Fico and President Volodymyr Zelensky have become increasingly tense over this month. In his recent remarks on Jan. 28, the Slovak prime minister called Zelensky &quot;the enemy&quot; of Slovakia. &quot;Many in Europe... have chosen to preserve their independence and sovereignty. But not Mr. Fico. He chooses Moscow over America and other partners who can supply his country with gas on commercial terms. This is his mistake,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s president said in response. According to the ministry&apos;s statement, the Slovak ministry delivered the Ukrainian ambassador &quot;a strong protest&quot; against statements by the Ukrainian side, without specifying which ones. &#xA0; &quot;(These statements) are considered interference in the internal affairs of the Slovak Republic,&quot; the ministry said. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry is yet to comment on this move. Fico, a pro-Russian politician who has long opposed military aid to Ukraine, has escalated threats against Kyiv following the termination of Russian gas transit via Ukrainian territory on Jan. 1. He has threatened to limit aid to Ukrainians and cut off electricity supplies amid an energy crisis brought on by Russia&apos;s relentless attacks against Ukraine&apos;s power grid. As tensions mount, Zelensky and Fico signaled in mid-January they may hold talks. Fico&apos;s friendliness towards the Kremlin has sparked outrage both at home and abroad. His meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow in December drew condemnation from other European leaders. Mass protests erupted in Bratislava in early January, with thousands chanting &quot;We are not Russia.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/slovakia-summons-ukrainian-ambassador-after/	2025-01-29T11:15:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1204098217.jpg
Polish envoy on moving past painful history with Ukraine	The Kyiv Independent&apos;s Martin Fornusek sat down with Poland&apos;s charge d&apos;affairs in Kyiv, Piotr Lukasiewicz, to discuss why Poland stands out among Ukraine&apos;s allies, how to approach the most painful chapters of the shared Polish-Ukrainian history, and why it may be too early to discuss a ceasefire with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-envoy-on-moving-past-painful-history-with-ukraine/	2025-01-29T10:26:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/IMG_9627.JPG
Nearly 100 companies in Ukraine quietly change Russian ownership in 6 months, monitoring service reports	Within the last six months, 93 companies in Ukraine have removed signs of Russian ownership and continue to do business in the country, despite a moratorium on altering the registration of companies with Russian owners, the monitoring service Opendatabot reported. In response to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine adopted a law to allow the seizure of assets or property in Ukraine owned by Russia or Russian citizens. As part of the law, Russian-owned or linked companies were barred from reregistering their ownership, with some exceptions. Despite the ban, some companies have found ways to remove their Russian owners to continue operating. Opendatabot also found that some of these companies have participated in public procurement tenders. Opendatabot reported that a manufacturing and clothing distribution company with Russian ties, Texter Ltd., won seven tenders totaling Hr 19.6 million ($467,777). Welesgard LLC, a business consulting firm, won contracts worth Hr 19.3 million ($459,633), and tech retailer Era Mobile received 37 tenders totaling Hr 1.9 million ($45,248). In 2023, 12 companies with Russian ties earned over Hr 10 million ($238,421), Opendatabot said. Nearly half earned less, while others filed no reports. Over 18,000 companies in Ukraine had Russian ties at the start of the full-scale invasion, according to Opendatabot. By May 2024, 621 companies had allegedly altered ownership records to bypass legal restrictions. The monitoring service said it has sent a request to the Justice Ministry to verify the legality of the re-registrations. In response to an inquiry from the Kyiv Independent, the Justice Ministry said it had checked all 621 companies and found violations in the registration of 14 companies, two of which were related to non-compliance with restrictions on Russian assets. Opendatabot also said it had already contacted the ministry earlier last year with information about companies that had changed their registration illegally. As a result of the inquiry, the Justice Ministry conducted 10 inspections, eight of which were found to have illegally altered their registration.	https://kyivindependent.com/nearly-100-companies-in-ukraine-quietly-change-russian-ownership-in-6-months-monitoring-service-reports/	2025-01-29T09:50:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1626071568.jpg
Ukrainian lawmakers seek to temporarily replace USAID with European funding	Ukraine&apos;s parliamentary humanitarian and information policy committee launched consultations with their European counterparts on a temporary replacement of American funding under the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the committee announced on Jan. 29. U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his inauguration day suspending foreign aid programs for 90 days so they can be reviewed to ensure they align with &quot;American interests&quot; and &quot;American values.&quot; The pause in funding could last for three to six months, according to the committee&apos;s statement. In Ukraine, the organizations affected provide a huge range of humanitarian services, including counseling, organizing cultural events, and providing basic services, often to some of the most vulnerable segments of society. Agricultural and reconstruction projects, as well as energy infrastructure repairs have also been put on hold due to the decision. A number of Ukrainian independent media were also left without critical funding. &quot;While the audit is ongoing, Ukraine must take prompt action to avoid destabilizing key processes in the country, as well as to foresee its actions in this direction in the future,&quot; the committee said. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that he had ordered a report on U.S.-funded projects in Ukraine affected the freeze on foreign assistance. &quot;USAID&apos;s assistance is an important part of (Ukraine&apos;s) path to democratic development and sustainability, especially in the current geopolitical environment,&quot; the committee added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-lawmakers-seek-to-temporarily-replace-usaid-with-european-funding/	2025-01-29T09:24:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2076700622.jpg
Finland, Ukraine develop warfare drone, media reports	Finnish company Insta presented a Steel Eagle drone, developed in cooperation with Ukraine, the Finnish broadcaster Yle reported on Jan. 29. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks by Ukraine&apos;s military since the start of the full-scale invasion. The Finnish-Ukrainian drone is equipped with a radio control system, a transfer function, as well as VR goggles for a pilot. It is said to have a long range and be resistant to interference. The company describes the system as a combination of an &quot;explosive charge and a drone.&quot; The drone can be used to transport an explosive charge that can detonate above a target. The explosion of steel and tungsten pellets scatters to the ground and can pierce the roof of a light armored vehicle, according to the manufacturer. According to the Finnish Defense and Aerospace Industry Association, more than 10 defense companies in Finland directly cooperate with Ukrainian companies. Kyiv delivered more than 200,000 domestically-produced drones to front-line units as of the end of 2024, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said.	https://kyivindependent.com/finland-ukraine-develop-warfare-drone/	2025-01-29T08:29:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/--------------2025-01-29-181503.png
Ukrainian drones hit Russian missile arsenal, oil pumping station in Tver Oblast, SBU source claims	Ukrainian drones hit the Andreapol oil pumping station and missile arsenal in Russia&apos;s Tver Oblast overnight on Jan. 29, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. Drones operated by the SBU and the Special Operations Forces attacked the oil pumping station, which is part of the Baltic Pipeline System-2 operated by Russian state-owned oil pipeline company Transneft. According to the source, the filtration pumping area and additive tanks at the station were damaged. The station is located around 750 kilometers (466 miles) north of Ukrainian border. A spill of oil products and a fire were reported at the station. &quot;The Russians even had to shut down the main pipeline that supplies oil to the Ust-Luga terminal in Leningrad Oblast,&quot; the source said. Ukrainian drones also hit the 23rd missile arsenal of the Russian Defense Ministry in Tver Oblast. The depot and three buildings of the military unit came under the attack, the source claimed. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. Earlier in the day, an intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent that multiple Ukrainian drones struck a Lukoil oil refinery in the Russian oblast of Nizhny Novgorod. Kyiv considers oil refineries to be valid military targets, as profits from the fossil fuel industry fund Russia&apos;s war machine. Earlier this week, the Ryazan Oil Refinery in Russia suspended operations due to damage from Ukrainian drone attacks, Reuters reported, citing two industry sources.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-hit-russian-missile-arsenal-oil-pumping-station-in-tver-oblast-sbu-source-claims/	2025-01-29T08:26:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/--------------2025-01-29-181232.png
Syria calls on Russia to hand over Assad, key aides in first post-ouster talks, media reports	Syria&apos;s new government has allegedly requested that Russia hand over former President Bashar al-Assad and his close aides, Reuters reported on Jan. 28, citing a Syrian source close to the matter. The demand was reportedly raised during the first negotiations between Syrian officials and a Kremlin delegation following Assad&apos;s ouster by rebels in December. After his overthrow, Assad fled to Moscow, where he now resides. A Russian delegation led by Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and special envoy Alexander Lavrentyev met with Syria&apos;s de facto leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, who reportedly made the request.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov refused to comment on the report about Syrian demands, Russian state news agency TASS reported. There has been no official statement from Moscow or Damascus regarding the demand. Russia deployed troops to Syria in 2015 to support Assad&apos;s brutal crackdown against opposition forces. With Moscow&apos;s backing, Assad&apos;s regime imprisoned, tortured, and killed hundreds of thousands of Syrians. Syria&apos;s new government pressed Russia for compensation and the correction of &quot;past mistakes&quot; during the Jan. 28 talks as Moscow reassesses its military presence in the country. The Russian delegation was unwilling to concede such mistakes, and the only agreement reached was to continue the discussions, a Syrian source told Reuters. Following Assad&apos;s ouster, Russia began withdrawing assets from Syria, raising questions about the future of its naval base in Tartus and its airbase in Khmeimim. Ukraine has also engaged with Syria&apos;s new leadership. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha visited Damascus on Dec. 30 to discuss Russia&apos;s military presence. Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said Kyiv and Damascus share similar views on the issue, though specific details were not disclosed.	https://kyivindependent.com/syria-calls-on-russia-to-hand-over-assad-key-aides-in-first-post-ouster-talks-media-reports/	2025-01-29T08:07:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188260500.jpg
Russia's 25% military budget hike demands stronger sanctions, more Ukraine aid, PM Shmyhal says	Russia has increased its military budget by 25% in 2025, underscoring the need for stronger sanctions, more weapons, and greater assistance from Ukraine&apos;s international partners, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Jan. 29. &quot;Russia understands only the language of force and is not going to retreat unless we give a worthy response,&quot; Shmyhal said. Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the state budget on Dec. 1, which plans for record levels of military spending over the next three years. Speaking alongside Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic in Zagreb, Shmyhal said that &quot;peace through strength&quot; must guide the response to Russian aggression. He called for further sanctions to weaken Moscow&apos;s economy and expressed gratitude to Croatia for its continued military and technical assistance. The call for tougher measures comes as U.S. President Donald Trump threatens new sanctions and tariffs on Russian exports unless a deal to end the war is reached soon. Targeting Russia&apos;s oil sector could pressure the Kremlin into negotiations, Trump&apos;s incoming peace envoy Keith Kellogg said on Jan. 24. Amid uncertainty over U.S. support for Ukraine under the Trump administration, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte urged Washington to maintain weapons supplies to Kyiv, pledging that Europe would cover the financial burden.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-25-military-budget-hike-demands-stronger-sanctions-more-ukraine-aid-pm-shmyhal-says/	2025-01-29T06:11:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168960387.jpg
Russian assault intensity declines, focus on Pokrovsk sector, monitoring group reports	The intensity of Russian assault operations in Ukraine is declining but remains high, according to an analysis by the monitoring group DeepState, published on Jan. 28. Russian forces have concentrated 44% of their attacks in the Pokrovsk sector, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian troops in Donetsk Oblast. The peak intensity of Russian offensives was recorded in the second half of December, following a surge in attacks that began in late November. Although the pace has slowed somewhat since the New Year, DeepState recorded the following attack numbers: 5,205 in November, 6,247 in December, and 4,304 in January as of Jan. 27. Despite suffering heavy losses, Russian forces have reportedly replenished their combat strength quickly, allowing them to sustain attacks across multiple front-line sectors. As part of this effort, Russia has intensified assaults near Pokrovsk, deploying small groups in an attempt to encircle Ukrainian troops, Viktor Trehubov, spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces, said on Jan. 27.

(DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)The town of Kurakhove has also been a target. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 6 that its forces had fully captured the settlement, though Ukraine has not confirmed this. Russian forces also claimed on Jan. 26 to have captured Velyka Novosilka, a strategically significant settlement in the western part of Donetsk Oblast. Ukraine&apos;s 110th Mechanized Brigade acknowledged withdrawing from parts of the village to avoid encirclement. The Kursk sector accounted for 13% of assaults, while 10% occurred in the Lyman sector. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi in November described the ongoing offensive as &quot;one of the most powerful&quot; since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in February 2022. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported continued Russian offensives along multiple axes, including Lyman, Siversk, Kramatorsk, Toretsk, and Kurakhove. Throughout the autumn, Russian forces made operational gains in southern Donetsk Oblast, particularly near Chasiv Yar and Kupiansk. Despite their persistent offensives, Russian forces have not achieved a major breakthrough, while Ukrainian defenses remain under constant pressure across multiple front-line sectors.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-assault-intensity-declines-but-remains-high-focus-on-pokrovsk-sector-monitoring-group-reports/	2025-01-29T06:02:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1239919502.jpeg
Russian army recruitment centres in Moscow see five-fold drop in applicants, media reports	The number of Russians signing contracts at Moscow recruitment centres to fight in the war against Ukraine has fallen five-fold since its peak in late summer of last year, the independent Russian outlet Verstka reported on Jan. 29. The daily number of volunteers signing-up reached a high following Ukraine&#x2019;s Kursk offensive and the introduction of a one-time payment of 1.9 million rubles ($19,200) shortly before that. Since then, daily applicants number around 40, a fivefold decrease, Verstka reported, citing a source in the Moscow mayor&apos;s office. &quot;In August, we could barely cope. People came en masse, 200-250 people a day,&quot; the source said, adding: &quot;Both money and the entry of the Ukrainian Armed Forces into the Kursk region played a role. Now interest has fallen to minimal levels.&quot; Verstka also reports that the composition of applicants has changed, and half of those signing up currently are foreigners of African, Asian and Chinese origin looking to make extra money, or Russians under investigation in criminal cases. Russia is currently suffering around 1500-1750 casualties daily on the battlefield, including dead, wounded and captured, as it continues to make grinding advances in eastern Ukraine. Russia quickly advanced in Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk Oblast in late 2024, making operationally significant gains near Toretsk, Chasiv Yar, and Kupiansk, as well as on its own soil in Kursk Oblast. However, a major breakthrough seems unlikely by Russia given its stretched resources, NATO&apos;s Supreme Allied Commander said earlier this month.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-army-recruitment-centres-in-moscow-see-five-fold-drop-in-applicants-media-reports/	2025-01-29T05:47:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1247352766.jpg
Syria demands Russian compensation for 'past mistakes' in first talks since Assad's fall	Syria&apos;s new government pressed Russia for compensation and the correction of &quot;past mistakes&quot; during its first talks with a Kremlin delegation on Jan. 28, following the ouster of Russian-backed dictator Bashar al-Assad in December. &quot;The dialogue highlighted Russia&#x2019;s role in rebuilding trust with the Syrian people through compensation, reconstruction, and recovery,&quot; a Syrian statement on the talks said. Russia deployed troops to Syria in 2015 to support the Assad regime&apos;s brutal crackdown against anti-government forces. With Moscow&apos;s support, Assad&apos;s regime was free to imprison, torture, and murder hundreds of thousands of Syrians. Assad would later flee to Moscow where he now resides. Russia&apos;s delegation, which included Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and President Vladimir Putin&apos;s special envoy for Syria, Alexander Lavrentyev, met with Syria&apos;s de facto leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa.

Following Assad&apos;s ouster and flight to Russia, Moscow began withdrawing military assets, leaving the future of its bases in Tartus and Khmeimim uncertain. Satellite images revealed that a &quot;large amount&quot; of Russian military equipment disappeared from Tartus after the cargo ship Sparta II&apos;s departure, investigative journalist Mark Krutov said on Jan. 27.

Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi noted that Kyiv and Damascus share similar views on the issue, though details were not disclosed.	https://kyivindependent.com/syria-seeks-russian-compensation-for-past-mistakes-in-first-talks-since-assads-fall/	2025-01-29T04:20:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2187214812.jpg
Slavoj Zizek: ‘Putin represents the worst of a longstanding trend in Russian history’	In times of war, the fundamental questions of survival, morality, and identity not only dominate the discourse but also expose the fissures in global political ideologies. Amid the clamor of media narratives and entrenched partisan frameworks, a few voices manage to rise above the fray, offering incisive critiques and grappling with the uncomfortable truths that others often evade. Slavoj Zizek, the Slovenian philosopher known for his eclectic blend of psychoanalysis, Marxism, and cultural critique, continues to challenge conventional thinking on global politics, war, and the intricate dilemmas of leftist ideology. In an interview with the Kyiv Independent, Zizek addressed the role of humor in wartime, the roots of the long-standing romanticization of Russia in the West, and the failure of the left in the face of Ukraine&#x2019;s fight for survival. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. The Kyiv Independent: The persistent threat of a Russian nuclear strike over the past three years has sharpened Ukrainians&apos; dark humor, which often thrives in wartime. Why do you think it still shocks outside observers that people can (and need to) laugh in the face of death? Slavoj Zizek: I&#x2019;m suspicious of those who respond to the suffering of others with tears and dramatic public displays of sympathy. In my experience, the people who behave this way are usually not the ones who have truly suffered. It&#x2019;s an emotional performance, detached from the reality of what it means to endure pain. I often refer to a story about an Australian aborigine visited by Western observers with benevolent intentions. The aborigine says to them: &#x201C;If you&#x2019;ve come here to sympathize with our suffering and express compassion, go home. But if you&#x2019;ve come here to fight alongside us, then stay.&#x201D; I think this captures that total hypocrisy perfectly, the same kind we see on a larger scale toward the people of Ukraine, Gaza, and elsewhere today. When suffering is unbearable, you can&#x2019;t indulge too deeply in mourning because you&#x2019;re still in the midst of it. You either withdraw entirely, becoming some sort of weirdo, or you cope through humor. Even in Auschwitz, Jews made jokes about their predicament &#x2014; it was their way of managing the horror. Only later, in the 1950s, did they begin to gain some emotional distance from it all and the serious mourning and reflection on those tragedies began. The same thing happened during the Yugoslav Wars, particularly after the massacre in Srebrenica. In the face of such trauma, people developed jokes to cope. Humor was the only way to survive emotionally. I don&#x2019;t see anything disrespectful about it. Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek speaks at the opening of Phil.Cologne in Cologne, Germany, on June 6, 2023. (Rolf Vennenbernd/picture alliance via Getty Images)Have you read Primo Levi&#x2019;s classic Holocaust memoir, &#x201C;If This Is a Man?&#x201D; He describes moments that, despite the horror, are almost comical. For example, during the monthly selection where prisoners had to run past an SS officer who would quickly decide if they were still healthy enough to work or should be sent to the gas chambers, prisoners would prepare themselves for that fleeting moment of judgment. They&#x2019;d pinch their lips, cheeks, or stomachs to appear redder and healthier. These are absurdly tragic yet darkly comic scenes. There are moments that go beyond horror, even beyond heroism. In the concentration camps &#x2014; or the Stalinist gulags, for that matter &#x2014; the situation was so desperate that there was no room for the traditional image of heroism. You couldn&#x2019;t play the role of the brave martyr, standing defiantly and saying, &#x201C;Go ahead, shoot me, I&#x2019;ll never betray my principles.&#x201D; The conditions were simply too extreme for that. Nobody should be ashamed of finding humor or other ways to cope with war. It&#x2019;s not a betrayal of the situation &#x2014; it can actually give you the strength to fight better. The Kyiv Independent: Yes &#x2014; a sort of clarity emerges when you fully understand the reality that you face. Slavoj Zizek: Did you see the documentary &#x201C;Real&#x201D; by Oleh Sentsov? It&#x2019;s one of the best works of cinema I&#x2019;ve ever seen. Sentsov discovered while on leave (from the military) that his helmet-mounted camera had captured footage from a battle, and he used that footage to create the film. What I love about &#x201C;Real&#x201D; is how it avoids two common traps when portraying war. On the one hand, it steers clear of false pacifism &#x2014; the simplistic notion that war is just meaningless violence and killing. On the other hand, it also avoids romanticizing heroism. It doesn&#x2019;t indulge in the idea that war is noble. The title is not a reference to &quot;real&quot; horror but rather the code name for a position (to which Sentsov is trying to organize an evacuation of his unit during the attack) &#x2014; there are code names of football clubs like Real Madrid, Barcelona, and so on. Sentsov&#x2019;s film captures the absolute absurdity of war. It highlights something crucial: true heroism isn&#x2019;t about escaping into the fantasy of war as something glamorous or honorable. It&#x2019;s about confronting the senseless, meaningless violence of war while still recognizing the necessity to fight. What&#x2019;s even more remarkable is that after completing the film, if I understand correctly, Sentsov himself returned to the front lines. That, to me, is real heroism. The Kyiv Independent: Despite the horrors of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, we see that a fascination with all things Russian continues in Western culture. It seems the world still hasn&#x2019;t moved past Voltaire&#x2019;s depictions of the Russian Empire struggling to emerge from barbarity and embrace the Enlightenment. They are enticed by it. What do you think accounts for this long-standing romanticization? Slavoj Zizek: There has always been this question of whether Russia can truly be democratic. However, we shouldn&#x2019;t oversimplify it. Many figures considered Russian heroes &#x2014; from Ivan the Terrible to Peter the Great and Catherine the Great &#x2014; saw themselves as authoritarian Western modernizers. Even Stalin is part of this tradition. When Stalin was young, someone asked him how he would define a Bolshevik. His response was: &quot;A combination of Russian messianic dedication and American pragmatism.&quot; This reveals an interesting dynamic &#x2014; Bolsheviks were always secretly enamored with the energy and dynamism of the American model. Their challenge was figuring out how to merge that with their ideological vision.

(Contributor/Getty Images)That&#x2019;s why I wouldn&#x2019;t dismiss Putin as a relic of some old Russian tradition. No, Putin represents the worst of a longstanding trend in Russian history, one that dates back to figures like Ivan the Terrible and Peter I &#x2014; authoritarian modernizers who sought to bring Russia into modernity but on their own terms, using brutal, centralized control. This authoritarian modernization has a strong historical precedent, even extending into Far Eastern traditions. For example, in the early 20th century, Pan-Asianism emerged in countries like China and Japan. They faced a similar dilemma: how to catch up with the West in terms of technology and economics without losing their cultural identity to Western liberalism. Their solution? Fascism. Look not just at Alexander Dugin but at the whole crowd of ideologists orbiting Putin. Their core idea &#x2014; it&#x2019;s pure horror &#x2014; is this notion of Eurasia, this mystical Euro-Asian identity. It&#x2019;s such a stupid, vulgar, fascist kind of reasoning. On the one hand, you get this primitive Orientalism: embracing the idea that the East is passive, backward, stupid. On the other hand, you have this caricature of Western liberalism, a kind of decadent self-destruction through excessive individualism. Of course, they position Russia as the magical &#x201C;right balance&#x201D; &#x2014; the supposed perfect synthesis of an individual in a harmonious, free society. The Kyiv Independent: Some on the Left have questioned your support for Ukraine. Why do you think they struggle to see this war as a quintessential example of a smaller nation resisting a larger, colonial power? Slavoj Zizek: It&#x2019;s incredible to me how many pseudo-leftists are drawn to this strange fascination with Russia. Even though they admit that Putin is horrible, they still cling to the idea that Russia, somehow being less affected by Western consumerism, somehow preserves more &#x201C;authentic&#x201D; human relationships. For example, an idiot once told me that while the West is all about promiscuity and sexual freedoms, in Russia, &#x201C;true love&#x201D; is still possible. This romanticized notion of Russia is often combined with another leftist dogma: that NATO is the ultimate evil. According to this view, anyone in conflict with NATO must have something good or virtuous about them. By this logic, Ukraine is disqualified from support because it&#x2019;s seen as merely fighting a &#x201C;proxy war&#x201D; on behalf of NATO. It worries me that they treat Ukrainians as some kind of idiots &#x2014; they falsify the choice that Ukrainians face. This oversimplification completely ignores reality. For Ukrainians, the choice isn&#x2019;t between peace and war &#x2014; it&#x2019;s between resisting or disappearing as a nation. The Russians have made that abundantly clear. When people say, &quot;We should stop supporting Ukraine and push for negotiations with Russia,&quot; I respond, &quot;Maybe &#x2014; but that decision should ultimately be up to the Ukrainians.&quot; However, are they aware that Ukraine&apos;s current strength to negotiate, if it exists, is entirely due to its resistance? Without Western support, Ukraine would never have reached a position where negotiations are even possible. This is absolutely clear. The Kyiv Independent: We have seen efforts, particularly from the right, including part of U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s circle, to discredit Zelensky &#x2014; falsely portraying him as corrupt, overly reliant on foreign aid, and mocking his media savvy rather than recognizing it as a strength. This is in addition to the left pushing the idea that Ukraine is engaged in a &#x201C;proxy war.&#x201D; What do these shifts in global public opinion reveal about the dynamics of political power, media manipulation, and how they shape public perception in the face of a war of total annihilation? Slavoj Zizek: The problem is that neither side listens to counterarguments. For example, here in Slovenia, when I pointed out that treating Ukraine&#x2019;s defense as a proxy war for NATO essentially insults Ukrainians, people don&#x2019;t seem to grasp it. Ukrainians are being portrayed as if they could choose peace but instead decide to engage in a war that displaces a quarter of their population, just for the sake of a proxy war. But in reality, it&#x2019;s a matter of their survival. They don&#x2019;t listen to that. They claim peace is the most important value, but here&#x2019;s the irony: in my country, the left-wing who claim this are also supporting the memory of partisans from Yugoslavia, particularly in Slovenia, who fought against German occupation. The partisans were doing something very similar, and arguably more extreme, than what Ukrainians are doing now. They resisted Germany, often executing hostages and engaging in violent acts. Meanwhile, the ideology of the right-wingers who collaborated with the Germans was that resistance couldn&#x2019;t be afforded because it would threaten the Slovenian nation. So here&#x2019;s the paradox: the same people who defend resistance now &#x2014; when Slovenia was much more vulnerable than Ukraine, without NATO support &#x2014; are now advocating for peace, ignoring the complexities of the situation.

(Gavriil Grigorov/Pool/AFP via Getty Images)They claim Ukraine is crazy, accusing it of trying to push the West into using nuclear weapons. But the real debate in the West is that no one is talking about the first use of nuclear arms &#x2014; it&#x2019;s Russia that&#x2019;s constantly making these threats. Every six months, Putin and his allies, especially the madman (Russian Security Council Deputy Chair) Dmitry Medvedev, keep escalating the rhetoric. Medvedev is just a tool for Putin &#x2014; he says the more extreme things while Putin knows how to manipulate the situation. What&#x2019;s crazy is that when Russia threatens the first use of nuclear weapons, it&#x2019;s just accepted as a fact. But when Ukraine just wants to defend itself (by striking targets in Russian territory), it&#x2019;s labeled as a madman trying to provoke Russia. I find that humiliating. I once made this comparison: it&#x2019;s like a woman, Ukraine in this case, being brutally raped. In despair, she tries to do something &#x2014; what would you do if you were in that situation? I can only imagine as a man, maybe you would scratch, try to hit his eyes, or do whatever you could to survive. And then the West&#x2019;s response would be to say to this woman, &quot;It&#x2019;s too painful, don&#x2019;t provoke him.&quot; This fundamental disorientation is horrifying to me. I think it will contribute to the end of the left as we know it. Some form of the left will survive, but right now, in places like Germany and the U.K., the real opposition is between moderately conservative centrists &#x2014; like the U.K.&#x2019;s Labour Party, which is now largely moderate &#x2014; and the extreme conservatives. It&#x2019;s the same with the Democrats: they&#x2019;re the moderately conservative ones against Trump. Isn&#x2019;t it a sad world when the only choices are between moderate conservatives pretending to be liberals, and extreme figures like Trump feeding off ordinary people&apos;s rage? I&#x2019;m a pessimist, I must admit it. Hi, this is Kate Tsurkan, thanks for reading this interview.

Trump must call Putin’s bluff on Ukraine talks	Russian President Vladimir Putin is starting 2025 with a bang. In a nod to U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s desire for a settlement in Ukraine, the Kremlin has announced its readiness for negotiations &#x201C;without preconditions.&#x201D; However, the devil is in the details. For Russia, &#x201C;without preconditions&#x201D; translates to cutting off Ukraine from any meaningful security guarantees and downgrading NATO&#x2019;s ability to deter and defend member states in Eastern Europe. This outcome, if realized, would be disastrous for U.S. interests and would set the stage for renewed and more widespread warfare in the not-too-distant future. It doesn&#x2019;t have to be this way. While 2025 will undoubtedly pose serious challenges for Ukrainian forces, the next 12 months will be no cakewalk for Moscow either. Russia&#x2019;s wartime economy is under severe strain: inflation, crippling labor shortages, and a wave of newly announced sanctions targeting its oil exports spell significant trouble in the year ahead. In his annual staged &#x201C;Direct Line&#x201D; call-in show last month, Putin admitted, &#x201C;Of course, inflation is such an alarming signal.&#x201D; No doubt the czar is alarmed &#x2014; he knows rampant inflation played no small role in the demise of Nicholas II. Signs of a fragile Russian economy are everywhere, and Russian elites are growing increasingly discontented. Take Russia&#x2019;s civilian aviation sector, which has been hard hit by sanctions. An increasing number of Western aircraft have been grounded because Russia lacks the parts and expertise to maintain them. Or consider Russian gas giant Gazprom, which reported this month that it is weighing 40% cuts to its headquarters staff. Putin is all in on the war against Ukraine. Having sacrificed a limited civilian economy to power a genocidal war, it is unclear whether Moscow could transition back from war production even if it wanted to. Furthermore, Russia cannot replace its battlefield equipment losses, even accounting for the use of dwindling Soviet-era stockpiles. This shortfall is especially acute for components such as artillery and tank barrels, which require advanced equipment Russia has limited access to. Ukrainian long-range strikes are also taking a heavy toll on Russia&#x2019;s manufacturing capacity. Last week, Ukraine, using a mix of drones and long-range missiles, launched its largest barrage yet against factories and bases inside Russia.

(Roman Pilipey / AFP via Getty Images)Replacing soldiers is another fraught proposition. While Ukraine&#x2019;s manpower shortage is on the mind of the new administration, Russia faces manpower issues of its own. Recently, Ukraine&#x2019;s General Staff reported that Russia has lost over 800,000 troops since the second invasion began. That staggering number would fill the Superdome &#x2014; host to the upcoming Super Bowl &#x2014; 10 times over. To pay this butcher&#x2019;s bill, the Kremlin has turned to North Korean troops and consistently ramped up sign-on bonuses and casualty payouts. Putin will do nearly anything to avoid a new round of mobilization, yet these tactics have only worsened Russia&#x2019;s economic woes, accelerated demographic decline, and complicated relations with Beijing. Making matters worse, Putin&#x2019;s war of choice against Ukraine has crippled his ability and willingness to intervene in Syria to save former Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. Finding his grip on power unraveling after nearly a decade of Russian support, Assad has been left stranded by Putin. Reports suggest Assad has been seeking permission to flee to the UAE rather than live out his days under Putin&#x2019;s thumb in Russia. The fall of Assad has challenged Russian credibility and undermined, at least temporarily, Russia&#x2019;s ability to project power in the Middle East and Africa. Russia appears to have lost access to the crucial Tartus naval base.. contract for managing the port with Russian engineering construction company Stroytransgaz has been canceled, and a broader withdrawal of Russian vehicles and cargo has this week been underway Russia will resettle some of the Syrian based assets in Libya, but will be unable to fully cover the strategic loss. Despite these setbacks, Putin is preparing to enter peace talks with the new administration with maximalist goals. By supporting Ukraine, the Trump team can make Putin&#x2019;s increasingly difficult choices even more painful. When all is said and done, Russia in 2025 may be exposed as a Potemkin village. With sustained U.S. and Western support, Ukraine can outlast Russia and secure a better outcome after years of combat.

EU to propose phased ban on Russian aluminium in new sanctions package, Bloomberg reports	In its latest round of sanctions, the European Union (EU) is proposing to introduce a phased ban of Russian aluminium, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 28 citing unnamed sources. The bloc, which covers 8% of its annual aluminium needs by Russian imports, plans to allow for the import of 275,000 metric tons of aluminium under a quota system for one more year before banning it entirely, the outlet reported. The sanctions will also cut off more Russian banks from the SWIFT banking system, and target an additional 70 vessels suspected to be part of Russia&#x2019;s &quot;shadow-fleet.&quot; Imposing or continuing sanctions requires a unanimous decision by the bloc&#x2019;s member states. The European Union foreign ministers approved the extension of current sanctions against Russia for another six months on Jan. 27, after bumpy negotiations with Hungary&#x2019;s Prime Minister Viktor Orban who has threatened to veto the extension until Ukraine resumes the transit of Russian gas through its territory. Hungary eventually voted for the renewal of the sanctions package after received the &quot;requested guarantees&quot; on energy security, its foreign minister said. Ukraine terminated Russian natural gas transit through its territory on Jan. 1. Kyiv has repeatedly warned that it would not extend the agreement when it expires at the end of 2024 because it did not want to finance Russia&apos;s war. The end of transit led to a spat between Kyiv on one side and Hungary and Slovakia on the other, with the two latter countries complaining the decision endangers their energy security. Ukraine continues to transit Russian oil, though a bill on banning the transit has been registered in the parliament. The EU has imposed 15 sanctions packages against Russia, which include restrictions on individuals and legal entities. The limitations also targeted Russia&#x2019;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of oil tankers and froze Russian assets, among other moves.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-to-propose-phased-ban-on-russian-aluminium-in-new-sanctions-package-bloomberg-reports/	2025-01-29T03:17:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-139580401.jpg
Australian POW feared executed by Russia is alive, Penny Wong says	An Australian volunteer soldier fighting for Ukraine who was reported to have been executed by Russian forces after being taken prisoner is alive, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on Jan. 29. &quot;The Australian government has received confirmation from Russia that Oscar Jenkins is alive and in custody,&quot; she said in comments reported by The Guardian. Jenkins is serving in the 402nd Separate Rifle Battalion, which is part of Ukraine&apos;s 66th Separate Mechanized Brigade, the Ukrainian investigative journalism outlet Slidstvo.Info reported on Jan. 17. He went missing on Dec. 16 in 2024 while being on a combat mission near the village of Mykolaivka in Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces Command told the outlet. In a video that emerged on Russian Telegram channels in late December, Jenkins is seen in military fatigues, interrogated by Russian captors. The man behind the camera asks the captive about his name and background and whether he wants to live while beating him over the head. Unverified reports began circulating in mid-January that the soldier was executed by his Russian captors, prompting Australian officials to make urgent inquiries to Russia about his whereabouts. &quot;We still hold serious concerns for Mr Jenkins as a prisoner of war,&quot; Wong said, adding: &quot;We have made clear to Russia in Canberra and in Moscow that Mr Jenkins is a prisoner of war and Russia is obligated to treat him in accordance with international humanitarian law, including humane treatment.&quot; Russia has been repeatedly accused of summarily executing Ukrainian POWs throughout the war. The Geneva Conventions mandate all warring parties to treat POW with respect and dignity, while executing POWs is considered a gross violation of international law and a war crime. Unlike most other foreigners volunteering to join Ukraine&apos;s resistance against Russia, Jenkins has had no military experience. The Australian media described the man as &quot;much loved&quot; by his community in Australia, a talented cricket and football player who studied biomedical sciences before working as a lecturer in China. He is believed to have traveled to Ukraine in 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/australian-pow-feared-executed-by-russia-is-alive-penny-wong-says/	2025-01-29T02:22:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Oscar-Jenkins.png
Rubio issues humanitarian waiver for Trump's foreign aid freeze, WP reports	U.S. State Secretary Marco Rubio has backtracked on a near-total freeze of U.S. foreign aid, issuing a waiver for &quot;life-saving humanitarian assistance,&quot; the Washington Post (WP) reported on. Jan 28 citing memos sent to aid organizations. U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his inauguration day suspending foreign aid programs for 90 days so they can be reviewed to ensure they align with &quot;American interests&quot; and &quot;American values.&quot; In Ukraine, the organizations affected provide a huge range of humanitarian services, including counseling, organizing cultural events, and providing basic services, often to some of the most vulnerable segments of society. In the memo seen by WP, Rubio issues a waiver for work he defined as &quot;core life saving medicine, medical services, food, shelter, and subsistence assistance, as well as supplies and reasonable administrative costs as necessary to deliver such assistance.&quot; Those not covered by the waiver include &quot;abortions, family planning conferences&#x2026; transgender surgeries, or other non-life saving assistance.&quot; &quot;Implementers of existing life saving humanitarian assistance programs should continue or resume work if they have stopped,&quot; the memo added. WP reported that many programs funded by the U.S.&apos;s roughly $60 billion foreign aid budget were left confused as to whether or not they qualified for the waiver. Elsewhere, President Volodymyr Zelensky has ordered a report on U.S.-funded projects in Ukraine affected the freeze on foreign assistance, he said during his evening address on Jan. 28. &quot;I instructed government officials to provide a report on those American support programmes that are currently suspended,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;We can provide part of this funding through our state finances, and we will discuss some of them with Europeans and Americans,&quot; he added, saying that programs concerning Ukrainian children, veterans and protecting infrastructure would be prioritized.	https://kyivindependent.com/rubio-issues-humanitarian-waiver-for-trumps-foreign-aid-freeze-wp-reports/	2025-01-29T01:20:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194552772.jpg
Zelensky orders report on Ukrainian programmes affected by Trump's foreign aid freeze	President Volodymyr Zelensky has ordered a report on U.S.-funded projects in Ukraine affected by President Donald Trump&apos;s freeze on foreign assistance, he said during his evening address on Jan. 28. U.S. President Donald Trump suspended all U.S. foreign aid programs for 90 days in an executive order signed on his day of inauguration, Jan. 20, putting the existence of many programs in Ukraine in limbo. &quot;I instructed government officials to provide a report on those American support programmes that are currently suspended,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;We can provide part of this funding through our state finances, and we will discuss some of them with Europeans and Americans,&quot;he added, saying that programs concerning Ukrainian children, veterans and protecting infrastructure would be prioritized. One of Trump&apos;s first actions upon entering the White House was to sign an executive order freezing foreign development assistance for 90 days to conduct a review and ensure it aligns with the new administration&apos;s policies. In Ukraine, the organizations affected provide a huge range of humanitarian services, including counseling, organizing cultural events, and providing basic services, often to some of the most vulnerable segments of society. The freeze does not apply to military assistance for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-orders-report-on-ukrainian-programmes-affected-by-trumps-foreign-aid-freeze/	2025-01-29T00:50:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2195371666.jpg
Russian state delegation arrives in Syria, first since fall of Assad	Russian officials arrived in Damascus, Syria on Jan.28, the first such delegation to visit the country since its Kremlin-backed dictator Bashar al-Assad was ousted from power in December, AP reported, citing Russian state media. Assad was ousted from power following a lightning offensive by rebels, putting an end to a decade-long civil war. He took refuge in Moscow. The delegation includes Russian deputy foreign minister Mikhail Bogdanov, and the Russian president&#x2019;s special envoy for Syria, Alexander Lavrentyev. Russian state media cited by AP did not specify the purpose of the delegation&#x2019;s visit, but the new Syrian authorities&apos; semi-official newspaper, Al Watan, reported it will meet with the de-facto new leader of the country Ahmad al-Sharaa, and with the new foreign minister. After Assad was overthrown and fled to Russia, Moscow began withdrawing military and naval assets from Syria, and the future of its military bases such as the Tartus naval base and the Khmeimim air base remain unclear. Moscow deployed its troops to Syria in 2015, providing support to the Assad regime against multiple anti-government forces. Damascus had been supportive of the Kremlin during the ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A &quot;large amount&quot; of Russian military equipment vanished from the Syrian port of Tartus with the departure of the Russian cargo ship Sparta II, an investigative journalist at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Mark Krutov, said on Jan. 27, citing satellite images. Another Russian cargo ship called Sparta remained docked in the port after the two ships idled for weeks off the coast before being granted permission to dock, the BBC reported. The BBC added that there were probably two more Russian warships in the port, the Ivan Gren and the Aleksandr Otrakovsky. This assessment was supported by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-state-delegation-arrives-in-syria-first-since-fall-of-assad/	2025-01-28T23:38:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2195599470.jpg
4 out of 4' — Russian Lukoil oil refinery struck by multiple Ukrainian drones, military intelligence source claims	A Lukoil oil refinery in the Russian oblast of Nizhny Novgorod was struck by multiple Ukrainian drones in the early hours of Jan. 29, a military intelligence (HUR) source told the Kyiv Independent. Drone strikes were reported by local officials across several Russian regions overnight, including the Nizhny Novgorod, Smolensk, Tver, and Bryansk oblasts, causing fires and prompting air defense responses. According to the HUR source, the Lukoil oil depot in the city of Kstovo was targeted by four drones, all of which struck their target and caused &quot;significant damage.&quot; They added the refinery &quot;supports the activities of the Russian occupation forces&quot; and was &quot;attacked at around midnight local time.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims, but overnight local Telegram channels reported that drones targeted the Lukoil Nizhegorodnefteorgsintez oil refinery, resulting in a large fire. Video footage circulating online showed flames at the facility, which local monitoring channels identified as the likely target of the attack. Governor Gleb Nikitin confirmed that air defense systems had shot down multiple drones, and fragments from the intercepted UAVs fell on the industrial site. No injuries were reported. In the Smolensk region, Governor Vasily Anokhin reported a &quot;massive drone attack&quot; on civilian infrastructure. One drone was intercepted while attempting to strike a nuclear energy facility. Nearby, air defenses also destroyed several drones around the town of Andreapol, home to approximately 8,000 people, in the Tver region, according to the local governor. The Russian Ministry of Defense also announced that air defense systems had shot down 26 drones in the Bryansk region. Bryansk lies west of embattled Kursk Oblast, north of Ukraine&apos;s Chernihiv and Sumy oblasts, and east of the Belarusian border.	https://kyivindependent.com/4-out-of-4-russian-lukoil-oil-refinery-struck-by-multiple-ukrainian-drones-military-intelligence-source-claims/	2025-01-28T22:55:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-136009136.jpg

Kallas, Rubio discuss Ukraine in first official phone call	EU Chief Diplomat Kaja Kallas spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Jan. 28 in their first official phone conversation since the Trump administration took office. &quot;Good call with Sec. Rubio,&#x201D; Kallas wrote on X. &#x201C;We discussed global issues where the EU and U.S. have the same interests, including Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine, Iran&#x2019;s malign influence, and challenges posed by China.&quot; She also stressed that the EU and the U.S. &#x201C;are always stronger together,&quot; and said that she was eager to meet with Rubio soon to continue discussions. U.S. President Donald Trump and his team have expressed skepticism about the ongoing financial U.S. support for Ukraine. Notably, Rubio announced a 90-day pause on Jan. 24 regarding all U.S. foreign aid. Meanwhile, Kallas said on Jan. 9 that the EU is prepared to take a leading role in supporting Ukraine if U.S. backing wanes. &quot;If the United States is not ready for it, the European Union is ready to take the lead,&quot; Kallas said.	https://kyivindependent.com/kallas-rubio-discuss-ukraine-in-first-official-phone-call/	2025-01-28T22:01:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-643099758.jpg
2 killed in Mykolaiv amid Russian missile attack	Two people were killed in the city of Mykolaiv amid a Russian missile strike, regional governor Vitalii Kim reported on Jan. 28. &quot;Sadly, two women were killed as a result of the Russian missile strike on Mykolaiv,&#x201D; Kim said on Telegram. &#x201C;They were employees of the attacked private enterprise.&quot; The women were aged 54 and 56, according to the State Emergency Service. They also reported that it was a food industry facility in the regional center that was hit, and that the building was partially destroyed. Mykolaiv Oblast and other southern regions regularly suffer Russian attacks. The city of Mykolaiv lies roughly 60 kilometers (37 miles) northwest of the front line in Kherson Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/2-killed-in-mykolaiv-amid-russian-missile-strike/	2025-01-28T20:26:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/myk.jpg
US judge temporarily halts Trump's federal aid freeze, NYT reports	A federal judge temporarily halted the Trump administration&#x2019;s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memo that sought to freeze up to $3 billion in funding for various U.S. federal aid programs, the New York Times (NYT) reported on Jan. 28. U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan, appointed by President Biden, issued an administrative stay, delaying the funding freeze until Monday. The decision came after a virtual court hearing in which AliKhan listened to arguments from the Department of Justice and multiple plaintiffs. One lawsuit was filed by activist group Democracy Forward, and a separate case was filed by attorneys general from 22 states and D.C. Trump&#x2019;s administration has now temporarily halted not only international but also federal aid, including the issuance of new grants and loans. The freeze will affect programs in the U.S., including preschools, medical research facilities, low-income food initiatives, housing assistance, and disaster relief organizations. Previously on Jan. 24, as one of Trump&#x2019;s first orders since assuming office, the U.S. State Department suspended almost all foreign aid, including non-military assistance to Ukraine. The step threw Ukrainian NGOs, many reliant on U.S. support, into disarray, with some voicing concerns about their ability to survive the aid freeze. Ukraine currently tops the recipient list of U.S. development assistance as it continues to face Russia&#x2019;s war, official data shows. The White House and State Department stated that the pause, in both domestic and international aid, is necessary to review programs and ensure their funding aligns with the &#x201C;president&apos;s priorities.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-judge-temporarily-halts-trumps-federal-aid-freeze-nyt-reports/	2025-01-28T18:51:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194362860-1.jpg
Drone strikes target multiple Russian regions, hit oil refinery in Nizhny Novgorod	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Ukraine launched waves of drone attacks targeting oil and power facilities in western parts of Russia overnight on Jan. 29, according to local officials. Drone strikes were reported across several Russian regions, including the Nizhny Novgorod, Smolensk, Tver, and Bryansk regions, causing fires and prompting air defense responses. The Kyiv Independent can&apos;t immediately verify the reports. While there were no reported casualties, an oil refinery in the city of Kstovo, Nizhny Novgorod, sustained significant damage.

Mayor in Ukraine's Lviv Oblast fined for disrupting mobilization activities	Taras Kuchma, Drohobych Mayor in Lviv Oblast, was fined for disrupting mobilization activities, Ukrainian media outlet Zaxid.net reported on Jan. 28. Ukraine updated its legislation in the spring of 2024, assigning several mobilization responsibilities to local governments. According to the new legislation, the local authorities had to ensure the organization of conscription, summoning of people liable for military service and reservists to the enlistment offices, and mobilization training, among other functions. Kuchma declared that he would appeal the decision and did not plan to pay the fine, the media outlet said. According to Kuchma, city mayors do not have the authority to bring people to the enlistment offices. &quot;There is a decree that obliges us to carry out mobilization tasks without giving us the authority. How can a city mayor deliver people to the enlistment office for conscription?&quot; he claimed. The 59-year-old official was first invited to the local enlistment office to be fined. As he did not show up, the enlistment office management sent a letter to the police to bring him forcibly. Afterward, the mayor came to the enlistment office on his own. The mayor was supposed to arrive at the enlistment office on Jan. 22 but did not due to official events scheduled for that day in the city, as he later told reporters. &quot;We sent a letter (to the enlistment office), wrote that we would not come, and if you have any questions, write to us, and we will answer. The response of the head of the enlistment office was that a letter was sent to the police to bring the mayor in forcibly,&quot; Kuchma said. The mayors of Truskavets, Skhidnytsia, Boryslav, and Medenychi in Lviv Oblast were also fined for failing to fulfill the mobilization task and disrupting mobilization activities, according to Zaxid.net. The fine for this violation is nearly Hr 36,000 ($856). The Ukrainian Cities&apos; Association, which unites local governments and protects their interests, issued an open appeal to President Volodymyr Zelensky in late January about pressure on local authorities in small communities. Ukraine has struggled with manpower issues throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. An updated mobilization law passed in April 2024 aimed to address these difficulties, simplifying the process for identifying eligible conscripts and introducing penalties for draft dodgers. Mobilization slowed last autumn despite the legislative reforms, leaving depleted front-line units to face Russia&apos;s eastern advance.	https://kyivindependent.com/mayor-in-ukraines-lviv-oblast-fined-for-disrupting-mobilization-activities-he-objects/	2025-01-28T15:46:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/army-1.jpg
China urges Russia, US to cut nuclear arsenals before joining disarmament talks	China urged the United States and Russia on Jan. 28 to &quot;further reduce&quot; their nuclear stockpiles as a necessary step before Beijing would consider joining potential disarmament talks proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. In a video message to the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, Trump expressed his desire for &quot;denuclearisation&quot; and reiterated his call for trilateral discussions involving the U.S., Russia, and China. Following Trump&#x2019;s address, Russia responded by expressing its willingness to resume bilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations with the U.S. &quot;as soon as possible,&quot; adding that &quot;the ball is in the Americans&apos; court.&quot; Together, the U.S. and Russia hold nearly 90 percent of the world&#x2019;s nuclear weapons. However, relations between the two nations deteriorated sharply, leading Moscow to withdraw from the last remaining arms control agreement with Washington in 2023. In a statement to AFP, China&#x2019;s foreign ministry emphasized that &quot;the two nuclear powers with the largest nuclear arsenals should conscientiously fulfill their special... responsibilities for nuclear disarmament.&quot; The ministry added that they &quot;must further substantially reduce their nuclear arsenals, so as to create the necessary conditions for other nuclear-weapon states to join the disarmament process.&quot; Although Beijing claims to support disarmament in principle, it has consistently declined U.S. invitations to join disarmament talks with Russia. According to estimates from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in 2024, the United States possesses 3,708 nuclear warheads, while Russia has 4,380, excluding retired weapons. China has 500 warheads, 90 more than it had in 2023. France and the United Kingdom follow with 290 and 225 warheads, respectively. China has reiterated that its nuclear arsenal is solely for &quot;self-defense&quot; and maintains its nuclear forces &quot;at the minimum level required for national security.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/china-urges-russia-us-to-cut-nuclear-arsenals-before-joining-disarmament-talks/	2025-01-28T15:40:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1826910292--1-.jpg
US transfers 90 Patriot missiles from Israel to Ukraine, Axios reports	The United States has transferred around 90 Patriot air defense interceptors from storage in Israel to Poland for delivery to Ukraine, sources familiar with the operation told Axios. The transfer comes as part of efforts by the Pentagon to bolster Ukraine&#x2019;s air defense capabilities against Russian attacks on critical infrastructure. This marks the most significant delivery of weapons involving Israel to Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion nearly three years ago. The Patriot air defense system was officially decommissioned by the Israeli Air Force in April 2023, over three decades after it was first provided to Israel during the Gulf War. With Israel now relying on its own advanced air defense technologies, such as the Iron Dome, the Patriot system had been relegated to training or storage. Following its retirement, Ukrainian officials approached both the U.S. and Israel with a proposal to return the missiles to the U.S. for refurbishment and subsequent delivery to Ukraine, Axios reports. Despite the plan, Israel initially delayed its decision due to concerns that Russia might retaliate by supplying advanced weaponry to Iran. According to a Ukrainian official, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu refused to engage in discussions about the proposal for weeks. However, Netanyahu reportedly approved the transfer in late September. The Ukrainian official alleged that Netanyahu sought a concession from President Volodymyr Zelensky regarding an annual pilgrimage of ultra-Orthodox Israelis to Uman, Ukraine, before agreeing to the Patriot deal. Netanyahu&#x2019;s office has denied any connection between the two issues. In preparation for the transfer, U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo planes recently transported the interceptors from an air base in southern Israel to Rzesz&#xF3;w, Poland, a key logistics hub for military aid to Ukraine. Along with the interceptors, additional equipment, such as radars, will be sent to the U.S. for refurbishment before final delivery to Ukraine. The interceptors are compatible with the Patriot batteries already operational in Ukraine. An Israeli official said that Russia was informed in advance of the transfer, emphasizing that Israel was merely returning the Patriots to the U.S. rather than directly supplying weapons to Ukraine. The official compared the move to a prior U.S. decision to transfer artillery shells from storage in Israel to Ukraine. A spokesperson for Netanyahu&#x2019;s office confirmed that the Patriot system had been returned to the U.S. but said they had no knowledge of whether the interceptors had been sent to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-transfers-90-patriot-missiles-from-israel-to-ukraine-axios-reports/	2025-01-28T14:57:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/photo_2024-06-11_21-19-40.jpg
Trump’s foreign aid freeze stranded independent media in Ukraine. Here's how you can help	It probably made sense on paper. In his first week in office, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a 90&#x2013;day freeze on U.S. foreign aid to review whether the distribution aligned with his foreign policy. I can see how Trump supporters and his team might have considered it a reasonable move: A new president takes office with policies obviously different from his predecessor&#x2019;s, and he wants to look around. Now here&#x2019;s what it means in practice. Ukraine was among the many countries receiving the aid distributed through the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID. Since the full-scale war began in 2022, the agency has disbursed $30 billion in Ukraine, funding projects ranging from democracy support and humanitarian relief to local community development and key reforms. This aid paid for bomb shelters in schools, modern hospital equipment, and materials for small farmers to support agriculture. It sponsored anti-disinformation campaigns and mental health programs. Wherever you went, you&#x2019;d find good, change-making projects bearing the USAID logo. If I were an American taxpayer, I&#x2019;d feel proud. Then, it all stopped &#x2014; overnight. A few days ago, after Trump&#x2019;s order, Ukrainian organizations receiving U.S. aid received letters telling them to &#x201C;immediately stop all activities&#x201D; and &#x201C;not incur any new costs.&#x201D; This effectively froze their operations, even halting the use of already disbursed funds sitting in their accounts. Everything came to a stop. One of the hard-hit sectors &#x2014; and the one I know best &#x2014; is independent media. For years, foreign government grants have been the lifeblood of Ukraine&#x2019;s independent media. This stems from a simple reality: Ukraine is a young democracy, and its independent media emerged during a time when technology disrupted traditional funding models. In wealthier economies, newspapers have faced a choice: gradually decline or adapt with digital subscriptions. Even then, it&#x2019;s an uphill battle &#x2014; while the New York Times has turned a profit, the Washington Post has not. In Ukraine, independent media never had the opportunity to develop and adapt. The market has been merciless, and independent outlets have faced stiff competition from oligarch-owned media &#x2014; lavishly funded but designed to serve their owners&#x2019; interests rather than the public good. And yet Ukraine can&apos;t afford to not have independent media. Watchdog journalism is essential for holding those in power accountable. It&#x2019;s a cornerstone of any democracy, whether in Ukraine or the United States. &#xA0; This is where foreign aid stepped in. For years, grants from foreign governments have sustained independent newsrooms in Ukraine, allowing them to provide their communities with accurate information in the age of propaganda and disinformation. This funding isn&#x2019;t used on extravagances. It covers journalists&#x2019; salaries &#x2014; modest to the point of being unthinkable by U.S. standards. The annual budget of a regional online newspaper can be less than $200,000, yet these outlets are often the lifeline of their communities and the only dependable source of local news. The U.S. Agency of International Development (USAID) flag flies in front of the agency&apos;s headquarters in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 15, 2014. (J. David Ake/Getty Images)Here in Kyiv, these grants have supported investigative journalism teams that exposed high-level corruption, dismantling schemes worth millions of dollars. I often hear that investigative journalism offers the highest return on investment &#x2014; and this is exactly what that means. It&#x2019;s understandable to be wary of foreign money funding Ukrainian journalism, but there&#x2019;s no hidden agenda behind it. It&#x2019;s not about controlling the media or pushing specific narratives &#x2014; that is more common for domestic actors. Organizations providing foreign grants don&#x2019;t tell the media what to write or order journalists to support or attack particular policies or figures. That&#x2019;s what local oligarchs do. Foreign funding empowers journalists in markets like Ukraine&#x2019;s to carry out meaningful work that truly impacts their communities. The sudden freeze of U.S. aid has caused harm to independent Ukrainian journalism on par with the COVID-19 pandemic and the onset of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war. If not renewed soon, its impact can surpass both in severity. The Kyiv Independent was not impacted by the U.S. aid freeze, as we do not receive grants funded by U.S. taxpayers. Thanks to our strong community of 14,000 members, we remained secure. However, we did receive such grants in 2022 and 2023 while we were still growing our community. They were instrumental in giving us the runway to become sustainable. These grants came with no editorial restrictions and only bolstered our journalism. But around us, other Ukrainian media have been severely affected. Many were forced to stop most of their operations immediately, as demanded by aid distributors. Many are uncertain whether funding will resume once the 90-day freeze ends. If Trump&#x2019;s team only greenlights funding that aligns with his foreign policy, will independent media in Ukraine make the cut? No one knows. But here&#x2019;s what we know for certain: A healthy society cannot exist without free media. A functional democracy depends on it. And in a world increasingly plagued by disinformation, genuine journalism is more essential than ever. There is something you can do. You can donate to Ukrainian media impacted by the freeze on U.S. aid. Here are several organizations we know well and how to support them. This is not an exhaustive list &#x2014; we encourage you to support any independent Ukrainian media of your choice. Tsukr is an independent local media outlet in Sumy, northern Ukraine, just over 28 kilometers (18 miles) from the Russian border and frequently targeted by Russian attacks. Despite these challenges, the team remains a vital source of information and inspiration for their community. The U.S. aid freeze cut about 60% of their funding. You can support them through a one-time donation or a Patreon subscription. Gwara Media is an independent local news site in Kharkiv, Ukraine&#x2019;s second largest city, located near the Russian border and frequently battered by attacks. Due to its proximity to Russia, missiles often hit the city before air raid alerts sound. The resilience of this team mirrors that of their city. You can support them via PayPal or Buy Me a Coffee. Bihus.Info is an investigative journalism platform dedicated to uncovering corruption, responsible for some of the most groundbreaking investigations in modern Ukrainian history. Since 2022, they have also been publishing front-line video reports. You can support them through Patreon or by clicking &#x201C;Join&#x201D; on their YouTube channel. Ukrainer is a platform that shares stories about Ukraine&apos;s culture, history, and society, offering unique content in multiple languages and largely run by volunteers. Since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022, it has focused on documenting Ukraine&#x2019;s resilience, resistance, and humanitarian efforts.

Putin afraid of negotiations' — Zelensky hits back after Kremlin leader labels him 'illegitimate'	President Volodymyr Zelensky on Jan. 28 accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of deliberately prolonging the war and avoiding peace negotiations. &quot;Today, Putin once again proved that he is afraid of negotiations, afraid of strong leaders, and is doing everything possible to drag out the war. Every step he takes, every cynical maneuver, is aimed at making this war endless,&quot; Zelensky said, as Putin reiterated on state TV that he considers Zelensky &quot;illegitimate&quot; and incapable of signing any agreements in potential peace talks. &quot;Negotiations can be held with anyone,&quot; Putin said on Jan. 28. &quot;But due to (Zelensky&apos;s) illegitimacy he has no right to sign anything. If (Zelensky) wants to take part in talks, I will delegate people who will conduct such talks. But the (key) issue is the ultimate signing of the documents.&quot; The claim, widely used in Russian propaganda, has been dismissed by Ukrainian legal experts as baseless. Zelensky emphasized in his post on X that there is a real opportunity to achieve peace, but Putin is actively working against it. &quot;Instead of pursuing peace, Putin is either continuing large-scale killings or seeking a pause to prepare for another full-scale invasion using hybrid attacks,&quot; Zelensky added. Zelensky also urged global leaders to learn from past mistakes. &quot;Putin may have immense power to destroy, but his heart is too small and cowardly to withstand real pressure from strong leaders,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-afraid-of-negotiations-zelensky-hits-back-after-kremlin-leader-labels-him-illegitimate/	2025-01-28T13:56:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1850857121.jpg
Defense Minister Umerov under investigation for possible abuse of power, office position, media reports	The National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) has launched a criminal investigation into the potential abuse of power, as well as office position by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported on Jan. 28, citing NABU&apos;s statement. On Jan. 23, the Defense Procurement Agency&apos;s (DPA) supervisory board &#xA0;voted unanimously to extend current director Maryna Bezrukova&apos;s contract for another year. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov however overruled the board&apos;s decision on Jan. 24, saying he would not renew Bezrukova&apos;s contract as head of the DPA. He cited allegedly unsatisfactory results as the reason and appointed Rustem Zhmadilov, who also manages the State Logistics Operator (DOT). Umerov also dismissed two agency supervisory board members, Taras Chmut and Yuriy Dzhyhyr. Following Umerov&apos;s move, the Anti-Corruption Action Center filed a complaint with NABU to open an investigation against Umerov on suspicion of alleged abuse of power. Proceedings against Umerov opened at the request of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, NABU said. According to Ukrainian law, if officials have abused their power or position in a manner leading to &quot;serious consequences,&quot;they are punishable by imprisonment for three to six years and disqualification from holding certain positions or engaging in certain activities for up to three years. They must also pay a fine, ranging from Hr 757,000 ($18,000) to Hr 1,514,000 ($36,000). According to Ukrainian law, supervisory boards have the authority to hire and fire the heads of state enterprises unilaterally. This means that legally, after the board&apos;s vote, Bezrukova should take over the Defense Procurement Agency for another year. However, due to amendments recently made to the agency&apos;s charter by the Defense Ministry, which oversees the DPA, the ministry can reverse the supervisory board&apos;s decisions. Anti-corruption activists and lawmakers say the amendments and Umerov&apos;s decision are unlawful. Following Umerov&apos;s move, DPA declared that it continues to operate under Bezrukova&apos;s leadership. Bezrukova took over the agency in January 2024, and her contract expires at the end of January 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/defense-minister-umerov-under-investigation-for-possible-abuse-of-power-office-position/	2025-01-28T12:34:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/MNM_2451.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Putin claims Zelensky doesn't have a right to sign any potential peace deal	Key developments on Jan. 28: Russian President Vladimir Putin has reiterated his claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is &quot;illegitimate&quot; and said that he has no right to sign any documents in potential peace negotiations, according to an interview with the state TV channel Rossiya 1 broadcast on Jan. 28. &quot;Negotiations can be held with anyone,&quot; Putin said. &quot;But due to (Zelensky&apos;s) illegitimacy he has no right to sign anything. If (Zelensky) wants to take part in talks, I will delegate people who will conduct such talks. But the (key) issue is the ultimate signing of the documents.&quot; Russia has widely used the claim that Zelensky is illegitimate in its propaganda in an effort to discredit the Ukrainian government. Major Ukrainian constitutional lawyers and legal experts believe the claim is false and unfounded. Putin also mentioned Zelensky&apos;s Sept. 30, 2022 decree to ban negotiations with Putin. The move came in response to Russia&apos;s illegal annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, which are partially occupied. Putin claimed that, due to his alleged illegitimacy, Zelensky cannot lift his ban on negotiations with Russia. The decree should be revoked before such negotiations begin, and the &quot;legitimacy&quot; of Ukrainian negotiators should be &quot;verified by lawyers,&quot; Putin added. &quot;If we start negotiations now, they will be illegitimate. There is a problem here: when the current head of the regime signed this decree (on banning negotiations), he was a legitimate president, and now he cannot revoke it,&quot; Putin said. He claimed that the decree can only be revoked by the speaker of Ukraine&apos;s parliament, who must have become the country&apos;s acting president after the alleged expiry of Zelensky&apos;s term. &quot;If there is a will, any issue of a legal nature can be resolved. But so far, we haven&apos;t seen such willingness,&quot; Putin said. Under the martial law act passed by Ukraine after Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, presidential, parliamentary and local elections are banned. If martial law had not been imposed, the next presidential election would have been held on March 31, 2024, and Zelensky&apos;s term would have ended on May 20, 2024. Some of Zelensky&apos;s critics claim that the Constitution does not authorize extending his presidential term under martial law. They argue that he ceased to be a legitimate president on May 20. But leading constitutional lawyers dispute this claim, saying the Constitution allows such an extension. Earlier, Putin said that Russia is prepared to hold talks with U.S. President Donald Trump regarding the war in Ukraine. Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov on Jan. 28 refuted the Russian Defense Ministry&apos;s claims that Russian forces had captured the village of Dvorichna in the Kupiansk district, emphasizing that fighting in the area is ongoing, Ukrinform reported. &quot;This is not the first statement of this kind from the Russian side; it is pure propaganda and does not reflect reality,&quot; Syniehubov said. Located 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Kharkiv and 17 kilometers (10 miles) north of Kupiansk, Dvorichna sits on the western bank of the Oskil River, a key geographic feature in the region. Russia has been attempting to secure a foothold on this bank for months, aiming to outflank Ukrainian defenses and threaten a rear attack in Kupiansk.

(DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Andrii Besedin, head of the Kupiansk town military administration, noted earlier in January that Russian troops were trying to establish a bridgehead in Dvorichna to facilitate further advances. Russian forces have ramped up operations near Kupiansk since September, reaching the industrial outskirts of the town in the northeast. Ukrainian troops successfully repelled multiple Russian assaults throughout December. The Italian parliament&apos;s lower house on Jan. 28 approved the prolongation of military support for Ukraine until Dec. 31, 2025, the Italian news agency ANSA reported. Earlier, the Italian Senate approved the measure with 192 votes in favor and 41 against. The parliamentary opposition was divided on the decision to extend military aid to Ukraine. Three parties supported the decision, while two parties opposed it. Italy&apos;s 10 military aid packages to Ukraine have included advanced weapons systems like the French-Italian SAMP/T air defense units. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Jan. 16 that Ukraine would receive another military aid package from Italy. Prior to that, Umerov met his Italian counterpart, Guido Crosetto, in Kyiv. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who took office in late 2022, has consistently supported Kyiv and pledged unwavering assistance until the war ends. Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) reported on Jan. 28 that it had dismantled a Russian spy network tasked with gathering intelligence on Ukrainian aircraft for strikes on aviation infrastructure. The operation, conducted near a military airfield, led to the arrest of two agents who were caught photographing a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet during takeoff, the SBU said. The SBU identified the suspects as two residents of Kremenchuk in Poltava Oblast, aged 22 and 21, recruited by a female officer of Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB) whose identity has been established. The agents were allegedly tasked with collecting detailed information on military airfields housing F-16 jets and helicopters, including their geolocation and photographic evidence. This intelligence was reportedly intended to help Russia adjust its missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian aviation facilities. To fulfill their mission, the agents planned to travel across five regions of Ukraine, using public transportation and renting short-term accommodations near airfields for espionage purposes. The SBU said it had intercepted and documented their reconnaissance efforts at an early stage, preventing any successful data transfer. Both suspects were detained while photographing an F-16 jet and have been taken into custody. They now face life imprisonment on treason charges. Ukraine received its first F-16 jets in August 2024, a year after the NATO-led fighter jet coalition pledged to train Ukrainian pilots and supply aircraft. Despite challenges, including a deadly crash during a massive Russian attack on Aug. 26, Ukrainian pilots have effectively used the jets to counter Russian aerial threats. Ukraine&apos;s government has confirmed the dismissal of Dmytro Klimenkov from his position as deputy defense minister, said Taras Melnychuk, the government&apos;s parliamentary representative, on Jan. 28. The decision follows ongoing tensions within the Defense Ministry over its weapons procurement process, which has been heavily scrutinized amid reform efforts. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced Klimenkov&apos;s dismissal last week, claiming his deputy had &quot;failed&quot; the task of defense procurement. Concurrently, Umerov said he would not renew Maryna Bezrukova&apos;s contract as head of the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA). Klimenkov joined the Defense Ministry from the State Property Fund, where he worked under Umerov&apos;s leadership. Appointed deputy defense minister on Oct. 5, 2023, he was responsible for overseeing procurement for the Armed Forces. Bezrukova, appointed in January 2024 to lead procurement reforms following corruption scandals, had her contract extended by the DPA&apos;s supervisory board earlier this month. Under Ukrainian law, supervisory boards can hire and fire state enterprise leaders, making Umerov&apos;s refusal to renew her contract legally contentious. Anti-corruption activists and lawmakers criticized the move, labeling it &quot;unlawful&quot; and warning that such actions could undermine efforts to reform Ukraine&apos;s defense procurement system. Bezrukova&apos;s tenure highlighted internal disputes over procurement practices. At the start of her role, Bezrukova reported pressure from Klimenkov to sign a contract for 500,000 artillery shells from a manufacturer owned by the Strategic Industries Ministry.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-denies-capture-of-another-village-in-kharkiv-oblast-italy-extents-military-assistance-for-ukraine-in-2025/	2025-01-28T12:32:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1250824254.jpg

What Trump's first week in office says about his stance on Ukraine	For those with a vested interest in Ukraine, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s first week in office was a bit of a rollercoaster. His inauguration speech on Jan. 21 made no explicit mention of Ukraine or Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, prompting some to question if either was anywhere near a priority for the new president. During his first presidential term, Trump famously praised Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has also repeatedly criticized U.S. aid to Ukraine during the election campaign ahead of his second term, prompting many in Ukraine and the West to worry about the future of assistance from Ukraine&#x2019;s biggest donor. &quot;I can&#x2019;t say if things will be better for us (now Trump has been inaugurated) because Trump is definitely not a sympathizer of Ukraine,&quot; &#x201C;Volvo,&#x201D; a Ukrainian military medic told the Kyiv Independent at the time. But a few hours later, comments from Trump began to give an indication that he was at least open to taking a hard line on Russia, saying he would likely impose additional sanctions against Moscow if Putin fails to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine. &quot;Sounds likely,&quot; he said responding to a question from a reporter in the White House. While the off-hand comment wasn&apos;t anything close to a policy announcement, on Jan. 22, Trump took to his social media platform Truth Social and came out guns blazing, saying he would be doing Putin &quot;a very big favor&quot; by helping end the war. &quot;If a deal is not reached, I will have no other choice but to put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries,&quot; he said. &quot;We can do it the easy way or the hard way,&quot; he said in reference to negotiating an end to the war, adding, &quot;the easy way is always better.&quot; While stressing that he is &quot;not looking to hurt Russia&quot; and maintaining that he has &quot;always had a very good relationship&quot; with Putin, Trump added, &quot;It&apos;s time to make a deal. No more lives should be lost.&quot; Ambassador Kurt Volker, who served as U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations in 2017-2019, during Trump&#x2019;s previous tenure, told the Kyiv Independent: &quot;These are very strong statements coming from Trump.&#x201D; &quot;And they do a couple of things. They establish that Putin is the one who has to act &#x2014; it&apos;s not both sides that need to show restraint. This is all &apos;Russia has to stop the war, Putin has to stop,&apos;&quot; he said. &quot;Secondly, it&apos;s establishing that Putin is in a weak position and Trump is in a strong position, which is also very good.&quot; Trump doubled down on his position while appearing via videolink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan 23. U.S. President Donald Trump is seen on a giant screen during his address by video conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 23, 2025. (Fabrice Coffrini / AFP via Getty Images)Asked if there would be a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia by the time of next year&apos;s World Economic Forum, he replied: &quot;Well you&apos;ll have to ask Russia. Ukraine is ready to make a deal.&quot; Volker said such comments were important to &quot;get that psychological dynamic straight&quot; as Trump defines his relationship with Putin before peace negotiations begin, adding that the fact Putin later responded showed it worked. Speaking to reporters on Jan. 24, Putin claimed Russia was ready for talks with Trump on ending the war in Ukraine, but made a clumsy attempt to shift blame for them not starting onto President Volodymyr Zelensky. He pointed out a decree signed by Zelensky in October 2022 which declared negotiations with Putin &quot;impossible&quot; while leaving the door open to discussions with Russia under different leadership. Zelensky signed the decree after Russia announced the illegal annexation of four Ukrainian regions, all of which it only partially controlled. &quot;How can negotiations be resumed if they are officially banned?&quot; Putin asked. &quot;This is a deflection by Putin,&quot; Volker said, adding his claim about being ready to talk was a &quot;lie.&quot; &quot;He knows very well that Zelensky has said he wants to end the war,&quot; he added. In Ukraine, Trump&apos;s strong stance on Russia has been welcomed, but cautiously, tempered by an expectation that Putin has little desire to enter peace negotiations regardless of the threats coming from the U.S. &quot;The problem is not Trump, his ideas or expectations, the problem is Putin,&quot; Oleksandr Merezhko, the chair of the Ukrainian parliament&apos;s foreign affairs committee, told the Kyiv Independent. Merezhko said he expected Trump to soon become &quot;disillusioned&quot; with Putin when he doesn&apos;t respond to the threats. &quot;I hope that Trump will have to take a firmer stance on Putin, as soon as he realizes that Putin has no intention to negotiate in earnest,&quot; he added. While Trump may have quietly discarded his claim that he could end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion &quot;in 24 hours,&quot; his comments during his first week still indicate he believes he can end the war relatively swiftly &#x2014; but time may actually be on Putin&apos;s side. Aside from the threats about sanctions, Trump also said at Davos he would ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to lower the price of oil, saying it would end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine &quot;immediately.&quot; OPEC consists of 12 countries including Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, which collectively account for around 30% of the global oil supply. By agreeing to lower or raise the amount of oil they all produce, OPEC can dramatically affect the global oil price. Another Trump policy &#x2014; declaring open season on drilling for U.S. oil and gas &#x2014; could also potentially push down prices and box out Russian oil.

(Alexander Manzyuk/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)More sanctions and lower global oil prices would deplete Russia&apos;s main source of revenue that it uses to fund its war in Ukraine, but a recent analysis in Foreign Policy suggested any effects would likely take months to significantly hamper the Kremlin&apos;s war machine. On the streets of Kyiv, there is little expectation that Trump will be able to end the war swiftly, or even that he can do it at all, and that ultimately, it is still up to Ukrainians to fight for it themselves. &quot;For now, it&apos;s too early to judge (Trump),&quot; 18-year-old student Mykola told the Kyiv Independent on Jan. 28, adding: &quot;I think we can only bring peace by our own actions.&quot; &quot;The only thing that can affect Russia is that we will make our shells and destroy the Russians directly at the front.&quot; According to Volker, the next step for the Trump administration will be a visit to Kyiv and other European capitals by Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s peace envoy for Ukraine, during which he will be &quot;gathering perspectives and information&quot; which he will then brief his boss on. &quot;I think the best advice for the Trump team is to do exactly what Trump is doing &#x2014; keep it simple and don&apos;t get bogged down in these side issues that Russia will throw up like saying we need elections in Ukraine,&quot; he said. &quot;Putin will just make stuff up and we should not negotiate on that at all. We should say it&apos;s none of his business, just stop the war. And what we do is we get a ceasefire. And then we have to be strong so that we deter future attacks,&quot; he added.

Italian parliament extends military support for Ukraine through 2025	The Italian parliament&apos;s lower house on Jan. 28 approved the prolongation of military support for Ukraine until Dec. 31, 2025, the Italian news agency ANSA reported. Earlier, the Italian Senate approved the measure with 192 votes in favor and 41 against. The parliamentary opposition was divided on the decision to extend military aid to Ukraine. Three parties supported the decision, while two parties opposed it. Italy&apos;s 10 military aid packages to Ukraine have included advanced weapons systems like the French-Italian SAMP/T air defense units. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Jan. 16 that Ukraine would receive another military aid package from Italy. Prior to that, Umerov met his Italian counterpart, Guido Crosetto, in Kyiv. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who took office in late 2022, has consistently supported Kyiv and pledged unwavering assistance until the war ends.	https://kyivindependent.com/italian-parliament-approves-extension-of-military-assistance-to-ukraine-in-2025/	2025-01-28T10:41:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Zelensky-and-Meloni-1.jpeg
SBU says it dismantled Russian spy network targeting F-16 jets	Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) reported on Jan. 28 that it had dismantled a Russian spy network tasked with gathering intelligence on Ukrainian aircraft for strikes on aviation infrastructure. The operation, conducted near a military airfield, led to the arrest of two agents who were caught photographing a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet during takeoff, the SBU said. The SBU identified the suspects as two residents of Kremenchuk in Poltava Oblast, aged 22 and 21, recruited by a female officer of Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB) whose identity has been established. The agents were allegedly tasked with collecting detailed information on military airfields housing F-16 jets and helicopters, including their geolocation and photographic evidence. This intelligence was reportedly intended to help Russia adjust its missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian aviation facilities. To fulfill their mission, the agents planned to travel across five regions of Ukraine, using public transportation and renting short-term accommodations near airfields for espionage purposes. The SBU said it had intercepted and documented their reconnaissance efforts at an early stage, preventing any successful data transfer. Both suspects were detained while photographing an F-16 jet and have been taken into custody. They now face life imprisonment on treason charges. Ukraine received its first F-16 jets in August 2024, a year after the NATO-led fighter jet coalition pledged to train Ukrainian pilots and supply aircraft. Despite challenges, including a deadly crash during a massive Russian attack on Aug. 26, Ukrainian pilots have effectively used the jets to counter Russian aerial threats.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-dismantles-russian-fsb-spy-network-targeting-aircraft-f-16-jets/	2025-01-28T09:20:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/b439a0c86fc936789c31c532fb3406ee.jpeg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 11	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 11 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Jan. 13&#x2013;19, 2025. This newsletter was until recently titled &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief.&quot; The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Application process closes for head of Bureau of Economic Security The submission period for applications to compete for the position of head of the Bureau of Economic Security (known in Ukraine by its acronym BEB) has officially closed. While the exact number of candidates remains undisclosed, preliminary indications suggest a strong turnout, with over 40 individuals expected to have submitted their applications. Detailed information, including the list of candidates, is anticipated later this week. The selection process will now move to the verification stage, where applications will be reviewed for compliance with requirements. Following this, candidates will undergo a rigorous six-stage evaluation. The process includes assessments of general competencies, legislative knowledge, and the ability to resolve practical cases. Integrity checks will also be a mandatory component of the selection process. Ultimately, the commission overseeing the competition will choose no more than two finalists to advance. Ukrainian business associations warn against risks of repealing &apos;Lozovyi amendments&apos; According to Forbes Ukraine, several Ukrainian business associations, including SUP (Union of Ukrainian Entrepreneurs), Diia.City United, and the Federation of Employers of Ukraine, along with six other industry organizations, urged lawmakers to reject four draft laws proposing the repeal of certain provisions of the &quot;Lozovyi Amendments.&quot; The amendments, which regulate pre-trial investigation time limits, are part of a commitment Ukraine made under its memorandum with the IMF, with implementation expected by the end of December 2024. Business leaders warn that repealing these provisions could expose entrepreneurs to increased pressure from law enforcement and delay the closure of legal cases, further burdening the business environment. Integrity checks will also be a mandatory component of the selection process. Ultimately, the commission overseeing the competition will choose no more than two finalists to advance. Ukrainian defense minister replaces Defense Procurement Agency head, defying supervisory board decision On Jan. 23, the Supervisory Board of the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) voted to extend the contract of Maryna Bezrukova, the agency&#x2019;s current head, for another year. According to anti-corruption watchdogs, this decision fully complied with the law governing state-owned property and the agency&#x2019;s charter. However, on Jan. 24, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov publicly rejected the board&#x2019;s decision, refusing to recognize the contract extension. The minister also removed two state representatives from the Supervisory Board, Yuriy Dzhyhyr and Taras Chmut, and recommended dismissing Deputy Minister Dmytro Klimenkov, who oversees the DPA&#x2019;s operations. Umerov further announced plans to appoint Arsen Zhumadilov, head of the State Operator for Non-Lethal Acquisitions (DOT), as the new DPA Director. The leadership change has already been reflected in YouControl, a Ukrainian public registry system. On Jan. 25, Anastasia Radina, head of the Ukrainian parliament&#x2019;s anti-corruption committee, called on Umerov to resign. Radina accused the minister of undermining defense procurement reform and engaging in manual interference with procurement processes.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-11/	2025-01-28T09:06:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194027012--1-.jpg
NATO official ties assassination plot against Rheinmetall CEO to Russian sabotage campaign	Sabotage acts in NATO countries in recent years have included threats to assassinate weapons industry leaders, particularly the German arms maker Rheinmetall&apos;s CEO Armin Papperger, NATO&apos;s Deputy Assistant Secretary-General James Appathurai said on Jan. 28. Since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Russian hybrid operations aimed at destabilizing the situation in the countries that support Ukraine have intensified. Speaking at the European Parliament, Appathurai confirmed the threats against Papperger, which had previously been circulating only in the media, Reuters reported. In July 2024, U.S. and German intelligence discovered a Russian-linked plot to assassinate Papperger, according to CNN. Following the incident, Germany provided Papperger with the same top-level security as Chancellor Olaf Scholz. In April 2024, supporters of the left-wing extremist RAF movement announced that they had burned down Papperger&apos;s garden house, accusing him of &quot;profiting&quot; from arms sales. Appathurai also said that the West had sometimes succeeded in stopping Russia from committing acts of sabotage by setting red lines at the highest level. One example is when incendiary devices destined for DHL flights were detected in a German warehouse. According to Appathurai, the sabotage campaign included &quot;derailment of trains, acts of arson, attacks on politicians&apos; property, threats to plot to assassinate industry leaders like, publicly, the head of Rheinmetall, but there were other plots as well.&quot; Appathurai added that NATO characterizes the current level of sabotage as a &quot;record high.&quot; NATO allies clearly understand that they &quot;need to be more robust&quot; in responding to recurring incidents, particularly in the Baltic Sea, he added. NATO aims to agree on a strategy for tackling hybrid threats before the alliance&apos;s summit in The Hague at the end of June, according to Reuters. Rheinmetall provides weapons and equipment to Ukraine under contracts with the German government, such as Leopard 1 tanks, mortar shells, and drone surveillance systems, among other weapons. In late July, Rheinmetall announced that it had received an order from the Ukrainian government to begin the construction of an ammunition factory in Ukraine. The company previously said it planned to open at least four factories in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-ties-attempted-assassination-plot-against-rheinmetall-ceo-to-russian-sabotage-campaign/	2025-01-28T08:35:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2076692591.jpg
Russian oil sales to China and India stall as sanctions increase costs, Reuters reports	Trade for March-loading Russian oil in China and India has stalled due to soaring shipping costs triggered by U.S. sanctions introduced on Jan. 10, Reuters reported on Jan. 28. The sanctions target nearly 200 vessels in Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; major oil companies, and associated entities, significantly complicating Moscow&apos;s crude exports. The disruption has led to stalled trade in Russian crude loaded for March delivery as rising shipping costs created a significant price gap between buyers and sellers, according to Reuters. Offers for March ESPO Blend crude from Russia&apos;s Pacific port of Kozmino have jumped to premiums of $3&#x2013;$5 per barrel over ICE Brent on a delivered ex-ship (DES) basis to China, following a sharp surge in Aframax tanker freight rates by millions of dollars. Before the new sanctions, demand for Russian ESPO Blend crude was robust, with spot premiums rising to nearly $2 per barrel due to firming prices for competing Iranian grades and winter demand. India is also seeing a decline in Russian oil offers. Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd reported that no new offers for March deliveries have been received, with expectations for a drop in cargoes compared to January and December. Last year, Russian crude accounted for 36% of India&apos;s imports and nearly 20% of China&apos;s. Adding to the strain, Indian banks have blocked payments for Russian oil imports following the latest U.S. sanctions, Energy Intelligence reported. U.S. President Donald Trump warned Russia on Jan. 22 to &quot;make a deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine, cautioning that continued resistance would result in additional sanctions, tariffs, and taxes on Russian goods.	https://kyivindependent.com/china-india-halt-russian-oil-trade-over-rising-tanker-tariffs-media-reports/	2025-01-28T07:13:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1477537303.jpg
Uzbekistan Airways reroute European flights to avoid Russia, Belarus as 'precaution'	Uzbekistan Airways airliners have changed their routes when flying to Europe to avoid Russian and Belarusian airspace as a &quot;precautionary measure,&quot; the Uzbek news outlet Repost reported on Jan. 28. The news comes a month after an Azerbaijani airliner crashed in Kazakhstan after flying through the Russian airspace. Baku said that Russian air defenses mistakenly opened fire against the plane, bringing it down and killing 38 of the 67 people on board. &quot;These are simply precautionary measures and, to some extent, route optimization,&quot; the press service of Uzbekistan Airways was quoted as saying by Repost, claiming the change is not directly connected to the downing of the Azerbaijani plane. Since Jan. 20, Uzbekistan Airways airliners fly over Azerbaijan and Turkey when heading west. The Azerbaijani airliner was traveling from Baku to Grozny in Russia&apos;s Chechen Republic on Dec. 25, 2024, but was forced to change course and crashed near the Kazakh city of Aktau. Independent observers and Azerbaijani officials said that it was hit unintentionally by Russian air defense fire while attempting to land at Grozny&#x2019;s airport. The airport was allegedly under a Ukrainian drone attack, and Russia&#x2019;s military failed to notify the airport in time to deny all civilian passenger planes entry into its airspace to avoid suffering fire by the activated anti-air missile system. Russian authorities claimed the plane crashed due to hitting birds, but Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev directly accused Russia of downing the plane and demanded an admission of guilt and reparations, straining relations among otherwise close allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/uzbek-airliners-reroute-european-flights-to-avoid-russia-belarus/	2025-01-28T06:14:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1138938336.jpg
Pure propaganda' — Kharkiv Oblast governor denies Russian claims of capturing Dvorichna	Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov on Jan. 28 refuted the Russian Defense Ministry&apos;s claims that Russian forces had captured the village of Dvorichna in the Kupiansk district, emphasizing that fighting in the area is ongoing, Ukrinform reported. &quot;This is not the first statement of this kind from the Russian side; it is pure propaganda and does not reflect reality,&quot; Syniehubov said. Located 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Kharkiv and 17 kilometers (10 miles) north of Kupiansk, Dvorichna sits on the western bank of the Oskil River, a key geographic feature in the region. Russia has been attempting to secure a foothold on this bank for months, aiming to outflank Ukrainian defenses and threaten a rear attack in Kupiansk.

(DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Andrii Besedin, head of the Kupiansk town military administration, noted earlier in January that Russian troops were trying to establish a bridgehead in Dvorichna to facilitate further advances.

Ukrainian troops successfully repelled multiple Russian assaults throughout December.	https://kyivindependent.com/pure-propaganda-kharkiv-governor-denies-russian-claims-of-capturing-dvorichna/	2025-01-28T05:50:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1797516659.jpeg
Russian physiologist Pavlov’s statue dismantled in central Kyiv	Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov&#x2019;s statue was removed from Kyiv&#x2019;s Pechersk district over symbolizing Russia&#x2019;s imperial past and Pavlov&apos;s controversial experiments on animals, the Kyiv city administration said on Jan. 27. During centuries of Russian imperial rule, Moscow imposed the supremacy of the Russian language, nation, and culture over Ukraine. The Russian cultural dominance largely continued during the Soviet period, and statues for Russian figures were erected until Ukraine gained independence in 1991. Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion has accelerated Ukraine&apos;s efforts to de-Russify public spaces. According to the city&apos;s administration, Kyiv authorities have removed 59 objects as part of the campaign since 2022. Pavlov&apos;s monument is currently placed in a specialized site and will be transferred to the Oleg Antonov State Aviation Museum in Kyiv, where similar objects are stored. The decision on the monument&apos;s removal was made in July 2023. Pavlov, who lived between 1849 and 1936, was born and spent much of his life in modern-day Russia. While considered a pioneer in neurology and physiology, the founder of classical conditioning has also been accused of conducting cruel experiments on animals, most famously dogs.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-physiologist-pavlovs-statue-removed-from-central-kyiv/	2025-01-28T05:43:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/thumb_418869_800_600_0_0_auto-1.jpg
3 key takeaways from Davos from Ukraine’s economy minister	The discussions at the World Economic Forum in Davos were a stark reminder of how interconnected the global economy is, and how Ukraine&#x2019;s stability &#x2014; or lack thereof &#x2014; affects us all. From military aid to economic sanctions, the steps we take now will shape the future not just for Ukraine, but for the world. The war Russia has unleashed on Ukraine is not only a threat to our country, but also a destabilizing force for the entire world economy. One of the clearest signs of this disruption was the unprecedented surge in global wheat prices, soaring to over $450 per ton in spring 2022, driving hunger across the globe. Or consider the speculative spike in gas prices last year when Russia attacked Ukraine&#x2019;s underground gas storage facilities. Every missile Russia targets at Ukraine is a strike at the heart of the global economy. If we are serious about global stability, we must address the root cause: Russia&#x2019;s aggression. As long as instability persists in Ukraine, it will reverberate around the world. Here are the key takeaways from Davos that underscore the shared responsibility we all have in securing Ukraine&#x2019;s future. First, military and economic aid have been, and must remain, at the forefront of our efforts. In partnership with governments, businesses, and financial institutions, we&#x2019;ve created a robust ecosystem that has kept Ukraine standing. This support drives recovery and development, particularly in defense technology, and it has allowed Ukraine&#x2019;s economy to stay afloat in the face of unrelenting war. As &#x201C;The Economist&#x201D; rightly put it, Ukraine is winning the economic war &#x2014; an accomplishment that belongs to all of us. Second, sanctions and blocking Russia&#x2019;s shadow fleet have long been vital tools in the fight against Russian aggression. U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s recent comments in Davos about Russian oil are a step in the right direction. The numbers back it up: According to the Kyiv School of Economics, Russia has lost a staggering $78.5 billion in oil export revenue since December 2022 due to sanctions. The oil tanker Eagle S is anchored near Kilpilahti port in Porvoo, Gulf of Finland, on Jan. 13, 2025. (Vesa Moilanen / Lehtikuva / AFP)The private sector must play its part too. I call on business leaders worldwide to withdraw from the Russian market. Such actions are as effective as sanctions, delivering a direct blow to the Russian economy. The idea that business is somehow apolitical is outdated &#x2014; businesses are powerful forces that can shape outcomes, for better or for worse. And third, a strong economy supports a strong military. That&#x2019;s why our vision for a self-sufficient economy is grounded in five key steps: expanding export logistics, restoring energy capacities, confiscating Russia&#x2019;s sovereign assets to support Ukraine&#x2019;s recovery, investing in the defense industry and Ukrainian companies, and encouraging the return of Ukrainians to Ukraine. While the Ukrainian government has focused on industrial policy &#x2014; contributing to economic growth even in the third year of full-scale war, with a projected 3.6% growth rate in 2024 &#x2014; private companies have an equally critical role in shaping long-term security guarantees for Ukraine. Security measures have already shown their value. Take the Black Sea Grain Corridor, for example. Initially blocked by Russia, the corridor was only reopened when we secured military protection for the routes and installed air defense systems to safeguard export infrastructure. This allowed Ukrainian exports to grow by 15% last year. To kickstart Ukraine&#x2019;s large-scale reconstruction and stabilize the global economy, Ukraine needs long-term security guarantees. This is not just a Ukrainian issue &#x2014; it&#x2019;s a global responsibility, one shared by Ukraine, its partners, and the private sector.

Spanish Foreign Minister Albares visits Ukraine to reaffirm support amid war	Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares arrived in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Jan. 28, reaffirming Spain&apos;s support for Ukraine amid Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. &quot;This year will be a year of peace,&quot; Albares wrote on X, emphasizing Spain&apos;s commitment to a &quot;just peace&quot; that ensures Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty and freedom. The Spanish Foreign Ministry outlined three primary objectives for the trip: reinforcing political and diplomatic backing, providing humanitarian aid, and protecting Ukraine&apos;s cultural heritage, according to the Spanish news outlet La Razon. During his visit, Albares is set to hold talks with his Ukrainian counterpart, Andrii Sybiha, to discuss Spain&apos;s political support and its role in Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction. &quot;I am grateful to Spain for its support and look forward to meaningful talks today,&quot; Sybiha said. The two officials met ahead of the discussions to honor fallen Ukrainian soldiers at the Lychakiv cemetery in Lviv. In May, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement, under which Spain pledged 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in aid for 2024 and 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion) by 2027. This support encompasses economic, military, and humanitarian assistance.	https://kyivindependent.com/spanish-foreign-minister-albares-visits-ukraine-to-reaffirm-support-amid-war/	2025-01-28T05:03:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-28_12-13-51.jpg
EU considering new trade regime with Ukraine, media reports	The European Union does not plan to extend the preferential trade agreement framework in its current form past its June 5 expiration date and is considering a new set of rules instead, the Polish news portal RMF24 reported on Jan. 28. While the European Commission allegedly does not plan to reinstate pre-invasion trade rules, it is considering alternatives within the 2016 Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) framework, including quotas for agricultural products and additional safeguards. The EU lifted customs duties on Ukrainian agricultural products in 2022 to alleviate the country&apos;s economy amid Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. This led to large-scale protests among European farmers, namely in Poland, who claimed the influx of cheaper Ukrainian products was threatening their businesses. The newly proposed framework would establish specific export and import volumes, potentially aiding Ukraine&apos;s integration into the EU single market while addressing concerns from member states about agricultural imports. European Agriculture Commissioner Christophe Hansen reportedly noted widespread support among agriculture ministers for transitioning to a &quot;more stable DCFTA agreement&quot; instead of extending the current regime. Preliminary technical negotiations between the EU and Ukraine have reportedly begun, with formal discussions expected soon. The EU&apos;s current free-trade scheme has already been updated with an automatic safeguard mechanism for sensitive sectors, such as eggs, poultry, sugar, oats, maize, hulled grains, and honey. Poland has implemented import bans on certain Ukrainian products, such as grain, citing negative impacts on Polish agriculture.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-considers-new-trade-framework-with-ukraine/	2025-01-28T04:44:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-497631536.jpg
Government dismisses Deputy Defense Minister Klimenkov amid procurement tensions	Ukraine&apos;s government has confirmed the dismissal of Dmytro Klimenkov from his position as deputy defense minister, said Taras Melnychuk, the government&apos;s parliamentary representative, on Jan. 28. The decision follows ongoing tensions within the Defense Ministry over its weapons procurement process, which has been heavily scrutinized amid reform efforts. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced Klimenkov&apos;s dismissal last week, claiming his deputy had &quot;failed&quot; the task of defense procurement. Concurrently, Umerov said he would not renew Maryna Bezrukova&apos;s contract as head of the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA). Klimenkov joined the Defense Ministry from the State Property Fund, where he worked under Umerov&apos;s leadership. Appointed deputy defense minister on Oct. 5, 2023, he was responsible for overseeing procurement for the Armed Forces. Bezrukova, appointed in January 2024 to lead procurement reforms following corruption scandals, had her contract extended by the DPA&apos;s supervisory board earlier this month. Under Ukrainian law, supervisory boards can hire and fire state enterprise leaders, making Umerov&apos;s refusal to renew her contract legally contentious. Anti-corruption activists and lawmakers criticized the move, labeling it &quot;unlawful&quot; and warning that such actions could undermine efforts to reform Ukraine&apos;s defense procurement system. Bezrukova&apos;s tenure highlighted internal disputes over procurement practices. At the start of her role, Bezrukova reported pressure from Klimenkov to sign a contract for 500,000 artillery shells from a manufacturer owned by the Strategic Industries Ministry. She expressed concerns about the company&apos;s limited production capacity, workforce shortages, and gunpowder deficit. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) also investigated the manufacturer&apos;s director and a manager for inflating prices. An initial Defense Ministry inspection supported Bezrukova&apos;s concerns, estimating the company&apos;s capacity at 300,000&#x2013;350,000 shells. However, the ministry later reversed its assessment, asserting that the company could meet the contract requirements. Despite reservations, Bezrukova signed the contract. By the summer, the manufacturer fell behind schedule. When Klimenkov asked her to extend delivery deadlines, Bezrukova refused and pushed for alternative suppliers, straining her relationship with ministry officials. The Defense Ministry announced on Nov. 26 that it was investigating the contract and would pivot to delivering imported shells instead.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-dismisses-deputy-defense-minister-klimenkov-amid-procurement-tensions/	2025-01-28T04:18:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/_KZT9409-1.jpg
Swedish police detain man for trying to drive car into Russian Embassy grounds	A man attempted to drive a passenger car through the gates of Russia&#x2019;s Embassy in Stockholm on Jan. 28, the Swedish television channel SVT Nyheter reported. Shortly after the Embassy&#x2019;s notice, the Swedish police arrived at the scene and detained the suspected perpetrator. The incident occurred in the early hours of Jan. 28. The Swedish media reported that the suspect was a 45-year-old man but said his nationality is unknown. No injuries were reported in the incident, which is investigated as &quot;gross trespassing.&quot; Russia&#x2019;s Embassy to Sweden alleged the man was of Ukrainian origin and had been attempting to break into the territory of the Embassy and Russia&#x2019;s trade representation in Stockholm in 2015 and 2018. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. This is not the first time the Embassy has been targeted. An unidentified drone dropped paint on the building in late 2024. Sweden&#x2019;s Embassy in Moscow was also vandalized before that incident. Tensions between Western countries and Russia have mounted since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/swedish-police-detain-man-for-attempting-to-ram-car-into-russian-emassy/	2025-01-28T04:13:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1231048150.jpg
Davos heard Ukraine’s call, but will Europe seize the opportunity?	&#x201C;We&#x2019;re at yet another turning point,&#x201D; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told global leaders in Davos last week, &#x201C;which some see as a problem for Europe, but others call a chance. Europe must establish itself as a strong global player, as an indispensable player.&#x201D; Zelensky is completely right. He is also correct &#x2014; as was emphasized both by Ukraine&#x2019;s government delegation and during events at Ukraine House Davos &#x2014; that realizing Ukraine&#x2019;s potential is critical to creating a strong Europe: economically, technologically, and geopolitically. Europe must invest to unlock this potential. Geopolitically, Europe desperately needs to strengthen its military capabilities and revitalize its defense industry. Ukraine has the largest and most experienced military in Europe and some of the world&#x2019;s most advanced drone technology. Its defense industry has demonstrated an exceptional ability to rapidly scale up high-quality production at low cost &#x2014; exactly what Europe requires. The success of the green energy transition, which is key to European energy independence, depends on access to critical raw materials. Ukraine has some of the largest deposits of these resources in the world and can act as a catalyst for a Europe powered by cheap and abundant renewable energy, fueling a vibrant economy. Europe is also lagging in technology, while Ukraine boasts one of the strongest tech sectors in the region. The entrepreneurial attitudes and deep pool of tech talent in Ukraine are exactly what Europe needs to regain its position as a global leader in innovation. As Europe grapples with challenges related to immigration, Ukraine&#x2019;s robust agricultural sector can also help address global food insecurity. Ukraine&#x2019;s recent contributions to Syria are an example of its ability to support some of the world&#x2019;s poorest nations. Perhaps the most desperately needed resource Ukraine brings to Europe is something else altogether: grit and ambition. It&#x2019;s remarkable that Europe often acts and thinks as if it is weak &#x2014; when it is, or should be, anything but. Europe remains the richest and most economically advanced region in the world outside the United States. It also includes some of the fastest-growing economies, such as Poland, the Czech Republic, and the Baltic states. Geopolitically, Europe&#x2019;s recent history is one of triumph, not decline. In the year I was born, the eastern border of free Europe passed through Germany. Since then, the European Union has doubled in size, successfully integrating states once under Soviet control or influence. For the first time in history, nearly all of Europe is united both geopolitically and economically &#x2014; a feat unmatched even by the Romans. Instead of wondering about U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s next move, the world&#x2019;s focus should be on Europe. Did the messages land? In the Swiss mountains, at least, Ukraine&#x2019;s pitch seemed to resonate with political leaders and investors. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen how nods of agreement will translate into practical actions.

(Stefan Wermuth / Bloomberg via Getty Images)I, for one, am optimistic. Trump has ended a long period of uncertainty about the U.S. position by clearly stating that Russia &#x2014; not Ukraine &#x2014; needs to be pressured for lasting peace to be achieved. His message that Europe must take greater responsibility for its own security, including Ukraine&#x2019;s, is also welcome. While &#x201C;America First&#x201D; poses both economic and geopolitical risks for Europe, it also adds urgency to Ukraine&#x2019;s message about the need for European strength. This creates fertile ground for increasing foreign investment in Ukraine&#x2019;s military capabilities and defense industry &#x2014; a point underscored by former Ukrainian Strategic Industries Minister Oleksandr Kamyshin and his team during a marathon of bilateral meetings in Davos. Many remain skeptical about civilian private sector investments in Ukraine while the war continues. But this skepticism is overblown. Right now, even as it fights for its existence, Ukraine is one of the fastest-growing economies in Europe. The end of the war, along with Ukraine&#x2019;s future accession to the EU, represents additional opportunities for growth &#x2014; not prerequisites for investment. Conversations with investors already active in Ukraine confirm this. While the war presents serious challenges, pragmatic and resilient businesses continue to thrive &#x2014; strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s economy now and laying the foundation for future growth. Nervous investors who believe visiting Ukraine is too dangerous are deluding themselves out of the most important European growth opportunity of the 21st century. Ukraine House Davos directly challenged foreign investors to muster some courage by offering free Ukrzaliznytsia train ticket vouchers at their events. Not all will take the opportunity, but enough will to make a difference.

Trump’s Russia sanctions might be what finally works	Just one week into his presidency, U.S. President Donald Trump has hinted at his approach to U.S. sanctions on Russia. On Truth Social last week, he called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to &#x201C;settle now and STOP this ridiculous War! IT&#x2019;S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE,&#x201D; adding, &#x201C;If we don&#x2019;t make a &#x2018;deal,&#x2019; and soon, I have no other choice but to put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States, and various other participating countries.&#x201D; This not-so-subtle threat targets not only the Kremlin but also nations still doing business with Russia. Writing in these pages in November, I noted two points. First, Trump is no stranger to using sanctions and other coercive economic tools. During his first term, Trump leveraged sanctions expansively against Iran, Venezuela, and North Korea. Second, Trump loves making deals, and in doing so, he needs to win, avoid appearing weak, and, if possible, generate profit for the American people. Trump&#x2019;s Truth Social post was thus predictable, but it raises several questions, chief among them: &quot;What sort of deal?&quot; and &quot;What kind of sanctions? The answer to the second question is somewhat easier to predict than the first. After three years of escalating sanctions, trade, and financial restrictions on Russia, Ukraine&#x2019;s allies have undoubtedly had an effect. But the slow and laborious pace at which sanctions have been revealed has allowed Russia to adapt and minimize disruption. Many point to the parlous state of the Russian economy, its high inflation rate, and economic slowdown. This is true, and indeed, 2025 looks set to be the toughest year for the Russian economy since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion. But will it be tough enough to force Putin to rethink if sufficient revenue &#x2014; particularly from the sale of oil &#x2014; continues to flow in? And herein lies the possible foundation of &#x201C;a deal.&#x201D; The Achilles&#x2019; heel of international sanctions is Russia&#x2019;s ability to sell oil. Despite sanctions, many buyers still purchase Russian energy, providing the Kremlin with vital revenue to finance its war. With few exceptions, such as immobilizing Russian Central Bank assets, Western policymakers have moved cautiously with sanctions, particularly where they fear their decisions might roil commodity or energy markets. This restrained approach resembles the first part of the Monty Python fish-slapping dance: irritating the Kremlin but not delivering the decisive blow. Trump, however, seems eager to take on the second part: delivering the financial punch he believes will force Putin to strike a deal. A fisherman carries his belongings on a sled on the ice of the Gulf of Finland against the backdrop of the St. Petersburg Oil Terminal in St. Petersburg, Russia, on March 6, 2024. (Artem Priakhin/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Russia&#x2019;s reliance on oil exports is not just a weakness of international sanctions but also a critical vulnerability for the Kremlin. Without this revenue, the dire state of the Russian economy and its ability to fund its illegal war of aggression in Ukraine would become perilous. Trump recognizes this &#x2014; and sees an opportunity. Trump has already called on OPEC countries to reduce the price of oil, arguing that cheaper oil would end Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine &#x201C;immediately,&#x201D; further suggesting that OPEC countries&#x2019; decision to maintain high oil prices makes them &#x201C;to a certain extent responsible&#x201D; for the war. You can plainly see the seeds of a deal forming in the President&#x2019;s mind. Trump&#x2019;s Truth Social post hints that he is prepared to wield every economic tool at his disposal &#x2014; taxes, tariffs, and sanctions &#x2014; to target Russian oil sales. To date, there is little evidence that Russia has lost much of its oil market, beyond countries that are Ukraine&#x2019;s closest allies in the G7. Trump could launch a &#x201C;maximum pressure&#x201D; campaign aimed at cutting off these buyers. Observers may question where these nations would source their energy instead. Trump&#x2019;s answer? The United States, which is increasingly positioned as a major oil and gas exporter. By coercing countries to abandon Russian energy, Trump envisions boosting U.S. exports, simultaneously undermining the Kremlin and profiting the American economy. Trump prides himself on his deal-making skills. His worldview is driven by the need to coerce, cajole, and, if necessary, bully to achieve his goals. After three years of gentle and intermittent slapping of Russia by Western sanctions, the stage is set for the final sanctions push. The new occupant of the White House undoubtedly feels he is the man for the job and clearly believes that his love of economic tools and maximum pressure will indeed &#x201C;get the deal done.&#x201D; For Trump, peace and profit would surely be the ultimate deal.

Germany ramps up Russian LNG imports via EU ports, report says	Germany&apos;s imports of Russian liquified natural gas (LNG) via other EU countries continue to rise despite restrictions on direct shipments, the Financial Times wrote on Jan. 28, citing a report by Belgian, German, and Ukrainian NGOs. Following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Europe began to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels to avoid financing the Kremlin&#x2019;s war chest. Despite these efforts, Europe&apos;s imports of Russian LNG, which is largely not subject to sanctions, have soared to record levels in 2024. Germany&#x2019;s national energy company Sefe bought 58 cargoes of Russian LNG from the French port of Dunkirk in 2024, six times more than in 2023, according to the report. Sefe was owned by Russia&#x2019;s Gazprom until the former&#x2019;s forced nationalization in 2022 and has a contract with Russia&#x2019;s Russia&#x2019;s Yamal LNG, owned by Russia&apos;s largest LNG producer and the country&apos;s second-largest natural gas producer, Novatek. Belgium, Spain, and France receive Russian LNG cargos, which they later reexport to other countries, the FT reported. This makes it difficult to trace the origin and allows Germany to import Russian LNG even after banning its ports from receiving Russian LNG shipments. The report underscores complications in the EU&apos;s effort to reduce the reliance on Russian fossil fuels. The EU cut all Russian coal imports, most Russian oil imports, and over two-thirds of Russian gas imports to the EU, a Commission spokesperson said earlier in January. The EU aims to eliminate all Russian fossil fuels from its market by 2027.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-buying-russian-lng/	2025-01-28T03:39:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2147892507.jpg
Russia pressuring relatives of Ukrainian POWs to collaborate, officials say	Russian intelligence services and military are attempting to influence relatives of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) by contacting them immediately after their capture, the Ukrainian Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of POWs reported on Jan. 27. The calls are used to pressure relatives into cooperating with Russian forces by demanding money, sensitive information, or illegal actions in exchange for promises of better treatment or inclusion in prisoner exchanges, according to the statement. &quot;This is done to shock, emotionally pressure, and force the family to cooperate,&quot; the headquarters reported. This comes as another example of Russia abusing or threatening Ukrainian captives as part of its all-out war against Ukraine. Kyiv and Moscow have carried out several prisoner exchanges during the conflict, though Russia has been accused of deliberately slowing down the swaps and spreading disinformation about the process to destabilize Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities have documented widespread violations of the Geneva Conventions by Russia, including the execution of over 100 Ukrainian POWs in 2024 alone, according to Ukrainian Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets. Reports of torture, murder, and ill-treatment of Ukrainian captives have surged in recent months, particularly in Donetsk Oblast, where intense fighting continues. On Jan. 23, Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office announced it was investigating a case of Russian troops summarily executing six Ukrainian POWs in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-pressure-relatives-of-ukrainian-pows-to-cooperate-ukrainian-officials-report/	2025-01-28T03:05:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2146012439.jpg
Large amount of Russian military gear reportedly evacuated from Syria's Tartus port	A &quot;large amount&quot; of Russian military equipment vanished from the Syrian port of Tartus with the departure of the Russian cargo ship Sparta II, an investigative journalist at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Mark Krutov, said on Jan. 27, citing satellite images. Another Russian cargo ship called Sparta remained docked in the port after the two ships idled for weeks off the coast before being granted permission to dock, the BBC reported. The news sheds further light on the state of Russian military assets in Syria, whose ultimate fate remains unclear after a rebel offensive overthrew Moscow-backed dictator Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. &quot;A large amount of Russian military equipment vanished from the Syrian port of Tartus with Sparta II&#x2019;s departure, while Sparta vessel remains in port,&quot; Krutov&#x2019;s post on X read. Both ships are owned by the sanctioned shipping company Oboronlogistics. Russia&#x2019;s Stroytransgaz&#x2019;s commitment made in 2019 to invest over $500 million in the modernization of the port, a prerequisite for allowing Russian ships into the port, was recently canceled. A large amount of Russian military equipment vanished from the Syrian port of Tartus with Sparta II&#x2019;s departure, while Sparta vessel remains in port. The nearest loading area to the vessel has become densely packed with containers, as a @planet satellite image from Jan. 27 shows. pic.twitter.com/RHACg4ac3C Russia had a 49-year leasing right of the port, which had been agreed upon earlier by the Assad regime. After the dictator was overthrown and fled to Russia, Moscow began withdrawing military and naval assets from Syria. Russian soldiers and materiel began leaving the country mainly by planes, departing from another key Russian military base, the Khmeimim airport. This means that despite the impediments to maritime transport, most materiel is leaving the country via airlift, with only equipment impossible or expensive to lift by air being transported by sea, Russian military blogger Fighterbomber said in a Telegram post on Jan. 22. The BBC wrote that there were probably two more Russian warships in the port, the Ivan Gren and the Aleksandr Otrakovsky. This assessment was supported by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-evacuating-tartus/	2025-01-28T02:44:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192609037.jpg
Russian oligarch Abramovich evaded taxes through fake yacht hire scheme, media investigation says	Russian-Israeli oligarch Roman Abramovich evaded millions in taxes in EU countries through a fake yacht-for-hire scheme, according to a joint investigation by the BBC, The Guardian, and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism published on Jan. 28. The businessman acquired five yachts in the 2000s that he then &quot;hired&quot; for himself through controlled companies to claim an exemption from value-added tax (VAT) in Cyprus and elsewhere, the investigation said, citing leaked documents. Abramovich has a net worth estimated to be around $9 billion and has Russian, Israeli, and Portuguese citizenship. He was formerly the governor of the Chukotka region in Russia&apos;s far east and previously owned Chelsea FC, which he was forced to sell after the outbreak of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He and other top Russian oligarchs were sanctioned after the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The oligarch now resides alternatively in Tel Aviv, Istanbul, and Russia&apos;s Sochi. According to the investigation, Abramovich acquired the Eclipse, Ecstasea, Luna, Le Grand Bleu, and Pelorus superyachts shortly after getting rich from selling the Russian oil company Sibneft in 2005. The vessels, owned by various companies registered in the British Virgin Islands ultimately administered by Abramovich&apos;s trust, were registered as cargo, commercial, or passenger yachts and &quot;leased&quot; to the Cyprus-based company Blue Ocean Yacht Management. &#xA0; Blue Ocean then reportedly rented the yachts to other companies, which were, in fact, also controlled by Abramovich. This scheme helped the businessman generate profit without paying VAT. The oligarch&apos;s companies falsely claimed the right to tax exemption by listing the yachts as central to their business. According to experts consulted by the journalists, this may amount to tax evasion. Abramovich&apos;s lawyers denied any knowledge of a tax evasion scheme. The article came as part of the joint Cyprus Confidential investigation into files leaked in 2023 and led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and Paper Trail Media. Shortly after the outbreak of the full-scale invasion, Abramovich participated in peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. Bloomberg reported that he visited Kyiv as part of the talks in April 2022, which his spokesperson denied. Later in the year, Abramovich met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to help negotiate a prisoner exchange.	https://kyivindependent.com/abramovich-evaded-taxes-through-fake-yacht-hire-scheme-media-investigation-says/	2025-01-28T02:12:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-521573236.jpg
Stupid, illogical' — Zelensky blasts Ukraine for relinquishing nuclear arms without strong security guarantees	President Volodymyr Zelensky on Jan. 25 criticized Ukraine&apos;s decision to give up its nuclear weapons in the 1990s without receiving strong security guarantees in return. Ukraine relinquished the Soviet-era nuclear arms stationed on its territory under the Budapest Memorandum signed in 1994. The deal saw Kyiv join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and receive security guarantees from great powers, namely the U.S., the U.K., and Russia. &quot;In my opinion, it should not have been done, based on the fact that we were attacked,&quot; Zelensky said in an interview with the Italian newspaper Il Foglio released on Jan. 27. Twenty years after signing the agreement, Russia launched a war against Ukraine, occupying Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine. Thirty years in, Russia is now actively conducting a full-scale offensive against Ukraine. &quot;It was necessary to exchange (nuclear arms) for real security guarantees, and at the time, that was only NATO. And to be honest, today, it is only NATO,&quot; Zelensky said. The Ukrainian president commented that Ukraine agreed to give up on nuclear arms under pressure from &quot;larger economies&quot; like the U.S. and Russia. Despite this, Ukraine should have refused at the time, he added. &quot;If I were to exchange nuclear weapons, I would exchange them for something very strong that can actually stop any aggressor, regardless of its greatness, its territory, its army. And this would be a strong army and... a security bloc,&quot; Zelensky noted. &quot;Therefore, I believe that it was stupid, absolutely stupid, and illogical.&quot; This echoes Zelensky&apos;s comments from earlier this month when he said that those behind the agreement should be &quot;jailed.&quot; The outbreak of the full-scale invasion sparked discussions on whether Ukraine should again develop new nuclear weapons as a deterrent against Russian aggression. The Ukrainian leadership denied any such plans and said that NATO membership is the best possible security guarantee. Ukraine has applied to join NATO at the outbreak of the full-scale invasion in 2022 but is yet to receive an official invitation. Despite an allied pledge from last year that Kyiv&apos;s path toward membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; Zelensky pointed to continued resistance to Ukraine&apos;s entry from countries like the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia. As U.S. Donald Trump pushes for negotiations to end the war this year, Russia said that a full ban on Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession is one of its key demands for resolving the conflict.	https://kyivindependent.com/stupid-illogical-zelensky-blasts-ukraine-relinquishing-nuclear-arms-without-strong-security-guarantees/	2025-01-28T00:50:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1850432035.jpg
US suspends Ukrainian refugee program after Trump's immigration order	The U.S. has suspended its refugee program for Ukrainians called &quot;Uniting for Ukraine,&quot; the country&apos;s Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website showed on Jan. 28, more than a week after U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order on immigration and border security. &quot;Due to the Jan. 20, 2025, Executive Order, Securing Our Borders, USCIS is pausing acceptance of Form I-134A, Online Request to be a Supporter and Declaration of Financial Support, until we review all categorical parole processes as required by that order,&quot; the statement read. This means that new applications are effectively frozen until the completion of a review. The Uniting for Ukraine program allowed Ukrainians to stay in the U.S. for up to two years, work, and receive health insurance. The applicants were obligated to have a sponsor in the U.S. who would financially support them during their stay. As of last year, the U.S. had accepted over 200,000 Ukrainians under the program. Over 6 million Ukrainian citizens have fled their homes in the wake of Russia&apos;s all-out invasion in 2022. The decision was widely anticipated after the U.S. Homeland Security Department suspended several programs that allowed immigrants to temporarily settle in the country. According to a directive seen by the New York Times, this included an initiative for Ukrainians. The order called for an immediate halt to &quot;final decisions&quot; on applications related to these programs while the administration reviewed them and decided whether to terminate them. This decision will block the entry of immigrants fleeing some of the most unstable places in the world, including Ukraine, Cuba, Haiti, and Venezuela, among others, according to the outlet. The Trump administration officials also said that Trump believes that many of these programs were &quot;never lawful to begin with.&quot; In a similar move, the U.S. State Department has suspended almost all foreign aid, including non-military assistance to Ukraine. The step threw Ukrainian NGOs, many reliant on U.S. support, into disarray, with some voicing concerns about their ability to survive the aid freeze.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-suspends-ukrainian-refugee-program-after-trumps-immigration-order/	2025-01-27T23:59:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1246719268.jpg

G7 ambassadors urge swift resolution of Defense Procurement Agency's leadership dispute	Ambassadors of the Group of Seven (G7) countries called for a swift resolution of the Defense Procurement Agency dispute and urged uninterrupted continuation of weapons procurement, according to their statement on Jan. 27. This comes after Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Jan. 24 that he would not renew the contract of Maryna Bezrukova, the head of the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA), the body in charge of buying weapons for the Ukrainian military. He cited unsatisfactory results as the reason. Umerov&#x2019;s decision was just days after the DPA&#x2019;s supervisory board voted to extend the contract with Bezrukova after a year of reforming in this role. The ambassadors also emphasized the importance of adhering to governance standards. &quot;Consistency with good governance principles and NATO recommendations is important to maintain the trust of the public and international partners,&quot; they said in a statement on X. Umerov had earlier criticized the DPA under Bezrukova&#x2019;s leadership, claiming that arms procurement had &quot;turned into an Amazon.&quot; Bezrukova told the Kyiv Independent that she would not leave the agency as she was legally selected by the DPA&#x2019;s supervisory board. &#x201C;I&apos;m not going to surrender. I will stand in my position until the end,&#x201D; she said. She also pointed out that procurement for Ukrainian forces could be blocked due to the ongoing conflict. &quot;Contracting and supplies may be blocked because we are in a legal conflict. I cannot perform my duties now because of certain registration procedures,&quot; Bezrukova told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Bezrukova added that it is difficult to predict the consequences of the minister&apos;s decision and called the situation &quot;a serious reputational loss&quot; that could negatively affect relations with Ukraine&apos;s foreign partners. Umerov plans to replace Bezrukova with Arsen Zhumadilov, the director of the State Rear Operator (known under its Ukrainian acronym DOT) which buys food and clothes for the military.	https://kyivindependent.com/g7-ambassadors-urge-swift-resolution-of-defense-procurement-agencys-leadership-dispute/	2025-01-27T21:58:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1648100666-1.webp
Justice Ministry seeks to confiscate Russian oil company Tatneft's assets in Ukraine	The Justice Ministry has requested the Supreme Anti-Corruption Court to confiscate the assets of the Russian oil company Tatneft in Ukraine, Deputy Minister Iryna Bogatyk announced on Jan. 27. Tatneft is valued at approximately 2 billion hryvnia ($47 million). The assets targeted for nationalization include corporate rights, gas stations, oil depots, vehicles, and equipment located in the Kharkiv and Poltava Oblasts. The oil company is Russian state-controlled and significantly contributes to the country&apos;s budget. Tatneft regularly supplies products to enterprises within the Russian military-industrial complex. &#x201C;It (Tatneft) is part of the structure of the fuel and energy complex of the Russian Federation and produces about 20 types of products, including aviation kerosene and diesel fuel, which are included in the mandatory list of recommended supply to enterprises of the military-industrial complex of Russia,&#x201D; Bogatyk wrote on Facebook. The Ministry of Justice has also filed lawsuits to confiscate the sanctioned assets of three Ukrainians, including properties, vehicles, and corporate shares belonging to Kyrylo Vyshynsky, Oleksandr Kuzmenko, and Vladimir Sergiyenko. Russia&#x2019;s oil industry has been critical to the country&#x2019;s war efforts.

During the session with top European officials, including Costa, Zelensky discussed a variety of topics, including additional sanctions as well as the supply of additional ammunition, the Presidential Office said. &quot;We need to continue putting pressure on (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, and sanctions are one of the truly powerful tools,&quot; Zelensky said. Earlier in the day, European Union foreign ministers approved the extension of sanctions against Russia for another six months. According to the read out of the meeting, the anticipated 16th EU sanctions package was &quot;one of the key topics of the meeting.&quot; The Council of the EU adopted on Dec. 16 its 15th package of sanctions against Russia, targeting the Russian shadow fleet of tankers and the military-industrial complex. In addition to sanctions, the leaders discussed the details of a new ammunition supply initiative, with additional informal meetings scheduled for Feb. 3. Later in the day, Zelensky met with Macron to discuss &quot;security cooperation&quot; amid anticipated peace negotiations in the coming months. Macron has reportedly spearheaded prospects of sending European peacekeeping forces to Ukraine, amid U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s commitment to &quot;end&quot; the war. No details were provided on the specifics of the discussions between Zelensky and Macron, although the Presidential Office read out notes that &quot;possible formats for security guarantees for Ukraine&quot; were discussed. Earlier in the day, Zelensky expressed to Costa and European officials the need for a &quot;just and lasting peace&quot; following peace negotiations, echoing previous statements on Europe&apos;s full participation in peace negotiation. &quot;We will stand with you for as long as it takes,&quot; Costa concluded. Russia has thus far opposed the presence of NATO peacekeepers in Ukraine, with Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova claiming on Jan. 24 that it could lead to &quot;uncontrolled escalation.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-with-macron-european-council-president-in-poland/	2025-01-27T17:54:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1254902059.jpg
Russia's Ryazan oil refinery suspends operations after drone strike, Reuters reports	The Ryazan Oil Refinery in Russia has suspended operations due to damage from Ukrainian drone attacks, Reuters reported on Jan. 27, citing two industry sources. Ukraine confirmed hitting the plant in an overnight drone strike on Jan. 24. Oil storage facilities caught fire during the attack, sources told Reuters. The strike damaged a railway loading track and a hydroeater unit, which removes impurities from refined products. &quot;The railway loading equipment has been damaged. There have been no railways loadings, they stopped oil processing,&quot; one source said. Another said the facility suspended all loadings since Jan. 24. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces (SOS) launched a joint attack against the refinery on Jan. 24. An SBU source told the Kyiv Independent that the strike caused fires at three oil depots and a workshop. Local residents reported another attack on the plant two nights later, circulating footage of explosions and fires at the site. The Kyiv Independent could not confirm whether the images depicted a new attack or the previous strike. The Ryazan Oil Refinery, one of Russia&apos;s largest, has the capacity to process 17 million metric tons of oil per year. According to Reuters, the facility accounted for nearly 5% of Russia&apos;s total refining in 2024. Kyiv considers oil refineries to be valid military targets, as profits from the fossil fuel industry fund Russia&apos;s war machine. Ukraine previously attacked the Ryazan refinery in May 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-ryazan-oil-refinery-suspends-operations-after-drone-strike-reuters-reports/	2025-01-27T15:33:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/ryazan.jpg
A farce' — Foreign Ministry condemns sham election in Belarus	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry condemned the recent presidential election in Belarus, calling the vote &quot;a farce&quot; in a statement issued Jan. 27. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko &quot;won&quot; a seventh consecutive term as president on Jan. 26 in a so-called election widely denounced as neither free nor fair by the international community. &quot;It is difficult to call such elections fair, transparent and democratic, in particular given the political repression in Belarus, which deprived voters of any alternative choice and turned the elections themselves into a one-man political show,&quot; the ministry&apos;s statement read. Elections under the repressive conditions of the Lukashenko regime &quot;cannot be legitimate,&quot; the ministry said. &quot;It is a farce.&quot; Lukashenko has ruled Belarus since 1994 and is Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s closest ally. The Belarusian leader competed for the presidency against regime-approved candidates Sergey Syrankov, who secured 3.21% of the vote, and Oleg Gaidukevich, who received 2%. Lukashenko was declared the winner with 86.82% of the vote, while 3.6% of ballots reportedly voted &quot;against all.&quot; Kaja Kallas, the EU&apos;s chief diplomat, called the vote &quot;a sham&quot; and &quot;an affront to democracy.&quot; Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said the election was nothing more than a &quot;special operation&quot; by the Russia-backed regime. Tsikhanouskaya contested the results of the country&apos;s 2020 election, sparking mass protests after Lukashenko declared victory despite evidence of widespread fraud. The government brutally repressed the demonstrations and detained thousands of political prisoners. The Foreign Ministry expressed solidarity with Belarusian opposition figures and encouraged them to continue to fight for an independent Belarus. &quot;We are convinced that a democratic and sovereign Belarus, in which the people, not one person, will determine the future, will be a factor of long-term stability in our region, and not an accomplice in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine,&quot; the ministry said.	https://kyivindependent.com/a-farce-foreign-ministry-condemns-sham-elections-in-belarus/	2025-01-27T14:22:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1257867913.jpg
Trump 'helped' persuade Hungary to unblock EU Russia sanctions, Polish FM claims	U.S. President Donald Trump may have helped persuade Hungary to lift its veto on the European Union&apos;s extension of sanctions against Russia, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said on Jan. 27, according to the Polish news outlet RMF 24. The EU foreign ministers approved a six-month extension of its sanctions against Russia on Jan. 27 after Hungary withdrew its veto. Sikorski believes Trump&apos;s recent threats of sanctions against Moscow played a role in Hungary&apos;s decision. &quot;I think that President Trump helped here,&quot; Sikorski said. The EU sanctions, imposed on Russia in response to the full-scale invasion of &#xA0;Ukraine, must be extended by unanimous vote every six months. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban blocked the extension in a surprise veto on Dec. 19 and said he would not reconsider extending the sanctions until Trump took office. Orban is a close ally of Trump, who hosted the Hungarian prime minister at his Florida residence on Dec. 9. During the first week of his second term as president, Trump threatened to impose sanctions and tariffs against Russia if Russian President Vladimir Putin does not agree to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. &quot;We can do it the easy way or the hard way,&quot; Trump said. Hungary also previously said it would not extend the sanctions until Ukraine resumes the transit of Russian gas through its territory. Ahead of the Jan. 27 vote, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Brussels had provided the &quot;requested guarantees&quot; on energy security. Orban, one of the most Kremlin-friendly leaders in the EU, has consistently obstructed and delayed sanctions against Russia and military support for Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-helped-persuade-hungary-to-unblock-eu-russia-sanctions-polish-fm-claims/	2025-01-27T13:51:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/sikorski.jpeg
If half the people go home tomorrow, Putin will kill us all' — Zelensky defends mobilization	President Volodymyr Zelensky defended Ukraine&apos;s mobilization efforts in an interview with &#xA0;the Italian news outlet Il Foglio on Jan. 25, saying that the quickest way to bring soldiers home was to mobilize enough servicemembers to force Russia to end the war. Ukraine has struggled with manpower issues throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. An updated mobilization law passed in April 2024 aimed to address these difficulties, simplifying the process for identifying eligible conscripts and introducing penalties for draft dodgers. Mobilization slowed last autumn despite the legislative reforms, leaving depleted front-line units to face Russia&apos;s eastern advance. &quot;(M)artial law, it provides for the mobilization of people, and all the resources that are in the country. Absolutely everyone,&quot; Zelensky said in a video of the interview published by the Presidential Office on Jan. 27. &quot;And that, unfortunately, is the challenge of this war, and why we need to maximize the speed to end it. To force Russia to end this war.&quot; Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 are barred from leaving the country under martial law, but only those over 25 are eligible for the draft. The government is currently finalizing reforms to recruit 18- to 25-year-olds, aiming to make voluntary enlistment more appealing to younger citizens. &quot;We are defending ourselves today,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;If tomorrow, for example, half of the army just goes home, then we should have surrendered on the first day. That&apos;s the way it is. Because if half the people go home tomorrow, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will kill us all.&quot; While Zelensky said the best way to bring soldiers home was to force Russia to end the war, he acknowledged that the Armed Forces require better policies on rotating and relieving personnel. &quot;They have rotations, or vacations. But certainly it is not enough,&quot; he said. &quot;Certainly we need to work on the quality of that.&quot; Russian forces significantly outnumber Ukrainian units in some parts of the front and have been able to gain territory in eastern Ukraine while absorbing heavy losses. Ukrainian authorities have faced criticism for aggressive forced mobilization tactics and for reportedly transferring skilled Air Force personnel into infantry units. At the same time, Zelensky has refused to lower the draft age to 18 despite increasing U.S. pressure to do so. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/if-half-the-people-go-home-tomorrow-putin-will-kill-us-all-zelensky-defends-mobilization/	2025-01-27T12:54:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Ze2.png
Ukraine war latest: North Korean forces reportedly pull back from one front-line sector following heavy casualties	Key developments on Jan. 27: North Korean soldiers appear to have temporarily withdrawn from one of the axes of the front in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, a Special Operations Forces (SOF) spokesperson told the Kyiv Independent on Jan. 27 as Pyongyang&#x2019;s troops reportedly suffered significant losses. The statement came after Sky News reported, citing a commander of a detachment of the 73rd Naval Special Operations Center with a callsign &quot;Puls,&quot; that North Korean troops have temporarily withdrawn from the contact line in the embattled Russian region. Colonel Oleksandr Kindratenko, a spokesperson of the Special Operations Forces, clarified to the Kyiv Independent that the North Korean troops appear to have had to temporarily withdraw only from one of the axes of Kursk Oblast where the 73rd SOF Center is deployed. North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in early August 2024. Ukrainian forces have continued fighting in the region, hoping to leverage their positions for potential negotiations. North Korean forces are taking respite from hostilities, presumably to treat the wounded, wait for reinforcements, and work on mistakes made during the fighting in this sector, according to Sky News. &quot;Puls&quot; assumed that this break will not last long and the North Korean military &quot;will be back soon.&quot; The soldier also noted North Korean troops&apos; high motivation and that they continued the offensive despite heavy losses. North Korean soldiers were unaware of the threats from drones and artillery and attacked on foot in large groups, &quot;like in World War II,&quot; becoming an easy target, &quot;Puls&quot; added. There is poor coordination and a language barrier between North Korean and Russian troops barrier that has already led to North Korean soldiers targeting Russian positions, according to the Ukrainian military. South Korean intelligence announced at the end of January that Pyongyang was planning to send more troops to Russia to participate in the war. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, also said previously that Pyongyang is preparing reinforcements, mainly gun and rocket artillery units. The New York Times reported that according to an undisclosed U.S. official, fresh North Korean troops could arrive within two months. Russia&#x2019;s Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 26 that its forces had captured Velyka Novosilka, a strategically significant settlement in the western part of Donetsk Oblast. Ukraine&#x2019;s 110th Mechanized Brigade, which is deployed in the area, acknowledged a withdrawal from parts of the village to avoid encirclement but claimed that fighting is ongoing elsewhere in Velyka Novosilka. &quot;Fights in Velyka Novosilka are ongoing. Russian forces shelled our positions 30 times,&quot; the Khortytsia group of forces said on Jan. 27. &quot;The Defense Forces continue inflicting casualties on Russia in manpower and equipment during tense battles.&quot; The group&#x2019;s spokesperson, Viktor Trehubov, clarified later during the day that Ukrainian forces withdrew from the southern part of the village but continue to hold positions in the outskirts. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The village with a pre-war population of 5,000 lies only around 15 kilometers from the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast and 20 kilometers from Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a region so far untouched by Russian occupation. The estimated Russian advance at Velyka Novosilka, Donetsk Oblast, as of Jan. 26, 2025, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)If confirmed, this would represent the most significant gain of Russian forces in Donetsk Oblast since overrunning Kurakhove earlier in January. The 110th Brigade said that both Russia and Ukraine had parity in equipment but Moscow had significant advantage in manpower. According to the Ukrainian military, Russian forces will struggle to advance their offensive onward. The Mokri Yaly River creates an obstacle for Russia&#x2019;s advance and Russian troops are in a vulnerable &quot;fire pocket,&quot; said the brigade. Fighting is at a very heavy level in Donetsk Oblast and Russian troops continue to advance, albeit slowly, this year. &#x200B;&#x200B;Throughout the fall of 2024, Russian forces made operational gains in southern Donetsk Oblast, including areas near Toretsk and Chasiv Yar, while advancing near Kupiansk and on Russian soil in Kursk Oblast. Russian forces have intensified their assaults near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, deploying small groups in an attempt to encircle Ukrainian troops, Victor Trehubov, spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces, said on Jan. 27 on national television. &quot;For the first time, they started to fight smart; for the first time, they started to fight not just with direct human waves, but with attempts to cover, with attempts to bypass a large city and force Ukrainian forces to leave it,&quot; Trehubov said. The area near Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub for Ukrainian forces, has been at the center of heavy fighting for months. &quot;The situation is as follows: there is a large number of small-scale clashes near Pokrovsk because Russians are trying to enter and surround Pokrovsk from the west in small groups. There are many, many clashes there,&quot; Trehubov said. The estimated Russian advance in the Pokrovsk sector in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 27, 2025, according to DeepState map. A white symbol marks Pokrovsk. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Pokrovsk remains the focal point of Russia&apos;s eastern offensive, now in its fifth month. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported that Russian troops are continuing to push on multiple axes, including Lyman, Siversk, Kramatorsk, Toretsk, and Kurakhove. Trehubov said the Russian command is avoiding urban battles to reduce heavy personnel losses. Despite these efforts, Moscow has so far failed to outflank Pokrovsk and sever its logistics routes. President Volodymyr Zelensky appointed Major General Mykhailo Drapatyi, Commander of the Ground Forces of Ukraine, as the head of the Khortytsia operational-strategic Group on Jan. 26. &quot;Today, I ordered a strengthening of the command structure of our forces in the Donetsk Oblast,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address. He noted that Drapatyi&#x2019;s leadership will focus on the most intense combat areas while also ensuring proper training for brigades. Drapatyi will continue in his role as Commander of the Ground Forces, the largest component of the Armed Forces. Zelensky appointed Drapatyi as commander in November 2024. Drapatyi served as a commander of Ukraine&apos;s 58th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade from 2016 to 2019. He also played one of the key roles in the liberation of Mariupol in Donetsk Oblast in 2014. Additionally, Brigadier General Andrii Hnatov has been appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff to improve coordination between operational headquarters and the front lines. Previously, Hnatov served as Commander of the Joint Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Zelensky appointed him to that role in June 2024. Zelensky said that these and other changes were discussed with Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi to address key military tasks at all levels. &#x201C;The specific needs of the front must determine the standards for equipping and training brigades,&#x201D; Zelensky said. Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence (HUR) denied on Jan. 27 media reports that its head, Kyrylo Budanov, predicted serious consequences for the existence of Ukraine unless negotiations begin by the summer during a confidential parliamentary meeting. Although HUR&#x2019;s statement did not specify the alleged quote, an assessment attributed to Budanov began circulating in the Ukrainian media earlier on Jan. 27. &quot;If there are no serious negotiations by the summer, then very dangerous processes for the very existence of Ukraine may begin,&quot; an undisclosed source told Ukrainska Pravda, referring to an alleged statement by Budanov during a closed-door parliamentary meeting. &quot;The Ukrainian military intelligence would like to draw the attention&#x2026; to the fact that the alleged quote of (Budanov)... from a closed, classified session of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine&#x2026; is not true,&quot; HUR&#x2019;s statement read. Ukrainska Pravda did not specify what processes the military spy chief was said to have in mind. In office since 2020, Budanov has at time made radical predictions about the full-scale war that have not always come true. Opposition lawmaker Oleksii Honcharenko also disputed Ukrainska Pravda&#x2019;s article, saying the spy chief did not warn of threats to Ukraine&#x2019;s very existence. &quot;(Budanov) said that if nothing changes, the front line may begin to collapse and there will be problems,&quot; Honcharenko said on his Telegram channel. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The news comes amid growing expectation of peace talks as U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table. Short on manpower, Kyiv will soon begin the fourth year of the full-scale war on its back foot, with Russia holding or pushing the front line on key directions such as the southwestern edge of Donetsk Oblast or Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. Trump&#x2019;s special peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, said the U.S. aims to end the war in the first 100 days of Trump&#x2019;s presidency. European Union foreign ministers approved the extension of sanctions against Russia for another six months on Jan. 27, the EU&#x2019;s chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, announced on X. &quot;Europe delivers: EU foreign ministers just agreed to extend again the sanctions on Russia. This will continue to deprive Moscow of revenues to finance its war. Russia needs to pay for the damage they are causing,&quot; Kallas wrote on X. Hungary&#x2019;s Prime Minister Viktor Orban has threatened to veto the extension until Ukraine resumes the transit of Russian gas through its territory. The announcement by Kallas comes after Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Brussels had provided the &quot;requested guarantees&quot; on energy security. &quot;The European Commission is committed to protecting natural gas and oil pipelines leading to European Union member states,&quot; the Hungarian chief diplomat said, adding that the European Commission will also ask Kyiv to maintain the oil transit through its territory. Ukraine terminated Russian natural gas transit through its territory on Jan. 1. Kyiv has repeatedly warned that it would not extend the agreement when it expires at the end of 2024 because it did not want to finance Russia&apos;s war. The end of transit led to a spat between Kyiv on one side and Hungary and Slovakia on the other, with the two latter countries complaining the decision endangers their energy security. Ukraine continues to transit Russian oil, though a bill on banning the transit has been registered in the parliament. The EU has imposed 15 sanctions packages against Russia, which include restrictions on individuals and legal entities. The limitations also targeted Russia&#x2019;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of oil tankers and froze Russian assets, among other moves. In January, the European Commission launched consultations on the 16th package of sanctions against Russia. The restrictions are expected to apply to imports of aluminum, agricultural products, the &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; liquefied natural gas (LNG), and Russian banks, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-north-korean-troops-seem-to-temporarily-withdraw-from-one-section-of-front-in-kursk-oblast-military-says/	2025-01-27T12:25:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029588238--1-.jpg
Trump suspends aid to Ukraine, vital NGOs 'don't know if they'll survive'	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s decision to freeze foreign development assistance for 90 days has thrown Ukrainian organizations into turmoil, in some cases threatening their very existence and leaving the people they support in limbo. These non-profit organizations provide a huge range of humanitarian services, including counseling, organizing cultural events, and providing basic services, often to some of the most vulnerable segments of society. &quot;Honestly, we still don&#x2019;t fully understand the scope of the impact this decision will have on the civic sector and everyone affected,&quot; Olha Kucher, head of the services department at Veteran Hub, an NGO that supports Ukrainian soldiers, war veterans, and their families, told the Kyiv Independent on Jan 27. &quot;The civic sector plays a massive role in supporting veterans and their families, particularly through psychosocial services, as we do.&quot; One of Trump&apos;s first actions upon entering the White House was to sign an executive order freezing foreign development assistance for 90 days to conduct a review and ensure it aligns with the new administration&apos;s policies. The wording of the executive order was broad, making no distinction between humanitarian and military aid, and no mention of any exemptions. Veteran Hub, an NGO supporting Ukrainian soldiers, war veterans, and their families in Kyiv, Ukraine. (Veteran Hub / Facebook)Ukrainian Veterans at Veteran Hub, an NGO supporting Ukrainian soldiers, war veterans, and their families in Kyiv, Ukraine. (Veteran Hub / Facebook)The Pentagon clarified on Jan. 23 that relating to Ukraine, the directive &quot;only applies to development programs, not military support.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 25 that the U.S. aid had not stopped flowing to Ukraine. But any relief that crucial U.S. weapons would still be sent to Ukraine was tempered by the prospect of a pause in humanitarian aid. This was compounded a day later when U.S. State Secretary Marco Rubio issued &quot;stop-work orders&quot; on nearly all existing foreign assistance grants. The orders were effective immediately. &quot;State just totally went nuclear on foreign assistance,&quot; one unnamed State Department official told Politico. As a result, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) was ordered to stop projects in Ukraine. Affected organizations were notified of the decision on the morning of Jan. 25. Ukraine currently tops the recipient list of U.S. development assistance as it continues to face Russia&#x2019;s war, official data shows. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, USAID has provided Ukraine with $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support. At a stroke, organizations in Ukraine have been left in dire financial straits. One of them is &#x201C;Cukr,&#x201D; an NGO and media outlet based in Sumy, a city in northeastern Ukraine located just 30 kilometers from the Russian border that has been heavily affected by the war. &quot;If we lose all of our U.S. funding, we won&#x2019;t last 90 days without additional support,&quot; Dmytro Tishchenko, Cukr co-founder, told the Kyiv Independent. As well as being a media channel, Cukr (which means &#x201C;sugar&#x201D; in Ukrainian, with a tweak) organizes concerts and festivals, and also provides educational workshops on business and mental health, badly-needed resources for those living in a region that is one of the hardest hit by daily Russian missile, glide bomb, and drone attacks. Magazines of &#x201C;Cukr,&#x201D; an NGO and media outlet based in Sumy, a northeastern Ukrainian city situated just 30 kilometers from the Russian border, which has been severely impacted by the war. (Cukr / Facebook)Tishchenko said 30% of the organization&apos;s funding was currently frozen and all planned events tied to that money had been canceled. &quot;Even if we try to use alternative resources for these projects, we&#x2019;ll need to rethink how to implement them,&quot; he said. Valerii Garmash, head of &quot;Makes Sense,&quot; an NGO dedicated to developing independent journalism in Ukraine, told the Kyiv Independent that the USAID freeze, even if lifted after 90 days, threatens the survival of her organization and others like it. &quot;A large number of organizations will simply cease to exist, they don&#x2019;t know how they are supposed to survive.&quot; she said, adding: &quot;Great organizations, valuable organizations, important organizations. But they really could, and theoretically might, just stop existing.&quot; Garmash said the USAID freeze will have an &quot;enormous impact&quot; on the work of Makes Sense, potentially threatening a hub it operates in Sloviansk, a city in embattled Donetsk Oblast, that supports journalists heading to report from the front lines. &quot;It would mean we simply wouldn&#x2019;t be able to support them, provide them with bulletproof vests, helmets, medical kits, give them a place to work, charge their equipment, or even just have coffee in a warm space,&quot; she said. As well as the precarious financial situation now facing the NGOs, individuals working from them have lost their jobs, at least temporarily. The head of a regional office for a State Department-funded organization in Ukraine spoke with the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity due to the fear of retaliation for speaking out. He said that the organization has projects funded by USAID that involve Ukrainian contractors. Due to the freeze, they will lose income from these projects. &quot;I explained the situation to them, and, you know, they&apos;re part-time contractors, this might not be their only livelihood, but for some people, it will be,&quot; he said.

(Volodymyr Tarasov / Ukrinform / Getty Images)&quot;Three months can be a very long time, and if they can&apos;t pay their rent, or something like that, that&apos;s the situation that these people can be in,&quot; he added. Hopes had been raised that Ukraine could be made exempt from the USAID freeze on Jan. 25, when the Financial Times (FT) reported that senior diplomats in the State Department&#x2019;s Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs requested a full waiver for operations in Ukraine, citing national security concerns. This had gone unheeded a day later when a U.S. State Department press release said Rubio had &quot;paused all U.S. foreign assistance funded by or through the State Department and USAID for review.&quot; But an American working for a State Department-funded organization in Ukraine told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity that the waiver could still be being processed. &quot;It&apos;s unlikely that they would have received an answer by now. I mean, it&apos;s only Monday,&quot; they said, adding &quot;I don&apos;t think any waivers would have been processed in time. It&apos;s possible that a waiver for Ukraine could still happen.&quot; The Kyiv Independent contacted USAID about the status of the waiver request but had not received a reply at the time of publication. In any case, until either the 90 days are up and USAID assistance resumes or the waiver request is approved, some of the most vulnerable people in Ukraine will be left without crucial support. Kucher, head of the services department at Veterans Hub, says that as well as providing in-person counseling and support to veterans, the organization&#x2019;s 24-hour support hotline handles 1,300 calls a month. &quot;For veterans and their families, knowing that there&#x2019;s someone they can rely on at any time is critical,&quot; she said. &quot;Any change, especially in uncertain times like these, is challenging for everyone. It&#x2019;s unpredictable and unsettling.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-suspends-aid-to-ukraine-vital-ngos-dont-know-if-theyll-survive/	2025-01-27T11:51:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194418223.jpg
Russia approves conscription reforms to target draft evaders, streamline recruitment	The Russian government has approved new measures to streamline the conscription process, making it easier to draft young men into the Armed Forces, including those who previously evaded service, The Moscow Times reported on Jan. 27. The reforms, according to Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kartapolov, aim to &quot;qualitatively improve the level of organization of conscription.&quot; Under the new legislation, draft board decisions for individuals deemed fit for service will remain valid for one year. This allows military commissions to send individuals to the army in subsequent drafts without requiring additional medical examinations or decisions. For instance, if a person was found fit but did not enter service due to illness or other reasons, they can be drafted directly during the next conscription campaign. In Russia, conscription campaigns are held twice a year, in spring and fall, targeting men aged 18 to 27. These campaigns form the core of Russia&apos;s conscription-based military system, drafting hundreds of thousands annually. The bill also consolidates the organization of draft commissions, mandating only one commission in cities of federal significance or two in larger municipalities. These changes follow Russia&apos;s recent conscription campaigns, during which record numbers were drafted. In the fall 2024 draft, 133,000 individuals were conscripted, and 150,000 were recruited during the spring campaign, a record for the past eight years. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed decrees specifying the number of recruits required during each period. The push to expand military manpower comes as Russia faces severe losses in its war against Ukraine. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 27 that Russia has lost 831,620 troops since launching its full-scale invasion. While Russian conscripts rarely take part in active combat, Russia has been actively recruiting civilians to take part in the country&apos;s war against Ukraine by offering financial incentives, pardoning crimes, or simply taking people from the streets. Yet, after the highly unpopular September 2022 mobilization led to over 261,000 Russians fleeing the country, Putin has avoided a second wave of mobilization, opting for alternative methods to bolster troop numbers.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-introduces-reforms-to-streamline-military-conscription-media-reports/	2025-01-27T11:36:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1253226504.jpg
After Lukashenko's latest sham election win, exiled Belarusians reflect on lessons learned from 2020's lost revolution	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko declared himself the winner in the country&apos;s so-called presidential elections, in which zero members of the country&apos;s opposition were allowed to take part. According to the country&apos;s authorities, Lukashenko secured 86.82% of the vote and became president for the seventh consecutive time. Despite international condemnation and widespread opposition among Belarusians, Lukashenko&apos;s regime has only tightened its control since the last election. Relentless crackdowns on dissent, including mass arrests, imprisonment, and torture, have been ongoing in the country for nearly five years. &quot;Anyone following the situation knows it&apos;s a sham election, and for us, Lukashenko has been wholly illegitimate since 2020,&quot; Hanna Komar, a Belarusian author who has been living in exile for the past five years, told the Kyiv Independent. Exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, widely recognized by election observers as the rightful winner of the 2020 presidential election, publicly condemned the latest so-called vote. &quot;Lukashenko, propped up by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, holds nine million Belarusians hostage, drags us into war, and betrays our sovereignty. We will never accept him. He does not represent Belarus. The regime must end its repressions, release political prisoners, and be held accountable for its crimes,&quot; Tsikhanouskaya wrote on Jan. 26.

(Pavel Byrkin / Sputnik / AFP via Getty Images)For the more than 500,000 Belarusians who have fled the country since 2020, Lukashenko&apos;s latest &quot;victory&quot; serves as a painful reminder of the democratic future they fought for and ultimately failed to secure. Yet, even in the face of despair, many try to remain hopeful, using the hard-earned lessons of that tumultuous period to strengthen their exile community and continue working toward a future democratic Belarus that they still dream of having. The 2020 presidential election in Belarus was defined by Tsikhanouskaya&apos;s bold challenge to Alexander Lukashenko&apos;s decades-long rule. By contrast, the latest so-called election lacked any real opposition, featuring three candidates from pro-government parties and one candidate seen as a figurehead. In the months leading up to Jan. 26, Lukashenko staged an orchestrated spectacle by pardoning and releasing dozens of political prisoners. Lukashenko framed the move as an act of goodwill toward those who had &quot;gone astray.&quot; However, these individuals had been imprisoned solely for exercising their democratic rights and taking part in the protests against Lukashenko&apos;s regime that began in May 2020. As of December 2024, at least 1,265 political prisoners are known to be held in Belarusian prisons, according to the Belarusian human rights organization Viasna. In December alone, up to 150 politically motivated sentences were handed down, with Belarusians consistently denied the right to a fair trial. &quot;I think Lukashenko understands that Russia is waiting for the right moment to replace him. He&apos;s deeply afraid of this and is now trying to play some kind of strange game with the West. He released some political prisoners to garner a &apos;favorable&apos; image, but at the same time, he hasn&apos;t stopped the repressions. It&apos;s endless,&quot; Kseniya Halubovich, an exiled film director and journalist, told the Kyiv Independent. Komar was among those detained during the 2020 protests, having attended a rally organized in solidarity with opposition leader Maria Kalesnikava, who had been arrested just days prior.

(STRINGER / AFP via Getty Images)The rally escalated when the women protesters tried to prevent the police from arresting the men. Komar spent nine days in jail and, by her own account, considers herself lucky to have been released. &quot;It was still a relatively mild phase of the political crackdowns back then. I am one of over 50,000 Belarusians who have endured detentions and imprisonment,&quot; Komar said. &quot;Since then, repression (against pro-democracy Belarusians) has only intensified. Every day, hundreds of people lose their jobs, face home searches, are summoned for interrogations, or are sentenced to days, weeks, months, and even years in prison. The punishment machine has not ceased for a single day since the summer of 2020.&quot; Opposition leader Kalesnikava has been behind bars for over four years, as are those who attempted to challenge Lukahsenko on the ballot in 2020, including Viktar Babaryka and Siarhei Tsikhanouski. &#x201C;Prison is for people who have opened their mouths too wide and who have broken the law. Don&apos;t you have prisons in Britain and America?&#x201D; Lukashenko countered when asked about jailed opposition figures in a recent interview with the BBC. Reflecting on the days immediately following the 2020 election, Halubovich recalls the pervasive sense of fear that hung in the air. On the night following the election, as she and others waited outside her school for election results, some panicked and fled at the sight of the police. An internet shutdown made it difficult to communicate properly, get news, or coordinate &#x2014; not to mention get news of what was happening to the outside world. &quot;&#x200B;&#x200B;The &apos;point of no return&apos; for me came the night when the police released some of those who had been arrested and tortured in the first days,&quot; Halubovich said. &quot;I spent the entire night outside Akrestina prison &#x2014; the most terrifying place in Belarus &#x2014; where people were released by morning, horribly beaten. Some of them were too afraid to even sit in an ambulance, it was like they were half-mad after being tortured.&quot; After several weeks, the protests began to lose their momentum. From every march she attended beginning in September 2020, Komar recalled beginning to sense a lack of clear strategy among the movement and felt that it was often unclear what the right course of action should be.

(Petras Malukas / AFP via Getty Images)&quot;Still, I kept joining the marches and protests until early 2021. It was simply the need to keep going &#x2014; because to stop would have meant letting down all the people still behind bars in Belarus,&quot; Komar said. &quot;I remember one of the final neighborhood marches, feeling exhausted and desperate, but thinking of Mikita Zalatarou, the 17-year-old political prisoner with epilepsy who was tortured in prison. The drive to do something to free him became my only fuel.&quot; The regime&apos;s relentless brutality against those who opposed Lukashenko highlights the immense challenges the movement faced from the onset. &quot;Unfortunately, we weren&apos;t ready to seize the opportunities that briefly arose during the moment of disarray among (those in power),&quot; Alina Rudina, a Belarusian journalist now living in Ukraine, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Never again can we underestimate the enemy&apos;s cruelty and what they are willing to do to maintain their power.&quot; Over 30 years into his reign, Lukashenko seems poised to remain in power for the foreseeable future, but many of the Belarusians who took part in the 2020 protests hesitate to look back on that period as a total defeat. For pro-democracy Belarusians, the events of 2020 were largely a moment of national awakening &#x2014; one that reignited a sense of independence, rekindled pride in their language and history, and fortified their resolve to break free from Russia&apos;s influence over their country. Under Lukashenko&apos;s rule over the past three decades, Russia&apos;s cultural and political reach remained entrenched in Belarusian society. However, the ongoing crisis has provided Belarusians in exile with an opportunity to assert the distinctiveness of their language and culture, challenging years of Russification and reaffirming their national identity. &quot;My sense of identity is more Belarusian now than it was before 2020. I make a conscious effort to avoid reading or watching anything Russian, and I&apos;m grateful that my mind feels so clear and free from that imperialistic influence,&quot; Halubovich said. For those Belarusians who have sought refuge in wartime Ukraine, this choice of language holds even greater significance. Rudina, who has lived in Ukraine for nearly five years, finds that her new home has helped to foster an environment that has allowed her to rediscover the Belarusian language, which she now uses daily in both her personal and professional life.

Thank you for taking the time to read this article. The Belarusian people&apos;s ongoing struggle for a better future is both courageous and inspiring. Despite bravely facing Lukashenko&apos;s harsh authoritarian regime, their efforts receive far too little attention. They deserve greater recognition and our unwavering support.

Russia introduces history textbook that redefines war against Ukraine as justified defense	Military History of Russia, a new textbook introduced in Moscow on Jan. 27, frames the war in Ukraine as a continuation of the Soviet battle against Nazi Germany, portraying the invasion as a necessary reaction to Western threats, Reuters reported. The three-volume textbook, targeted at schoolchildren, claims Russia was &quot;forced&quot; to invade Ukraine in 2022, citing long-standing grievances such as NATO&apos;s eastward expansion and the 2014 ousting of Ukraine&apos;s pro-Russian president, which the textbook characterizes as a Western-backed coup. Edited by Vladimir Medinsky, a presidential advisor and architect of Kremlin propaganda, the textbook aligns with the Russian government&apos;s narrative about the war. The book describes Ukraine as an &quot;aggressive anti-Russian bridgehead&quot; and emphasizes battlefield heroism while drawing parallels between modern Russian military tactics and those employed by the Soviet army during World War II. This publication is part of a broader Kremlin effort to reshape public perception through education. In 2023, Russia&apos;s Education Ministry updated school history textbooks to include sections on the war in Ukraine &#x2014; referred to as a &quot;special military operation&quot; &#x2014; the annexation of Crimea and the impact of Western sanctions. Russia&apos;s Education Ministry initiative, Conversations about Important Things, launched in 2022, promotes themes like patriotism, traditional family values, and Russian nuclear security to students as young as six. The program includes video lessons featuring figures such as Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Patriarch Kirill. The Kremlin&apos;s intensified focus on historical revisionism and ideological education reflects its attempt to solidify domestic support for the war, casting Russia as a defender of sovereignty against a hostile and &quot;decadent&quot; West. Critics argue these measures are an apparent effort to indoctrinate young Russians and justify the ongoing war to future generations.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-introduces-history-textbook-that-redefines-ukraine-war-as-justified-defense/	2025-01-27T10:42:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1243621433-3.jpg
EU agrees to ease sanctions on Syria following Assad's fall, chief diplomat says	The European Union&apos;s foreign ministers reached a political agreement on Jan. 27 to ease sanctions on Syria following the collapse of dictator Bashar al-Assad&apos;s regime. The move comes as opposition forces captured Damascus on Dec. 8 in a rapid offensive, toppling Assad after 24 years in power. &quot;While we aim to move fast, the lifting of sanctions can be reversed if wrong steps are taken,&quot; EU chief diplomat Kaja Kallas posted on X, adding that the EU plans to scale up humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts in Syria. The agreement may include lifting energy and transportation-related sanctions, though restrictions on financial transactions remain under discussion, Reuters reported on Jan. 26. The policy shift reflects growing support within the EU for cooperating with Syria&apos;s new leadership. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron previously expressed their readiness to work with the rebel forces that ousted Assad. Syria has also taken steps to distance itself from Russia. The port of Tartus recently terminated a 49-year investment deal with Russian construction company Stroytransgaz. Ukraine has also engaged with Syria&apos;s new leadership. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha visited Damascus on Dec. 30 to discuss Russia&apos;s military presence in Syria. Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi noted that Kyiv and Syria share similar views on the issue, though specific details were not disclosed.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-agrees-to-ease-sanctions-on-syria-after-assads-regime-falls-chief-diplomat-says/	2025-01-27T10:38:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188252219.jpg
Lithuania, Estonia pledge 5% defense spending, following Trump's call, FT reports	Lithuania and Estonia have become the first NATO members to meet U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s call to raise defense spending to more than 5% of GDP, Financial Times reported on Jan. 27. Trump reiterated his demand on Jan. 7, urging NATO allies to increase their defense contributions beyond the current 2% benchmark, citing the need for Europe to take greater responsibility for its security amid Russia&apos;s ongoing full-scale war in Ukraine. Lithuania&apos;s Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys, reportedly described the shift as part of a &quot;new era,&quot; with Vilnius committing to spending between 5% and 6% of its GDP on defense annually until at least 2030. Estonia followed suit, with Prime Minister Kristen Michal pledging to raise defense spending from 3.7% of GDP to 5%. This would put the Baltic nations well ahead of most NATO members and even the United States, which allocated 3.38% of its GDP to defense in 2024. In July, Poland&apos;s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said his country would spend 5% of its GDP on defense in 2025, becoming the first NATO country to do so. The announcements come as NATO members debate raising the alliance-wide defense spending target to 3% of GDP by 2030, still below Trump&apos;s proposed 5% benchmark. While 24 member states met the current 2% target in 2024, several, including Italy, Canada, and Spain, remain below this threshold. Poland led NATO in defense spending last year, allocating 4.12% of GDP, followed by Estonia and the U.S. Trump&apos;s pressure on NATO allies to increase defense budgets reflects his long-standing criticism of what he perceives as Europe&apos;s reliance on American security guarantees. His remarks in February 2024 &#x2014; threatening to let Russia &quot;do whatever the hell they want&quot; to NATO members failing to meet spending criteria &#x2014; sparked international outrage, raising concerns about his commitment to the alliance&apos;s collective defense principle.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-estonia-pledge-5-defense-spending-following-trumps-call-ft-reports/	2025-01-27T09:22:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179841418.jpg
EU suspends visa privileges for Georgian officials over democratic backsliding	The European Union suspended parts of its visa facilitation agreement with Georgia on Jan. 27, citing concerns over the country&apos;s democratic backsliding. &quot;Fundamental rights and democratic values are core principles of EU integration. Officials that represent a country which trample down these values should not benefit from easier access to the EU,&quot; said Tomasz Siemoniak, Poland&apos;s interior minister. The decision follows mass protests in Tbilisi over parliamentary elections that the opposition belives were nor free nor fair and a political crisis sparked by Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze&apos;s announcement that Georgia&apos;s EU integration could be delayed until 2028. The suspension applies to members of Georgian official delegations, government and parliamentary officials, Constitutional and Supreme Court judges, and holders of diplomatic passports. Ordinary Georgian citizens will retain visa-free travel to the EU for short-term trips. The ruling Georgian Dream party, founded by oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, has drawn criticism for steering Georgia closer to Russia while hindering its EU accession. A controversial foreign agents law adopted earlier in 2024 led the EU to freeze Georgia&apos;s membership process effectively, while a package of anti-LGBTQ laws further exacerbated the crisis.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-suspends-visa-privileges-for-georgian-officials-over-democratic-backsliding/	2025-01-27T09:06:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1250058338.jpg
Procurement for Ukrainian forces may be blocked due to legal conflict, Defense Procurement Agency's head says	The acquisition of ammunition through the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) may be blocked due to a legal conflict, Maryna Bezrukova, the head of the agency, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. On Jan. 23, the DPA&apos;s supervisory board unanimously voted to extend Bezrukova&apos;s contract for another year. Yet, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov overruled the board&apos;s decision on Jan. 24, saying that he would not renew Bezrukova&apos;s contract as head of the DPA. He cited allegedly unsatisfactory results as the reason and appointed Rustem Zhmadilov, who also manages the State Logistics Operator (DOT). Following Umerov&apos;s move, DPA declared that it continues to operate under Bezrukova&apos;s leadership. &quot;Contracting and supplies may be blocked because we are in a legal conflict. I cannot perform my duties now because of certain registration procedures,&quot; Bezrukova told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. &quot;The newly appointed interim acting director is also unlikely to be able to perform his duties, as his appointment contradicts the law, the charter, and in general, we actually have a legal block. I do not know why this was done; it is a very strange situation.&quot; Bezrukova added that it is difficult to predict the consequences of the minister&apos;s decision and called the situation &quot;a serious reputational loss&quot; that could negatively affect relations with Ukraine&apos;s foreign partners. &quot;My only concern is how to get out of it properly and how we can bring it back to the right legal framework not to stop the contracting and supply processes, not to jeopardize my actions as the head of the agency,&quot; she said. Bezrukova also noted that Umerov publicly supported her at staff meetings and did not express any complaints about her work&apos;s quality. According to Ukrainian law, supervisory boards have the authority to hire and fire the heads of state enterprises unilaterally. This means that legally, after the board&apos;s vote, Bezrukova should take over the Defense Procurement Agency for another year. However, due to amendments recently made to the agency&apos;s charter by the Defense Ministry, which oversees the DPA, the ministry can reverse the supervisory board&apos;s decisions. Anti-corruption activists and lawmakers say that the amendments and Umerov&#x2019;s decision are &quot;unlawful.&quot; Following Umerov&apos;s move, the Anti-Corruption Action Center filed a complaint with the country&apos;s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) to open an investigation against Umerov on suspicion of alleged abuse of power. Bezrukova took over the agency in January 2024, and her contract expires at the end of January 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/procurement-for-ukrainian-forces-may-be-blocked-due-to-legal-conflict-defense-procurement-agencys-head-says/	2025-01-27T08:30:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/DSC01217.jpg
Trump needs to 'understand where the threat is,' UK lawmaker says	U.S. President Donald Trump needs to &quot;understand where the threat is&quot; and not &quot;force Ukraine into a bad deal,&quot; U.K. lawmaker Iain Duncan Smith told the Kyiv Independent. In an interview in Kyiv alongside another U.K. lawmaker Layla Moran on Jan. 22, Smith urged Trump not to rush his approach to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and recognize that a &quot;totalitarian axis&quot; of Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea needs to be confronted. &quot;Just understand where the threat is. It&apos;s not Ukraine that&apos;s a threat,&quot; he said. &quot;The threat is Russia and China, Iran, North Korea, all these states are together. So don&apos;t force Ukraine into a bad deal,&quot; he added. Since taking office on Jan. 20, Trump has called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to &quot;make a deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine, warning that failure to reach an agreement would lead to increased sanctions, tariffs, and taxes on Russian goods. But his confrontational approach to the Kremlin has not been reflected in early comments about other members of the &quot;totalitarian axis.&quot; In comments via videolink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 23, Trump said he had &quot;always had a great relationship&quot; with Chinese President Xi Jinping, adding that he is looking forward to &quot;getting along with China.&#x201D; Referring to the war in Ukraine, Trump said &#xA0;China has &quot;a great deal of power over that situation&quot; and that he hoped the U.S. could work with Beijing to end the full-scale invasion. Despite issuing a slew of wide-ranging directives and executive orders in his first days in office, Trump is yet to impose his long-promised tariffs on Chinese imports. He also issued a reprieve to the Chinese-owned app TikTok, which was facing a ban in the U.S. All of this signals that the White House may be open to cutting deals with Beijing in economic and business matters. Former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith during an interview at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester, England, on Oct. 3, 2023. (Justin Tallis / AFP via Getty Images)But Smith said it was impossible to distinguish between business and geopolitics when dealing with China. &quot;It doesn&apos;t work,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;For these totalitarian states, business and politics are exactly one and the same thing.&quot; Originally raising the issue of the &quot;totalitarian axis&quot; in an op-ed published on Jan. 19, Smith said events since its publication only bolstered his case, highlighting a televised conference between Putin and Xi on the day Trump took office. &quot;It&apos;s quite interesting because it does just restate the fact that this (totalitarian axis) is there,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;The only reason Russia continues in this war is because of China.&quot; Although China has positioned itself as a possible mediator between Russia and Ukraine in future negotiations, Beijing remains Moscow&apos;s key economic ally and leading source of dual-use goods that feed the Kremlin&apos;s war machine. As for North Korea, in an interview on Jan. 23, Trump said he intends to reach out to Kim Jong Un, lauding him as a &quot;smart guy&quot; and &quot;not a religious zealot.&quot; Trump and Kim held three meetings during Trump&#x2019;s first term as president but neither one brought progress on the diplomatic front between the U.S. and North Korea. &quot;I&apos;ll reach out to him again,&quot; Trump said in an interview with Fox News. Kim has become one of Putin&#x2019;s key allies in the war against Ukraine, providing ballistic missiles and artillery and sending about 12,000 troops to fight in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran in her Westminster office, London, on Dec. 18, 2023. (Henry Nicholls / AFP via Getty Images)Both Smith and Moran &#x2014; who came to Ukraine to support the work of the British charity Hopefull which cooks up and delivers pizzas in communities close to the front lines &#x2014; said it was important to be in the country in the same week that Trump took office. The two believed it would be especially important if, in his inauguration speech, Trump hinted at forcing Ukraine to make concessions in a peace agreement unfavorable to Kyiv. &quot;It&apos;s interesting that Trump didn&apos;t say that,&quot; Moran said, adding he only alluded to Ukraine during sections criticizing former U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s foreign policy, and his plans for the U.S. military, the success of which would be measured &quot;not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end and, perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.&quot; &quot;But he didn&apos;t talk about (concessions) specifically and that can only be seen as a good thing,&quot; Moran said. &quot;But if Trump had said something that would have absolutely set the hares running, I thought it was personally really important (to be here). &quot;In that eventuality, to have friends on the ground and to look people in the eye and go, &apos;no, we are still on your side, you have a right to determine your own future,&apos; would have been really important,&quot; she added. As for the U.K.&apos;s support for Ukraine, Smith said he was &quot;very proud&quot; of the country&apos;s consistent support for Kyiv which has been in contrast to some of Kyiv&apos;s other European allies. Slovakia and Czechia are &quot;sliding in the other direction,&quot; Germany &quot;simply wasn&apos;t prepared for any of this,&quot; and France &quot;seems to play fast and loose with the whole issue.&quot; &quot;One day, they&apos;re gung-ho, the next day they&apos;re flirting with the idea of peace. Macron doesn&apos;t quite know where he&apos;s going to go one day to the next,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-needs-to-understand-where-the-threat-is-uk-lawmaker-says/	2025-01-27T08:06:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194444069.jpg
Kremlin backs Lukashenko's 'victory' in Belarus election, dismisses Western criticism	The Kremlin on Jan. 27 welcomed Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko&apos;s claimed election victory, dismissing Western criticism of the vote as &quot;expected.&quot; Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since 1994 and is Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s closest ally, was declared the winner with 86.82% of the vote. &quot;The elections in Belarus were transparent and absolutely legitimate. Moscow does not take into account the expected criticism of the elections in Belarus in the West,&quot; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian media. Lukashenko competed for the presidency against regime-approved candidates Sergey Syrankov, who secured 3.21% of the vote, and Oleg Gaidukevich, who received 2%, while 3.6% of ballots reportedly voted &quot;against all.&quot; EU&apos;s chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, criticized Lukashenko ahead of the election, denouncing it as a sham and an affront to democracy. &quot;Lukashenko has clung to power for 30 years. This is a blatant affront to democracy. Lukashenko doesn&#x2019;t have any legitimacy,&quot; she said. Exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who contested the 2020 election, condemned the results, calling the vote a &quot;special operation&quot; to illegally maintain power. The 2020 election, marked by mass protests and a violent crackdown, became pivotal in Belarus&apos; history. Lukashenko claimed victory despite widespread evidence of fraud, while Tsikhanouskaya asserted she won 60% of the vote. Since then, over 60,000 Belarusians have been detained for political reasons, according to the human rights group Viasna.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-backs-lukashenkos-victory-in-belarus-election-dismisses-western-criticism/	2025-01-27T07:50:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1962850139.jpg
EU to continue talks with Ukraine on gas supplies to Europe, including Hungary, Slovakia, Reuters reports	The European Commission will continue negotiations with Ukraine on gas supplies to Europe, including Hungary and Slovakia, according to an EU diplomat&apos;s statement obtained by Reuters on Jan. 27. Ukraine ended Russian gas supplies to Europe on Jan. 1, following the end of the contract. Some EU countries, including Hungary and Slovakia, still rely on Russian gas in their energy system. The EU diplomat&apos;s statement was read out before a meeting of EU foreign ministers, during which they were to discuss the extension of sanctions against Russia, according to Reuters. &quot;The Commission is ready to continue discussions with Ukraine on the supply to Europe through the gas pipeline system in Ukraine,&quot; the statement said. &quot;The Commission is ready to associate Hungary in the process along with Slovakia.&quot; EU foreign ministers eventually agreed to extend the sanctions, providing &quot;requested guarantees&quot; on energy security demanded by Budapest. Prior, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban threatened to veto the decision to extend the restrictions until Ukraine resumed transit of Russian gas to Europe. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, in turn, threatened to limit aid to Ukraine and decrease electricity supplies due to the termination of Russian gas transit. Fico and his Hungarian counterpart Orban have been among some of the most vocal opponents of Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit. Despite Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, Orban and Fico have continued to maintain friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting with him and promoting pro-Russian narratives in Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-to-continue-talks-with-ukraine-on-gas-supplies-to-europe-including-hungary-slovakia-reuters-reports/	2025-01-27T07:26:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1247343791.jpg
Russia intensifies attacks near Pokrovsk, seeks to encircle Ukrainian forces	Russian forces have intensified their assaults near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, deploying small groups in an attempt to encircle Ukrainian troops, Victor Trehubov, spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces, said on Jan. 27 on national television. &quot;For the first time, they started to fight smart; for the first time, they started to fight not just with direct human waves, but with attempts to cover, with attempts to bypass a large city and force Ukrainian forces to leave it,&quot; Trehubov said. The area near Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub for Ukrainian forces, has been at the center of heavy fighting for months. &quot;The situation is as follows: there is a large number of small-scale clashes near Pokrovsk because Russians are trying to enter and surround Pokrovsk from the west in small groups. There are many, many clashes there,&quot; Trehubov said. The estimated Russian advance in the Pokrovsk sector in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 27, 2025, according to DeepState map. A white symbol marks Pokrovsk. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Pokrovsk and Kurakhove remain focal points of Russia&apos;s eastern offensive, now in its fifth month. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported that Russian troops are continuing to push on multiple axes, including Lyman, Siversk, Kramatorsk, Toretsk, and Kurakhove. Trehubov said the Russian command is avoiding urban battles to reduce heavy personnel losses. Despite these efforts, Moscow has so far failed to outflank Pokrovsk and sever its logistics routes.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-intensifies-attacks-near-pokrovsk-seeks-to-encircle-ukrainian-forces/	2025-01-27T07:14:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2191667263.jpg
EU screening of Ukraine’s legislation to continue until fall of 2025	The bilateral screening process of Ukrainian legislation for compliance with EU standards will continue until the fall of 2025, European Pravda reported on Jan. 27, citing the European Commission&apos;s spokesperson. Ukraine applied for EU membership at the onset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. The country has made quick progress, achieving candidate status within months, with the initial negotiations process formally launching in June 2024. If Ukraine fulfills all the requirements, the commission expects the launch of cluster negotiations, starting with Cluster I, &quot;Fundamentals,&quot; &quot;as soon as possible&quot; in 2025, the spokesperson told the Ukrainian media outlet. The commission submitted the first Cluster I screening report for Ukraine on Jan. 16. The Cluster I opens first and closes last in the EU accession negotiations. The presentation of the report is the first step in the EU accession negotiations, during which the commission familiarizes the candidate country with its rights and obligations. During the second stage, the commission assesses the candidate&apos;s progress in terms of legal harmonization and ability to apply the EU acquis. The screening report will then be discussed with member states in the EU Council, European Pravda reported. The spokesperson added that a unanimous decision of all EU member states is required in accession negotiations. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 15 that Ukraine has the &quot;ambitious goal&quot; of opening five or all the six EU accession negotiation clusters in 2025. Ukraine will open two or three negotiation clusters in the first six months of 2025 under Poland&apos;s rotating presidency, and three more during the second half of the year under the Danish presidency, the president said.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-screening-of-ukraine-legislation-to-last-until-fall/	2025-01-27T06:33:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167201231.jpg
Mural depicting top presidential aide Yermak appears in Kyiv, is painted over soon after	A mural depicting Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak was covered with white paint within a day after a picture of it emerged online, the Glavcom media outlet reported on Jan. 27. The mural was painted on the bank of the Dnipro River in Kyiv by an unknown artist. The original photo of the mural was shared on social media by journalist and blogger Bohdan Butkevych on Jan. 26, who also posted its location. Yermak has been described as the most powerful chief of staff in Ukraine&apos;s history, attracting criticism for accumulating unprecedented power and influence within the Presidential Office. &#x423; &#x43F;&#x430;&#x440;&#x43A;&#x443; &#xAB;&#x412;&#x435;&#x440;&#x431;&#x43D;&#x438;&#x439; &#x433;&#x430;&#x439;&#xBB; &#x445;&#x442;&#x43E;&#x441;&#x44C; &#x441;&#x442;&#x432;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x438;&#x432; &#x43C;&#x443;&#x440;&#x430;&#x43B; &#x456;&#x437; &#x437;&#x43E;&#x431;&#x440;&#x430;&#x436;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x43D;&#x44F;&#x43C; &#x404;&#x440;&#x43C;&#x430;&#x43A;&#x430;, &#x430;&#x43B;&#x435; &#x437;&#x430;&#x440;&#x430;&#x437; &#x43C;&#x430;&#x43B;&#x44E;&#x43D;&#x43E;&#x43A; &#x437;&#x430;&#x444;&#x430;&#x440;&#x431;&#x43E;&#x432;&#x430;&#x43D;&#x43E; &#x431;&#x456;&#x43B;&#x438;&#x43C; &#x43A;&#x43E;&#x43B;&#x44C;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x43E;&#x43C; pic.twitter.com/QftYRKL3Ha &quot;Banksy suddenly becoming a fan of Yermak is unlikely,&quot; Butkevych said jokingly, raising a question about the original painter&#x2019;s identity. Glavcom reported that already by the evening of Jan. 26, a picture of the mural largely painted over by a white paint appeared online. Other leading figures like former Commander-in-Chief General Valerii Zaluzhnyi also received a mural in the capital.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-mural-depicting-yermak-painted-over/	2025-01-27T06:11:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2030107886.jpg
Military intelligence denies its head gave Ukraine until summer to launch talks or endanger country’s existence	Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence (HUR) denied on Jan. 27 media reports that its head, Kyrylo Budanov, predicted serious consequences for the existence of Ukraine unless negotiations begin by the summer during a confidential parliamentary meeting. Although HUR&#x2019;s statement did not specify the alleged quote, an assessment attributed to Budanov began circulating in the Ukrainian media earlier on Jan. 27. &quot;If there are no serious negotiations by the summer, then very dangerous processes for the very existence of Ukraine may begin,&quot; an undisclosed source told Ukrainska Pravda, referring to an alleged statement by Budanov during a closed-door parliamentary meeting. &quot;The Ukrainian military intelligence would like to draw the attention&#x2026; to the fact that the alleged quote of (Budanov)... from a closed, classified session of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine&#x2026; is not true,&quot; HUR&#x2019;s statement read. Ukrainska Pravda did not specify what processes the military spy chief was said to have in mind. In office since 2020, Budanov has at time made radical predictions about the full-scale war that have not always come true. The news comes amid growing expectation of peace talks as U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table. Short on manpower, Kyiv will soon begin the fourth year of the full-scale war on its back foot, with Russia holding or pushing the front line on key directions such as the southwestern edge of Donetsk Oblast or Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. Trump&#x2019;s special peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, said the U.S. aims to end the war in the first 100 days of Trump&#x2019;s presidency.	https://kyivindependent.com/hur-denies-budanov-quote-in-media/	2025-01-27T06:00:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2030699290.jpg
Zelensky’s party’s parliamentary leader attended Trump’s inauguration, media reports	David Arakhamia, the parliamentary leader of President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s Servant of the People party, was among the few foreign dignitaries that attended U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration last week, Independent reported on Jan. 26. Arakhamia was attending the event along with former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, among others, Independent wrote. The lawmaker declined to comment on his presence at the inauguration when approached by the Kyiv Independent. Arakhamia also attended an event called Stars and Stripes &amp; Union Jack party on Jan. 17 before the inauguration, alongside the innermost circles of the Trump administration, Independent claimed, citing unnamed sources. Following the event, Arakhamia told the media that he expects a formal Ukrainian delegation to meet with the U.S. president&#x2019;s team next month. After his inauguration on Jan. 20, Trump reiterated his intent to pursue a peace deal in Ukraine but offered few specifics. Trump has also voiced his intent to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss a potential peace deal in Ukraine. The U.S. president told reporters on Jan. 20 that Putin is &quot;destroying Russia by not making a deal&quot; while acknowledging doubts about Moscow&apos;s willingness to negotiate. The Trump administration&apos;s Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, is also expected to visit Ukraine and meet Ukrainian officials.	https://kyivindependent.com/arakhamia-reportedly-at-trump-inauguration/	2025-01-27T04:41:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1263380211.jpg
EU foreign ministers agree to extend sanctions against Russia	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. European Union foreign ministers approved the extension of sanctions against Russia on Jan. 27, the EU&#x2019;s chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, announced on X. &quot;Europe delivers: EU foreign ministers just agreed to extend again the sanctions on Russia. This will continue to deprive Moscow of revenues to finance its war. Russia needs to pay for the damage they are causing,&quot; Kallas wrote on X.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-foreign-ministers-agree-to-extend-sanctions-against-russia/	2025-01-27T03:49:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2154602469.jpg
North Korean troops temporarily withdraw from contact line in Kursk Oblast after losses, Sky News reports	North Korean soldiers temporarily withdrew from the contact line in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast after incurring heavy losses, Sky News reported on Jan. 27, citing a Ukrainian commander with a callsign &quot;Puls&quot; who is fighting in the area. North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in early August 2024. Ukrainian forces have continued fighting in the region, hoping to leverage their positions for potential negotiations. North Korean forces are taking respite from hostilities, presumably to treat the wounded, wait for reinforcements, and work on mistakes made during the fighting in this sector, according to Sky News. &quot;Puls&quot; assumed that this break will not last long and the North Korean military &quot;will be back soon.&quot; The soldier also noted North Korean troops&apos; high motivation and that they continued the offensive despite heavy losses. North Korean soldiers were unaware of the threats from drones and artillery and attacked on foot in large groups, &quot;like in World War II,&quot; becoming an easy target, &quot;Puls&quot; added. There is poor coordination and a language barrier between North Korean and Russian troops barrier that has already led to North Korean soldiers targeting Russian positions, according to the Ukrainian military. Ukrainian forces take DNA samples from killed North Korean soldiers to confirm their participation in Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. South Korean intelligence announced at the end of January that Pyongyang was planning to send more troops to Russia to participate in the war. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, also said previously that Pyongyang is preparing reinforcements, mainly gun and rocket artillery units. The New York Times reported that according to an undisclosed U.S. official, fresh North Korean troops could arrive within two months.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-temporarily-withdraw-from-contact-line-in-kursk-oblast-amid-heavy-losses-sky-news-reports/	2025-01-27T03:45:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029588238--1-.jpg
Hungary receives ’requested guarantees’ from EU on energy transit, Hungarian FM says	The EU has provided Hungary with &quot;requested guarantees&quot; regarding its &quot;energy security&quot; concerns, namely the transit of fossil fuels to EU member states, Hungary&#x2019;s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Jan. 27. &quot;The European Commission is committed to protecting natural gas and oil pipelines leading to European Union member states,&quot; the Hungarian chief diplomat said, adding that the European Commission will also ask Kyiv to maintain the oil transit through its territory. &quot;They made it clear that the integrity of the energy infrastructure supplying EU member states is a matter of security for the entire EU.&quot; The statement comes after Politico reported that EU ambassadors are expected to issue a statement addressing Hungary&#x2019;s &quot;energy security&quot; concerns to convince Budapest to drop its veto on the extension of the EU&#x2019;s sanctions on Russia. Hungary&#x2019;s Prime Minister Viktor Orban has threatened to veto the extension until Ukraine resumes the transit of Russian gas through its territory. The end of transit led to a spat between Kyiv on one side and Hungary and Slovakia on the other, with the two latter countries complaining the decision endangers their energy security. Ukraine continues to transit Russian oil, though a bill on banning the transit has been reigstered in the parliament. The EU sanctions against Russia, including the freezing of billions of Russian sovereign assets in European bank accounts, require a renewal by unanimous decision by the bloc every six months. The current deadline is set to expire on Jan. 31. Szijjarto did not reveal whether his country intends to lift its veto on the sanctions extension after the EU&#x2019;s decision. Earlier, Orban, a close ideological ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, demanded to vote on the renewal of the sanctions package only after Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Orban, whose government is widely regarded as the most Russia-friendly in the EU, has repeatedly criticized and delayed sanctions against Russia. Trump recently issued a warning to Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his war in Ukraine or face tariffs and further sanctions by the U.S. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also called his Hungarian counterpart on Jan. 26 to discuss, among others, energy issues, a statement by the U.S. Embassy to Hungary said, without revealing specifics of the discussion.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-receives-guarantees-on-energy/	2025-01-27T03:26:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1258722653.jpg

Zelensky arrives in Poland for Holocaust Remembrance Day commemoration	Editor&#x2019;s note: The story is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Poland for a commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi Auschwitz death camp, Zelensky&#x2019;s spokesperson, Serhii Nykyforov, told Ukrinform on Jan. 27. Jan. 27 marks the day when the Red Army liberated one of the largest Nazi death camps located in occupied Poland. The date was chosen as the International Holocaust Remembrance Day to commemorate the World War II-era massacre of 6 million Jews and millions of other victims by Nazi Germany. Prior to his visit to Poland, on Jan. 26, the Ukrainian president honored the Holocaust victims at the Babyn Yar National Historical and Memorial Reserve in Kyiv, a site of a Nazi massacre of Jews in 1941. Zelensky&#x2019;s visit to Poland will also include bilateral meetings with world leaders, namely with European Council President Antonio Costa and French President Emmanuel Macron, Nykyforov said.

5 injured as Russia shells industrial area in Nikopol	Five men aged 30-39 were injured as a result of a Russian artillery attack against Nikopol in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast in the morning of Jan. 27, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. According to his statement, a fire broke out that was later extinguished, and an industrial facility was damaged. Nikopol, situated on the banks of the dried-up Kakhovka Reservoir, just across from Russian-occupied Enerhodar and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, is a regular target of Russian attacks. Today&#x2019;s attack comes weeks after Russian forces struck the central market in the city, injuring four women and two men. Only 3% of Russian missiles, drones, and guided bombs hit military targets in Ukraine, while 97% have struck civilian infrastructure, Danylo Kubai, Ukraine&apos;s envoy to international organizations in Vienna, said in July 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/5-injured-as-russia-shells-industrial-area-in-nikopol/	2025-01-27T01:44:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1850844674.jpg
Swedish Coast Guard detains vessel suspected of sabotage in Baltic Sea	Swedish prosecutors announced an investigation into a ship suspected of damaging undersea cables after it was detained by the Swedish Coast Guard, the AP news agency reported on Jan. 27. According to information obtained by the AP from a ship-tracker software, the Malta-flagged Vezhen departed from the Russian port of Ust-Luga several days earlier and was navigating near the site of damage. An underwater fiber-optic cable belonging to the Latvian State Radio and Television Broadcasting Center (LVRTC) was significantly damaged on Jan. 26, reportedly due to external impact, according to LVRTC representative Vineta Sprugaine. The accident came as the latest amid a series of incidents that have damaged critical cables in the Baltic Sea. The cable connected the Latvian town of Ventspils to Sweden&apos;s Gotland island and was located within Sweden&apos;s exclusive economic zone, the statement said. Despite the damage, data transmission services continued using alternate routes, with minimal impact on most end users in Latvia aside from slower data transmission speeds. The previous instances of damaged cables had raised fears that Russian shadow fleet vessels were intentionally sabotaging the energy and communication lines. As a result, NATO dispatched additional patrol ships to the area earlier this month. Contradicting these concerns, intelligence services in the U.S. and Europe are increasingly convinced that the incidents were caused by accidents, the Washington Post reported on Jan. 19.	https://kyivindependent.com/swedish-coast-guard-detains-vessel-suspected-of-sabotage-in-baltic-sea/	2025-01-27T01:32:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1238924684--1-.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure 7 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed two civilians and injured seven over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 27. Overnight on Jan. 27, the Russian military attacked Ukraine with 104 Shahed-type drones and decoy drones, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported on their Telegram channel. Air defenses shot down 57 drones over 10 oblasts, while 39 decoy drones were lost in the airspace, the Air Force said. One person was killed, and two others were injured as a result of the Russian military&#x2019;s attacks on the city of Kherson and 28 other regional settlements, Kherson Oblast Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on his Telegram channel. One person was killed and four were injured in Donetsk Oblast as a result of Russia&#x2019;s attacks, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Due to Russian attacks on the city of Kupiansk, an 86-year-old woman was injured in Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Russian drones also targeted a critical infrastructure facility in western Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Governor Svitlana Onyshchuk reported. The strike started a fire but inflicted no casualties, she said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-2-injure-7-over-past-day/	2025-01-27T00:29:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/2025-01-27-10_26_21.jpg
Russia claims to capture Velyka Novosilka, Ukraine admits partial withdrawal	Russia&#x2019;s Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 26 that its forces had captured Velyka Novosilka, a strategically significant settlement in the western part of Donetsk Oblast. Ukraine&#x2019;s 110th Mechanized Brigade, which is deployed in the area, acknowledged a withdrawal from parts of the village to avoid encirclement but claimed that fighting is ongoing elsewhere in Velyka Novosilka. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The village with a pre-war population of 5,000 lies only around 15 kilometers from the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast and 20 kilometers from Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a region so far untouched by Russian occupation. The estimated Russian advance at Velyka Novosilka, Donetsk Oblast, as of Jan. 26, 2025, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)If confirmed, this would represent the most significant gain of Russian forces in Donetsk Oblast since overrunning Kurakhove earlier in January. The 110th Brigade said that both Russia and Ukraine had parity in equipment but Moscow had significant advantage in manpower. According to the Ukrainian military, Russian forces will struggle to advance their offensive onward. The Mokri Yaly River creates an obstacle for Russia&#x2019;s advance and Russian troops are in a vulnerable &quot;fire pocket,&quot; said the brigade. Fighting is at a very heavy level in Donetsk Oblast and Russian troops continue to advance, albeit slowly, this year. &#x200B;&#x200B;Throughout the fall of 2024, Russian forces made operational gains in southern Donetsk Oblast, including areas near Toretsk and Chasiv Yar, while advancing near Kupiansk and on Russian soil in Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-to-capture-velyka-novosilka/	2025-01-26T23:05:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1997061526.jpg

Lukashenko declares himself 'winner' of Belarus’s presidential vote blasted as sham	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko declared himself president for his seventh consecutive term in an election on Jan. 26 internationally deemed as neither free nor fair. The Belarusian Election Commission claimed that Lukashenko &quot;won&quot; 86.82% of the vote, followed by regime-approved and little-known candidates like Sergey Syrankov with 3.21% or Oleg Gaidukevich with 2.02%. Some 3.6% of the ballots voted &quot;against all.&quot; &quot;You can congratulate the Republic of Belarus, we have elected a president,&quot; said Igor Karpenko, the head of the electoral commission, early on Jan. 27. The commission claimed a 85.7% turnout. Lukashenko, the country&apos;s leader since 1994 and Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s closest ally, has long been accused of staging fraudulent elections in Belarus. In 2020, during the last presidential election, Lukashenko maintained power despite the country&apos;s most prominent opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, receiving popular support. The now-exiled opposition leader said she won with 60% of the vote. Following the fabricated results in 2020, mass protest erupted in Minsk but were ultimately quelled with the support of Russia. According to the Belarusian human rights group Viasna, over 60,000 citizens have been detained for political reasons since the 2020 election. Tsikhanouskaya responded to the election results on Jan. 26 by condemning the legitimacy of the vote and rejecting Lukashenko as president. &quot;These are not elections but a &apos;special operation&apos; to illegally cling to power. Lukashenko, propped up by Putin, holds 9 million Belarusians hostage, drags us into war, and betrays our sovereignty,&quot; she wrote on X. &quot;He does not represent Belarus. The regime must end its repressions, release political prisoners, and be held accountable for its crimes. Belarusians will prevail!&quot; Kaja Kallas, the EU&#x2019;s chief diplomat, echoed similar sentiments on X on Jan. 25. &quot;Lukashenko has clung to power for 30 years. Tomorrow, he&#x2019;ll reappoint himself in yet another sham election. This is a blatant affront to democracy. Lukashenko doesn&#x2019;t have any legitimacy,&quot; she said. Notably, Lukashenko declined to invite a mission from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to observe the country&apos;s presidential election. On Nov. 22, state-run news outlet Belta reported that Lukashenko may completely shut down the internet during the 2025 presidential elections if protests similar to those in 2020 arise. &quot;If this (the protests) happens again, we will shut the internet down completely,&quot; Lukashenko said, admitting that internet shutdowns during the 2020 protests were carried out with his approval. While Belarus has not directly participated in the war against Ukraine, it has allowed the Kremlin to use its territory as a staging ground for its operations. The country is also reportedly hosting Russian tactical nuclear arms on its territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-declares-himself-winner-of-belarusian-presidential-election-seventh-term-to-begin/	2025-01-26T22:19:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2153837875.jpg
Explosions reported in Khmelnytskyi, Ivano-Frankivsk amid drone attack, apartment building damaged in Dnipro	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Several explosions were heard overnight on Jan. 27 in the western Ukrainian cities of Ivano-Frankivsk and Khmelnytskyi as Russia launched a drone attack on Ukraine. Ivano-Frankivsk Mayor Ruslan Martsinkiv urged residents to stay in shelters, as the air raid alert had been active in the region for over two hours. Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast had previously been targeted by Russia on Jan. 15, with the attack damaging &quot;critical infrastructure facilities&quot; in the area, though no casualties were reported at that time. Meanwhile, a drone attack on Jan. 27 also damaged a multi-story residential building in Dnipro, affecting the technical floor, windows, and doors on the upper levels. The explosion and debris caused significant damage to vehicles parked nearby. No immediate reports of injuries or fatalities have been confirmed.	https://kyivindependent.com/explosions-reported-in-khmelnytsky-ivano-frankivsk-amid-drone-attack-apartment-building-damaged-in-dnipro/	2025-01-26T19:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1244030448-1665987223fwizj.jpg
Belarus releases American citizen amid controversial election	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on Jan. 26 that Belarus had &quot;unilaterally&quot; released an American woman from detention, as Alexander Lukashenko is set to win a seventh term in office. Rubio identified the U.S. citizen as Anastassia Nuhfer, who was detained during former President Joe Biden&apos;s tenure. He did not provide details on the timing or reasons for her arrest. Rubio&apos;s statement followed a series of prisoner releases by Lukashenko, often referred to as &quot;Europe&#x2019;s last dictator.&quot; Belarus&apos; oldest human rights group, Viasna, reports that over 1,250 individuals remain in detention for opposing the government. Lukashenko&#x2019;s opponents, many imprisoned or exiled due to his ongoing crackdown on dissent, have condemned Sunday&#x2019;s election as fraudulent. The 2020 election, which sparked months of mass protests, has been widely criticized for its lack of legitimacy. The U.S. State Department later confirmed that Nuhfer had been detained in early December 2024, according to the Associated Press. Earlier this month, a consular officer from Washington gained rare access to her in detention. A former high-ranking Belarusian diplomat told the Associated Press that Nuhfer&apos;s arrest was tied to the 2020 protests, though they did not provide further details. The diplomat, speaking anonymously due to security concerns, added that Lukashenko offered to release Nuhfer &quot;as a gesture of goodwill&quot; but refused to free any Belarusian opposition or rights activists. Lukashenko&#x2019;s support for Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine has strained Belarus&#x2019; relations with both the U.S. and the EU, ending his previous attempts to leverage Western support for more subsidies from Moscow. It remains unclear what, if any, concessions Belarus may have sought in exchange for releasing Nuhfer.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-releases-american-citizen-amid-controversial-election/	2025-01-26T18:17:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1257107756.jpg
Hungary blocks EU statement condemning Belarus election as undemocratic, RFE/RL reports	Hungarian representatives blocked a joint statement by European Union member states rejecting the presidential election in Belarus, sources told Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) in Brussels. Without unanimous support from all 27 EU countries, EU&apos;s chief diplomat Kaja Kallas issued her own statement, declaring that the Jan. 26 election &quot;neither free, nor fair.&quot; She also called on Belarusian authorities to release all political prisoners, &quot;over a thousand of whom are arbitrarily detained, including an employee of the Delegation of the European Union.&quot; Kallas criticized the regime&#x2019;s late invitation to independent election monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), only 10 days before the vote, which she said prevented access to critical stages of the electoral process. &quot;This is yet another proof of a total absence of credibility of these elections,&quot; she said. She further emphasized that Belarus&#x2019;s role in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine and its hybrid attacks on neighboring countries justifies continued EU sanctions and restrictions on the regime. &quot;...The EU will continue imposing restrictive and targeted measures against the regime, while financially supporting civil society, Belarusian democratic forces in exile, and Belarusian culture,&quot; Kallas said. She also noted the EU&#x2019;s readiness to assist Belarus with stabilizing its economy and reforming its institutions once the country begins a democratic transition. Hungary refused to sign the draft statement referring to Belarus&apos;s &quot;undemocratic presidential elections&quot; and was initially joined by Slovakia, according to RFE/RL. However, Slovakia later agreed to support the text, which described the elections as lacking legitimacy due to &quot;relentless and unprecedented repression of human rights,&quot; and severe restrictions on opposition and independent media. Hungarian authorities, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, maintained their opposition. Hungary has consistently resisted tougher sanctions against Russia and increased European support for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-blocks-eu-statement-condemning-belarus-election-as-undemocratic-rfe-rl-reports/	2025-01-26T17:46:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190447641.jpg
Lukashenko poised to secure 7th term in Belarus 'sham' election	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko appeared set to win a seventh term in office on Jan. 26 in an election widely dismissed by the West and opposition groups as a sham. Lukashenko has reportedly secured 86.82% of the vote, according to preliminary results announced by the country&#x2019;s Central Election Commission on Monday. The 70-year-old leader, who has ruled since 1994, faced no real competition, as key opposition figures are either imprisoned or living in exile following years of political repression. Lukashenko&apos;s 2020 re-election, widely criticized as fraudulent, sparked unprecedented protests in Belarus, leading to over 65,000 arrests and widespread reports of police brutality. Western nations responded with sanctions and condemnation. The president, who has relied heavily on Russian subsidies and backing to maintain his grip on power, campaigned this time on a platform of &quot;peace and security.&quot; Lukashenko justified his close alliance with Moscow, which included allowing Russia to use Belarusian territory to launch its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and hosting Russian tactical nuclear weapons. &quot;It&#x2019;s better to have a dictatorship like in Belarus than a democracy like Ukraine,&quot; Lukashenko said during his campaign. Observers suggest the election date was strategically moved to January, avoiding the warmer months when protests might have been more likely. Economic challenges and the ongoing war in Ukraine have heightened tensions in Belarus, but the government ensured no significant opposition emerged in the lead-up to the vote. On election day, Lukashenko engaged in a four-hour press conference where he dismissed criticism about the fairness of the election. Asked about the absence of opposition figures, he replied: &quot;Some chose prison, some chose &apos;exile,&apos; as you say. We didn&#x2019;t kick anyone out of the country.&quot; He also denied allegations of suppressing dissent, claiming opponents had made their own decisions regarding their fate.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-poised-to-secure-7th-term-in-belarus-sham-election/	2025-01-26T15:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1507209313.jpg
Zelensky appoints Ground Forces Commander as lead of Khortytsia Group	President Volodymyr Zelensky appointed Major General Mykhailo Drapatyi, Commander of the Ground Forces of Ukraine, as the head of the Khortytsia Operational Strategic Group on Jan. 26. &quot;Today, I ordered a strengthening of the command structure of our forces in the Donetsk region,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address. He noted that Drapatyi&#x2019;s leadership will focus on the most intense combat areas while also ensuring proper training for brigades. Drapatyi will continue in his role as Commander of the Ground Forces, the largest component of the Armed Forces. Zelensky appointed Drapatyi as commander in Nov. 2024. Drapatyi served as a commander of Ukraine&apos;s 58th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade from 2016 to 2019. He also played one of the key roles in the liberation of Mariupol in Donetsk Oblast in 2014. Additionally, Brigadier General Andrii Hnatov has been appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff to improve coordination between operational headquarters and the front lines. Previously, Hnatov served as Commander of the Joint Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Zelensky appointed him to that role in June 2024. Zelensky said that these and other changes were discussed with Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi to address key military tasks at all levels. &#x201C;The specific needs of the front must determine the standards for equipping and training brigades,&#x201D; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-appoints-ground-forces-commander-as-lead-of-khortytsia-group/	2025-01-26T12:32:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/q132bb595v3e1.jpeg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine strikes drone storage facility in Russia's Oryol Oblast and destroys 200 Shaheds, General Staff reports	Key developments on Jan. 25-26: Ukrainian Air Force units and Defense Forces struck drone storage facilities in Russia&apos;s western Oryol Oblast on Jan. 26, the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces reported on Facebook on Jan. 26. The strike targeted concrete structures housing thermobaric warheads for drones, causing a significant secondary detonation. &#x201C;The results and extent of the damage are being specified, but it is preliminary known that more than 200 &#x2018;Shaheds&#x2019; will no longer be used against our country,&#x201D; the statement said. Preliminary reports indicate that over 200 Shahed strike drones were destroyed, rendering them unusable for future attacks on Ukraine. The statement emphasized that operations against critical facilities supporting attacks on Ukraine&#x2019;s civilian infrastructure will continue. Russia has launched thousands of cheap but effective Iranian-designed Shahed drones against Ukraine since the fall of 2022. Shaheds and its domestic-made variants like Geran are often used for strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Shahed-136 drones&apos; flying range, claimed by various sources, varies from 1,000 kilometers (about 620 miles) to 2,500 kilometers (about 1,550 miles). They are said to weigh about 200 kilograms with a maximum flight speed of about 185 kilometers (115 miles) per hour. Western media, such as the New York Times, has reported the cost of each Shahed-136 drone to be as low as $20,000. The Oryol region was the target of numerous Ukrainian attacks over the last month, when a drone storage, maintenance, and repair facility was destroyed on Dec. 28 and when an oil depot was hit by drones, later catching on fire, on Dec. 22. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on Jan. 24 new guidance that halts spending on most foreign aid grants for 90 days. This directive, which took State Department officials by surprise, appears to include funding for military assistance to Ukraine, Politico reports. According to a document obtained by the news outlet, the guidance requires staff to issue &quot;stop-work orders&quot; on nearly all &quot;existing foreign assistance awards&quot; and is effective immediately. The Kyiv Independent can&apos;t immediately verify this information. Rubio&apos;s guidance goes beyond President Donald Trump&#x2019;s recent executive order, which called for a 90-day pause on foreign aid grants while the secretary reviews them. The president&apos;s order left some ambiguity about whether already appropriated funds or Ukraine aid would be affected, but Rubio&apos;s directive makes it clear that no further actions will be taken to disburse funds for already approved programs, according to current and former officials familiar with the matter. The sweeping nature of the mandate shocked many within the department. &quot;State just totally went nuclear on foreign assistance,&quot; one official told Politico. While the document allows some exceptions&#x2014;such as foreign military financing for Egypt and Israel, emergency food assistance, and &quot;legitimate expenses incurred prior to the date of this&quot; guidance&#x2014;its broad scope leaves room for interpretation. It also states that decisions must remain &quot;consistent with the terms of the relevant award.&quot; Officials believe the halt will affect key allies, including Ukraine, Jordan, and Taiwan. One State Department official and two former Biden administration officials, all speaking anonymously, voiced concerns about the potential impact on these partners. The guidance could expose the U.S. government to lawsuits for unfulfilled contracts if the terms are found to be violated. However, the directive states that decisions regarding the continuation, modification, or termination of programs will follow Rubio&#x2019;s review. The omission of Ukraine aid is particularly concerning for American officials who see supporting Ukraine as essential to defeating Russia. While Republicans, including Trump, have long criticized what they view as wasteful foreign aid under Democratic administrations, Trump has recently intensified his stance on Russia. He has threatened Moscow with sanctions if it does not end its nearly three-year invasion of Ukraine and declared that &quot;Putin bears responsibility for ending the war.&quot; The guidance was reviewed and cleared by several senior State Department officials, including counselor Michael Needham and policy planning director Michael Anton. The department is now tasked with preparing a report within 85 days of the guidance&#x2019;s issuance. Russia fired 1,250 aerial bombs, over 750 attack drones, and 20 missiles at Ukraine in the last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan 26.The attacks targeted Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv,Donetsk, Kherson, Sumy, Kharkiv, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts. One of the worst attacks of the week killed at least one person and injured 45 in Zaporizhzhia after Russian forces pummeled the city with drones and missiles, hitting apartment blocks.Overnight on Jan. 25-26, Russian troops launched 72 drones. Ukraine&#x2019;s air defense downed 50, said the Air Force.&#x201C;Long-range capabilities are crucial. Sanctions are essential. Lowering the price of oil is important. The key is to act in unity and protect lives with resolve,&#x201D; Zelensky wrote on social media.In one of his first address since taking office, President Donald Trump threatened to leverage sanctions against Moscow as well as tackle oil prices that keep Russia&#x2019;s economy afloat.During his speech to the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos on Jan. 23, Trump said that lowering oil prices would end Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine &#x201C;immediately.&#x201D; He said he would ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to decrease oil prices.He&#x2019;s also pushed for ramped-up drilling for U.S. oil and gas which could also undermine Russia&#x2019;s fuel sector.A day before the WEF, Trump said that if a &quot;deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine was not reached soon, he would have no choice but to &quot;put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries.&quot; Ukrainian troops avoided encirclement as Russian forces are poised to capture Velyka Novosilka, Donetsk Oblast, said the 110th Separate Mechanised Brigade. Ukrainian troops successfully withdrew from some areas to avoid being encircled but fighting is ongoing around the village, which lies around 15 kilometers east of the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Equipment on both sides wears thin but Russian infantry vastly outnumbers the Ukrainian side, the brigade wrote on its Telegram channel. While Russian troops will likely capture the village soon, they will struggle to advance their offensive onward. The Mokri Yaly River creates an obstacle for Russia&#x2019;s advance and Russian troops are in a vulnerable &#x201C;fire pocket,&#x201D; said the brigade. &#x201C;Any movement is suppressed by shells and drones,&quot; said the brigade. The river also hindered supply routes to the Ukrainians. On Jan 23, Military spokesperson Viktor Trehubov warned that Ukrainian troops were at risk of encirclement. Russian forces are attempting to take control of access routes to the village through heavy fire, Trehubov noted. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 24 that its troops had planted a Russian flag in the center of Velyka Novosilka and that they had split the town in two, cutting off Ukrainian forces. The southern pocket fell most recently. Experts told the Kyiv Independent that Ukrainian troops were likely holding onto the village&apos;s northwestern areas and Russia expected to complete the capture in &#x201C;days.&#x201D; If they do, it will be Russia&#x2019;s first notable win this year. It is unclear how many Ukrainian troops were trapped inside the southern pocket in Velyka Novosilka, but it could be around two or three battalions, according to Pasi Paroinen at the Finland-based open-source intelligence organization Black Bird Group. The number of soldiers is probably around several hundred, he added. Fighting is at a very heavy level in Donetsk Oblast and Russian troops continue to advance, albeit slowly, this year. &#x200B;&#x200B;Throughout the fall of 2024, Russian forces made operational gains in southern Donetsk Oblast, including areas near Toretsk and Chasiv Yar, while advancing near Kupiansk and on Russian soil in Kursk Oblast. A fire erupted at Russia&apos;s Ryazan Oil Refinery after a drone strike overnight on Jan. 26, according to Russian media reports. The reported strike comes two nights after the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces (SOS) launched a joint attack against the Ryazan Oil Refinery on Jan. 24. Locals reported sounds of explosions and an attempted drone attack on the refinery shortly before 1 a.m. on Jan. 26, the Russian Telegram news channel Astra said. Ryazan Oblast Governor Pavlo Malkov confirmed that Russian air defense units were repelling a drone attack in the region. Andrii Kovalenko, the counter-disinformation chief at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, posted video to his official Telegram channel purporting to show a fire at the refinery after it was hit by drones. Astra confirmed that video footage of the fires circulating online was filmed at the site of the refinery, but said that because of the timing of the strike it was difficult to determine whether the fire was from a new hit or the Jan. 24 attack. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims at the time of publication. The Ryazan Oil Refinery, one of Russia&apos;s largest, has the capacity to process 17 million metric tons of oil per year. Profits from fossil fuels fund Russia&apos;s war machine and Ukraine considers oil industry facilities to be valid military targets. Ryazan lies roughly 500 kilometers (310 miles) north of Ukraine&apos;s border. Ukrainian forces have targeted the Ryazan facility in previous attacks. An SBU source told the Kyiv Independent that at least three oil depots and a workshop were set ablaze in the Jan. 24 strike. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) also carried out a drone attack on the Ryazan Oil Refinery on May 1, 2024. Kovalenko said on Jan. 24 that the refinery is a key facility in Russia&apos;s military-industrial complex. &quot;The refinery plays an important role in providing fuel for both the civilian and military-industrial complex of Russia,&quot; he said on Telegram. &quot;It produces fuel for military equipment, aviation kerosene, diesel fuel and other types of petroleum products used in tanks, aircraft, ships and other equipment of the Russian Armed Forces.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-strikes-drone-storage-facility-in-russias-oryol-oblast-and-destroys-200-shaheds-general-staff-reports/	2025-01-26T12:01:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/ryazan.jpg

Fiber-optic cable between Latvia and Sweden significantly damaged in Baltic Sea, investigation underway	An underwater fiber-optic cable belonging to the Latvian State Radio and Television Broadcasting Center (LVRTC) was significantly damaged on Jan. 26, reportedly due to external impact, according to LVRTC representative Vineta Sprugaine. The cable connected the Latvian town of Ventspils to Sweden&apos;s Gotland island and was located within Sweden&apos;s exclusive economic zone, the statement said. Despite the damage, data transmission services continued using alternate routes, with minimal impact on most end users in Latvia aside from slower data transmission speeds. NATO has already dispatched additional patrol ships to the region in response to concerns over the safety of critical infrastructure. LVRTC has informed the relevant authorities, and inspections are ongoing, though the exact nature of the damage, which occurred at a depth of over 50 meters, will only be confirmed during repair work. Latvian Prime Minister Evika Sili&#x146;a convened a meeting with ministers and service heads to address the incident, emphasizing continued cooperation with NATO and Baltic Sea region countries to investigate the circumstances. &#x201C;We are working together with our Swedish Allies and NATO on investigating the incident, including patrolling the area, as well as inspecting the vessels that were in the area. Authorities have intensified information exchange and started criminal investigation,&#x201D; Silina wrote on X. This marks the second recent incident of damaged critical cables in the Baltic Sea. The cable damage on Jan. 26 follows the Dec. 25 sabotage of four telecommunication cables and one power cable in the Baltic Sea, with Finnish authorities suspecting the involvement of the Russian &quot;shadow fleet&quot; vessel Eagle S. Amid a series of similar events, the incidents had raised fears that Russian shadow fleet vessels were intentionally sabotaging the energy and communication lines. As a result, NATO dispatched additional patrol ships to the area earlier this month. However, intelligence services in the U.S. and Europe increasingly believe the damage is caused by maritime accidents, not deliberate sabotage, according to the Washington Post on Jan. 19. Still, investigations are ongoing, and growing concerns over Russian sabotage remain, particularly in light of heightened tensions in the Baltic Sea region since Western nations began supporting Ukraine following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Recent incidents, such as suspicious activity by Russian-registered vessels near Denmark and Sweden, have added to fears of potential hybrid warfare targeting critical infrastructure in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/fiber-optic-cable-between-latvia-and-sweden-significantly-damaged-in-baltic-sea-investigation-underway/	2025-01-26T10:38:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1241362288.jpg
Suspilne: Washington orders USAID to suspend projects and funding in Ukraine	The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), one of the largest official aid agencies in the world, has been told to stop projects in Ukraine following a 90-day foreign aid freeze imposed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Ukrainian media Suspilne reported, citing sources in the agency, on Jan. 26. The sweeping directive took immediate effect on Jan. 24, leaving many aid agencies in limbo as they were told to stop work on existing projects while the U.S. audits foreign aid programs. Initially, senior diplomats in the State Department&#x2019;s Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs requested a full waiver to exclude USAID operations in Ukraine, citing national security concerns. However, an anonymous USAID employee told Suspilne that the agency was still ordered to halt its projects and spending on them. Employees don&#x2019;t have clear instructions on how to carry this out or if there are some exceptions, the source said. USAID is heavily involved in Ukraine&#x2019;s wartime needs and has provided over $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and $30 billion in direct budgeting support since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Already, some of the projects that USAID funds are pausing their work. Ivona Kostyna, the co-founder of Veteran Hub which offers services to veterans, said the organization had to close operations in Vinnytsia because of the directive. &#x201C;For our clients, this includes professional legal and psychological consultations, support in finding a job, educational and grant opportunities, personal support at every stage of their journey online and in person in Vinnytsia,&#x201D; Kostyna wrote on Facebook. The freeze has left hundreds of foreign aid contracts, valued at over $70 billion in the 2022 fiscal year, in limbo as a review process unfolds over the next 85 days, according to the Financial Times. Ukrainian officials and NGOs warned that the pause could jeopardize critical initiatives, including support for schools, hospitals, and infrastructure development. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that military aid to Ukraine is not affected, during a press conference with Moldovan President Maia Sandu on Jan. 25.	https://kyivindependent.com/suspilne-washington-orders-usaid-to-suspend-projects-and-funding-in-ukraine/	2025-01-26T08:36:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1697747096.jpg
I felt needed:' How the Invictus Games help wounded Ukrainian veterans adapt to life after war	On either side of a basketball court in Kyiv, prostheses of various sizes rest alongside piles of water bottles, as two teams in wheelchairs fiercely compete for the ball just tossed up in the air to kick off the game. The players &#x2014; wounded Ukrainian service members and veterans &#x2014; are training for the upcoming Invictus Games, an international sports competition for soldiers who have suffered life-altering injuries and sicknesses while fighting. Among those players is Valerii Odainyk, a sapper of the 93rd separate mechanized brigade &quot;Kholodnyi Yar,&quot; who lost his legs and some of his fingers in a mine explosion in January 2023. Odainyk is currently training to compete in wheelchair basketball and rugby, as well as sitting volleyball at the games this year, which are taking place in Canada from Feb. 8&#x2013;14. Ukraine will be represented by 35 participants at the 2025 competition. &quot;Given that my throwing hand does not have fingers, I had to adapt, which I more or less have at this point,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;On the court, we all feel the rhythm of the game &#x2014; everyone is passionate and energized. You feel the best after a good and friendly game.&quot; Valerii Odainyk, a sapper with the 93rd Separate Mechanized Brigade &quot;Kholodnyi Yar,&quot; who lost his legs and several fingers in a mine explosion in January 2023. (Invictus Games: Team Ukraine)The Invictus Games, created in 2014 by Prince Harry, has sought to create a community for service members like Odaiynyk, bringing people together through the games themselves and creating a larger network of service members who have lived through the experience of war. The Economist estimates that nearly 400,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been injured and are unable to return to the front line. After coming back from the battlefield or captivity, soldiers are often left to deal with their physical and mental trauma alone. As of July 2024, there are 1.3 million veterans in Ukraine, of whom nearly 80% are mobilized, Suspilne reported, citing the Veterans Affairs Ministry. &quot;Many people return from the battlefield and simply disappear. You need to feel needed so as not to get lost,&quot; Odaiynyk said. As the Ukrainians participating in the games train for their upcoming competitions, they say training and taking part in the games have helped them to adapt to civilian life, and learn to live with their injuries, both physical and mental. &quot;(The games are) a physical activity that restores the feeling of your body. To regain the ability to move, to control yourself and, as a result, to accept yourself &#x2014; this is the main goal,&quot; Olga Semenova, psychologist of the Ukrainian Invictus Games team, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;People really open up on the team. These changes are even greater than they seem from the outside. A person becomes more sociable and finds new interests. The participants then visit each other and communicate, even though they come from different regions,&quot; she added. Like other Invictus Games participants, Odainyk has already completed five training camps to prepare for the upcoming games, some dedicated to team sports and others to individual disciplines. Depending on their injuries, the participants work either individually or in groups. Members of Ukraine&apos;s team of the Invictus Games: Viacheslav Kaistro (L), Oleksii Prytula (C), and Oleksii Vasyliuk (R) in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Ukraine on Jan. 12, 2025. (Invictus Games: Team Ukraine)The Ukrainian team held its last training camp on the mountain slopes of Bukovel in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, as winter sports will make a debut at the upcoming competition in Canada. Odainyk, who skied for the first time while wearing prostheses, said the team skied all day with only a break for lunch to get prepared. &quot;It was scary to fall for the first time because you don&apos;t know how your legs will react, whether it will hurt. But after you fall for the first time, nothing is scary anymore. The fear disappears by itself,&quot; he added. When asked if he is ready to represent Ukraine in Canada. Odainyk replied with no doubt: &quot;Yes, 100%.&quot; Another participant this year, Alla Senchenko, is preparing for her debut in Canada, where she will compete in the skeleton. Senchenko said she has only trained in the basics of skeleton. The upcoming games in Canada will be the first time she completes a trial high-speed skeleton race on an ice track. &quot;It&apos;s scary, but I want to (try competing in skeleton),&quot; she said. &quot;Because life, like war, goes on. It&apos;s not for me to hide in a corner.&quot; Senchenko, a former soldier of the 2nd Separate Rifle Battalion of the Volyn Territorial Defense Forces, spent just over eight months in Russian captivity after being captured in Lyman, Donetsk Oblast in May 2022. Senchenko was recently demobilized and is currently studying to become a clinical psychologist. Alla Senchenko, a former soldier with the 2nd Separate Rifle Battalion of the Volyn Territorial Defense Forces, was held in Russian captivity for more than eight months after being captured in Lyman, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, in May 2022. (Invictus Games: Team Ukraine)After her release, Senchenko had significant health problems that she is still dealing with today. Captivity also left a strong imprint on her mental state. &quot;When I returned (from captivity), I felt it all. I&#x2019;m depressed now. &#xA0;It is a new challenge for me,&quot; Senchenko said, referring to dealing with her mental health. While undergoing rehabilitation in her native Volyn Oblast in western Ukraine, Senchenko learned about the Invictus Games and did not hesitate to join. The former soldier said she found solace in sports after Russian captivity, where the so-called workouts under the supervision of brutal guards were more like torture. &quot;Sport relieves at least some tension. You concentrate on your body instead of negative thoughts in your head. Someone says something nice to you, and you talk to someone. It helps,&quot; she said. Arsen Riaboshapko, a sailor in civilian life, was mobilized to the 77th separate airmobile brigade at the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Riaboshapko was wounded in a firefight in the Bakhmut district of Donetsk Oblast. One bullet went through and hit only the soft tissue of his thigh, while another hit his thigh bone. Following a series of surgeries and stretching ligaments in his leg through dreadfully painful physical therapy, Riaboshapko was driving in his car one day and heard an advertisement for the Invictus Games on the radio. Arsen Riaboshapko, a sailor in civilian life, was drafted into the 77th Separate Airmobile Brigade at the onset of the full-scale invasion. (Invictus Games: Team Ukraine)He was unsure whether to apply, as he didn&apos;t think his injury was &quot;severe enough&quot; to participate. &quot;I have all my limbs. I didn&#x2019;t think it was for me,&quot; Riaboshapko said. &quot;Often, you perceive such an injury as insufficient because society does not notice it either. It seems to be invisible.&quot; Riaboshapko changed his mind after joining the Invictus Games team and finding support among active soldiers and veterans. This year he is planning to compete in wheelchair basketball and rugby, sitting volleyball, alpine skiing, and rowing on simulators. He and his friends have also founded a non-governmental organization in Odesa that aims to help wounded veterans engage in adaptive sports.

(Invictus Games: Team Ukraine)&apos;You just become homebound&apos; The national organizing committee of the Invictus Games holds almost monthly training camps for those selected for the national team. The participants remain in touch with their coaches and psychologists beyond the camps. But for team members with serious injuries, life outside of the Invictus Games community can be isolating due to the lack of infrastructure for people with physical disabilities. &quot;You just become homebound,&quot; Odainyk said, describing the days when he uses a wheelchair in his city of Kamianets-Podilskyi, which has a population of 109,000 people. In 2021, the government approved the National Strategy for Creating Barrier-Free Space until 2030, which, among other things, aims to make the infrastructure of Ukrainian cities more accessible to people with limited mobility. The strategy is moving in small steps but still lags far behind the increase of people with disabilities due to the war. Members of the Ukrainian team of the Invictus Games, Viktor Dykyi (L) and Illia Pylypenko (R), in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Ukraine on Jan. 11-16, 2025. (Invictus Games: Team Ukraine)&quot;People do not understand the needs of soldiers returning from the front line. They do not want to understand,&quot; Odainyk added. &quot;There is a feeling that the state has used you, and then, you are no longer needed because you are different.&quot; Following his comeback from the Invictus Games, Odainyk wants to make his city community more friendly and comfortable for those returning from service. &quot;We are not from outer space; we are ordinary citizens,&quot; he said. Ukraine will participate in the Invictus Games for the fifth time. In 2024, a record 329 veterans and service members participated in the national selection process for this year&apos;s games. But the broader public still does not know much about this project, said Ilona Voloshyna, national coordinator of the Invictus Games. &quot;Veterans are the backbone of our human capital today. In the future, every second person in their family will have someone who served in the war,&quot; Voloshyna told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Of course, we want more people to know about the Games. Unfortunately, even when we visit rehabilitation centers, not all veterans know that they can participate.&quot; Caring for veterans and military families indicates how the state treats its army, Voloshyna said. If other soldiers currently serving in the military see service people and veterans being taken care of, they understand: &quot;Okay, if something happens to me, I will be supported,&quot; she added. &quot;One of the participants of the national selection wrote to us in the feedback: &apos;For the first time, I felt needed not only as a soldier but a veteran in my state.&apos; Before that, he believed that he was just used material.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/i-felt-needed-how-the-invictus-games-help-wounded-ukrainian-veterans-adapt-to-life-after-war/	2025-01-26T08:23:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/upd_P1149514.jpg
The week ahead: Key developments impacting global politics & markets	Editor&apos;s note: This article is an on-site version of KI Insights&apos; The Week Ahead newsletter covering events from Jan. 27-Feb. 2. Sign up here to start your week with an agenda of Ukraine-related events, delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday. The 9-year terms of three Constitutional Court judges will expire at the end of January. Failure to convene a quorum may force the Court to temporarily cease its activities. Ukraine&apos;s Constitutional Court has 18 judges, with 6 appointed by the President, Parliament and Judges Convention respectively. Two of the departing judges, Volodymyr Moisyk and Viktor Kolisnyk, are part of the president&#x2019;s quota; Viktor Kryvenko was appointed from the judges&apos; convention quota. If these vacancies are not filled promptly, the Court will be unable to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities. Currently, 4 seats are vacant &#x2013; 12 judges are needed to conduct constitutional proceedings (of interest, ex-head of the court Oleksandr Tupytskyi is on an international wanted list). On Jan. 27, the Foreign Affairs Council of the Council of the European Union will convene, looking to tackle pressing geopolitical issues, including Russia&#x2019;s ongoing war in Ukraine, with Ukraine&#x2019;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha attending via video call. Discussions will extend to EU-US relations, Middle East dynamics, and the latest developments in Moldova and Georgia. The ministers will likely address the renewal of sanctions on Russia, currently stalled by Hungarian PM Viktor Orban. The sanctions, set to expire on Jan. 31, require unanimous approval from all 27 member states. Orban has criticized the measure, claiming they harm the EU&#x2019;s economy, and previously suggested delaying the decision until after Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration. However, Trump recently indicated a willingness to impose additional sanctions on Russia if Putin does not engage in negotiations over Ukraine, signaling no immediate policy shift. EU ambassadors are meeting to seek consensus, but if no agreement is reached, the issue will escalate to the foreign ministers&#x2019; meeting. Diplomats warn there is no contingency plan if Orban continues blocking the renewal. The EU remains hopeful for a resolution this week to avoid further delays or disruptions to its sanctions policy. Later in the week, an informal meeting of justice and home affairs ministers will occur in Warsaw on Jan. 30 and run until Jan. 31. Discussions will offer a platform for Ukraine to strengthen ties with member states and seek support for its integration into the EU.

Russia launched over 1,250 bombs, 750 drones at Ukraine during Trump's first week in office	Russia fired 1,250 aerial bombs, over 750 attack drones, and 20 missiles at Ukraine in the last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan 26. The attacks targeted Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv, Donetsk, Kherson, Sumy, Kharkiv, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts. One of the worst attacks of the week killed at least one person and injured 45 in Zaporizhzhia after Russian forces pummeled the city with drones and missiles, hitting apartment blocks. Overnight on Jan. 25-26, Russian troops launched 72 drones. Ukraine&#x2019;s air defense downed 50, said the Air Force. &#x201C;Long-range capabilities are crucial. Sanctions are essential. Lowering the price of oil is important. The key is to act in unity and protect lives with resolve,&#x201D; Zelensky wrote on social media. In one of his first address since taking office, President Donald Trump threatened to leverage sanctions against Moscow as well as tackle oil prices that keep Russia&#x2019;s economy afloat. During his speech to the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos on Jan. 23, Trump said that lowering oil prices would end Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine &#x201C;immediately.&#x201D; He said he would ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to decrease oil prices. He&#x2019;s also pushed for ramped-up drilling for U.S. oil and gas which could also undermine Russia&#x2019;s fuel sector. A day before the WEF, Trump said that if a &quot;deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine was not reached soon, he would have no choice but to &quot;put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launched-over-1-250-bombs-750-drones-at-ukraine-during-trumps-first-week-in-office/	2025-01-26T07:45:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/air-defenses.jpg
Transfer of Air Force personnel to infantry continues despite scandal	The Ukrainian military command&apos;s plan to throw high-skilled Air Force personnel into the infantry was said to be halted when the practice gained nationwide attention, followed by a condemnation from the president. Soldiers, who spoke to the Kyiv Independent on conditions of anonymity, say, however, that nothing has changed, and the transfers are set to continue. Uninterrupted by the public attention that condemned &quot;a wasteful&quot; use of specialist troops, the Air Force leadership &#x2014; obeying the higher military command&apos;s orders &#x2014; is set to continue sending more of its men to infantry in waves, according to three different servicemen who spoke on the condition of anonymity. One Air Force officer confirmed that the transfer would continue due to poor mobilization results but said he could not officially reveal the figure due to the topic&apos;s sensitivity. Such transfers can have &quot;detrimental effects,&quot; he added, with some specialized troops, for example, providing aviation engineering services, supplying oxygen to aircraft, and replacing batteries. The transfer of about 5,000 to 6,000 servicemen from the Air Force to the Ground Forces began this January, though it&apos;s possible that about half of them would be moved next year, according to Ruslan Gorbenko, a lawmaker from the ruling Servant of the People. Another couple of thousand had already been transferred from the Air Force to the infantry since the beginning of the full-scale war, two Air Force servicemen said. Gorbenko, who is a deputy chairman of the parliament&apos;s Committee on Human Rights, told the Kyiv Independent that the transfer concerns the Air Force servicemen from rifle units who have experience shooting down aerial targets with firearms and are unconnected to aviation. The comment goes against the Jan. 14 video in which the aviation and technical personnel, who say that they have been fulfilling missions on Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets for over a decade, state they received an order to send &quot;almost all technicians to the infantry.&quot; Faced with heavy losses among battle-torn units, the Ukrainian military has been transferring specialized troops &#x2014; such as artillerymen, drone pilots, medics, and sappers &#x2014; to replenish the infantry, often causing a shortage in the now forcibly depleted units. On Jan. 14, a video featuring about a dozen Air Force servicemen surfaced online. In it, one reads aloud a message about what the group describes as &quot;a real challenge&quot; that could &quot;destroy the very foundation of our aviation.&quot; The Ukrainian military command was trying to transfer 218 specialists crucial for maintaining Ukraine&apos;s air fleet to the infantry when the video was released, adding to the 250 that were previously transferred, according to the speaker. The video prompted Ukrainian authorities to reassure the public that there are no such plans and specialists critical to aviation, air defense, and mobile fire units downing drones will remain untouched. An Air Force serviceman, who spoke on condition of anonymity fearing repercussions, said this week that about 120 servicemen from his brigade had been transferred to the infantry since January, which included signalmen, machine gunners, radio operators and those working with cryptographic equipment. The serviceman said he is worried that the transfer could leave Ukraine&apos;s air defense vulnerable, given some specialists tasked with detecting aerial targets, for example, were immediately thrown to the front line. Ukrainian servicemen of an anti-aircraft unit from the 24th mechanized brigade scan the sky for Russian drones and aircraft at a position in the Donetsk Oblast, on June 11, 2024. (Genya Savilov / AFP via Getty Images)He added that the command was sending recently mobilized troops in 2024 from the Air Force to infantry, but now specialists with years of experience are also increasingly being targeted. It would be &quot;a lot more difficult&quot; to defend the sky, this &quot;threatens the well-coordinated mechanism,&quot; he stressed. He estimated that over 1,000 Air Force servicemen nationwide had already been transferred to the infantry, but the number remains difficult to calculate as it is kept secret by the military command. Gorbenko said he was not familiar with the number of soldiers already transferred or which units they ended up in. &quot;Nothing has changed at all,&quot; the Air Force serviceman said from his base, where he says his comrades are randomly being sent one by one to the infantry &#x2014; with the main criteria being men in good health who don&apos;t have a right to be demobilized. Gorbenko believes that the transfer of men from the Air Force&apos;s rifle units makes sense because their job to shoot down the drones is becoming less necessary with the arrival of superior Western-provided air defense systems that do it more effectively. He explained that if these Air Force servicemen could shoot well, they would be helpful on the front line to alleviate the pressure there. The scandal emerged as Ukraine continued to struggle to replenish its battered infantry units following heavy losses. In a desperate bid to cover the losses, the Ukrainian military has often transferred troops from other units, such as artillery, tech personnel, drone operators, sappers, and medics, into the infantry in an attempt to hold on the front line in Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk Oblast. While the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces claimed on Jan. 14 that there were no plans to increase &quot;the acute shortage of specialists of the Air Force&apos;s engineering and aviation service who maintain aircraft to infantry units,&quot; it acknowledged that &quot;many areas lack infantry.&quot; It added that it is &quot;a necessary step&quot; to strengthen defense by reinforcing combat brigades with soldiers from other branches of the Armed Forces. The Air Force serviceman and the lawmaker&apos;s comments come after Ukrainian online newspaper Ukrainska Pravda reported, citing an anonymous senior Air Force officer, that Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi issued an order on Jan. 11 to transfer over 5,000 Air Force personnel to Ground Forces units. In an interview with Ukrainian TSN news program on Jan. 19, Syrskyi admitted that there is a need to cover the gaps among mechanized brigades. But he stressed that there is an order prohibiting the transfer of irreplaceable highly qualified personnel who have undergone training and who specialize in aircraft maintenance.

(Sameer Al-Doumy / AFP / Getty Images)&quot;Mobilization capabilities, unfortunately, do not cover this need (to replenish the battle-torn mechanized brigades),&quot; Syrskyi said during the interview. The reality of soldiers who transferred from one profession to another without any preparation is gruesome, as painted by their surviving comrades. The Air Force serviceman who spoke to the Kyiv Independent estimated that among the guys transferred to the infantry, about 40 percent were killed, and 40 percent were wounded in the first days if directly sent to the front, while some are still fighting. But, Gorbenko suggested that the casualty rate among the new recruits fighting for the first time is much higher than that of the Air Force personnel familiar with firearms that are being sent to mechanized or motorized brigades. Ukrainian and Western military experts were split in their opinions, with some arguing how the deep-rooted resource management issues are leading to the loss of experienced personnel, while others reiterate that some skills are less needed due to the modernization of equipment. The Air Force serviceman, who himself doesn&apos;t weigh the risks of being sent to the infantry because of his commander role, told the Kyiv Independent that they are ready to be sent to the infantry if needed, as long as enough time is given for them to gain the necessary training and for the command to find someone to replace them. The issue, he said, is that it takes necessary skills to replace the Air Force team that maintains aircraft, tracks aerial targets and shoots down drones.	https://kyivindependent.com/transfer-of-air-force-personnel-to-infantry-continues-despite-scandal/	2025-01-26T06:38:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1677406767.jpg
Ukrainian troops avoid encirclement in Velyka Novosilka, military says	Ukrainian troops avoided encirclement as Russian forces are poised to capture Velyka Novosilka, Donetsk Oblast, said the 110th Separate Mechanised Brigade. Ukrainian troops successfully withdrew from some areas to avoid being encircled but fighting is ongoing around the village, which lies around 15 kilometers east of the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. &#xA0; Equipment on both sides wears thin but Russian infantry vastly outnumbers the Ukrainian side, the brigade wrote on its Telegram channel. While Russian troops will likely capture the village soon, they will struggle to advance their offensive onward. The Mokri Yaly River creates an obstacle for Russia&#x2019;s advance and Russian troops are in a vulnerable &#x201C;fire pocket,&#x201D; said the brigade. &#x201C;Any movement is suppressed by shells and drones,&quot; said the brigade. The river also hindered supply routes to the Ukrainians. On Jan 23, Military spokesperson Viktor Trehubov warned that Ukrainian troops were at risk of encirclement. Russian forces are attempting to take control of access routes to the village through heavy fire, Trehubov noted. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 24 that its troops had planted a Russian flag in the center of Velyka Novosilka and that they had split the town in two, cutting off Ukrainian forces. The southern pocket fell most recently. Experts told the Kyiv Independent that Ukrainian troops were likely holding onto the village&apos;s northwestern areas and Russia expected to complete the capture in &#x201C;days.&#x201D; If they do, it will be Russia&#x2019;s first notable win this year. It is unclear how many Ukrainian troops were trapped inside the southern pocket in Velyka Novosilka, but it could be around two or three battalions, according to Pasi Paroinen at the Finland-based open-source intelligence organization Black Bird Group. The number of soldiers is probably around several hundred, he added. Fighting is at a very heavy level in Donetsk Oblast and Russian troops continue to advance, albeit slowly, this year. &#x200B;&#x200B;Throughout the fall of 2024, Russian forces made operational gains in southern Donetsk Oblast, including areas near Toretsk and Chasiv Yar, while advancing near Kupiansk and on Russian soil in Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-troops-avoid-encirclement-in-velyka-novosilka-say-brigade/	2025-01-26T05:37:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screen-Shot-2025-01-26-at-15_09_45.png
Russia bombs itself with 'smart bomb,' Astra reports	Russia dropped a &#x201C;smart bomb&#x201D; on itself in Belgorod Oblast, the Astra Telegram channel reported on Jan 26.The bomb, a UMPB-250, was found in a village in the Russian region but there were no casualties or damage. The UMPB-250 uses the same warhead as a Soviet-era FAB-250 but is designed to be &#x201C;smart&#x201D; and &#x201C;glide&#x201D; with a navigation module integrated with steering, antennas, and a turbojet power unit. Russia has frequently dropped bombs on its territory or the occupied territories in Ukraine. ASTRA counted 165 self-inflicted FAB bombs in 2024 as well as 13 this year. Moscow alters and upgrades its Soviet-era bombs to overcome Ukraine&#x2019;s defenses and increase accuracy. It uses glide bombs, particularly in relentless attacks on Kharkiv Oblast next to the Belgorod Oblast border, which are FAB weapons upgraded with a Unified Gliding and Correction Module (UMPK), allowing it to glide to its target. Russian forces are also improving the electronic systems for satellite navigation. The bombs are often equipped with Kometa antennas to stabilize communication signals and are more impervious to electronic warfare interference.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-bombs-itself-with-smart-bomb/	2025-01-26T03:36:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2086820870.jpg
Potential encirclement in Velyka Novosilka prompts questions about last-ditch withdrawal strategy	Thrusting forward with their vast manpower advantage, Russian troops are gradually penetrating Ukrainian defenses on the western edge of Donetsk Oblast and are close to capturing Velyka Novosilka. Located about 15 kilometers east of the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, the vital road-junction village was once home to around 5,000 people. It is now facing a similar fate to other Donbas strongholds, where Ukraine&apos;s delayed withdrawals resulted in avoidable casualties, according to military experts. Russian troops appear to have cut into the center of Velyka Novosilka, likely dividing the town into two and trapping Ukrainian troops in the south, according to Pasi Paroinen at the Finland-based open-source intelligence organization Black Bird Group. Paroinen said on Jan. 25 that the southern pocket appears to have just fallen, with Ukrainians likely holding onto Velyka Novosilka&#x2019;s northwestern areas and Russia expected to complete the capture in &#x201C;days.&#x201D; The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 24 that its troops had planted a Russian flag in the center of Velyka Novosilka and that they had split the town in two, cutting off Ukrainian forces. It is unclear how many Ukrainian troops were trapped inside the southern pocket in Velyka Novosilka, but it could be around two or three battalions, Paroinen said. He added that, given the dire manpower situation in Ukraine, these battalions were likely depleted, with only a few hundred troops remaining in total. &#x201C;The question is if it&apos;s closer to a thousand or closer to a few hundred, and considering how bad the manpower situation is, it&apos;s probably going to be closer to several hundred,&#x201D; Paroinen told the Kyiv Independent, adding that it is &#x201C;purely a rough estimate&#x201D; due to the lack of official information. &#xA0; Ukrainian soldiers of the 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade operate a 155mm American Paladin self-propelled howitzer in the direction of Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk Oblast on Jan. 21, 2025. (Wolfgang Schwan/Anadolu via Getty Images)Ukrainian military spokesman Viktor Trehubov said on Jan. 23 that the risk of encirclement persists for Ukrainian troops in the Velyka Novosilka area, as Russia is attempting to cut off routes into the town with heavy fire. He claimed that Ukraine&#x2019;s military has the situation under control and is working to prevent encirclement. &quot;Velyka Novosilka is currently in a difficult situation,&quot; Trehubov said on television, acknowledging that the town&apos;s topography, such as the narrow Mokri Yaly River, further complicates the defense. As Ukraine tries to hold onto the Donetsk Oblast strongholds, no matter how close Russian troops are to capturing them, more Ukrainian soldiers and Western experts are raising concerns about the cost of such decisions. Similarly to the situation unfolding in Velyka Novosilka, exhausted Ukrainian troops defending the town of Avdiivka &#x2014; located just outside Russian-occupied Donetsk &#x2014; were left behind in and around the town, multiple surviving soldiers told the Kyiv Independent in February 2024. Two soldiers from the 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade, which is currently defending Velyka Novosilka and facing a similar fate, have recounted how they had to leave behind dozens of their wounded comrades in order to increase their own chances of survival. If Russia captures Velyka Novosilka, it will be its first notable victory in 2025.

(Roman Chop/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Russian troops have been on the offensive for more than a year, capturing long-time Ukrainian strongholds in Donetsk Oblast, including Avdiivka, Vuhledar, Selydove, and Kurakhove in 2024. Elsewhere on the front line, Russian troops are gradually pushing Ukrainian forces out of the salient that they control in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. Meanwhile, the city of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast is facing another Russian offensive. Russia&#x2019;s imminent seizure of Velyka Novosilka comes about a year and a half after Ukraine began a counteroffensive in the summer of 2023, when it tried to liberate villages along the Mokri Yaly River. The furthest they advanced was to the village of Urozhaine, about 10 kilometers south of Velyka Novosilka. Now the picture is entirely different, with Russia reclaiming all the villages and threatening to advance further. Velyka Novosilka&#x2019;s fall could impact the situation in Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts, as only open fields lie beyond the village, according to Serhiy Hrabskyi, a retired Ukrainian colonel and military analyst. But he stressed that it took a long time for Russia to finally come close to capturing Velyka Novosilka, and that holding onto the village makes sense because it is exhausting Moscow&apos;s resources that could be used elsewhere. &#x201C;(Russian troops) are attacking only on one relatively narrow front line, this is the price of holding on,&#x201D; Hrabskyi told the Kyiv Independent.

(Genya SAVILOV / AFP) (Photo by GENYA SAVILOV/AFP via Getty Images)Russia has captured Vremivka, a village just southwest of Velyka Novosilka and then Novyi Komar, a village to its north, gradually cutting off supply routes for Ukrainian troops, Hrabskyi said. He stressed that the sharp contrast in manpower leverage has allowed Moscow to gradually advance despite the cost, and that it is &#x201C;impossible&#x201D; to prevent it. Russian tactics remain unchanged, relying on the continuous deployment of small groups of five to seven assault soldiers until enough troops are gathered to properly advance on a nearby Ukrainian position. They accumulate 20, 30, or even 50 people for certain positions, and it can last for weeks &#x2014; then this group moves forward,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Imagine being two people in a trench with 50 Russian soldiers storming toward you.&quot; Ukrainian troops should withdraw earlier to prevent encirclements, Paroinen from Black Bird Group said. He called the situation in Velyka Novosilka &#x201C;a completely self-inflicted situation&#x201D; caused by Ukrainian mismanagement. Either Ukraine&apos;s top military leadership is unable to comprehend the brutal reality on the ground, or it is &#x201C;way too slow at making these difficult decisions, like, for example, giving up a village,&quot; he said. &#x201C;This situation could have been foreseen for months,&#x201D; Paroinen argued, stressing that the Russian advance had slowed down for the past two months, possibly due to winter weather conditions or potential resource exhaustion. &#x201C;The situation has already been such for a week or so, ever since the Russians got into Vremivka,&#x201D; he added in reference to the potential encirclement. &#x201C;At that point, it was a done deal.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/potential-encirclement-in-velyka-novosilka-prompts-questions-about-last-ditch-withdrawal-strategy/	2025-01-26T01:53:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194550187.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 830,190 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 830,190 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 25. This number includes 1,720 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,868 tanks, 20,549 armored fighting vehicles, 35,124 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,323 artillery systems, 1,263 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,050 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 23,253 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-830-190-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-25T23:40:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1818488939.jpg
Donetsk Oblast to forcibly evacuate children from over 20 settlements	Authorities in Donetsk Oblast have decided to begin forcible evacuations of families with children in over 20 settlements in the region due to increased Russian shelling, Governor Vadim Filashkin announced on Jan. 24. Officials intensified civilian evacuations in Donetsk Oblast during the summer and autumn as Russian forces ramped up their offensive in eastern Ukraine. Despite these efforts, around 307,000 civilians reportedly remained in Ukrainian-controlled parts of the region as of early January. Due to the increased threat to civilian lives, Donetsk Oblast will begin mandatory forced evacuations of families with children in several settlements in the Komar and Kryvorizhzhia communities, Filashkin said. The evacuation order affects over 100 children. According to the governor, 76 children currently remain in the Komar area and 34 in Kryvorizhzhia. &quot;Now that the enemy has intensified shelling of Donetsk Oblast, people are suffering and dying every day, I ask parents to be very responsible about the evacuation,&quot; Filashkin wrote. &quot;Children should live in peace and tranquility, not hide from shelling!&quot; Some of the settlements under the evacuation mandate are less than 15 kilometers (9 miles) from the embattled city of Pokrovsk, one of the focal points of Russia&apos;s eastern offensive.	https://kyivindependent.com/donetsk-oblast-to-forcibly-evacuate-children-from-over-20-settlements/	2025-01-25T20:41:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2181224530.jpg
Ukrainian sailors return home from Houthi captivity	Three Ukrainian sailors held captive by Houthi militants for 14 months returned to Ukraine on Jan. 25, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) reported. The Yemeni rebel group captured the Galaxy Leader commercial vessel and detained its crew members in November 2023 as part of attacks on ships sailing through the Red Sea corridor. HUR and the Foreign Ministry announced the Ukrainians&apos; release on Jan. 23. The three sailors arrived in Odesa on Jan. 25, where they were greeted by relatives, the Foreign Ministry said in a Facebook post. A video of the return shows the sailors&apos; emotional reunion with their families. &quot;What happened today is the result of the well-coordinated long-term work of a large number of people,&quot; said Olha Mosyondz, a HUR representative. &quot;The special operation was implemented on the instructions of the President of Ukraine and thanks to the full support of the Royal Office of the Sultanate of Oman.&quot; Ukraine has led talks on the release of its citizens since the vessel was captured. The decision to release the sailors came as part of regional de-escalation efforts in the wake of the ceasefire in Gaza. The Galaxy Leader&apos;s multinational crew of 25 included sailors from Romania, Mexico, Bulgaria, and the Philippines. Authorities in the Philippines and Bulgaria have also confirmed the release of their citizens. The Houthis claimed they had captured the Bahamas-flagged vessel due to its connection to Israel, as the ship is associated with Tel Aviv businessman Abraham Ungar. U.S. President Donald Trump recently designated the Iran-backed Houthi movement as a terrorist group, potentially threatening efforts to de-escalate tensions in the Red Sea.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-sailors-return-home-from-houthi-captivity/	2025-01-25T19:25:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/sailors.png
Trump serious about annexing Greenland, aggressive with Danish PM, FT reports	U.S. President Donald Trump aggressively defended his plans to take over Greenland in a phone wall with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Jan. 24. In the weeks leading up to his inauguration, Trump has publicly floated the idea of a U.S. takeover of Greenland, Canada, and the Panama Canal. In comments to reporters on Jan. 7, he refused to rule out the possibility of using military force to seize Greenland, which he said the U.S. needs for &quot;economic security.&quot; In a 45-minute call that took place a few days before Trump&apos;s inauguration, Trump grew increasingly aggressive and confrontational when Frederiksen said Greenland was not for sale, senior European officials told FT. &quot;It was a cold shower,&quot; one official said. &quot;Before, it was hard to take it seriously. But I do think it is serious, and potentially very dangerous.&quot; Another official described the conversation as &quot;horrendous.&quot; Greenland is an autonomous territory of Denmark, a NATO member state and traditional U.S. ally. The Arctic island houses both Danish and U.S. military bases and has vast reserves of mineral wealth. Frederiksen reportedly told Trump that Denmark was willing to deepen cooperation with the U.S. on military bases and mineral extraction, but these offers did not appease him. &quot;The intent was very clear. They want it. The Danes are now in crisis mode,&quot; one official said. The White House has not commented on the call. The Danish prime minister&apos;s office said it did &quot;not recognize the interpretation of the conversation given by anonymous sources.&quot; Trump&apos;s expansionist ambitions and disregard for state sovereignty carry alarming implications, particularly for Ukraine as it fights to restore its territorial integrity amid Russia&apos;s ongoing invasion. Security analyst Alexander Khara, director of the Center for Defense Strategies in Kyiv, told the Associated Press (AP) earlier in January that Trump&apos;s posturing on Greenland bears echoes of Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s comments about Crimea. Russia illegally annexed and occupied Crimea, an autonomous Ukrainian republic, in 2014. The annexation was widely condemned by most U.N. member nations, including the U.S. Washington imposed sanctions on Russian officials involved in the occupation. A U.S. invasion of Greenland would disrupt the NATO alliance and undermine the Western coalition defending Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty against Russian aggression. &quot;We&apos;re in a time of transition from the old system based on norms and principles, heading to more conflicts, more chaos, and more uncertainty,&quot; Khara said. Russia has said it is monitoring developments regarding Trump and Greenland due to Moscow&apos;s own &quot;strategic interests&quot; in the Arctic region.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-serious-about-annexing-greenland-aggressive-with-danish-pm-ft-reports/	2025-01-25T18:25:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193292445.jpg
Russia's Ryazan oil refinery in flames after reported drone strike	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A fire erupted at Russia&apos;s Ryazan Oil Refinery after a drone strike overnight on Jan. 26, according to Russian media reports. The reported strike comes two nights after the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces (SOS) launched a joint attack against the Ryazan Oil Refinery on Jan. 24. Locals reported sounds of explosions and an attempted drone attack on the refinery shortly before 1 a.m. on Jan. 26, the Russian Telegram news channel Astra said. Ryazan Oblast Governor Pavlo Malkov confirmed that Russian air defense units were repelling a drone attack in the region. Andrii Kovalenko, the counter-disinformation chief at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, posted video to his official Telegram channel purporting to show a fire at the refinery after it was hit by drones. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims at the time of publication. The Ryazan Oil Refinery, one of Russia&apos;s largest, has the capacity to process 17 million metric tons of oil per year. Profits from fossil fuels fund Russia&apos;s war machine and Ukraine considers oil industry facilities to be valid military targets. Ryazan lies roughly 500 kilometers (310 miles) north of Ukraine&apos;s border. Ukrainian forces have targeted the Ryazan facility in previous attacks. An SBU source told the Kyiv Independent that at least three oil depots and a workshop were set ablaze in the Jan. 24 strike. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) also carried out a drone attack on the Ryazan Oil Refinery on May 1, 2024. Kovalenko said on Jan. 24 that the refinery is a key facility in Russia&apos;s military-industrial complex. &quot;The refinery plays an important role in providing fuel for both the civilian and military-industrial complex of Russia,&quot; he said on Telegram. &quot;It produces fuel for military equipment, aviation kerosene, diesel fuel and other types of petroleum products used in tanks, aircraft, ships and other equipment of the Russian Armed Forces.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-ryazan-oil-refinery-in-flames-after-reported-drone-strike/	2025-01-25T16:16:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/ryazan.jpg
Trump fires Defense, State department watchdogs in latest government purge	U.S. President Donald Trump dismissed 15 inspectors general, including those in the Defense and State departments, in a late-night purge on Jan. 24, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Jan. 25. The move is the latest action the new administration has taken in their first week in office to dismiss government officials and replace them with Trump loyalists. The mass firing targeted Cabinet-level U.S. agencies, with the exception of the Homeland Security and Justice departments, the WP reported. The surprise termination violates a federal law passed in 2022 that requires Congress to receive 30 days&apos; notice of any plan to fire a Senate-approved inspector general. &quot;It&apos;s a widespread massacre,&quot; one fired inspector general told the WP. &quot;Whoever Trump puts in now will be viewed as loyalists, and that undermines the entire system.&quot; Inspector generals provide oversight of federal agencies, investigating cases of possible fraud, waste, and abuse of power. Defense Department Inspectors General have played a role in tracking U.S. military aid to Ukraine throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. A delegation of watchdogs from the U.S. Defense and State departments visited Kyiv in 2023 and 2024 to hold meetings with Ukrainian officials. The inspections did not find any evidence of military aid theft in Ukraine. Certain U.S.-supplied defense equipment is subject to enhanced end-use monitoring (EEUM), meaning the items are supposed to be closely tracked. The additional monitoring requirements apply to weapons such as Javelin and Stinger missiles, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM), unmanned aircraft systems, and night vision devices. The firing of independent monitors, including those responsible for tracking military assistance to Ukraine, comes as Trump-appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio issues a 90-day freeze of most foreign aid, including support for Ukraine. Senior State Department diplomats are reportedly seeking an exemption for Ukraine-related programs, while Ukrainian officials have claimed that Rubio&apos;s directive does not apply to military aid. The future of U.S. military support for Ukraine remains uncertain under President Trump, who has promised to negotiate a quick peace deal and pledged to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the war. Trump has also used or threatened sweeping dismissals of government employees to advance his so-called &quot;America First&quot; agenda. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz began &#xA0;a full vetting of the National Security Council (NSC) staff, sending home dozens of officials, including those working with Ukraine. Reuters reported in November 2024 that the Trump team was also preparing lists of mass dismissals at the Pentagon. The purge of the inspectors general occurred on the same day that the U.S. Senate confirmed Trump&apos;s controversial nominee Pete Hegseth as Defense Secretary. According to the WP, Senator Elizabeth Warren asked Hegseth during his hearing if he would preserve the department&apos;s independent inspectors general. &quot;If confirmed, I commit to protecting the DoD IG&apos;s independence,&quot; he replied, according to a document seen by the WP. Hegseth has not commented on the firings. &quot;It&apos;s a purge of independent watchdogs in the middle of the night,&quot; Warren said in a post on X. &quot;Inspectors general are charged with rooting out government waste, fraud, abuse, and preventing misconduct. President Trump is dismantling checks on his power and paving the way for widespread corruption.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-fires-defense-state-department-watchdogs-in-latest-government-purge/	2025-01-25T15:06:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2195072233.jpg
Zelensky believes Trump can end war in Ukraine, must include Kyiv in talks	U.S. President Donald Trump could potentially fulfill his promise to end the war in Ukraine, but only if he involves Kyiv in any discussions, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. While the specifics of a potential agreement under Trump remain unclear, Zelensky emphasized that Russian President Vladimir Putin has no interest in ending the war. Trump&apos;s promise, made during his election campaign, to resolve the war within 24 hours of taking office was vague, and his aides have since indicated that such a resolution could take months. Zelensky insisted that the war could not end unless Ukraine is part of the negotiations: &#xA0;&quot;Otherwise it will not work. Because Russia does not want to end the war, while Ukraine wants to end it.&quot; He also expressed uncertainty about how a deal could materialize, noting that even Trump himself might not fully understand the details. &quot;I believe President Trump himself does not know all the details. Because I would say so much depends on what sort of just peace we can achieve. And whether Putin wants, in principle, to stop the war. I believe he doesn&apos;t want to,&quot; Zelensky said. Despite the lack of clarity, Zelensky believed that Trump genuinely wants to see the war come to an end. He mentioned that the situation, nearing its third anniversary next month, remains complicated, but Trump has recognized the risks of prolonging the war. &quot;He is simply saying this has to end or it will get worse,&quot; Zelensky said of Trump&apos;s stance on the peace process. Trump has indicated a willingness to engage in talks with Putin, contrasting with the Biden administration, which distanced itself from the Russian leader. Zelensky also emphasized the importance of including European allies in future peace talks, especially as Ukraine seeks to join the European Union. &quot;As for what the set-up of the talks will be: Ukraine, I really hope Ukraine will be there, America, Europe and Russia,&quot; Zelensky stated. Both Ukraine submitted its EU membership applications shortly after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, signaling their aspirations for closer ties with the West.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-believes-trump-can-end-war-in-ukraine-but-must-include-kyiv-in-talks/	2025-01-25T14:09:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164821112.jpg
Zelensky offers Ukraine as transit hub for Azerbaijani gas to Europe	President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Jan. 25 that Ukraine is ready to facilitate the transit of gas from Azerbaijan to Europe. Zelensky explained that he discussed this potential arrangement with Azerbaijan&apos;s President Ilham Aliyev during their recent meeting. The president emphasized that Azerbaijan has significant export capacity, with the ability to send up to 25 billion cubic meters of gas, and that Ukraine can provide the necessary infrastructure to transport it, though not Russian gas. &quot;There is gas, there are supply routes from Azerbaijan. The key is having the political will to work for your people, not with Moscow for some shadowy benefit, as some figures in Eastern Europe do, Zelensky said. Zelensky&apos;s remarks followed the suspension of Russian gas flows to Europe through Ukraine earlier this month, which caused dissatisfaction in Slovakia and Hungary, both of which had continued to receive substantial Russian gas deliveries. Zelensky, speaking at a press conference with Moldovan President Maia Sandu, noted that Ukraine was focused on providing quick solutions to the energy crisis in Moldova&apos;s breakaway region of Transnistria, where Russia had also cut off gas supplies. He stressed that Ukraine would not allow Russia to profit from the situation but was willing to support Azerbaijan, Slovakia, and other European countries in this effort. In December, Zelensky firmly rejected any renewal of the gas transit deal with Russia, saying: &quot;We&#x2019;re not going to extend the transit of Russian gas. We won&apos;t allow them to earn additional billions on our blood.&quot; His stance further complicated relations with Hungary, which has been a vocal supporter of Russia and has expressed concern over energy shortages. The issue is expected to be a central topic when EU diplomats meet on Jan. 27 to discuss foreign policy. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has warned that he will veto the renewal of EU sanctions on Russia unless Ukraine agrees to reopen the gas pipeline and allow Central European countries, including Hungary, to import Russian gas.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-offers-ukraine-as-transit-hub-for-azerbaijani-gas-to-europe/	2025-01-25T13:15:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1247343791.jpg
US diplomats push for exemption on Ukraine aid amid 90-day freeze, FT reports	U.S. diplomats are urgently seeking an exemption for Ukraine-related programs from a 90-day foreign aid freeze imposed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, according to documents reviewed by the Financial Times (FT) and sources familiar with the situation. The sweeping directive, which took immediate effect, also includes &quot;stop work&quot; orders on existing projects. Senior diplomats in the State Department&#x2019;s Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs requested a full waiver to exclude U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) operations in Ukraine, citing national security concerns. &quot;We do not know at this time whether this request will be approved &#x2014; in whole or in part &#x2014; but there are positive signals thus far out of Washington,&quot; an email sent to USAID staff in Ukraine on Jan. 25 read, according to the FT. USAID in Ukraine temporarily delayed issuing &quot;stop work&quot; orders to its partners, aiming to provide clarity while assessing how programs align with Rubio&#x2019;s directive to make the U.S. &quot;safer, stronger, and more prosperous.&quot; Despite this, by the evening of Jan. 25 in Kyiv, some organizations began receiving official &quot;stop work&quot; orders, halting operations until further notice from contracting officers. The freeze has left hundreds of foreign aid contracts, valued at over $70 billion in the 2022 fiscal year, in limbo as a review process unfolds over the next 85 days, according to the FT. Ukrainian officials and NGOs warned that the pause could jeopardize critical initiatives, including support for schools, hospitals, and infrastructure development. Military assistance to Ukraine, which amounts to $65.9 billion since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, remains unaffected by the freeze, a Ukrainian government official confirmed to the outlet. &quot;Military aid to Ukraine is intact,&quot; the official said. &quot;At least as of now, and it is certainly not part of this 90-day freeze.&quot; Rubio&#x2019;s order, however, excludes specific exemptions for Ukraine within non-military programs, unlike the approved waivers for Israel, Egypt, and emergency food aid.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-diplomats-push-for-exemption-on-ukraine-aid-amid-90-day-freeze-ft-reports/	2025-01-25T12:30:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2149305400-1.jpg
Zelensky backs Slovak protests as Fico criticizes opposition, organizers	&quot;Bratislava is not Moscow, Slovakia is Europe,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on X on Jan. 25, voicing support for protests against Slovakia&apos;s government. The demonstrations, held under the slogan &quot;Slovakia is Europe,&quot; swept across 30 cities on Jan. 24. Around 100,000 people nationwide chanted slogans like &quot;Enough of Fico&quot; and &quot;We are Europe,&quot; voicing opposition to Prime Minister Robert Fico&apos;s policies and pro-Russian stance, Slovak media Aktuality reported. The protests were also sparked by Fico&apos;s visit to Moscow in late December, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2014;a rare trip to the Kremlin by a European Union leader since Russia&apos;s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Fico reportedly criticized Zelensky for supporting protests against Slovakia&apos;s government. According to Aktuality, Fico dismissed Zelensky&#x2019;s comment on X as &quot;laughable&quot; and called it &quot;an inappropriate interference in the internal affairs of the Slovak Republic.&quot; He added that he currently has no plans to meet with Zelensky. Commenting on the protests, Fico accused the organizers of misleading participants and claimed that a third of those attending the demonstrations were allegedly Ukrainians. The Kyiv Independent can&apos;t immediately verify this information. Organized by the &quot;Peace to Ukraine&quot; initiative and opposition parties, the protests drew significant crowds on Jan. 24, including an estimated 60,000 participants in Bratislava&apos;s Freedom Square. Fico, who has been critical of Western support for Ukraine, accused opposition leader Michal Simecka on Jan. 18 of plotting to overthrow the government. Fico based his accusations on a confidential report from the country&#x2019;s intelligence service (SIS), which he presented in parliament last week. In a Facebook address, Fico claimed that Simecka was &quot;kissing Zelensky&#x2019;s ring&quot; and pledging support for Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership. Simecka, leader of the pro-Western Progressive Slovakia party, recently led a delegation of opposition lawmakers to Kyiv on Jan. 17 to reestablish Slovakia&apos;s support for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-backs-slovak-protests-as-fico-criticizes-opposition-organizers/	2025-01-25T11:02:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194890610.jpg
US suspends programs for entry of migrants, including Ukrainians, NYT reports	The U.S. Department of Homeland Security suspended a number of programs that allowed immigrants to temporarily settle in the country, including an initiative for Ukrainians, the New York Times (NYT) reported on Jan. 24. U.S. President Donald Trump previously pledged to impose harsher legislation on migrants and launch the &quot;largest deportation program in U.S. history,&quot; aimed at removing 15 to 20 million migrants from the country. The directive, seen by the NYT, calls for an immediate halt to &quot;final decisions&quot; on applications related to these programs while the administration reviews them and decides whether to terminate them. This decision will block the entry of immigrants fleeing &quot;the most unstable and desperate places in the world,&quot; including Ukraine, Cuba, Haiti, and Venezuela, among others, according to the media. Trump&apos;s administration officials also said that Trump believes that many of these programs were &quot;never lawful to begin with.&quot; Among the wide list of suspended programs is Unite for Ukraine (U4U), a Biden-era initiative that allowed Ukrainian immigrants to temporarily enter the U.S. if they had financial sponsors. Following the inauguration, Trump signed an order suspending the admission of foreigners who seek to &quot;illegally enter the U.S. via the southern border&quot; with Mexico. The Trump administration is planning to launch a large-scale immigration raid on major U.S. cities, according to the Wall Street Journal.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-suspends-programs-for-entry-of-migrants-including-ukrainians/	2025-01-25T08:42:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1996074507.jpg
Parliament committee head calls for defense minister's resignation as defense procurement scandal escalates	Anastasia Radina, head of the Ukrainian parliament&apos;s anti-corruption committee, on Jan. 25 urged Defense Minister Rustem Umerov to resign after he fired Maryna Bezrukova, the head of the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA). At the same time, the DPA and Bezrukova said that Umerov&apos;s decision was null and void, and she remains the legitimate head of the agency. Umerov has been lambasted by pro-reform MPs and anti-corruption activists for what they see as his efforts to destroy the independence of the Defense Procurement Agency, which was created in 2022 to make defense procurement more transparent and crack down on corruption. Anti-corruption watchdogs have also argued that Umerov&apos;s actions jeopardize Western military aid for Ukraine. On Jan. 23, the DPA&apos;s supervisory board unanimously voted for extending its contract with Bezrukova for another year. However, Umerov overruled the board&apos;s decision on Jan. 24, saying that he would not renew Bezrukova&apos;s contract as head of the DPA. He cited allegedly unsatisfactory results as the reason. But the Defense Procurement Agency said in a statement on Jan. 25 that it continues to operate under Bezrukova&apos;s leadership despite Umerov&apos;s statements on her dismissal. &quot;The DPA continues to operate under Maryna Bezrukova&apos;s leadership, as only the supervisory board has the authority to extend or terminate the director&apos;s current contract. This is in line with both the Ukrainian law and the latest version of the agency&apos;s charter,&quot; the agency&apos;s statement read. The agency said the planned appointment of a new agency head was a &quot;direct manifestation of pressure&quot; on the Supervisory Board and an attempt to destroy independent corporate governance. &quot;This is an unprecedented violation of all previous agreements between the Defense Ministry, civil society, and international partners,&quot; the statement read. Radina, head of the parliament&apos;s anti-corruption committee and an MP from President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Servant of the People party, said that Umerov &quot;must submit his resignation&quot; due to the scandal. &quot;The decision (by the board to extend Bezrukova&apos;s contract) turned out to be so independent that it outraged the defense minister,&quot; she said. &quot;... I believe these actions undermine the defense procurement reform and represent direct interference in procurement processes.It doesn&apos;t matter who will be in the &apos;new supervisory board&apos; or who will lead the agencies &#x2014; the minister has clearly shown that these people can be dismissed at any moment with the stroke of a pen.&quot; Radina accused Umerov of violating the law and failing to fulfill procurement contracts. &quot;The defense ministry of a country at war must be led by someone for whom legality, transparency, and accountability are not just empty words,&quot; she added. According to Ukrainian law, supervisory boards have the authority to hire and fire the heads of state enterprises unilaterally. This means that legally, after the board&apos;s vote, Bezrukova should take over the Defense Procurement Agency for another year. However, due to amendments recently made to the agency&apos;s charter by the Defense Ministry, which oversees the DPA, the ministry can reverse the supervisory board&apos;s decisions. Anti-corruption activists and lawmakers say that the amendments and Umerov&#x2019;s decision are &#x201C;unlawful.&#x201D; Following Umerov&apos;s move, the Anti-Corruption Action Center filed a complaint with the country&apos;s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) to open an investigation against Umerov on suspicion of alleged abuse of power. Previously, Bezrukova announced that she would continue to fulfill her duties as head of the DPA. Bezrukova took over the agency in January 2024, and her contract expires at the end of January 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-defense-procurement-agency-continues-to-operate-under-director-previously-dismissed-by-umerov/	2025-01-25T08:28:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/DSC01371.jpg
Zelensky, Sandu say they are ready to meet Transnistria's energy needs	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his Moldovan counterpart Maia Sandu said after their talks in Kyiv on Jan. 25 that they were ready to meet the energy needs of Moldova&apos;s Russian-occupied Transnistria region. Russian natural gas supplies to Transnistria were halted on Jan. 1 due to Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit, including supplies to Moldova, and Moldova&apos;s debt for gas supplies. Earlier on Jan. 25, Sandu arrived in Kyiv on an official visit to meet with Zelensky and discuss several issues, including the energy crisis. Sandu and Zelensky condemned Russia&apos;s decision to halt gas supplies to Transnistria, which has caused a humanitarian crisis. The presidents reaffirmed their commitment and ability to provide &quot;urgent and concrete solutions&quot; to meet the energy needs of the region&apos;s people, prevent further escalation of the crisis, and restore basic services. In their joint statement, Zelensky and Sandu also condemned Russia&apos;s &quot;unprecedented subversive activities and hybrid attacks&quot; against Moldova, recalling the Kremlin&apos;s interference in last year&apos;s presidential election and the referendum on Moldova&apos;s accession to the EU. &quot;These actions demonstrate a clear intention to systematically interfere in democratic processes to destabilize the region and undermine stability in Europe,&quot; the statement read. Russia&apos;s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom halted gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1 as Ukraine ended Russian gas transit through its territory. Gazprom said it had halted supplies because of Moldova&apos;s unpaid debt for gas. Transnistria had been effectively acquiring gas free of charge &#x2014; a political tool that Russia used to keep the region under its control. The breakaway region&apos;s debt for Russian gas amounts to more than $10 billion, according to Moldovagaz, a Gazprom subsidiary. Chisinau&apos;s separate debt for Russian gas supplies totals $709 million, according to Gazprom. However, the Moldovan government recognizes only an $8.6 million debt, citing financial audits. The end of Russian gas supplies via Ukraine has halted all industrial activity in Transnistria, Sergey Obolonik, the first deputy chairman of Transnistria&apos;s self-proclaimed government, said on Jan. 2. Transnistria&apos;s unrecognized government had previously rejected an offer from Chisinau to help purchase gas from Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-sandu-reaffirm-readiness-to-cover-energy-needs-of-russian-controlled-transnistria/	2025-01-25T06:47:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2153384608.jpg
Russia attacks Kharkiv with drones, local authorities report casualties	Russian forces struck the city of Kharkiv with drones on Jan. 25, local authorities reported. Russia targeted the city&apos;s Shevchenkivskyi, Kyivskyi, and Kholodnohirskyi districts, Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov reported. One of the strikes was carried out with a Molniya drone in the Shevchenkivskyi district, causing a fire, according to preliminary data. The attack resulted in civilian casualties and damaged cars. Russian attacks on the city have also disrupted water and electricity supplies in several districts. The damage caused by the strikes and the number of victims are currently being determined. Repeated strikes on the city are possible, Terekhov reported. Located less than 30 kilometers from the Russian border, the northeastern city of Kharkiv has suffered relentless aerial attacks over the past two years of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Moscow often targets densely populated neighborhoods with missiles and glide bombs.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-attacks-kharkiv-with-drones-local-authorities-report-casualties/	2025-01-25T05:35:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2114357693.jpg
US considers buying weapons for Ukraine using frozen Russian assets, Kellogg says	The U.S. government is considering purchasing American weapons for Ukraine with money received from frozen Russian assets, Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s peace envoy for Ukraine and Russia, told Fox News on Jan. 24. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 6 in an interview with Lex Fridman that he had proposed to Trump that Kyiv buy U.S. weapons with frozen Russian assets. He added that this could be &quot;one of the security guarantees.&quot; Zelensky did not specify what Trump&apos;s reaction was. This approach can be part of a comprehensive solution that will support Ukraine in its war against Russia and strengthen the U.S. defense industry, Kellogg said. The idea of directing Russian assets to the needs of Ukrainian defense remains &quot;on the table,&quot; Kellogg added. &quot;We&apos;ve talked about this repeatedly &#x2014; using Russian frozen assets to do that, to buy U.S. arms,&quot; he said. &quot;That is one piece of the puzzle that needs to be discussed, and it&apos;s going to be on the table with the president to talk about. But it&apos;s not the piece that is going to solve it. Still, it&apos;s an interesting point and worth discussing.&quot; While Western countries have frozen $300 billion in Russian assets, they can only access the annual income generated by these funds, approximately $3.2 billion. These profits will back a $50 billion loan to Kyiv, while the vast majority of the assets are frozen in European countries. The European Union recently disbursed &#x20AC;3 billion ($3.09 billion) to Ukraine as part of G7&apos;s $50 billion loan initiative. The EU&apos;s &#x20AC;20 billion ($20.6 billion) contribution to the program is partially funded by income from frozen Russian assets. The U.S. has also contributed $20 billion toward the loan assistance, showcasing a concerted Western effort to support Ukraine financially while leveraging Russian assets.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-exploring-possibility-of-buying-weapons-for-ukraine-using-frozen-russian-assets/	2025-01-25T04:21:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1247741520.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine injure 10 over past day	Russian strikes against Ukraine injured 10 civilians over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 25. Russian forces launched 61 drones from the cities of Bryansk, Kursk, Orel, Millerovo, and Primosk-Akhtarsk, and two Kh-59/69 cruise missiles from the Black Sea at Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down two missiles and 46 drones in Kyiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kherson, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, and Donetsk oblasts, the Air Force said. Fifteen drones were lost allegedly due to electronic warfare countermeasures. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 38 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, over the past day. As a result of the attacks, five people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. In Donetsk Oblast, one person was injured in the town of Pokrovsk due to Russian strikes, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Sumy Oblast, three people were injured in the Myropillia community, and one woman suffered injuries in the Hlukhiv community as a result of FPV (first-person-view) drone attacks, local military administration reported. Russian forces also attacked Cherkasy Oblast with drones, targeting critical infrastructure. Local authorities are assessing the impact of the strikes. The regional center is partially without power due to the attack.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-injure-10-over-past-day/	2025-01-25T03:06:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1489471985.jpg
Moldovan President Sandu arrives in Kyiv to meet Zelensky	Moldovan President Maia Sandu arrived in Kyiv on Jan. 25 on an official visit to meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky, according to her X account. Sandu&apos;s visit comes amid an ongoing energy crisis in Moldova&apos;s Russian-occupied Transnistria region. While Moldova has transitioned to European energy supplies, Transnistria remains heavily reliant on Russian gas. Russian gas supplies to Transnistria were halted on Jan. 1 due to Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit, including supplies to Moldova, and Moldova&apos;s debt for gas supplies. The energy crisis has been labeled by Chisinau as Kremlin blackmail and a threat to national security. &quot;I bring a strong message of support for Ukraine and its people. Their courage secures our peace,&quot; Sandu wrote on X. &quot;We&apos;ll discuss security, energy, infrastructure, trade, and mutual support on the EU path. Moldova remains a reliable neighbor.&quot; As Moldova has shifted toward European integration under Sandu&apos;s leadership, Russia has continued to put pressure on the country. Moldova has sought to combat Russian influence and pressure, banning Russian-affiliated political groups like the U.S.-sanctioned Shor party, outlawing broadcasts of Russian state-run television news, and blocking access to Russian media sites.	https://kyivindependent.com/moldovan-president-sandu-arrives-in-kyiv-to-meet-zelensky/	2025-01-25T01:42:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GiIBpMiX0AAwByZ.jpeg
General Staff: Russia has lost 828,470 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 828,470 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 25. This number includes 1,650 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,859 tanks, 20,545 armored fighting vehicles, 35,071 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,309 artillery systems, 1,263 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,050 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 23,213 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-828-470-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-24T23:15:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/LEM_33026-1.JPG
Pete Hegseth confirmed as US Secretary of Defense in tie-breaking vote	The U.S. Senate confirmed Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense on Jan. 24 in a tie-breaking vote. Hegseth, a combat veteran and former Fox News host, was confirmed with the Senate split 50-50. Vice President JD Vance cast the deciding vote, as three Republicans broke with their party to vote against Hegseth. Republican Senators Mitch McConnell, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins joined the Senate Democrats in opposing the nomination. Hegseth&#x2019;s role will be to lead 1.3 million troops and preside over a $850 billion budget, as well as to hold meetings with U.S. allies, acting as the principal defense policymaker and adviser. The confirmation came despite numerous allegations of misconduct, as well as questions about Hegseth&#x2019;s qualifications to lead the Pentagon. President Donald Trump praised Hegseth&#x2019;s appointment, calling him a &#x201C;great secretary of defense&#x201D; and dismissing the dissent as irrelevant to the &quot;important thing&quot; of securing a win. Hegseth&#x2019;s confirmation completes Trump&#x2019;s top national security team. Hegseth previously served as an infantry captain in the Army National Guard, doing multiple tours of Afghanistan and Iraq. He has previously called for reducing the U.S. commitment to the NATO military alliance and decreasing U.S. spending on foreign assistance. At his confirmation hearing on Jan. 14, he was asked about his position on Ukraine after he did not mention Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion during his opening remarks. &quot;We know who the aggressor is,&quot; Hegseth replied, adding: &quot;We know who the good guy is. We&#x2019;d like to see (the resolution of the war be) as advantageous for the Ukrainians as possible.&quot; &quot;But that war needs to come to an end,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/pete-hegseth-confirmed-as-us-secretary-of-defense-in-tie-breaking-vote/	2025-01-24T21:30:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193430534.jpg
SBU foils Russian missile plot on Ukrainian military institute, arrests cadet collaborating with FSB	An 18-year-old military cadet has been charged with treason for allegedly aiding Russian special services, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) reported on Jan. 24. The cadet, transferred to Lviv Oblast for training, reportedly communicated with a representative of Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB) and provided sensitive information in exchange for monetary rewards. According to the statement, the suspect transmitted data on the locations of military facilities, troop deployments, and the aftermath of shelling in the region. &quot;Law enforcement officers exposed her activities and prevented potential strikes on Ukrainian military positions,&quot; the statement said. She used a mobile messenger to send geolocations of training facilities and barracks, which were relocated from Kharkiv to Lviv following the full-scale invasion. The FSB allegedly planned to evacuate her from Ukraine to Russia via a third country after the completion of her mission. The cadet was detained by the SBU while attempting to send coordinates to the FSB and flee the military institute. During searches, officers seized a mobile phone and a laptop containing evidence of her collaboration. &#x200B;&#x200B;The SBU revealed that the cadet planned to provide the FSB with the geolocations of official university buildings where other cadets, including her classmates, were staying. She is currently being held without bail, and the court has imposed a preventive measure of detention under Article 208 of Ukraine&apos;s Criminal Procedure Code. The pre-trial investigation, conducted by members of the SBU Department in Lviv Oblast, is ongoing. The charges under Part 2 of Article 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine carry a penalty of up to 15 years or life imprisonment, along with confiscation of property.	https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-foils-russian-missile-plot-on-ukrainian-military-institute-arrests-cadet-collaborating-with-fsb/	2025-01-24T20:47:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/sbu.jpeg
Foreign Ministry rejects Slovak PM's unfounded Ukrainian cyberattack claim	The Foreign Ministry denied Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico&apos;s claim that Ukraine is connected to a cyberattack on Slovakia&apos;s national insurance company, according to a statement on the Ministry&#x2019;s website on Jan. 24. &#x201C;We categorically reject the hints of Ukraine&apos;s involvement in the cyberattack against a health insurance company in Slovakia,&#x201D; the statement said. The Ministry also called on Fico to stop portraying Ukraine as an enemy. &#x201C;We once again call on the Prime Minister of Slovakia, Robert Fico, to stop looking for imaginary enemies in Ukraine, which is friendly to Slovakia and the Slovak people.&#x201D; Fico made the allegation during an urgent press conference, offering no evidence to support his claim. Meanwhile, widespread protests against Fico&apos;s government are underway, and the opposition is pushing for a vote of no confidence. Protesters, which erupted in more than 20 cities, chanted slogans like &quot;Enough of Fico&quot; and &quot;We are Europe,&quot; expressing discontent with the prime minister&apos;s policies and pro-Russian rhetoric. The demonstrations drew significant crowds, with organizers claiming 60,000 participants in Bratislava&apos;s Freedom Square.	https://kyivindependent.com/foreign-ministry-rejects-slovak-pms-unfounded-ukrainian-cyberattack-claim/	2025-01-24T19:15:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188638934.jpg
Russia lost over 20,000 units of military equipment since Feb. 24, 2022	The Russian military has lost at least 20,027 units of equipment since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to an analysis by the Oryx project. The majority of these losses&#x2014;15,051 units&#x2014;were destroyed, while 852 were reported as damaged. Russian troops abandoned 1,113 units, and over 3,000 were captured by Ukrainian forces, the report says. Among the destroyed equipment, 3,704 tanks were affected. Of these, 2,635 were destroyed, 534 were captured, and the remainder were either damaged or abandoned. Ukraine has also suffered significant losses, with Oryx estimating 7,609 units of military equipment lost since the invasion began. Oryx compiles its reports based solely on photo and video evidence, meaning the actual losses on both sides are likely much higher. &quot;The amount of equipment destroyed is significantly higher than recorded here,&quot; the report notes. Since the start of Ukraine&#x2019;s incursion into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk region which began in August, the Russian military has reportedly lost over 3,000 pieces of equipment and vehicles, according to the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. The cross-border operation is part of Kyiv&apos;s broader strategy to disrupt Russian logistics and defenses near the border. The reported losses include 104 tanks, 575 armored vehicles, 330 artillery systems, 12 air defense systems, and 12 multiple-launch rocket systems.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-lost-over-20-000-units-of-military-equipment-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-24T16:35:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1247412452.jpg
Zelensky says Putin wants to 'manipulate' Trump amid talk of peace negotiations	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 24 that Russian President Vladimir Putin is attempting to &quot;manipulate&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump. Zelensky&#x2019;s warning came after Putin expressed willingness to engage in talks with Trump and praised the U.S. leader. Kyiv reiterated its opposition to any peace negotiations between Trump and Putin on the nearly three-year war without the involvement of Ukraine and European partners. &quot;He wants to manipulate the desire of the President of the United States of America to achieve peace,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address. &quot;I am confident that no Russian manipulations will succeed anymore.&quot; Earlier on the same day, Putin said that Russia is prepared to hold talks with Trump regarding the war in Ukraine. &quot;Regarding negotiations, we have always said &#x2014; and I want to emphasize this again &#x2014; that we are ready for talks on the Ukrainian issue (Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion),&quot; Putin told reporters. Putin also claimed that Trump&#x2019;s defeat in the 2020 U.S. presidential election contributed to the war in Ukraine. &quot;If Trump&apos;s 2020 victory hadn&apos;t been stolen, there might not have been a crisis in Ukraine,&quot; he said. Putin added that Russia has &quot;never refused contact&quot; with the U.S. administration and described his previous interactions with Trump as &quot;pragmatic and trusting.&quot; The Russian leader also referenced a decree signed by Zelensky in 2022, which declared negotiations with Putin &quot;impossible&quot; following Russia&#x2019;s annexation of four Ukrainian regions. Putin went on to question Kyiv&#x2019;s stance: &quot;How can negotiations be resumed if they are officially banned?&quot; Zelensky&#x2019;s decree came in response to Russia&#x2019;s illegal annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, a move widely condemned as illegitimate by the international community. Despite this, Putin continues to signal interest in engaging with Trump, fueling concerns in Kyiv about potential backchannel discussions that exclude Ukraine and its allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-says-putin-wants-to-manipulate-trump-amid-talk-of-peace-negotiations/	2025-01-24T15:32:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156503093.jpg
Rubio halts most foreign aid, including Ukraine assistance, Politico reports	Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on Jan. 24 new guidance that halts spending on most foreign aid grants for 90 days. This directive, which took State Department officials by surprise, appears to include funding for military assistance to Ukraine, Politico reports. According to a document obtained by the news outlet, the guidance requires staff to issue &quot;stop-work orders&quot; on nearly all &quot;existing foreign assistance awards&quot; and is effective immediately. The Kyiv Independent can&apos;t imemdiately verify this information. Rubio&apos;s guidance goes beyond President Donald Trump&#x2019;s recent executive order, which called for a 90-day pause on foreign aid grants while the secretary reviews them. The president&apos;s order left some ambiguity about whether already appropriated funds or Ukraine aid would be affected, but Rubio&apos;s directive makes it clear that no further actions will be taken to disburse funds for already approved programs, according to current and former officials familiar with the matter. The sweeping nature of the mandate shocked many within the department. &quot;State just totally went nuclear on foreign assistance,&quot; one official told Politico. While the document allows some exceptions&#x2014;such as foreign military financing for Egypt and Israel, emergency food assistance, and &quot;legitimate expenses incurred prior to the date of this&quot; guidance&#x2014;its broad scope leaves room for interpretation. It also states that decisions must remain &quot;consistent with the terms of the relevant award.&quot; Officials believe the halt will affect key allies, including Ukraine, Jordan, and Taiwan. One State Department official and two former Biden administration officials, all speaking anonymously, voiced concerns about the potential impact on these partners. The guidance could expose the U.S. government to lawsuits for unfulfilled contracts if the terms are found to be violated. However, the directive states that decisions regarding the continuation, modification, or termination of programs will follow Rubio&#x2019;s review. The omission of Ukraine aid is particularly concerning for American officials who see supporting Ukraine as essential to defeating Russia. While Republicans, including Trump, have long criticized what they view as wasteful foreign aid under Democratic administrations, Trump has recently intensified his stance on Russia. He has threatened Moscow with sanctions if it does not end its nearly three-year invasion of Ukraine and declared that &quot;Putin bears responsibility for ending the war.&quot; The guidance was reviewed and cleared by several senior State Department officials, including counselor Michael Needham and policy planning director Michael Anton. The department is now tasked with preparing a report within 85 days of the guidance&#x2019;s issuance.	https://kyivindependent.com/rubio-halts-most-foreign-aid-including-ukraine-assistance-politico-reports/	2025-01-24T14:29:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194097519.jpg
US arms exports reach record $318 billion in 2024 driven by Ukraine-related demand	U.S. military equipment sales to foreign governments jumped 29% in 2024, reaching a record $318.7 billion, according to the State Department. Countries ramped up purchases to restock supplies sent to Ukraine and prepare for potential large-scale conflicts. The Biden administration&apos;s final-year figures reinforce expectations of strong performance for U.S. defense manufacturers like Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman. Analysts predict their shares will rise in response to increasing global instability, according to Reuters. During his campaign, now President Donald Trump called on U.S. allies to invest more in their defenses. He proposed raising NATO&#x2019;s defense spending target to 5% of GDP, a significant increase from the current 2% goal&#x2014;a level no NATO member, including the U.S., currently meets. The demand for weaponry has surged due to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, putting pressure on defense contractors to keep up. Governments worldwide are submitting orders to bolster their military stocks, while the U.S. works to replenish its own supplies sent to Kyiv. The State Department described arms sales and transfers as &quot;important U.S. foreign policy tools with potential long-term implications for regional and global security.&quot; Notable 2024 deals included $23 billion in F-16 jets and upgrades for Turkey, $18.8 billion in F-15 fighter jets for Israel, and $2.5 billion in M1A2 Abrams tanks for Romania. Many of these orders contribute to the growing backlog for U.S. defense companies. Future quarters are expected to benefit from orders for hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, Patriot missile interceptors, and armored vehicles. Foreign governments procure U.S. arms through two primary channels: direct commercial sales negotiated with defense companies or foreign military sales coordinated via the U.S. government, often through Defense Department officials at embassies. Both methods require government approval. Direct commercial sales reached $200.8 billion in fiscal 2024, up from $157.5 billion in 2023. Meanwhile, government-facilitated foreign military sales rose to $117.9 billion, compared to $80.9 billion the previous year.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-arms-exports-reach-record-318-billion-in-2024-driven-by-ukraine-related-demand/	2025-01-24T13:16:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1246310076-1674684300r20al.jpg
Ukraine war latest: 'More than 50 explosions’ — Massive drone strike targets Russian refinery, plants	Key developments on Jan. 24: The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and Ukraine&#x2019;s Special Operations Forces (SOS) struck the Ryazan Oil Refinery and the Ryazan Thermal Power Plant in an overnight drone strike on Jan. 24, an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. The attack was later confirmed by the General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces. The news comes as Russia&#x2019;s Defense Ministry reported intercepting 121 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 37 in Bryansk Oblast, 20 in Ryazan Oblast, and 17 in the Kursk and Saratov oblasts each. The refinery, one of Russia&#x2019;s largest, has the capacity of 17 million metric tons of oil per year. At least three oil depots and a workshop were set ablaze, according to the source. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video that purports to show the aftermath of a Ukrainian drone strike against Ryazan, Russia, on Jan. 24, 2025. (SBU source)The statement confirms earlier reports in Russian Telegram channels that the Ryazan Oil Refinery caught fire after a drone attack. &quot;SBU and SOS drones also targeted an oil pumping station at the Ryazan Thermal Power Plant,&quot; the source said, without revealing details on possible consequences. Local residents reported more than 50 explosions, according to the source. Ryazan lies roughly 500 kilometers (310 miles) north of Ukraine&#x2019;s border. Drones also attacked the Kremniy EL microelectronics plant in Russia&apos;s Bryansk and other facilities in the city, the independent Telegram news channel Astra reported, citing Russian Emergencies Ministry sources. It is not immediately clear whether the plant, which produces components for the Russian military, suffered significant damage in the attack. The drone strike also damaged windows and the facade of a building of the Investigative Committee, and the Institute of Management and Business caught fire, according to Astra. Andrii Kovalenko, the counter-disinformation chief at Ukraine&#x2019;s National Security and Defense Council, also reported on the attack against the Kremniy plant. The facility has suspended operations after sustaining hits, Kovalenko claimed, saying that the plant produces microelectronics for Russian air defenses, Iskander missiles, electronic warfare equipment, and drones. This is the third time the plant was hit during the full-scale war, Kovalenko said. The city of Bryansk lies around 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Russia&#x2019;s border with Ukraine. The General Staff also confirmed the attack against the Kremniy plant, without revealing details on possible damage. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. Recent weeks saw Ukraine again intensify long-range strikes against military and industrial facilities in Russia&#x2019;s rear in an effort to undermine Moscow&#x2019;s ability to wage war. The Russian army is, for now, failing to outflank Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast in an attempt to cut off the town&apos;s logistics routes, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces, Viktor Trehubov, said on Jan. 24 on national television. The area near Pokrovsk, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian forces, has been the focus of fierce fighting for months as Russia intensifies its offensive in Donetsk Oblast. Russian forces are trying to bypass Pokrovsk from the north and south, but so far without success, according to the spokesperson. &quot;So far, these attempts have been more or less effectively repelled. They have begun to attack the town more actively with long-range, different types of missiles and FPV (first-person-view) drones,&quot; Trehubov said. &quot;Unfortunately, they are hitting the town, but their plan to surround it is still very far from realization,&quot; he added. The estimated Russian advance in the Pokrovsk sector in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 23, 2025, according to DeepState. Pokrovsk marked by a black symbol. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Trehubov stressed that the Pokrovsk sector of the front line is the primary vector of Russia&apos;s offensive. &quot;This is the main point of concentration of their efforts, and it has been for a long time. There is the largest number of clashes there,&quot; he said. Russian troops are continuing to push on the Lyman, Siversk, Kramatorsk, Toretsk, Pokrovsk and Kurakhove axes, according to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff. Pokrovsk and Kurakhove remain the focal points of the Russian eastern offensive, now in its fifth month. Ukraine previously blew up the No. 3 mine&apos;s shaft in the village of Pishchane near Pokrovsk to prevent Russia from deploying its troops closer to the front-line town, according to The New York Times (NYT) Earlier this month, Metinvest announced it had suspended operations at the Pokrovsk coking coal mine due to worsening security conditions and power outages. The BBC and the independent outlet Mediazona have identified the names of 90,019 Russian soldiers who died during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the BBC reported on Jan. 24. Since the media outlets&apos; last update in mid-January, the names of 1,964 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties. Some 23% of all those killed were military personnel who signed a contract with the Russian Defense Ministry after February 2022. According to the investigation, 17% of the identified soldiers were professional contractors, 17% were convicts who left for the war from prisons, and 12% were conscripts. The media revealed that nine generals and 500 soldiers with the rank of lieutenant colonel and higher were among the killed. As of Jan. 24, the highest casualty rates were among the residents of Bashkortostan, Russia&#x2019;s republic near the Ural Mountains and the homeland of the Bashkir people. Russia&#x2019;s non-Slavic ethnic groups have been overrepresented in its casualty figures in the war with Ukraine. The authorities and media in this region reported a total of 3,932 deaths during the full-scale war, the investigation read. Russia&apos;s real losses are likely higher, as the media analysis is estimated to cover 45% to 65% of the actual death toll, the BBC reported. According to the journalists&#x2019; estimates, the actual losses could range from 138,500 to 200,000 people killed. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 8 that about 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed during the full-scale invasion. The last time Moscow officially announced the number of soldiers killed was in September 2022, putting the number at 5,937. Ukraine&#x2019;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Jan. 19 that Russian forces suffered their heaviest losses last year since the start of the full-scale war, with total military losses reaching 434,000 soldiers killed and injured in 2024. This represents around half of the 800,000 killed and injured Russian soldiers since the start of the full-scale war, according to Ukraine&#x2019;s military. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry dismissed Russia&apos;s demand to cancel NATO&apos;s 2008 promise of eventual membership for Ukraine, calling it &quot;utter bul***it&quot; in a Jan. 24 statement. The response comes after Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko criticized NATO&apos;s 2008 Bucharest Summit declaration, calling it &quot;catastrophic for European security.&quot; &quot;Aw shucks, North Korea&apos;s ally issuing ultimatums to NATO. Utter bul***it,&quot; said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi in response to Grushko&apos;s remarks. &quot;Moscow has no say here.&quot; Instead, the ministry praised NATO&apos;s decision at the time and reiterated Kyiv&apos;s commitment to joining the alliance. &quot;European security architecture is built on protection from Russia,&quot; Tykhyi said. Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022 following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. While NATO members pledged at the 2024 Washington Summit that Ukraine&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; they have yet to extend a formal invitation. Russian officials, as well as Western intellectuals with a track record of anti-Ukraine narratives have repeatedly cited Ukraine&apos;s potential NATO membership as a justification for the invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged opposition from several NATO members, including the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia, but expressed hope that U.S. President Donald Trump could sway support for Kyiv&apos;s entry. There is little evidence that the new administration would be more open to Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership than former U.S. President Joe Biden. Trump has previously criticized NATO and blamed Biden for allegedly supporting Ukraine&apos;s aspirations and provoking Russia&apos;s invasion. U.S. President Donald Trump indicated that both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine&#x2019;s President Volodymyr Zelensky share the blame for the Ukraine-Russia war in an interview segment with Fox News released on Jan. 23. The U.S. president, who most recently met Zelensky in Paris in December, criticized his Ukrainian counterpart for resisting Russia at the start of the invasion instead of cutting a deal. &quot;Zelensky... shouldn&#x2019;t have allowed this to happen either. He&#x2019;s no angel,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I could have made that deal so easily, and Zelensky decided that &apos;I want to fight,&apos;&quot; he commented, adding that Ukraine has been fighting against a &quot;much bigger entity.&quot; At the same time, Trump acknowledged Ukraine&#x2019;s bravery in resisting Russia and said that the Ukrainian president has &quot;had enough&quot; and is ready for peace. &quot;We started pouring equipment... and they (Ukraine) had the bravery to use the equipment, but in the end, it&#x2019;s a war that has to be settled,&quot; Trump said. Already during his electoral campaign, Trump implied that his predecessor, former U.S. President Joe Biden, and Zelensky share blame for Russia&#x2019;s ongoing invasion and pledged to broker a swift peace deal. Trump has been often critical of the Biden administration&#x2019;s support for Ukraine and boasted about good relations with Putin, sparking concerns he might broker a deal unfavorable to Kyiv. Recently, the U.S. president has adopted a more critical stance toward Moscow, criticizing Putin for reluctance to cut a deal and threatening with economic repercussions if he fails to do so. &quot;Putin shouldn&#x2019;t have done it (launching the full-scale invasion)... and it has to stop,&quot; Trump said, claiming that Russia had lost around 850,000 soldiers while Ukraine lost 700,000. Zelensky put Ukraine&#x2019;s casualty rates at 43,000 killed and 370,000 wounded as of December, while Moscow does not reveal its losses. In the interview, Trump reiterated his warnings that if Russia does not agree to negotiate, the U.S. is going to impose &quot;massive tariffs and massive taxes, and... big sanctions,&quot; adding he &quot;doesn&#x2019;t want to do it&quot; because he &quot;loves&quot; Russia. The U.S. president echoed his earlier claims that the full-scale invasion would have never started if he were in office at the time, blaming the Biden administration for supposedly provoking Putin and allowing him to profit from high energy prices. Trump also lashed out against the former president for not pressuring European countries to donate more support to Ukraine, falsely claiming that Washington spent &quot;$200 billion more than Europe&quot; in support of Kyiv. The U.S. Congress has allocated over $170 billion to Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, which included the provision of over $60 billion worth of military support. The EU and its member countries have made available $145 billion in financial, military, and humanitarian assistance during the full-scale war. Ukraine recently announced that arrangements for a meeting between Trump and Zelensky are underway, while the U.S. president also said he aims to meet Putin in the coming days to discuss an end to the war. Moscow welcomed Trump&#x2019;s proposal for a meeting but voiced skepticism about a possible peace deal, saying it has to first understand what the U.S.&#x2019;s goals are before entering into any negotiations. Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters on Jan. 24 that Russia is ready for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump on ending the war in Ukraine. &quot;Regarding negotiations, we have always said &#x2014; and I want to emphasize this again &#x2014; that we are ready for talks on the Ukrainian issue (Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion),&quot; Putin said. Putin claimed that if Trump&apos;s 2020 &quot;victory hadn&apos;t been stolen,&quot; there might not have been a &quot;crisis in Ukraine.&quot; He emphasized that Russia has &quot;never refused contact&quot; with the U.S. administration and maintained a &quot;pragmatic and trusting&quot; relationship with Trump. He moved quickly to point out a decree signed by President Zelensky after Russia illegally annexed four Ukrainian regions, which declared negotiations with Putin &quot;impossible&quot; while leaving the door open to discussions with Russia under different leadership. &quot;How can negotiations be resumed if they are officially banned?&quot; Putin asked. Zelensky&apos;s 2022 decree followed Russia&apos;s annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, actions condemned as illegitimate by the international community. The move reflected Ukraine&apos;s refusal to engage with Moscow while Putin remains in power, underscoring Kyiv&apos;s position that peace negotiations must uphold Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak dismissed Putin&apos;s remarks, accusing him of seeking to sideline Europe in any talks. &quot;Putin wants to negotiate the fate of Europe &#x2014; without Europe,&quot; Yermak said. He added, &quot;Putin has long needed to return to reality himself, or he will be brought back.&quot; Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov echoed Putin&apos;s comments, saying that dialog with Trump could recover if the U.S. &quot;takes into account Russia&apos;s interests.&quot; &quot;If the U.S. under Trump takes Russia&apos;s interests into account, the dialog between Moscow and Washington will be gradually restored; if not, everything will remain as it is,&quot; he said. Lavrov expressed dissatisfaction with Trump&apos;s team&apos;s reported peace proposals on Dec. 29, particularly the idea of freezing hostilities along the current line of contact and transferring the responsibility for countering Russia to Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-more-than-50-explosions-massive-drone-strike-targets-russian-refinery-plants/	2025-01-24T12:02:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/2025-01-24-12_03_42-1.jpeg
‘An opportunity, not a burden:’ Ukraine House Davos’s message for world leaders, investors	Over the last week, Ukraine House Davos opened its doors to world leaders and investors for the sixth year in a row during the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. Ukraine House this year was adorned with the slogan &#x201C;Your Country First, Win With Us.&#x201D; The message set the tone for the discussions from Jan. 20-23, which focused on the benefits Ukraine can offer other countries in return for peace and economic recovery, namely lucrative investment opportunities. Throughout the week, the Ukrainian delegation highlighted Ukraine&#x2019;s estimated $26 trillion in natural resources and minerals, a topic that has picked up amid the return of Donald Trump, inaugurated on the first day of the forum. The new U.S. president has vowed to bring a swift end to the war, which could potentially usher in a wave of investment. The Kyiv Independent spoke with Ulyana Khromyak, Ukraine House&#x2019;s executive Director since 2023, as she wrapped up what she called a packed event. Khromyak said part of the delegation&#x2019;s mission was to convince investors to come to Ukraine now, rather than getting stuck waiting in line after the end of Russia&#x2019;s war. Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources provide a lot of investment potential, alongside the country&#x2019;s agricultural and defense sectors, she said. Ulyana Khromyak, Ukraine House&#x2019;s executive Director in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 20, 2025. (Ukraine House Davos)Regarding whether Trump will abandon Ukraine in its fight against Russia, Khromyak is hopeful the president can help achieve a sustainable peace in Ukraine and set the country on a path to recovery. &#xA0; This interview has been edited for clarity. Kyiv Independent: What was Ukraine House&apos;s key message and mission this week in Davos? How has this changed from the last few years? &#xA0; Khromyak: For the past three years, the messages were about what is needed to win this war, the opportunities in Ukraine, how Ukraine can contribute to the world, and why Ukraine is valuable to the world. Our message this year was a just and sustainable peace. We had a lot of discussions about how we can achieve this through strength on the battlefield as well as a strengthened position at the negotiation table. The second message was that Ukraine is not a burden, but a country of opportunity. We showed a lot of opportunities, including how rich Ukraine is in mineral resources. We have about $26 trillion in natural resources in Ukraine, out of which $12 trillion is in minerals. We also discussed the successes of the existing investors who are currently working under these (wartime) conditions and also the successes of small and medium businesses. The country is resilient, the economy is working. We talked about investment in the defense sector, which was also a hot topic, to make Ukraine a defense hub. We have the practical experience on the battlefield, as well as the technologies and the knowledge of how to scale this up. Kyiv Independent: Do you think that there is a positive view that President Trump could be beneficial for Ukrainian businesses and its economy? Khromyak: Yes, I truly believe there is. You can see this from his World Economic Forum speech. He delivered strong messages supporting Ukraine. Let&apos;s believe that his political will can help us strengthen these relations and achieve a just and sustainable peace as well as try to start the recovery of the country. Screening of Donald Trump&apos;s speech in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 20, 2025. (Ukraine House Davos)Kyiv Independent: One of the panels differed from the rest in that it focused on Russia&apos;s destruction of Ukrainian churches. Why is this an important message, particularly for Christian Republicans who have not always been supportive of Ukrainian aid? Khromyak: That&apos;s why we raised this topic. We see it&#x2019;s a hot topic for the Republicans, so we try to reflect this. We are saying that Ukraine is a country where we have a lot of religions and it&apos;s one of the most spiritual countries in the world. Different religions are very important to us. Freedom is our religion as well, but we also need to emphasize that we have a lot of (religious) persecution from the Russians. We showed a lot of videos about the persecution of religion in Ukraine. The audience said that this is an important message to the White House. &#xA0; Kyiv Independent: Ukraine House also lent a lot of attention to Ukraine&apos;s investment climate and resilience. What sense do you get from investors about their interest in Ukraine currently? Khromyak: There are a lot of possibilities to develop in innovation, infrastructure, agro-sector, and then definitely the minerals and energy sector. These sectors are very important for the world and Ukraine has all of these resources. We just need to increase their efficiency and therefore we need the investment for this to run independently. There were a lot of discussions about the frozen Russian assets as well; how we can unfreeze and invest them and efficiently use them to strengthen our economy. &#xA0; Kyiv Independent: Do you get a feeling that investors are taking Ukraine seriously as a place to invest? Khromyak: Yes, I do, considering the discussions that we had in the House. We had first Vice Prime Minister and Economics Minister Yulia Svyrydenko speaking, and her deputy was in the House as well, talking about war risk insurance. The government is supporting it from their side and that&apos;s why investors took it seriously. The investors asked a lot of questions about how they could invest, and what would be the security and guarantees provided to them.

(Stefan Wermuth / Bloomberg via Getty Images)Kyiv Independent: Has that changed since you&apos;ve been in your position since 2023? Khromyak: Yes, the interest increased. In 2023, no one knew what was going to happen. But right now, we have President Trump&#x2019;s messages and support from the leaders of the European Union. Right now we have no other option. We have no choice other than to win this war and to make the country stronger. &#xA0; Kyiv Independent: Do you get a sense that investors are willing to come into Ukraine now, or are they still talking about coming in after the war? &#xA0; Khromyak: We were trying to persuade them to come now and show the opportunities because everyone will be queuing after the war. There will be a lot of competition, so first come first serve. They will get better conditions right now, rather than coming after the war. We showed this deal of the year in the telecom sector, (the $1.5 billion Datagroup-Volia-Lifecell merger) saying that, look, the investors are investing and there are a lot of success stories, so please come and invest now. Kyiv Independent: Is there a clearer path now to securing war risk insurance? Khromyak: Yes. We work with Marsh McLennan, who was on the panel, and we had Aon among the audience. These are two main players in the insurance sector who are working with the government right now and with the investment institutions to provide war risk insurance. We have already had the first successes. The speakers discussed how to involve more people and how to make insurance for those who would like to invest now. The Aon and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) transaction that jointly provided insurance to the companies is a good development.

(Hollie Adams / Bloomberg)Kyiv Independent: One of the final panels discussed utilizing the frozen Russian assets. With some Western businesses lobbying against this idea in Europe, how much support do you think this idea has? Khromyak. We need the whole amount of the frozen Russian assets, not just the proceeds. Therefore we need the political will from different countries. A lot of people from the Ukrainian government, opinion leaders, and NGOs on different levels are lobbying for this issue. We are getting there. It&apos;s a long and hard path and a lot of countries still need to implement a lot of internal regulations to pass and transfer these assets. But we systematically need to work on this. The message is that we should not just accept the proceeds, but we need the whole $350 billion.	https://kyivindependent.com/just-and-sustainable-peace-ukraine-houses-message-to-davos-2025/	2025-01-24T11:59:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GV_09911.jpg
Enough of Fico' — Slovaks flood the streets in nationwide anti-government protests	Protests erupted in more than 20 Slovak cities on Jan. 24 under the slogan &quot;Slovakia is Europe,&quot; targeting the government of Prime Minister Robert Fico, Slovak media Aktuality reported. Protesters chanted slogans like &quot;Enough of Fico&quot; and &quot;We are Europe,&quot; expressing discontent with the prime minister&apos;s policies and pro-Russian rhetoric. Organized by the &quot;Peace to Ukraine&quot; initiative and opposition parties, the demonstrations drew significant crowds, with organizers claiming 60,000 participants in Bratislava&apos;s Freedom Square. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these numbers. Fico, who has been critical of Western support for Ukraine, accused opposition leader Michal Simecka on Jan. 18 of plotting to overthrow the government. In a Facebook address, Fico claimed that Simecka was &quot;kissing Zelensky&#x2019;s ring&quot; and pledging support for Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership. Simecka, leader of the pro-Western Progressive Slovakia party, recently led a delegation of opposition lawmakers to Kyiv on Jan. 17 to reestablish Slovakia&apos;s support for Ukraine. Fico likened the opposition&apos;s actions to Ukraine&apos;s EuroMaidan Revolution, alleging they were preparing to stage a coup in Bratislava. Fico&apos;s government has faced criticism for its perceived alignment with Russian interests, contrasting with the pro-Western orientation of opposition leaders like Simecka.	https://kyivindependent.com/enough-of-fico-slovakia-sees-nationwide-protests-against-pm-government/	2025-01-24T11:58:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2195089562.jpg
Ukraine’s weapons procurement clean-up at risk as defense minister moves to undermine reform	Ukraine&#x2019;s lengthy efforts to clean up its weapons procurement are in danger of being unwound as the Defense Ministry strangleholds the Defense Procurement Agency, say anti-corruption activists and lawmakers.Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Jan. 24 that he would not renew the contract of Maryna Bezrukova, the head of the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA), the body in charge of buying weapons for the Ukrainian military. He cited unsatisfactory results as the reason. Umerov&#x2019;s decision comes days after the DPA&#x2019;s supervisory board voted to extend the contract with Bezrukova after a year of reforming in this role. According to Ukrainian law, supervisory boards have the authority to unilaterally hire and fire the heads of state enterprises. This means that legally, after the board&#x2019;s vote, Bezrukova should take the reins of the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) for another year. But due to amendments recently made to the agency&#x2019;s charter by the Defense Ministry, which oversees the DPA, this, or any other decision of the supervisory board could be reversed by the ministry. Anti-corruption activists and lawmakers say that the amendments and Umerov&#x2019;s decision are &#x201C;unlawful.&#x201D; &#x201C;It seems like a violation of legislation, violation of the reform process, and violation of the independence of the agency that was promised personally by the defense minister and his deputies to our society, to our partners,&#x201D; Bezrukova told the Kyiv Independent after Umerov&#x2019;s announcement.&#x201C;Umerov is trying to attack the reform,&#x201D; she added. Maryna Bezrukova, the head of the Defense Procurement Agency in Kyiv, Ukraine, on June 19, 2024. (Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)Bezrukova told the Kyiv Independent that she would not leave the agency as she was legally selected by the DPA&#x2019;s supervisory board. &#x201C;I&apos;m not going to surrender. I will stand in my position until the end,&#x201D; she said.&#x201C;I have a vision for the institutional development of the agency. I have over 25 years of experience in procurement,&#x201D; she added. Umerov also removed the board&#x2019;s two state representatives, Taras Chmut and Yuriy Dzhygyr, claiming that they ignored the ministry&#x2019;s recommendation to not extend the contract with Bezrukova. He added that the board will be &#x201C;relaunched&#x201D; in the future, upending nearly a year of work forming the board.Umerov wants to replace Bezrukova with Arsen Zhumadilov, the director of the State Rear Operator (known under its Ukrainian acronym DOT) which buys food and clothes for the military. Previously, Umerov tried to merge the DPA with DOT into one unified body under Zhumadilov&apos;s leadership. Umerov and Zhumadilov are close, sources told the Kyiv Independent. Umerov claimed the reason for the replacement was that DOT delivered better results. Following Umerov&#x2019;s announcement, Ukrainian anti-corruption activists have called for his dismissal, saying that he is disrupting the key reform for wartime Ukraine. &#x201C;These decisions of the minister are a clear sabotage and undermining of the country&apos;s defense capability,&#x201D; Vitaliy Shabunin, the co-founder of the Anti-Corruption Action Center (ANTAC), wrote on Facebook. Additionally, Umerov proposed to fire Deputy Defense Minister Dmytro Klimenkov, who he said &#x201C;failed&#x201D; the task of defense procurement. The ministry set out to reform defense procurement after several high-profile corruption scandals emerged in 2023. Umerov brought Bezrukova on board in January 2024 to lead the transformation of the DPA. Her main goal was to move to direct contracting with weapons producers that cut out middlemen who mark up prices or even fail to deliver on deals. One of the central pieces of the reform was the creation of an independent supervisory board that could protect the agency from political pressure and help ensure fair procurement. However, Bezrukova has locked horns with the ministry multiple times while attempting to change the DPA&#x2019;s practices. In July, the Kyiv Independent reported that she was facing pressure from arms dealers who were unhappy with her reforms. Bezrukova took over the DPA amid reforms in the defense procurement sector which was littered with scandals. Under the agency&#x2019;s previous head, Volodymyr Pikuzo, nearly all defense procurement contracts were through intermediaries, and dodgy contracts cost Ukraine tens of billions of hryvnia, according to Bezrukova, as well as delays of essential battlefield supplies.Bezrukova sees the agency as &#x201C;a platform&#x201D; between the army and defense companies. In the last year, she has secured over 50 direct contracts from 13 countries for ammunition, missiles, radars, drones, and artillery systems under a total annual budget of Hr 306 billion ($7.3 billion). Of the contracts last year, 61% were signed with Ukrainian companies, 27% with foreign companies, including major defense firms like Rheinmetall and KNDS, and 12% with intermediaries. Both the DPA and the DOT, the agency in charge of food and clothes purchases, are performing &#x201C;much better&#x201D; than when the Defense Ministry was in charge of procurement, said Anastasia Radina, lawmaker and head of the parliament&apos;s anti-corruption committee. Bezrukova took the role with the understanding that a supervisory board would be introduced, as is standard practice across state institutions. After facing pressure early on, she hoped the board would protect her, but it took nearly a year into her employment for it to be formed. In the meantime, while the DPA was being overseen by the Defense Ministry, Bezrukova and the ministry repeatedly butted heads. At the start of her job, Bezrukova said Deputy Defense Minister Klimenkov insisted she sign a contract for a large supply of shells despite her concerns about the manufacturer, owned by state defense conglomerate Ukroboronprom. (Editor&#x2019;s Note: The manufacturer&#x2019;s name is not mentioned for security reasons.) Dmytro Klimenkov, deputy defense minister of Ukraine, talks to The Kyiv Independent on Feb. 22, 2024. (Press Service/Defense Ministry of Ukraine) The company&#x2019;s capacities were too limited to produce the proposed 500,000 shells, due to a lack of workers and a gunpowder deficit, Bezrukova said. Additionally, at the time when the contract was being considered in February 2024, the company&#x2019;s director and a manager were under two separate investigations for inflating prices, the National Anti-corruption Bureau (NABU) told the Kyiv Independent.An initial ministry inspection of the manufacturer confirmed Bezrukova&#x2019;s fears, noting that its production capacity was likely around 300-350,000 shells. But a few weeks later, the ministry inspector changed their mind, claiming that the company had enough capacity, according to Bezrukova. Despite concerns, Bezrukova signed the contract.In the summer, the company was behind schedule. Bezrukova told Ukrainska Pravda, a Ukrainian media outlet, that Klimenkov asked her to extend the deadline for deliveries but she refused, insisting they should start looking for alternatives. It was at this point that her relationship with the ministry&#x2019;s top brass went sour, she said. The Kyiv Independent requested a comment from the Defense Ministry but hasn&#x2019;t received a response.By November, the shells were on the front line but many were failing to explode. Around 24,000 duds were withdrawn in December, leaving authorities clambering to find alternatives. On Nov. 26, the Defense Ministry said it was investigating the incident and would deliver imported shells instead.In another more recent clash, the ministry abruptly transferred Hr 23 billion ($546 million) from the DPA&#x2019;s budget to the State Border Guard Service on Nov. 29, without forewarning Bezrukova. The Defense Ministry and Armed Forces General Staff claimed that the DPA had over Hr 100 billion in unused funds that needed to be spent before the end of the year. However, the agency said that this blurred the truth. On Nov. 25, the alleged unused funds consisted of Hr 45 billion available for contracting and Hr 57 billion set aside for pre-agreed contracts. But by Nov. 29, the agency had lined up more contracts for 2025 and the remaining funds dropped to Hr 21.8 billion. That same day, the government adopted the order to redistribute the Hr 23 billion and the DPA had to take Hr 1.2 billion from already concluded contracts to meet it. A furious Bezrukova called for the money to be returned but it hasn&#x2019;t been, according to the DPA.The State Border Guard Service planned to spend the money on a contract with a reportedly dodgy Polish intermediary company PHU Lechmar for mines and shells for the army. The intermediary asked for a 100% prepayment, sounding alarm bells for Bezrukova who says she never pays more than 50% upfront. &#x201C;This is extremely risky,&#x201D; said Bezrukova, adding that if Lechmar fails to deliver on the contract, there is no way to get the money back. Assembling the supervisory board &#x2014; which is now to be &#x201C;relaunched&#x201D; &#x2014; has been a long process, marked by tension between Umerov and Klimenkov on one side, and Bezrukova and anti-corruption activists, supported by Ukraine&#x2019;s Western partners, on the other. The board was supposed to strengthen the agency and defend its head from illicit pressure. While the ministry announced the shortlist of the DPA&#x2019;s supervisory board candidates in June, it took almost six months for the board to come together. Bezrukova sees the delay as a deliberate attempt by the Defense Ministry to undermine the process, or an inability to do its job well. Two board members, Taras Chmut and Kateryna Kuznetsova, told the Kyiv Independent that the process was fraught with bureaucratic hurdles, although they did not find it unusual. Chmut, who leads the Come Back Alive NGO that raises funds and buys weapons for the army, noted that Ukrainian bureaucracy is often a tedious process with endless paperwork. But according to Radina, a lawmaker, the holdup was not justified. While the process was dragging on, Umerov suddenly announced he wanted to merge the DPA with DOT in September 2024. The merger would see one agency dealing with both non-lethal and lethal aid under one supervisory board. Had it been successful, the supervisory board process would have been dragged out again, wasting time and money to rebuild the entire bureaucratic system like the financial budget and workflow. Umerov was trying to &#x201C;destroy&#x201D; the DPA, said Shabunin, the co-founder of the Anti-Corruption Action Center (ANTAC). Instead of Bezrukova, Umerov wanted the director of DOT, Zhumadilov, to head the unified agency as the two men have a closer relationship, several sources told the Kyiv Independent. Vitaly Shabunin, head of the Anti-Corruption Action Center&#x2019;s executive board, speaks at the Ukrainian school of political studies in Kyiv, Ukraine on Sept. 26, 2019. (Ukrainian school of political studies / Facebook)DOT operates with a much smaller budget and staff and doesn&#x2019;t deal with import contracts while the DPA does. Merging the two agencies for them to be led by DOT &#x201C;does not make sense,&#x201D; Shabunin said. &#x201C;It&apos;s a huge difference to buy food, which DOT does, and to buy weapons. The weapons market is much more complicated,&#x201D; he added. Umerov initially said the merger would bring Ukraine in line with NATO standards. However, the plan was swiftly rebuked by the Alliance who backed keeping the two agencies separate. Umerov U-turned on his proposal, saying the two agencies would remain independent during the war. &#x201C;It was not logical,&#x201D; Bezrukova said. &#x201C;In NATO recommendations, it clearly mentions that there are two agencies and that the Defense Ministry should develop and support the capacity of these two agencies, especially of the DPA.&#x201D; Just a day before the supervisory board was finally supposed to be officially formed on Dec. 17, the ministry made amendments to the DPA&#x2019;s charter, undermining its authority. According to Radina, the timing looks suspicious. The ministry also changed DOT&#x2019;s charter but did so months prior. &#x201C;It definitely seems connected to the decision to finally form a supervisory board, to immediately render its powers questionable,&#x201D; she said. Shortly after the ministry&#x2019;s decision, the board members published a statement that the changes &#x201C;restrict the board&apos;s independence and create preconditions for interference in its activities.&#x201D; Bezrukova was keen to stay on at the agency, planning to zero in on the quality and reliability of suppliers. She also hoped to bring the DPA closer in line with NATO agencies and have more autonomy from the Defense Ministry. The supervisory board wanted Bezrukova to stay too. The board voted to extend Bezrukova&#x2019;s contract for another year &#x201C;based on the need to ensure stability and efficiency in procurement management in wartime.&#x201D; Additionally, the board also suggested NATO&#x2019;s auditing board (IBAN) carry out an independent audit. &#x201C;The state must move to transparent rules of the game: purchasing what the army really needs, when it is needed, and at fair prices,&#x201D; Chmut wrote on Facebook after the announcement on Jan. 20. According to the amended DPA charter, the ministry can &#x201C;disagree&#x201D; with the board&#x2019;s decisions and push back.In the long run, Radina is concerned about the broad wording of the amendments, which may allow the ministry to give obligatory orders to the DPA&#x2019;s employees and even intervene in the procurement process, circumventing the agency&#x2019;s leadership and procurement procedures.

Incoming Trump peace envoy suggests oil crackdown to push Russia to negotiate	Stricter measures targeting Russia&apos;s oil industry could pressure the Kremlin to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, incoming peace envoy for U.S. President Donald Trump, told FOX News on Jan. 24. The proposal comes as Trump threatens to impose sanctions and tariffs on Russian exports if no deal to end the war is reached soon. &quot;Russia is earning billions from oil sales,&quot; Kellogg said, emphasizing that battlefield victories alone are unlikely to force Russia to end the war. Kellogg argued that reducing Russia&apos;s oil revenues to $45 per barrel, its breakeven point, could weaken Moscow&apos;s financial resilience and force it to seek a settlement. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed on Jan. 24 that Russia is ready for talks with Trump, whom he described as having a &quot;pragmatic and trusting&quot; relationship with Moscow. Reuters reported on Jan. 23 that Putin is increasingly concerned about the country&apos;s economy, citing five undisclosed sources. Throughout the war, Ukraine&apos;s Western allies have imposed significant sanctions aimed at crippling Russia&apos;s ability to sustain its military aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/incoming-trump-peace-envoy-suggests-oil-crackdown-to-push-russia-to-negotiate/	2025-01-24T10:52:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1242112038.jpg
Ukraine to boost energy resilience with focus on distributed generation, PM says	Ukraine is ramping up efforts to strengthen its energy resilience through the development of distributed generation and increased domestic gas production, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on Jan. 24. The government plans to commission nearly 900 megawatts (MW) of distributed generation facilities this year, part of a broader effort to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s energy sector amid ongoing Russian strikes targeting critical infrastructure. Shmyhal said that in 2024, 233 generating units with a total capacity of over 830 MW were connected, including gas turbines, pistons, and cogeneration units. &quot;In order to strengthen and develop our energy sector, we are also investing in increasing Ukrainian gas production,&quot; he added. Repairs and reconstruction of the Ukrainian energy sector are ongoing, the prime minister added. &quot;About 4 gigawatts (GW) of thermal and hydropower capacity was restored in 2024,&quot; he said, &quot;this year, it is planned to restore about 3 GW more.&quot; Under martial law, the government has exempted energy equipment imports from value-added tax to support the restoration and creation of new distributed generation facilities. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure, including a Jan. 15 attack that targeted facilities at one of the largest natural gas storage sites in Lviv Oblast. President Volodymyr Zelensky noted the timing and intent of the strikes, writing, &quot;It&apos;s the middle of winter, and Russia&apos;s goal remains the same: our energy sector.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-boost-energy-resilience-with-focus-on-distributed-generation-pm-says/	2025-01-24T10:01:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1601918605.jpg
What leverage does Trump have over Putin in peace negotiations? Quite a lot, experts say	Only days after U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House, he dialed up the heat on Russia with a threat of sanctions, tariffs, and negotiating &quot;the hard way&quot; if Russian President Vladimir Putin fails to come to the table for a peace deal with Ukraine. Trump has repeatedly promised to push for a swift peace settlement once in office, prompting fears from some that he might pressure Kyiv towards painful concessions or &#x2014; at worst &#x2014; what would amount to a surrender. His recent comments, however, suggest that Trump could be ready to take a hard line with Russia. &quot;In negotiations, it&#x2019;s about who needs a deal the most,&quot; says Timothy Ash, an associate fellow at the Chatham House&apos;s Russia and Eurasia Program. &quot;I think the leverage is with Trump, not Putin.&quot; Trump has leverage in economic, military, and diplomatic terms &#x2014; &#xA0;the main question is his willingness to use it. Russia&#x2019;s economy is showing signs of weakness, making Putin more vulnerable than ever to additional economic pressure like sanctions. Ramped-up support for Ukraine on the battlefield could add to Russia&#x2019;s mounting losses and further incentivize dealmaking, as would uniting support among allies and squeezing Russia on the diplomatic stage. &quot;A long war doesn&#x2019;t hurt Trump very much. There&apos;s no huge cost to the U.S. economy. No U.S. lives are in danger,&quot; said Ash, adding that a large portion of U.S. military aid has been reinvested in its domestic defense industry. &quot;Trump can carry on, whereas for Putin, it just gets more difficult for him the longer it goes.&quot; The Trump administration is already signaling that sanctions are at the forefront of their negotiating plans with Russia. &quot;If a deal is not reached, I will have no other choice but to put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries,&quot; Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social Jan. 22. Earlier in the month, Bloomberg reported that the administration has begun forming its sanctions strategy and will likely take one of two approaches: offering targeted relief to Russian oil producers to incentivize negotiations or significantly expanding sanctions to ramp up pressure. Sanctions are &quot;the best leverage we have,&quot; said Edward Fishman, a senior research scholar at Columbia University&#x2019;s Center on Global Energy Policy and author of the forthcoming book &quot;Chokepoints: American Power in the Age of Economic Warfare.&quot; While the Group of Seven countries and the previous U.S. administration under President Joe Biden imposed heavy economic sanctions on Russia shortly after the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, they included significant carve-outs aimed at not disrupting the global energy markets. After a contraction in 2022, aggressive defense spending contributed to Russia&#x2019;s economic growth for the past two years, suggesting the effect of the sanctions has reduced after Russia&#x2019;s economy adjusted and discovered workarounds. But Russia&#x2019;s economy is now showing cracks, said Fishman, and, &quot;in the last 10 days of the Biden administration, the U.S. imposed pretty significant sanctions on Russia&apos;s oil and gas sector that meaningfully enhanced the pressure on Russia&apos;s economy.&quot; The last-minute sanctions from the outgoing administration are likely intended to provide Trump with a strong negotiating hand in future talks. The new sanctions close many of the energy loopholes and could reduce Russian oil exports by between half a million and a million barrels per day in the short term.

(Contributor / Getty Images)&quot;Russia&#x2019;s economy is not doing very well,&quot; Fishman said, pointing to projections of stalled growth in 2025 and high inflation and interest rates. &quot;Turning up the heat now even more on Russia could really be what we need to get Russia to negotiate.&quot; A powerful sanctions strategy will first require convincing Putin that the U.S. has no plans to reduce current sanctions or enforcement, said Fishman, so Russia can&#x2019;t just wait them out. There are many other sanction targets available to Trump if he wants to up the pressure ahead of negotiations, Fishman also noted. Chief among them would be sanctioning Russia&#x2019;s energy giants Rosneft, Lukoil, and Gazprom, which have so far escaped direct sanctions. Keith Kellogg, Trump&#x2019;s Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia, has said that the administration&#x2019;s goal is to end the war within 100 days. While sanctions are one incentive to negotiate, &quot;their impact is likely not to be truly dangerous for Putin for several more months,&quot; former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John E. Herbst told the Kyiv Independent. In the meantime, Putin has a stronger incentive to seize more territory from Ukraine and try to kick Ukrainian forces out of Kursk before negotiating, Herbst said. &quot;It&#x2019;s a great embarrassment to Putin that Ukraine&apos;s been occupying Kursk for almost six months.&quot; While Russia has gained ground in eastern Ukraine and Kursk Oblast over the past year, it has come at the cost of record troop losses. Ukraine&#x2019;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said earlier this month that Russia&#x2019;s military losses this year will surpass losses from the previous two years combined, and the U.K. has estimated that losses could surpass one million in the next six months. &quot;I think the only way to get Putin to move faster in the short term would be for a new Trump-approved aid package to Ukraine full of weapons,&quot; said Herbst. The package wouldn&#x2019;t need to be a gift, noted Herbst, but could be a loan, or funded by frozen Russian assets or European partners. Alternatively, he said, other countries could purchase weapons for Ukraine, or the Trump administration could push for a transfer of the approximately $300 billion in frozen Russian assets, an option that has been previously discussed.

(Genya Savilov / AFP via Getty Images)&quot;That might force Putin&apos;s hand in the right direction. Although, even then, it&apos;s unclear if Putin&apos;s willing to compromise,&quot; Herbst said. Beyond weapons, supporting Ukraine with non-military financial and humanitarian aid would indirectly help Ukraine on the battlefield, by giving the country more leeway to keep fighting. Regardless of how Trump chooses to wield the military and economic leverage available to him, Trump will need to use diplomacy to bring Putin to the negotiating table and secure a peace deal. Any diplomatic maneuvering will need to not just include Ukraine and Russia but to take their allies into consideration. &quot;First, there needs to be a clear demonstration of unity among Ukraine, Europe, and the United States as to what we&apos;re trying to achieve,&quot; said Thomas Graham, a distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of &quot;Getting Russia Right.&quot; &quot;The less daylight there is between the Ukrainians, the Europeans, and the Americans, the greater leverage that President Trump will have in dealing with Putin.&quot; One way to strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s diplomatic position would be more movement in E.U. accession talks, Graham said. Ukraine would still need additional socioeconomic and political reforms, but it would signal long-term commitment from the West to further integrate Ukraine into a pan-European economic bloc. Demonstrating that the West is prepared to provide security guarantees would send a signal as well, said Graham.

(Sean Gallup / Getty Images)Ukraine is painfully aware of the limits of security guarantees outside of NATO membership or the commitment of NATO troops, following the repeated failure of the Minsk Agreements to contain Russia after its 2014 invasion. Trump has already ruled out offering Ukraine NATO membership, but many countries have signed bilateral security agreements with Ukraine since 2014. Consolidating these piecemeal agreements and providing resources to back up the agreements would be one way to give them more teeth, according to Graham. Finally, said Graham, pressure on Iran and China could further isolate Russia and complicate its international position. Iran&#x2019;s security situation has deteriorated due to the collapse of Syria&#x2019;s Assad regime in December and recent tensions with Israel. Pressure on Iran, one of Russia&#x2019;s most important allies for its war in Ukraine, could force the country to reallocate resources to addressing its own security concerns, rather than supplying Russia. &quot;And,&quot; said Graham, &quot;there are ties and conversations that we can have with the Chinese that will perhaps encourage China to be less supportive of Russia than they have up to this point.&quot; A previous peace proposal that Trump&#x2019;s team described before his inauguration ruled out Ukrainian membership in NATO for at least 20 years. &quot;And that did not impress the Russians. They still trashed Trump&#x2019;s peace initiative,&quot; pointed out former Ambassador Herbst. In contrast, Herbst said, Trump&#x2019;s team has seen President Volodymyr Zelensky signal willingness to compromise on territory, a softening of Ukraine&#x2019;s long-standing position that any peace deal must return all captured land to Ukraine. &quot;At this point, only the Ukrainians are showing some willingness to actually compromise,&quot; he said. But apart from Trump&#x2019;s comments threatening economic pressure, his administration has given little indication of its strategy for negotiations with Russia, all the experts who spoke with the Kyiv Independent noted. &quot;We have very little insight into what the administration is thinking at this point,&quot; explained Graham.	https://kyivindependent.com/what-leverage-does-trump-have-over-putin-in-peace-negotiations/	2025-01-24T09:19:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194071518.jpg
Ukraine reforming recruitment system to attract 18-25-year-olds, senior official says	Ukraine is finalizing reforms to attract 18- to 25-year-olds, currently exempt from mobilization, into enlisting voluntarily into the armed forces, Deputy Head of the President&apos;s Office Pavlo Palisa said to the Associated Press on Jan. 24. Palisa said Ukraine is exploring new recruitment options because the current drafting system, inherited from Soviet times, is outdated and inefficient. The move comes amid pressure from U.S. lawmakers to lower the draft age, though President Volodymyr Zelensky has opposed lowering it to 18, arguing it would harm Ukraine&apos;s future prospects. &quot;We need to adapt the structure to the logic of modern warfare, which will allow us to be more effective and prevent us from making the same mistakes repeatedly,&quot; Palisa said. One key initiative is an &quot;honest contract,&quot; which offers financial incentives, training guarantees, and improved communication between soldiers and commanders. &quot;To secure the unit commander and the contract soldier, establish open and professional relations between them, and set clear boundaries that are understandable to both,&quot; Palisa said. The updates to Ukraine&apos;s mobilization law, adopted in mid-April 2024, simplified the process for identifying eligible conscripts and introduced penalties for draft dodgers. The new legislation also lowered the minimum age of compulsory military service from 27 to 25. Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 are barred from leaving the country under martial law, but only those over 25 are eligible for the draft. Russian forces significantly outnumber Ukrainian units in some parts of the front and have been able to advance at record rates in eastern Ukraine while absorbing heavy losses.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-finalizes-draft-reform-to-attract-18-to-25-year-olds-media-reports/	2025-01-24T09:03:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-01-at-12.29.54-1.jpg
Trump accuses Russia of stealing plans for U.S. hypersonic missile	President Donald Trump has accused Russia of stealing U.S. plans for a hypersonic missile during the administration of President Barack Obama, telling Fox News&apos;s Sean Hannity on Jan.23 that &quot;some bad person gave them the design.&quot; &quot;Russia stole the design, they got it from us,&quot; Trump said, adding the U.S. is developing &quot;super hypersonic missiles... which is even a step better.&quot; Trump offered no evidence to back up his claim, but he previously raised the accusation in 2023, saying Russia had stolen plans for what he described as &quot;super-duper missiles.&quot; The U.S., China, India, and Russia are the only countries to have developed hypersonic missiles, of which Russia&apos;s Zircon is reported to be the fastest. Moscow has previously said the Zircon hypersonic missile entered the arsenal of the Russian army in early 2023, claiming that it has a range of 600&#x2013;1,500 kilometers, can travel at Mach 9, and has a warhead weighing about 300-400 kilograms. Russia has used Zircon missiles &#x2014; originally designed as an anti-ship missile &#x2014; to attack Ukrainian cities, with the first recorded case being in February 2024. The Kremlin has previously denied accusations it stole hypersonic missile technology, insisting they have developed their own. Elsewhere, Trump said that he wanted to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin as soon as possible to end the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported on Jan. 23. Trump also said that he wanted to explore reductions in nuclear arms. &quot;I really would like to be able to meet with President Putin soon to get that war ended,&quot; Trump said via video link, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos. &quot;It&#x2019;s a carnage. And we really have to stop that war.&quot; Later, speaking at the White House, Trump reiterated his readiness to meet Putin immediately. &quot;Every day we don&#x2019;t meet, soldiers are being killed on the battlefield,&quot; he said. Trump also claimed that President Volodymyr Zelensky had told him he was open to considering a deal to end the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-accuses-russia-of-stealing-plans-for-u-s-hypersonic-missile/	2025-01-24T07:39:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2195038636.jpg
Putin claims Russia ready for Ukraine peace talks, questions legitimacy under Zelensky's decree	Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters on Jan. 24 that Russia is ready for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump on ending the war in Ukraine. &quot;Regarding negotiations, we have always said &#x2014; and I want to emphasize this again &#x2014; that we are ready for talks on the Ukrainian issue (Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion),&quot; Putin said. However, Putin moved quickly to point out a decree signed by President Zelensky after Russia illegally annexed four Ukrainian regions, which declared negotiations with Putin &quot;impossible&quot; while leaving the door open to discussions with Russia under different leadership. &quot;How can negotiations be resumed if they are officially banned?&quot; Putin asked. He emphasized that Russia has &quot;never refused contact&quot; with the U.S. administration and maintained a &quot;pragmatic and trusting&quot; relationship with Trump. Zelensky&apos;s 2022 decree followed Russia&apos;s annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, actions condemned as illegitimate by the international community. The move reflected Ukraine&apos;s refusal to engage with Moscow while Putin remains in power, underscoring Kyiv&apos;s position that peace negotiations must uphold Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty and territorial integrity.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-claims-russia-ready-for-ukraine-talks-questions-legitimacy-under-zelenskys-decree/	2025-01-24T07:29:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1572073087.jpg
Utter bulls***' — Ukraine rejects Russia's demand to abandon NATO membership promise	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry dismissed Russia&apos;s demand to cancel NATO&apos;s 2008 promise of eventual membership for Ukraine, calling it &quot;utter bul***it&quot; in a Jan. 24 statement. The response comes after Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko criticized NATO&apos;s 2008 Bucharest Summit declaration, calling it &quot;catastrophic for European security.&quot; &quot;Aw shucks, North Korea&apos;s ally issuing ultimatums to NATO. Utter bul***it,&quot; said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi in response to Grushko&apos;s remarks. &quot;Moscow has no say here.&quot; Instead, the ministry praised NATO&apos;s decision at the time and reiterated Kyiv&apos;s commitment to joining the alliance. &quot;European security architecture is built on protection from Russia,&quot; Tykhyi said. Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022 following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. While NATO members pledged at the 2024 Washington Summit that Ukraine&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; they have yet to extend a formal invitation. Russian officials, as well as Western intellectuals with a track record of anti-Ukraine narratives have repeatedly cited Ukraine&apos;s potential NATO membership as a justification for the invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged opposition from several NATO members, including the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia, but expressed hope that U.S. President Donald Trump could sway support for Kyiv&apos;s entry. There is little evidence that the new administration would be more open to Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership than former U.S. President Joe Biden. Trump has previously criticized NATO and blamed Biden for allegedly supporting Ukraine&apos;s aspirations and provoking Russia&apos;s invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/utter-bul-it-ukraine-rejects-russias-demand-to-abandon-nato-membership-promise/	2025-01-24T07:06:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2166614075.jpg
Media investigation identifies over 90,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine	The BBC and the independent outlet Mediazona have identified the names of 90,019 Russian soldiers who died during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the BBC reported on Jan. 24. Since the media outlets&apos; last update in mid-January, the names of 1,964 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties. Some 23% of all those killed were military personnel who signed a contract with the Russian Defense Ministry after February 2022. According to the investigation, 17% of the identified soldiers were professional contractors, 17% were convicts who left for the war from prisons, and 12% were conscripts. The media revealed that nine generals and 500 soldiers with the rank of lieutenant colonel and higher were among the killed. As of Jan. 24, the highest casualty rates were among the residents of Bashkortostan, Russia&#x2019;s republic near the Ural Mountains and the homeland of the Bashkir people. Russia&#x2019;s non-Slavic ethnic groups have been overrepresented in its casualty figures in the war with Ukraine. The authorities and media in this region reported a total of 3,932 deaths during the full-scale war, the investigation read. Russia&apos;s real losses are likely higher, as the media analysis is estimated to cover 45% to 65% of the actual death toll, the BBC reported. According to the journalists&#x2019; estimates, the actual losses could range from 138,500 to 200,000 people killed. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 8 that about 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed during the full-scale invasion. The last time Moscow officially announced the number of soldiers killed was in September 2022, putting the number at 5,937. Ukraine&#x2019;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Jan. 19 that Russian forces suffered their heaviest losses last year since the start of the full-scale war, with total military losses reaching 434,000 soldiers killed and injured in 2024. This represents around half of the 800,000 killed and injured Russian soldiers since the start of the full-scale war, according to Ukraine&#x2019;s military.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-identifies-over-90-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine/	2025-01-24T06:12:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1240558742.jpg
Ukraine repatriates 757 bodies of fallen soldiers	Ukraine brought back the bodies of 757 soldiers who died fighting against Russia, the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of the Prisoners of War announced on Jan. 24. The bodies of 451 soldiers were recovered from the Donetsk sector of the front line, 71 from the Bakhmut sector, and 51 from the Vuhledar sector. Thirteen and 137 bodies were brought back from the Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia sectors, respectively. Another 34 bodies were repatriated from morgues in Russia. The Geneva Conventions say that those killed in war are entitled to a dignified burial. &quot;Law enforcement officials and forensic experts will identify the victims as soon as possible,&quot; the headquarters wrote. The operation to recover the bodies involved several government and military agencies, including the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the Interior Ministry, the State Emergency Service, and the Armed Forces. The headquarters also thanked the International Committee of the Red Cross for its assistance. In December 2024, Ukraine repatriated the bodies of 503 fallen soldiers, mostly from Donetsk Oblast. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 8 that about 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed during the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-repatriates-757-bodies/	2025-01-24T05:22:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1251615116.jpg
Investigation: How Russia profits from arms exports to Saudi Arabia despite sanctions	Few agreements are shrouded in more secrecy than inter-government arms deals &#x2014; especially when one of the parties is a global pariah leading a bloody war. But a recent massive leak of emails and documents has given us an unprecedented glimpse into a particularly secretive transaction. The leak reveals that Saudi Arabia agreed to pay Russia over 2 billion euros under a contract signed in 2021 involving companies that were repeatedly sanctioned, both before and after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Saudi Arabia doesn&#x2019;t appear to have canceled the contract after the invasion started, despite the risk of repercussions from the U.S. &#x2014; a major supplier of weapons to Saudi Arabia. Data included in the leak also shows that Russia has continued to sell arms to up to a dozen countries since the start of its invasion of Ukraine, bolstering its defense production and war effort. Apart from Saudi Arabia, the documents reveal contracts with traditional buyers of Russian weapons, such as India, China, or Algeria, none of which have stopped buying arms from Russia. The Kyiv Independent, in partnership with OCCRP, obtained a leak containing thousands of internal emails of Roselectronics, a subsidiary of Russia&apos;s state arms giant Rostec. Arms exports have traditionally been one of Russia&#x2019;s biggest sources of revenue, although far behind oil and gas. These revenues are now being used to support Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. Sanctions imposed after the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine have significantly reduced the country&#x2019;s arms exports. Still, Russia has managed to continue trade with a dozen countries that have not imposed sanctions on Moscow, making it the world&#x2019;s third-largest weapons exporter in 2023. The leak reveals the relentless efforts of Russian arms manufacturers to sustain exports during the war. Exports help support Russia&#x2019;s arms industry and fuel its war machine, despite numerous sanctions imposed over its assault on Ukraine. Analysts say the sales also serve as Russia&#x2019;s &#x201C;tool of influence,&#x201D; strengthening its alliances and helping it secure votes at the United Nations. Russia may have even obtained access to Western weapons technologies through its arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Even in internal documentation and letters, Russia maintains some secrecy when it comes to the foreign governments who buy their weapons. As the leak shows, instead of directly naming the countries that purchase their military products, Russia uses a system that assigns a code to foreign countries, known in Russian as the &#x201C;All-Russian Classifier of Countries of the World.&#x201D; For example, &#x201C;foreign customer 012&#x201D; stands for Algeria. In 2022, Russia was going to supply Algeria with its Acacia-E automatic aerospace defense system, according to the leak. When reporting on deliveries of the Post-3M radio reconnaissance station to Iran in 2021, the letters describe the buyer as &#x201C;foreign customer 364.&#x201D; When mentioning the supply of Polyana-D4M1 command and control system to Egypt, planned for 2025, they code the buyer as &quot;foreign customer 818.&quot; Yet not all the codes are so easy to decipher. The leak contains a contract encoded in a special way &#x2014; Project 82P. There is no such country code as &#x201C;82P,&#x201D; and the client country isn&#x2019;t mentioned in almost any of the letters that concerned the project. It appears that this contract was more sensitive than others. &quot;All the information related to interaction with the foreign customer specified in the contract is subject to restriction,&quot; one of the letters on Project 82P reads. It also says that to keep the details of the contract secret, Russia planned to sign separate confidentiality agreements with the banks involved in the project. Having analyzed hundreds of letters mentioning Project 82P, the Kyiv Independent can confirm that this code stands for an agreement with Saudi Arabia to supply Pantsir air defense systems. The &quot;82&quot; is a part of the country code for Saudi Arabia (682), and the letter &quot;P&quot; could be referring to the product name &#x2014; Pantsir. Within the contract, the Russian side was to supply Saudi Arabia with the Russian Pantsir-S1M system and provide additional services related to it. The Pantsir is a self-propelled air defense missile and gun system. It can shoot down missiles, airplanes, helicopters, aerial bombs, and drones. The system itself is a large truck equipped with missiles and anti-aircraft guns, which can be used alone or in battery together with a command post and radar truck. It recently gained notoriety, as a Russian Pantsir-S battery is alleged to have brought down the Azerbaijan Airlines flight on Dec. 25, killing 38 people.

(Emergency Situations of Kazakhstan/Anadolu via Getty Images)2 billion euros for Russian military productionWhile the deal was secret, some evidence surfaced in 2024 that Saudi Arabia obtained Russia&#x2019;s Pantsir systems. In February 2024, a photo appeared online showing a man, allegedly a Saudi soldier, posing next to a Pantsir with a training certificate in his hand. At the end of the year, the Saudi Air Defense&#x2019;s Bulletin listed the Pantsir among its new air defense systems. No other details were provided. With the leaked Roselectronics emails, the Kyiv Independent can piece together how Saudi Arabia obtained the Russian air defense systems. The emails reveal not only the high value of the contract but also how Saudi money flows directly to Russian military companies united under the Rostec brand. According to the leaked documents, Saudi Arabia agreed to pay 2.17 billion euros for the supply of Pantsir batteries, additional equipment and ammunition, and the training of operators. A battery is a military tactical unit consisting of several pieces of artillery working together. A Pantsir battery usually includes up to six pieces. According to various references to the contract found in the leaked emails, Saudi Arabia ordered anywhere from six to 10 Pantsir batteries. In more detail, the contract description includes 39 combat vehicles, 10 command post units, nine radio command vehicles, 20 loader vehicles, hundreds of missiles, and tens of thousands of cartridges. To maintain the Pantsirs, Saudi Arabia also ordered seven repair vehicles, five evacuation trucks, seven fuel servicing trucks, seven storage and transportation vehicles, and other equipment. They bought various simulators to train the Saudi military and planned three training rounds. The contract was signed on April 8, 2021, and was expected to last 58 months &#x2014; that is, until 2026. The Saudi Defense Ministry made an advance payment of 15% of the contract, or 326 million euros, on Aug. 5, 2021, feeding the Russian military machine with cash just six months before Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Delivery of the first batch of the air defense systems and related equipment was scheduled for the end of 2023. International trade records found in the ImportGenius database show that at the end of November 2023, Rosoboronexport made two shipments of four units of &#x201C;new special purpose motor vehicles&#x201D; to Saudi Arabia. The description is vague but the trademark of the vehicles, the names of Russian shippers and a Saudi consignee, and the cargo delivery point &#x2014; an air defense base in Jeddah &#x2014; indicate that the vehicles were supplied under the Pantsir contract. The leaked Russian documents also show how many subsidiaries of the Russian arms conglomerate Rostec, which is sanctioned by many countries for its role in the war against Ukraine, benefit from the Pantsir exports. Here&#x2019;s how Saudi money moved through the Russian arms holding. The advance payment went from the Saudi Defense Ministry to Rosoboronexport. This state company, a part of the Rostec conglomerate, acts as an intermediary for all of Russia&apos;s military exports and imports, receives payments, takes a commission for contract management, and subsequently transfers the rest of the money to the contractors. Following receipt of the advance payment, Rosoboronexport distributed the bulk of the funds to state-owned Russian arms producers &#x2014; Shipunov Design Bureau, known as the developer of the Pantsir complex, United Instrument Manufacturing Corporation (also known under its Russian acronym, OPK), the managing company of the Roselectronics holding, Sozvezdie Concern, the Scientific Research Institute of Communication and Automated Control Systems (NIISSU), the truck producer KAMAZ&#x2019; subsidiary Remdizel and others. Each entity has a role in the contract. For example, OPK has been appointed as the radio command vehicles supplier, while Sozvezdie Concern and NIISSU are its main co-executors. Russian KAMAZ and its subsidiary Remdizel produce the chassis for the system. All these companies are currently subject to numerous international sanctions either for their role in the deployment of Russian military technologies on the battlefield in Ukraine or for providing a substantial source of revenue to the Russian government during the war. Rosoboronexport has also been repeatedly subject to U.S. sanctions within a nonproliferation program against Iran, Syria, and North Korea. The latest Iran-related sanctions were imposed on Rosoboronexport in 2023. Rostec was subject to U.S. sanctions before 2022, including for its connection with Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and military cooperation with China. Sanctions on Rostec companies involved in the production and supply of the Pantsir system. (Lisa Kukharska / The Kyiv Independent)The transfer of Russian technology to Saudi ArabiaAccording to the leak, the delivery of Pantsir batteries and additional equipment is only part of the 82P Project. In addition to the 2-billion-euro contract, the documents describing the project mention a second major part of the cooperation. The contract for it, even three contracts, was not yet signed in the first half of 2022, but was already being discussed. This includes localizing Russian Pantsir systems production in Saudi Arabia, establishing maintenance centers in the country, and creating a training center. The future localization of production was Saudi Arabia&apos;s requirement to sign the first contract to supply air defense systems. A leaked letter titled &#x201C;Localization Plan&#x201D; contains a 69-page document entitled Proposal for the Localization of the Pantsir-S1M Complex Production. The proposal includes three localization programs. The first describes the large-scale assembly of 15 Pantsir batteries in Saudi Arabia. The second localization program establishes a network of service centers for Pantsir maintenance (five regional and one central repair workshop). The third program involves building a training center in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia&apos;s second-largest city and &quot;economic capital.&quot; The center would require the construction of a 15,000-square-metre study building. Although none of the three contracts had been signed during the time period covered by the leak, the leaked documents mentioned that Saudi Arabia was ready to sign the assembling production contract in the second half of 2022. If the contracts were indeed signed, Russia could receive even more than 2 billion euros from Saudi Arabia over the next few years. Russia&apos;s war with Ukraine, though, could have affected the fate of any joint Pantsir assembly in Saudi Arabia, as the war has allegedly already affected a couple of other Russian export contracts. &quot;There was a report that Russia had taken away the shells made for Azerbaijan because it needed them in the war against Ukraine,&quot; Ivan Kirichevsky, an analyst at Defense Express, reported. &quot;Another report indicates that Russian T-90S export tanks intended to be sold to India, Algeria, or Vietnam were also spotted on the battlefield in Ukraine. So there are some doubts as to whether Russians can reach the next stage of the Saudi contract &#x2014; the organization of joint production. They are now highly dependent on imports of various equipment and electronic components. This may affect co-production arrangements.&quot; The Pantsir contract carries with it the risk of Russia becoming familiar with Western technologies through its cooperation with Saudi Arabia. The country is a major buyer of U.S. weaponry and buys arms from South Korea and EU countries, including air defense systems. &quot;Saudi Arabia is one of the major operators of Patriot systems. Whether the Russians could have gained access to them is a sensitive issue,&quot; said Ivan Kirichevsky, an analyst at Defense Express, a Kyiv-based military think tank. &quot;The U.S. has demonstrated that it is sensitive to the risk of transferring its technology to third parties.&#x201D; Kirichevsky cites the example of Turkey. In 2020, four months before the Russian-Saudi agreement was signed, the U.S. slapped sanctions on Turkey over a purchase of the Russian S-400 missile system. The risk of Russians accessing U.S. technology is high since the Project 82P also includes &#x201C;integration&#x201D; services, meaning integrating the Pantsir complex into Saudi Arabia&apos;s command, communications, and intelligence system. Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman hold a meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Dec. 6, 2023. (Sergei Savostyanov / Pool / AFP via Getty Images)Those services would be performed by Russian specialists, who could obtain access to the existing Saudi arsenal, which is stuffed with U.S. weapons. Moreover, Russia appeared to have asked for this access. In October 2021, some six months after signing the contract, Saudi Arabia&apos;s representatives met with the Russian side in Moscow to discuss the execution of Project 82P. The Kyiv Independent found the meeting&#x2019;s minutes in Russian companies&#x2019; emails. The emails mention an upcoming trip by Russian representatives to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, scheduled for May 2022. While discussing the meeting, the Russian side requested to visit Saudi air defense facilities &#x2014; and received consent. They started making preparations for the trip like booking the hotel, car rental, and buying tickets. The obtained email leak covers the time up until May 2022, the same month when the trip was supposed to take place. While the Kyiv Independent can&#x2019;t confirm that the trip took place, there was no sign it was canceled either. The Saudi Defense Ministry did not respond to a written inquiry from the Kyiv Independent. Russia&#x2019;s efforts show it&#x2019;s highly interested in selling arms and military technology abroad, despite its massive need for weapons for its war against Ukraine. &#xA0; According to one of the leaked letters, in June 2022, four months after the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, state arms exporter Rosoboronexport held a three-day meeting with arms manufacturers in St. Petersburg. The event was private, with no public mentions of it. The topic was promoting Russia&apos;s anti-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipment &quot;with high export potential.&quot; A Rosoboronexport representative held a presentation on how export sales could be boosted. Two months later, in August 2022, Rosoboronexport hosted a different event, this time a public one. Its seven-day International Military-Technical Forum aimed to secure new arms sales contracts. It reportedly attracted delegations from 50 countries. Local media made no secret of Russia&#x2019;s efforts to interest foreign delegations in a wide range of military products, including tanks, armored vehicles, UAVs and anti-UAVs, air defense systems, rifles, mortars, and fighter aircraft. Similar events were held in 2023 and 2024 and are planned for 2025. Trying so hard to sell weapons abroad while leading a resource-demanding war may seem like an odd thing to do but there are at least two good reasons for Russia to pursue it: high export revenue and strengthening geopolitical ties. Arms under export contracts are traditionally sold at a higher price than those supplied to the domestic army. &quot;The policy of arms export contracts is always the same: You sell your products to someone for export at a premium to supply your army at a lower cost,&quot; said Kirichevsky, an analyst at Defense Express. &quot;The price of the 2 billion euros for six Pantsir batteries seems very high, even when it includes additional equipment and training for the military.&quot; Although Russia&#x2019;s export capacity started crumbling after the start of Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, it remained a significant exporter of military products. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) compared data on Russian arms exports for two periods: 2014-2018 and 2019-2023. The institute found that, between those two periods, the volume of Russian arms exports fell by 53%. The number of countries willing to buy Russian arms has also decreased, but 12 countries were still buying Russian weapons in 2023. Leaked letters show that Rosoboronexport received new export inquiries after Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. In spring 2022, soon after the world learned about the Russian massacre of civilians in Ukraine&#x2019;s Bucha and other places, the Russian defense conglomerate received new inquiries from potential clients. The leaked emails show that Armenia inquired about a possible delivery of the Ranzhir-M1, a command center unit for air defense systems. Meanwhile, Venezuela was interested in Pishchal-Pro and Kupol complexes, the systems that take down unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs. The Kyiv Independent was unable to find confirmation of such deliveries in public sources, or in the customs records available through leaks. Russia also continued to work on executing contracts signed in previous years. There are no mentions of any contracts canceled by either side after the start of the invasion. In 2022, Rostec worked on contracts with China, India, Algeria, Egypt, Belarus, and several other countries, all of which continued to receive military supplies from Russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and new sanctions against the Russian defense companies. Experts say that Russia is motivated to sell its weapons abroad not only by money but by the prospect of establishing or strengthening of geopolitical ties. &#xA0; &quot;Russia sees arms sales as another tool of statecraft. It&apos;s a tactic,&quot; Anna Borshchevskaya, a senior fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, says. &quot;It&apos;s not independent of foreign policy, and so arms sales will strengthen bilateral ties between countries on a political level. It&apos;s a tool of influence from the Russian perspective.&quot; According to Agiya Zagrebelska, a Ukrainian sanctions expert and representative of the NGO Economic Security Council of Ukraine, the result of such ties can be seen in the countries&apos; votes at the UN. Although the allegiance to Russia is not as clear as in the case of Belarus, China, or Iran, Saudi Arabia has abstained from more than half of the UN votes for resolutions on Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. (See the chart) How countries buying Russian weapons vote at the UN. (Lisa Kukharska / The Kyiv Independent)On the one hand, the country voted for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. However, it abstained from voting on resolutions on the suspension of Russia&#x2019;s rights of membership in the Human Rights Council and on remedy and reparation for aggression against Ukraine. Saudi Arabia has also helped to free foreigners imprisoned by the Russian military and brought together 42 countries in Jeddah to find ways to end the Russian war in Ukraine. It has also allegedly threatened the G7 against seizing Russia&#x2019;s frozen assets, according to Bloomberg&#x2019;s sources. The country has also promised to provide Ukraine with $400 million in humanitarian aid while pledging billions to Russia&#x2019;s military enterprises. Yet even with rich clients like Saudi Arabia, the volume of Russia&#x2019;s arms exports has fallen in recent years. Due to Western sanctions, it has become both difficult and costly for Russia to import Western equipment and electronic components it still needs for defense production. Some reports also suggest that Russia deployed some of the weapons meant for export to the front line in Ukraine. This makes Russia an increasingly problematic supplier. Hey! This is Alisa Yurchenko, the author of this story. Thank you for reading it. I spent the past two months reading leaked internal correspondence of Russian state defense companies. The letters were scattered and out of order, so I had to reconstruct their timeline like a jigsaw puzzle. But it was all worth it. I was glad to reveal how many sanctioned Russian military companies profit from a major arms export deal. Understanding this is crucial as such deals bolster Russian defense industry and the country&#x2019;s geopolitical standing &#x2014; all while Russia is waging a full-scale war. We are not done with this particular leak, however. We are still analyzing it and will soon share insights about Russia&apos;s efforts to source foreign components for its defense industry.

Russia says ban on Ukraine’s NATO accession ’key’ condition for resolving war	Moscow sees a ban on Ukraine&#x2019;s entry to NATO as a key condition in resolving the Russia-Ukraine war, the pro-Kremlin news agency Interfax reported on Jan. 24, citing Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko. &quot;And will not only seek ironclad international guarantees that will prevent Ukraine&#x2019;s membership in NATO in any form, but we will also insist it will become a policy of the alliance itself,&quot; Grushko said on air on the Rossiya-24 television channel. The statement comes amid expectations of peace talks in 2025 as U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table and end the full-scale war that has been ongoing for nearly three years. &quot;For us, this is one of the key elements of a possible deal on the conflict in Ukraine, this relates to the elimination of the root causes of this conflict,&quot; Grushko said about putting an end to Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO prospects. The Russian deputy minister lashed out against the NATO Bucharest Summit&#x2019;s resolution from 2008 that Ukraine and Georgia would eventually become members of the alliance. Grushko called the statement &quot;catastrophic for European security&quot; and said a failure to withdraw it would create an &quot;unacceptable ambiguity&quot; for Russia. Despite the allied pledge, Kyiv and Tbilisi failed to obtain the Membership Action Plan at the summit. Ukraine officially submitted its application to NATO in September 2022 in the wake of the full-scale invasion. Though pledging that Ukraine&#x2019;s path toward membership is &quot;irreversible&quot; at the allied summit in Washington in 2024, NATO members have yet to extend a formal invitation. Russian officials have previously listed Ukraine&#x2019;s possible entry into NATO as one of the justifications for launching the full-scale invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that several NATO countries &#x2013; namely the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia &#x2013; continue to oppose Ukraine&#x2019;s membership but voiced his belief that Trump could sway all the members should he decide to support Kyiv&#x2019;s entry. There is little evidence that the new Trump administration would be more open to accepting Ukraine into NATO than former U.S. President Joe Biden. Trump even attacked Biden over alleged support for Kyiv&apos;s aspirations, claiming it provoked Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/moscow-names-ban-on-ukraines-nato-accession-key-demand-in-potential-talks/	2025-01-24T04:46:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2161623541.jpg
Russian army failing to outflank Pokrovsk, Ukraine's military says	The Russian army is failing to outflank Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast in an attempt to cut off the town&apos;s logistics routes, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces, Viktor Trehubov, said on Jan. 24 on national television. The area near Pokrovsk, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian forces, has been the focus of fierce fighting for months as Russia intensifies its offensive in Donetsk Oblast. Russian forces are trying to bypass Pokrovsk from the north and south, but so far without success, according to the spokesperson. &quot;So far, these attempts have been more or less effectively repelled. They have begun to attack the town more actively with long-range, different types of missiles and FPV (first-person-view) drones,&quot; Trehubov said. &quot;Unfortunately, they are hitting the town, but their plan to surround it is still very far from realization,&quot; he added. The estimated Russian advance in the Pokrovsk sector in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 23, 2025, according to DeepState. Pokrovsk marked by a black symbol. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Trehubov stressed that the Pokrovsk sector of the front line is the primary vector of Russia&apos;s offensive. &quot;This is the main point of concentration of their efforts, and it has been for a long time. There is the largest number of clashes there,&quot; he said. Russian troops are continuing to push on the Lyman, Siversk, Kramatorsk, Toretsk, Pokrovsk and Kurakhove axes, according to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff. Pokrovsk and Kurakhove remain the focal points of the Russian eastern offensive, now in its fifth month. Ukraine previously blew up the No. 3 mine&apos;s shaft in the village of Pishchane near Pokrovsk to prevent Russia from deploying its troops closer to the front-line town, according to The New York Times (NYT) Earlier this month, Metinvest announced it had suspended operations at the Pokrovsk coking coal mine due to worsening security conditions and power outages.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-army-fails-to-outflank-pokrovsk-cut-it-off-from-logistics-ukraines-military-says/	2025-01-24T04:33:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184404872.jpg
Trump plans to reach out to North Korea’s Kim Jong Un	U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview on Jan. 23 he intends to again engage North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, signaling a shift from the previous Biden administration. &quot;I&apos;ll reach out to him again,&quot; Trump said in the interview with Fox News. Kim, who Trump lauded as a &quot;smart guy,&quot; has become Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s key ally in a war against Ukraine, providing ballistic missiles and artillery and sending 12,000 troops to fight in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. &quot;He&#x2019;s not a religious zealot. He happens to be a smart guy,&quot; the U.S. president said, adding that he had good relations with Kim during his first presidential term in 2017-2021. The North Korean dictator has grown increasingly assertive in recent years, cementing an alliance with Russia and carrying out new missile tests. This prompted sharp deterioration of relations with the U.S. under the Biden administration and rising tensions on the Korean peninsula. Initially dismissive of the North Korean leader during his first term in office, Trump later engaged Pyongyang in a rare diplomatic effort to halt the North Korean nuclear program and even claimed to have built a warm personal relationship with Kim. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently admitted that Trump&#x2019;s diplomatic efforts did not achieve any &quot;enduring&quot; progress in stalling Pyongyang&#x2019;s nuclear arms development. Trump&#x2019;s return to the White House is expected to bring geopolitical shifts as the president has often voiced sympathies for the U.S.&#x2019;s rivals and authoritarian leaders, like Putin or Kim, while being critical of Washington&#x2019;s allies. The U.S. president said he plans to reach out to Putin and broker a peace deal in Ukraine, threatening with additional sanctions unless Moscow agrees to negotiate.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-plans-to-reach-out-to-north-koreas-kim-jong-un/	2025-01-24T03:45:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1159161640.jpg
Victory means restoring territorial integrity' — Merz reaffirms support for Ukraine ahead of elections	Friedrich Merz, the leading contender to become Germany&apos;s next chancellor, said that if elected, his strategic priorities would include a just end to Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, Der Spiegel reported on Jan. 23. The statement comes after Merz&#x2019;s meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan. 22. Merz is the chancellor candidate of the conservative CDU/CSU alliance for the February parliamentary elections. The veteran politician has repeatedly criticized sitting Chancellor Olaf Scholz for supposedly hesitant approach in the support of Ukraine and called for the provision of long-range Taurus missiles. Speaking about ending the war, Merz stressed that Ukraine should &quot;win the war&quot; and be free to choose its political and military alliances. &quot;Victory means restoring territorial integrity with a democratically legitimate government exercising full sovereignty,&quot; Merz added. The German politician nevertheless stressed that Germany should not become a party to the war. Germany has become Ukraine&#x2019;s second largest military donor after the U.S., making it Kyiv&#x2019;s leading supporter on the European continent. Berlin&#x2019;s importance in the pro-Ukraine coalition is likely to grow as U.S. President Donald Trump hinted at reducing his country&#x2019;s involvement in the war. While Berlin has allocated 4 billion euros ($4.2 billion) in defense aid for Ukraine in 2025, some ministers of the outgoing coalition government called for an additional 3 billion ($3.15 billion), a step Scholz refuses to take without additional borrowing. The CDU/CSU alliance, whose backing is crucial for any bill to pass the parliament since the ruling coalition lost majority, voiced support for the additional aid package but rejected abandoning the debt break, leading to a legislative impasse.	https://kyivindependent.com/merz-voices-support-for-ukraine-ahead-of-elections/	2025-01-24T03:31:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187620278--1-.jpg
Putin ready to talk to Trump, Kremlin 'awaits signals' from US	Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to hold talks with U.S. President Donald Trump, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Jan. 24 during a press briefing. Trump has previously said he wants to meet with Putin &quot;very quickly&quot; after his inauguration. The Kremlin welcomed Trump&apos;s comments but added that no preparations were currently underway for the meeting. &quot;Putin is ready, we are waiting for signals, everyone is ready... If there is something, we will inform you,&quot; Peskov said. Moscow is ready for talks with Washington on nuclear disarmament as well, but the arsenals of the U.S.&#x2019;s allies &#x2014; the U.K. and France &#x2014; must also be considered, the spokesperson claimed. &quot;In the interests of the whole world, in the interests of the peoples of our countries, of course, we are interested in starting this negotiation process as soon as possible,&quot; he added. Peskov also reacted to Trump&apos;s recent statement that he would ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which Russia is a member, to lower the oil price and that this would end the war &quot;immediately.&quot; The spokesperson opposed the statement, saying that the war is not dependent on oil prices and is allegedly taking place because of &quot;the danger to Russia and the Russians.&quot; The Trump team hopes to quickly begin work on a settlement plan that could be implemented within the first few months of his presidency. A meeting with Putin is part of the plan, according to CNN. Trump has often voiced sympathies for the Russian leader while criticizing the level of support the previous Biden administration provided to Kyiv. This prompted concerns that the new U.S. leadership might cut a deal unfavorable to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-ready-to-talk-to-trump-kremlin-awaits-signals-from-us/	2025-01-24T02:41:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1251866099.jpg
Ukraine’s UAVs target Russian refinery, plants in massive strike	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and Ukraine&#x2019;s Special Operations Forces (SOS) struck the Ryazan Oil Refinery and the Ryazan Thermal Power Plant in an overnight drone strike on Jan. 24, an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. The news comes as Russia&#x2019;s Defense Ministry reported intercepting 121 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 37 in Bryansk Oblast, 20 in Ryazan Oblast, and 17 in the Kursk and Saratov oblasts each. The refinery, one of Russia&#x2019;s largest, has the capacity of 17 million metric tons of oil per year. At least three oil depots and a workshop were set ablaze, according to the source. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video that purports to show the aftermath of a Ukrainian drone strike against Ryazan, Russia, on Jan. 24, 2025. (SBU source)The statement confirms earlier reports in Russian Telegram channels that the Ryazan Oil Refinery caught fire after a drone attack. &quot;SBU and SOS drones also targeted an oil pumping station at the Ryazan Thermal Power Plant,&quot; the source said, without revealing details on possible consequences. Ryazan lies roughly 500 kilometers (310 miles) north of Ukraine&#x2019;s border. Drones also attacked the Kremniy EL microelectronics plant in Russia&apos;s Bryansk and other facilities in the city, the independent Telegram news channel Astra reported, citing Russian Emergencies Ministry sources. It is not immediately clear whether the plant, which produces components for the Russian military, suffered significant damage in the attack. The drone strike also damaged windows and the facade of a building of the Investigative Committee, and the Institute of Management and Business caught fire, according to Astra. Andrii Kovalenko, the counter-disinformation chief at Ukraine&#x2019;s National Security and Defense Council, also reported on the attack against the Kremniy plant. The facility has suspended operations after sustaining hits, Kovalenko claimed, saying that the plant produces microelectronics for Russian air defenses, Iskander missiles, electronic warfare equipment, and drones. This is the third time the plant was hit during the full-scale war, Kovalenko said. The city of Bryansk lies around 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Russia&#x2019;s border with Ukraine. The attack against the Ryazan oil facilities and the Kremniy plant was later confirmed by the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. Recent weeks saw Ukraine again intensify long-range strikes against military and industrial facilities in Russia&#x2019;s rear in an effort to undermine Moscow&#x2019;s ability to wage war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-uavs-reportedly-attack-russian-microelectronics-plant-other-facilities-overnight/	2025-01-24T02:09:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/2025-01-24-12_03_42.jpg
Uncontrolled escalation' — Russia opposes NATO peacekeepers in Ukraine	Deploying a NATO peacekeeping contingent to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire in the war with Russia could lead to &quot;uncontrolled escalation,&quot; Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova claimed on Jan. 23 during a press briefing. The statement comes amid discussions about a possible deployment of European soldiers to Ukraine to monitor a future ceasefire deal. Zakharova also mentioned recent statements by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius that their countries could provide troops for a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine. &quot;The intervention of NATO troops in Ukraine is categorically unacceptable for Russia, it will turn into uncontrolled escalation,&quot; she said. Zelensky has been in contact with several European leaders about the prospects of the peacekeeping mission, an initiative that French President Emmanuel Macron has spearheaded. Pistorius said earlier that Germany, as NATO&apos;s largest member in Europe, &quot;will have a role to play&quot; in keeping peace in Ukraine, while Starmer said that the U.K. had discussed the idea of a peacekeeping mission with other allies and that it will play a &quot;full part&quot; in peacekeeping efforts. The idea has also found support from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called upon Europe to take up greater responsibility for Ukraine&#x2019;s security and pledged to bring a swift end to the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/sending-nato-peacekeepers-to-ukraine-could-lead-to-uncontrolled-escalation-russia-claims/	2025-01-24T01:13:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1237721878.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 6, injure 9 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed at least six people and injured at least nine over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 24. Russia launched 58 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force said. Twenty-five drones were shot down over seven oblasts, while 27 were lost in the airspace without causing damage, according to the statement. Drone attacks in Kyiv Oblast killed three civilians and injured a 26-year old man, the regional police department said. Two of the people killed in the attacks were a married couple in Brovary and another man in the Fastiv district, according to the State Emergency Service. Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast over the past day killed two people and injured five, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Two civilians were killed and two injured in an attack against the city of Kostiantynivka, two were injured in Kramatorsk, and one in Pokrovsk, according to the statement. In Kharkiv Oblast, a 54-year-old woman was killed in a drone attack against the village of Petropavlivka, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Three civilians were injured in Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast, said the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. Two apartment buildings and nine houses were damaged.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-121/	2025-01-24T00:17:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/2025-01-24-10_10_01.jpg
Seoul suspects North Korea plans to send more troops to Russia-Ukraine war	North Korea is preparing to send more troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine, even after incurring significant losses, the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) warned on Jan. 24, according to the Yonhap news agency. North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in early August 2024. Ukrainian forces have continued fighting in the region, hoping to leverage their positions for potential negotiations. &quot;With around four months having passed since the deployment of troops to the war between Russia and Ukraine, (North Korea) is assumed to be accelerating preparations for additional measures and deployment amid multiple casualties and occurrence of prisoners,&quot; the statement read, according to Yonhap. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, said previously that Pyongyang is reportedly preparing reinforcements, mainly gun and rocket artillery units, to participate in the war in Ukraine. The New York Times reported that according to an undisclosed U.S. official, fresh North Korean troops could arrive within two months. North Korea is also expected to send Russia 150 short-range KN-23 ballistic missiles in 2025, according to Budanov. Experts interviewed by the Kyiv Independent connected North Korea&#x2019;s high casualty rates to a lack of experience with modern warfare, the &quot;human wave&quot; tactics employed against entrenched Ukrainian positions, and the resolve of North Korean troops to avoid capture, even at the cost of their own lives. Only two North Korean soldiers are in Ukrainian captivity since Pyongyang deployed its troops in Kursk Oblast last fall.	https://kyivindependent.com/south-korea-suspects-north-korea-of-sending-more-troops-to-war-in-ukraine/	2025-01-23T23:39:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1734340818.jpg
Zelensky is ’no angel’ — Trump suggests Ukrainian president shares blame for war	U.S. President Donald Trump indicated that both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine&#x2019;s President Volodymyr Zelensky share the blame for the Ukraine-Russia war in an interview segment with Fox News released on Jan. 23. &quot;Zelensky... shouldn&#x2019;t have allowed this to happen either. He&#x2019;s no angel,&quot; Trump said. &quot;First of all, he&#x2019;s fighting a much bigger entity.&quot; Already during his electoral campaign, Trump implied that his predecessor, former U.S. President Joe Biden, and Zelensky share blame for Russia&#x2019;s ongoing invasion and pledged to broker a swift peace deal. The U.S. president, who most recently met Zelensky in Paris in December, criticized his Ukrainian counterpart for initially &quot;wanting to fight&quot; instead of cutting a deal. At the same time, Trump acknowledged Ukraine&#x2019;s bravery in resisting Russia and said that the Ukrainian president has &quot;had enough&quot; and is ready for peace. &quot;We started pouring equipment... and they (Ukraine) had the bravery to use the equipment, but in the end, it&#x2019;s a war that has to be settled,&quot; Trump said. Trump has been often critical of the Biden administration&#x2019;s support for Ukraine and boasted about good relations with Putin, sparking concerns he might broker a deal unfavorable to Kyiv. Recently, the U.S. president has adopted a more critical stance toward Moscow, criticizing Putin for reluctance to cut a deal and threatening with economic repercussions if he fails to do so. &quot;Putin shouldn&#x2019;t have done it (launching the full-scale invasion)... and it has to stop,&quot; Trump said, claiming that Russia had lost around 850,000 soldiers while Ukraine lost 700,000. Zelensky put Ukraine&#x2019;s casualty rates at 43,000 killed and 370,000 wounded as of December, while Moscow does not reveal its losses. In the interview, Trump reiterated his warnings that if Russia does not agree to negotiate, the U.S. is going to impose &quot;massive tariffs and massive taxes, and... big sanctions,&quot; adding he &quot;doesn&#x2019;t want to do it&quot; because he &quot;loves&quot; Russia. The U.S. president echoed his earlier claims that the full-scale invasion would have never started if he were in office at the time, blaming the Biden administration for supposedly provoking Putin and allowing him to profit from high energy prices. Trump also lashed out against the former president for not pressuring European countries to donate more support to Ukraine, falsely claiming that Washington spent &quot;$200 billion more than Europe.&quot; The U.S. Congress has allocated over $170 billion to Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, which included the provision of over $60 billion worth of military support. The EU and its member countries have made available $145 billion in financial, military, and humanitarian assistance during the full-scale war. Ukraine recently announced that arrangements for a meeting between Trump and Zelensky are underway, while the U.S. president also said he aims to meet Putin in the coming days to discuss an end to the war. Moscow welcomed Trump&#x2019;s proposal for a meeting but voiced skepticism about a possible peace deal, saying it has to first understand what the U.S.&#x2019;s goals are before entering into any negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-is-no-angel-trump-claims-ukrainian-president-shares-blame-for-war/	2025-01-23T23:02:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2188254103.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 826,820 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 826,820 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 24. This number includes 1,500 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,852 tanks, 20,508 armored fighting vehicles, 34,992 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,295 artillery systems, 1,263 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,050 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 23,162 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-826-820-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-23T22:17:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/LEM_2194-1.jpg
2 killed, 1 injured in Russian drone attack on Kyiv Oblast	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Two people have been killed and one other injured in a drone attack overnight on Jan. 24 targeting Kyiv Oblast, the regional military administration reported. A 36-year-old man was killed in the city of Brovary, just outside the capital Kyiv, when falling drone debris struck a 10-storey building. One other person, a 26-year-old man was injured in the ensuing fire at the residential building, sustaining superficial burns to his upper respiratory tract, the Kyiv Oblast Military Administration said. Elsewhere in the region, one person was killed when drone debris fell onto a home. No additional details were provided on the identity of the victim. The full extent of the damage to the residential structures was not immediately clear. Both fires caused by the attacks have been extinguished by emergency crews. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force warned throughout the night of the threat of Russian drone attacks on the capital. Air defenses operated throughout the night. Russia has ramped up the use of attack drones over the past year, regularly launching drones at various targets across the country, including Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/2-killed-1-injured-in-russian-drone-attack-on-kyiv-oblast/	2025-01-23T21:10:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/1000000276.jpg
John Ratcliffe confirmed as CIA Director	The U.S. Senate formally confirmed John Ratcliffe as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on Jan. 23. Ratcliffe, who served as President Donald Trump&apos;s director of national intelligence during part of Trump&apos;s first term in office, was confirmed with 74 senators voting in favor and 24 voting against the appointment. Ratcliffe becomes the second Trump nominee to secure an appointment from the Senate, days after State Secretary Marco Rubio was sworn into his new post. Ratcliffe replaces Bill Burns as the head of the spy agency. During his term as the head of the CIA, Burns reportedly regularly communicated with Ukrainian officials for purposes of intelligence sharing. Burns made his final visit to Kyiv on Dec. 21 to meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky, marking a rare public acknowledgment of their discussions during Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Zelensky noted that he and Burns had met multiple times throughout the war, but such encounters were typically kept confidential The United States under former President Joe Biden had been Ukraine&apos;s key ally, providing substantial financial and military aid since the all-out war began nearly three years ago. Washington is also reported to have consistently shared military intelligence to bolster Ukraine&apos;s defense. In his Senate hearing last week, Ratcliffe alluded to foreign adversaries Russia and China, referring the need for the U.S. to improve the use of artificial intelligence. Ratcliffe, a staunch supporter of Trump, also echoed comments from the president that the Russia-Ukraine war threatens to draw the U.S. into a conflict with a &quot;nuclear country.&quot; It is unclear if the Trump administration will continue to provide the same level of intelligence sharing with Ukraine as it received during the Biden administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/john-ratcliffe-confirmed-as-cia-director/	2025-01-23T18:51:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/1000000261.jpg
Fire reported at oil refinery in Russia's Ryazan Oblast amid drone strike	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A fire erupted at the Ryazan Oil Refinery in Russia after a mass drone attack targeting several regions, Russian Telegram channels reported on Jan. 23. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, air defense systems also intercepted 49 drones across Kursk, Bryansk, Belgorod oblasts, as well as occupied Crimea. Social media reports noted drone activity in Ryazan Oblast, located southeast of Moscow, where explosions were heard at the RNPK oil depot. At least 10 drones were reportedly shot down over the facility, and a fire broke out. The Kyiv Independent cannot immediately verify the reports. The head of the Center for Countering Disinformation of the National Security and Defense Council, Andrey Kovalenko, said that the Ryazan Oil Refinery is one of the key facilities in the Russian oil industry, though it is under sanctions. &#x201C;The refinery plays an important role in providing fuel for both the civilian and military-industrial complex of Russia,&#x201D; he said on Telegram. &#x201C;It produces fuel for military equipment, aviation kerosene, diesel fuel and other types of petroleum products used in tanks, aircraft, ships and other equipment of the Russian Armed Forces.&#x201D; The attack comes amid an uptick in Ukraine&#x2019;s drone operations targeting Russian energy infrastructure. Ukraine has targeted Russia&apos;s fossil fuel infrastructure as part of its strategy to undermine a key funding source for Russia&apos;s war effort. &#x200C;&#x200C;	https://kyivindependent.com/fire-reported-at-ryazan-oil-refinery-in-russia-amid-alleged-drone-strike/	2025-01-23T17:25:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/Ryazan-oil-refinery.jpg
Trump announces readiness to meet with Putin as soon as possible, Reuters reports	U.S. President Donald Trump said that he wanted to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin as soon as possible to end the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported on Jan. 23. Trump also said that he wanted to explore reductions in nuclear arms. &#x201C;I really would like to be able to meet with President Putin soon to get that war ended,&#x201D; Trump said via video link, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a carnage. And we really have to stop that war.&#x201D; Later, speaking at the White House, Trump reiterated his readiness to meet Putin immediately. &#x201C;Every day we don&#x2019;t meet, soldiers are being killed on the battlefield,&#x201D; he said. Trump also claimed that President Volodymyr Zelensky had told him he was open to considering a deal to end the war. While Trump stated that U.S. peace efforts were underway, he offered no specific details. On Jan. 21, at the World Economic Forum, Zelensky revealed that discussions were underway to organize a meeting with Trump. &quot;We are your partner. We know all the sore spots; we have lost our people,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to end the war this year. But not just quickly, but fairly and, above all, reliably for us.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-announces-readiness-to-meet-with-putin-as-soon-as-possible-reuters-reports/	2025-01-23T16:39:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179841418.jpg
Putin has no right to veto any country's NATO accession, NATO Secretary General says	NATO Chief Mark Rutte said on Jan. 23 that Russian President Vladimir Putin has no authority to influence NATO&apos;s future membership decisions. &#x201C;We must clearly understand that Vladimir Putin has no veto power and no say over who will join NATO in the future. Unless, of course, he himself wants to join NATO, but I don&apos;t think he wants that,&#x201D; Rutte said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He emphasized that Ukraine&apos;s full NATO membership is the best guarantee for lasting peace. &#x201C;Whatever the outcome, it must be clear that peace is sustainable&#x2026; when they (negotiations) end, we must be confident that the peace we collectively supported will be enduring and will never be questioned again,&#x201D; he said. Rutte also highlighted the need to avoid repeating the failures of the Minsk agreements and stressed the importance of ensuring Ukraine is in the strongest possible position before any future negotiations with Russia. Earlier in the day, Rutte called on the United States to continue supplying weapons to Ukraine, pledging that Europe will shoulder the financial burden. Nearly 3,000 representatives from over 130 countries, including 60 heads of state and government, 900 CEOs of the world&#x2019;s leading companies, and forum partners, are expected to attend the forum in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-has-no-right-to-veto-any-countrys-nato-accession-nato-secretary-general-says/	2025-01-23T14:48:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2184023227.jpg
Trump’s 90-day foreign aid suspension order does not impact weapon deliveries to Ukraine, Pentagon says	U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s executive order suspending foreign aid programs for 90 days does not apply to military assistance for Ukraine, the Pentagon confirmed to the Ukrainian Service of Voice of America on Jan. 23. &#x201C;Security assistance to Ukraine is not subject to the restrictions of the recent foreign assistance order, as it only applies to development programs, not military support,&#x201D; the U.S. Department of Defense stated. Contracts under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) and weapon deliveries from U.S. warehouses under the Presidential Depletion Authority (PDA) will remain unaffected. These programs, among others, were initiated during President Biden&#x2019;s administration. While Ukrainian military assistance is exempt from the 90-day suspension, the status of development and humanitarian programs is uncertain and still under review. The 90-day suspension was published by the White House on Jan. 20, as one of the numerous executive orders Trump has passed since becoming president. In the document, Trump wrote that &quot;the United States foreign aid industry and bureaucracy are not aligned with American interests and in many cases antithetical to American values,&quot; without mentioning specific examples. In addition to development aid, the U.S. has provided Kyiv with $66 billion in military assistance since the outbreak of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-90-day-foreign-add-suspension-order-does-not-impact-weapon-deliveries-to-ukraine-pentagon-says/	2025-01-23T12:52:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/--------------2024-03-19-202210.png
Ukraine war latest: Russian forces suspected of killing 6 Ukrainian POWs in Donetsk Oblast	Key developments on Jan. 23: Ukrainian prosecutors are investigating a case of Russian troops summarily executing six Ukrainian captives in the embattled Donetsk Oblast, the Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office said on Jan. 23. The statement came in reaction to a video circulating on social media, recorded by Russian soldiers, that apparently shows the execution of the six prisoners of war (POW). The footage also shows a seventh Ukrainian soldier lying on the ground, whose fate is unknown. &quot;According to preliminary information, during an assault against Ukrainian positions in Donetsk Oblast, Russian soldiers took six Ukrainian soldiers captive and subsequently shot them,&quot; the Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office said in a statement. Executing prisoners of war is a serious violation of the Geneva Conventions and a war crime. Ukraine&#x2019;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said he had reached out to the U.N. and the International Committee of the Red Cross regarding the case. Throughout the full-scale war, Ukraine has documented widespread violations of the Geneva Conventions by Russian forces, including the execution of over 100 POWs in 2024 alone, according to Lubinets. Reports of torture, murder, and abuse of Ukrainian captives &#x2014; particularly in Donetsk Oblast &#x2014; have surged in recent months. Visual evidence of these atrocities continues to emerge, underscoring Russia&apos;s disregard for international law. Ukrainian troops positioned near the village of Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk Oblast are at risk of encirclement by Russian forces, military spokesperson Viktor Trehubov said on Jan. 23. Russian forces are attempting to take control of access routes to the village through heavy fire, according to Trehubov, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces. &quot;Velyka Novosilka is currently in a rather difficult situation. Ukrainian soldiers are doing everything to prevent further advances of the enemy,&quot; Trehubov said. However, the geographical layout of the area, including a river that cuts through the village, complicates defensive maneuvers, according to Trehubov. A screenshot of the map by the DeepState monitoring group as of Jan. 23, 2025, showing the front-line village of Velyka Novosilka, Donetsk Oblast. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)According to Trehubov, Russia&apos;s numerical advantage in manpower in the area poses significant challenges. &quot;They are constantly conducting rotations, adding personnel, and replenishing their deployed forces. They still have this resource,&quot; Trehubov added. He said that preventing encirclement and maintaining access to Velyka Novosilka remains a priority for Ukrainian troops. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi previously described the ongoing Russian offensive in the east as &quot;one of the most powerful&quot; since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Throughout the fall of 2024, Russian forces made operational gains in southern Donetsk Oblast, including areas near Toretsk and Chasiv Yar, while advancing near Kupiansk and on Russian soil in Kursk Oblast. President Volodymyr Zelensky on Jan. 22 clarified his earlier comments on the number of European peacekeepers needed to maintain peace in Ukraine, saying the required numbers would depend on the size of Ukraine&#x2019;s own military. The statement comes after Zelensky told a journalist at the World Economic Forum in Davos that at least 200,000 European soldiers would be needed for a stable peace deal. &quot;By the way, I didn&#x2019;t say we need 200,000 (peacekeepers)... A journalist asked me, I said, &apos;maybe more, maybe less,&apos;&quot; Zelensky said when asked about the statement in an interview with Bloomberg TV. Zelensky spoke in comparably stronger terms in Davos, saying: &quot;From all the Europeans? 200,000, it&#x2019;s a minimum. It&#x2019;s a minimum, otherwise it&#x2019;s nothing.&quot; The president explained in the interview that the size of the needed contingent will depend on the strength of the Ukrainian military. As Kyiv would struggle to maintain a million-strong army needed to repel future Russian aggression, fielding such a force would depend on U.S. and European support, he explained. If the U.S. and Europe prove unwilling to help maintain such an army and Ukraine reduces it &quot;by 200,000, 300,000 or 500,000, it means that other troops have to replace them in those numbers,&quot; Zelensky added. The president&#x2019;s conclusion was that in the face of such options, Ukraine&#x2019;s accession to NATO is the cheapest way toward stable peace both for Ukraine and the West. At the same time, Zelensky admitted that some members &#x2013; namely the U.S., Germany, Slovakia, and Hungary &#x2013; remain reluctant to allow Ukraine into the alliance. Zelensky has been in contact with a number of European leaders about the prospects of a peacekeeping mission &#x2014; an initiative that French President Emmanuel Macron has spearheaded. During a visit to Kyiv on Jan. 16, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that his country will play its &quot;full part&quot; in supporting efforts to maintain an enduring peace in Ukraine. The idea has also found support from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called upon Europe to take up greater responsibility for Ukraine&#x2019;s security and pledged to bring a swift end to the war. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte called on the United States to continue supplying weapons to Ukraine, pledging that Europe will shoulder the financial burden, Reuters reported on Jan. 23. &quot;If this new Trump administration is willing to keep on supplying Ukraine, the bill will be paid by the Europeans,&quot; Rutte said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Rutte&apos;s remarks come amid the uncertainty of the U.S. support for Ukraine under President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticized aid to Kyiv, as well as called on Europe to increase its share. Trump has repeatedly lambasted European NATO members for not investing enough in their defense capabilities and instead relying on the U.S. Rutte agreed with Trump&apos;s criticism of Europe&apos;s low defense spending, saying that &quot;Ukraine is closer to Europe than to the U.S.&quot; Earlier on Jan. 22, President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized the importance of U.S. leadership in ending Russia&apos;s war during an interview with Bloomberg. &quot;The end of the war must be a victory for U.S. President Donald Trump, not for Russian President Vladimir Putin,&quot; Zelensky said. During his presidential campaign, Trump has repeatedly called for a swift resolution to Russia&apos;s war and claimed he would be able to end it quickly. However, he hasn&apos;t elaborated on how he plans to achieve that. On Jan. 22, Trump threatened to impose harsher sanctions on Moscow if a &quot;deal&quot; is not reached soon. President Donald Trump said on Jan. 23 that he would ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to lower the price of oil, claiming it would end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine &quot;immediately.&quot; &quot;If the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately,&quot; he said via videolink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. &quot;Right now, the price is high enough that that war will continue, you gotta bring down the oil price and end that war,&quot; he added. OPEC consists of 12 countries including Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, which collectively account for around 30% of the global oil supply. By agreeing to lower or raise the amount of oil they all produce, OPEC can dramatically affect global oil prices. Lower global oil prices would deplete Russia&apos;s main source of revenue that it uses to fund its war in Ukraine, though a recent analysis in Foreign Policy suggested any effects would likely take months to significantly hamper the Kremlin&apos;s war machine. Another Trump policy &#x2014; declaring open season on drilling for U.S. oil and gas &#x2014; could also potentially push down prices and box out Russian oil. Trump was also asked if there would be a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia by the time of next year&apos;s World Economic Forum. &quot;Well, you&apos;ll have to ask Russia. Ukraine is ready to make a deal,&quot; he said. Speaking of China, he said they &quot;have a great deal of power over that situation,&quot; and that he hoped the U.S. could work with Beijing to end the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A day earlier, Trump said that if a &quot;deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine was not reached soon, he would have no choice but to &quot;put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries.&quot; In response, the Kremlin said it sees nothing new in &#xA0;Trump&apos;s threats to impose sanctions if no deal on the war in Ukraine is reached, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Jan. 23. &quot;We don&apos;t see any particularly new elements here. You know that Trump, in the first iteration of his presidency, was the American president who most often resorted to sanctions methods,&quot; Peskov said. Russia is ready for an &quot;equal and respectful&quot; dialogue with the U.S., as it was during Trump&apos;s first term, Peskov added. The Kremlin spokesman also noted that no preparations are currently underway for a meeting between Trump and Putin. President Volodymyr Zelensky led a Ukrainian delegation at the World Economic Forum that sought to highlight the country&apos;s economic potential and investment appeal, framing the country as a &quot;prize, not a burden.&quot; Events held at the Ukraine House, the country&apos;s pavilion at the forum, have focused on Ukraine&apos;s vast natural resources, and defense and agricultural sectors. The delegation&apos;s website says Ukraine holds $26 trillion in mineral wealth, including one-third of Europe&apos;s lithium reserves and significant gas reserves.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russian-forces-suspected-of-killing-6-ukrainian-pows-in-donetsk-oblast/	2025-01-23T12:36:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2153450598.jpg
Russian actor who starred in propaganda films lands Oscar nomination	Russian actor Yura Borisov, who has previously starred in Russian propaganda films and illegally visited Russian-occupied Crimea, has received an Academy Award nomination for his role in the film &quot;Anora.&quot; Borisov is nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category, the U.S. Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced on Jan. 23. Borisov is the first Russian actor to land an Oscar nomination in nearly five decades. This recognition of a Russian actor who has never spoken out against Russia&apos;s aggression comes as Moscow continues to wage a brutal war against Ukraine, which has already killed tens of thousands of people, including at least 12,300 civilians. Directed by U.S. filmmaker Sean Baker, &quot;Anora&quot; is a modern-day reimagining of the Cinderella story set in Brighton Beach&apos;s Russian community. It follows a young sex worker from Brooklyn who impulsively marries the son of a Russian oligarch. The film has also been nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actress at the 97th Academy Awards. The Oscars ceremony will be held on March 2 this year. The nominees for Actor in a Supporting Role are... #Oscars pic.twitter.com/Um5Ba6mR0e Borisov is an acclaimed Russian actor who has starred in a number of Russian films promoting state propaganda, such as &quot;AK-47,&quot; which was partially filmed in occupied Crimea. Russia invaded and illegally annexed Ukraine&apos;s Crimean Peninsula in 2014. Entering Crimea from Russian territory is illegal. Since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion eight years later, Borisov hasn&apos;t publicly spoken out against his country&apos;s war of aggression. The decision has once again sparked a debate over the glorification of Russian culture and cooperation with Russians while Moscow is committing war crimes in Ukraine. Earlier in September, the Toronto International Film Festival sparked outrage for screening &quot;Russians at War,&quot; a documentary by a Russian-Canadian filmmaker that whitewashes Russian soldiers participating in the invasion of Ukraine. At this year&apos;s Oscars, the Ukrainian documentary &quot;Porcelain War&quot; is nominated for Best Documentary Feature. Directed by Brendan Bellomo and Slava Leontyev, the film tells the story of three Kharkiv artists who joined the Ukrainian army while continuing to create porcelain figurines as an act of cultural resistance during Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-actor-who-starred-in-propaganda-films-lands-oscar-nomination/	2025-01-23T12:18:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2188135413.jpg
Trump’s Ukraine war ultimatum sparks angry reaction from Russian milbloggers	Russian military bloggers, known as milbloggers, have responded in defiant terms to Donald Trump&#x2019;s ultimatum to his Russian counterpart, describing it as &quot;blackmail&quot; from a U.S. president acting more like a &quot;king of the playground.&quot; On Jan. 22, Trump called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to &quot;make a deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine, warning that failure to reach an agreement would lead to increased sanctions, tariffs, and taxes on Russian goods. Trump&#x2019;s statement comes after months of repeated claims he would quickly put an end to Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. Though it is still unknown how Trump plans to reach a deal between Russia and Ukraine, members of his team have made it clear that both sides will have to make concessions. In a typically bombastic post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump said he was &quot;not looking to hurt Russia&quot; and maintained he has &quot;always had a very good relationship&quot; with Putin. &quot;We can do it the easy way or the hard way &#x2014; and the easy way is always better,&quot; Trump wrote. &quot;It&apos;s time to make a deal. No more lives should be lost.&quot; The official Russian response was relatively measured, with Russia&apos;s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy saying Russia would have to determine what Trump means by &quot;deal&quot; before entering into negotiations. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Jan. 23 said Moscow didn&#x2019;t see &quot;any particularly new elements&quot; in what Trump said, but added Russia was ready for an &quot;equal and respectful&quot; dialogue with the U.S. But over on Telegram, a messenger app, Russian milbloggers were far more vocal in their opinions of Trump&#x2019;s ultimatum. Pro-Kremlin military bloggers are highly influential in the Russian media ecosystem, sharing insider war coverage and pro-war analysis of events, usually on Telegram. Highly nationalistic, the most prominent have followings in the hundreds of thousands, with some like Rybar having more than a million.

(Natalia Kolesnikova / AFP via Getty Images)German Kulikovsky/Starshe Eddy (Older than the Edda) Trump&apos;s ultimatum &#x2014; in the end, good old Donald is a typical American (salesman), not a politician. Nothing but lies in a fiery speech, all to sell an uninformed average person a completely unnecessary and very poor-quality product. When American astronauts land on Mars, and the Russian army loses a million soldiers killed in the war with &quot;khokhols&quot; (a derogatory word for Ukrainians) then maybe it will be worth considering his proposals. But for now, it&apos;s better to just shut the door or hang up the phone to avoid listening to what the salesman says about his junk. Everyone has already interpreted Trump&#x2019;s ultimatum to Russia however they please, but the meaning is the same &#x2014; either you do as I say, or I&#x2019;ll pressure you even harder with sanctions. As I wrote earlier, there can be no talk of peace. Russia cannot accept what is being offered to it, and Ukraine will not agree to what Russia demands of it. Ukraine should prepare for the complete destruction of its male population, and Russia for a long and grueling war. &apos;To make a deal&apos; &#x2014; an important and well-established American expression Trump took from business. Before the elections, he called Zelensky ineffective. That&#x2019;s the first point. Secondly&#x2026; this is a public ultimatum. How poorly Trump has studied the leadership of our country, to whom he is offering that very deal. Nothing will be agreed to under pressure.And thirdly &#x2014; why should Russia believe the Yankees this time, (believe) that they won&#x2019;t cheat us again? Trump is threatening Russia with new sanctions and the introduction of additional tariffs on Russian goods supplied to the U.S. if Russia doesn&#x2019;t end the special military operation. We&#x2019;ve already been through this under (former U.S. President Joe) Biden. Attempts to change Russia&apos;s position through primitive threats are unlikely to bring Trump the outcome he desires.

(Natalia Kolesnikova / AFP via Getty Images)Kotsnews (Aleksandr Kots) &#xA0;As we assumed, Trump&#x2019;s plan is an ultimatum and blackmail. Like I said, better to prepare for the worst. Biden&#x2019;s term will soon be remembered with nostalgia as a thaw. Remember this post. In a later post&#x2026; Perhaps Donald Trump is unaware, but Vladimir Putin belongs to the pre-TikTok era of global politics, where serious leaders discuss important issues through dialogue, not electronic notes. To express his vision for ending the war in Ukraine, Trump could, at the very least, pick up the phone. This (drama) with demands to make a deal or else sanctions, tariffs, and so on, is hardly appropriate. What exactly do we still trade with the U.S. that&#x2019;s critical to our budget? The last significant revenue stream came from uranium sales &#x2014; the U.S. imported a quarter of its nuclear fuel from Russia. But last May, Biden banned the import of our low-enriched uranium, and in November, Moscow responded by restricting enriched uranium exports to the U.S. Now you can freeze your ears off just to spite Uncle Sam. To be fair, Trump hasn&#x2019;t turned on this thug-like political mode exclusively toward Russia. Canada, Denmark, Panama, and Mexico are also taking hits from &quot;Bold Donnie&quot; and his team. Apparently, the heady success with Hamas (which was open to a ceasefire without threats from the American president) gave him a sense of omnipotence. Trump seems determined to come out looking like a winner no matter the situation. But Russia isn&#x2019;t Gaza. Starting a dialogue with ultimatums isn&#x2019;t the most farsighted move for a leader aiming to position himself as a peacemaker. Moscow will never agree to any deal dictated through blackmail and threats. In short, (it&#x2019;s a) fail, Donald Fredovich. Leave and return as a proper statesman representing a great power, not an overconfident &#x2018;king of the playground.&#x2019;	https://kyivindependent.com/king-of-the-playground-russian-mibloggers-react-to-trumps-war-in-ukraine-ultimatum/	2025-01-23T11:53:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194586652.jpg
UK, US sanctions force Russia's oil tankers to reflag, Bloomberg reports	A growing portion of Russia&apos;s oil tanker fleet is being forced to reflag as U.S. and U.K. sanctions intensify pressure on Moscow&apos;s shipping network, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 23. The removal of these flags disrupts Russia&apos;s oil export logistics, forcing tankers to re-register in less reputable jurisdictions and change ownership to avoid detection. The pressure follows sweeping sanctions introduced on Jan. 10, targeting nearly 200 vessels in Russia&apos;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet.&quot; These ships are used to bypass sanctions on Russian oil exports. The Barbados Ship Registry, which operates under U.K. regulations, will reportedly revoke the flags of 46 vessels under U.K. sanctions by the end of January. Though Barbados does not impose sanctions on Russia, its compliance reflects its strong ties with the U.K. Ships sanctioned by the U.S. but not by the U.K. will retain their Barbadian flags. Panama&apos;s Maritime Authority has similarly begun deregistering 68 vessels, aligning with U.S., EU, U.K., and UN sanctions under rules adopted in late 2024. Compounding the impact of maritime sanctions, Indian banks have reportedly blocked payments for Russian oil imports due to the latest round of U.S. sanctions, according to Energy Intelligence. The tightening measures have already caused a sharp decline in Russian seaborne crude exports, with Bloomberg reporting dozens of tankers dropping anchor and suspending operations since the Jan. 10 sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-and-us-sanctions-force-russias-oil-tankers-to-reflag-bloomberg-reports/	2025-01-23T10:44:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167101990.jpg
57% of Ukrainians believe peace without full territorial integrity will fail, poll shows	A majority of Ukrainians &#x2014; 57% &#x2014; believe any peace agreement that does not fully restore Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity is destined to fail, according to a survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published on Jan. 23. The survey revealed that this stance is shared across age groups, regions, and language practices. The poll, conducted between Nov. 22 and Jan. 7, reflects strong public sentiment as Russia&apos;s full-scale war approaches its third anniversary, with Moscow continuing its offensive in Ukraine&apos;s east. The researchers also noted a link between attitudes toward territorial integrity and perceptions of U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s new administration. Over half of respondents regard Trump&apos;s presidency positively, ranging from &quot;rather good&quot; to &quot;very good.&quot; But those who strongly or somewhat agree with the statement about territorial integrity are more likely to view Trump&apos;s presidency negatively. The survey&apos;s results were based on telephone interviews with 1,600 respondents residing in Ukraine-controlled territories. Expectations for possible peace talks in 2025 are rising, as Trump has vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table. Reports from the Wall Street Journal suggest his administration is weighing a plan to delay Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for continued Western arms supplies and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Dec. 26 that Russia aims to &quot;end the conflict&quot; in 2025, emphasizing hopes for front-line success. He expressed openness to dialogue with Trump but reiterated Russia&apos;s demands, including no territorial concessions.	https://kyivindependent.com/57-of-ukrainians-believe-peace-without-full-territorial-integrity-will-fail-survey-shows/	2025-01-23T10:38:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1347758762-1.jpg
Trump says Russia's war in Ukraine 'will end immediately' if OPEC lowers oil prices	President Donald Trump said on Jan. 23 he will ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to lower the price of oil, saying it would end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine &quot;immediately.&quot; &quot;If the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately,&quot; he said via videolink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. &quot;Right now the price is high enough that that war will continue, you gotta bring down the oil price and end that war,&quot; he added. OPEC consists of 12 countries including Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, which collectively account for around 30% of the global oil supply. By agreeing to lower or raise the amount of oil they all produce, OPEC can dramatically affect the global oil price. Lower global oil prices would deplete Russia&apos;s main source of revenue that it uses to fund its war in Ukraine, though a recent analysis in Foreign Policy suggested any effects would likely take months to significantly hamper the Kremlin&apos;s war machine. Another Trump policy &#x2014; declaring &#xA0;open season on drilling for U.S. oil and gas &#x2014; could also potentially push down prices and box out Russian oil. Trump was also asked if there would be a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia by the time of next year&apos;s World Economic Forum. &quot;Well you&apos;ll have to ask Russia. Ukraine is ready to make a deal,&quot; he said. Speaking of China, he said they &quot;have a great deal of power over that situation,&quot; and that he hoped the U.S. could work with Beijing to end the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A day earlier, Trump said that if a &quot;deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine was not reached soon, he would have no choice but to &quot;put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries.&quot; In response, the Kremlin said it sees nothing new in &#xA0;Trump&apos;s threats to impose sanctions if no deal on the war in Ukraine is reached, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Jan. 23. &quot;We don&apos;t see any particularly new elements here. You know that Trump, in the first iteration of his presidency, was the American president who most often resorted to sanctions methods,&quot; Peskov said. Russia is ready for an &quot;equal and respectful&quot; dialogue with the U.S., as it was during Trump&apos;s first term, Peskov added. The Kremlin spokesman also noted that no preparations are currently underway for a meeting between Trump and Putin. President Volodymyr Zelensky led a Ukrainian delegation at the World Economic Forum that sought to highlight the country&apos;s economic potential and investment appeal, framing the country as a &quot;prize, not a burden. Events held at the Ukraine House, the country&apos;s pavilion at the forum, have focused on Ukraine&apos;s vast natural resources, and defense and agricultural sectors. The delegation&apos;s website says Ukraine holds $26 trillion in mineral wealth, including one-third of Europe&apos;s lithium reserves and significant gas reserves.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-says-russias-war-in-ukraine-will-end-immediately-if-opec-lowers-oil-prices/	2025-01-23T09:35:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194855272.jpg
NATO chief urges US to keep arming Ukraine, pledges European funding	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte called on the United States to continue supplying weapons to Ukraine, pledging that Europe will shoulder the financial burden, Reuters reported on Jan. 23. &quot;If this new Trump administration is willing to keep on supplying Ukraine, the bill will be paid by the Europeans,&quot; Rutte said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Rutte&apos;s remarks come amid the uncertainty of the U.S. support for Ukraine under President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticized aid to Kyiv, as well as called on Europe to increase its share. Trump has repeatedly lambasted European NATO members for not investing enough in their defense capabilities and instead relying on the U.S. Rutte agreed with Trump&apos;s criticism of Europe&apos;s low defense spending, saying that &quot;Ukraine is closer to Europe than to the U.S.&quot; Earlier on Jan. 22, President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized the importance of U.S. leadership in ending Russia&apos;s war during an interview with Bloomberg. &quot;The end of the war must be a victory for U.S. President Donald Trump, not for Russian President Vladimir Putin,&quot; Zelensky said. During his presidential campaign, Trump has repeatedly called for a swift resolution to Russia&apos;s war and claimed he would be able to end it quickly. However, he hasn&apos;t elaborated on how he plans to achieve that. On Jan. 22, Trump threatened to impose harsher sanctions on Moscow if a &quot;deal&quot; is not reached soon.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-chief-urges-us-to-keep-arming-ukraine-pledges-european-funding-media-reports/	2025-01-23T08:11:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2188184447.jpg
Kyiv Independent identifies high-ranking Russian officer, officials involved in looting of museums in southern Ukraine	The Kyiv Independent identified a Russian military officer and three Russian-appointed officials from occupied Crimea who were responsible for the illegal removal of artworks and artifacts from two Kherson museums in the fall of 2022. Fleeing a Ukrainian counteroffensive, Russian forces collectively stole more than 33,000 historical artifacts and works of art. This museum theft is the largest in Europe since World War II. Those who oversaw the theft are Dmitry Lipov, head of the communications center of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, who served as the city&apos;s commandant during the occupation of Kherson, Sergey Patrushev, appointed by the Russian authorities to head the museum department of the so-called Crimean Ministry of Culture, Elena Morozova and Mikhail Smorodkin, appointed by the Russian authorities as directors of the Crimean museums, Tauric Chersonese and the Museum of Defense of Sevastopol. The findings are the basis for the Kyiv Independent&apos;s War Crimes Investigation Unit&apos;s documentary &quot;Curated Theft.&quot; To identify those who took part in the government-sanctioned theft, the Kyiv Independent journalist posed as a Russian TV producer and as a Russian investigator to communicate with local collaborators who helped Russian troops loot. The Kyiv Independent found that Russian officer Lipov was responsible for securing the collections during their removal and personally sealed the trucks that carried the stolen items. Patrushev was responsible for moving paintings from the Kherson Art Museum to occupied Crimea. The directors of the Crimean museums chose items from the Kherson Local History museum&apos;s collection during the looting. The Kyiv Independent also found that the illegal removal of collections from Kherson to occupied Crimea was supervised by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB).	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-independent-identifies-high-ranking-russian-officer-officials-involved-in-looting-of-museums-in-southern-ukraine/	2025-01-23T08:06:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1245781943.jpg
Russia’s looting of history is a theft of who we are	I first visited the looted museums of Kherson, a city in southern Ukraine, in May 2024. At the time, my team at the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s War Crimes Investigations Unit and I were beginning an investigation into the illegal export of artifacts from Kherson to occupied Crimea by Russian forces amid the full-scale war. Over 33,000 works of art and historical artifacts had been stolen from local museums in the fall of 2022, just before the city was liberated from Russian occupation by the Ukrainian military. I went to Kherson thinking that I had already seen so much horror, human tragedy, and pain during two years of the full-scale invasion that I could hardly be affected by the sight of looted museum halls. But when I entered the local history museum, for a few minutes, everything inside me went numb. The large exhibition halls were completely empty, and the display cases that once housed artifacts from the Scythians, Goths, Romans, and Greeks were shattered. The museum director led me to a hall that had been especially significant to the staff and guests. This separate room had displayed gold jewelry from the Scythians and Sarmatians, peoples who inhabited Ukrainian lands thousands of years ago. All that remained of these treasures were the text descriptions on the display cases. I&#x2019;ve known about the Scythians since childhood. I was born and raised in Ukraine&#x2019;s Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, home to the most famous Scythian burial mounds. These ancient graves of a nomadic people have yielded unique gold jewelry and household items through centuries of excavation. In the 20th century, one of these mounds revealed the legendary Golden Pectoral, an ornate decoration belonging to a Scythian aristocrat, which became one of Ukraine&#x2019;s most renowned treasures. I learned about their culture and history in local history lessons at school. After Kherson&#x2019;s liberation, a guard at the local history museum told reporters that Russian forces hadn&#x2019;t just taken valuables &#x2014; they had stolen the Ukrainian soul. The moment I first saw the looted halls, I understood exactly what he meant. I felt as though they had taken part of my Ukrainian identity too. Systematic attacks on Ukrainian culture have been part of Russian state policy since czarist times. In the early 20th century, this practice was adopted by the Bolsheviks, and in the 21st century, it continues with modern Russia. For instance, journalists from Ukrainian outlet Texty analyzed electronic catalogs of two major Russian museums &#x2014; the Hermitage and the State Historical Museum &#x2014; and found over 110,000 items in their collections that originated from modern Ukraine. Many artifacts lack detailed information about their origins, such as the archaeological site or place of discovery. To confirm these items&#x2019; ties to Ukraine, journalists conducted additional research. These artifacts were appropriated during both the Russian Empire and Soviet times. Russia hasn&#x2019;t just looted Ukrainian cultural artifacts; it has also physically eliminated Ukrainian intelligentsia. In the 1920s and 1930s, Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin&#x2019;s regime destroyed an entire generation of Ukrainian artists &#x2014; painters, writers, and directors &#x2014; later called the &#x201C;Executed Renaissance.&#x201D; I have no doubt these actions aim to erase Ukrainian identity. And I know from personal experience how this works. I am a Ukrainian who grew up in a Russified region. Both my grandmothers were born in Ukrainian-speaking families, but my first words were in Russian. As a child, I received New Year&#x2019;s gifts from Father Frost, a character invented by Soviet propaganda, instead of Saint Nicholas, as my ancestors had. I went to school in independent Ukraine, but in music lessons, we sang Soviet songs, like those about Mykola Shchors, a Bolshevik military commander. At the same time, I knew nothing about Mykola Leontovych, the Ukrainian composer who wrote the world-famous &#x201C;Carol of the Bells.&#x201D; I became interested in Ukrainian literature during my student years. That interest expanded to Ukrainian art, especially cinema. I began attending exhibitions of Ukrainian artists and performances by Ukrainian theater directors. Eventually, I abandoned the Russian language entirely. Now, my family and I are reviving Ukrainian traditions. This year, for the first time, I replaced the traditional Christmas tree with a &#x201C;didukh,&#x201D; a Ukrainian Christmas decoration made of wheat. Still, I am on a journey to rediscover my culture and history &#x2014; like millions of other Ukrainians. The more we return to our roots, the harder Russia hits. It loots museums, destroys architectural monuments, and Russifies Ukrainian children in Russian-occupied territories. Its goal is clear: to erase everything Ukrainian and turn the Ukrainian state into a colony once again.

Ukrainian soldiers near Velyka Novosilka at risk of encirclement, spokesperson says	Ukrainian troops positioned near the village of Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk Oblast are at risk of encirclement by Russian forces, military spokesperson Viktor Trehubov said on Jan. 23. Russian forces are attempting to take control of access routes to the village through heavy fire, according to Trehubov, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces. &quot;Velyka Novosilka is currently in a rather difficult situation. Ukrainian soldiers are doing everything to prevent further advances of the enemy,&quot; Trehubov said. However, the geographical layout of the area, including a river that cuts through the village, complicates defensive maneuvers, according to Trehubov. A screenshot of the map by the DeepState monitoring group as of Jan. 23, 2025, showing the front-line village of Velyka Novosilka, Donetsk Oblast. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)According to Trehubov, Russia&apos;s numerical advantage in manpower in the area poses significant challenges. &quot;They are constantly conducting rotations, adding personnel, and replenishing their deployed forces. They still have this resource,&quot; Trehubov added. He said that preventing encirclement and maintaining access to Velyka Novosilka remains a priority for Ukrainian troops. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi previously described the ongoing Russian offensive in the east as &quot;one of the most powerful&quot; since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Throughout the fall of 2024, Russian forces made operational gains in southern Donetsk Oblast, including areas near Toretsk and Chasiv Yar, while advancing near Kupiansk and on Russian soil in Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-soldiers-near-velyka-novosilka-at-risk-of-encirclement-spokesperson-says/	2025-01-23T07:26:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1618591092.jpg
Ukraine's central bank raises key policy rate to 14.5% due to inflation	Ukraine&apos;s National Bank (NBU) announced on Jan. 23 that it will raise the key policy rate from 13.5% to 14.5% per annum starting from Jan. 24. The Ukrainian economy was heavily hit by Russia&apos;s full-scale war. At the start of the invasion, inflation skyrocketed to 26.6% in 2022 from 10.0% in 2021. It subsided the following year but in 2024, the inflation again accelerated to 12%, exceeding NBU&apos;s forecast. &quot;In order to maintain the stability of the foreign exchange market, keep expectations under control, and gradually bring inflation to the 5% target on the policy horizon, the NBU Board decided to raise the key policy rate by 1% to 14.5%,&quot; chairman Andrii Pyshnyi said in a press briefing. The NBU raised its key policy rate to 10% in January 2022. It had remained unchanged since the beginning of the all-out war, but on June 3, 2022, the rate grew from 10% to 25%. For over a year, it remained at the same level, dropping to 22% in July 2023 and following a gradual decline. In December 2024, the NBU raised the key policy rate from 13% to 13.5% in response to inflationary developments. According to Pyshnyi, the NBU will likely continue &quot;tightening interest rate policy if signs of sustained inflationary pressure and the threat of imbalance in inflation expectations persist.&quot; Inflation is likely to continue rising in the first months of 2025, peaking in the second quarter and then starting to decline in the middle of the year. According to the NBU&apos;s forecast, inflation will slow to 8.4% by the end of 2025 and to 5% in 2026. &quot;This will be supported by the NBU&apos;s interest rate and exchange rate policies, as well as by higher harvests, an improvement in the energy sector, a reduction in the fiscal deficit, and moderate external price pressure,&quot; NBU&apos;s statement read.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-national-bank-raises-key-policy-rate-by-1-due-to-inflation/	2025-01-23T06:08:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1401596737.jpg
Trump needs to come out on top' — Zelensky on US president's role in ending war	The end of the war must be a victory for U.S. President Donald Trump, not for Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview for Bloomberg TV on Jan. 22. Zelensky&apos;s statement comes amid Trump&apos;s calls for an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and recent threats to impose sanctions on Moscow if a &quot;deal&quot; is not reached soon. &quot;I think the issue of ending the war in Ukraine must be a victory for Trump, not for Putin. Putin is nobody for him. America is much stronger, Europe is much stronger, China is stronger than Russia. They are all players,&quot; Zelensky told Bloomberg TV. Zelensky added that the war showed Russia&apos;s inability to fully occupy Ukraine. &quot;They (Russia) are big, they have a lot of weapons, and they don&apos;t spare people,&quot; he said. &quot;We are specifically defending Europe, NATO countries. And Putin will go there.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s why Trump needs to come out on top. And he is capable of doing so.&quot; According to Zelensky, Trump must conclude such an agreement that will prevent Putin from resuming the aggression further down the line. The Ukrainian president also noted that &quot;everyone should have a plan&quot; before they start communicating directly with Putin. Trump has signaled his intent to meet Putin &quot;very quickly&quot; after taking office. While the Kremlin welcomed the remarks, it noted that no preparations for the meeting are currently underway. Trump&apos;s team is reportedly working on arranging a call with Putin shortly after the inauguration, with the goal of initiating a settlement plan for the war in Ukraine within the first months of his presidency. The U.S. president&#x2019;s team Trump aims to preserve Ukraine&apos;s independence, though U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that both Kyiv and Moscow would have to make concessions to achieve a peace deal.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-needs-to-come-out-on-top-zelensky-on-us-presidents-role-in-ending-war-in-ukraine/	2025-01-23T05:42:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169777527.jpg
To ban Tchaikovsky or not, that is the question	In 2022, Lithuania&#x2019;s then-Culture Minister Simonas Kairys decided that performing Russian composer Pyotr Illyich Tchaikovsky&#x2019;s classic ballet &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; was no longer an appropriate way to celebrate the Christmas season. Lithuania is a staunch supporter of Ukraine, and Kairys, believing that Russian culture could not be separated from Russian imperialism, called for a &#x201C;mental quarantine&#x201D; &#x2014; otherwise known as &#x201C;cultural decolonization.&#x201D; At the end of last year, &#x160;ar&#x16B;nas Birutis, the newly installed culture minister, announced that he liked Tchaikovsky&#x2019;s music and saw no reason to prohibit it. Some Lithuanians agree, including another former minister of culture, who said: &#x201C;We fought Soviet power to get the freedom not to ban things.&#x201D; The Nutcracker debate in Lithuania echoes similar, though usually more fraught, arguments in Ukraine. In 2023, the Kyiv City Council decided that Russian music, plays, books, and art should no longer be showcased in public. Statues of Alexander Pushkin, one of Russia&#x2019;s greatest poets, were removed from public places. The patriotic urge to ban works of art associated with an enemy country is not new, of course. During World War I, some British people wanted to prohibit the performance of German music in concert halls, and there was even a proposal to replace German-made pianos with British-made models. When World War II came around, music played a very different role in Britain. The celebrated British pianist Myra Hess performed her famous lunchtime concerts in London during the Blitz. Hess, who was Jewish, saw no problem with playing music by the great German composers. To her, and to the Londoners who flocked to hear her, Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach belonged to the world, not to Germany alone. In Nazi Germany, the same music was performed on official occasions, such as Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s birthday, to demonstrate the superiority of German culture. Wilhelm Furtw&#xE4;ngler, the most famous German conductor at the time, would not have disagreed about the exalted status of German music, but he was not a Nazi. In his view, great music lifted people above politics and wartime propaganda, hence his refusal to leave his home country, or to stop performing there. German conductor and composer Wilhelm Furtwaengler acknowledges the applause of the audience after a concert by the Berlin Philharmonic in Berlin, Germany, on Jan.1, 1933. In the front row are (L-R) Herman Goering, Adolf Hitler, and Josef Goebbels. (Getty Images)The Nazis never banned all &#x201C;enemy culture&#x201D; either. Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays were performed in Germany throughout World War II, although &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; posed some problems: Shylock, the Jewish moneylender, might evoke a little too much sympathy. One of the aims of wartime propaganda is to demonize the enemy and portray them as less than human. Hollywood movies had been very popular in Japan (and in Germany) until December 1941. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese propaganda portrayed Americans as &#x201C;devils and beasts,&#x201D; and their devilish and beastly cultural products were swiftly taken out of circulation. So, is banning the art of another country ever a good idea? In principle, no. Tchaikovsky cannot be held responsible for Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s war of aggression. Withholding great works of art from the public will have a narrowing, provincializing effect. Artists like Ludwig van Beethoven, William Shakespeare, and Leo Tolstoy transcend borders. And yet, perhaps the Ukrainians should be given some slack. Britain was not in danger of being dominated by German culture during WWII, let alone forcibly assimilated into it. Putin&#x2019;s vision of building a broader &quot;Russkiy mir&quot; (Russian world) in which peripheral countries are subservient to the Kremlin, and their cultures are reduced to folkloric dances on official occasions, poses a fundamental threat to Ukraine&#x2019;s survival as an independent nation-state. To speak of cultural decolonization suggests a parallel between Ukraine and the former European colonies in Asia and Africa, where some local elites were indeed Anglicized or Francicized. But a better comparison would be to Korea under the Japanese Empire between 1910 and 1945. During this period, Koreans were not so much colonial subjects as widely despised second-class citizens. In the later stages of Japan&#x2019;s imperial rule, Koreans were forced to adopt Japanese names and be educated in Japanese. After Japan&#x2019;s defeat in World War II, Koreans, nearly robbed of their identity, also narrowed their cultural horizon by rejecting all things Japanese. It was only in the 1990s that Japanese movies, comic books, pop music, and literature began to re-enter South Korea, and they were not always well received. To those of us who espouse the principle of universal humanism, this kind of cultural chauvinism might seem provincial, if not bigoted. But Koreans were once fighting for their survival as a people. Culture was an existential matter. The same is true for Ukrainians today. Shunning Russian music, art, and literature, despite having deep historic links with such works, will not do much for universal humanism in Ukraine. But Ukrainians have more pressing concerns: they must fight to maintain their own distinct language and culture, as well as their own government. Once they secure their sovereignty, neither they, nor indeed the Lithuanians, will have any reason to fear Pushkin&#x2019;s poetry or Tchaikovsky&#x2019;s music.

Syrskyi sees 'gradual' improvement in scandal-hit French-trained brigade's capabilities	Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Jan. 23 that the French-trained 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Brigade is &quot;gradually acquiring certain combat capabilities&quot; after reports of poor command and training. The unit became a center of controversy after the Censor.net outlet uncovered rampant cases of mismanagement that led to high rates of losses and desertions. The brigade was deployed at the Pokrovsk sector, the most critical section of the front in Donetsk Oblast, in November 2024. &quot;All negative aspects and difficulties that arose during... (the brigade&#x2019;s) deployment in Ukraine have been analyzed, and the conclusions will be taken into account during the further training of service members,&quot; Syrskyi said after discussion with officers during his visit to the Pokrovsk sector. Censor.net&apos;s chief editor, Yurii Butusov, laid the blame for the brigade&apos;s poor performance on the Ukrainian military and political leadership, saying that France provided all the necessary support . Similarly, Syrskyi thanked France for being &quot;the first country to respond to the request to create a mechanized brigade and fulfilled all its obligations regarding the training and equipment.&quot; The scandal cast doubt on Ukraine&apos;s initiative to build fresh new brigades that would be trained and supplied with the support of Western partners. The 155th Brigade was to be the flagship unit of this project. Ukrainian authorities have launched an investigation into the brigade&apos;s mismanagement, with its former commander being reportedly detained earlier this week.	https://kyivindependent.com/syrskyi-sees-gradual-improvement-in-scandal-ridden-155th-brigades-capabilities/	2025-01-23T05:27:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1550396164.jpg
Zelensky clarifies comment on 200,000 peacekeepers, says figure depends on Ukrainian army size	President Volodymyr Zelensky on Jan. 23 clarified his earlier comments on the number of European peacekeepers needed to maintain peace in Ukraine, saying the required numbers would depend on the size of Ukraine&#x2019;s own military. The statement comes after Zelensky told a journalist at the World Economic Forum in Davos that at least 200,000 European soldiers would be needed for a stable peace deal. &quot;By the way, I didn&#x2019;t say we need 200,000 (peacekeepers)... A journalist asked me, I said, &apos;maybe more, maybe less,&apos;&quot; Zelensky said when asked about the statement in an interview with Bloomberg TV. Zelensky spoke in comparably stronger terms in Davos, saying: &quot;From all the Europeans? 200,000, it&#x2019;s a minimum. It&#x2019;s a minimum, otherwise it&#x2019;s nothing.&quot; The president explained in the interview that the size of the needed contingent will depend on the strength of the Ukrainian military. As Kyiv would struggle to maintain a million-strong army needed to repel a future Russian aggression, fielding such a force would depend on U.S. and European support, he explained. If the U.S. and Europe prove unwilling to help maintain such an army and Ukraine reduces it &quot;by 200,000, 300,000 or 500,000, it means that other troops have to replace them in those numbers,&quot; Zelensky added. The president&#x2019;s conclusion was that in the face of such options, Ukraine&#x2019;s accession to NATO is the cheapest way toward stable peace both for Ukraine and the West. At the same time, Zelensky admitted that some members &#x2013; namely the U.S., Germany, Slovakia, and Hungary &#x2013; remain reluctant to allow Ukraine into the alliance. Zelensky has been in contact with a number of European leaders about the prospects of a peacekeeping mission &#x2014; an initiative that French President Emmanuel Macron has spearheaded. During a visit to Kyiv on Jan. 16, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that his country will play its &quot;full part&quot; in supporting efforts to maintain an enduring peace in Ukraine. The idea has also found support from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called upon Europe to take up greater responsibility for Ukraine&#x2019;s security and pledged to bring a swift end to the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-clarifies-comment-on-200-000-peacekeepers/	2025-01-23T04:58:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194672328.jpg
Kremlin sees 'no new elements' in Trump's statement on sanctions against Russia	The Kremlin sees nothing new in U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s threats to impose sanctions if no deal on the war in Ukraine is reached, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Jan. 23 during his press briefing. A day earlier, Trump said that if a &quot;deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine was not reached soon, he would have no choice but to &quot;put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries.&quot; &quot;We don&apos;t see any particularly new elements here. You know that Trump, in the first iteration of his presidency, was the American president who most often resorted to sanctions methods,&quot; Peskov said. Russia is ready for an &quot;equal and respectful&quot; dialogue with the U.S., as it was during Trump&apos;s first term, Peskov added. The Kremlin spokesman also noted that no preparations are currently underway for a meeting between Trump and Putin. During the election campaign, Trump promised to end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours, though his choice for special Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, has since revised this to 100 days. The Trump team hopes to quickly begin work on a settlement plan that could be implemented within the first few months of his presidency. A meeting with Putin is part of the plan, according to CNN. Trump has often voiced sympathies for the Russian leader while criticizing the level of support the outgoing Biden administration gave to Kyiv. This prompted concerns that the new U.S. leadership might cut a deal unfavorable to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-sees-no-new-elements-in-trumps-statement-on-sanctions-against-russia/	2025-01-23T04:10:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245735181.jpeg
Russian cargo ship Sparta II docks in Syria after weeks drifting at sea, tracking data shows	A Russian cargo ship supposed to evacuate Russian military equipment from Russia&apos;s Tartus naval base in Syria has finally docked after spending weeks drifting in the Mediterranean, MarineTraffic data showed on Jan. 22. The Sparta II, a Russian cargo ship under U.S. sanctions, had been drifting near Tartus since Jan. 5 after leaving Baltiysk in Kaliningrad Oblast on Dec. 11. Following the December overthrow of Russian-backed dictator Bashar al-Assad by rebel forces, the new Syrian authorities refused to grant entry to the ship. Reports indicate that Russian forces have dismantled air defense radars and moved over 100 trucks of equipment to the port, but without access for Russian ships, personnel and equipment had been left stranded. The Insider reported on Jan. 21 that Syrian authorities had finally granted permission for the ship to dock, and MarineTraffic data shows it moored at Tartus as of Jan. 23. A circle marks the postion of the Sparta II on Jan. 23 as shown on MarineTraffic.com (MarineTraffic)But while Russia may now be able to evacuate some of its personnel and equipment, the Kremlin&apos;s long term presence at the Mediterranean port was thrown into doubt earlier this week when Syria canceled Russia&apos;s 49-year operating lease for Tartus. The contract, signed in 2019, had committed Moscow to invest at least $500 million in modernizing the port. With the agreement now void, all revenues from the port&apos;s operations will go directly to the Syrian state, and its management will revert to local authorities. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha addressed Russia&#x2019;s military presence in Syria during a Dec. 30 diplomatic visit to Damascus. According to Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi, Ukraine and the new Syrian leadership share similar views on the matter, though specific details were not disclosed.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-cargo-ship-sparta-ii-docks-in-syria-after-weeks-drifting-in-mediterranean/	2025-01-23T04:10:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screen-Shot-2025-01-23-at-13_21_06.png
Putin increasingly concerned about state of Russia’s economy, Reuters reports	Russian President Vladimir Putin appears increasingly concerned about the country&apos;s economy as U.S. President Donald Trump calls for an end to the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported on Jan. 23, citing five undisclosed sources. Throughout the nearly three years of full-scale invasion, Ukraine&apos;s Western partners imposed heavy sanctions on Moscow to undermine its ability to wage war. Initially, Russia has largely weather the sanctions, circumventing economic restrictions through third-party countries and various loopholes. The situation appears to be shifting as Russia has faced mounting economic challenges over the past months, compounded by labor shortages and military spending-induced inflation that led to record interest rates. Putin insisted that Russia would continue to fight as long as necessary and would not compromise its interests. At the same time, the Russian president acknowledged the pressure on the economy caused by the war, Reuters reported, citing its undisclosed source. Putin was also dissatisfied with the decline in private investment due to the high cost of credit. During a meeting with Russian business leaders in December, the president chided the economic bloc&apos;s top officials, according to two sources. In 2025, Russia has increased defense spending to a post-Soviet record level of 6.3% of GDP, which is one-third of budget expenditures, causing inflation. The economic situation in Russia has pushed some of the Russian elite to seek a negotiated settlement to the war, according to two sources familiar with the Kremlin&apos;s views. Trump has yet to present a detailed plan for peace in Ukraine, despite campaigning on promises to put a swift end to the conflict. While he frequently references his good relationship with Putin, his recent comments on Moscow have taken a somewhat harder line. The U.S. president recently urged Putin to &quot;make a deal&quot; on Ukraine, threatening with &quot;high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries&quot; if he fails to do so. Russia has thus far dismissed any reported peace proposals from the Trump administration and maintained its ambitions to fully occupy four Ukrainian regions &#x2014;Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. Trump has said that arrangements for a face-to-face meeting with Putin are currently underway.	https://kyivindependent.com/putins-concerns-about-russias-economy-growing-amid-trumps-calls-for-wars-end-reuters-reports/	2025-01-23T03:49:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1246326347.jpg
Russian forces suspected of killing 6 Ukrainian POWs in Donetsk Oblast	Ukrainian prosecutors are investigating a case of Russian troops summarily executing six Ukrainian captives in the embattled Donetsk Oblast, the Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office said on Jan. 23. The statement came in reaction to a video circulating on social media, recorded by Russian soldiers, that apparently shows the execution of the six prisoners of war (POW). Footage also shows a seventh Ukrainian soldier lying on the ground, whose fate is unknown. &quot;According to preliminary information, during an assault against Ukrainian positions in Donetsk Oblast, Russian soldiers took six Ukrainian soldiers captives and subsequently shot them,&quot; the Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office said in a statement. Executing prisoners of war is a serious violation of the Geneva Conventions and a war crime. Ukraine&#x2019;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said he had reached out to the U.N. and the International Committee of the Red Cross regarding the case. Throughout the full-scale war, Ukraine has documented widespread violations of the Geneva Conventions by Russian forces, including the execution of over 100 POWs in 2024 alone, according to Lubinets. Reports of torture, murder, and abuse of Ukrainian captives &#x2014; particularly in Donetsk Oblast &#x2014; have surged in recent months. Visual evidence of these atrocities continues to emerge, underscoring Russia&apos;s disregard for international law.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-apparently-kill-6-ukrainian-pows-in-donetsk-oblast/	2025-01-23T03:25:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2153450598.jpg
North Korea to send artillery units, 150 more ballistic missiles to aid Russia’s war, Budanov says	North Korea is expected to send reinforcements to Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, mainly gun and rocket artillery units, Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said in an interview with The War Zone magazine published on Jan. 23. Pyongyang is also expected to send 150 short-range KN-23 ballistic missiles to Russia in 2025, in addition to the 148 already supplied in 2024, according to the spy chief. Moscow is further set to receive additional 170 mm M1989 Koksan self-propelled artillery guns and M-1991 240 mm multiple launch rocket systems, Budanov noted, adding that North Korea provided 120 pieces of each of these systems in the past three months. The North Korean soldiers are expected to train their Russian counterparts on the supplied systems, he said. North Korea has shaped up to be Russia&#x2019;s key supporter in its war against Ukraine, providing extensive artillery ammunition, missiles, and a contingent of 12,000 troops who had joined Russia in assaults against the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast. Kyiv has said that North Korean troops have already suffered 4,000 casualties, though the number cannot be independently verified. Budanov did not provide further details on the number of North Korean reinforcements or the timeframe of their arrival. The New York Times reported that according to an undisclosed U.S. official, fresh Pyongyang troops could arrive within two months. Experts interviewed by the Kyiv Independent connected North Korea&#x2019;s high casualty rates to a lack of experience with modern warfare, the &quot;human wave&quot; tactics employed against entrenched Ukrainian positions, and the resolve of North Korean troops to avoid capture, even at the cost of their own lives. Only two North Korean soldiers are in Ukrainian captivity since Pyongyang deployed its troops in Kursk Oblast last fall. Russia has ramped up its efforts to push Ukrainian forces out of their positions in Kursk Oblast, held since early August 2024. The region is expected to play a key role in any negotiations amid U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s push for peace talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-to-send-artillery-units-150-ballistic-missiles-to-aid-russias-war-budanov-says/	2025-01-23T02:40:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2037956412.jpg
US podcaster Fridman plans to visit Russia, interview Putin after criticizing Zelensky	U.S. podcaster Lex Friedman plans to visit Russia to interview Russian President Vladimir Putin, Fridman said on Jan. 22 at Joe Rogan&apos;s podcast. The podcaster previously interviewed President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv. Following the interview, Fridman criticized the Ukrainian president on X, saying that Zelensky had spoken &quot;crude words&quot; towards Putin and that this would not facilitate negotiations. &quot;There&apos;s probably a lot to say about this war. I should say that I interviewed Volodymyr Zelensky, and I will be traveling to Russia to interview Vladimir Putin, and I&apos;m aware of the risks; I accept the risks, and the goal of the mission is just to push for peace,&quot; Fridman said on the podcast The Joe Rogan Experience. Fridman did not specify when he would visit Russia or whether he had already agreed to an interview with the Russian authorities. The Kremlin has not commented on Fridman&apos;s statement. The podcaster also added that he believes that U.S. President Donald Trump is capable of bringing peace closer. &quot;I think that both Zelensky and Putin fear Donald Trump. And that&apos;s a great person to then make peace. All of them believe, both Putin and Zelensky, that Trump would do some crazy shit,&quot; he said. With nearly five million subscribers on his YouTube channel, Fridman, born in Tajikistan and raised in Moscow, organized an interview with Zelensky that was published on Jan. 5 as part of what he described as his &quot;small part in pushing for peace.&quot; Fridman&apos;s show has previously hosted controversial figures, including Trump, entrepreneur Elon Musk, political commentator Vivek Ramaswamy, and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, some of whom have advanced narratives portraying Ukraine as a corrupt nation bent on escalating war with Russia. In a three-hour interview, Fridman tried to persuade Zelensky that Putin is &quot;a serious person who loves his country.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/fridman-plans-to-interview-putin/	2025-01-23T02:22:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1239295205-1.jpg
Ukraine is failing the mobilization test	Ukrainian society largely does not want to mobilize. Nearly 6 million Ukrainian men have not updated their information in military enlistment centers, and most of them likely don&apos;t have grounds for a deferment or exemption. Forced mobilization of these men is categorically opposed by society. Rosy-cheeked aunts gather and shout &quot;shame&quot; at military enlistment officers tasked with searching for draft dodgers. Society is also resistant to the mobilization of 25-year-old &quot;children.&quot; However, this sentiment does not extend to the sons of elites and deputies, who are readily and unhesitatingly deemed fit for the front lines. &quot;Let (former Ukrainian President Petro) Poroshenko&apos;s and (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky&apos;s sons fight,&quot; they say. There is also a reluctance to pay more taxes &#x2014; and I&#x2019;m not even addressing the other duties or requirements imposed during martial law. Furthermore, society is adamantly against sending soldiers from other branches of the military into infantry. Being in the infantry is not seen as an honor for Ukrainian soldiers but as something dirty and undignified &#x2014; a form of punishment. At the same time, society strongly opposes sending poorly trained recruits into infantry. Ten years of war and three years of full-scale invasion weren&apos;t enough to prepare Ukrainian men. Now, they must undergo at least six months of preparation, preferably abroad, where it&apos;s easier to avoid service. One can talk endlessly about drone warfare and a shortage of equipment and artillery, but it&apos;s the infantry that holds the front line. The front line stretches 3,000 kilometers, with active combat continuing on a third of it. Society is unwilling to answer the question of where the military command should find the personnel to maintain the line against a vastly superior enemy &#x2014; let the government solve this, but without mobilizing anyone and, God forbid, calling up 25-year-olds. Let the MPs, prosecutors, and police officers go to war. Never mind that there aren&apos;t enough MPs and prosecutors to form even one regiment, and police officers have already been fighting with full brigades from the start. Society has failed the test of maturity. The political opposition battles the government as though elections are just around the corner, despite the fact that elections cannot be held during martial law. Instead of seeking compromises with the opposition, the government prefers to keep political traitors and collaborators on a leash, cooperating with them while losing more and more credibility.

(Kostiantyn Liberov / Libkos / Getty Images)A Ukrainian soldier stands in a trench near Bakhmut, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on Oct. 25, 2023. (Kostya Liberov / Libkos / Getty Images)One can rightfully criticize the government for its failures. It&#x2019;s fair, they exist. But the government is a reflection of the views and politics of society. There is no demand for mobilization, and thus there is no adequate mobilization policy. There is no demand to transition the country&#x2019;s economy to a wartime footing, and so there are no corresponding unpopular decisions. However, the issue of the enemy&#x2019;s total advantage in infantry remains unresolved. Yes, our partners are right. If we want the world to protect democracy in Ukraine, Ukrainians themselves must be the first to defend our democracy. There will be no negotiations on terms that suit us while the enemy continues to seize more and more territory. It&#x2019;s time to remove the rose-colored glasses. The West favors strong partners, but as we retreat daily, we are not seen as strong, no matter how much weapons and money we receive. They are telling us this directly. Are there issues with military management? Of course. But if you believe this is some secret plan by spies working for the enemy within our General Staff, I pity you. That&#x2019;s conspiracy theory-level thinking, like believing the Earth is flat. What reforms can we talk about when the only goal of the military command is to hold the front line from collapsing and prevent the enemy from breaking through into our rear? All available reserves are being used. That&#x2019;s why we see mismatches of various units on small sections of the front line, leading to management problems. In my opinion, there is no point in discussing management reforms without creating reserves that would ensure the implementation of those reforms. Forming these reserves is purely a political issue that must be addressed with political decisions. This question should be directed to political leaders, not military command. Zelensky and Ukraine&apos;s parliament bear full responsibility for what is happening on the front line. These two political entities failed mobilization. To fix this, unpopular political decisions must be made, regardless of ratings and the opportunistic opposition, which will inevitably exploit this. Otherwise, we won&#x2019;t make it.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-is-failing-the-mobilization-test/	2025-01-23T01:28:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1749112458.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure 46 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least two people and injured at least 46 over the past day, including an infant, regional authorities reported on Jan. 23. Moscow&#x2019;s forces launched 92 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, as well as four Iskander-M or North Korean KN-23 ballistic missiles fired against Zaporizhzhia, according to the Air Force. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 57 drones, while 27 were lost in the airspace without inflicting damage, the Air Force said. Russia launched drones and missiles against the city of Zaporizhzhia overnight, killing a 47-year-old man and injuring at least 31 people, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. Twenty-two of the injured are hospitalized and are in a condition of medium severity. Among them is a two-month old baby, Fedorov said. The injured victims also included members of the State Emergency Service. One apartment building was destroyed and 30 were damaged in the city, in addition to damaged houses and non-residential buildings. A Russian airstrike against the city of Kostiantynivka in Donetsk Oblast killed one civilian and injured eight, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Fourteen houses, eight apartment buildings, and dozens of other buildings, infrastructure facilities, and cars were damaged. In Kherson Oblast, seven people were injured in Russian attacks, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. Twelve houses were damaged in the strikes.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-120/	2025-01-23T01:19:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/2025-01-23-11_15_22.jpg
Trump's national security adviser Waltz starts purging NSC, including aides working with Ukraine	U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz has launched a full vetting of the National Security Council (NSC) staff, including those working with Ukraine, in line with Donald Trump&apos;s America First agenda, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Jan. 23. Since returning to the White House, Trump has implemented significant changes in the new administration&apos;s staff. Trump&#x2019;s picks included candidates who have made controversial statements about Ukraine&apos;s support and ending the war. The &quot;full review&quot; aims to ensure that the NSC staff &quot;are committed to implementing President Trump&apos;s America First agenda to protect our national security and wisely use the tax dollars of America&apos;s working men and women,&quot; National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said in a statement. During a telephone call on Jan. 22, conducted by Waltz&apos;s chief of staff, Brian McCormack, NSC employees were told that they were to leave the office immediately. They were instructed that they could return only at the request of their supervisors, senior directors appointed by the Trump administration, the WP reported. According to the outlet, about 150 employees remained from the Biden administration, and the departure of such a large number of employees could complicate the administration&apos;s work during the transition period. Dozens of officials sent home on Jan. 22 had been assigned to the NSC from other government agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, the State Department, and the Pentagon. Those interested in staying with the NSC under Trump were asked to contact the human resources department and told that the new team would review those requests, according to three officials familiar with the matter. Trump has yet to present a detailed plan for peace in Ukraine, despite campaigning on promises to put a swift end to the conflict. While he frequently references his good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, his comments on Moscow in recent days have taken a somewhat harder line. When asked on Jan. 21 if he would impose additional sanctions if Putin refuses to negotiate, Trump replied: &quot;Sounds likely.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Jan. 21 Ukraine is actively working to arrange a meeting between him and Trump. &quot;We are your partner. We know all the sore spots; we have lost our people,&quot; Zelensky said, noting Trump&apos;s pledge to end the war in 2025. &quot;We want to end the war this year. But not just quickly, but fairly and, above all, reliably for us.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-national-security-adviser-waltz-starts-purging-nsc-including-those-working-with-ukraine/	2025-01-23T00:47:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2173993733.jpg
Kyiv announces release of 3 Ukrainian sailors from Houthi captivity	Editor&#x2019;s note: The story is being updated. Ukraine&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry and military intelligence agency secured the release of three Ukrainian crew members of the Galaxy Leader commercial vessel from the Houthi captivity in a &quot;joint operation,&quot; the ministry said in the statement on Jan. 23. The news comes as the Yemeni rebel group released the crew of the ship captured in November 2023 as part of attacks on vessels sailing through the Red Sea corridor. The decision is seen as part of de-escalation efforts in the wake of the Gaza ceasefire. In the statement, the Foreign Ministry did not provide further details on the release of the three Ukrainian citizens but said they are &quot;in the care of Ukrainian diplomats, are in good condition, and have all the necessary documents.&quot; The multinational crew of 25 also included sailors from Romania, Mexico, Bulgaria, and the Philippines. Ukraine has led talks on the release of its citizens since the vessel was captured, the ministry said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-secures-release-of-3-ukrainian-sailors-from-houthi-captivity/	2025-01-23T00:19:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2152897501.jpg

Depends what 'deal' means — Kremlin responds to Trump's sanctions threats	Russia will have to determine what U.S. President Donald Trump means by &quot;deal&quot; before entering into negotiations to end the full-scale war in Ukraine, Russia&apos;s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said on Jan. 22. Polyanskiy&apos;s remarks come shortly after Trump threatened to impose economic penalties on Russia if the country does not &quot;make a deal&quot; to end the war. &quot;If a deal is not reached, I will have no other choice but to put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries,&quot; he posted on his social media platform Truth Social earlier on Jan. 22. &quot;We can do it the easy way or the hard way.&quot; In response, Polyanskiy said Moscow would have to determine what Trump&apos;s aims are before it enters any agreements. &quot;It&apos;s not merely the question of ending the war,&quot; Polyanskiy told Reuters. &quot;It&apos;s first and foremost the question of addressing root causes of Ukrainian crisis. So we have to see what does the &apos;deal&apos; mean in President Trump&apos;s understanding.&quot; Trump has the opportunity to end Washington&apos;s current &quot;malicious policy&quot; against Russia, he added. Trump has yet to present a detailed plan for peace in Ukraine, despite campaigning on promises to put a swift end to the conflict. While he frequently references his good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, his comments on Moscow in recent days have taken a somewhat harder line. When asked on Jan. 21 if he would impose additional sanctions if Putin refuses to negotiate, Trump replied, &quot;Sounds likely.&quot; His team is reportedly devising a sanctions strategy to pressure Russia to the negotiating table. Russia has thus far dismissed any reported peace proposals from the Trump administration and maintained its ambitions to fully occupy four Ukrainian regions &#x2014;Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. Trump has said that arrangements for a face-to-face meeting with Putin are currently underway.	https://kyivindependent.com/depends-what-deal-means-kremlin-responds-to-trumps-sanctions-threats/	2025-01-22T21:35:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1388985966.jpg
Prigozhin’s Wagner Group accused of plotting attacks on Chevron, cooperating with Al Qaeda, leaked emails show	The late Russian warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin&apos;s Wagner mercenary force has been accused of plotting attacks against Western infrastructure in Africa, including U.S. oil company Chevron&apos;s pipelines, according to the leaked correspondence of Prigozhin&apos;s Concord Group obtained by Ukraine&apos;s 24 Channel. Another accusation is that Wagner mercenaries have allegedly cooperated with terrorists, including Al Qaeda, in Africa. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the information. The hacked correspondence contains numerous emails written by relatives of Wagner mercenaries killed in Ukraine, as well as mothers and fathers asking Prigozhin to hire their sons. The obtained emails shed light on a scandal involving food poisoning allegedly caused by the Concord Group. The group did not respond to a request for comment. Prigozhin, once a trusted confidant of Russian President Vladimir Putin, rose to infamy as the mastermind behind Wagner, Russia&apos;s most notorious mercenary force. Wagner fighters have left their mark across Africa, Syria, and Ukraine &#x2014; most notably in the grinding battles in the country&apos;s Donetsk Oblast, where they spearheaded Russia&apos;s offensive from 2022 to 2023. However, in June 2023, Prigozhin fell out with the Kremlin and led an armed rebellion, only to abruptly call it off after negotiations with Putin. Two months later, in August 2023, Prigozhin was killed in a plane crash, an incident that many independent observers have pinned on Putin as the likely orchestrator. In March 2021, Igor Smirnov wrote an email to Prigozhin&apos;s Concord Group that retired Russian officers were expected to take part in attacks on foreign infrastructure facilities in West Africa. Smirnov, allegedly a former Russian intelligence officer who allegedly worked for oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was attempting to frame or warn the group. He claimed that &quot;a group of Russians is contacting many armed groups in West Africa, including Ansaru, an Al Qaeda affiliate in Nigeria.&quot; &quot;In exchange for attacks on Western oil companies, jihadists are helping to arm militants in the Niger Delta under a direct agreement with the Russians,&quot; Smirnov said. &quot;After the first attacks on Western companies, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb will take responsibility for that.&quot; Supporters of Niger&apos;s National Council of Safeguard of the Homeland (CNSP) wave the Niger national flag (R) and flag bearing the logo of private military company Wagner, as they protest outside the Niger and French airbase to demand the departure of the French army from Niger, in Niamey on Sept. 16, 2023. (AFP via Getty Images)He also claimed that he had video and audio recordings implicating a Wagner mercenary in the negotiations about the attacks. &quot;All of this will soon come crashing down on your company, which destabilizes the situation in West Africa, cooperates with terrorists, and is waging an indirect war against the West,&quot; Smirnov added. In another email, Smirnov also accused Wagner Group of extorting money from U.S. oil company Chevron in exchange for the security of the company&apos;s pipelines in Nigeria. He claimed that the extortion had been &quot;documented by Khodorkovsky.&quot; He also attached a video that allegedly shows an associate of Wagner Group&apos;s chief of staff, Andrei Troshev, meeting with Nigerian warlord Asari Dokubo. This is not the first time Wagner mercenaries stand accused of illegal activities in Africa. Journalist Orkhan Dzhemal, film director Alexander Rastorguyev, and cameraman Kirill Radchenko were killed in the Central African Republic in 2018 while investigating the activity of Wagner mercenaries there. In 2019, Khodorkovsky&apos;s Dossier Center published an investigation according to which Wagner Group could have been behind the murder. Chevron and Khodorkovsky&apos;s press office did not respond to requests for comment. The emails obtained by the 24 Channel also reveal the consequences of Wagner Group&apos;s participation in Russia&apos;s offensives in Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk Oblast, including the Battle of Bakhmut, in 2022 and 2023. Wagner Group recruited thousands of convicts who were pardoned by Putin in exchange for military service. The convicts routinely took part in human wave attacks in Bakhmut and other areas, suffering disproportionately high casualties in the grinding offensives. Starting from January 2023, many people sent emails to Wagner asking the company about their killed relatives and compensation for their deaths. In January 2023, Ekaterina Merzlyak wrote that a 25-year-old Wagner fighter had been killed in December 2022 and later buried in the village of Krasnoselkup in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District. &quot;Fellow villagers are outraged that not a single representative of the local authorities showed due respect to the parents of our hero,&quot; she said. &quot;They did not assist with the organization of the funeral or with transportation. There was complete silence as if nothing had happened.&quot; Screenshot of Wagner mercenary group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin claiming to be on the African continent in a video published to the &quot;Razgruzka Vagnera&quot; Telegram channel linked to the mercenary group on Aug. 21, 2023. (Telegram)Merzlyak also wrote that his &quot;father had to transport the coffin himself with a trailer over a bumpy winter road for five hours, despite the fact that our administration finds it easy to bring in some singer by helicopter for City Day celebrations.&quot; The correspondence also contains emails written by prison inmates&apos; mothers asking Wagner to recruit their sons. &quot;Dear Yevgeny Viktorovich (Prigozhin), I am asking for your help! Please help my son redeem himself,&quot; one of them wrote to Prigozhin in November 2022. &quot;My son went to Moscow to earn a living. Unfortunately, he got into trouble there and ended up in pretrial detention.&quot; She wrote Prigozizhin &quot;to help my son get to the front,&quot; saying that &quot;he is very eager for your help!&quot; A man named Andrei Lapshin wrote in April 2023 that his 15-year old son, a cadet at a military school, is &quot;deeply engaged in the patriotic agenda, sees his future in the ranks of Russian law enforcement agencies and is an avid fan of Wagner Group.&quot; &quot;Therefore, I would like to ask for your help in possibly arranging a job for him during the summer break &#x2014; so that he doesn&apos;t waste his time working at some chain caf&#xE9; or as a courier, but rather gets involved in a real, serious, necessary, and useful task for our Motherland,&quot; Lapshin added. Some other emails were more critical of Wagner Group&apos;s activities. A woman named Dinara Satanova wrote in July 2023 that the hands of Wagner Group&apos;s leadership were &quot;stained with the blood of our children, husbands, and brothers.&quot; &quot;We are aware of the facts of killings, abuse, denial of medical assistance, and starvation, despite all efforts to conceal them,&quot; she said. Satanova said that Wagner&apos;s drive to recruit convicts was &quot;like slave trade from which the company made millions.&quot; &quot;You have destroyed and ruined our families, our children,&quot; she said. &quot;On what grounds were children under the age of 22 recruited? Mothers were not informed, and no consent was given.&quot; Apart from military activities, the correspondence covers Concord Group&apos;s food procurement schemes. In 2019, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny&apos;s team exposed Concord Group&apos;s low-quality food deliveries to schools and kindergartens in Moscow and St. Petersburg, which resulted in the poisoning of hundreds of children. Amid the scandal, many parents sent emails to Concord Group and demanded compensation. In response to the accusations, in August 2019, Prigozhin accused Navalny and his associate Lyubov Sobol of orchestrating the poisoning, according to the leaked correspondence. He claimed that Navalny and Sobol &quot;extorted 300 million rubles ($3 million) to avoid stirring up a scandal regarding the children.&quot; A portrait of late head of Wagner paramilitary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, displayed at a makeshift memorial in Moscow, Russia, on Aug. 27, 2023. (Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP via Getty Images)&quot;We have made significant progress in this investigation and do not rule out the possibility that the poisoning incident was the result of a blatant act of sabotage, as numerous facts suggest,&quot; Prigozhin said. &quot;As you know, Sobol is a person willing to commit any crime to become a politician... We have witnesses who confirm that Sobol was directly involved in the children&apos;s illness.&quot; He claimed that Sobol and Navalny &quot;could have been the masterminds and organizers of this terrible crime.&quot; Despite Prigozhin&apos;s claims, even a Russian court recognized in 2019 that Concord Group was to blame for the food poisoning and ordered it to pay compensation. Navalny himself survived a poisoning attempt in 2020. A joint investigation by The Insider, Bellingcat, CNN, and Der Spiegel revealed that Navalny had been poisoned with the Novichok nerve agent by agents of Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service. In February 2024, Navalny died in a Russian prison. Independent experts say that he was either killed intentionally or died due to harsh conditions and lack of medical treatment. Navalny&apos;s team did not respond to a request for comment.	https://kyivindependent.com/prigozhins-wagner-group-accused-of-plotting-attacks-on-chevron-cooperating-with-al-qaeda-leaked-emails-show/	2025-01-22T21:00:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1259010459.jpg
Russian attack in Zaporizhzhia injures at least 16	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia attacked the city of Zaporizhzhia in the early hours of Jan. 23, damaging a residential building and injuring at least 16 people, Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. The attack left at least 16 people wounded, Fedorov said. Four of the injured victims are employees of Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service. They are reportedly being treated at the hospital. Rescue operations are ongoing at the site as emergency workers search for victims who may be trapped beneath the rubble. According to Fedorov, at least four explosions occurred in Zaporizhzhia shortly after 4 a.m. local time. An aerial alert was issued over the region due to the threat of Russian ballistic missiles. The attack damaged residential buildings in the city, damaging a roof and smashing multiple windows, Fedorov said. Zaporizhzhia, home to approximately 710,000 residents before Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, is frequently targeted by Russian forces. An attack against an industrial facility in the city on Jan. 8 killed 13 people and injured 122, including a child.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-in-zaporizhzhia-injures-at-least-16/	2025-01-22T19:24:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/zapo.jpg
Zelensky meets with Serbian, Argentine presidents at Davos forum	President Volodymyr Zelensky held separate meetings with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Argentine President Javier Milei on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan. 22. Zelensky is leading a Ukrainian delegation at the forum, which takes place Jan. 20-24. His agenda includes bilateral talks with world leaders and meetings with top business officials. The meeting with Vucic centered on security guarantees and the two countries&apos; path to membership in the European Union, the Presidential Office said. Vucic has previously called Ukraine a &quot;friendly country&quot; and affirmed that Crimea and Donbas are sovereign Ukrainian territories, despite Serbia&apos;s historically warm relationship with Russia. During the meeting, Zelensky stressed to Vucic that &quot;sustainable peace must be supported by strong security guarantees.&quot; The leaders&apos; meeting comes a week after Vucic offered to host a potential meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Belgrade. Zelensky&apos;s meeting with Milei touched on matters of economic cooperation, recent global events, and cooperation with the U.S. following Trump&apos;s inauguration. Zelensky also issued a warm invitation for Milei to visit Ukraine. &quot;You are a much-awaited guest in Ukraine,&quot; the president said. &quot;I invite you to get to know the Ukrainian people, they love you very much. I want you to see with your own eyes how Ukrainians are fighting and what they are going through during this war. And I really want Ukrainians to feel how much you respect them.&quot; The leaders agreed to maintain high-level contacts between Ukraine and Argentina and discussed possibilities for developing trade and expanding economic cooperation. Milei has repeatedly expressed firm support for Ukrainian sovereignty in the face of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Zelensky visited Argentina in December 2023 to attend Milei&apos;s inauguration, and the two leaders held talks in Buenos Aires. Argentina in 2024 joined the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which meets regularly at the Ramstein Airbase in Germany to coordinate military aid for Ukraine, and international coalition for the return of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia. One of Zelensky&apos;s stated aims heading into the Davos forum was to meet with leaders from Latin America. Earlier in the day, Zelensky met with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz and Israeli President Isaac Herzog.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-with-serbian-argentine-presidents-at-davos-forum/	2025-01-22T19:06:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/davos.jpeg
SBU conducts 150 special operations in 3 days in large-scale security crackdown	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) conducted 157 special operations from Jan. 18-20, the agency said on Jan. 22. The SBU issued the announcement after reporting a wave of investigations, arrests, and charges in recent days. Suspects were accused of various crimes, including aiding Russia&apos;s war effort. The agency carried out 157 special operations from Jan. 18-20 in order to &quot;counter crimes that pose a threat to state security, territorial integrity and defense capabilities of our country,&quot; the SBU said. The actions resulted in 222 charges and 85 detentions, the agency said. The SBU also carried out 287 searches during the operations. According to the SBU, the three-day crackdown targeted 19 agents suspected to have carried out intelligence and sabotage activities on behalf of Russian special services. It also netted 24 individuals who allegedly harmed &quot;the economic interests&quot; of Ukraine. The SBU charged 63 people with participating in draft evasion schemes and 39 individuals with crimes related to the military, including embezzling from the state defense budget. Another seven were charged with illegal weapons trafficking, and seven others allegedly spread propaganda or otherwise posed threats to Ukraine&apos;s cybersecurity, the agency reported. President Volodymyr Zelensky on Jan. 18, the first day of the recent crackdown, praised Ukrainian law enforcement agencies for their investigations. &quot;Traitors and various schemes that weakened our state and our Ukrainian society are being countered,&quot; the president said. &quot;And anyone who stands against Ukraine or defies the laws of Ukraine must remember, that they will face a response.&quot; The SBU has announced high-profile arrests in recent days, including the detention of a well-known Dnipro lawyer who allegedly helped Russia carry out missile strikes and that of Ukraine&apos;s chief military psychaitrist, who is suspected of illicit enrichment activities. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-conducts-150-special-operations-in-3-days-in-large-scale-security-crackdown/	2025-01-22T18:00:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/SBU-badge.jpg
Russia could challenge EU's defense readiness within 5 years, Kallas says	European Union leaders are warning that Russia could test the bloc&apos;s readiness to defend itself within the next three to five years, calling for an increase in defense budgets and deepen military cooperation among member states. Speaking at a European Defense Agency meeting on Jan. 22, EU&apos;s chief diplomat Kaja Kallas stressed that the bloc must act decisively to counter Russia&apos;s growing militarization, with President Vladimir Putin allocating over one-third of his national budget to military spending &#x2014; three times what it was before the invasion of Ukraine. &quot;This is a heavily militarized country that presents an existential threat to us all,&quot; Kallas warned, citing intelligence reports suggesting that Russia is preparing for further provocations. &quot;We are running out of time. The Ukrainians are fighting for their freedom and ours. They are buying us time.&quot; German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius echoes Kallas&apos; concerns. Speaking with journalists in Lithuania, he has cautioned that Russia could be capable of attacking NATO territory within the next five to six years due to its rapid military industrialization. &quot;By 2029 or 2030, Putin could strengthen his army to the point where Russia would be capable of striking NATO,&quot; Pistorius said, according to Delfi. The minister also highlighted that Russia now produces more weapons and ammunition in months than the entire EU manufactures in a year. The EU has already committed over 130 billion euros in support to Ukraine, including nearly 50 billion euros in military aid. Member states have also trained 75,000 Ukrainian soldiers and imposed extensive sanctions on Russia. However, Kallas is adamant that more needs to be done. &quot;Russia is spending 9% of its GDP on defense, while EU member states collectively average only 1.9%. This sends a dangerous signal to the aggressor. Weakness invites them in,&quot; EU&apos;s top diplomat noted. To address these challenges, the EU is drafting a Preparedness Strategy that emphasizes stronger defense integration without forming a single European army. Instead, the plan focuses on enabling 27 capable national armies to work cohesively. &quot;We need investment from member states, the private sector, and the common EU budget. We must relay a message that we are serious about our commitment to European defense,&quot; Kallas said, highlighting the urgency of increasing production capabilities for weapons and military equipment. &quot;Ukraine is Europe&#x2019;s front line for defense,&quot; Kallas said, adding that Russia&#x2019;s military aggression has already been accompanied by hybrid warfare tactics, including cyberattacks, election interference, and sabotage across Europe. &quot;We need more, faster, and stronger support for Ukraine because the only language the Kremlin understands is the language of strength.&quot; While Russia&#x2019;s limited territorial gains in Ukraine have come at a high cost to its military and economy, EU leaders must remain cautious. &quot;Russia is not invincible, but neither is time on our side. We must prepare for the worst while striving for peace through strength.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-could-test-eus-readiness-to-defend-itself-in-3-to-5-years-time-kallas-says/	2025-01-22T15:50:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1401349176.jpg
US leadership essential in Ukraine peace efforts, Zelensky tells Bloomberg	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 22 that any effective peacekeeping force in Ukraine must include U.S. troops, emphasizing the critical role of the United States in deterring Russian aggression. Speaking with Bloomberg&apos;s Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Zelensky dismissed the idea that European allies could provide sufficient military support independently. &quot;It can&#x2019;t be without the United States,&quot; he said. &quot;Even if some European friends think it can be, no it can&#x2019;t be. Nobody will risk without the United States.&quot; As Donald Trump assumes office with plans to engage directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Zelensky seeks to secure long-term U.S. support while urging China to leverage its influence on Russia. Frustrated by limited communication with Chinese President Xi Jinping, he said: &quot;He can push Putin for peace, I&#x2019;m sure. President Trump is the strongest &#x2014; and Xi Jinping. I think there&#x2019;s no other ally who can really do it. His economy, Putin, depends very much on China.&quot; Zelensky stressed the importance of Ukraine&#x2019;s involvement in any negotiations about its future, warning against deals made without Kyiv&#x2019;s input, as he believes happened during the Minsk talks in 2015. &quot;We do not want this to happen behind the backs of Ukraine,&quot; he said. &quot;I very much believe that the U.S. won&#x2019;t do that, although I&#x2019;m not sure that earlier this did not happen. Here I&#x2019;m speaking not just about America, but some European partners.&quot; With Trump pledging a swift end to the war and planning talks with Putin, Zelensky is working to frame the negotiations as an opportunity for the U.S. to demonstrate strength. &quot;Ending the war should be a victory for Trump, not for Putin,&quot; he told Bloomberg, adding that without strong and irreversible security guarantees from the U.S. and Europe, a ceasefire could allow Russia to rearm and renew its offensive. &quot;The only question is what security guarantees and honestly I want to have understanding before the talks,&quot; he said. Zelensky has also faced challenges regarding domestic mobilization efforts, resisting pressure to expand conscription in Ukraine. Western allies, including the U.S., have urged lowering the age of conscription to bolster manpower. However, Zelensky argued that the focus should be on supplying weapons rather than drafting more soldiers. &quot;Why mobilize even younger people,&quot; he said. &quot;So that there are even more people without weapons?&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-tells-bloomberg-us-leadership-essential-in-ukraine-peace-efforts/	2025-01-22T14:46:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194672448.jpg
EU to allocate $36 billion of financial support to Ukraine	The European Union will provide 35 billion euros ($36 billion) in financial assistance to Ukraine in 2025 through the G7 ERA credit initiative and the Ukraine Facility program, European Commission&apos;s vice-president and trade commissioner announced on Jan. 22.

The money has been provided through the Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) initiative, in which G7 countries pledged to provide Ukraine with almost $50 billion loan, with the EU contributing around $20 billion. In December 2024, the U.S. Treasury Department announced a $20 billion loan to Ukraine as part of the ERA initiative, backed by the proceeds from approximately $300 billion in frozen Russian assets, primarily held in European countries, with smaller amounts in the United States and Japan.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-to-allocate-36-billion-of-financial-support-to-ukraine/	2025-01-22T13:25:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2151615401.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine's Special Forces say they killed 21 North Korean soldiers, show combat footage	Key developments on Jan. 22: Warning: Footage includes violent and graphic content. Soldiers of the 8th Regiment of Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces resisted a North Korean assault in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast for eight hours before retreating, killing 21 and wounding 40 soldiers, the unit said on Jan. 22. The statement comes as Russia ramps up efforts to push out Ukrainian troops entrenched in the western Russian region, deploying its North Korean allies in ground assaults. In a video shared by the Special Operations Forces, a large assault group of purportedly North Korean soldiers is seen crossing an open field and forest, followed by close combat footage with only dozens of meters between the two sides. In the end, graphic footage shows killed soldiers claimed to be North Koreans. &quot;At the ninth hour of the battle, the Special Operations Forces had only a third of their ammunition left. They spent the rest on destroying (North Korean forces),&quot; the Telegram post read. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage shared by Ukraine&apos;s Special Operation Forces that purports to show an engagement with North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Video released on Jan. 22, 2025. Contains graphic and violent content. (Special Operations Forces).The Ukrainian fighters held off the assault with small arms, grenade launchers, and snipers. Eventually, the Ukrainian troops retreated in two Humvees, the post read. North Korea deployed around 12,000 soldiers in Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion in August 2024 to bring the war to Russian territory. North Koren troops have suffered 4,000 casualties, both wounded and killed, President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed earlier in January 2025. In exchange for the troop transfer, Russia is paying over $2,000 for each North Korean soldier, though officials said it is unclear how much is allocated to individual soldiers and the Pyongyang government. A Kyiv court arrested General Yurii Halushkin, General Artur Horbenko, and Colonel Illia Lapin, three officers accused of leading an unsuccessful defense in Kharkiv Oblast during a Russian offensive last spring, Suspilne reported on Jan. 21. Russia launched a cross-border offensive into northeastern Kharkiv Oblast in May 2024, swiftly moving forward by several kilometers despite Ukraine&apos;s efforts to fortify border regions. Though the Russian offensive eventually stalled some 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Kharkiv, its initial success sparked outrage against regional and military leaders for poor defense planning. The three officers responsible for organizing the defenses were detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on Jan. 20. They were accused of violating military regulations and not using all resources at their disposal to repel the Russian offensive. &quot;This led to the seizure of part of the territory in the eastern Ukrainian region, where fierce fighting is currently ongoing,&quot; the SBU said. Halushkin commanded the Kharkiv Operational-Tactical Group, Horbenko led the 125th Territorial Defense Brigade that was deployed in the area, and Lapin commanded the brigade&apos;s 415th Battalion. The three suspects were charged with negligence in military service and &#x2014; in Horbenko&apos;s and Lapin&apos;s cases &#x2014; carrying out unauthorized withdrawal from the battlefield. They face up to 10 years in prison. &quot;The charged officials did not ensure the fortification and engineering arrangements of defensive positions (in Kharkiv Oblast). They did not ensure proper organization of units during the battle,&quot; the State Bureau of Investigation said. The suspects&apos; lawyers protested the charges. The trial comes against the backdrop of several scandals connected to poor command and organization in different brigades. Military mismanagement has often been cited as one of the key challenges plaguing Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces as it faces the Russian advance in the east. Russia lacks sufficient forces for a big breakthrough in Ukraine, NATO&apos;s Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, General Christopher Cavoli, said during a discussion on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan. 21. &quot;I&apos;m not worried that Ukraine could suddenly lose. I don&apos;t see the potential for a massive (Russian) breakthrough,&quot; Cavoli said. &quot;And this is not a political but a military vision. It&apos;s got to do with both sides, the effective defenses that the Ukrainians have been putting in, but also the difficulty that the Russian side has in generating significant offensive forces to be able to exploit a potential breakthrough.&quot; Russia quickly advanced in Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk Oblast in late 2024, making operationally significant gains near Toretsk, Chasiv Yar, and Kupiansk, as well as on its own soil in Kursk Oblast. Ukraine has struggled to contain the Russian offensive as Ukrainian forces are overstretched and dealing with manpower shortages. Despite Russian advances, Cavoli said Russia&apos;s slow and incremental push is &quot;exhausting&quot; for Moscow&apos;s forces. &quot;After all, there is a reason why Russia brought thousands and thousands of soldiers from North Korea,&quot; he added, referring to the 12,000-strong North Korean contingent dispatched to Kursk Oblast. &quot;I think we&apos;re going to continue to see this tension between the desire to attack and the lack of manpower on the part of the Russians. I think that will largely define the conflict and force the Russians to use more weapons of deterrence, as we&apos;ve seen them do in recent years.&quot; The general also said that though it remains unclear whether the U.S. will continue providing military aid packages under the Trump administration, he pointed to the &quot;very significant uplift in European aid&quot; provided to Ukraine. Recently inaugurated U.S. President Donald Trump criticized military aid for Ukraine during his campaign and, after his reelection, hinted at reducing it. Multiple media reports have nevertheless indicated that Trump does not intend to cut aid completely but wants to see Europe take up greater responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security. Russia wanted to install pro-Kremlin oligarch Viktor Medvedchuk as Ukraine&apos;s president after forcing President Volodymyr Zelensky to step down, the Ukrainian head of state said on Jan. 22, citing a Kremlin ultimatum he received in the early days of the full-scale war. &quot;Some people came to me on the first days of the war, some people from Ukraine&#x2026;They gave me the ultimatum from (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,&quot; Zelensky said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. &quot;They said that I have to go, and they will change me (for) Medvedchuk (as president).&quot; According to Zelensky, the ultimatum also demanded Ukraine recognize Russian occupation authorities in Donbas, change its constitution to commit to &quot;neutrality,&quot; shrink its army to 50,000 troops, give up much of its weapon arsenal, and recognize Russian as an official language of Ukraine. &quot;This was not a negotiation; it&#x2019;s an ultimatum,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that Russia&#x2019;s points were similar to those later presented during unsuccessful peace talks in 2022 that took place in Turkey. Formerly a Ukrainian lawmaker and businessman, Medvedchuk was among the leading pro-Russian figures in Ukraine before the full-scale invasion. He maintained close personal relations with Putin, who is the godfather of the oligarch&apos;s daughter. Medvedchuk was detained by Ukrainian authorities in 2022 and exchanged with Russia later the same year. Possible peace talks are again coming into focus as U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table. Zelensky said earlier during the forum that his country will seek to achieve a quick but just peace this year. The U.S. and European countries remained in contact with Russia throughout the full-scale war, namely on the level of intelligence agencies, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 22. &quot;The U.S. and Russia maintained contacts on various levels during the three years of the war&#x2026; and Europeans too,&quot; Zelensky said in a meeting with international journalists. Zelensky noted that &quot;diplomacy has to have an isolationist quality, just like sanctions. If the leaders don&apos;t talk, but the intelligence agencies are constantly in touch, then, in principle, this may suit Russia.&quot; The Western countries have largely cut official contacts with Russia following the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022. The international isolation imposed on the Kremlin appears to be weakening as U.S. President Donald Trump announced his intention to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss a potential peace deal. Commenting on the news that Trump plans to arrange a phone call with Putin, Zelensky said he is not surprised by Washington&apos;s efforts to establish contact with the Kremlin but believes Ukraine &quot;should be the priority because we are the allies of the U.S.&quot; Trump&apos;s new secretary of state, Marco Rubio, recently confirmed in an interview that the Trump administration will aim for a sustainable peace deal so that the war with Russia does not begin anew in two to four years. Trump said earlier if Putin does not come to the negotiating table, Moscow may face fresh economic sanctions. The Trump administration is working to attain a sustainable peace in Ukraine so that the war with Russia does not begin anew in two to four years, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Jan. 21. &quot;We are going to engage in making it (the war) end in a way that is sustainable, meaning we don&apos;t just want the conflict to end and then restart in two, three, or four years down the road,&quot; the recently confirmed top U.S. diplomat said on the CBS Mornings program. &quot;We want to bring stability.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump, who took office on Jan. 20, vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table and end the full-scale war nearing its third-year anniversary. He has revealed few details on how he plans to achieve that goal, though Rubio repeatedly said that both Ukraine and Russia will have to make concessions. &quot;It is a stalemate. It&apos;s a war that was started by Russia, but it is now a stalemate, a protracted bloody conflict,&quot; Rubio said on CBS Mornings, adding that the war has been &quot;incredibly destructive&quot; for both Ukraine and Russia. The secretary of state nevertheless said that Ukraine &quot;is paying the biggest price of all to its energy infrastructure, to the people, the lives that are lost, to the millions of Ukrainians that have had to leave their countries and are living overseas.&quot; Ukraine has struggled to contain the Russian advance as the battlefield began tilting in Moscow&apos;s favor in late 2024. Facing increasingly difficult manpower shortages, the Ukrainian military was forced to steadily cede ground to Russian forces in eastern Donetsk Oblast. In turn, Russia is believed to have lost between 700,000-800,000 soldiers killed and wounded, though it demonstrated the capability to replace the losses with new contract soldiers. The country&apos;s economy also faces economic headwinds amid soaring inflation and tightening sanctions against its energy sector. In a rare criticism, Trump said on Jan. 20 that Russian President Vladimir Putin is &quot;destroying Russia&quot; by not seeking a deal to end the war. The new U.S. president said he plans to soon meet his Russian counterpart, though he admitted uncertainty about whether the Kremlin&apos;s chief seeks a negotiated settlement. Since his electoral campaign in 2024, Trump has repeatedly claimed that the full-scale invasion would not have started if he had been in office at the time and pledged to broker an end within 24 hours. He and his team have since shifted rhetoric and acknowledged complexities in resolving the war. When asked about the expired 24-hour deadline, Rubio evaded commenting on any possible timeframe and merely said that ending the war would be the &quot;priority&quot; and &quot;policy of the United States.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump called on Russia to &quot;make a deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine on Jan. 22, warning that failure to reach an agreement would lead to increased sanctions, tariffs, and taxes on Russian goods. &quot;If a deal is not reached, I will have no other choice but to put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries,&quot; he posted on his social media platform Truth Social. &quot;We can do it the easy way or the hard way,&quot; said in reference to negotiating an end to the war, adding, &quot;the easy way is always better.&quot; While stressing that he is &quot;not looking to hurt Russia&quot; and maintaining that he has &quot;always had a very good relationship&quot; with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump added, &quot;It&apos;s time to &apos;Make a deal. No more lives should be lost.&quot; The statement comes as the Trump administration reportedly works on a sanctions strategy to advance a diplomatic solution to the conflict, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 16. Two primary approaches are under consideration. The first involves offering targeted relief to sanctioned Russian oil producers as an incentive if peace negotiations advance. The second calls for significantly expanding sanctions to increase pressure on Moscow, according to Bloomberg. His comments align with his previous vows to swiftly negotiate the war&apos;s end, though he has yet to present a detailed plan. When asked on Jan. 21 if he would impose additional sanctions if Putin fails to negotiate, Trump replied, &quot;Sounds likely.&quot; The Biden administration and the U.K. recently imposed their most extensive sanctions, targeting nearly 200 vessels in Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; key oil companies, and related entities, further tightening the economic noose around Moscow. Trump&apos;s efforts reportedly include plans to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and consultations with Putin.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-53/	2025-01-22T12:06:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/North-Korean-troops.png
Scandal-hit 155th Ukrainian Brigade commander in custody with $2.1 million bail, media reports	The former commander of the scandal-hit Ukrainian 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Brigade has been remanded in custody with a bail of Hr 90 million ($2.1 million), Hromadske reported on Jan. 22. The court&apos;s decision comes amid an investigation into allegations of poor leadership and widespread issues within the unit, which was deployed near Pokrovsk. The brigade, initially intended as a flagship project for Ukrainian military modernization, was trained and equipped with assistance from France and other foreign partners. French President Emmanuel Macron announced in June that France would provide training and military supplies, including AMX-10 armored vehicles, Caesar howitzers, and German Leopard 2A4 tanks. An investigation by Yurii Butusov, editor-in-chief of Censor.net, uncovered significant issues within the brigade. Butusov reported high numbers of soldiers going absent without official leave (AWOL) due to disorganization and poor leadership. The State Bureau of Investigation said on Jan. 20 that the brigade commander &quot;did not respond to violations in his unit, including the unauthorized abandonment of the military unit by his fighters.&quot; If convicted, the commander faces up to 10 years in prison. The brigade, which has approximately 5,800 troops, faced challenges from its inception. According to Butusov, 2,500 service members were reassigned to other units before training began, depleting its experienced personnel. Between March and November 2024, over 1,700 soldiers reportedly abandoned their posts, with an additional 50 deserting while training in France. Of the 1,924 soldiers sent to France for training, only 51 had more than a year of military service, while 1,414 had served fewer than two months. Replenishment efforts brought in new recruits, but Butusov claimed proper selection processes were often neglected, exacerbating the unit&apos;s operational challenges.	https://kyivindependent.com/commander-of-scandal-hit-155th-ukrainian-brigade-detained-with-2-1-million-bail-media-reports/	2025-01-22T11:51:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-20-at-15_59_41.png
Ukraine's OnlyFans content creators declare more than $7 million in income	Ukraine&apos;s tax service is looking to collect taxes on Ukrainians&apos; income made on the the subscription-based site OnlyFans, widely known for being an adult content platform, despite pornography being illegal in the country. After the country&apos;s tax service sent out requests to Ukrainian citizens who earn money on the platform, 451 people sent in declarations totaling Hr 326.1 million ($7.76 million) for the period of 2020-2022, Ekonomichna Pravda reported on Jan. 22, citing information requested from the country&apos;s tax service. Ukraine&apos;s tax authorities said it had requested data from the U.K.&apos;s tax service on Ukrainian earnings on OnlyFans for the period from 2020-2022, Ekonomichna Pravda reported. OnlyFans is owned by the British company Fenix &#x200B;&#x200B;International Limited. Ukraine&apos;s tax service refused to disclose how many Ukrainian citizens were earning money on OnlyFans, but said it had sent out 4,429 requests to Ukrainians to declare their income from the site. Only 451 people, or 10% of those contacted, filed declarations. These filings revealed a total tax liability of Hr 63.2 million ($1.5 million) in personal income and military taxes. It is unclear what type of content those who responded to the request for declaration are creating on OnlyFans. Although OnlyFans is known for adult content, it hosts a variety of materials, including fitness tutorials, cooking lessons, and behind-the-scenes content from artists. Ukraine&apos;s tax service also told Ekonomichna Pravda that it had received a court order to pass along information on Ukrainians earning money on the site to a law enforcement agency, without specifying which one. The media outlet reported a day earlier that Ukraine&apos;s Bureau of Economic Security was provided the names of Ukrainians earning income on the platform, and had begun carrying out searches of models and bringing charges against them under Article 301 of the criminal code that deals with the production of pornography. Kyiv has looked to increasing tax revenues as a means to bolster its wartime budget amid Russia&apos;s ongoing war. But as pornography and adult content, which makes up a lot of the activity on OnlyFans, remains illegal in Ukraine, its users have largely avoided declaring income from the site out of fear of legal repercussions. Ukraine&apos;s strict anti-pornography laws have created complications for creators. The legal framework prohibits the production and distribution of pornography, with broad interpretations leading to prosecutions even for consensual sharing of intimate images. &quot;OnlyFans already pays taxes in Ukraine. But for &apos;Ukrainian actors,&apos; even if they want to pay taxes, it is impossible. It would be an admission of guilt,&quot; Opposition lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said late last year. OnlyFans as a company pays taxes in Ukraine through the country&apos;s taxes on electronic services. Efforts to change the laws surrounding pornography are underway. A bill to decriminalize pornography was registered in late 2024 for the second time in recent years and gained support from the Verkhovna Rada&apos;s specialized law enforcement committee in December. Zhelezniak, who has supported amending the laws around pornography in Ukraine, said late last year that there are more than 5,000 people in the country currently making money through OnlyFans.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-on-onlyfans-declared-7-76-million-amid-legal-ambiguities-media-reports/	2025-01-22T11:39:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/Website---Porn-5.png
Ukraine's energy giant DTEK to invest $468 million in expanding Black Sea wind power plant	Ukraine&apos;s largest private energy company, DTEK, announced plans on Jan. 22 to invest 450 million euros ($468 million) in expanding the Tyligulska Wind Power Plant near the Black Sea coast. DTEK, which is owned by Ukraine&apos;s richest man Rinat Akhmetov, lost nearly 90% of its generation capacity in 2024 due to Russia&apos;s aerial attacks targeting Ukraine&apos;s power grid. The company said it reached a financing deal with lenders to purchase 64 wind turbines from Danish manufacturer Vestas, a world leader in turbine production. By expanding the facility from 19 to 83 turbines, the project aims to increase the wind farm&apos;s capacity fourfold, from 114 megawatts (MW) to 500 MW, DTEK said. The project is expected to be completed by late 2026 and generate 1.7 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity annually, enough to power 900,000 Ukrainian homes. Of the 450-million-euro investment, 370 million euros ($385 million) will be financed through bank loans guaranteed by Denmark&apos;s state-owned Export and Investment Fund (EIFO), with the remainder funded by DTEK. &quot;The commitment is the largest private sector investment in Ukraine since russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022 and the biggest ever private investment in Ukraine&#x2019;s energy sector,&quot; the company said in a press release. The Tyligulska plant, which became operational in May 2023, is located in Mykolaiv Oblast, approximately 400 kilometers south of Kyiv, and consists of 19 Danish company Vestas-supplied wind turbines. DTEK signed a memorandum of understanding with Vestas in December 2023, aiming to construct the largest wind farm in Eastern Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-energy-giant-to-invest-468-million-in-expanding-black-sea-wind-power-plant/	2025-01-22T10:51:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/_19R5572.jpeg
How Ukraine lost faith in the Red Cross and UN	Seeing the face of Ukrainian soldier Maksym Kolesnykov light up with joy over an apple upon his release from Russian captivity last February was enough to bring anyone to tears. During nearly a year in captivity, Kolesnykov lost over 30 kilograms and could not walk freely due to a severe injury in his left leg. Yet the only international organization he should have been able to rely on was never there for him. &quot;Not once did I see a representative of the Red Cross,&quot; Kolesnykov, now 47, told the Kyiv Independent. Like Kolesnykov, most Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) have never been visited by the representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) while in Russian captivity, says Ukraine&apos;s Human Rights Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets. Upon their release, numerous Ukrainian POWs revealed the horrific conditions they had endured in Russian prisons, facing near starvation, torture, and humiliation.

(Kostiantyn Liberov / Libkos / Getty Images)Ukraine&#x2019;s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of POWs said in October that &#xA0;177 Ukrainian soldiers have &quot;died from torture and inhumane treatment&quot; while in captivity. But international organizations &quot;turn a blind eye,&quot; says Lubinets. Kolesnykov recalls conditions in the Russian prison improving only slightly during an internal inspection by the Russian Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office. He believes that if the ICRC had been present, it might have prompted the prison staff to treat POWs better. &quot;I think their (the ICRC) appearance could have changed something for us. Maybe some conventions would have been followed, or the (prisoners&apos;) physical state would have been documented,&quot; says Kolesnykov. &quot;Any oversight in such a criminal situation would be good.&quot; With the start of the Russian full-scale war, Ukraine seems to have lost faith in major international bodies like the ICRC and the United Nations (U.N.) Once seen as pillars of global humanitarian aid, both organizations have been widely criticized by Kyiv for not doing enough, effectively undermining their authority and the very concept of international institutions as a cornerstone of the West. The relationship between Ukrainian officials and civic society, and international organizations has deteriorated since the start of the full-scale war. Myroslava Kharchenko, a lawyer with the NGO Save Ukraine, recalls asking the Ukrainian branch of the ICRC for a vehicle to evacuate children from Russian-occupied Kyiv Oblast early in the war, hoping its emblem would deter Russian attacks. According to Kharchenko, the ICRC refused, citing mandate limitations and also declined to provide body armor for volunteers. &quot;We didn&apos;t ask them to go there personally, to risk their lives; we were going to do it ourselves, but they refused,&quot; Kharchenko says. President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized the ICRC for similar cases at the time, saying that it &quot;says a lot&quot; about the organization. As the war went on, the criticism escalated: Ukraine denounced both the U.N. and the ICRC for insufficient or delayed humanitarian responses, including when Russian troops blew up the Kakhovka Dam in June 2023, resulting in a major flood in the south of Ukraine. &quot;They are not there,&quot; Zelensky told the Bild media outlet at the time. Just a few hours after Russian forces destroyed the dam in Kherson Oblast, causing a humanitarian and ecological disaster, the U.N. posted on X to mark its annual Russian Language Day. &#xA0; &quot;Russian commanders will have given the order to blow up the Kakhovka Dam in Russian (language). What a day at the U.N. to celebrate the Russian Language!&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry said in response. Russian commanders will have given the order to blow up the Kakhovka Dam in Russian. What a day at the UN to celebrate Russian language! @UnitedNationsRU tweets about cultural diversity, ignoring the biggest catastrophe in Europe in decades caused solely by Russia. Why be silent? https://t.co/8z5PIyfs8P That has once again prompted a discussion in Ukrainian society about whether Russia&apos;s place in various U.N. bodies and the U.N.&apos;s lenient attitude toward Russia should be reconsidered. Zelensky has called for the U.N. Security Council to strip Russia of its veto power multiple times: &quot;All the U.N. actions &#x2014; either by the Security Council or the General Assembly &#x2014; that could have stopped this aggression are shattered by the privilege granted by this seat to the aggressor.&quot; &quot;Veto power in the hands of the aggressor is what has pushed the U.N. into a dead end,&quot; Zelensky said at the U.N. Security Council on Sept. 20, 2023. Last fall, the heads of both the ICRC and the U.N. faced backlash in Ukraine again. In September, ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric met with the Russian Presidential Commissioner for Children&apos;s Rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, who, alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin, is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for their involvement in the forced deportation of thousands of Ukrainian children. In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin meets with Russia&apos;s presidential commissioner for children&apos;s rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, in Moscow, Russia on May 31, 2024. (Alexander Kazakov / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)In her social media post, Lvova-Belova even thanked the ICRC for its support in &quot;reuniting the families&quot; since the start of the full-scale war. According to the Ukrainian national database, Russia has deported over 19,500 Ukrainian children from occupied territories since Feb. 24, 2022. Although it&apos;s not part of the ICRC&apos;s mandate to &quot;counter&quot; the deportation of children, supporting it is &quot;the height of cynicism,&quot; Kharchenko says. On Oct. 24 &#x2014; United Nations Day which marks the anniversary of the day in 1945 when the U.N. Charter entered into force &#x2014; the U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres took part in the BRICS summit in the Russian city of Kazan, despite facing sharp criticism. Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) greets UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres (L) during their bilateral meeting at the BRICS Leaders&apos; Summit in Kazan, Tatarstan Republic, Russia, on Oct. 24, 2024. (Contributor / Getty Images)He also met Putin there, with a photograph of their handshake blasted by Ukrainians, as well as several Western officials on social media. Before that, Guterres had declined Ukraine&apos;s invitation to the first global peace summit in Switzerland, held last summer. In response, Zelensky also reportedly rejected Guterres&apos; visit to Ukraine. &quot;Although even some of its functionaries prefer the temptations in Kazan to the content of the U.N. Charter, our world is built in such a way that the rights of nations and the norms of international law matter and will matter,&quot; Zelensky said on Oct. 24, alluding to Guterres&apos; actions. The treatment of Ukrainian POWs in Russian captivity remains one of the most pressing issues for Ukrainian society. Multiple reports have revealed torture, inhumane conditions, and executions of POWs in captivity, while Ukraine also indicates minimal access to its POWs by the ICRC. Petro Yatsenko, a representative of the Ukrainian Coordination Center for the Treatment of POWs, says there are &quot;many things that the ICRC is currently unable to monitor within Russia.&quot; While the ICRC claims to have paid over 3,000 visits to POWs on both sides, it never specifies how many of them were to see Ukrainian POWs in Russia, Yatsenko says, adding the number is &quot;extremely low.&quot; &quot;This is a form of manipulation directed at both Ukrainian and international society,&quot; he says. &quot;We demand the ICRC recognize that they can not effectively carry out their mandate within Russia or in the detention facilities set up in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine,&quot; Yatsenko says. According to the Ombudsman&apos;s office, Russia &quot;fundamentally ignores&quot; the mandates set by international humanitarian law for the ICRC and U.N. bodies, especially regarding the treatment of Ukrainian POWs and civilians in captivity. &quot;Despite having the authority, the ICRC and U.N. structures continue to demonstrate &apos;concern and a neutral approach,&apos; which in practice equates to inertia, despite numerous calls from the Ukrainian side to intensify their activities,&quot; the Ombudsman&apos;s office said in a comment for the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It encourages Russia to disregard basic international norms,&quot; it added. On Nov. 20, Ukraine presented the &#x201C;Moscow Convention&#x201D; campaign aimed at exposing Russia&apos;s systemic violations of the Geneva Conventions as well as drawing attention to the ICRC and the U.N.&#x2019;s &#x201C;neutral stance.&#x201D; A Ukrainian soldier who was previously held captive poses for a portrait while undergoing rehabilitation in an unspecified location in Ukraine, on June 6, 2024. (Kostiantyn Liberov / Libkos / Getty Images)A Ukrainian soldier who was previously held captive poses for a portrait while undergoing rehabilitation in Ukraine on June 6, 2024. (Kostiantyn Liberov / Libkos / Getty Images)Based on testimonies from former POWs and their families, the printed &quot;Moscow Conventions&quot; replicate the structure of the original Geneva Conventions but highlight the vastly different &quot;standards&quot; practiced by Russia, such as electric shock torture, physical and psychological abuse, sexual violence, and murder. &quot;Russians treat the Geneva Conventions as mere scraps of paper, something they can blatantly ignore and dismiss,&quot; Lubinets said during the presentation. &quot;Meanwhile, the ICRC has spent this entire time burying its head in the sand&#x2026; not befitting for a professional organization that should be upholding its mandate with dignity,&#x201D; he added. Patrick Griffiths, the spokesperson for the ICRC delegation in Ukraine, says their neutrality is a tool that &quot;works best&quot; for them when it comes to reaching POWs on both sides. &quot;Every decision that we make about what we say or don&apos;t say, what we do or what we don&apos;t do in this armed conflict, the first thought we have is, will it help the people that our mandate is to help?&quot; Griffiths says. &quot;And it&apos;s not in their interests for us to say something that risks losing the humanitarian access that we have limited though it already is, we acknowledge that,&quot; he says. Although the ICRC wants to be able to visit every POW, it is the &quot;obligation of the state&quot; which holds them to grant access, which they can not enforce, Griffiths says. Yatsenko, however, dismissed Griffiths&#x2019; arguments, calling them &quot;excuses&quot; that offer &quot;no constructive solution.&quot; &quot;If we had seen a significant number of changes during these two and a half years of Russian aggression, and if these excuses influenced changes in access for the ICRC to places of detention, then it would be justified. But we do not see such changes,&quot; he says. &quot;Something needs to be changed here.&quot; Even if Ukraine says a million times that it&apos;s not happy with the ICRC&apos;s work &quot;it will not change anything,&quot; says Mikhail Savva, a legal expert from the Center for Civil Liberties, a Ukrainian human rights organization. According to Savva, the biggest issue is that the 1949 Geneva Conventions do not provide any sanction tools; hence, they do not give the ICRC any &quot;enforcement mechanisms.&quot; &quot;It is necessary to raise the issue that the Red Cross (ICRC), and not only it but Ukraine as a state, should have tools to compel any aggressor country to comply with the norms of international humanitarian law,&quot; Savva says. Developing and signing an &quot;additional protocol&quot; to the Geneva Conventions is necessary for that, Savva says, adding that it should have the &quot;same authority as the conventions and should take into account the three years of wartime experience.&quot; A protester holds a placard expressing her opinion during a demonstration in Lviv, Ukraine, on July 31, 2022. (Pavlo Palamarchuk / SOPA Images / LightRocket via Getty Images)Yet he says it would be impossible without the will of state parties to the Geneva Conventions, the same as removing Russia from the U.N. Security Council. Oleksandr Pavlichenko, the Executive Director of the Ukrainian Helsinki Human Rights Union, believes that currently &quot;there is neither a legal means nor political will&quot; to strip Russia of its status in the Security Council. &quot;It would set a precedent for stripping a permanent member of the Security Council of that status. I believe other members, like the U.S., would not want to set such a precedent, as it could later lead to questions about potentially losing their own status, for example.&quot; Savva agrees, saying that &quot;under current legal conditions, this is practically impossible.&quot; &quot;It would mean dismantling the U.N. and creating other organizations. But would that impact the global situation?&quot; he says, adding: &quot;Russia would still have nuclear weapons and remain free from any restrictions altogether.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/how-ukraine-lost-faith-in-red-cross-and-un/	2025-01-22T10:13:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/photo_2024-01-03_18-39-34.jpg
