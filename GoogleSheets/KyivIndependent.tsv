Defense Minister Umerov under investigation for possible abuse of power, office position, media reports	The National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) has launched a criminal investigation into the potential abuse of power, as well as office position by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported on Jan. 28, citing NABU&apos;s statement. On Jan. 23, the Defense Procurement Agency&apos;s (DPA) supervisory board &#xA0;voted unanimously to extend current director Maryna Bezrukova&apos;s contract for another year. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov however overruled the board&apos;s decision on Jan. 24, saying he would not renew Bezrukova&apos;s contract as head of the DPA. He cited allegedly unsatisfactory results as the reason and appointed Rustem Zhmadilov, who also manages the State Logistics Operator (DOT). Umerov also dismissed two agency supervisory board members, Taras Chmut and Yuriy Dzhyhyr. Following Umerov&apos;s move, the Anti-Corruption Action Center filed a complaint with NABU to open an investigation against Umerov on suspicion of alleged abuse of power. Proceedings against Umerov opened at the request of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, NABU said. According to Ukrainian law, if officials have abused their power or position in a manner leading to &quot;serious consequences,&quot;they are punishable by imprisonment for three to six years and disqualification from holding certain positions or engaging in certain activities for up to three years. They must also pay a fine, ranging from Hr 757,000 ($18,000) to Hr 1,514,000 ($36,000). According to Ukrainian law, supervisory boards have the authority to hire and fire the heads of state enterprises unilaterally. This means that legally, after the board&apos;s vote, Bezrukova should take over the Defense Procurement Agency for another year. However, due to amendments recently made to the agency&apos;s charter by the Defense Ministry, which oversees the DPA, the ministry can reverse the supervisory board&apos;s decisions. Anti-corruption activists and lawmakers say the amendments and Umerov&apos;s decision are unlawful. Following Umerov&apos;s move, DPA declared that it continues to operate under Bezrukova&apos;s leadership. Bezrukova took over the agency in January 2024, and her contract expires at the end of January 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/defense-minister-umerov-under-investigation-for-possible-abuse-of-power-office-position/	2025-01-28T12:34:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/MNM_2451.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Putin claims Zelensky doesn't have a right to sign any potential peace deal	Key developments on Jan. 28: Russian President Vladimir Putin has reiterated his claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is &quot;illegitimate&quot; and said that he has no right to sign any documents in potential peace negotiations, according to an interview with the state TV channel Rossiya 1 broadcast on Jan. 28. &quot;Negotiations can be held with anyone,&quot; Putin said. &quot;But due to (Zelensky&apos;s) illegitimacy he has no right to sign anything. If (Zelensky) wants to take part in talks, I will delegate people who will conduct such talks. But the (key) issue is the ultimate signing of the documents.&quot; Russia has widely used the claim that Zelensky is illegitimate in its propaganda in an effort to discredit the Ukrainian government. Major Ukrainian constitutional lawyers and legal experts believe the claim is false and unfounded. Putin also mentioned Zelensky&apos;s Sept. 30, 2022 decree to ban negotiations with Putin. The move came in response to Russia&apos;s illegal annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, which are partially occupied. Putin claimed that, due to his alleged illegitimacy, Zelensky cannot lift his ban on negotiations with Russia. The decree should be revoked before such negotiations begin, and the &quot;legitimacy&quot; of Ukrainian negotiators should be &quot;verified by lawyers,&quot; Putin added. &quot;If we start negotiations now, they will be illegitimate. There is a problem here: when the current head of the regime signed this decree (on banning negotiations), he was a legitimate president, and now he cannot revoke it,&quot; Putin said. He claimed that the decree can only be revoked by the speaker of Ukraine&apos;s parliament, who must have become the country&apos;s acting president after the alleged expiry of Zelensky&apos;s term. &quot;If there is a will, any issue of a legal nature can be resolved. But so far, we haven&apos;t seen such willingness,&quot; Putin said. Under the martial law act passed by Ukraine after Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, presidential, parliamentary and local elections are banned. If martial law had not been imposed, the next presidential election would have been held on March 31, 2024, and Zelensky&apos;s term would have ended on May 20, 2024. Some of Zelensky&apos;s critics claim that the Constitution does not authorize extending his presidential term under martial law. They argue that he ceased to be a legitimate president on May 20. But leading constitutional lawyers dispute this claim, saying the Constitution allows such an extension. Earlier, Putin said that Russia is prepared to hold talks with U.S. President Donald Trump regarding the war in Ukraine. Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov on Jan. 28 refuted the Russian Defense Ministry&apos;s claims that Russian forces had captured the village of Dvorichna in the Kupiansk district, emphasizing that fighting in the area is ongoing, Ukrinform reported. &quot;This is not the first statement of this kind from the Russian side; it is pure propaganda and does not reflect reality,&quot; Syniehubov said. Located 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Kharkiv and 17 kilometers (10 miles) north of Kupiansk, Dvorichna sits on the western bank of the Oskil River, a key geographic feature in the region. Russia has been attempting to secure a foothold on this bank for months, aiming to outflank Ukrainian defenses and threaten a rear attack in Kupiansk.

(DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Andrii Besedin, head of the Kupiansk town military administration, noted earlier in January that Russian troops were trying to establish a bridgehead in Dvorichna to facilitate further advances. Russian forces have ramped up operations near Kupiansk since September, reaching the industrial outskirts of the town in the northeast. Ukrainian troops successfully repelled multiple Russian assaults throughout December. The Italian parliament&apos;s lower house on Jan. 28 approved the prolongation of military support for Ukraine until Dec. 31, 2025, the Italian news agency ANSA reported. Earlier, the Italian Senate approved the measure with 192 votes in favor and 41 against. The parliamentary opposition was divided on the decision to extend military aid to Ukraine. Three parties supported the decision, while two parties opposed it. Italy&apos;s 10 military aid packages to Ukraine have included advanced weapons systems like the French-Italian SAMP/T air defense units. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Jan. 16 that Ukraine would receive another military aid package from Italy. Prior to that, Umerov met his Italian counterpart, Guido Crosetto, in Kyiv. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who took office in late 2022, has consistently supported Kyiv and pledged unwavering assistance until the war ends. Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) reported on Jan. 28 that it had dismantled a Russian spy network tasked with gathering intelligence on Ukrainian aircraft for strikes on aviation infrastructure. The operation, conducted near a military airfield, led to the arrest of two agents who were caught photographing a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet during takeoff, the SBU said. The SBU identified the suspects as two residents of Kremenchuk in Poltava Oblast, aged 22 and 21, recruited by a female officer of Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB) whose identity has been established. The agents were allegedly tasked with collecting detailed information on military airfields housing F-16 jets and helicopters, including their geolocation and photographic evidence. This intelligence was reportedly intended to help Russia adjust its missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian aviation facilities. To fulfill their mission, the agents planned to travel across five regions of Ukraine, using public transportation and renting short-term accommodations near airfields for espionage purposes. The SBU said it had intercepted and documented their reconnaissance efforts at an early stage, preventing any successful data transfer. Both suspects were detained while photographing an F-16 jet and have been taken into custody. They now face life imprisonment on treason charges. Ukraine received its first F-16 jets in August 2024, a year after the NATO-led fighter jet coalition pledged to train Ukrainian pilots and supply aircraft. Despite challenges, including a deadly crash during a massive Russian attack on Aug. 26, Ukrainian pilots have effectively used the jets to counter Russian aerial threats. Ukraine&apos;s government has confirmed the dismissal of Dmytro Klimenkov from his position as deputy defense minister, said Taras Melnychuk, the government&apos;s parliamentary representative, on Jan. 28. The decision follows ongoing tensions within the Defense Ministry over its weapons procurement process, which has been heavily scrutinized amid reform efforts. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced Klimenkov&apos;s dismissal last week, claiming his deputy had &quot;failed&quot; the task of defense procurement. Concurrently, Umerov said he would not renew Maryna Bezrukova&apos;s contract as head of the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA). Klimenkov joined the Defense Ministry from the State Property Fund, where he worked under Umerov&apos;s leadership. Appointed deputy defense minister on Oct. 5, 2023, he was responsible for overseeing procurement for the Armed Forces. Bezrukova, appointed in January 2024 to lead procurement reforms following corruption scandals, had her contract extended by the DPA&apos;s supervisory board earlier this month. Under Ukrainian law, supervisory boards can hire and fire state enterprise leaders, making Umerov&apos;s refusal to renew her contract legally contentious. Anti-corruption activists and lawmakers criticized the move, labeling it &quot;unlawful&quot; and warning that such actions could undermine efforts to reform Ukraine&apos;s defense procurement system. Bezrukova&apos;s tenure highlighted internal disputes over procurement practices. At the start of her role, Bezrukova reported pressure from Klimenkov to sign a contract for 500,000 artillery shells from a manufacturer owned by the Strategic Industries Ministry.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-denies-capture-of-another-village-in-kharkiv-oblast-italy-extents-military-assistance-for-ukraine-in-2025/	2025-01-28T12:32:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1250824254.jpg

What Trump's first week in office says about his stance on Ukraine	For those with a vested interest in Ukraine, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s first week in office was a bit of a rollercoaster. His inauguration speech on Jan. 21 made no explicit mention of Ukraine or Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, prompting some to question if either was anywhere near a priority for the new president. During his first presidential term, Trump famously praised Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has also repeatedly criticized U.S. aid to Ukraine during the election campaign ahead of his second term, prompting many in Ukraine and the West to worry about the future of assistance from Ukraine&#x2019;s biggest donor. &quot;I can&#x2019;t say if things will be better for us (now Trump has been inaugurated) because Trump is definitely not a sympathizer of Ukraine,&quot; &#x201C;Volvo,&#x201D; a Ukrainian military medic told the Kyiv Independent at the time. But a few hours later, comments from Trump began to give an indication that he was at least open to taking a hard line on Russia, saying he would likely impose additional sanctions against Moscow if Putin fails to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine. &quot;Sounds likely,&quot; he said responding to a question from a reporter in the White House. While the off-hand comment wasn&apos;t anything close to a policy announcement, on Jan. 22, Trump took to his social media platform Truth Social and came out guns blazing, saying he would be doing Putin &quot;a very big favor&quot; by helping end the war. &quot;If a deal is not reached, I will have no other choice but to put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries,&quot; he said. &quot;We can do it the easy way or the hard way,&quot; he said in reference to negotiating an end to the war, adding, &quot;the easy way is always better.&quot; While stressing that he is &quot;not looking to hurt Russia&quot; and maintaining that he has &quot;always had a very good relationship&quot; with Putin, Trump added, &quot;It&apos;s time to make a deal. No more lives should be lost.&quot; Ambassador Kurt Volker, who served as U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations in 2017-2019, during Trump&#x2019;s previous tenure, told the Kyiv Independent: &quot;These are very strong statements coming from Trump.&#x201D; &quot;And they do a couple of things. They establish that Putin is the one who has to act &#x2014; it&apos;s not both sides that need to show restraint. This is all &apos;Russia has to stop the war, Putin has to stop,&apos;&quot; he said. &quot;Secondly, it&apos;s establishing that Putin is in a weak position and Trump is in a strong position, which is also very good.&quot; Trump doubled down on his position while appearing via videolink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan 23. U.S. President Donald Trump is seen on a giant screen during his address by video conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 23, 2025. (Fabrice Coffrini / AFP via Getty Images)Asked if there would be a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia by the time of next year&apos;s World Economic Forum, he replied: &quot;Well you&apos;ll have to ask Russia. Ukraine is ready to make a deal.&quot; Volker said such comments were important to &quot;get that psychological dynamic straight&quot; as Trump defines his relationship with Putin before peace negotiations begin, adding that the fact Putin later responded showed it worked. Speaking to reporters on Jan. 24, Putin claimed Russia was ready for talks with Trump on ending the war in Ukraine, but made a clumsy attempt to shift blame for them not starting onto President Volodymyr Zelensky. He pointed out a decree signed by Zelensky in October 2022 which declared negotiations with Putin &quot;impossible&quot; while leaving the door open to discussions with Russia under different leadership. Zelensky signed the decree after Russia announced the illegal annexation of four Ukrainian regions, all of which it only partially controlled. &quot;How can negotiations be resumed if they are officially banned?&quot; Putin asked. &quot;This is a deflection by Putin,&quot; Volker said, adding his claim about being ready to talk was a &quot;lie.&quot; &quot;He knows very well that Zelensky has said he wants to end the war,&quot; he added. In Ukraine, Trump&apos;s strong stance on Russia has been welcomed, but cautiously, tempered by an expectation that Putin has little desire to enter peace negotiations regardless of the threats coming from the U.S. &quot;The problem is not Trump, his ideas or expectations, the problem is Putin,&quot; Oleksandr Merezhko, the chair of the Ukrainian parliament&apos;s foreign affairs committee, told the Kyiv Independent. Merezhko said he expected Trump to soon become &quot;disillusioned&quot; with Putin when he doesn&apos;t respond to the threats. &quot;I hope that Trump will have to take a firmer stance on Putin, as soon as he realizes that Putin has no intention to negotiate in earnest,&quot; he added. While Trump may have quietly discarded his claim that he could end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion &quot;in 24 hours,&quot; his comments during his first week still indicate he believes he can end the war relatively swiftly &#x2014; but time may actually be on Putin&apos;s side. Aside from the threats about sanctions, Trump also said at Davos he would ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to lower the price of oil, saying it would end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine &quot;immediately.&quot; OPEC consists of 12 countries including Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, which collectively account for around 30% of the global oil supply. By agreeing to lower or raise the amount of oil they all produce, OPEC can dramatically affect the global oil price. Another Trump policy &#x2014; declaring open season on drilling for U.S. oil and gas &#x2014; could also potentially push down prices and box out Russian oil.

(Alexander Manzyuk/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)More sanctions and lower global oil prices would deplete Russia&apos;s main source of revenue that it uses to fund its war in Ukraine, but a recent analysis in Foreign Policy suggested any effects would likely take months to significantly hamper the Kremlin&apos;s war machine. On the streets of Kyiv, there is little expectation that Trump will be able to end the war swiftly, or even that he can do it at all, and that ultimately, it is still up to Ukrainians to fight for it themselves. &quot;For now, it&apos;s too early to judge (Trump),&quot; 18-year-old student Mykola told the Kyiv Independent on Jan. 28, adding: &quot;I think we can only bring peace by our own actions.&quot; &quot;The only thing that can affect Russia is that we will make our shells and destroy the Russians directly at the front.&quot; According to Volker, the next step for the Trump administration will be a visit to Kyiv and other European capitals by Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s peace envoy for Ukraine, during which he will be &quot;gathering perspectives and information&quot; which he will then brief his boss on. &quot;I think the best advice for the Trump team is to do exactly what Trump is doing &#x2014; keep it simple and don&apos;t get bogged down in these side issues that Russia will throw up like saying we need elections in Ukraine,&quot; he said. &quot;Putin will just make stuff up and we should not negotiate on that at all. We should say it&apos;s none of his business, just stop the war. And what we do is we get a ceasefire. And then we have to be strong so that we deter future attacks,&quot; he added.

Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 11	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 11 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Jan. 13&#x2013;19, 2025. This newsletter was until recently titled &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief.&quot; The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Application process closes for head of Bureau of Economic Security The submission period for applications to compete for the position of head of the Bureau of Economic Security (known in Ukraine by its acronym BEB) has officially closed. While the exact number of candidates remains undisclosed, preliminary indications suggest a strong turnout, with over 40 individuals expected to have submitted their applications. Detailed information, including the list of candidates, is anticipated later this week. The selection process will now move to the verification stage, where applications will be reviewed for compliance with requirements. Following this, candidates will undergo a rigorous six-stage evaluation. The process includes assessments of general competencies, legislative knowledge, and the ability to resolve practical cases. Integrity checks will also be a mandatory component of the selection process. Ultimately, the commission overseeing the competition will choose no more than two finalists to advance. Ukrainian business associations warn against risks of repealing &apos;Lozovyi amendments&apos; According to Forbes Ukraine, several Ukrainian business associations, including SUP (Union of Ukrainian Entrepreneurs), Diia.City United, and the Federation of Employers of Ukraine, along with six other industry organizations, urged lawmakers to reject four draft laws proposing the repeal of certain provisions of the &quot;Lozovyi Amendments.&quot; The amendments, which regulate pre-trial investigation time limits, are part of a commitment Ukraine made under its memorandum with the IMF, with implementation expected by the end of December 2024. Business leaders warn that repealing these provisions could expose entrepreneurs to increased pressure from law enforcement and delay the closure of legal cases, further burdening the business environment. Integrity checks will also be a mandatory component of the selection process. Ultimately, the commission overseeing the competition will choose no more than two finalists to advance. Ukrainian defense minister replaces Defense Procurement Agency head, defying supervisory board decision On Jan. 23, the Supervisory Board of the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) voted to extend the contract of Maryna Bezrukova, the agency&#x2019;s current head, for another year. According to anti-corruption watchdogs, this decision fully complied with the law governing state-owned property and the agency&#x2019;s charter. However, on Jan. 24, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov publicly rejected the board&#x2019;s decision, refusing to recognize the contract extension. The minister also removed two state representatives from the Supervisory Board, Yuriy Dzhyhyr and Taras Chmut, and recommended dismissing Deputy Minister Dmytro Klimenkov, who oversees the DPA&#x2019;s operations. Umerov further announced plans to appoint Arsen Zhumadilov, head of the State Operator for Non-Lethal Acquisitions (DOT), as the new DPA Director. The leadership change has already been reflected in YouControl, a Ukrainian public registry system. On Jan. 25, Anastasia Radina, head of the Ukrainian parliament&#x2019;s anti-corruption committee, called on Umerov to resign. Radina accused the minister of undermining defense procurement reform and engaging in manual interference with procurement processes.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-11/	2025-01-28T09:06:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194027012--1-.jpg
NATO official ties assassination plot against Rheinmetall CEO to Russian sabotage campaign	Sabotage acts in NATO countries in recent years have included threats to assassinate weapons industry leaders, particularly the German arms maker Rheinmetall&apos;s CEO Armin Papperger, NATO&apos;s Deputy Assistant Secretary-General James Appathurai said on Jan. 28. Since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Russian hybrid operations aimed at destabilizing the situation in the countries that support Ukraine have intensified. Speaking at the European Parliament, Appathurai confirmed the threats against Papperger, which had previously been circulating only in the media, Reuters reported. In July 2024, U.S. and German intelligence discovered a Russian-linked plot to assassinate Papperger, according to CNN. Following the incident, Germany provided Papperger with the same top-level security as Chancellor Olaf Scholz. In April 2024, supporters of the left-wing extremist RAF movement announced that they had burned down Papperger&apos;s garden house, accusing him of &quot;profiting&quot; from arms sales. Appathurai also said that the West had sometimes succeeded in stopping Russia from committing acts of sabotage by setting red lines at the highest level. One example is when incendiary devices destined for DHL flights were detected in a German warehouse. According to Appathurai, the sabotage campaign included &quot;derailment of trains, acts of arson, attacks on politicians&apos; property, threats to plot to assassinate industry leaders like, publicly, the head of Rheinmetall, but there were other plots as well.&quot; Appathurai added that NATO characterizes the current level of sabotage as a &quot;record high.&quot; NATO allies clearly understand that they &quot;need to be more robust&quot; in responding to recurring incidents, particularly in the Baltic Sea, he added. NATO aims to agree on a strategy for tackling hybrid threats before the alliance&apos;s summit in The Hague at the end of June, according to Reuters. Rheinmetall provides weapons and equipment to Ukraine under contracts with the German government, such as Leopard 1 tanks, mortar shells, and drone surveillance systems, among other weapons. In late July, Rheinmetall announced that it had received an order from the Ukrainian government to begin the construction of an ammunition factory in Ukraine. The company previously said it planned to open at least four factories in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-ties-attempted-assassination-plot-against-rheinmetall-ceo-to-russian-sabotage-campaign/	2025-01-28T08:35:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2076692591.jpg
Russian oil sales to China and India stall as sanctions increase costs, Reuters reports	Trade for March-loading Russian oil in China and India has stalled due to soaring shipping costs triggered by U.S. sanctions introduced on Jan. 10, Reuters reported on Jan. 28. The sanctions target nearly 200 vessels in Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; major oil companies, and associated entities, significantly complicating Moscow&apos;s crude exports. The disruption has led to stalled trade in Russian crude loaded for March delivery as rising shipping costs created a significant price gap between buyers and sellers, according to Reuters. Offers for March ESPO Blend crude from Russia&apos;s Pacific port of Kozmino have jumped to premiums of $3&#x2013;$5 per barrel over ICE Brent on a delivered ex-ship (DES) basis to China, following a sharp surge in Aframax tanker freight rates by millions of dollars. Before the new sanctions, demand for Russian ESPO Blend crude was robust, with spot premiums rising to nearly $2 per barrel due to firming prices for competing Iranian grades and winter demand. India is also seeing a decline in Russian oil offers. Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd reported that no new offers for March deliveries have been received, with expectations for a drop in cargoes compared to January and December. Last year, Russian crude accounted for 36% of India&apos;s imports and nearly 20% of China&apos;s. Adding to the strain, Indian banks have blocked payments for Russian oil imports following the latest U.S. sanctions, Energy Intelligence reported. U.S. President Donald Trump warned Russia on Jan. 22 to &quot;make a deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine, cautioning that continued resistance would result in additional sanctions, tariffs, and taxes on Russian goods.	https://kyivindependent.com/china-india-halt-russian-oil-trade-over-rising-tanker-tariffs-media-reports/	2025-01-28T07:13:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1477537303.jpg
Uzbekistan Airways reroute European flights to avoid Russia, Belarus as 'precaution'	Uzbekistan Airways airliners have changed their routes when flying to Europe to avoid Russian and Belarusian airspace as a &quot;precautionary measure,&quot; the Uzbek news outlet Repost reported on Jan. 28. The news comes a month after an Azerbaijani airliner crashed in Kazakhstan after flying through the Russian airspace. Baku said that Russian air defenses mistakenly opened fire against the plane, bringing it down and killing 38 of the 67 people on board. &quot;These are simply precautionary measures and, to some extent, route optimization,&quot; the press service of Uzbekistan Airways was quoted as saying by Repost, claiming the change is not directly connected to the downing of the Azerbaijani plane. Since Jan. 20, Uzbekistan Airways airliners fly over Azerbaijan and Turkey when heading west. The Azerbaijani airliner was traveling from Baku to Grozny in Russia&apos;s Chechen Republic on Dec. 25, 2024, but was forced to change course and crashed near the Kazakh city of Aktau. Independent observers and Azerbaijani officials said that it was hit unintentionally by Russian air defense fire while attempting to land at Grozny&#x2019;s airport. The airport was allegedly under a Ukrainian drone attack, and Russia&#x2019;s military failed to notify the airport in time to deny all civilian passenger planes entry into its airspace to avoid suffering fire by the activated anti-air missile system. Russian authorities claimed the plane crashed due to hitting birds, but Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev directly accused Russia of downing the plane and demanded an admission of guilt and reparations, straining relations among otherwise close allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/uzbek-airliners-reroute-european-flights-to-avoid-russia-belarus/	2025-01-28T06:14:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1138938336.jpg
Pure propaganda' — Kharkiv Oblast governor denies Russian claims of capturing Dvorichna	Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov on Jan. 28 refuted the Russian Defense Ministry&apos;s claims that Russian forces had captured the village of Dvorichna in the Kupiansk district, emphasizing that fighting in the area is ongoing, Ukrinform reported. &quot;This is not the first statement of this kind from the Russian side; it is pure propaganda and does not reflect reality,&quot; Syniehubov said. Located 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Kharkiv and 17 kilometers (10 miles) north of Kupiansk, Dvorichna sits on the western bank of the Oskil River, a key geographic feature in the region. Russia has been attempting to secure a foothold on this bank for months, aiming to outflank Ukrainian defenses and threaten a rear attack in Kupiansk.

(DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Andrii Besedin, head of the Kupiansk town military administration, noted earlier in January that Russian troops were trying to establish a bridgehead in Dvorichna to facilitate further advances.

Ukrainian troops successfully repelled multiple Russian assaults throughout December.	https://kyivindependent.com/pure-propaganda-kharkiv-governor-denies-russian-claims-of-capturing-dvorichna/	2025-01-28T05:50:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1797516659.jpeg
Russian physiologist Pavlov’s statue dismantled in central Kyiv	Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov&#x2019;s statue was removed from Kyiv&#x2019;s Pechersk district over symbolizing Russia&#x2019;s imperial past and Pavlov&apos;s controversial experiments on animals, the Kyiv city administration said on Jan. 27. During centuries of Russian imperial rule, Moscow imposed the supremacy of the Russian language, nation, and culture over Ukraine. The Russian cultural dominance largely continued during the Soviet period, and statues for Russian figures were erected until Ukraine gained independence in 1991. Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion has accelerated Ukraine&apos;s efforts to de-Russify public spaces. According to the city&apos;s administration, Kyiv authorities have removed 59 objects as part of the campaign since 2022. Pavlov&apos;s monument is currently placed in a specialized site and will be transferred to the Oleg Antonov State Aviation Museum in Kyiv, where similar objects are stored. The decision on the monument&apos;s removal was made in July 2023. Pavlov, who lived between 1849 and 1936, was born and spent much of his life in modern-day Russia. While considered a pioneer in neurology and physiology, the founder of classical conditioning has also been accused of conducting cruel experiments on animals, most famously dogs.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-physiologist-pavlovs-statue-removed-from-central-kyiv/	2025-01-28T05:43:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/thumb_418869_800_600_0_0_auto-1.jpg
3 key takeaways from Davos from Ukraine’s economy minister	The discussions at the World Economic Forum in Davos were a stark reminder of how interconnected the global economy is, and how Ukraine&#x2019;s stability &#x2014; or lack thereof &#x2014; affects us all. From military aid to economic sanctions, the steps we take now will shape the future not just for Ukraine, but for the world. The war Russia has unleashed on Ukraine is not only a threat to our country, but also a destabilizing force for the entire world economy. One of the clearest signs of this disruption was the unprecedented surge in global wheat prices, soaring to over $450 per ton in spring 2022, driving hunger across the globe. Or consider the speculative spike in gas prices last year when Russia attacked Ukraine&#x2019;s underground gas storage facilities. Every missile Russia targets at Ukraine is a strike at the heart of the global economy. If we are serious about global stability, we must address the root cause: Russia&#x2019;s aggression. As long as instability persists in Ukraine, it will reverberate around the world. Here are the key takeaways from Davos that underscore the shared responsibility we all have in securing Ukraine&#x2019;s future. First, military and economic aid have been, and must remain, at the forefront of our efforts. In partnership with governments, businesses, and financial institutions, we&#x2019;ve created a robust ecosystem that has kept Ukraine standing. This support drives recovery and development, particularly in defense technology, and it has allowed Ukraine&#x2019;s economy to stay afloat in the face of unrelenting war. As &#x201C;The Economist&#x201D; rightly put it, Ukraine is winning the economic war &#x2014; an accomplishment that belongs to all of us. Second, sanctions and blocking Russia&#x2019;s shadow fleet have long been vital tools in the fight against Russian aggression. U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s recent comments in Davos about Russian oil are a step in the right direction. The numbers back it up: According to the Kyiv School of Economics, Russia has lost a staggering $78.5 billion in oil export revenue since December 2022 due to sanctions. The oil tanker Eagle S is anchored near Kilpilahti port in Porvoo, Gulf of Finland, on Jan. 13, 2025. (Vesa Moilanen / Lehtikuva / AFP)The private sector must play its part too. I call on business leaders worldwide to withdraw from the Russian market. Such actions are as effective as sanctions, delivering a direct blow to the Russian economy. The idea that business is somehow apolitical is outdated &#x2014; businesses are powerful forces that can shape outcomes, for better or for worse. And third, a strong economy supports a strong military. That&#x2019;s why our vision for a self-sufficient economy is grounded in five key steps: expanding export logistics, restoring energy capacities, confiscating Russia&#x2019;s sovereign assets to support Ukraine&#x2019;s recovery, investing in the defense industry and Ukrainian companies, and encouraging the return of Ukrainians to Ukraine. While the Ukrainian government has focused on industrial policy &#x2014; contributing to economic growth even in the third year of full-scale war, with a projected 3.6% growth rate in 2024 &#x2014; private companies have an equally critical role in shaping long-term security guarantees for Ukraine. Security measures have already shown their value. Take the Black Sea Grain Corridor, for example. Initially blocked by Russia, the corridor was only reopened when we secured military protection for the routes and installed air defense systems to safeguard export infrastructure. This allowed Ukrainian exports to grow by 15% last year. To kickstart Ukraine&#x2019;s large-scale reconstruction and stabilize the global economy, Ukraine needs long-term security guarantees. This is not just a Ukrainian issue &#x2014; it&#x2019;s a global responsibility, one shared by Ukraine, its partners, and the private sector.

Spanish Foreign Minister Albares visits Ukraine to reaffirm support amid war	Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares arrived in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Jan. 28, reaffirming Spain&apos;s support for Ukraine amid Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. &quot;This year will be a year of peace,&quot; Albares wrote on X, emphasizing Spain&apos;s commitment to a &quot;just peace&quot; that ensures Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty and freedom. The Spanish Foreign Ministry outlined three primary objectives for the trip: reinforcing political and diplomatic backing, providing humanitarian aid, and protecting Ukraine&apos;s cultural heritage, according to the Spanish news outlet La Razon. During his visit, Albares is set to hold talks with his Ukrainian counterpart, Andrii Sybiha, to discuss Spain&apos;s political support and its role in Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction. &quot;I am grateful to Spain for its support and look forward to meaningful talks today,&quot; Sybiha said. The two officials met ahead of the discussions to honor fallen Ukrainian soldiers at the Lychakiv cemetery in Lviv. In May, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement, under which Spain pledged 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in aid for 2024 and 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion) by 2027. This support encompasses economic, military, and humanitarian assistance.	https://kyivindependent.com/spanish-foreign-minister-albares-visits-ukraine-to-reaffirm-support-amid-war/	2025-01-28T05:03:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-28_12-13-51.jpg
EU considering new trade regime with Ukraine, media reports	The European Union does not plan to extend the preferential trade agreement framework in its current form past its June 5 expiration date and is considering a new set of rules instead, the Polish news portal RMF24 reported on Jan. 28. While the European Commission allegedly does not plan to reinstate pre-invasion trade rules, it is considering alternatives within the 2016 Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) framework, including quotas for agricultural products and additional safeguards. The EU lifted customs duties on Ukrainian agricultural products in 2022 to alleviate the country&apos;s economy amid Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. This led to large-scale protests among European farmers, namely in Poland, who claimed the influx of cheaper Ukrainian products was threatening their businesses. The newly proposed framework would establish specific export and import volumes, potentially aiding Ukraine&apos;s integration into the EU single market while addressing concerns from member states about agricultural imports. European Agriculture Commissioner Christophe Hansen reportedly noted widespread support among agriculture ministers for transitioning to a &quot;more stable DCFTA agreement&quot; instead of extending the current regime. Preliminary technical negotiations between the EU and Ukraine have reportedly begun, with formal discussions expected soon. The EU&apos;s current free-trade scheme has already been updated with an automatic safeguard mechanism for sensitive sectors, such as eggs, poultry, sugar, oats, maize, hulled grains, and honey. Poland has implemented import bans on certain Ukrainian products, such as grain, citing negative impacts on Polish agriculture.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-considers-new-trade-framework-with-ukraine/	2025-01-28T04:44:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-497631536.jpg
Government dismisses Deputy Defense Minister Klimenkov amid procurement tensions	Ukraine&apos;s government has confirmed the dismissal of Dmytro Klimenkov from his position as deputy defense minister, said Taras Melnychuk, the government&apos;s parliamentary representative, on Jan. 28. The decision follows ongoing tensions within the Defense Ministry over its weapons procurement process, which has been heavily scrutinized amid reform efforts. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced Klimenkov&apos;s dismissal last week, claiming his deputy had &quot;failed&quot; the task of defense procurement. Concurrently, Umerov said he would not renew Maryna Bezrukova&apos;s contract as head of the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA). Klimenkov joined the Defense Ministry from the State Property Fund, where he worked under Umerov&apos;s leadership. Appointed deputy defense minister on Oct. 5, 2023, he was responsible for overseeing procurement for the Armed Forces. Bezrukova, appointed in January 2024 to lead procurement reforms following corruption scandals, had her contract extended by the DPA&apos;s supervisory board earlier this month. Under Ukrainian law, supervisory boards can hire and fire state enterprise leaders, making Umerov&apos;s refusal to renew her contract legally contentious. Anti-corruption activists and lawmakers criticized the move, labeling it &quot;unlawful&quot; and warning that such actions could undermine efforts to reform Ukraine&apos;s defense procurement system. Bezrukova&apos;s tenure highlighted internal disputes over procurement practices. At the start of her role, Bezrukova reported pressure from Klimenkov to sign a contract for 500,000 artillery shells from a manufacturer owned by the Strategic Industries Ministry. She expressed concerns about the company&apos;s limited production capacity, workforce shortages, and gunpowder deficit. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) also investigated the manufacturer&apos;s director and a manager for inflating prices. An initial Defense Ministry inspection supported Bezrukova&apos;s concerns, estimating the company&apos;s capacity at 300,000&#x2013;350,000 shells. However, the ministry later reversed its assessment, asserting that the company could meet the contract requirements. Despite reservations, Bezrukova signed the contract. By the summer, the manufacturer fell behind schedule. When Klimenkov asked her to extend delivery deadlines, Bezrukova refused and pushed for alternative suppliers, straining her relationship with ministry officials. The Defense Ministry announced on Nov. 26 that it was investigating the contract and would pivot to delivering imported shells instead.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-dismisses-deputy-defense-minister-klimenkov-amid-procurement-tensions/	2025-01-28T04:18:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/_KZT9409-1.jpg
Swedish police detain man for trying to drive car into Russian Embassy grounds	A man attempted to drive a passenger car through the gates of Russia&#x2019;s Embassy in Stockholm on Jan. 28, the Swedish television channel SVT Nyheter reported. Shortly after the Embassy&#x2019;s notice, the Swedish police arrived at the scene and detained the suspected perpetrator. The incident occurred in the early hours of Jan. 28. The Swedish media reported that the suspect was a 45-year-old man but said his nationality is unknown. No injuries were reported in the incident, which is investigated as &quot;gross trespassing.&quot; Russia&#x2019;s Embassy to Sweden alleged the man was of Ukrainian origin and had been attempting to break into the territory of the Embassy and Russia&#x2019;s trade representation in Stockholm in 2015 and 2018. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. This is not the first time the Embassy has been targeted. An unidentified drone dropped paint on the building in late 2024. Sweden&#x2019;s Embassy in Moscow was also vandalized before that incident. Tensions between Western countries and Russia have mounted since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/swedish-police-detain-man-for-attempting-to-ram-car-into-russian-emassy/	2025-01-28T04:13:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1231048150.jpg
Davos heard Ukraine’s call, but will Europe seize the opportunity?	&#x201C;We&#x2019;re at yet another turning point,&#x201D; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told global leaders in Davos last week, &#x201C;which some see as a problem for Europe, but others call a chance. Europe must establish itself as a strong global player, as an indispensable player.&#x201D; Zelensky is completely right. He is also correct &#x2014; as was emphasized both by Ukraine&#x2019;s government delegation and during events at Ukraine House Davos &#x2014; that realizing Ukraine&#x2019;s potential is critical to creating a strong Europe: economically, technologically, and geopolitically. Europe must invest to unlock this potential. Geopolitically, Europe desperately needs to strengthen its military capabilities and revitalize its defense industry. Ukraine has the largest and most experienced military in Europe and some of the world&#x2019;s most advanced drone technology. Its defense industry has demonstrated an exceptional ability to rapidly scale up high-quality production at low cost &#x2014; exactly what Europe requires. The success of the green energy transition, which is key to European energy independence, depends on access to critical raw materials. Ukraine has some of the largest deposits of these resources in the world and can act as a catalyst for a Europe powered by cheap and abundant renewable energy, fueling a vibrant economy. Europe is also lagging in technology, while Ukraine boasts one of the strongest tech sectors in the region. The entrepreneurial attitudes and deep pool of tech talent in Ukraine are exactly what Europe needs to regain its position as a global leader in innovation. As Europe grapples with challenges related to immigration, Ukraine&#x2019;s robust agricultural sector can also help address global food insecurity. Ukraine&#x2019;s recent contributions to Syria are an example of its ability to support some of the world&#x2019;s poorest nations. Perhaps the most desperately needed resource Ukraine brings to Europe is something else altogether: grit and ambition. It&#x2019;s remarkable that Europe often acts and thinks as if it is weak &#x2014; when it is, or should be, anything but. Europe remains the richest and most economically advanced region in the world outside the United States. It also includes some of the fastest-growing economies, such as Poland, the Czech Republic, and the Baltic states. Geopolitically, Europe&#x2019;s recent history is one of triumph, not decline. In the year I was born, the eastern border of free Europe passed through Germany. Since then, the European Union has doubled in size, successfully integrating states once under Soviet control or influence. For the first time in history, nearly all of Europe is united both geopolitically and economically &#x2014; a feat unmatched even by the Romans. Instead of wondering about U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s next move, the world&#x2019;s focus should be on Europe. Did the messages land? In the Swiss mountains, at least, Ukraine&#x2019;s pitch seemed to resonate with political leaders and investors. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen how nods of agreement will translate into practical actions. People watch a broadcast of Donald Trump&apos;s presidential inauguration at Ukraine House in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 20, 2025, amid the World Economic Forum. (Stefan Wermuth / Bloomberg via Getty Images)I, for one, am optimistic. Trump has ended a long period of uncertainty about the U.S. position by clearly stating that Russia &#x2014; not Ukraine &#x2014; needs to be pressured for lasting peace to be achieved. His message that Europe must take greater responsibility for its own security, including Ukraine&#x2019;s, is also welcome. While &#x201C;America First&#x201D; poses both economic and geopolitical risks for Europe, it also adds urgency to Ukraine&#x2019;s message about the need for European strength. This creates fertile ground for increasing foreign investment in Ukraine&#x2019;s military capabilities and defense industry &#x2014; a point underscored by former Ukrainian Strategic Industries Minister Oleksandr Kamyshin and his team during a marathon of bilateral meetings in Davos. Many remain skeptical about civilian private sector investments in Ukraine while the war continues. But this skepticism is overblown. Right now, even as it fights for its existence, Ukraine is one of the fastest-growing economies in Europe. The end of the war, along with Ukraine&#x2019;s future accession to the EU, represents additional opportunities for growth &#x2014; not prerequisites for investment. Conversations with investors already active in Ukraine confirm this. While the war presents serious challenges, pragmatic and resilient businesses continue to thrive &#x2014; strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s economy now and laying the foundation for future growth. Nervous investors who believe visiting Ukraine is too dangerous are deluding themselves out of the most important European growth opportunity of the 21st century. Ukraine House Davos directly challenged foreign investors to muster some courage by offering free Ukrzaliznytsia train ticket vouchers at their events. Not all will take the opportunity, but enough will to make a difference.

Trump’s Russia sanctions might be what finally works	Just one week into his presidency, U.S. President Donald Trump has hinted at his approach to U.S. sanctions on Russia. On Truth Social last week, he called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to &#x201C;settle now and STOP this ridiculous War! IT&#x2019;S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE,&#x201D; adding, &#x201C;If we don&#x2019;t make a &#x2018;deal,&#x2019; and soon, I have no other choice but to put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States, and various other participating countries.&#x201D; This not-so-subtle threat targets not only the Kremlin but also nations still doing business with Russia. Writing in these pages in November, I noted two points. First, Trump is no stranger to using sanctions and other coercive economic tools. During his first term, Trump leveraged sanctions expansively against Iran, Venezuela, and North Korea. Second, Trump loves making deals, and in doing so, he needs to win, avoid appearing weak, and, if possible, generate profit for the American people. Trump&#x2019;s Truth Social post was thus predictable, but it raises several questions, chief among them: &quot;What sort of deal?&quot; and &quot;What kind of sanctions? The answer to the second question is somewhat easier to predict than the first. After three years of escalating sanctions, trade, and financial restrictions on Russia, Ukraine&#x2019;s allies have undoubtedly had an effect. But the slow and laborious pace at which sanctions have been revealed has allowed Russia to adapt and minimize disruption. Many point to the parlous state of the Russian economy, its high inflation rate, and economic slowdown. This is true, and indeed, 2025 looks set to be the toughest year for the Russian economy since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion. But will it be tough enough to force Putin to rethink if sufficient revenue &#x2014; particularly from the sale of oil &#x2014; continues to flow in? And herein lies the possible foundation of &#x201C;a deal.&#x201D; The Achilles&#x2019; heel of international sanctions is Russia&#x2019;s ability to sell oil. Despite sanctions, many buyers still purchase Russian energy, providing the Kremlin with vital revenue to finance its war. With few exceptions, such as immobilizing Russian Central Bank assets, Western policymakers have moved cautiously with sanctions, particularly where they fear their decisions might roil commodity or energy markets. This restrained approach resembles the first part of the Monty Python fish-slapping dance: irritating the Kremlin but not delivering the decisive blow. Trump, however, seems eager to take on the second part: delivering the financial punch he believes will force Putin to strike a deal. A fisherman carries his belongings on a sled on the ice of the Gulf of Finland against the backdrop of the St. Petersburg Oil Terminal in St. Petersburg, Russia, on March 6, 2024. (Artem Priakhin/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Russia&#x2019;s reliance on oil exports is not just a weakness of international sanctions but also a critical vulnerability for the Kremlin. Without this revenue, the dire state of the Russian economy and its ability to fund its illegal war of aggression in Ukraine would become perilous. Trump recognizes this &#x2014; and sees an opportunity. Trump has already called on OPEC countries to reduce the price of oil, arguing that cheaper oil would end Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine &#x201C;immediately,&#x201D; further suggesting that OPEC countries&#x2019; decision to maintain high oil prices makes them &#x201C;to a certain extent responsible&#x201D; for the war. You can plainly see the seeds of a deal forming in the President&#x2019;s mind. Trump&#x2019;s Truth Social post hints that he is prepared to wield every economic tool at his disposal &#x2014; taxes, tariffs, and sanctions &#x2014; to target Russian oil sales. To date, there is little evidence that Russia has lost much of its oil market, beyond countries that are Ukraine&#x2019;s closest allies in the G7. Trump could launch a &#x201C;maximum pressure&#x201D; campaign aimed at cutting off these buyers. Observers may question where these nations would source their energy instead. Trump&#x2019;s answer? The United States, which is increasingly positioned as a major oil and gas exporter. By coercing countries to abandon Russian energy, Trump envisions boosting U.S. exports, simultaneously undermining the Kremlin and profiting the American economy. Trump prides himself on his deal-making skills. His worldview is driven by the need to coerce, cajole, and, if necessary, bully to achieve his goals. After three years of gentle and intermittent slapping of Russia by Western sanctions, the stage is set for the final sanctions push. The new occupant of the White House undoubtedly feels he is the man for the job and clearly believes that his love of economic tools and maximum pressure will indeed &#x201C;get the deal done.&#x201D; For Trump, peace and profit would surely be the ultimate deal.

Germany ramps up Russian LNG imports via EU ports, report says	Germany&apos;s imports of Russian liquified natural gas (LNG) via other EU countries continue to rise despite restrictions on direct shipments, the Financial Times wrote on Jan. 28, citing a report by Belgian, German, and Ukrainian NGOs. Following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Europe began to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels to avoid financing the Kremlin&#x2019;s war chest. Despite these efforts, Europe&apos;s imports of Russian LNG, which is largely not subject to sanctions, have soared to record levels in 2024. Germany&#x2019;s national energy company Sefe bought 58 cargoes of Russian LNG from the French port of Dunkirk in 2024, six times more than in 2023, according to the report. Sefe was owned by Russia&#x2019;s Gazprom until the former&#x2019;s forced nationalization in 2022 and has a contract with Russia&#x2019;s Russia&#x2019;s Yamal LNG, owned by Russia&apos;s largest LNG producer and the country&apos;s second-largest natural gas producer, Novatek. Belgium, Spain, and France receive Russian LNG cargos, which they later reexport to other countries, the FT reported. This makes it difficult to trace the origin and allows Germany to import Russian LNG even after banning its ports from receiving Russian LNG shipments. The report underscores complications in the EU&apos;s effort to reduce the reliance on Russian fossil fuels. The EU cut all Russian coal imports, most Russian oil imports, and over two-thirds of Russian gas imports to the EU, a Commission spokesperson said earlier in January. The EU aims to eliminate all Russian fossil fuels from its market by 2027.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-buying-russian-lng/	2025-01-28T03:39:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2147892507.jpg
Russia pressuring relatives of Ukrainian POWs to collaborate, officials say	Russian intelligence services and military are attempting to influence relatives of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) by contacting them immediately after their capture, the Ukrainian Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of POWs reported on Jan. 27. The calls are used to pressure relatives into cooperating with Russian forces by demanding money, sensitive information, or illegal actions in exchange for promises of better treatment or inclusion in prisoner exchanges, according to the statement. &quot;This is done to shock, emotionally pressure, and force the family to cooperate,&quot; the headquarters reported. This comes as another example of Russia abusing or threatening Ukrainian captives as part of its all-out war against Ukraine. Kyiv and Moscow have carried out several prisoner exchanges during the conflict, though Russia has been accused of deliberately slowing down the swaps and spreading disinformation about the process to destabilize Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities have documented widespread violations of the Geneva Conventions by Russia, including the execution of over 100 Ukrainian POWs in 2024 alone, according to Ukrainian Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets. Reports of torture, murder, and ill-treatment of Ukrainian captives have surged in recent months, particularly in Donetsk Oblast, where intense fighting continues. On Jan. 23, Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office announced it was investigating a case of Russian troops summarily executing six Ukrainian POWs in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-pressure-relatives-of-ukrainian-pows-to-cooperate-ukrainian-officials-report/	2025-01-28T03:05:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2146012439.jpg
Large amount of Russian military gear reportedly evacuated from Syria's Tartus port	A &quot;large amount&quot; of Russian military equipment vanished from the Syrian port of Tartus with the departure of the Russian cargo ship Sparta II, an investigative journalist at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Mark Krutov, said on Jan. 27, citing satellite images. Another Russian cargo ship called Sparta remained docked in the port after the two ships idled for weeks off the coast before being granted permission to dock, the BBC reported. The news sheds further light on the state of Russian military assets in Syria, whose ultimate fate remains unclear after a rebel offensive overthrew Moscow-backed dictator Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. &quot;A large amount of Russian military equipment vanished from the Syrian port of Tartus with Sparta II&#x2019;s departure, while Sparta vessel remains in port,&quot; Krutov&#x2019;s post on X read. Both ships are owned by the sanctioned shipping company Oboronlogistics. Russia&#x2019;s Stroytransgaz&#x2019;s commitment made in 2019 to invest over $500 million in the modernization of the port, a prerequisite for allowing Russian ships into the port, was recently canceled.

The nearest loading area to the vessel has become densely packed with containers, as a @planet satellite image from Jan. 27 shows. pic.twitter.com/RHACg4ac3C Russia had a 49-year leasing right of the port, which had been agreed upon earlier by the Assad regime. After the dictator was overthrown and fled to Russia, Moscow began withdrawing military and naval assets from Syria. Russian soldiers and materiel began leaving the country mainly by planes, departing from another key Russian military base, the Khmeimim airport. This means that despite the impediments to maritime transport, most materiel is leaving the country via airlift, with only equipment impossible or expensive to lift by air being transported by sea, Russian military blogger Fighterbomber said in a Telegram post on Jan. 22. The BBC wrote that there were probably two more Russian warships in the port, the Ivan Gren and the Aleksandr Otrakovsky. This assessment was supported by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-evacuating-tartus/	2025-01-28T02:44:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192609037.jpg
Russian oligarch Abramovich evaded taxes through fake yacht hire scheme, media investigation says	Russian-Israeli oligarch Roman Abramovich evaded millions in taxes in EU countries through a fake yacht-for-hire scheme, according to a joint investigation by the BBC, The Guardian, and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism published on Jan. 28. The businessman acquired five yachts in the 2000s that he then &quot;hired&quot; for himself through controlled companies to claim an exemption from value-added tax (VAT) in Cyprus and elsewhere, the investigation said, citing leaked documents. Abramovich has a net worth estimated to be around $9 billion and has Russian, Israeli, and Portuguese citizenship. He was formerly the governor of the Chukotka region in Russia&apos;s far east and previously owned Chelsea FC, which he was forced to sell after the outbreak of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He and other top Russian oligarchs were sanctioned after the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The oligarch now resides alternatively in Tel Aviv, Istanbul, and Russia&apos;s Sochi. According to the investigation, Abramovich acquired the Eclipse, Ecstasea, Luna, Le Grand Bleu, and Pelorus superyachts shortly after getting rich from selling the Russian oil company Sibneft in 2005. The vessels, owned by various companies registered in the British Virgin Islands ultimately administered by Abramovich&apos;s trust, were registered as cargo, commercial, or passenger yachts and &quot;leased&quot; to the Cyprus-based company Blue Ocean Yacht Management. &#xA0; Blue Ocean then reportedly rented the yachts to other companies, which were, in fact, also controlled by Abramovich. This scheme helped the businessman generate profit without paying VAT. The oligarch&apos;s companies falsely claimed the right to tax exemption by listing the yachts as central to their business. According to experts consulted by the journalists, this may amount to tax evasion. Abramovich&apos;s lawyers denied any knowledge of a tax evasion scheme. The article came as part of the joint Cyprus Confidential investigation into files leaked in 2023 and led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and Paper Trail Media. Shortly after the outbreak of the full-scale invasion, Abramovich participated in peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. Bloomberg reported that he visited Kyiv as part of the talks in April 2022, which his spokesperson denied. Later in the year, Abramovich met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to help negotiate a prisoner exchange.	https://kyivindependent.com/abramovich-evaded-taxes-through-fake-yacht-hire-scheme-media-investigation-says/	2025-01-28T02:12:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-521573236.jpg
Stupid, illogical' — Zelensky blasts Ukraine for relinquishing nuclear arms without strong security guarantees	President Volodymyr Zelensky on Jan. 25 criticized Ukraine&apos;s decision to give up its nuclear weapons in the 1990s without receiving strong security guarantees in return. Ukraine relinquished the Soviet-era nuclear arms stationed on its territory under the Budapest Memorandum signed in 1994. The deal saw Kyiv join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and receive security guarantees from great powers, namely the U.S., the U.K., and Russia. &quot;In my opinion, it should not have been done, based on the fact that we were attacked,&quot; Zelensky said in an interview with the Italian newspaper Il Foglio released on Jan. 27. Twenty years after signing the agreement, Russia launched a war against Ukraine, occupying Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine. Thirty years in, Russia is now actively conducting a full-scale offensive against Ukraine. &quot;It was necessary to exchange (nuclear arms) for real security guarantees, and at the time, that was only NATO. And to be honest, today, it is only NATO,&quot; Zelensky said. The Ukrainian president commented that Ukraine agreed to give up on nuclear arms under pressure from &quot;larger economies&quot; like the U.S. and Russia. Despite this, Ukraine should have refused at the time, he added. &quot;If I were to exchange nuclear weapons, I would exchange them for something very strong that can actually stop any aggressor, regardless of its greatness, its territory, its army. And this would be a strong army and... a security bloc,&quot; Zelensky noted. &quot;Therefore, I believe that it was stupid, absolutely stupid, and illogical.&quot; This echoes Zelensky&apos;s comments from earlier this month when he said that those behind the agreement should be &quot;jailed.&quot; The outbreak of the full-scale invasion sparked discussions on whether Ukraine should again develop new nuclear weapons as a deterrent against Russian aggression. The Ukrainian leadership denied any such plans and said that NATO membership is the best possible security guarantee. Ukraine has applied to join NATO at the outbreak of the full-scale invasion in 2022 but is yet to receive an official invitation. Despite an allied pledge from last year that Kyiv&apos;s path toward membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; Zelensky pointed to continued resistance to Ukraine&apos;s entry from countries like the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia. As U.S. Donald Trump pushes for negotiations to end the war this year, Russia said that a full ban on Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession is one of its key demands for resolving the conflict.	https://kyivindependent.com/stupid-illogical-zelensky-blasts-ukraine-relinquishing-nuclear-arms-without-strong-security-guarantees/	2025-01-28T00:50:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1850432035.jpg
US suspends Ukrainian refugee program after Trump's immigration order	The U.S. has suspended its refugee program for Ukrainians called &quot;Uniting for Ukraine,&quot; the country&apos;s Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website showed on Jan. 28, more than a week after U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order on immigration and border security. &quot;Due to the Jan. 20, 2025, Executive Order, Securing Our Borders, USCIS is pausing acceptance of Form I-134A, Online Request to be a Supporter and Declaration of Financial Support, until we review all categorical parole processes as required by that order,&quot; the statement read. This means that new applications are effectively frozen until the completion of a review. The Uniting for Ukraine program allowed Ukrainians to stay in the U.S. for up to two years, work, and receive health insurance. The applicants were obligated to have a sponsor in the U.S. who would financially support them during their stay. As of last year, the U.S. had accepted over 200,000 Ukrainians under the program. Over 6 million Ukrainian citizens have fled their homes in the wake of Russia&apos;s all-out invasion in 2022. The decision was widely anticipated after the U.S. Homeland Security Department suspended several programs that allowed immigrants to temporarily settle in the country. According to a directive seen by the New York Times, this included an initiative for Ukrainians. The order called for an immediate halt to &quot;final decisions&quot; on applications related to these programs while the administration reviewed them and decided whether to terminate them. This decision will block the entry of immigrants fleeing some of the most unstable places in the world, including Ukraine, Cuba, Haiti, and Venezuela, among others, according to the outlet. The Trump administration officials also said that Trump believes that many of these programs were &quot;never lawful to begin with.&quot; In a similar move, the U.S. State Department has suspended almost all foreign aid, including non-military assistance to Ukraine. The step threw Ukrainian NGOs, many reliant on U.S. support, into disarray, with some voicing concerns about their ability to survive the aid freeze.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-suspends-ukrainian-refugee-program-after-trumps-immigration-order/	2025-01-27T23:59:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1246719268.jpg

G7 ambassadors urge swift resolution of Defense Procurement Agency's leadership dispute	Ambassadors of the Group of Seven (G7) countries called for a swift resolution of the Defense Procurement Agency dispute and urged uninterrupted continuation of weapons procurement, according to their statement on Jan. 27. This comes after Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Jan. 24 that he would not renew the contract of Maryna Bezrukova, the head of the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA), the body in charge of buying weapons for the Ukrainian military. He cited unsatisfactory results as the reason. Umerov&#x2019;s decision was just days after the DPA&#x2019;s supervisory board voted to extend the contract with Bezrukova after a year of reforming in this role. The ambassadors also emphasized the importance of adhering to governance standards. &quot;Consistency with good governance principles and NATO recommendations is important to maintain the trust of the public and international partners,&quot; they said in a statement on X. Umerov had earlier criticized the DPA under Bezrukova&#x2019;s leadership, claiming that arms procurement had &quot;turned into an Amazon.&quot; Bezrukova told the Kyiv Independent that she would not leave the agency as she was legally selected by the DPA&#x2019;s supervisory board. &#x201C;I&apos;m not going to surrender. I will stand in my position until the end,&#x201D; she said. She also pointed out that procurement for Ukrainian forces could be blocked due to the ongoing conflict. &quot;Contracting and supplies may be blocked because we are in a legal conflict. I cannot perform my duties now because of certain registration procedures,&quot; Bezrukova told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Bezrukova added that it is difficult to predict the consequences of the minister&apos;s decision and called the situation &quot;a serious reputational loss&quot; that could negatively affect relations with Ukraine&apos;s foreign partners. Umerov plans to replace Bezrukova with Arsen Zhumadilov, the director of the State Rear Operator (known under its Ukrainian acronym DOT) which buys food and clothes for the military.	https://kyivindependent.com/g7-ambassadors-urge-swift-resolution-of-defense-procurement-agencys-leadership-dispute/	2025-01-27T21:58:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1648100666-1.webp
Justice Ministry seeks to confiscate Russian oil company Tatneft's assets in Ukraine	The Justice Ministry has requested the Supreme Anti-Corruption Court to confiscate the assets of the Russian oil company Tatneft in Ukraine, Deputy Minister Iryna Bogatyk announced on Jan. 27. Tatneft is valued at approximately 2 billion hryvnia ($47 million). The assets targeted for nationalization include corporate rights, gas stations, oil depots, vehicles, and equipment located in the Kharkiv and Poltava Oblasts. The oil company is Russian state-controlled and significantly contributes to the country&apos;s budget. Tatneft regularly supplies products to enterprises within the Russian military-industrial complex. &#x201C;It (Tatneft) is part of the structure of the fuel and energy complex of the Russian Federation and produces about 20 types of products, including aviation kerosene and diesel fuel, which are included in the mandatory list of recommended supply to enterprises of the military-industrial complex of Russia,&#x201D; Bogatyk wrote on Facebook. The Ministry of Justice has also filed lawsuits to confiscate the sanctioned assets of three Ukrainians, including properties, vehicles, and corporate shares belonging to Kyrylo Vyshynsky, Oleksandr Kuzmenko, and Vladimir Sergiyenko. Russia&#x2019;s oil industry has been critical to the country&#x2019;s war efforts. Fossil fuel exports remain a major revenue stream for the Kremlin&#x2019;s military operations.	https://kyivindependent.com/justice-ministry-seeks-to-confiscate-russian-oil-company-tatnefts-assets-in-ukraine/	2025-01-27T19:58:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1258888534.jpeg
Zelensky meets with Macron, European Council President Costa in Poland	President Volodymyr Zelensky held separate meetings with French President Emmanuel Macron as well as European Council President Antonio Costa on Jan. 27 in Krakow, Poland amid a visit to commemorate Holocaust Remembrance Day. During the session with top European officials, including Costa, Zelensky discussed a variety of topics, including additional sanctions as well as the supply of additional ammunition, the Presidential Office said. &quot;We need to continue putting pressure on (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, and sanctions are one of the truly powerful tools,&quot; Zelensky said. Earlier in the day, European Union foreign ministers approved the extension of sanctions against Russia for another six months. According to the read out of the meeting, the anticipated 16th EU sanctions package was &quot;one of the key topics of the meeting.&quot; The Council of the EU adopted on Dec. 16 its 15th package of sanctions against Russia, targeting the Russian shadow fleet of tankers and the military-industrial complex. In addition to sanctions, the leaders discussed the details of a new ammunition supply initiative, with additional informal meetings scheduled for Feb. 3. Later in the day, Zelensky met with Macron to discuss &quot;security cooperation&quot; amid anticipated peace negotiations in the coming months. Macron has reportedly spearheaded prospects of sending European peacekeeping forces to Ukraine, amid U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s commitment to &quot;end&quot; the war. No details were provided on the specifics of the discussions between Zelensky and Macron, although the Presidential Office read out notes that &quot;possible formats for security guarantees for Ukraine&quot; were discussed. Earlier in the day, Zelensky expressed to Costa and European officials the need for a &quot;just and lasting peace&quot; following peace negotiations, echoing previous statements on Europe&apos;s full participation in peace negotiation. &quot;We will stand with you for as long as it takes,&quot; Costa concluded. Russia has thus far opposed the presence of NATO peacekeepers in Ukraine, with Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova claiming on Jan. 24 that it could lead to &quot;uncontrolled escalation.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-with-macron-european-council-president-in-poland/	2025-01-27T17:54:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1254902059.jpg
Russia's Ryazan oil refinery suspends operations after drone strike, Reuters reports	The Ryazan Oil Refinery in Russia has suspended operations due to damage from Ukrainian drone attacks, Reuters reported on Jan. 27, citing two industry sources. Ukraine confirmed hitting the plant in an overnight drone strike on Jan. 24. Oil storage facilities caught fire during the attack, sources told Reuters. The strike damaged a railway loading track and a hydroeater unit, which removes impurities from refined products. &quot;The railway loading equipment has been damaged. There have been no railways loadings, they stopped oil processing,&quot; one source said. Another said the facility suspended all loadings since Jan. 24. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces (SOS) launched a joint attack against the refinery on Jan. 24. An SBU source told the Kyiv Independent that the strike caused fires at three oil depots and a workshop. Local residents reported another attack on the plant two nights later, circulating footage of explosions and fires at the site. The Kyiv Independent could not confirm whether the images depicted a new attack or the previous strike. The Ryazan Oil Refinery, one of Russia&apos;s largest, has the capacity to process 17 million metric tons of oil per year. According to Reuters, the facility accounted for nearly 5% of Russia&apos;s total refining in 2024. Kyiv considers oil refineries to be valid military targets, as profits from the fossil fuel industry fund Russia&apos;s war machine. Ukraine previously attacked the Ryazan refinery in May 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-ryazan-oil-refinery-suspends-operations-after-drone-strike-reuters-reports/	2025-01-27T15:33:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/ryazan.jpg
A farce' — Foreign Ministry condemns sham election in Belarus	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry condemned the recent presidential election in Belarus, calling the vote &quot;a farce&quot; in a statement issued Jan. 27. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko &quot;won&quot; a seventh consecutive term as president on Jan. 26 in a so-called election widely denounced as neither free nor fair by the international community. &quot;It is difficult to call such elections fair, transparent and democratic, in particular given the political repression in Belarus, which deprived voters of any alternative choice and turned the elections themselves into a one-man political show,&quot; the ministry&apos;s statement read. Elections under the repressive conditions of the Lukashenko regime &quot;cannot be legitimate,&quot; the ministry said. &quot;It is a farce.&quot; Lukashenko has ruled Belarus since 1994 and is Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s closest ally. The Belarusian leader competed for the presidency against regime-approved candidates Sergey Syrankov, who secured 3.21% of the vote, and Oleg Gaidukevich, who received 2%. Lukashenko was declared the winner with 86.82% of the vote, while 3.6% of ballots reportedly voted &quot;against all.&quot; Kaja Kallas, the EU&apos;s chief diplomat, called the vote &quot;a sham&quot; and &quot;an affront to democracy.&quot; Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said the election was nothing more than a &quot;special operation&quot; by the Russia-backed regime. Tsikhanouskaya contested the results of the country&apos;s 2020 election, sparking mass protests after Lukashenko declared victory despite evidence of widespread fraud. The government brutally repressed the demonstrations and detained thousands of political prisoners. The Foreign Ministry expressed solidarity with Belarusian opposition figures and encouraged them to continue to fight for an independent Belarus. &quot;We are convinced that a democratic and sovereign Belarus, in which the people, not one person, will determine the future, will be a factor of long-term stability in our region, and not an accomplice in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine,&quot; the ministry said.	https://kyivindependent.com/a-farce-foreign-ministry-condemns-sham-elections-in-belarus/	2025-01-27T14:22:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1257867913.jpg
Trump 'helped' persuade Hungary to unblock EU Russia sanctions, Polish FM claims	U.S. President Donald Trump may have helped persuade Hungary to lift its veto on the European Union&apos;s extension of sanctions against Russia, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said on Jan. 27, according to the Polish news outlet RMF 24. The EU foreign ministers approved a six-month extension of its sanctions against Russia on Jan. 27 after Hungary withdrew its veto. Sikorski believes Trump&apos;s recent threats of sanctions against Moscow played a role in Hungary&apos;s decision. &quot;I think that President Trump helped here,&quot; Sikorski said. The EU sanctions, imposed on Russia in response to the full-scale invasion of &#xA0;Ukraine, must be extended by unanimous vote every six months. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban blocked the extension in a surprise veto on Dec. 19 and said he would not reconsider extending the sanctions until Trump took office. Orban is a close ally of Trump, who hosted the Hungarian prime minister at his Florida residence on Dec. 9. During the first week of his second term as president, Trump threatened to impose sanctions and tariffs against Russia if Russian President Vladimir Putin does not agree to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. &quot;We can do it the easy way or the hard way,&quot; Trump said. Hungary also previously said it would not extend the sanctions until Ukraine resumes the transit of Russian gas through its territory. Ahead of the Jan. 27 vote, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Brussels had provided the &quot;requested guarantees&quot; on energy security. Orban, one of the most Kremlin-friendly leaders in the EU, has consistently obstructed and delayed sanctions against Russia and military support for Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-helped-persuade-hungary-to-unblock-eu-russia-sanctions-polish-fm-claims/	2025-01-27T13:51:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/sikorski.jpeg
If half the people go home tomorrow, Putin will kill us all' — Zelensky defends mobilization	President Volodymyr Zelensky defended Ukraine&apos;s mobilization efforts in an interview with &#xA0;the Italian news outlet Il Foglio on Jan. 25, saying that the quickest way to bring soldiers home was to mobilize enough servicemembers to force Russia to end the war. Ukraine has struggled with manpower issues throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. An updated mobilization law passed in April 2024 aimed to address these difficulties, simplifying the process for identifying eligible conscripts and introducing penalties for draft dodgers. Mobilization slowed last autumn despite the legislative reforms, leaving depleted front-line units to face Russia&apos;s eastern advance. &quot;(M)artial law, it provides for the mobilization of people, and all the resources that are in the country. Absolutely everyone,&quot; Zelensky said in a video of the interview published by the Presidential Office on Jan. 27. &quot;And that, unfortunately, is the challenge of this war, and why we need to maximize the speed to end it. To force Russia to end this war.&quot; Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 are barred from leaving the country under martial law, but only those over 25 are eligible for the draft. The government is currently finalizing reforms to recruit 18- to 25-year-olds, aiming to make voluntary enlistment more appealing to younger citizens. &quot;We are defending ourselves today,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;If tomorrow, for example, half of the army just goes home, then we should have surrendered on the first day. That&apos;s the way it is. Because if half the people go home tomorrow, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will kill us all.&quot; While Zelensky said the best way to bring soldiers home was to force Russia to end the war, he acknowledged that the Armed Forces require better policies on rotating and relieving personnel. &quot;They have rotations, or vacations. But certainly it is not enough,&quot; he said. &quot;Certainly we need to work on the quality of that.&quot; Russian forces significantly outnumber Ukrainian units in some parts of the front and have been able to gain territory in eastern Ukraine while absorbing heavy losses. Ukrainian authorities have faced criticism for aggressive forced mobilization tactics and for reportedly transferring skilled Air Force personnel into infantry units. At the same time, Zelensky has refused to lower the draft age to 18 despite increasing U.S. pressure to do so. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/if-half-the-people-go-home-tomorrow-putin-will-kill-us-all-zelensky-defends-mobilization/	2025-01-27T12:54:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Ze2.png
Ukraine war latest: North Korean forces reportedly pull back from one front-line sector following heavy casualties	Key developments on Jan. 27: North Korean soldiers appear to have temporarily withdrawn from one of the axes of the front in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, a Special Operations Forces (SOF) spokesperson told the Kyiv Independent on Jan. 27 as Pyongyang&#x2019;s troops reportedly suffered significant losses. The statement came after Sky News reported, citing a commander of a detachment of the 73rd Naval Special Operations Center with a callsign &quot;Puls,&quot; that North Korean troops have temporarily withdrawn from the contact line in the embattled Russian region. Colonel Oleksandr Kindratenko, a spokesperson of the Special Operations Forces, clarified to the Kyiv Independent that the North Korean troops appear to have had to temporarily withdraw only from one of the axes of Kursk Oblast where the 73rd SOF Center is deployed. North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in early August 2024. Ukrainian forces have continued fighting in the region, hoping to leverage their positions for potential negotiations. North Korean forces are taking respite from hostilities, presumably to treat the wounded, wait for reinforcements, and work on mistakes made during the fighting in this sector, according to Sky News. &quot;Puls&quot; assumed that this break will not last long and the North Korean military &quot;will be back soon.&quot; The soldier also noted North Korean troops&apos; high motivation and that they continued the offensive despite heavy losses. North Korean soldiers were unaware of the threats from drones and artillery and attacked on foot in large groups, &quot;like in World War II,&quot; becoming an easy target, &quot;Puls&quot; added. There is poor coordination and a language barrier between North Korean and Russian troops barrier that has already led to North Korean soldiers targeting Russian positions, according to the Ukrainian military. South Korean intelligence announced at the end of January that Pyongyang was planning to send more troops to Russia to participate in the war. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, also said previously that Pyongyang is preparing reinforcements, mainly gun and rocket artillery units. The New York Times reported that according to an undisclosed U.S. official, fresh North Korean troops could arrive within two months. Russia&#x2019;s Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 26 that its forces had captured Velyka Novosilka, a strategically significant settlement in the western part of Donetsk Oblast. Ukraine&#x2019;s 110th Mechanized Brigade, which is deployed in the area, acknowledged a withdrawal from parts of the village to avoid encirclement but claimed that fighting is ongoing elsewhere in Velyka Novosilka. &quot;Fights in Velyka Novosilka are ongoing. Russian forces shelled our positions 30 times,&quot; the Khortytsia group of forces said on Jan. 27. &quot;The Defense Forces continue inflicting casualties on Russia in manpower and equipment during tense battles.&quot; The group&#x2019;s spokesperson, Viktor Trehubov, clarified later during the day that Ukrainian forces withdrew from the southern part of the village but continue to hold positions in the outskirts. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The village with a pre-war population of 5,000 lies only around 15 kilometers from the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast and 20 kilometers from Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a region so far untouched by Russian occupation.

(DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)If confirmed, this would represent the most significant gain of Russian forces in Donetsk Oblast since overrunning Kurakhove earlier in January. The 110th Brigade said that both Russia and Ukraine had parity in equipment but Moscow had significant advantage in manpower. According to the Ukrainian military, Russian forces will struggle to advance their offensive onward. The Mokri Yaly River creates an obstacle for Russia&#x2019;s advance and Russian troops are in a vulnerable &quot;fire pocket,&quot; said the brigade. Fighting is at a very heavy level in Donetsk Oblast and Russian troops continue to advance, albeit slowly, this year. &#x200B;&#x200B;Throughout the fall of 2024, Russian forces made operational gains in southern Donetsk Oblast, including areas near Toretsk and Chasiv Yar, while advancing near Kupiansk and on Russian soil in Kursk Oblast. Russian forces have intensified their assaults near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, deploying small groups in an attempt to encircle Ukrainian troops, Victor Trehubov, spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces, said on Jan. 27 on national television. &quot;For the first time, they started to fight smart; for the first time, they started to fight not just with direct human waves, but with attempts to cover, with attempts to bypass a large city and force Ukrainian forces to leave it,&quot; Trehubov said. The area near Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub for Ukrainian forces, has been at the center of heavy fighting for months. &quot;The situation is as follows: there is a large number of small-scale clashes near Pokrovsk because Russians are trying to enter and surround Pokrovsk from the west in small groups. There are many, many clashes there,&quot; Trehubov said. The estimated Russian advance in the Pokrovsk sector in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 27, 2025, according to DeepState map. A white symbol marks Pokrovsk. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Pokrovsk remains the focal point of Russia&apos;s eastern offensive, now in its fifth month. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported that Russian troops are continuing to push on multiple axes, including Lyman, Siversk, Kramatorsk, Toretsk, and Kurakhove. Trehubov said the Russian command is avoiding urban battles to reduce heavy personnel losses. Despite these efforts, Moscow has so far failed to outflank Pokrovsk and sever its logistics routes. President Volodymyr Zelensky appointed Major General Mykhailo Drapatyi, Commander of the Ground Forces of Ukraine, as the head of the Khortytsia operational-strategic Group on Jan. 26. &quot;Today, I ordered a strengthening of the command structure of our forces in the Donetsk Oblast,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address. He noted that Drapatyi&#x2019;s leadership will focus on the most intense combat areas while also ensuring proper training for brigades. Drapatyi will continue in his role as Commander of the Ground Forces, the largest component of the Armed Forces. Zelensky appointed Drapatyi as commander in November 2024. Drapatyi served as a commander of Ukraine&apos;s 58th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade from 2016 to 2019. He also played one of the key roles in the liberation of Mariupol in Donetsk Oblast in 2014. Additionally, Brigadier General Andrii Hnatov has been appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff to improve coordination between operational headquarters and the front lines. Previously, Hnatov served as Commander of the Joint Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Zelensky appointed him to that role in June 2024. Zelensky said that these and other changes were discussed with Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi to address key military tasks at all levels. &#x201C;The specific needs of the front must determine the standards for equipping and training brigades,&#x201D; Zelensky said. Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence (HUR) denied on Jan. 27 media reports that its head, Kyrylo Budanov, predicted serious consequences for the existence of Ukraine unless negotiations begin by the summer during a confidential parliamentary meeting. Although HUR&#x2019;s statement did not specify the alleged quote, an assessment attributed to Budanov began circulating in the Ukrainian media earlier on Jan. 27. &quot;If there are no serious negotiations by the summer, then very dangerous processes for the very existence of Ukraine may begin,&quot; an undisclosed source told Ukrainska Pravda, referring to an alleged statement by Budanov during a closed-door parliamentary meeting. &quot;The Ukrainian military intelligence would like to draw the attention&#x2026; to the fact that the alleged quote of (Budanov)... from a closed, classified session of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine&#x2026; is not true,&quot; HUR&#x2019;s statement read. Ukrainska Pravda did not specify what processes the military spy chief was said to have in mind. In office since 2020, Budanov has at time made radical predictions about the full-scale war that have not always come true. Opposition lawmaker Oleksii Honcharenko also disputed Ukrainska Pravda&#x2019;s article, saying the spy chief did not warn of threats to Ukraine&#x2019;s very existence. &quot;(Budanov) said that if nothing changes, the front line may begin to collapse and there will be problems,&quot; Honcharenko said on his Telegram channel. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The news comes amid growing expectation of peace talks as U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table. Short on manpower, Kyiv will soon begin the fourth year of the full-scale war on its back foot, with Russia holding or pushing the front line on key directions such as the southwestern edge of Donetsk Oblast or Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. Trump&#x2019;s special peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, said the U.S. aims to end the war in the first 100 days of Trump&#x2019;s presidency. European Union foreign ministers approved the extension of sanctions against Russia for another six months on Jan. 27, the EU&#x2019;s chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, announced on X. &quot;Europe delivers: EU foreign ministers just agreed to extend again the sanctions on Russia. This will continue to deprive Moscow of revenues to finance its war. Russia needs to pay for the damage they are causing,&quot; Kallas wrote on X. Hungary&#x2019;s Prime Minister Viktor Orban has threatened to veto the extension until Ukraine resumes the transit of Russian gas through its territory. The announcement by Kallas comes after Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Brussels had provided the &quot;requested guarantees&quot; on energy security. &quot;The European Commission is committed to protecting natural gas and oil pipelines leading to European Union member states,&quot; the Hungarian chief diplomat said, adding that the European Commission will also ask Kyiv to maintain the oil transit through its territory. Ukraine terminated Russian natural gas transit through its territory on Jan. 1. Kyiv has repeatedly warned that it would not extend the agreement when it expires at the end of 2024 because it did not want to finance Russia&apos;s war. The end of transit led to a spat between Kyiv on one side and Hungary and Slovakia on the other, with the two latter countries complaining the decision endangers their energy security. Ukraine continues to transit Russian oil, though a bill on banning the transit has been registered in the parliament. The EU has imposed 15 sanctions packages against Russia, which include restrictions on individuals and legal entities. The limitations also targeted Russia&#x2019;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of oil tankers and froze Russian assets, among other moves. In January, the European Commission launched consultations on the 16th package of sanctions against Russia. The restrictions are expected to apply to imports of aluminum, agricultural products, the &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; liquefied natural gas (LNG), and Russian banks, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-north-korean-troops-seem-to-temporarily-withdraw-from-one-section-of-front-in-kursk-oblast-military-says/	2025-01-27T12:25:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029588238--1-.jpg
Trump suspends aid to Ukraine, vital NGOs 'don't know if they'll survive'	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s decision to freeze foreign development assistance for 90 days has thrown Ukrainian organizations into turmoil, in some cases threatening their very existence and leaving the people they support in limbo. These non-profit organizations provide a huge range of humanitarian services, including counseling, organizing cultural events, and providing basic services, often to some of the most vulnerable segments of society. &quot;Honestly, we still don&#x2019;t fully understand the scope of the impact this decision will have on the civic sector and everyone affected,&quot; Olha Kucher, head of the services department at Veteran Hub, an NGO that supports Ukrainian soldiers, war veterans, and their families, told the Kyiv Independent on Jan 27. &quot;The civic sector plays a massive role in supporting veterans and their families, particularly through psychosocial services, as we do.&quot; One of Trump&apos;s first actions upon entering the White House was to sign an executive order freezing foreign development assistance for 90 days to conduct a review and ensure it aligns with the new administration&apos;s policies. The wording of the executive order was broad, making no distinction between humanitarian and military aid, and no mention of any exemptions. Veteran Hub, an NGO supporting Ukrainian soldiers, war veterans, and their families in Kyiv, Ukraine. (Veteran Hub / Facebook)Ukrainian Veterans at Veteran Hub, an NGO supporting Ukrainian soldiers, war veterans, and their families in Kyiv, Ukraine. (Veteran Hub / Facebook)The Pentagon clarified on Jan. 23 that relating to Ukraine, the directive &quot;only applies to development programs, not military support.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 25 that the U.S. aid had not stopped flowing to Ukraine. But any relief that crucial U.S. weapons would still be sent to Ukraine was tempered by the prospect of a pause in humanitarian aid. This was compounded a day later when U.S. State Secretary Marco Rubio issued &quot;stop-work orders&quot; on nearly all existing foreign assistance grants. The orders were effective immediately. &quot;State just totally went nuclear on foreign assistance,&quot; one unnamed State Department official told Politico. As a result, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) was ordered to stop projects in Ukraine. Affected organizations were notified of the decision on the morning of Jan. 25. Ukraine currently tops the recipient list of U.S. development assistance as it continues to face Russia&#x2019;s war, official data shows. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, USAID has provided Ukraine with $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support. At a stroke, organizations in Ukraine have been left in dire financial straits. One of them is &#x201C;Cukr,&#x201D; an NGO and media outlet based in Sumy, a city in northeastern Ukraine located just 30 kilometers from the Russian border that has been heavily affected by the war. &quot;If we lose all of our U.S. funding, we won&#x2019;t last 90 days without additional support,&quot; Dmytro Tishchenko, Cukr co-founder, told the Kyiv Independent. As well as being a media channel, Cukr (which means &#x201C;sugar&#x201D; in Ukrainian, with a tweak) organizes concerts and festivals, and also provides educational workshops on business and mental health, badly-needed resources for those living in a region that is one of the hardest hit by daily Russian missile, glide bomb, and drone attacks. Magazines of &#x201C;Cukr,&#x201D; an NGO and media outlet based in Sumy, a northeastern Ukrainian city situated just 30 kilometers from the Russian border, which has been severely impacted by the war. (Cukr / Facebook)Tishchenko said 30% of the organization&apos;s funding was currently frozen and all planned events tied to that money had been canceled. &quot;Even if we try to use alternative resources for these projects, we&#x2019;ll need to rethink how to implement them,&quot; he said. Valerii Garmash, head of &quot;Makes Sense,&quot; an NGO dedicated to developing independent journalism in Ukraine, told the Kyiv Independent that the USAID freeze, even if lifted after 90 days, threatens the survival of her organization and others like it. &quot;A large number of organizations will simply cease to exist, they don&#x2019;t know how they are supposed to survive.&quot; she said, adding: &quot;Great organizations, valuable organizations, important organizations. But they really could, and theoretically might, just stop existing.&quot; Garmash said the USAID freeze will have an &quot;enormous impact&quot; on the work of Makes Sense, potentially threatening a hub it operates in Sloviansk, a city in embattled Donetsk Oblast, that supports journalists heading to report from the front lines. &quot;It would mean we simply wouldn&#x2019;t be able to support them, provide them with bulletproof vests, helmets, medical kits, give them a place to work, charge their equipment, or even just have coffee in a warm space,&quot; she said. As well as the precarious financial situation now facing the NGOs, individuals working from them have lost their jobs, at least temporarily. The head of a regional office for a State Department-funded organization in Ukraine spoke with the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity due to the fear of retaliation for speaking out. He said that the organization has projects funded by USAID that involve Ukrainian contractors. Due to the freeze, they will lose income from these projects. &quot;I explained the situation to them, and, you know, they&apos;re part-time contractors, this might not be their only livelihood, but for some people, it will be,&quot; he said.

(Volodymyr Tarasov / Ukrinform / Getty Images)&quot;Three months can be a very long time, and if they can&apos;t pay their rent, or something like that, that&apos;s the situation that these people can be in,&quot; he added. Hopes had been raised that Ukraine could be made exempt from the USAID freeze on Jan. 25, when the Financial Times (FT) reported that senior diplomats in the State Department&#x2019;s Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs requested a full waiver for operations in Ukraine, citing national security concerns. This had gone unheeded a day later when a U.S. State Department press release said Rubio had &quot;paused all U.S. foreign assistance funded by or through the State Department and USAID for review.&quot; But an American working for a State Department-funded organization in Ukraine told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity that the waiver could still be being processed. &quot;It&apos;s unlikely that they would have received an answer by now. I mean, it&apos;s only Monday,&quot; they said, adding &quot;I don&apos;t think any waivers would have been processed in time. It&apos;s possible that a waiver for Ukraine could still happen.&quot; The Kyiv Independent contacted USAID about the status of the waiver request but had not received a reply at the time of publication. In any case, until either the 90 days are up and USAID assistance resumes or the waiver request is approved, some of the most vulnerable people in Ukraine will be left without crucial support. Kucher, head of the services department at Veterans Hub, says that as well as providing in-person counseling and support to veterans, the organization&#x2019;s 24-hour support hotline handles 1,300 calls a month. &quot;For veterans and their families, knowing that there&#x2019;s someone they can rely on at any time is critical,&quot; she said. &quot;Any change, especially in uncertain times like these, is challenging for everyone. It&#x2019;s unpredictable and unsettling.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-suspends-aid-to-ukraine-vital-ngos-dont-know-if-theyll-survive/	2025-01-27T11:51:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194418223.jpg
Russia approves conscription reforms to target draft evaders, streamline recruitment	The Russian government has approved new measures to streamline the conscription process, making it easier to draft young men into the Armed Forces, including those who previously evaded service, The Moscow Times reported on Jan. 27. The reforms, according to Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kartapolov, aim to &quot;qualitatively improve the level of organization of conscription.&quot; Under the new legislation, draft board decisions for individuals deemed fit for service will remain valid for one year. This allows military commissions to send individuals to the army in subsequent drafts without requiring additional medical examinations or decisions. For instance, if a person was found fit but did not enter service due to illness or other reasons, they can be drafted directly during the next conscription campaign. In Russia, conscription campaigns are held twice a year, in spring and fall, targeting men aged 18 to 27. These campaigns form the core of Russia&apos;s conscription-based military system, drafting hundreds of thousands annually. The bill also consolidates the organization of draft commissions, mandating only one commission in cities of federal significance or two in larger municipalities. These changes follow Russia&apos;s recent conscription campaigns, during which record numbers were drafted. In the fall 2024 draft, 133,000 individuals were conscripted, and 150,000 were recruited during the spring campaign, a record for the past eight years. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed decrees specifying the number of recruits required during each period. The push to expand military manpower comes as Russia faces severe losses in its war against Ukraine. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 27 that Russia has lost 831,620 troops since launching its full-scale invasion. While Russian conscripts rarely take part in active combat, Russia has been actively recruiting civilians to take part in the country&apos;s war against Ukraine by offering financial incentives, pardoning crimes, or simply taking people from the streets. Yet, after the highly unpopular September 2022 mobilization led to over 261,000 Russians fleeing the country, Putin has avoided a second wave of mobilization, opting for alternative methods to bolster troop numbers.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-introduces-reforms-to-streamline-military-conscription-media-reports/	2025-01-27T11:36:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1253226504.jpg
After Lukashenko's latest sham election win, exiled Belarusians reflect on lessons learned from 2020's lost revolution	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko declared himself the winner in the country&apos;s so-called presidential elections, in which zero members of the country&apos;s opposition were allowed to take part. According to the country&apos;s authorities, Lukashenko secured 86.82% of the vote and became president for the seventh consecutive time. Despite international condemnation and widespread opposition among Belarusians, Lukashenko&apos;s regime has only tightened its control since the last election. Relentless crackdowns on dissent, including mass arrests, imprisonment, and torture, have been ongoing in the country for nearly five years. &quot;Anyone following the situation knows it&apos;s a sham election, and for us, Lukashenko has been wholly illegitimate since 2020,&quot; Hanna Komar, a Belarusian author who has been living in exile for the past five years, told the Kyiv Independent. Exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, widely recognized by election observers as the rightful winner of the 2020 presidential election, publicly condemned the latest so-called vote. &quot;Lukashenko, propped up by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, holds nine million Belarusians hostage, drags us into war, and betrays our sovereignty. We will never accept him. He does not represent Belarus. The regime must end its repressions, release political prisoners, and be held accountable for its crimes,&quot; Tsikhanouskaya wrote on Jan. 26. Russian President Vladimir Putin meets with Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko at the Kremlin in Moscow on April 5, 2023. (Pavel Byrkin / Sputnik / AFP via Getty Images)For the more than 500,000 Belarusians who have fled the country since 2020, Lukashenko&apos;s latest &quot;victory&quot; serves as a painful reminder of the democratic future they fought for and ultimately failed to secure. Yet, even in the face of despair, many try to remain hopeful, using the hard-earned lessons of that tumultuous period to strengthen their exile community and continue working toward a future democratic Belarus that they still dream of having. The 2020 presidential election in Belarus was defined by Tsikhanouskaya&apos;s bold challenge to Alexander Lukashenko&apos;s decades-long rule. By contrast, the latest so-called election lacked any real opposition, featuring three candidates from pro-government parties and one candidate seen as a figurehead. In the months leading up to Jan. 26, Lukashenko staged an orchestrated spectacle by pardoning and releasing dozens of political prisoners. Lukashenko framed the move as an act of goodwill toward those who had &quot;gone astray.&quot; However, these individuals had been imprisoned solely for exercising their democratic rights and taking part in the protests against Lukashenko&apos;s regime that began in May 2020. As of December 2024, at least 1,265 political prisoners are known to be held in Belarusian prisons, according to the Belarusian human rights organization Viasna. In December alone, up to 150 politically motivated sentences were handed down, with Belarusians consistently denied the right to a fair trial. &quot;I think Lukashenko understands that Russia is waiting for the right moment to replace him. He&apos;s deeply afraid of this and is now trying to play some kind of strange game with the West. He released some political prisoners to garner a &apos;favorable&apos; image, but at the same time, he hasn&apos;t stopped the repressions. It&apos;s endless,&quot; Kseniya Halubovich, an exiled film director and journalist, told the Kyiv Independent. Komar was among those detained during the 2020 protests, having attended a rally organized in solidarity with opposition leader Maria Kalesnikava, who had been arrested just days prior.

(STRINGER / AFP via Getty Images)The rally escalated when the women protesters tried to prevent the police from arresting the men. Komar spent nine days in jail and, by her own account, considers herself lucky to have been released. &quot;It was still a relatively mild phase of the political crackdowns back then. I am one of over 50,000 Belarusians who have endured detentions and imprisonment,&quot; Komar said. &quot;Since then, repression (against pro-democracy Belarusians) has only intensified. Every day, hundreds of people lose their jobs, face home searches, are summoned for interrogations, or are sentenced to days, weeks, months, and even years in prison. The punishment machine has not ceased for a single day since the summer of 2020.&quot; Opposition leader Kalesnikava has been behind bars for over four years, as are those who attempted to challenge Lukahsenko on the ballot in 2020, including Viktar Babaryka and Siarhei Tsikhanouski. &#x201C;Prison is for people who have opened their mouths too wide and who have broken the law. Don&apos;t you have prisons in Britain and America?&#x201D; Lukashenko countered when asked about jailed opposition figures in a recent interview with the BBC. Reflecting on the days immediately following the 2020 election, Halubovich recalls the pervasive sense of fear that hung in the air. On the night following the election, as she and others waited outside her school for election results, some panicked and fled at the sight of the police. An internet shutdown made it difficult to communicate properly, get news, or coordinate &#x2014; not to mention get news of what was happening to the outside world. &quot;&#x200B;&#x200B;The &apos;point of no return&apos; for me came the night when the police released some of those who had been arrested and tortured in the first days,&quot; Halubovich said. &quot;I spent the entire night outside Akrestina prison &#x2014; the most terrifying place in Belarus &#x2014; where people were released by morning, horribly beaten. Some of them were too afraid to even sit in an ambulance, it was like they were half-mad after being tortured.&quot; After several weeks, the protests began to lose their momentum. From every march she attended beginning in September 2020, Komar recalled beginning to sense a lack of clear strategy among the movement and felt that it was often unclear what the right course of action should be.

(Petras Malukas / AFP via Getty Images)&quot;Still, I kept joining the marches and protests until early 2021. It was simply the need to keep going &#x2014; because to stop would have meant letting down all the people still behind bars in Belarus,&quot; Komar said. &quot;I remember one of the final neighborhood marches, feeling exhausted and desperate, but thinking of Mikita Zalatarou, the 17-year-old political prisoner with epilepsy who was tortured in prison. The drive to do something to free him became my only fuel.&quot; The regime&apos;s relentless brutality against those who opposed Lukashenko highlights the immense challenges the movement faced from the onset. &quot;Unfortunately, we weren&apos;t ready to seize the opportunities that briefly arose during the moment of disarray among (those in power),&quot; Alina Rudina, a Belarusian journalist now living in Ukraine, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Never again can we underestimate the enemy&apos;s cruelty and what they are willing to do to maintain their power.&quot; Over 30 years into his reign, Lukashenko seems poised to remain in power for the foreseeable future, but many of the Belarusians who took part in the 2020 protests hesitate to look back on that period as a total defeat. For pro-democracy Belarusians, the events of 2020 were largely a moment of national awakening &#x2014; one that reignited a sense of independence, rekindled pride in their language and history, and fortified their resolve to break free from Russia&apos;s influence over their country. Under Lukashenko&apos;s rule over the past three decades, Russia&apos;s cultural and political reach remained entrenched in Belarusian society. However, the ongoing crisis has provided Belarusians in exile with an opportunity to assert the distinctiveness of their language and culture, challenging years of Russification and reaffirming their national identity. &quot;My sense of identity is more Belarusian now than it was before 2020. I make a conscious effort to avoid reading or watching anything Russian, and I&apos;m grateful that my mind feels so clear and free from that imperialistic influence,&quot; Halubovich said. For those Belarusians who have sought refuge in wartime Ukraine, this choice of language holds even greater significance. Rudina, who has lived in Ukraine for nearly five years, finds that her new home has helped to foster an environment that has allowed her to rediscover the Belarusian language, which she now uses daily in both her personal and professional life.

Thank you for taking the time to read this article. The Belarusian people&apos;s ongoing struggle for a better future is both courageous and inspiring. Despite bravely facing Lukashenko&apos;s harsh authoritarian regime, their efforts receive far too little attention. They deserve greater recognition and our unwavering support.

Russia introduces history textbook that redefines war against Ukraine as justified defense	Military History of Russia, a new textbook introduced in Moscow on Jan. 27, frames the war in Ukraine as a continuation of the Soviet battle against Nazi Germany, portraying the invasion as a necessary reaction to Western threats, Reuters reported. The three-volume textbook, targeted at schoolchildren, claims Russia was &quot;forced&quot; to invade Ukraine in 2022, citing long-standing grievances such as NATO&apos;s eastward expansion and the 2014 ousting of Ukraine&apos;s pro-Russian president, which the textbook characterizes as a Western-backed coup. Edited by Vladimir Medinsky, a presidential advisor and architect of Kremlin propaganda, the textbook aligns with the Russian government&apos;s narrative about the war. The book describes Ukraine as an &quot;aggressive anti-Russian bridgehead&quot; and emphasizes battlefield heroism while drawing parallels between modern Russian military tactics and those employed by the Soviet army during World War II. This publication is part of a broader Kremlin effort to reshape public perception through education. In 2023, Russia&apos;s Education Ministry updated school history textbooks to include sections on the war in Ukraine &#x2014; referred to as a &quot;special military operation&quot; &#x2014; the annexation of Crimea and the impact of Western sanctions. Russia&apos;s Education Ministry initiative, Conversations about Important Things, launched in 2022, promotes themes like patriotism, traditional family values, and Russian nuclear security to students as young as six. The program includes video lessons featuring figures such as Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Patriarch Kirill. The Kremlin&apos;s intensified focus on historical revisionism and ideological education reflects its attempt to solidify domestic support for the war, casting Russia as a defender of sovereignty against a hostile and &quot;decadent&quot; West. Critics argue these measures are an apparent effort to indoctrinate young Russians and justify the ongoing war to future generations.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-introduces-history-textbook-that-redefines-ukraine-war-as-justified-defense/	2025-01-27T10:42:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1243621433-3.jpg
EU agrees to ease sanctions on Syria following Assad's fall, chief diplomat says	The European Union&apos;s foreign ministers reached a political agreement on Jan. 27 to ease sanctions on Syria following the collapse of dictator Bashar al-Assad&apos;s regime. The move comes as opposition forces captured Damascus on Dec. 8 in a rapid offensive, toppling Assad after 24 years in power. &quot;While we aim to move fast, the lifting of sanctions can be reversed if wrong steps are taken,&quot; EU chief diplomat Kaja Kallas posted on X, adding that the EU plans to scale up humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts in Syria. The agreement may include lifting energy and transportation-related sanctions, though restrictions on financial transactions remain under discussion, Reuters reported on Jan. 26. The policy shift reflects growing support within the EU for cooperating with Syria&apos;s new leadership. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron previously expressed their readiness to work with the rebel forces that ousted Assad. Syria has also taken steps to distance itself from Russia. The port of Tartus recently terminated a 49-year investment deal with Russian construction company Stroytransgaz. Ukraine has also engaged with Syria&apos;s new leadership. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha visited Damascus on Dec. 30 to discuss Russia&apos;s military presence in Syria. Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi noted that Kyiv and Syria share similar views on the issue, though specific details were not disclosed.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-agrees-to-ease-sanctions-on-syria-after-assads-regime-falls-chief-diplomat-says/	2025-01-27T10:38:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188252219.jpg
Lithuania, Estonia pledge 5% defense spending, following Trump's call, FT reports	Lithuania and Estonia have become the first NATO members to meet U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s call to raise defense spending to more than 5% of GDP, Financial Times reported on Jan. 27. Trump reiterated his demand on Jan. 7, urging NATO allies to increase their defense contributions beyond the current 2% benchmark, citing the need for Europe to take greater responsibility for its security amid Russia&apos;s ongoing full-scale war in Ukraine. Lithuania&apos;s Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys, reportedly described the shift as part of a &quot;new era,&quot; with Vilnius committing to spending between 5% and 6% of its GDP on defense annually until at least 2030. Estonia followed suit, with Prime Minister Kristen Michal pledging to raise defense spending from 3.7% of GDP to 5%. This would put the Baltic nations well ahead of most NATO members and even the United States, which allocated 3.38% of its GDP to defense in 2024. In July, Poland&apos;s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said his country would spend 5% of its GDP on defense in 2025, becoming the first NATO country to do so. The announcements come as NATO members debate raising the alliance-wide defense spending target to 3% of GDP by 2030, still below Trump&apos;s proposed 5% benchmark. While 24 member states met the current 2% target in 2024, several, including Italy, Canada, and Spain, remain below this threshold. Poland led NATO in defense spending last year, allocating 4.12% of GDP, followed by Estonia and the U.S. Trump&apos;s pressure on NATO allies to increase defense budgets reflects his long-standing criticism of what he perceives as Europe&apos;s reliance on American security guarantees. His remarks in February 2024 &#x2014; threatening to let Russia &quot;do whatever the hell they want&quot; to NATO members failing to meet spending criteria &#x2014; sparked international outrage, raising concerns about his commitment to the alliance&apos;s collective defense principle.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-estonia-pledge-5-defense-spending-following-trumps-call-ft-reports/	2025-01-27T09:22:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179841418.jpg
EU suspends visa privileges for Georgian officials over democratic backsliding	The European Union suspended parts of its visa facilitation agreement with Georgia on Jan. 27, citing concerns over the country&apos;s democratic backsliding. &quot;Fundamental rights and democratic values are core principles of EU integration. Officials that represent a country which trample down these values should not benefit from easier access to the EU,&quot; said Tomasz Siemoniak, Poland&apos;s interior minister. The decision follows mass protests in Tbilisi over parliamentary elections that the opposition belives were nor free nor fair and a political crisis sparked by Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze&apos;s announcement that Georgia&apos;s EU integration could be delayed until 2028. The suspension applies to members of Georgian official delegations, government and parliamentary officials, Constitutional and Supreme Court judges, and holders of diplomatic passports. Ordinary Georgian citizens will retain visa-free travel to the EU for short-term trips. The ruling Georgian Dream party, founded by oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, has drawn criticism for steering Georgia closer to Russia while hindering its EU accession. A controversial foreign agents law adopted earlier in 2024 led the EU to freeze Georgia&apos;s membership process effectively, while a package of anti-LGBTQ laws further exacerbated the crisis.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-suspends-visa-privileges-for-georgian-officials-over-democratic-backsliding/	2025-01-27T09:06:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1250058338.jpg
Procurement for Ukrainian forces may be blocked due to legal conflict, Defense Procurement Agency's head says	The acquisition of ammunition through the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) may be blocked due to a legal conflict, Maryna Bezrukova, the head of the agency, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. On Jan. 23, the DPA&apos;s supervisory board unanimously voted to extend Bezrukova&apos;s contract for another year. Yet, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov overruled the board&apos;s decision on Jan. 24, saying that he would not renew Bezrukova&apos;s contract as head of the DPA. He cited allegedly unsatisfactory results as the reason and appointed Rustem Zhmadilov, who also manages the State Logistics Operator (DOT). Following Umerov&apos;s move, DPA declared that it continues to operate under Bezrukova&apos;s leadership. &quot;Contracting and supplies may be blocked because we are in a legal conflict. I cannot perform my duties now because of certain registration procedures,&quot; Bezrukova told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. &quot;The newly appointed interim acting director is also unlikely to be able to perform his duties, as his appointment contradicts the law, the charter, and in general, we actually have a legal block. I do not know why this was done; it is a very strange situation.&quot; Bezrukova added that it is difficult to predict the consequences of the minister&apos;s decision and called the situation &quot;a serious reputational loss&quot; that could negatively affect relations with Ukraine&apos;s foreign partners. &quot;My only concern is how to get out of it properly and how we can bring it back to the right legal framework not to stop the contracting and supply processes, not to jeopardize my actions as the head of the agency,&quot; she said. Bezrukova also noted that Umerov publicly supported her at staff meetings and did not express any complaints about her work&apos;s quality. According to Ukrainian law, supervisory boards have the authority to hire and fire the heads of state enterprises unilaterally. This means that legally, after the board&apos;s vote, Bezrukova should take over the Defense Procurement Agency for another year. However, due to amendments recently made to the agency&apos;s charter by the Defense Ministry, which oversees the DPA, the ministry can reverse the supervisory board&apos;s decisions. Anti-corruption activists and lawmakers say that the amendments and Umerov&#x2019;s decision are &quot;unlawful.&quot; Following Umerov&apos;s move, the Anti-Corruption Action Center filed a complaint with the country&apos;s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) to open an investigation against Umerov on suspicion of alleged abuse of power. Bezrukova took over the agency in January 2024, and her contract expires at the end of January 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/procurement-for-ukrainian-forces-may-be-blocked-due-to-legal-conflict-defense-procurement-agencys-head-says/	2025-01-27T08:30:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/DSC01217.jpg
Trump needs to 'understand where the threat is,' UK lawmaker says	U.S. President Donald Trump needs to &quot;understand where the threat is&quot; and not &quot;force Ukraine into a bad deal,&quot; U.K. lawmaker Iain Duncan Smith told the Kyiv Independent. In an interview in Kyiv alongside another U.K. lawmaker Layla Moran on Jan. 22, Smith urged Trump not to rush his approach to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and recognize that a &quot;totalitarian axis&quot; of Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea needs to be confronted. &quot;Just understand where the threat is. It&apos;s not Ukraine that&apos;s a threat,&quot; he said. &quot;The threat is Russia and China, Iran, North Korea, all these states are together. So don&apos;t force Ukraine into a bad deal,&quot; he added. Since taking office on Jan. 20, Trump has called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to &quot;make a deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine, warning that failure to reach an agreement would lead to increased sanctions, tariffs, and taxes on Russian goods. But his confrontational approach to the Kremlin has not been reflected in early comments about other members of the &quot;totalitarian axis.&quot; In comments via videolink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 23, Trump said he had &quot;always had a great relationship&quot; with Chinese President Xi Jinping, adding that he is looking forward to &quot;getting along with China.&#x201D; Referring to the war in Ukraine, Trump said &#xA0;China has &quot;a great deal of power over that situation&quot; and that he hoped the U.S. could work with Beijing to end the full-scale invasion. Despite issuing a slew of wide-ranging directives and executive orders in his first days in office, Trump is yet to impose his long-promised tariffs on Chinese imports. He also issued a reprieve to the Chinese-owned app TikTok, which was facing a ban in the U.S. All of this signals that the White House may be open to cutting deals with Beijing in economic and business matters. Former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith during an interview at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester, England, on Oct. 3, 2023. (Justin Tallis / AFP via Getty Images)But Smith said it was impossible to distinguish between business and geopolitics when dealing with China. &quot;It doesn&apos;t work,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;For these totalitarian states, business and politics are exactly one and the same thing.&quot; Originally raising the issue of the &quot;totalitarian axis&quot; in an op-ed published on Jan. 19, Smith said events since its publication only bolstered his case, highlighting a televised conference between Putin and Xi on the day Trump took office. &quot;It&apos;s quite interesting because it does just restate the fact that this (totalitarian axis) is there,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;The only reason Russia continues in this war is because of China.&quot; Although China has positioned itself as a possible mediator between Russia and Ukraine in future negotiations, Beijing remains Moscow&apos;s key economic ally and leading source of dual-use goods that feed the Kremlin&apos;s war machine. As for North Korea, in an interview on Jan. 23, Trump said he intends to reach out to Kim Jong Un, lauding him as a &quot;smart guy&quot; and &quot;not a religious zealot.&quot; Trump and Kim held three meetings during Trump&#x2019;s first term as president but neither one brought progress on the diplomatic front between the U.S. and North Korea. &quot;I&apos;ll reach out to him again,&quot; Trump said in an interview with Fox News. Kim has become one of Putin&#x2019;s key allies in the war against Ukraine, providing ballistic missiles and artillery and sending about 12,000 troops to fight in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran in her Westminster office, London, on Dec. 18, 2023. (Henry Nicholls / AFP via Getty Images)Both Smith and Moran &#x2014; who came to Ukraine to support the work of the British charity Hopefull which cooks up and delivers pizzas in communities close to the front lines &#x2014; said it was important to be in the country in the same week that Trump took office. The two believed it would be especially important if, in his inauguration speech, Trump hinted at forcing Ukraine to make concessions in a peace agreement unfavorable to Kyiv. &quot;It&apos;s interesting that Trump didn&apos;t say that,&quot; Moran said, adding he only alluded to Ukraine during sections criticizing former U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s foreign policy, and his plans for the U.S. military, the success of which would be measured &quot;not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end and, perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.&quot; &quot;But he didn&apos;t talk about (concessions) specifically and that can only be seen as a good thing,&quot; Moran said. &quot;But if Trump had said something that would have absolutely set the hares running, I thought it was personally really important (to be here). &quot;In that eventuality, to have friends on the ground and to look people in the eye and go, &apos;no, we are still on your side, you have a right to determine your own future,&apos; would have been really important,&quot; she added. As for the U.K.&apos;s support for Ukraine, Smith said he was &quot;very proud&quot; of the country&apos;s consistent support for Kyiv which has been in contrast to some of Kyiv&apos;s other European allies. Slovakia and Czechia are &quot;sliding in the other direction,&quot; Germany &quot;simply wasn&apos;t prepared for any of this,&quot; and France &quot;seems to play fast and loose with the whole issue.&quot; &quot;One day, they&apos;re gung-ho, the next day they&apos;re flirting with the idea of peace. Macron doesn&apos;t quite know where he&apos;s going to go one day to the next,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-needs-to-understand-where-the-threat-is-uk-lawmaker-says/	2025-01-27T08:06:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194444069.jpg
Kremlin backs Lukashenko's 'victory' in Belarus election, dismisses Western criticism	The Kremlin on Jan. 27 welcomed Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko&apos;s claimed election victory, dismissing Western criticism of the vote as &quot;expected.&quot; Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since 1994 and is Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s closest ally, was declared the winner with 86.82% of the vote. &quot;The elections in Belarus were transparent and absolutely legitimate. Moscow does not take into account the expected criticism of the elections in Belarus in the West,&quot; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian media. Lukashenko competed for the presidency against regime-approved candidates Sergey Syrankov, who secured 3.21% of the vote, and Oleg Gaidukevich, who received 2%, while 3.6% of ballots reportedly voted &quot;against all.&quot; EU&apos;s chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, criticized Lukashenko ahead of the election, denouncing it as a sham and an affront to democracy. &quot;Lukashenko has clung to power for 30 years. This is a blatant affront to democracy. Lukashenko doesn&#x2019;t have any legitimacy,&quot; she said. Exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who contested the 2020 election, condemned the results, calling the vote a &quot;special operation&quot; to illegally maintain power. The 2020 election, marked by mass protests and a violent crackdown, became pivotal in Belarus&apos; history. Lukashenko claimed victory despite widespread evidence of fraud, while Tsikhanouskaya asserted she won 60% of the vote. Since then, over 60,000 Belarusians have been detained for political reasons, according to the human rights group Viasna.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-backs-lukashenkos-victory-in-belarus-election-dismisses-western-criticism/	2025-01-27T07:50:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1962850139.jpg
EU to continue talks with Ukraine on gas supplies to Europe, including Hungary, Slovakia, Reuters reports	The European Commission will continue negotiations with Ukraine on gas supplies to Europe, including Hungary and Slovakia, according to an EU diplomat&apos;s statement obtained by Reuters on Jan. 27. Ukraine ended Russian gas supplies to Europe on Jan. 1, following the end of the contract. Some EU countries, including Hungary and Slovakia, still rely on Russian gas in their energy system. The EU diplomat&apos;s statement was read out before a meeting of EU foreign ministers, during which they were to discuss the extension of sanctions against Russia, according to Reuters. &quot;The Commission is ready to continue discussions with Ukraine on the supply to Europe through the gas pipeline system in Ukraine,&quot; the statement said. &quot;The Commission is ready to associate Hungary in the process along with Slovakia.&quot; EU foreign ministers eventually agreed to extend the sanctions, providing &quot;requested guarantees&quot; on energy security demanded by Budapest. Prior, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban threatened to veto the decision to extend the restrictions until Ukraine resumed transit of Russian gas to Europe. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, in turn, threatened to limit aid to Ukraine and decrease electricity supplies due to the termination of Russian gas transit. Fico and his Hungarian counterpart Orban have been among some of the most vocal opponents of Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit. Despite Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, Orban and Fico have continued to maintain friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting with him and promoting pro-Russian narratives in Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-to-continue-talks-with-ukraine-on-gas-supplies-to-europe-including-hungary-slovakia-reuters-reports/	2025-01-27T07:26:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1247343791.jpg
Russia intensifies attacks near Pokrovsk, seeks to encircle Ukrainian forces	Russian forces have intensified their assaults near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, deploying small groups in an attempt to encircle Ukrainian troops, Victor Trehubov, spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces, said on Jan. 27 on national television. &quot;For the first time, they started to fight smart; for the first time, they started to fight not just with direct human waves, but with attempts to cover, with attempts to bypass a large city and force Ukrainian forces to leave it,&quot; Trehubov said. The area near Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub for Ukrainian forces, has been at the center of heavy fighting for months. &quot;The situation is as follows: there is a large number of small-scale clashes near Pokrovsk because Russians are trying to enter and surround Pokrovsk from the west in small groups. There are many, many clashes there,&quot; Trehubov said. The estimated Russian advance in the Pokrovsk sector in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 27, 2025, according to DeepState map.

Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported that Russian troops are continuing to push on multiple axes, including Lyman, Siversk, Kramatorsk, Toretsk, and Kurakhove. Trehubov said the Russian command is avoiding urban battles to reduce heavy personnel losses. Despite these efforts, Moscow has so far failed to outflank Pokrovsk and sever its logistics routes.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-intensifies-attacks-near-pokrovsk-seeks-to-encircle-ukrainian-forces/	2025-01-27T07:14:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2191667263.jpg
EU screening of Ukraine’s legislation to continue until fall of 2025	The bilateral screening process of Ukrainian legislation for compliance with EU standards will continue until the fall of 2025, European Pravda reported on Jan. 27, citing the European Commission&apos;s spokesperson. Ukraine applied for EU membership at the onset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. The country has made quick progress, achieving candidate status within months, with the initial negotiations process formally launching in June 2024. If Ukraine fulfills all the requirements, the commission expects the launch of cluster negotiations, starting with Cluster I, &quot;Fundamentals,&quot; &quot;as soon as possible&quot; in 2025, the spokesperson told the Ukrainian media outlet. The commission submitted the first Cluster I screening report for Ukraine on Jan. 16. The Cluster I opens first and closes last in the EU accession negotiations. The presentation of the report is the first step in the EU accession negotiations, during which the commission familiarizes the candidate country with its rights and obligations. During the second stage, the commission assesses the candidate&apos;s progress in terms of legal harmonization and ability to apply the EU acquis. The screening report will then be discussed with member states in the EU Council, European Pravda reported. The spokesperson added that a unanimous decision of all EU member states is required in accession negotiations. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 15 that Ukraine has the &quot;ambitious goal&quot; of opening five or all the six EU accession negotiation clusters in 2025. Ukraine will open two or three negotiation clusters in the first six months of 2025 under Poland&apos;s rotating presidency, and three more during the second half of the year under the Danish presidency, the president said.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-screening-of-ukraine-legislation-to-last-until-fall/	2025-01-27T06:33:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167201231.jpg
Mural depicting top presidential aide Yermak appears in Kyiv, is painted over soon after	A mural depicting Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak was covered with white paint within a day after a picture of it emerged online, the Glavcom media outlet reported on Jan. 27. The mural was painted on the bank of the Dnipro River in Kyiv by an unknown artist. The original photo of the mural was shared on social media by journalist and blogger Bohdan Butkevych on Jan. 26, who also posted its location. Yermak has been described as the most powerful chief of staff in Ukraine&apos;s history, attracting criticism for accumulating unprecedented power and influence within the Presidential Office. &#x423; &#x43F;&#x430;&#x440;&#x43A;&#x443; &#xAB;&#x412;&#x435;&#x440;&#x431;&#x43D;&#x438;&#x439; &#x433;&#x430;&#x439;&#xBB; &#x445;&#x442;&#x43E;&#x441;&#x44C; &#x441;&#x442;&#x432;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x438;&#x432; &#x43C;&#x443;&#x440;&#x430;&#x43B; &#x456;&#x437; &#x437;&#x43E;&#x431;&#x440;&#x430;&#x436;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x43D;&#x44F;&#x43C; &#x404;&#x440;&#x43C;&#x430;&#x43A;&#x430;, &#x430;&#x43B;&#x435; &#x437;&#x430;&#x440;&#x430;&#x437; &#x43C;&#x430;&#x43B;&#x44E;&#x43D;&#x43E;&#x43A; &#x437;&#x430;&#x444;&#x430;&#x440;&#x431;&#x43E;&#x432;&#x430;&#x43D;&#x43E; &#x431;&#x456;&#x43B;&#x438;&#x43C; &#x43A;&#x43E;&#x43B;&#x44C;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x43E;&#x43C; pic.twitter.com/QftYRKL3Ha &quot;Banksy suddenly becoming a fan of Yermak is unlikely,&quot; Butkevych said jokingly, raising a question about the original painter&#x2019;s identity. Glavcom reported that already by the evening of Jan. 26, a picture of the mural largely painted over by a white paint appeared online. Other leading figures like former Commander-in-Chief General Valerii Zaluzhnyi also received a mural in the capital.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-mural-depicting-yermak-painted-over/	2025-01-27T06:11:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2030107886.jpg
Military intelligence denies its head gave Ukraine until summer to launch talks or endanger country’s existence	Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence (HUR) denied on Jan. 27 media reports that its head, Kyrylo Budanov, predicted serious consequences for the existence of Ukraine unless negotiations begin by the summer during a confidential parliamentary meeting. Although HUR&#x2019;s statement did not specify the alleged quote, an assessment attributed to Budanov began circulating in the Ukrainian media earlier on Jan. 27. &quot;If there are no serious negotiations by the summer, then very dangerous processes for the very existence of Ukraine may begin,&quot; an undisclosed source told Ukrainska Pravda, referring to an alleged statement by Budanov during a closed-door parliamentary meeting. &quot;The Ukrainian military intelligence would like to draw the attention&#x2026; to the fact that the alleged quote of (Budanov)... from a closed, classified session of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine&#x2026; is not true,&quot; HUR&#x2019;s statement read. Ukrainska Pravda did not specify what processes the military spy chief was said to have in mind. In office since 2020, Budanov has at time made radical predictions about the full-scale war that have not always come true. The news comes amid growing expectation of peace talks as U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table. Short on manpower, Kyiv will soon begin the fourth year of the full-scale war on its back foot, with Russia holding or pushing the front line on key directions such as the southwestern edge of Donetsk Oblast or Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. Trump&#x2019;s special peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, said the U.S. aims to end the war in the first 100 days of Trump&#x2019;s presidency.	https://kyivindependent.com/hur-denies-budanov-quote-in-media/	2025-01-27T06:00:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2030699290.jpg
Zelensky’s party’s parliamentary leader attended Trump’s inauguration, media reports	David Arakhamia, the parliamentary leader of President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s Servant of the People party, was among the few foreign dignitaries that attended U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration last week, Independent reported on Jan. 26. Arakhamia was attending the event along with former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, among others, Independent wrote. The lawmaker declined to comment on his presence at the inauguration when approached by the Kyiv Independent. Arakhamia also attended an event called Stars and Stripes &amp; Union Jack party on Jan. 17 before the inauguration, alongside the innermost circles of the Trump administration, Independent claimed, citing unnamed sources. Following the event, Arakhamia told the media that he expects a formal Ukrainian delegation to meet with the U.S. president&#x2019;s team next month. After his inauguration on Jan. 20, Trump reiterated his intent to pursue a peace deal in Ukraine but offered few specifics. Trump has also voiced his intent to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss a potential peace deal in Ukraine. The U.S. president told reporters on Jan. 20 that Putin is &quot;destroying Russia by not making a deal&quot; while acknowledging doubts about Moscow&apos;s willingness to negotiate. The Trump administration&apos;s Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, is also expected to visit Ukraine and meet Ukrainian officials.	https://kyivindependent.com/arakhamia-reportedly-at-trump-inauguration/	2025-01-27T04:41:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1263380211.jpg

North Korean troops temporarily withdraw from contact line in Kursk Oblast after losses, Sky News reports	North Korean soldiers temporarily withdrew from the contact line in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast after incurring heavy losses, Sky News reported on Jan. 27, citing a Ukrainian commander with a callsign &quot;Puls&quot; who is fighting in the area. North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in early August 2024. Ukrainian forces have continued fighting in the region, hoping to leverage their positions for potential negotiations. North Korean forces are taking respite from hostilities, presumably to treat the wounded, wait for reinforcements, and work on mistakes made during the fighting in this sector, according to Sky News. &quot;Puls&quot; assumed that this break will not last long and the North Korean military &quot;will be back soon.&quot; The soldier also noted North Korean troops&apos; high motivation and that they continued the offensive despite heavy losses. North Korean soldiers were unaware of the threats from drones and artillery and attacked on foot in large groups, &quot;like in World War II,&quot; becoming an easy target, &quot;Puls&quot; added. There is poor coordination and a language barrier between North Korean and Russian troops barrier that has already led to North Korean soldiers targeting Russian positions, according to the Ukrainian military. Ukrainian forces take DNA samples from killed North Korean soldiers to confirm their participation in Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. South Korean intelligence announced at the end of January that Pyongyang was planning to send more troops to Russia to participate in the war. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, also said previously that Pyongyang is preparing reinforcements, mainly gun and rocket artillery units. The New York Times reported that according to an undisclosed U.S. official, fresh North Korean troops could arrive within two months.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-temporarily-withdraw-from-contact-line-in-kursk-oblast-amid-heavy-losses-sky-news-reports/	2025-01-27T03:45:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029588238--1-.jpg
Hungary receives ’requested guarantees’ from EU on energy transit, Hungarian FM says	The EU has provided Hungary with &quot;requested guarantees&quot; regarding its &quot;energy security&quot; concerns, namely the transit of fossil fuels to EU member states, Hungary&#x2019;s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Jan. 27. &quot;The European Commission is committed to protecting natural gas and oil pipelines leading to European Union member states,&quot; the Hungarian chief diplomat said, adding that the European Commission will also ask Kyiv to maintain the oil transit through its territory. &quot;They made it clear that the integrity of the energy infrastructure supplying EU member states is a matter of security for the entire EU.&quot; The statement comes after Politico reported that EU ambassadors are expected to issue a statement addressing Hungary&#x2019;s &quot;energy security&quot; concerns to convince Budapest to drop its veto on the extension of the EU&#x2019;s sanctions on Russia. Hungary&#x2019;s Prime Minister Viktor Orban has threatened to veto the extension until Ukraine resumes the transit of Russian gas through its territory. The end of transit led to a spat between Kyiv on one side and Hungary and Slovakia on the other, with the two latter countries complaining the decision endangers their energy security. Ukraine continues to transit Russian oil, though a bill on banning the transit has been reigstered in the parliament. The EU sanctions against Russia, including the freezing of billions of Russian sovereign assets in European bank accounts, require a renewal by unanimous decision by the bloc every six months. The current deadline is set to expire on Jan. 31. Szijjarto did not reveal whether his country intends to lift its veto on the sanctions extension after the EU&#x2019;s decision. Earlier, Orban, a close ideological ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, demanded to vote on the renewal of the sanctions package only after Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Orban, whose government is widely regarded as the most Russia-friendly in the EU, has repeatedly criticized and delayed sanctions against Russia. Trump recently issued a warning to Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his war in Ukraine or face tariffs and further sanctions by the U.S. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also called his Hungarian counterpart on Jan. 26 to discuss, among others, energy issues, a statement by the U.S. Embassy to Hungary said, without revealing specifics of the discussion.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-receives-guarantees-on-energy/	2025-01-27T03:26:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1258722653.jpg

Zelensky arrives in Poland for Holocaust Remembrance Day commemoration	Editor&#x2019;s note: The story is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Poland for a commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi Auschwitz death camp, Zelensky&#x2019;s spokesperson, Serhii Nykyforov, told Ukrinform on Jan. 27. Jan. 27 marks the day when the Red Army liberated one of the largest Nazi death camps located in occupied Poland. The date was chosen as the International Holocaust Remembrance Day to commemorate the World War II-era massacre of 6 million Jews and millions of other victims by Nazi Germany. Prior to his visit to Poland, on Jan. 26, the Ukrainian president honored the Holocaust victims at the Babyn Yar National Historical and Memorial Reserve in Kyiv, a site of a Nazi massacre of Jews in 1941. Zelensky&#x2019;s visit to Poland will also include bilateral meetings with world leaders, namely with European Council President Antonio Costa and French President Emmanuel Macron, Nykyforov said. Dozens of other heads of state and government are attending the event, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and British King Charles III.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-arrives-in-poland-to-commemorate-holocaust-remembrance-day/	2025-01-27T02:33:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161013738.jpg
5 injured as Russia shells industrial area in Nikopol	Five men aged 30-39 were injured as a result of a Russian artillery attack against Nikopol in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast in the morning of Jan. 27, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. According to his statement, a fire broke out that was later extinguished, and an industrial facility was damaged. Nikopol, situated on the banks of the dried-up Kakhovka Reservoir, just across from Russian-occupied Enerhodar and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, is a regular target of Russian attacks. Today&#x2019;s attack comes weeks after Russian forces struck the central market in the city, injuring four women and two men. Only 3% of Russian missiles, drones, and guided bombs hit military targets in Ukraine, while 97% have struck civilian infrastructure, Danylo Kubai, Ukraine&apos;s envoy to international organizations in Vienna, said in July 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/5-injured-as-russia-shells-industrial-area-in-nikopol/	2025-01-27T01:44:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1850844674.jpg
Swedish Coast Guard detains vessel suspected of sabotage in Baltic Sea	Swedish prosecutors announced an investigation into a ship suspected of damaging undersea cables after it was detained by the Swedish Coast Guard, the AP news agency reported on Jan. 27. According to information obtained by the AP from a ship-tracker software, the Malta-flagged Vezhen departed from the Russian port of Ust-Luga several days earlier and was navigating near the site of damage. An underwater fiber-optic cable belonging to the Latvian State Radio and Television Broadcasting Center (LVRTC) was significantly damaged on Jan. 26, reportedly due to external impact, according to LVRTC representative Vineta Sprugaine. The accident came as the latest amid a series of incidents that have damaged critical cables in the Baltic Sea. The cable connected the Latvian town of Ventspils to Sweden&apos;s Gotland island and was located within Sweden&apos;s exclusive economic zone, the statement said. Despite the damage, data transmission services continued using alternate routes, with minimal impact on most end users in Latvia aside from slower data transmission speeds. The previous instances of damaged cables had raised fears that Russian shadow fleet vessels were intentionally sabotaging the energy and communication lines. As a result, NATO dispatched additional patrol ships to the area earlier this month. Contradicting these concerns, intelligence services in the U.S. and Europe are increasingly convinced that the incidents were caused by accidents, the Washington Post reported on Jan. 19.	https://kyivindependent.com/swedish-coast-guard-detains-vessel-suspected-of-sabotage-in-baltic-sea/	2025-01-27T01:32:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1238924684--1-.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure 7 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed two civilians and injured seven over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 27. Overnight on Jan. 27, the Russian military attacked Ukraine with 104 Shahed-type drones and decoy drones, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported on their Telegram channel. Air defenses shot down 57 drones over 10 oblasts, while 39 decoy drones were lost in the airspace, the Air Force said. One person was killed, and two others were injured as a result of the Russian military&#x2019;s attacks on the city of Kherson and 28 other regional settlements, Kherson Oblast Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on his Telegram channel. One person was killed and four were injured in Donetsk Oblast as a result of Russia&#x2019;s attacks, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Due to Russian attacks on the city of Kupiansk, an 86-year-old woman was injured in Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Russian drones also targeted a critical infrastructure facility in western Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Governor Svitlana Onyshchuk reported. The strike started a fire but inflicted no casualties, she said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-2-injure-7-over-past-day/	2025-01-27T00:29:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/2025-01-27-10_26_21.jpg
Russia claims to capture Velyka Novosilka, Ukraine admits partial withdrawal	Russia&#x2019;s Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 26 that its forces had captured Velyka Novosilka, a strategically significant settlement in the western part of Donetsk Oblast. Ukraine&#x2019;s 110th Mechanized Brigade, which is deployed in the area, acknowledged a withdrawal from parts of the village to avoid encirclement but claimed that fighting is ongoing elsewhere in Velyka Novosilka. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The village with a pre-war population of 5,000 lies only around 15 kilometers from the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast and 20 kilometers from Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a region so far untouched by Russian occupation. The estimated Russian advance at Velyka Novosilka, Donetsk Oblast, as of Jan. 26, 2025, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)If confirmed, this would represent the most significant gain of Russian forces in Donetsk Oblast since overrunning Kurakhove earlier in January. The 110th Brigade said that both Russia and Ukraine had parity in equipment but Moscow had significant advantage in manpower. According to the Ukrainian military, Russian forces will struggle to advance their offensive onward. The Mokri Yaly River creates an obstacle for Russia&#x2019;s advance and Russian troops are in a vulnerable &quot;fire pocket,&quot; said the brigade. Fighting is at a very heavy level in Donetsk Oblast and Russian troops continue to advance, albeit slowly, this year. &#x200B;&#x200B;Throughout the fall of 2024, Russian forces made operational gains in southern Donetsk Oblast, including areas near Toretsk and Chasiv Yar, while advancing near Kupiansk and on Russian soil in Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-to-capture-velyka-novosilka/	2025-01-26T23:05:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1997061526.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 831,620 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 831,620 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 27. This number includes 1,430 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,871 tanks, 20,561 armored fighting vehicles, 35,183 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,339 artillery systems, 1,263 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,050 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 23,327 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-831-620-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-26T22:29:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164069605.jpg
Lukashenko declares himself 'winner' of Belarus’s presidential vote blasted as sham	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko declared himself president for his seventh consecutive term in an election on Jan. 26 internationally deemed as neither free nor fair. The Belarusian Election Commission claimed that Lukashenko &quot;won&quot; 86.82% of the vote, followed by regime-approved and little-known candidates like Sergey Syrankov with 3.21% or Oleg Gaidukevich with 2.02%. Some 3.6% of the ballots voted &quot;against all.&quot; &quot;You can congratulate the Republic of Belarus, we have elected a president,&quot; said Igor Karpenko, the head of the electoral commission, early on Jan. 27. The commission claimed a 85.7% turnout. Lukashenko, the country&apos;s leader since 1994 and Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s closest ally, has long been accused of staging fraudulent elections in Belarus. In 2020, during the last presidential election, Lukashenko maintained power despite the country&apos;s most prominent opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, receiving popular support. The now-exiled opposition leader said she won with 60% of the vote. Following the fabricated results in 2020, mass protest erupted in Minsk but were ultimately quelled with the support of Russia. According to the Belarusian human rights group Viasna, over 60,000 citizens have been detained for political reasons since the 2020 election. Tsikhanouskaya responded to the election results on Jan. 26 by condemning the legitimacy of the vote and rejecting Lukashenko as president. &quot;These are not elections but a &apos;special operation&apos; to illegally cling to power. Lukashenko, propped up by Putin, holds 9 million Belarusians hostage, drags us into war, and betrays our sovereignty,&quot; she wrote on X. &quot;He does not represent Belarus. The regime must end its repressions, release political prisoners, and be held accountable for its crimes. Belarusians will prevail!&quot; Kaja Kallas, the EU&#x2019;s chief diplomat, echoed similar sentiments on X on Jan. 25. &quot;Lukashenko has clung to power for 30 years. Tomorrow, he&#x2019;ll reappoint himself in yet another sham election. This is a blatant affront to democracy. Lukashenko doesn&#x2019;t have any legitimacy,&quot; she said. Notably, Lukashenko declined to invite a mission from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to observe the country&apos;s presidential election. On Nov. 22, state-run news outlet Belta reported that Lukashenko may completely shut down the internet during the 2025 presidential elections if protests similar to those in 2020 arise. &quot;If this (the protests) happens again, we will shut the internet down completely,&quot; Lukashenko said, admitting that internet shutdowns during the 2020 protests were carried out with his approval. While Belarus has not directly participated in the war against Ukraine, it has allowed the Kremlin to use its territory as a staging ground for its operations. The country is also reportedly hosting Russian tactical nuclear arms on its territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-declares-himself-winner-of-belarusian-presidential-election-seventh-term-to-begin/	2025-01-26T22:19:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2153837875.jpg
Explosions reported in Khmelnytskyi, Ivano-Frankivsk amid drone attack, apartment building damaged in Dnipro	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Several explosions were heard overnight on Jan. 27 in the western Ukrainian cities of Ivano-Frankivsk and Khmelnytskyi as Russia launched a drone attack on Ukraine. Ivano-Frankivsk Mayor Ruslan Martsinkiv urged residents to stay in shelters, as the air raid alert had been active in the region for over two hours. Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast had previously been targeted by Russia on Jan. 15, with the attack damaging &quot;critical infrastructure facilities&quot; in the area, though no casualties were reported at that time. Meanwhile, a drone attack on Jan. 27 also damaged a multi-story residential building in Dnipro, affecting the technical floor, windows, and doors on the upper levels. The explosion and debris caused significant damage to vehicles parked nearby. No immediate reports of injuries or fatalities have been confirmed.	https://kyivindependent.com/explosions-reported-in-khmelnytsky-ivano-frankivsk-amid-drone-attack-apartment-building-damaged-in-dnipro/	2025-01-26T19:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1244030448-1665987223fwizj.jpg
Belarus releases American citizen amid controversial election	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on Jan. 26 that Belarus had &quot;unilaterally&quot; released an American woman from detention, as Alexander Lukashenko is set to win a seventh term in office. Rubio identified the U.S. citizen as Anastassia Nuhfer, who was detained during former President Joe Biden&apos;s tenure. He did not provide details on the timing or reasons for her arrest. Rubio&apos;s statement followed a series of prisoner releases by Lukashenko, often referred to as &quot;Europe&#x2019;s last dictator.&quot; Belarus&apos; oldest human rights group, Viasna, reports that over 1,250 individuals remain in detention for opposing the government. Lukashenko&#x2019;s opponents, many imprisoned or exiled due to his ongoing crackdown on dissent, have condemned Sunday&#x2019;s election as fraudulent. The 2020 election, which sparked months of mass protests, has been widely criticized for its lack of legitimacy. The U.S. State Department later confirmed that Nuhfer had been detained in early December 2024, according to the Associated Press. Earlier this month, a consular officer from Washington gained rare access to her in detention. A former high-ranking Belarusian diplomat told the Associated Press that Nuhfer&apos;s arrest was tied to the 2020 protests, though they did not provide further details. The diplomat, speaking anonymously due to security concerns, added that Lukashenko offered to release Nuhfer &quot;as a gesture of goodwill&quot; but refused to free any Belarusian opposition or rights activists. Lukashenko&#x2019;s support for Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine has strained Belarus&#x2019; relations with both the U.S. and the EU, ending his previous attempts to leverage Western support for more subsidies from Moscow. It remains unclear what, if any, concessions Belarus may have sought in exchange for releasing Nuhfer.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-releases-american-citizen-amid-controversial-election/	2025-01-26T18:17:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1257107756.jpg
Hungary blocks EU statement condemning Belarus election as undemocratic, RFE/RL reports	Hungarian representatives blocked a joint statement by European Union member states rejecting the presidential election in Belarus, sources told Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) in Brussels. Without unanimous support from all 27 EU countries, EU&apos;s chief diplomat Kaja Kallas issued her own statement, declaring that the Jan. 26 election &quot;neither free, nor fair.&quot; She also called on Belarusian authorities to release all political prisoners, &quot;over a thousand of whom are arbitrarily detained, including an employee of the Delegation of the European Union.&quot; Kallas criticized the regime&#x2019;s late invitation to independent election monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), only 10 days before the vote, which she said prevented access to critical stages of the electoral process. &quot;This is yet another proof of a total absence of credibility of these elections,&quot; she said. She further emphasized that Belarus&#x2019;s role in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine and its hybrid attacks on neighboring countries justifies continued EU sanctions and restrictions on the regime. &quot;...The EU will continue imposing restrictive and targeted measures against the regime, while financially supporting civil society, Belarusian democratic forces in exile, and Belarusian culture,&quot; Kallas said. She also noted the EU&#x2019;s readiness to assist Belarus with stabilizing its economy and reforming its institutions once the country begins a democratic transition. Hungary refused to sign the draft statement referring to Belarus&apos;s &quot;undemocratic presidential elections&quot; and was initially joined by Slovakia, according to RFE/RL. However, Slovakia later agreed to support the text, which described the elections as lacking legitimacy due to &quot;relentless and unprecedented repression of human rights,&quot; and severe restrictions on opposition and independent media. Hungarian authorities, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, maintained their opposition. Hungary has consistently resisted tougher sanctions against Russia and increased European support for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-blocks-eu-statement-condemning-belarus-election-as-undemocratic-rfe-rl-reports/	2025-01-26T17:46:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190447641.jpg
Lukashenko poised to secure 7th term in Belarus 'sham' election	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko appeared set to win a seventh term in office on Jan. 26 in an election widely dismissed by the West and opposition groups as a sham. Lukashenko has reportedly secured 86.82% of the vote, according to preliminary results announced by the country&#x2019;s Central Election Commission on Monday. The 70-year-old leader, who has ruled since 1994, faced no real competition, as key opposition figures are either imprisoned or living in exile following years of political repression. Lukashenko&apos;s 2020 re-election, widely criticized as fraudulent, sparked unprecedented protests in Belarus, leading to over 65,000 arrests and widespread reports of police brutality. Western nations responded with sanctions and condemnation. The president, who has relied heavily on Russian subsidies and backing to maintain his grip on power, campaigned this time on a platform of &quot;peace and security.&quot; Lukashenko justified his close alliance with Moscow, which included allowing Russia to use Belarusian territory to launch its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and hosting Russian tactical nuclear weapons. &quot;It&#x2019;s better to have a dictatorship like in Belarus than a democracy like Ukraine,&quot; Lukashenko said during his campaign. Observers suggest the election date was strategically moved to January, avoiding the warmer months when protests might have been more likely. Economic challenges and the ongoing war in Ukraine have heightened tensions in Belarus, but the government ensured no significant opposition emerged in the lead-up to the vote. On election day, Lukashenko engaged in a four-hour press conference where he dismissed criticism about the fairness of the election. Asked about the absence of opposition figures, he replied: &quot;Some chose prison, some chose &apos;exile,&apos; as you say. We didn&#x2019;t kick anyone out of the country.&quot; He also denied allegations of suppressing dissent, claiming opponents had made their own decisions regarding their fate.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-poised-to-secure-7th-term-in-belarus-sham-election/	2025-01-26T15:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1507209313.jpg
Zelensky appoints Ground Forces Commander as lead of Khortytsia Group	President Volodymyr Zelensky appointed Major General Mykhailo Drapatyi, Commander of the Ground Forces of Ukraine, as the head of the Khortytsia Operational Strategic Group on Jan. 26. &quot;Today, I ordered a strengthening of the command structure of our forces in the Donetsk region,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address. He noted that Drapatyi&#x2019;s leadership will focus on the most intense combat areas while also ensuring proper training for brigades. Drapatyi will continue in his role as Commander of the Ground Forces, the largest component of the Armed Forces. Zelensky appointed Drapatyi as commander in Nov. 2024. Drapatyi served as a commander of Ukraine&apos;s 58th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade from 2016 to 2019. He also played one of the key roles in the liberation of Mariupol in Donetsk Oblast in 2014. Additionally, Brigadier General Andrii Hnatov has been appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff to improve coordination between operational headquarters and the front lines. Previously, Hnatov served as Commander of the Joint Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Zelensky appointed him to that role in June 2024. Zelensky said that these and other changes were discussed with Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi to address key military tasks at all levels. &#x201C;The specific needs of the front must determine the standards for equipping and training brigades,&#x201D; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-appoints-ground-forces-commander-as-lead-of-khortytsia-group/	2025-01-26T12:32:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/q132bb595v3e1.jpeg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine strikes drone storage facility in Russia's Oryol Oblast and destroys 200 Shaheds, General Staff reports	Key developments on Jan. 25-26: Ukrainian Air Force units and Defense Forces struck drone storage facilities in Russia&apos;s western Oryol Oblast on Jan. 26, the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces reported on Facebook on Jan. 26. The strike targeted concrete structures housing thermobaric warheads for drones, causing a significant secondary detonation. &#x201C;The results and extent of the damage are being specified, but it is preliminary known that more than 200 &#x2018;Shaheds&#x2019; will no longer be used against our country,&#x201D; the statement said. Preliminary reports indicate that over 200 Shahed strike drones were destroyed, rendering them unusable for future attacks on Ukraine. The statement emphasized that operations against critical facilities supporting attacks on Ukraine&#x2019;s civilian infrastructure will continue. Russia has launched thousands of cheap but effective Iranian-designed Shahed drones against Ukraine since the fall of 2022. Shaheds and its domestic-made variants like Geran are often used for strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Shahed-136 drones&apos; flying range, claimed by various sources, varies from 1,000 kilometers (about 620 miles) to 2,500 kilometers (about 1,550 miles). They are said to weigh about 200 kilograms with a maximum flight speed of about 185 kilometers (115 miles) per hour. Western media, such as the New York Times, has reported the cost of each Shahed-136 drone to be as low as $20,000. The Oryol region was the target of numerous Ukrainian attacks over the last month, when a drone storage, maintenance, and repair facility was destroyed on Dec. 28 and when an oil depot was hit by drones, later catching on fire, on Dec. 22. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on Jan. 24 new guidance that halts spending on most foreign aid grants for 90 days. This directive, which took State Department officials by surprise, appears to include funding for military assistance to Ukraine, Politico reports. According to a document obtained by the news outlet, the guidance requires staff to issue &quot;stop-work orders&quot; on nearly all &quot;existing foreign assistance awards&quot; and is effective immediately. The Kyiv Independent can&apos;t immediately verify this information. Rubio&apos;s guidance goes beyond President Donald Trump&#x2019;s recent executive order, which called for a 90-day pause on foreign aid grants while the secretary reviews them. The president&apos;s order left some ambiguity about whether already appropriated funds or Ukraine aid would be affected, but Rubio&apos;s directive makes it clear that no further actions will be taken to disburse funds for already approved programs, according to current and former officials familiar with the matter. The sweeping nature of the mandate shocked many within the department. &quot;State just totally went nuclear on foreign assistance,&quot; one official told Politico. While the document allows some exceptions&#x2014;such as foreign military financing for Egypt and Israel, emergency food assistance, and &quot;legitimate expenses incurred prior to the date of this&quot; guidance&#x2014;its broad scope leaves room for interpretation. It also states that decisions must remain &quot;consistent with the terms of the relevant award.&quot; Officials believe the halt will affect key allies, including Ukraine, Jordan, and Taiwan. One State Department official and two former Biden administration officials, all speaking anonymously, voiced concerns about the potential impact on these partners. The guidance could expose the U.S. government to lawsuits for unfulfilled contracts if the terms are found to be violated. However, the directive states that decisions regarding the continuation, modification, or termination of programs will follow Rubio&#x2019;s review. The omission of Ukraine aid is particularly concerning for American officials who see supporting Ukraine as essential to defeating Russia. While Republicans, including Trump, have long criticized what they view as wasteful foreign aid under Democratic administrations, Trump has recently intensified his stance on Russia. He has threatened Moscow with sanctions if it does not end its nearly three-year invasion of Ukraine and declared that &quot;Putin bears responsibility for ending the war.&quot; The guidance was reviewed and cleared by several senior State Department officials, including counselor Michael Needham and policy planning director Michael Anton. The department is now tasked with preparing a report within 85 days of the guidance&#x2019;s issuance. Russia fired 1,250 aerial bombs, over 750 attack drones, and 20 missiles at Ukraine in the last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan 26.The attacks targeted Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv,Donetsk, Kherson, Sumy, Kharkiv, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts. One of the worst attacks of the week killed at least one person and injured 45 in Zaporizhzhia after Russian forces pummeled the city with drones and missiles, hitting apartment blocks.Overnight on Jan. 25-26, Russian troops launched 72 drones. Ukraine&#x2019;s air defense downed 50, said the Air Force.&#x201C;Long-range capabilities are crucial. Sanctions are essential. Lowering the price of oil is important. The key is to act in unity and protect lives with resolve,&#x201D; Zelensky wrote on social media.In one of his first address since taking office, President Donald Trump threatened to leverage sanctions against Moscow as well as tackle oil prices that keep Russia&#x2019;s economy afloat.During his speech to the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos on Jan. 23, Trump said that lowering oil prices would end Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine &#x201C;immediately.&#x201D; He said he would ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to decrease oil prices.He&#x2019;s also pushed for ramped-up drilling for U.S. oil and gas which could also undermine Russia&#x2019;s fuel sector.A day before the WEF, Trump said that if a &quot;deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine was not reached soon, he would have no choice but to &quot;put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries.&quot; Ukrainian troops avoided encirclement as Russian forces are poised to capture Velyka Novosilka, Donetsk Oblast, said the 110th Separate Mechanised Brigade. Ukrainian troops successfully withdrew from some areas to avoid being encircled but fighting is ongoing around the village, which lies around 15 kilometers east of the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Equipment on both sides wears thin but Russian infantry vastly outnumbers the Ukrainian side, the brigade wrote on its Telegram channel. While Russian troops will likely capture the village soon, they will struggle to advance their offensive onward. The Mokri Yaly River creates an obstacle for Russia&#x2019;s advance and Russian troops are in a vulnerable &#x201C;fire pocket,&#x201D; said the brigade. &#x201C;Any movement is suppressed by shells and drones,&quot; said the brigade. The river also hindered supply routes to the Ukrainians. On Jan 23, Military spokesperson Viktor Trehubov warned that Ukrainian troops were at risk of encirclement. Russian forces are attempting to take control of access routes to the village through heavy fire, Trehubov noted. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 24 that its troops had planted a Russian flag in the center of Velyka Novosilka and that they had split the town in two, cutting off Ukrainian forces. The southern pocket fell most recently. Experts told the Kyiv Independent that Ukrainian troops were likely holding onto the village&apos;s northwestern areas and Russia expected to complete the capture in &#x201C;days.&#x201D; If they do, it will be Russia&#x2019;s first notable win this year. It is unclear how many Ukrainian troops were trapped inside the southern pocket in Velyka Novosilka, but it could be around two or three battalions, according to Pasi Paroinen at the Finland-based open-source intelligence organization Black Bird Group. The number of soldiers is probably around several hundred, he added. Fighting is at a very heavy level in Donetsk Oblast and Russian troops continue to advance, albeit slowly, this year. &#x200B;&#x200B;Throughout the fall of 2024, Russian forces made operational gains in southern Donetsk Oblast, including areas near Toretsk and Chasiv Yar, while advancing near Kupiansk and on Russian soil in Kursk Oblast. A fire erupted at Russia&apos;s Ryazan Oil Refinery after a drone strike overnight on Jan. 26, according to Russian media reports. The reported strike comes two nights after the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces (SOS) launched a joint attack against the Ryazan Oil Refinery on Jan. 24. Locals reported sounds of explosions and an attempted drone attack on the refinery shortly before 1 a.m. on Jan. 26, the Russian Telegram news channel Astra said. Ryazan Oblast Governor Pavlo Malkov confirmed that Russian air defense units were repelling a drone attack in the region. Andrii Kovalenko, the counter-disinformation chief at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, posted video to his official Telegram channel purporting to show a fire at the refinery after it was hit by drones. Astra confirmed that video footage of the fires circulating online was filmed at the site of the refinery, but said that because of the timing of the strike it was difficult to determine whether the fire was from a new hit or the Jan. 24 attack. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims at the time of publication. The Ryazan Oil Refinery, one of Russia&apos;s largest, has the capacity to process 17 million metric tons of oil per year. Profits from fossil fuels fund Russia&apos;s war machine and Ukraine considers oil industry facilities to be valid military targets. Ryazan lies roughly 500 kilometers (310 miles) north of Ukraine&apos;s border. Ukrainian forces have targeted the Ryazan facility in previous attacks. An SBU source told the Kyiv Independent that at least three oil depots and a workshop were set ablaze in the Jan. 24 strike. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) also carried out a drone attack on the Ryazan Oil Refinery on May 1, 2024. Kovalenko said on Jan. 24 that the refinery is a key facility in Russia&apos;s military-industrial complex. &quot;The refinery plays an important role in providing fuel for both the civilian and military-industrial complex of Russia,&quot; he said on Telegram. &quot;It produces fuel for military equipment, aviation kerosene, diesel fuel and other types of petroleum products used in tanks, aircraft, ships and other equipment of the Russian Armed Forces.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-strikes-drone-storage-facility-in-russias-oryol-oblast-and-destroys-200-shaheds-general-staff-reports/	2025-01-26T12:01:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/ryazan.jpg
Ukraine strikes drone storage facility in Russia's Oryol Oblast and destroys 200 Shaheds, General Staff reports	Ukrainian Air Force units and Defense Forces struck drone storage facilities in Russia&apos;s western Oryol Oblast on Jan. 26, the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces reported on Facebook on Jan. 26. The strike targeted concrete structures housing thermobaric warheads for drones, causing a significant secondary detonation. &#x201C;The results and extent of the damage are being specified, but it is preliminary known that more than 200 &#x2018;Shaheds&#x2019; will no longer be used against our country,&#x201D; the statement said. Preliminary reports indicate that over 200 Shahed strike drones were destroyed, rendering them unusable for future attacks on Ukraine. The statement emphasized that operations against critical facilities supporting attacks on Ukraine&#x2019;s civilian infrastructure will continue. Russia has launched thousands of cheap but effective Iranian-designed Shahed drones against Ukraine since the fall of 2022. Shaheds and its domestic-made variants like Geran are often used for strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Shahed-136 drones&apos; flying range, claimed by various sources, varies from 1,000 kilometers (about 620 miles) to 2,500 kilometers (about 1,550 miles). They are said to weigh about 200 kilograms with a maximum flight speed of about 185 kilometers (115 miles) per hour. Western media, such as the New York Times, has reported the cost of each Shahed-136 drone to be as low as $20,000. The Oryol region was the target of numerous Ukrainian attacks over the last month, when a drone storage, maintenance, and repair facility was destroyed on Dec. 28 and when an oil depot was hit by drones, later catching on fire, on Dec. 22.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-drone-storage-facility-in-russias-oryol-oblast-and-destroys-200-shaheds-general-staff-reports/	2025-01-26T11:21:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1489471985.jpg
Fiber-optic cable between Latvia and Sweden significantly damaged in Baltic Sea, investigation underway	An underwater fiber-optic cable belonging to the Latvian State Radio and Television Broadcasting Center (LVRTC) was significantly damaged on Jan. 26, reportedly due to external impact, according to LVRTC representative Vineta Sprugaine. The cable connected the Latvian town of Ventspils to Sweden&apos;s Gotland island and was located within Sweden&apos;s exclusive economic zone, the statement said. Despite the damage, data transmission services continued using alternate routes, with minimal impact on most end users in Latvia aside from slower data transmission speeds. NATO has already dispatched additional patrol ships to the region in response to concerns over the safety of critical infrastructure. LVRTC has informed the relevant authorities, and inspections are ongoing, though the exact nature of the damage, which occurred at a depth of over 50 meters, will only be confirmed during repair work. Latvian Prime Minister Evika Sili&#x146;a convened a meeting with ministers and service heads to address the incident, emphasizing continued cooperation with NATO and Baltic Sea region countries to investigate the circumstances. &#x201C;We are working together with our Swedish Allies and NATO on investigating the incident, including patrolling the area, as well as inspecting the vessels that were in the area. Authorities have intensified information exchange and started criminal investigation,&#x201D; Silina wrote on X. This marks the second recent incident of damaged critical cables in the Baltic Sea. The cable damage on Jan. 26 follows the Dec. 25 sabotage of four telecommunication cables and one power cable in the Baltic Sea, with Finnish authorities suspecting the involvement of the Russian &quot;shadow fleet&quot; vessel Eagle S. Amid a series of similar events, the incidents had raised fears that Russian shadow fleet vessels were intentionally sabotaging the energy and communication lines. As a result, NATO dispatched additional patrol ships to the area earlier this month. However, intelligence services in the U.S. and Europe increasingly believe the damage is caused by maritime accidents, not deliberate sabotage, according to the Washington Post on Jan. 19. Still, investigations are ongoing, and growing concerns over Russian sabotage remain, particularly in light of heightened tensions in the Baltic Sea region since Western nations began supporting Ukraine following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Recent incidents, such as suspicious activity by Russian-registered vessels near Denmark and Sweden, have added to fears of potential hybrid warfare targeting critical infrastructure in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/fiber-optic-cable-between-latvia-and-sweden-significantly-damaged-in-baltic-sea-investigation-underway/	2025-01-26T10:38:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1241362288.jpg
Suspilne: Washington orders USAID to suspend projects and funding in Ukraine	The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), one of the largest official aid agencies in the world, has been told to stop projects in Ukraine following a 90-day foreign aid freeze imposed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Ukrainian media Suspilne reported, citing sources in the agency, on Jan. 26. The sweeping directive took immediate effect on Jan. 24, leaving many aid agencies in limbo as they were told to stop work on existing projects while the U.S. audits foreign aid programs. Initially, senior diplomats in the State Department&#x2019;s Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs requested a full waiver to exclude USAID operations in Ukraine, citing national security concerns. However, an anonymous USAID employee told Suspilne that the agency was still ordered to halt its projects and spending on them. Employees don&#x2019;t have clear instructions on how to carry this out or if there are some exceptions, the source said. USAID is heavily involved in Ukraine&#x2019;s wartime needs and has provided over $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and $30 billion in direct budgeting support since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Already, some of the projects that USAID funds are pausing their work. Ivona Kostyna, the co-founder of Veteran Hub which offers services to veterans, said the organization had to close operations in Vinnytsia because of the directive. &#x201C;For our clients, this includes professional legal and psychological consultations, support in finding a job, educational and grant opportunities, personal support at every stage of their journey online and in person in Vinnytsia,&#x201D; Kostyna wrote on Facebook. The freeze has left hundreds of foreign aid contracts, valued at over $70 billion in the 2022 fiscal year, in limbo as a review process unfolds over the next 85 days, according to the Financial Times. Ukrainian officials and NGOs warned that the pause could jeopardize critical initiatives, including support for schools, hospitals, and infrastructure development. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that military aid to Ukraine is not affected, during a press conference with Moldovan President Maia Sandu on Jan. 25.	https://kyivindependent.com/suspilne-washington-orders-usaid-to-suspend-projects-and-funding-in-ukraine/	2025-01-26T08:36:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1697747096.jpg
I felt needed:' How the Invictus Games help wounded Ukrainian veterans adapt to life after war	On either side of a basketball court in Kyiv, prostheses of various sizes rest alongside piles of water bottles, as two teams in wheelchairs fiercely compete for the ball just tossed up in the air to kick off the game. The players &#x2014; wounded Ukrainian service members and veterans &#x2014; are training for the upcoming Invictus Games, an international sports competition for soldiers who have suffered life-altering injuries and sicknesses while fighting. Among those players is Valerii Odainyk, a sapper of the 93rd separate mechanized brigade &quot;Kholodnyi Yar,&quot; who lost his legs and some of his fingers in a mine explosion in January 2023. Odainyk is currently training to compete in wheelchair basketball and rugby, as well as sitting volleyball at the games this year, which are taking place in Canada from Feb. 8&#x2013;14. Ukraine will be represented by 35 participants at the 2025 competition. &quot;Given that my throwing hand does not have fingers, I had to adapt, which I more or less have at this point,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;On the court, we all feel the rhythm of the game &#x2014; everyone is passionate and energized. You feel the best after a good and friendly game.&quot; Valerii Odainyk, a sapper with the 93rd Separate Mechanized Brigade &quot;Kholodnyi Yar,&quot; who lost his legs and several fingers in a mine explosion in January 2023. (Invictus Games: Team Ukraine)The Invictus Games, created in 2014 by Prince Harry, has sought to create a community for service members like Odaiynyk, bringing people together through the games themselves and creating a larger network of service members who have lived through the experience of war. The Economist estimates that nearly 400,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been injured and are unable to return to the front line. After coming back from the battlefield or captivity, soldiers are often left to deal with their physical and mental trauma alone. As of July 2024, there are 1.3 million veterans in Ukraine, of whom nearly 80% are mobilized, Suspilne reported, citing the Veterans Affairs Ministry. &quot;Many people return from the battlefield and simply disappear. You need to feel needed so as not to get lost,&quot; Odaiynyk said. As the Ukrainians participating in the games train for their upcoming competitions, they say training and taking part in the games have helped them to adapt to civilian life, and learn to live with their injuries, both physical and mental. &quot;(The games are) a physical activity that restores the feeling of your body. To regain the ability to move, to control yourself and, as a result, to accept yourself &#x2014; this is the main goal,&quot; Olga Semenova, psychologist of the Ukrainian Invictus Games team, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;People really open up on the team. These changes are even greater than they seem from the outside. A person becomes more sociable and finds new interests. The participants then visit each other and communicate, even though they come from different regions,&quot; she added. Like other Invictus Games participants, Odainyk has already completed five training camps to prepare for the upcoming games, some dedicated to team sports and others to individual disciplines. Depending on their injuries, the participants work either individually or in groups. Members of Ukraine&apos;s team of the Invictus Games: Viacheslav Kaistro (L), Oleksii Prytula (C), and Oleksii Vasyliuk (R) in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Ukraine on Jan. 12, 2025. (Invictus Games: Team Ukraine)The Ukrainian team held its last training camp on the mountain slopes of Bukovel in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, as winter sports will make a debut at the upcoming competition in Canada. Odainyk, who skied for the first time while wearing prostheses, said the team skied all day with only a break for lunch to get prepared. &quot;It was scary to fall for the first time because you don&apos;t know how your legs will react, whether it will hurt. But after you fall for the first time, nothing is scary anymore. The fear disappears by itself,&quot; he added. When asked if he is ready to represent Ukraine in Canada. Odainyk replied with no doubt: &quot;Yes, 100%.&quot; Another participant this year, Alla Senchenko, is preparing for her debut in Canada, where she will compete in the skeleton. Senchenko said she has only trained in the basics of skeleton. The upcoming games in Canada will be the first time she completes a trial high-speed skeleton race on an ice track. &quot;It&apos;s scary, but I want to (try competing in skeleton),&quot; she said. &quot;Because life, like war, goes on. It&apos;s not for me to hide in a corner.&quot; Senchenko, a former soldier of the 2nd Separate Rifle Battalion of the Volyn Territorial Defense Forces, spent just over eight months in Russian captivity after being captured in Lyman, Donetsk Oblast in May 2022. Senchenko was recently demobilized and is currently studying to become a clinical psychologist. Alla Senchenko, a former soldier with the 2nd Separate Rifle Battalion of the Volyn Territorial Defense Forces, was held in Russian captivity for more than eight months after being captured in Lyman, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, in May 2022. (Invictus Games: Team Ukraine)After her release, Senchenko had significant health problems that she is still dealing with today. Captivity also left a strong imprint on her mental state. &quot;When I returned (from captivity), I felt it all. I&#x2019;m depressed now. &#xA0;It is a new challenge for me,&quot; Senchenko said, referring to dealing with her mental health. While undergoing rehabilitation in her native Volyn Oblast in western Ukraine, Senchenko learned about the Invictus Games and did not hesitate to join. The former soldier said she found solace in sports after Russian captivity, where the so-called workouts under the supervision of brutal guards were more like torture. &quot;Sport relieves at least some tension. You concentrate on your body instead of negative thoughts in your head. Someone says something nice to you, and you talk to someone. It helps,&quot; she said. Arsen Riaboshapko, a sailor in civilian life, was mobilized to the 77th separate airmobile brigade at the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Riaboshapko was wounded in a firefight in the Bakhmut district of Donetsk Oblast. One bullet went through and hit only the soft tissue of his thigh, while another hit his thigh bone. Following a series of surgeries and stretching ligaments in his leg through dreadfully painful physical therapy, Riaboshapko was driving in his car one day and heard an advertisement for the Invictus Games on the radio. Arsen Riaboshapko, a sailor in civilian life, was drafted into the 77th Separate Airmobile Brigade at the onset of the full-scale invasion. (Invictus Games: Team Ukraine)He was unsure whether to apply, as he didn&apos;t think his injury was &quot;severe enough&quot; to participate. &quot;I have all my limbs. I didn&#x2019;t think it was for me,&quot; Riaboshapko said. &quot;Often, you perceive such an injury as insufficient because society does not notice it either. It seems to be invisible.&quot; Riaboshapko changed his mind after joining the Invictus Games team and finding support among active soldiers and veterans. This year he is planning to compete in wheelchair basketball and rugby, sitting volleyball, alpine skiing, and rowing on simulators. He and his friends have also founded a non-governmental organization in Odesa that aims to help wounded veterans engage in adaptive sports. Members of the Ukrainian team of the Invictus Games in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Ukraine on Jan. 12, 2025. (Invictus Games: Team Ukraine)&apos;You just become homebound&apos; The national organizing committee of the Invictus Games holds almost monthly training camps for those selected for the national team. The participants remain in touch with their coaches and psychologists beyond the camps. But for team members with serious injuries, life outside of the Invictus Games community can be isolating due to the lack of infrastructure for people with physical disabilities. &quot;You just become homebound,&quot; Odainyk said, describing the days when he uses a wheelchair in his city of Kamianets-Podilskyi, which has a population of 109,000 people. In 2021, the government approved the National Strategy for Creating Barrier-Free Space until 2030, which, among other things, aims to make the infrastructure of Ukrainian cities more accessible to people with limited mobility. The strategy is moving in small steps but still lags far behind the increase of people with disabilities due to the war. Members of the Ukrainian team of the Invictus Games, Viktor Dykyi (L) and Illia Pylypenko (R), in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Ukraine on Jan. 11-16, 2025. (Invictus Games: Team Ukraine)&quot;People do not understand the needs of soldiers returning from the front line. They do not want to understand,&quot; Odainyk added. &quot;There is a feeling that the state has used you, and then, you are no longer needed because you are different.&quot; Following his comeback from the Invictus Games, Odainyk wants to make his city community more friendly and comfortable for those returning from service. &quot;We are not from outer space; we are ordinary citizens,&quot; he said. Ukraine will participate in the Invictus Games for the fifth time. In 2024, a record 329 veterans and service members participated in the national selection process for this year&apos;s games. But the broader public still does not know much about this project, said Ilona Voloshyna, national coordinator of the Invictus Games. &quot;Veterans are the backbone of our human capital today. In the future, every second person in their family will have someone who served in the war,&quot; Voloshyna told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Of course, we want more people to know about the Games. Unfortunately, even when we visit rehabilitation centers, not all veterans know that they can participate.&quot; Caring for veterans and military families indicates how the state treats its army, Voloshyna said. If other soldiers currently serving in the military see service people and veterans being taken care of, they understand: &quot;Okay, if something happens to me, I will be supported,&quot; she added. &quot;One of the participants of the national selection wrote to us in the feedback: &apos;For the first time, I felt needed not only as a soldier but a veteran in my state.&apos; Before that, he believed that he was just used material.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/i-felt-needed-how-the-invictus-games-help-wounded-ukrainian-veterans-adapt-to-life-after-war/	2025-01-26T08:23:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/upd_P1149514.jpg
The week ahead: Key developments impacting global politics & markets	Editor&apos;s note: This article is an on-site version of KI Insights&apos; The Week Ahead newsletter covering events from Jan. 27-Feb. 2. Sign up here to start your week with an agenda of Ukraine-related events, delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday. The 9-year terms of three Constitutional Court judges will expire at the end of January. Failure to convene a quorum may force the Court to temporarily cease its activities. Ukraine&apos;s Constitutional Court has 18 judges, with 6 appointed by the President, Parliament and Judges Convention respectively. Two of the departing judges, Volodymyr Moisyk and Viktor Kolisnyk, are part of the president&#x2019;s quota; Viktor Kryvenko was appointed from the judges&apos; convention quota. If these vacancies are not filled promptly, the Court will be unable to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities. Currently, 4 seats are vacant &#x2013; 12 judges are needed to conduct constitutional proceedings (of interest, ex-head of the court Oleksandr Tupytskyi is on an international wanted list). On Jan. 27, the Foreign Affairs Council of the Council of the European Union will convene, looking to tackle pressing geopolitical issues, including Russia&#x2019;s ongoing war in Ukraine, with Ukraine&#x2019;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha attending via video call. Discussions will extend to EU-US relations, Middle East dynamics, and the latest developments in Moldova and Georgia. The ministers will likely address the renewal of sanctions on Russia, currently stalled by Hungarian PM Viktor Orban. The sanctions, set to expire on Jan. 31, require unanimous approval from all 27 member states. Orban has criticized the measure, claiming they harm the EU&#x2019;s economy, and previously suggested delaying the decision until after Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration. However, Trump recently indicated a willingness to impose additional sanctions on Russia if Putin does not engage in negotiations over Ukraine, signaling no immediate policy shift. EU ambassadors are meeting to seek consensus, but if no agreement is reached, the issue will escalate to the foreign ministers&#x2019; meeting. Diplomats warn there is no contingency plan if Orban continues blocking the renewal. The EU remains hopeful for a resolution this week to avoid further delays or disruptions to its sanctions policy. Later in the week, an informal meeting of justice and home affairs ministers will occur in Warsaw on Jan. 30 and run until Jan. 31. Discussions will offer a platform for Ukraine to strengthen ties with member states and seek support for its integration into the EU.

Russia launched over 1,250 bombs, 750 drones at Ukraine during Trump's first week in office	Russia fired 1,250 aerial bombs, over 750 attack drones, and 20 missiles at Ukraine in the last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan 26. The attacks targeted Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv, Donetsk, Kherson, Sumy, Kharkiv, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts. One of the worst attacks of the week killed at least one person and injured 45 in Zaporizhzhia after Russian forces pummeled the city with drones and missiles, hitting apartment blocks. Overnight on Jan. 25-26, Russian troops launched 72 drones. Ukraine&#x2019;s air defense downed 50, said the Air Force. &#x201C;Long-range capabilities are crucial. Sanctions are essential. Lowering the price of oil is important. The key is to act in unity and protect lives with resolve,&#x201D; Zelensky wrote on social media. In one of his first address since taking office, President Donald Trump threatened to leverage sanctions against Moscow as well as tackle oil prices that keep Russia&#x2019;s economy afloat. During his speech to the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos on Jan. 23, Trump said that lowering oil prices would end Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine &#x201C;immediately.&#x201D; He said he would ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to decrease oil prices. He&#x2019;s also pushed for ramped-up drilling for U.S. oil and gas which could also undermine Russia&#x2019;s fuel sector. A day before the WEF, Trump said that if a &quot;deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine was not reached soon, he would have no choice but to &quot;put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launched-over-1-250-bombs-750-drones-at-ukraine-during-trumps-first-week-in-office/	2025-01-26T07:45:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/air-defenses.jpg
Transfer of Air Force personnel to infantry continues despite scandal	The Ukrainian military command&apos;s plan to throw high-skilled Air Force personnel into the infantry was said to be halted when the practice gained nationwide attention, followed by a condemnation from the president. Soldiers, who spoke to the Kyiv Independent on conditions of anonymity, say, however, that nothing has changed, and the transfers are set to continue. Uninterrupted by the public attention that condemned &quot;a wasteful&quot; use of specialist troops, the Air Force leadership &#x2014; obeying the higher military command&apos;s orders &#x2014; is set to continue sending more of its men to infantry in waves, according to three different servicemen who spoke on the condition of anonymity. One Air Force officer confirmed that the transfer would continue due to poor mobilization results but said he could not officially reveal the figure due to the topic&apos;s sensitivity. Such transfers can have &quot;detrimental effects,&quot; he added, with some specialized troops, for example, providing aviation engineering services, supplying oxygen to aircraft, and replacing batteries. The transfer of about 5,000 to 6,000 servicemen from the Air Force to the Ground Forces began this January, though it&apos;s possible that about half of them would be moved next year, according to Ruslan Gorbenko, a lawmaker from the ruling Servant of the People. Another couple of thousand had already been transferred from the Air Force to the infantry since the beginning of the full-scale war, two Air Force servicemen said. Gorbenko, who is a deputy chairman of the parliament&apos;s Committee on Human Rights, told the Kyiv Independent that the transfer concerns the Air Force servicemen from rifle units who have experience shooting down aerial targets with firearms and are unconnected to aviation. The comment goes against the Jan. 14 video in which the aviation and technical personnel, who say that they have been fulfilling missions on Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets for over a decade, state they received an order to send &quot;almost all technicians to the infantry.&quot; Faced with heavy losses among battle-torn units, the Ukrainian military has been transferring specialized troops &#x2014; such as artillerymen, drone pilots, medics, and sappers &#x2014; to replenish the infantry, often causing a shortage in the now forcibly depleted units. On Jan. 14, a video featuring about a dozen Air Force servicemen surfaced online. In it, one reads aloud a message about what the group describes as &quot;a real challenge&quot; that could &quot;destroy the very foundation of our aviation.&quot; The Ukrainian military command was trying to transfer 218 specialists crucial for maintaining Ukraine&apos;s air fleet to the infantry when the video was released, adding to the 250 that were previously transferred, according to the speaker. The video prompted Ukrainian authorities to reassure the public that there are no such plans and specialists critical to aviation, air defense, and mobile fire units downing drones will remain untouched. An Air Force serviceman, who spoke on condition of anonymity fearing repercussions, said this week that about 120 servicemen from his brigade had been transferred to the infantry since January, which included signalmen, machine gunners, radio operators and those working with cryptographic equipment. The serviceman said he is worried that the transfer could leave Ukraine&apos;s air defense vulnerable, given some specialists tasked with detecting aerial targets, for example, were immediately thrown to the front line.

(Genya Savilov / AFP via Getty Images)He added that the command was sending recently mobilized troops in 2024 from the Air Force to infantry, but now specialists with years of experience are also increasingly being targeted. It would be &quot;a lot more difficult&quot; to defend the sky, this &quot;threatens the well-coordinated mechanism,&quot; he stressed. He estimated that over 1,000 Air Force servicemen nationwide had already been transferred to the infantry, but the number remains difficult to calculate as it is kept secret by the military command. Gorbenko said he was not familiar with the number of soldiers already transferred or which units they ended up in. &quot;Nothing has changed at all,&quot; the Air Force serviceman said from his base, where he says his comrades are randomly being sent one by one to the infantry &#x2014; with the main criteria being men in good health who don&apos;t have a right to be demobilized. Gorbenko believes that the transfer of men from the Air Force&apos;s rifle units makes sense because their job to shoot down the drones is becoming less necessary with the arrival of superior Western-provided air defense systems that do it more effectively. He explained that if these Air Force servicemen could shoot well, they would be helpful on the front line to alleviate the pressure there. The scandal emerged as Ukraine continued to struggle to replenish its battered infantry units following heavy losses. In a desperate bid to cover the losses, the Ukrainian military has often transferred troops from other units, such as artillery, tech personnel, drone operators, sappers, and medics, into the infantry in an attempt to hold on the front line in Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk Oblast. While the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces claimed on Jan. 14 that there were no plans to increase &quot;the acute shortage of specialists of the Air Force&apos;s engineering and aviation service who maintain aircraft to infantry units,&quot; it acknowledged that &quot;many areas lack infantry.&quot; It added that it is &quot;a necessary step&quot; to strengthen defense by reinforcing combat brigades with soldiers from other branches of the Armed Forces. The Air Force serviceman and the lawmaker&apos;s comments come after Ukrainian online newspaper Ukrainska Pravda reported, citing an anonymous senior Air Force officer, that Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi issued an order on Jan. 11 to transfer over 5,000 Air Force personnel to Ground Forces units. In an interview with Ukrainian TSN news program on Jan. 19, Syrskyi admitted that there is a need to cover the gaps among mechanized brigades. But he stressed that there is an order prohibiting the transfer of irreplaceable highly qualified personnel who have undergone training and who specialize in aircraft maintenance.

(Sameer Al-Doumy / AFP / Getty Images)&quot;Mobilization capabilities, unfortunately, do not cover this need (to replenish the battle-torn mechanized brigades),&quot; Syrskyi said during the interview. The reality of soldiers who transferred from one profession to another without any preparation is gruesome, as painted by their surviving comrades. The Air Force serviceman who spoke to the Kyiv Independent estimated that among the guys transferred to the infantry, about 40 percent were killed, and 40 percent were wounded in the first days if directly sent to the front, while some are still fighting. But, Gorbenko suggested that the casualty rate among the new recruits fighting for the first time is much higher than that of the Air Force personnel familiar with firearms that are being sent to mechanized or motorized brigades. Ukrainian and Western military experts were split in their opinions, with some arguing how the deep-rooted resource management issues are leading to the loss of experienced personnel, while others reiterate that some skills are less needed due to the modernization of equipment. The Air Force serviceman, who himself doesn&apos;t weigh the risks of being sent to the infantry because of his commander role, told the Kyiv Independent that they are ready to be sent to the infantry if needed, as long as enough time is given for them to gain the necessary training and for the command to find someone to replace them. The issue, he said, is that it takes necessary skills to replace the Air Force team that maintains aircraft, tracks aerial targets and shoots down drones.	https://kyivindependent.com/transfer-of-air-force-personnel-to-infantry-continues-despite-scandal/	2025-01-26T06:38:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1677406767.jpg
Ukrainian troops avoid encirclement in Velyka Novosilka, military says	Ukrainian troops avoided encirclement as Russian forces are poised to capture Velyka Novosilka, Donetsk Oblast, said the 110th Separate Mechanised Brigade. Ukrainian troops successfully withdrew from some areas to avoid being encircled but fighting is ongoing around the village, which lies around 15 kilometers east of the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. &#xA0; Equipment on both sides wears thin but Russian infantry vastly outnumbers the Ukrainian side, the brigade wrote on its Telegram channel. While Russian troops will likely capture the village soon, they will struggle to advance their offensive onward. The Mokri Yaly River creates an obstacle for Russia&#x2019;s advance and Russian troops are in a vulnerable &#x201C;fire pocket,&#x201D; said the brigade. &#x201C;Any movement is suppressed by shells and drones,&quot; said the brigade. The river also hindered supply routes to the Ukrainians. On Jan 23, Military spokesperson Viktor Trehubov warned that Ukrainian troops were at risk of encirclement. Russian forces are attempting to take control of access routes to the village through heavy fire, Trehubov noted. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 24 that its troops had planted a Russian flag in the center of Velyka Novosilka and that they had split the town in two, cutting off Ukrainian forces. The southern pocket fell most recently. Experts told the Kyiv Independent that Ukrainian troops were likely holding onto the village&apos;s northwestern areas and Russia expected to complete the capture in &#x201C;days.&#x201D; If they do, it will be Russia&#x2019;s first notable win this year. It is unclear how many Ukrainian troops were trapped inside the southern pocket in Velyka Novosilka, but it could be around two or three battalions, according to Pasi Paroinen at the Finland-based open-source intelligence organization Black Bird Group. The number of soldiers is probably around several hundred, he added. Fighting is at a very heavy level in Donetsk Oblast and Russian troops continue to advance, albeit slowly, this year. &#x200B;&#x200B;Throughout the fall of 2024, Russian forces made operational gains in southern Donetsk Oblast, including areas near Toretsk and Chasiv Yar, while advancing near Kupiansk and on Russian soil in Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-troops-avoid-encirclement-in-velyka-novosilka-say-brigade/	2025-01-26T05:37:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screen-Shot-2025-01-26-at-15_09_45.png
Russia bombs itself with 'smart bomb,' Astra reports	Russia dropped a &#x201C;smart bomb&#x201D; on itself in Belgorod Oblast, the Astra Telegram channel reported on Jan 26.The bomb, a UMPB-250, was found in a village in the Russian region but there were no casualties or damage. The UMPB-250 uses the same warhead as a Soviet-era FAB-250 but is designed to be &#x201C;smart&#x201D; and &#x201C;glide&#x201D; with a navigation module integrated with steering, antennas, and a turbojet power unit. Russia has frequently dropped bombs on its territory or the occupied territories in Ukraine. ASTRA counted 165 self-inflicted FAB bombs in 2024 as well as 13 this year. Moscow alters and upgrades its Soviet-era bombs to overcome Ukraine&#x2019;s defenses and increase accuracy. It uses glide bombs, particularly in relentless attacks on Kharkiv Oblast next to the Belgorod Oblast border, which are FAB weapons upgraded with a Unified Gliding and Correction Module (UMPK), allowing it to glide to its target. Russian forces are also improving the electronic systems for satellite navigation. The bombs are often equipped with Kometa antennas to stabilize communication signals and are more impervious to electronic warfare interference.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-bombs-itself-with-smart-bomb/	2025-01-26T03:36:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2086820870.jpg
Potential encirclement in Velyka Novosilka prompts questions about last-ditch withdrawal strategy	Thrusting forward with their vast manpower advantage, Russian troops are gradually penetrating Ukrainian defenses on the western edge of Donetsk Oblast and are close to capturing Velyka Novosilka. Located about 15 kilometers east of the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, the vital road-junction village was once home to around 5,000 people. It is now facing a similar fate to other Donbas strongholds, where Ukraine&apos;s delayed withdrawals resulted in avoidable casualties, according to military experts. Russian troops appear to have cut into the center of Velyka Novosilka, likely dividing the town into two and trapping Ukrainian troops in the south, according to Pasi Paroinen at the Finland-based open-source intelligence organization Black Bird Group. Paroinen said on Jan. 25 that the southern pocket appears to have just fallen, with Ukrainians likely holding onto Velyka Novosilka&#x2019;s northwestern areas and Russia expected to complete the capture in &#x201C;days.&#x201D; The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Jan. 24 that its troops had planted a Russian flag in the center of Velyka Novosilka and that they had split the town in two, cutting off Ukrainian forces. It is unclear how many Ukrainian troops were trapped inside the southern pocket in Velyka Novosilka, but it could be around two or three battalions, Paroinen said. He added that, given the dire manpower situation in Ukraine, these battalions were likely depleted, with only a few hundred troops remaining in total. &#x201C;The question is if it&apos;s closer to a thousand or closer to a few hundred, and considering how bad the manpower situation is, it&apos;s probably going to be closer to several hundred,&#x201D; Paroinen told the Kyiv Independent, adding that it is &#x201C;purely a rough estimate&#x201D; due to the lack of official information. &#xA0; Ukrainian soldiers of the 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade operate a 155mm American Paladin self-propelled howitzer in the direction of Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk Oblast on Jan. 21, 2025. (Wolfgang Schwan/Anadolu via Getty Images)Ukrainian military spokesman Viktor Trehubov said on Jan. 23 that the risk of encirclement persists for Ukrainian troops in the Velyka Novosilka area, as Russia is attempting to cut off routes into the town with heavy fire. He claimed that Ukraine&#x2019;s military has the situation under control and is working to prevent encirclement. &quot;Velyka Novosilka is currently in a difficult situation,&quot; Trehubov said on television, acknowledging that the town&apos;s topography, such as the narrow Mokri Yaly River, further complicates the defense. As Ukraine tries to hold onto the Donetsk Oblast strongholds, no matter how close Russian troops are to capturing them, more Ukrainian soldiers and Western experts are raising concerns about the cost of such decisions. Similarly to the situation unfolding in Velyka Novosilka, exhausted Ukrainian troops defending the town of Avdiivka &#x2014; located just outside Russian-occupied Donetsk &#x2014; were left behind in and around the town, multiple surviving soldiers told the Kyiv Independent in February 2024. Two soldiers from the 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade, which is currently defending Velyka Novosilka and facing a similar fate, have recounted how they had to leave behind dozens of their wounded comrades in order to increase their own chances of survival. If Russia captures Velyka Novosilka, it will be its first notable victory in 2025.

(Roman Chop/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Russian troops have been on the offensive for more than a year, capturing long-time Ukrainian strongholds in Donetsk Oblast, including Avdiivka, Vuhledar, Selydove, and Kurakhove in 2024. Elsewhere on the front line, Russian troops are gradually pushing Ukrainian forces out of the salient that they control in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. Meanwhile, the city of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast is facing another Russian offensive. Russia&#x2019;s imminent seizure of Velyka Novosilka comes about a year and a half after Ukraine began a counteroffensive in the summer of 2023, when it tried to liberate villages along the Mokri Yaly River. The furthest they advanced was to the village of Urozhaine, about 10 kilometers south of Velyka Novosilka. Now the picture is entirely different, with Russia reclaiming all the villages and threatening to advance further. Velyka Novosilka&#x2019;s fall could impact the situation in Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts, as only open fields lie beyond the village, according to Serhiy Hrabskyi, a retired Ukrainian colonel and military analyst. But he stressed that it took a long time for Russia to finally come close to capturing Velyka Novosilka, and that holding onto the village makes sense because it is exhausting Moscow&apos;s resources that could be used elsewhere. &#x201C;(Russian troops) are attacking only on one relatively narrow front line, this is the price of holding on,&#x201D; Hrabskyi told the Kyiv Independent.

(Genya SAVILOV / AFP) (Photo by GENYA SAVILOV/AFP via Getty Images)Russia has captured Vremivka, a village just southwest of Velyka Novosilka and then Novyi Komar, a village to its north, gradually cutting off supply routes for Ukrainian troops, Hrabskyi said. He stressed that the sharp contrast in manpower leverage has allowed Moscow to gradually advance despite the cost, and that it is &#x201C;impossible&#x201D; to prevent it. Russian tactics remain unchanged, relying on the continuous deployment of small groups of five to seven assault soldiers until enough troops are gathered to properly advance on a nearby Ukrainian position. They accumulate 20, 30, or even 50 people for certain positions, and it can last for weeks &#x2014; then this group moves forward,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Imagine being two people in a trench with 50 Russian soldiers storming toward you.&quot; Ukrainian troops should withdraw earlier to prevent encirclements, Paroinen from Black Bird Group said. He called the situation in Velyka Novosilka &#x201C;a completely self-inflicted situation&#x201D; caused by Ukrainian mismanagement. Either Ukraine&apos;s top military leadership is unable to comprehend the brutal reality on the ground, or it is &#x201C;way too slow at making these difficult decisions, like, for example, giving up a village,&quot; he said. &#x201C;This situation could have been foreseen for months,&#x201D; Paroinen argued, stressing that the Russian advance had slowed down for the past two months, possibly due to winter weather conditions or potential resource exhaustion. &#x201C;The situation has already been such for a week or so, ever since the Russians got into Vremivka,&#x201D; he added in reference to the potential encirclement. &#x201C;At that point, it was a done deal.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/potential-encirclement-in-velyka-novosilka-prompts-questions-about-last-ditch-withdrawal-strategy/	2025-01-26T01:53:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194550187.jpg

Donetsk Oblast to forcibly evacuate children from over 20 settlements	Authorities in Donetsk Oblast have decided to begin forcible evacuations of families with children in over 20 settlements in the region due to increased Russian shelling, Governor Vadim Filashkin announced on Jan. 24. Officials intensified civilian evacuations in Donetsk Oblast during the summer and autumn as Russian forces ramped up their offensive in eastern Ukraine. Despite these efforts, around 307,000 civilians reportedly remained in Ukrainian-controlled parts of the region as of early January. Due to the increased threat to civilian lives, Donetsk Oblast will begin mandatory forced evacuations of families with children in several settlements in the Komar and Kryvorizhzhia communities, Filashkin said. The evacuation order affects over 100 children. According to the governor, 76 children currently remain in the Komar area and 34 in Kryvorizhzhia. &quot;Now that the enemy has intensified shelling of Donetsk Oblast, people are suffering and dying every day, I ask parents to be very responsible about the evacuation,&quot; Filashkin wrote. &quot;Children should live in peace and tranquility, not hide from shelling!&quot; Some of the settlements under the evacuation mandate are less than 15 kilometers (9 miles) from the embattled city of Pokrovsk, one of the focal points of Russia&apos;s eastern offensive.	https://kyivindependent.com/donetsk-oblast-to-forcibly-evacuate-children-from-over-20-settlements/	2025-01-25T20:41:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2181224530.jpg
Ukrainian sailors return home from Houthi captivity	Three Ukrainian sailors held captive by Houthi militants for 14 months returned to Ukraine on Jan. 25, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) reported. The Yemeni rebel group captured the Galaxy Leader commercial vessel and detained its crew members in November 2023 as part of attacks on ships sailing through the Red Sea corridor. HUR and the Foreign Ministry announced the Ukrainians&apos; release on Jan. 23. The three sailors arrived in Odesa on Jan. 25, where they were greeted by relatives, the Foreign Ministry said in a Facebook post. A video of the return shows the sailors&apos; emotional reunion with their families. &quot;What happened today is the result of the well-coordinated long-term work of a large number of people,&quot; said Olha Mosyondz, a HUR representative. &quot;The special operation was implemented on the instructions of the President of Ukraine and thanks to the full support of the Royal Office of the Sultanate of Oman.&quot; Ukraine has led talks on the release of its citizens since the vessel was captured. The decision to release the sailors came as part of regional de-escalation efforts in the wake of the ceasefire in Gaza. The Galaxy Leader&apos;s multinational crew of 25 included sailors from Romania, Mexico, Bulgaria, and the Philippines. Authorities in the Philippines and Bulgaria have also confirmed the release of their citizens. The Houthis claimed they had captured the Bahamas-flagged vessel due to its connection to Israel, as the ship is associated with Tel Aviv businessman Abraham Ungar. U.S. President Donald Trump recently designated the Iran-backed Houthi movement as a terrorist group, potentially threatening efforts to de-escalate tensions in the Red Sea.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-sailors-return-home-from-houthi-captivity/	2025-01-25T19:25:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/sailors.png
Trump serious about annexing Greenland, aggressive with Danish PM, FT reports	U.S. President Donald Trump aggressively defended his plans to take over Greenland in a phone wall with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Jan. 24. In the weeks leading up to his inauguration, Trump has publicly floated the idea of a U.S. takeover of Greenland, Canada, and the Panama Canal. In comments to reporters on Jan. 7, he refused to rule out the possibility of using military force to seize Greenland, which he said the U.S. needs for &quot;economic security.&quot; In a 45-minute call that took place a few days before Trump&apos;s inauguration, Trump grew increasingly aggressive and confrontational when Frederiksen said Greenland was not for sale, senior European officials told FT. &quot;It was a cold shower,&quot; one official said. &quot;Before, it was hard to take it seriously. But I do think it is serious, and potentially very dangerous.&quot; Another official described the conversation as &quot;horrendous.&quot; Greenland is an autonomous territory of Denmark, a NATO member state and traditional U.S. ally. The Arctic island houses both Danish and U.S. military bases and has vast reserves of mineral wealth. Frederiksen reportedly told Trump that Denmark was willing to deepen cooperation with the U.S. on military bases and mineral extraction, but these offers did not appease him. &quot;The intent was very clear. They want it. The Danes are now in crisis mode,&quot; one official said. The White House has not commented on the call. The Danish prime minister&apos;s office said it did &quot;not recognize the interpretation of the conversation given by anonymous sources.&quot; Trump&apos;s expansionist ambitions and disregard for state sovereignty carry alarming implications, particularly for Ukraine as it fights to restore its territorial integrity amid Russia&apos;s ongoing invasion. Security analyst Alexander Khara, director of the Center for Defense Strategies in Kyiv, told the Associated Press (AP) earlier in January that Trump&apos;s posturing on Greenland bears echoes of Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s comments about Crimea. Russia illegally annexed and occupied Crimea, an autonomous Ukrainian republic, in 2014. The annexation was widely condemned by most U.N. member nations, including the U.S. Washington imposed sanctions on Russian officials involved in the occupation. A U.S. invasion of Greenland would disrupt the NATO alliance and undermine the Western coalition defending Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty against Russian aggression. &quot;We&apos;re in a time of transition from the old system based on norms and principles, heading to more conflicts, more chaos, and more uncertainty,&quot; Khara said. Russia has said it is monitoring developments regarding Trump and Greenland due to Moscow&apos;s own &quot;strategic interests&quot; in the Arctic region.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-serious-about-annexing-greenland-aggressive-with-danish-pm-ft-reports/	2025-01-25T18:25:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193292445.jpg
Russia's Ryazan oil refinery in flames after reported drone strike	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A fire erupted at Russia&apos;s Ryazan Oil Refinery after a drone strike overnight on Jan. 26, according to Russian media reports. The reported strike comes two nights after the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces (SOS) launched a joint attack against the Ryazan Oil Refinery on Jan. 24. Locals reported sounds of explosions and an attempted drone attack on the refinery shortly before 1 a.m. on Jan. 26, the Russian Telegram news channel Astra said. Ryazan Oblast Governor Pavlo Malkov confirmed that Russian air defense units were repelling a drone attack in the region. Andrii Kovalenko, the counter-disinformation chief at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, posted video to his official Telegram channel purporting to show a fire at the refinery after it was hit by drones. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims at the time of publication. The Ryazan Oil Refinery, one of Russia&apos;s largest, has the capacity to process 17 million metric tons of oil per year. Profits from fossil fuels fund Russia&apos;s war machine and Ukraine considers oil industry facilities to be valid military targets. Ryazan lies roughly 500 kilometers (310 miles) north of Ukraine&apos;s border. Ukrainian forces have targeted the Ryazan facility in previous attacks. An SBU source told the Kyiv Independent that at least three oil depots and a workshop were set ablaze in the Jan. 24 strike. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) also carried out a drone attack on the Ryazan Oil Refinery on May 1, 2024. Kovalenko said on Jan. 24 that the refinery is a key facility in Russia&apos;s military-industrial complex. &quot;The refinery plays an important role in providing fuel for both the civilian and military-industrial complex of Russia,&quot; he said on Telegram. &quot;It produces fuel for military equipment, aviation kerosene, diesel fuel and other types of petroleum products used in tanks, aircraft, ships and other equipment of the Russian Armed Forces.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-ryazan-oil-refinery-in-flames-after-reported-drone-strike/	2025-01-25T16:16:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/ryazan.jpg
Trump fires Defense, State department watchdogs in latest government purge	U.S. President Donald Trump dismissed 15 inspectors general, including those in the Defense and State departments, in a late-night purge on Jan. 24, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Jan. 25. The move is the latest action the new administration has taken in their first week in office to dismiss government officials and replace them with Trump loyalists. The mass firing targeted Cabinet-level U.S. agencies, with the exception of the Homeland Security and Justice departments, the WP reported. The surprise termination violates a federal law passed in 2022 that requires Congress to receive 30 days&apos; notice of any plan to fire a Senate-approved inspector general. &quot;It&apos;s a widespread massacre,&quot; one fired inspector general told the WP. &quot;Whoever Trump puts in now will be viewed as loyalists, and that undermines the entire system.&quot; Inspector generals provide oversight of federal agencies, investigating cases of possible fraud, waste, and abuse of power. Defense Department Inspectors General have played a role in tracking U.S. military aid to Ukraine throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. A delegation of watchdogs from the U.S. Defense and State departments visited Kyiv in 2023 and 2024 to hold meetings with Ukrainian officials. The inspections did not find any evidence of military aid theft in Ukraine. Certain U.S.-supplied defense equipment is subject to enhanced end-use monitoring (EEUM), meaning the items are supposed to be closely tracked. The additional monitoring requirements apply to weapons such as Javelin and Stinger missiles, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM), unmanned aircraft systems, and night vision devices. The firing of independent monitors, including those responsible for tracking military assistance to Ukraine, comes as Trump-appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio issues a 90-day freeze of most foreign aid, including support for Ukraine. Senior State Department diplomats are reportedly seeking an exemption for Ukraine-related programs, while Ukrainian officials have claimed that Rubio&apos;s directive does not apply to military aid. The future of U.S. military support for Ukraine remains uncertain under President Trump, who has promised to negotiate a quick peace deal and pledged to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the war. Trump has also used or threatened sweeping dismissals of government employees to advance his so-called &quot;America First&quot; agenda. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz began &#xA0;a full vetting of the National Security Council (NSC) staff, sending home dozens of officials, including those working with Ukraine. Reuters reported in November 2024 that the Trump team was also preparing lists of mass dismissals at the Pentagon. The purge of the inspectors general occurred on the same day that the U.S. Senate confirmed Trump&apos;s controversial nominee Pete Hegseth as Defense Secretary. According to the WP, Senator Elizabeth Warren asked Hegseth during his hearing if he would preserve the department&apos;s independent inspectors general. &quot;If confirmed, I commit to protecting the DoD IG&apos;s independence,&quot; he replied, according to a document seen by the WP. Hegseth has not commented on the firings. &quot;It&apos;s a purge of independent watchdogs in the middle of the night,&quot; Warren said in a post on X. &quot;Inspectors general are charged with rooting out government waste, fraud, abuse, and preventing misconduct. President Trump is dismantling checks on his power and paving the way for widespread corruption.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-fires-defense-state-department-watchdogs-in-latest-government-purge/	2025-01-25T15:06:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2195072233.jpg
Zelensky believes Trump can end war in Ukraine, must include Kyiv in talks	U.S. President Donald Trump could potentially fulfill his promise to end the war in Ukraine, but only if he involves Kyiv in any discussions, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. While the specifics of a potential agreement under Trump remain unclear, Zelensky emphasized that Russian President Vladimir Putin has no interest in ending the war. Trump&apos;s promise, made during his election campaign, to resolve the war within 24 hours of taking office was vague, and his aides have since indicated that such a resolution could take months. Zelensky insisted that the war could not end unless Ukraine is part of the negotiations: &#xA0;&quot;Otherwise it will not work. Because Russia does not want to end the war, while Ukraine wants to end it.&quot; He also expressed uncertainty about how a deal could materialize, noting that even Trump himself might not fully understand the details. &quot;I believe President Trump himself does not know all the details. Because I would say so much depends on what sort of just peace we can achieve. And whether Putin wants, in principle, to stop the war. I believe he doesn&apos;t want to,&quot; Zelensky said. Despite the lack of clarity, Zelensky believed that Trump genuinely wants to see the war come to an end. He mentioned that the situation, nearing its third anniversary next month, remains complicated, but Trump has recognized the risks of prolonging the war. &quot;He is simply saying this has to end or it will get worse,&quot; Zelensky said of Trump&apos;s stance on the peace process. Trump has indicated a willingness to engage in talks with Putin, contrasting with the Biden administration, which distanced itself from the Russian leader. Zelensky also emphasized the importance of including European allies in future peace talks, especially as Ukraine seeks to join the European Union. &quot;As for what the set-up of the talks will be: Ukraine, I really hope Ukraine will be there, America, Europe and Russia,&quot; Zelensky stated. Both Ukraine submitted its EU membership applications shortly after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, signaling their aspirations for closer ties with the West.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-believes-trump-can-end-war-in-ukraine-but-must-include-kyiv-in-talks/	2025-01-25T14:09:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164821112.jpg
Zelensky offers Ukraine as transit hub for Azerbaijani gas to Europe	President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Jan. 25 that Ukraine is ready to facilitate the transit of gas from Azerbaijan to Europe. Zelensky explained that he discussed this potential arrangement with Azerbaijan&apos;s President Ilham Aliyev during their recent meeting. The president emphasized that Azerbaijan has significant export capacity, with the ability to send up to 25 billion cubic meters of gas, and that Ukraine can provide the necessary infrastructure to transport it, though not Russian gas. &quot;There is gas, there are supply routes from Azerbaijan. The key is having the political will to work for your people, not with Moscow for some shadowy benefit, as some figures in Eastern Europe do, Zelensky said. Zelensky&apos;s remarks followed the suspension of Russian gas flows to Europe through Ukraine earlier this month, which caused dissatisfaction in Slovakia and Hungary, both of which had continued to receive substantial Russian gas deliveries. Zelensky, speaking at a press conference with Moldovan President Maia Sandu, noted that Ukraine was focused on providing quick solutions to the energy crisis in Moldova&apos;s breakaway region of Transnistria, where Russia had also cut off gas supplies. He stressed that Ukraine would not allow Russia to profit from the situation but was willing to support Azerbaijan, Slovakia, and other European countries in this effort. In December, Zelensky firmly rejected any renewal of the gas transit deal with Russia, saying: &quot;We&#x2019;re not going to extend the transit of Russian gas. We won&apos;t allow them to earn additional billions on our blood.&quot; His stance further complicated relations with Hungary, which has been a vocal supporter of Russia and has expressed concern over energy shortages. The issue is expected to be a central topic when EU diplomats meet on Jan. 27 to discuss foreign policy. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has warned that he will veto the renewal of EU sanctions on Russia unless Ukraine agrees to reopen the gas pipeline and allow Central European countries, including Hungary, to import Russian gas.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-offers-ukraine-as-transit-hub-for-azerbaijani-gas-to-europe/	2025-01-25T13:15:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1247343791.jpg
US diplomats push for exemption on Ukraine aid amid 90-day freeze, FT reports	U.S. diplomats are urgently seeking an exemption for Ukraine-related programs from a 90-day foreign aid freeze imposed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, according to documents reviewed by the Financial Times (FT) and sources familiar with the situation. The sweeping directive, which took immediate effect, also includes &quot;stop work&quot; orders on existing projects. Senior diplomats in the State Department&#x2019;s Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs requested a full waiver to exclude U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) operations in Ukraine, citing national security concerns. &quot;We do not know at this time whether this request will be approved &#x2014; in whole or in part &#x2014; but there are positive signals thus far out of Washington,&quot; an email sent to USAID staff in Ukraine on Jan. 25 read, according to the FT. USAID in Ukraine temporarily delayed issuing &quot;stop work&quot; orders to its partners, aiming to provide clarity while assessing how programs align with Rubio&#x2019;s directive to make the U.S. &quot;safer, stronger, and more prosperous.&quot; Despite this, by the evening of Jan. 25 in Kyiv, some organizations began receiving official &quot;stop work&quot; orders, halting operations until further notice from contracting officers. The freeze has left hundreds of foreign aid contracts, valued at over $70 billion in the 2022 fiscal year, in limbo as a review process unfolds over the next 85 days, according to the FT. Ukrainian officials and NGOs warned that the pause could jeopardize critical initiatives, including support for schools, hospitals, and infrastructure development. Military assistance to Ukraine, which amounts to $65.9 billion since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, remains unaffected by the freeze, a Ukrainian government official confirmed to the outlet. &quot;Military aid to Ukraine is intact,&quot; the official said. &quot;At least as of now, and it is certainly not part of this 90-day freeze.&quot; Rubio&#x2019;s order, however, excludes specific exemptions for Ukraine within non-military programs, unlike the approved waivers for Israel, Egypt, and emergency food aid.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-diplomats-push-for-exemption-on-ukraine-aid-amid-90-day-freeze-ft-reports/	2025-01-25T12:30:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2149305400-1.jpg
Zelensky backs Slovak protests as Fico criticizes opposition, organizers	&quot;Bratislava is not Moscow, Slovakia is Europe,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on X on Jan. 25, voicing support for protests against Slovakia&apos;s government. The demonstrations, held under the slogan &quot;Slovakia is Europe,&quot; swept across 30 cities on Jan. 24. Around 100,000 people nationwide chanted slogans like &quot;Enough of Fico&quot; and &quot;We are Europe,&quot; voicing opposition to Prime Minister Robert Fico&apos;s policies and pro-Russian stance, Slovak media Aktuality reported. The protests were also sparked by Fico&apos;s visit to Moscow in late December, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2014;a rare trip to the Kremlin by a European Union leader since Russia&apos;s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Fico reportedly criticized Zelensky for supporting protests against Slovakia&apos;s government. According to Aktuality, Fico dismissed Zelensky&#x2019;s comment on X as &quot;laughable&quot; and called it &quot;an inappropriate interference in the internal affairs of the Slovak Republic.&quot; He added that he currently has no plans to meet with Zelensky. Commenting on the protests, Fico accused the organizers of misleading participants and claimed that a third of those attending the demonstrations were allegedly Ukrainians. The Kyiv Independent can&apos;t immediately verify this information. Organized by the &quot;Peace to Ukraine&quot; initiative and opposition parties, the protests drew significant crowds on Jan. 24, including an estimated 60,000 participants in Bratislava&apos;s Freedom Square. Fico, who has been critical of Western support for Ukraine, accused opposition leader Michal Simecka on Jan. 18 of plotting to overthrow the government. Fico based his accusations on a confidential report from the country&#x2019;s intelligence service (SIS), which he presented in parliament last week. In a Facebook address, Fico claimed that Simecka was &quot;kissing Zelensky&#x2019;s ring&quot; and pledging support for Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership. Simecka, leader of the pro-Western Progressive Slovakia party, recently led a delegation of opposition lawmakers to Kyiv on Jan. 17 to reestablish Slovakia&apos;s support for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-backs-slovak-protests-as-fico-criticizes-opposition-organizers/	2025-01-25T11:02:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194890610.jpg
US suspends programs for entry of migrants, including Ukrainians, NYT reports	The U.S. Department of Homeland Security suspended a number of programs that allowed immigrants to temporarily settle in the country, including an initiative for Ukrainians, the New York Times (NYT) reported on Jan. 24. U.S. President Donald Trump previously pledged to impose harsher legislation on migrants and launch the &quot;largest deportation program in U.S. history,&quot; aimed at removing 15 to 20 million migrants from the country. The directive, seen by the NYT, calls for an immediate halt to &quot;final decisions&quot; on applications related to these programs while the administration reviews them and decides whether to terminate them. This decision will block the entry of immigrants fleeing &quot;the most unstable and desperate places in the world,&quot; including Ukraine, Cuba, Haiti, and Venezuela, among others, according to the media. Trump&apos;s administration officials also said that Trump believes that many of these programs were &quot;never lawful to begin with.&quot; Among the wide list of suspended programs is Unite for Ukraine (U4U), a Biden-era initiative that allowed Ukrainian immigrants to temporarily enter the U.S. if they had financial sponsors. Following the inauguration, Trump signed an order suspending the admission of foreigners who seek to &quot;illegally enter the U.S. via the southern border&quot; with Mexico. The Trump administration is planning to launch a large-scale immigration raid on major U.S. cities, according to the Wall Street Journal.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-suspends-programs-for-entry-of-migrants-including-ukrainians/	2025-01-25T08:42:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1996074507.jpg
Parliament committee head calls for defense minister's resignation as defense procurement scandal escalates	Anastasia Radina, head of the Ukrainian parliament&apos;s anti-corruption committee, on Jan. 25 urged Defense Minister Rustem Umerov to resign after he fired Maryna Bezrukova, the head of the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA). At the same time, the DPA and Bezrukova said that Umerov&apos;s decision was null and void, and she remains the legitimate head of the agency. Umerov has been lambasted by pro-reform MPs and anti-corruption activists for what they see as his efforts to destroy the independence of the Defense Procurement Agency, which was created in 2022 to make defense procurement more transparent and crack down on corruption. Anti-corruption watchdogs have also argued that Umerov&apos;s actions jeopardize Western military aid for Ukraine. On Jan. 23, the DPA&apos;s supervisory board unanimously voted for extending its contract with Bezrukova for another year. However, Umerov overruled the board&apos;s decision on Jan. 24, saying that he would not renew Bezrukova&apos;s contract as head of the DPA. He cited allegedly unsatisfactory results as the reason. But the Defense Procurement Agency said in a statement on Jan. 25 that it continues to operate under Bezrukova&apos;s leadership despite Umerov&apos;s statements on her dismissal. &quot;The DPA continues to operate under Maryna Bezrukova&apos;s leadership, as only the supervisory board has the authority to extend or terminate the director&apos;s current contract. This is in line with both the Ukrainian law and the latest version of the agency&apos;s charter,&quot; the agency&apos;s statement read. The agency said the planned appointment of a new agency head was a &quot;direct manifestation of pressure&quot; on the Supervisory Board and an attempt to destroy independent corporate governance. &quot;This is an unprecedented violation of all previous agreements between the Defense Ministry, civil society, and international partners,&quot; the statement read. Radina, head of the parliament&apos;s anti-corruption committee and an MP from President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Servant of the People party, said that Umerov &quot;must submit his resignation&quot; due to the scandal. &quot;The decision (by the board to extend Bezrukova&apos;s contract) turned out to be so independent that it outraged the defense minister,&quot; she said. &quot;... I believe these actions undermine the defense procurement reform and represent direct interference in procurement processes.It doesn&apos;t matter who will be in the &apos;new supervisory board&apos; or who will lead the agencies &#x2014; the minister has clearly shown that these people can be dismissed at any moment with the stroke of a pen.&quot; Radina accused Umerov of violating the law and failing to fulfill procurement contracts. &quot;The defense ministry of a country at war must be led by someone for whom legality, transparency, and accountability are not just empty words,&quot; she added. According to Ukrainian law, supervisory boards have the authority to hire and fire the heads of state enterprises unilaterally. This means that legally, after the board&apos;s vote, Bezrukova should take over the Defense Procurement Agency for another year. However, due to amendments recently made to the agency&apos;s charter by the Defense Ministry, which oversees the DPA, the ministry can reverse the supervisory board&apos;s decisions. Anti-corruption activists and lawmakers say that the amendments and Umerov&#x2019;s decision are &#x201C;unlawful.&#x201D; Following Umerov&apos;s move, the Anti-Corruption Action Center filed a complaint with the country&apos;s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) to open an investigation against Umerov on suspicion of alleged abuse of power. Previously, Bezrukova announced that she would continue to fulfill her duties as head of the DPA. Bezrukova took over the agency in January 2024, and her contract expires at the end of January 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-defense-procurement-agency-continues-to-operate-under-director-previously-dismissed-by-umerov/	2025-01-25T08:28:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/DSC01371.jpg
Zelensky, Sandu say they are ready to meet Transnistria's energy needs	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his Moldovan counterpart Maia Sandu said after their talks in Kyiv on Jan. 25 that they were ready to meet the energy needs of Moldova&apos;s Russian-occupied Transnistria region. Russian natural gas supplies to Transnistria were halted on Jan. 1 due to Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit, including supplies to Moldova, and Moldova&apos;s debt for gas supplies. Earlier on Jan. 25, Sandu arrived in Kyiv on an official visit to meet with Zelensky and discuss several issues, including the energy crisis. Sandu and Zelensky condemned Russia&apos;s decision to halt gas supplies to Transnistria, which has caused a humanitarian crisis. The presidents reaffirmed their commitment and ability to provide &quot;urgent and concrete solutions&quot; to meet the energy needs of the region&apos;s people, prevent further escalation of the crisis, and restore basic services. In their joint statement, Zelensky and Sandu also condemned Russia&apos;s &quot;unprecedented subversive activities and hybrid attacks&quot; against Moldova, recalling the Kremlin&apos;s interference in last year&apos;s presidential election and the referendum on Moldova&apos;s accession to the EU. &quot;These actions demonstrate a clear intention to systematically interfere in democratic processes to destabilize the region and undermine stability in Europe,&quot; the statement read. Russia&apos;s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom halted gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1 as Ukraine ended Russian gas transit through its territory. Gazprom said it had halted supplies because of Moldova&apos;s unpaid debt for gas. Transnistria had been effectively acquiring gas free of charge &#x2014; a political tool that Russia used to keep the region under its control. The breakaway region&apos;s debt for Russian gas amounts to more than $10 billion, according to Moldovagaz, a Gazprom subsidiary. Chisinau&apos;s separate debt for Russian gas supplies totals $709 million, according to Gazprom. However, the Moldovan government recognizes only an $8.6 million debt, citing financial audits. The end of Russian gas supplies via Ukraine has halted all industrial activity in Transnistria, Sergey Obolonik, the first deputy chairman of Transnistria&apos;s self-proclaimed government, said on Jan. 2. Transnistria&apos;s unrecognized government had previously rejected an offer from Chisinau to help purchase gas from Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-sandu-reaffirm-readiness-to-cover-energy-needs-of-russian-controlled-transnistria/	2025-01-25T06:47:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2153384608.jpg
Russia attacks Kharkiv with drones, local authorities report casualties	Russian forces struck the city of Kharkiv with drones on Jan. 25, local authorities reported. Russia targeted the city&apos;s Shevchenkivskyi, Kyivskyi, and Kholodnohirskyi districts, Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov reported. One of the strikes was carried out with a Molniya drone in the Shevchenkivskyi district, causing a fire, according to preliminary data. The attack resulted in civilian casualties and damaged cars. Russian attacks on the city have also disrupted water and electricity supplies in several districts. The damage caused by the strikes and the number of victims are currently being determined. Repeated strikes on the city are possible, Terekhov reported. Located less than 30 kilometers from the Russian border, the northeastern city of Kharkiv has suffered relentless aerial attacks over the past two years of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Moscow often targets densely populated neighborhoods with missiles and glide bombs.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-attacks-kharkiv-with-drones-local-authorities-report-casualties/	2025-01-25T05:35:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2114357693.jpg
US considers buying weapons for Ukraine using frozen Russian assets, Kellogg says	The U.S. government is considering purchasing American weapons for Ukraine with money received from frozen Russian assets, Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s peace envoy for Ukraine and Russia, told Fox News on Jan. 24. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 6 in an interview with Lex Fridman that he had proposed to Trump that Kyiv buy U.S. weapons with frozen Russian assets. He added that this could be &quot;one of the security guarantees.&quot; Zelensky did not specify what Trump&apos;s reaction was. This approach can be part of a comprehensive solution that will support Ukraine in its war against Russia and strengthen the U.S. defense industry, Kellogg said. The idea of directing Russian assets to the needs of Ukrainian defense remains &quot;on the table,&quot; Kellogg added. &quot;We&apos;ve talked about this repeatedly &#x2014; using Russian frozen assets to do that, to buy U.S. arms,&quot; he said. &quot;That is one piece of the puzzle that needs to be discussed, and it&apos;s going to be on the table with the president to talk about. But it&apos;s not the piece that is going to solve it. Still, it&apos;s an interesting point and worth discussing.&quot; While Western countries have frozen $300 billion in Russian assets, they can only access the annual income generated by these funds, approximately $3.2 billion. These profits will back a $50 billion loan to Kyiv, while the vast majority of the assets are frozen in European countries. The European Union recently disbursed &#x20AC;3 billion ($3.09 billion) to Ukraine as part of G7&apos;s $50 billion loan initiative. The EU&apos;s &#x20AC;20 billion ($20.6 billion) contribution to the program is partially funded by income from frozen Russian assets. The U.S. has also contributed $20 billion toward the loan assistance, showcasing a concerted Western effort to support Ukraine financially while leveraging Russian assets.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-exploring-possibility-of-buying-weapons-for-ukraine-using-frozen-russian-assets/	2025-01-25T04:21:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1247741520.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine injure 10 over past day	Russian strikes against Ukraine injured 10 civilians over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 25. Russian forces launched 61 drones from the cities of Bryansk, Kursk, Orel, Millerovo, and Primosk-Akhtarsk, and two Kh-59/69 cruise missiles from the Black Sea at Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Ukraine&apos;s air defense shot down two missiles and 46 drones in Kyiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kherson, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, and Donetsk oblasts, the Air Force said. Fifteen drones were lost allegedly due to electronic warfare countermeasures. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 38 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, over the past day. As a result of the attacks, five people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. In Donetsk Oblast, one person was injured in the town of Pokrovsk due to Russian strikes, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Sumy Oblast, three people were injured in the Myropillia community, and one woman suffered injuries in the Hlukhiv community as a result of FPV (first-person-view) drone attacks, local military administration reported. Russian forces also attacked Cherkasy Oblast with drones, targeting critical infrastructure. Local authorities are assessing the impact of the strikes. The regional center is partially without power due to the attack.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-injure-10-over-past-day/	2025-01-25T03:06:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1489471985.jpg
Moldovan President Sandu arrives in Kyiv to meet Zelensky	Moldovan President Maia Sandu arrived in Kyiv on Jan. 25 on an official visit to meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky, according to her X account. Sandu&apos;s visit comes amid an ongoing energy crisis in Moldova&apos;s Russian-occupied Transnistria region. While Moldova has transitioned to European energy supplies, Transnistria remains heavily reliant on Russian gas. Russian gas supplies to Transnistria were halted on Jan. 1 due to Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit, including supplies to Moldova, and Moldova&apos;s debt for gas supplies. The energy crisis has been labeled by Chisinau as Kremlin blackmail and a threat to national security. &quot;I bring a strong message of support for Ukraine and its people. Their courage secures our peace,&quot; Sandu wrote on X. &quot;We&apos;ll discuss security, energy, infrastructure, trade, and mutual support on the EU path. Moldova remains a reliable neighbor.&quot; As Moldova has shifted toward European integration under Sandu&apos;s leadership, Russia has continued to put pressure on the country. Moldova has sought to combat Russian influence and pressure, banning Russian-affiliated political groups like the U.S.-sanctioned Shor party, outlawing broadcasts of Russian state-run television news, and blocking access to Russian media sites.	https://kyivindependent.com/moldovan-president-sandu-arrives-in-kyiv-to-meet-zelensky/	2025-01-25T01:42:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GiIBpMiX0AAwByZ.jpeg
General Staff: Russia has lost 828,470 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 828,470 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 25. This number includes 1,650 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day.

Pete Hegseth confirmed as US Secretary of Defense in tie-breaking vote	The U.S. Senate confirmed Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense on Jan. 24 in a tie-breaking vote. Hegseth, a combat veteran and former Fox News host, was confirmed with the Senate split 50-50. Vice President JD Vance cast the deciding vote, as three Republicans broke with their party to vote against Hegseth. Republican Senators Mitch McConnell, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins joined the Senate Democrats in opposing the nomination. Hegseth&#x2019;s role will be to lead 1.3 million troops and preside over a $850 billion budget, as well as to hold meetings with U.S. allies, acting as the principal defense policymaker and adviser. The confirmation came despite numerous allegations of misconduct, as well as questions about Hegseth&#x2019;s qualifications to lead the Pentagon. President Donald Trump praised Hegseth&#x2019;s appointment, calling him a &#x201C;great secretary of defense&#x201D; and dismissing the dissent as irrelevant to the &quot;important thing&quot; of securing a win. Hegseth&#x2019;s confirmation completes Trump&#x2019;s top national security team. Hegseth previously served as an infantry captain in the Army National Guard, doing multiple tours of Afghanistan and Iraq. He has previously called for reducing the U.S. commitment to the NATO military alliance and decreasing U.S. spending on foreign assistance. At his confirmation hearing on Jan. 14, he was asked about his position on Ukraine after he did not mention Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion during his opening remarks. &quot;We know who the aggressor is,&quot; Hegseth replied, adding: &quot;We know who the good guy is. We&#x2019;d like to see (the resolution of the war be) as advantageous for the Ukrainians as possible.&quot; &quot;But that war needs to come to an end,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/pete-hegseth-confirmed-as-us-secretary-of-defense-in-tie-breaking-vote/	2025-01-24T21:30:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193430534.jpg
SBU foils Russian missile plot on Ukrainian military institute, arrests cadet collaborating with FSB	An 18-year-old military cadet has been charged with treason for allegedly aiding Russian special services, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) reported on Jan. 24. The cadet, transferred to Lviv Oblast for training, reportedly communicated with a representative of Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB) and provided sensitive information in exchange for monetary rewards. According to the statement, the suspect transmitted data on the locations of military facilities, troop deployments, and the aftermath of shelling in the region. &quot;Law enforcement officers exposed her activities and prevented potential strikes on Ukrainian military positions,&quot; the statement said. She used a mobile messenger to send geolocations of training facilities and barracks, which were relocated from Kharkiv to Lviv following the full-scale invasion. The FSB allegedly planned to evacuate her from Ukraine to Russia via a third country after the completion of her mission. The cadet was detained by the SBU while attempting to send coordinates to the FSB and flee the military institute. During searches, officers seized a mobile phone and a laptop containing evidence of her collaboration. &#x200B;&#x200B;The SBU revealed that the cadet planned to provide the FSB with the geolocations of official university buildings where other cadets, including her classmates, were staying. She is currently being held without bail, and the court has imposed a preventive measure of detention under Article 208 of Ukraine&apos;s Criminal Procedure Code. The pre-trial investigation, conducted by members of the SBU Department in Lviv Oblast, is ongoing. The charges under Part 2 of Article 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine carry a penalty of up to 15 years or life imprisonment, along with confiscation of property.	https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-foils-russian-missile-plot-on-ukrainian-military-institute-arrests-cadet-collaborating-with-fsb/	2025-01-24T20:47:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/sbu.jpeg
Foreign Ministry rejects Slovak PM's unfounded Ukrainian cyberattack claim	The Foreign Ministry denied Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico&apos;s claim that Ukraine is connected to a cyberattack on Slovakia&apos;s national insurance company, according to a statement on the Ministry&#x2019;s website on Jan. 24. &#x201C;We categorically reject the hints of Ukraine&apos;s involvement in the cyberattack against a health insurance company in Slovakia,&#x201D; the statement said. The Ministry also called on Fico to stop portraying Ukraine as an enemy. &#x201C;We once again call on the Prime Minister of Slovakia, Robert Fico, to stop looking for imaginary enemies in Ukraine, which is friendly to Slovakia and the Slovak people.&#x201D; Fico made the allegation during an urgent press conference, offering no evidence to support his claim. Meanwhile, widespread protests against Fico&apos;s government are underway, and the opposition is pushing for a vote of no confidence. Protesters, which erupted in more than 20 cities, chanted slogans like &quot;Enough of Fico&quot; and &quot;We are Europe,&quot; expressing discontent with the prime minister&apos;s policies and pro-Russian rhetoric. The demonstrations drew significant crowds, with organizers claiming 60,000 participants in Bratislava&apos;s Freedom Square.	https://kyivindependent.com/foreign-ministry-rejects-slovak-pms-unfounded-ukrainian-cyberattack-claim/	2025-01-24T19:15:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188638934.jpg
Russia lost over 20,000 units of military equipment since Feb. 24, 2022	The Russian military has lost at least 20,027 units of equipment since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to an analysis by the Oryx project. The majority of these losses&#x2014;15,051 units&#x2014;were destroyed, while 852 were reported as damaged. Russian troops abandoned 1,113 units, and over 3,000 were captured by Ukrainian forces, the report says. Among the destroyed equipment, 3,704 tanks were affected. Of these, 2,635 were destroyed, 534 were captured, and the remainder were either damaged or abandoned. Ukraine has also suffered significant losses, with Oryx estimating 7,609 units of military equipment lost since the invasion began. Oryx compiles its reports based solely on photo and video evidence, meaning the actual losses on both sides are likely much higher. &quot;The amount of equipment destroyed is significantly higher than recorded here,&quot; the report notes. Since the start of Ukraine&#x2019;s incursion into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk region which began in August, the Russian military has reportedly lost over 3,000 pieces of equipment and vehicles, according to the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. The cross-border operation is part of Kyiv&apos;s broader strategy to disrupt Russian logistics and defenses near the border. The reported losses include 104 tanks, 575 armored vehicles, 330 artillery systems, 12 air defense systems, and 12 multiple-launch rocket systems.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-lost-over-20-000-units-of-military-equipment-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-24T16:35:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1247412452.jpg
Zelensky says Putin wants to 'manipulate' Trump amid talk of peace negotiations	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 24 that Russian President Vladimir Putin is attempting to &quot;manipulate&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump. Zelensky&#x2019;s warning came after Putin expressed willingness to engage in talks with Trump and praised the U.S. leader. Kyiv reiterated its opposition to any peace negotiations between Trump and Putin on the nearly three-year war without the involvement of Ukraine and European partners. &quot;He wants to manipulate the desire of the President of the United States of America to achieve peace,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address. &quot;I am confident that no Russian manipulations will succeed anymore.&quot; Earlier on the same day, Putin said that Russia is prepared to hold talks with Trump regarding the war in Ukraine. &quot;Regarding negotiations, we have always said &#x2014; and I want to emphasize this again &#x2014; that we are ready for talks on the Ukrainian issue (Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion),&quot; Putin told reporters. Putin also claimed that Trump&#x2019;s defeat in the 2020 U.S. presidential election contributed to the war in Ukraine. &quot;If Trump&apos;s 2020 victory hadn&apos;t been stolen, there might not have been a crisis in Ukraine,&quot; he said. Putin added that Russia has &quot;never refused contact&quot; with the U.S. administration and described his previous interactions with Trump as &quot;pragmatic and trusting.&quot; The Russian leader also referenced a decree signed by Zelensky in 2022, which declared negotiations with Putin &quot;impossible&quot; following Russia&#x2019;s annexation of four Ukrainian regions. Putin went on to question Kyiv&#x2019;s stance: &quot;How can negotiations be resumed if they are officially banned?&quot; Zelensky&#x2019;s decree came in response to Russia&#x2019;s illegal annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, a move widely condemned as illegitimate by the international community. Despite this, Putin continues to signal interest in engaging with Trump, fueling concerns in Kyiv about potential backchannel discussions that exclude Ukraine and its allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-says-putin-wants-to-manipulate-trump-amid-talk-of-peace-negotiations/	2025-01-24T15:32:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156503093.jpg
Rubio halts most foreign aid, including Ukraine assistance, Politico reports	Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on Jan. 24 new guidance that halts spending on most foreign aid grants for 90 days. This directive, which took State Department officials by surprise, appears to include funding for military assistance to Ukraine, Politico reports. According to a document obtained by the news outlet, the guidance requires staff to issue &quot;stop-work orders&quot; on nearly all &quot;existing foreign assistance awards&quot; and is effective immediately. The Kyiv Independent can&apos;t imemdiately verify this information. Rubio&apos;s guidance goes beyond President Donald Trump&#x2019;s recent executive order, which called for a 90-day pause on foreign aid grants while the secretary reviews them. The president&apos;s order left some ambiguity about whether already appropriated funds or Ukraine aid would be affected, but Rubio&apos;s directive makes it clear that no further actions will be taken to disburse funds for already approved programs, according to current and former officials familiar with the matter. The sweeping nature of the mandate shocked many within the department. &quot;State just totally went nuclear on foreign assistance,&quot; one official told Politico. While the document allows some exceptions&#x2014;such as foreign military financing for Egypt and Israel, emergency food assistance, and &quot;legitimate expenses incurred prior to the date of this&quot; guidance&#x2014;its broad scope leaves room for interpretation. It also states that decisions must remain &quot;consistent with the terms of the relevant award.&quot; Officials believe the halt will affect key allies, including Ukraine, Jordan, and Taiwan. One State Department official and two former Biden administration officials, all speaking anonymously, voiced concerns about the potential impact on these partners. The guidance could expose the U.S. government to lawsuits for unfulfilled contracts if the terms are found to be violated. However, the directive states that decisions regarding the continuation, modification, or termination of programs will follow Rubio&#x2019;s review. The omission of Ukraine aid is particularly concerning for American officials who see supporting Ukraine as essential to defeating Russia. While Republicans, including Trump, have long criticized what they view as wasteful foreign aid under Democratic administrations, Trump has recently intensified his stance on Russia. He has threatened Moscow with sanctions if it does not end its nearly three-year invasion of Ukraine and declared that &quot;Putin bears responsibility for ending the war.&quot; The guidance was reviewed and cleared by several senior State Department officials, including counselor Michael Needham and policy planning director Michael Anton. The department is now tasked with preparing a report within 85 days of the guidance&#x2019;s issuance.	https://kyivindependent.com/rubio-halts-most-foreign-aid-including-ukraine-assistance-politico-reports/	2025-01-24T14:29:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194097519.jpg
US arms exports reach record $318 billion in 2024 driven by Ukraine-related demand	U.S. military equipment sales to foreign governments jumped 29% in 2024, reaching a record $318.7 billion, according to the State Department. Countries ramped up purchases to restock supplies sent to Ukraine and prepare for potential large-scale conflicts. The Biden administration&apos;s final-year figures reinforce expectations of strong performance for U.S. defense manufacturers like Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman. Analysts predict their shares will rise in response to increasing global instability, according to Reuters. During his campaign, now President Donald Trump called on U.S. allies to invest more in their defenses. He proposed raising NATO&#x2019;s defense spending target to 5% of GDP, a significant increase from the current 2% goal&#x2014;a level no NATO member, including the U.S., currently meets. The demand for weaponry has surged due to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, putting pressure on defense contractors to keep up. Governments worldwide are submitting orders to bolster their military stocks, while the U.S. works to replenish its own supplies sent to Kyiv. The State Department described arms sales and transfers as &quot;important U.S. foreign policy tools with potential long-term implications for regional and global security.&quot; Notable 2024 deals included $23 billion in F-16 jets and upgrades for Turkey, $18.8 billion in F-15 fighter jets for Israel, and $2.5 billion in M1A2 Abrams tanks for Romania. Many of these orders contribute to the growing backlog for U.S. defense companies. Future quarters are expected to benefit from orders for hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, Patriot missile interceptors, and armored vehicles. Foreign governments procure U.S. arms through two primary channels: direct commercial sales negotiated with defense companies or foreign military sales coordinated via the U.S. government, often through Defense Department officials at embassies. Both methods require government approval. Direct commercial sales reached $200.8 billion in fiscal 2024, up from $157.5 billion in 2023. Meanwhile, government-facilitated foreign military sales rose to $117.9 billion, compared to $80.9 billion the previous year.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-arms-exports-reach-record-318-billion-in-2024-driven-by-ukraine-related-demand/	2025-01-24T13:16:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1246310076-1674684300r20al.jpg
Ukraine war latest: 'More than 50 explosions’ — Massive drone strike targets Russian refinery, plants	Key developments on Jan. 24: The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and Ukraine&#x2019;s Special Operations Forces (SOS) struck the Ryazan Oil Refinery and the Ryazan Thermal Power Plant in an overnight drone strike on Jan. 24, an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. The attack was later confirmed by the General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces. The news comes as Russia&#x2019;s Defense Ministry reported intercepting 121 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 37 in Bryansk Oblast, 20 in Ryazan Oblast, and 17 in the Kursk and Saratov oblasts each. The refinery, one of Russia&#x2019;s largest, has the capacity of 17 million metric tons of oil per year. At least three oil depots and a workshop were set ablaze, according to the source. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video that purports to show the aftermath of a Ukrainian drone strike against Ryazan, Russia, on Jan. 24, 2025. (SBU source)The statement confirms earlier reports in Russian Telegram channels that the Ryazan Oil Refinery caught fire after a drone attack. &quot;SBU and SOS drones also targeted an oil pumping station at the Ryazan Thermal Power Plant,&quot; the source said, without revealing details on possible consequences. Local residents reported more than 50 explosions, according to the source. Ryazan lies roughly 500 kilometers (310 miles) north of Ukraine&#x2019;s border. Drones also attacked the Kremniy EL microelectronics plant in Russia&apos;s Bryansk and other facilities in the city, the independent Telegram news channel Astra reported, citing Russian Emergencies Ministry sources. It is not immediately clear whether the plant, which produces components for the Russian military, suffered significant damage in the attack. The drone strike also damaged windows and the facade of a building of the Investigative Committee, and the Institute of Management and Business caught fire, according to Astra. Andrii Kovalenko, the counter-disinformation chief at Ukraine&#x2019;s National Security and Defense Council, also reported on the attack against the Kremniy plant. The facility has suspended operations after sustaining hits, Kovalenko claimed, saying that the plant produces microelectronics for Russian air defenses, Iskander missiles, electronic warfare equipment, and drones. This is the third time the plant was hit during the full-scale war, Kovalenko said. The city of Bryansk lies around 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Russia&#x2019;s border with Ukraine. The General Staff also confirmed the attack against the Kremniy plant, without revealing details on possible damage. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. Recent weeks saw Ukraine again intensify long-range strikes against military and industrial facilities in Russia&#x2019;s rear in an effort to undermine Moscow&#x2019;s ability to wage war. The Russian army is, for now, failing to outflank Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast in an attempt to cut off the town&apos;s logistics routes, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces, Viktor Trehubov, said on Jan. 24 on national television. The area near Pokrovsk, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian forces, has been the focus of fierce fighting for months as Russia intensifies its offensive in Donetsk Oblast. Russian forces are trying to bypass Pokrovsk from the north and south, but so far without success, according to the spokesperson. &quot;So far, these attempts have been more or less effectively repelled. They have begun to attack the town more actively with long-range, different types of missiles and FPV (first-person-view) drones,&quot; Trehubov said. &quot;Unfortunately, they are hitting the town, but their plan to surround it is still very far from realization,&quot; he added. The estimated Russian advance in the Pokrovsk sector in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 23, 2025, according to DeepState. Pokrovsk marked by a black symbol. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Trehubov stressed that the Pokrovsk sector of the front line is the primary vector of Russia&apos;s offensive. &quot;This is the main point of concentration of their efforts, and it has been for a long time. There is the largest number of clashes there,&quot; he said. Russian troops are continuing to push on the Lyman, Siversk, Kramatorsk, Toretsk, Pokrovsk and Kurakhove axes, according to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff. Pokrovsk and Kurakhove remain the focal points of the Russian eastern offensive, now in its fifth month. Ukraine previously blew up the No. 3 mine&apos;s shaft in the village of Pishchane near Pokrovsk to prevent Russia from deploying its troops closer to the front-line town, according to The New York Times (NYT) Earlier this month, Metinvest announced it had suspended operations at the Pokrovsk coking coal mine due to worsening security conditions and power outages. The BBC and the independent outlet Mediazona have identified the names of 90,019 Russian soldiers who died during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the BBC reported on Jan. 24. Since the media outlets&apos; last update in mid-January, the names of 1,964 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties. Some 23% of all those killed were military personnel who signed a contract with the Russian Defense Ministry after February 2022. According to the investigation, 17% of the identified soldiers were professional contractors, 17% were convicts who left for the war from prisons, and 12% were conscripts. The media revealed that nine generals and 500 soldiers with the rank of lieutenant colonel and higher were among the killed. As of Jan. 24, the highest casualty rates were among the residents of Bashkortostan, Russia&#x2019;s republic near the Ural Mountains and the homeland of the Bashkir people. Russia&#x2019;s non-Slavic ethnic groups have been overrepresented in its casualty figures in the war with Ukraine. The authorities and media in this region reported a total of 3,932 deaths during the full-scale war, the investigation read. Russia&apos;s real losses are likely higher, as the media analysis is estimated to cover 45% to 65% of the actual death toll, the BBC reported. According to the journalists&#x2019; estimates, the actual losses could range from 138,500 to 200,000 people killed. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 8 that about 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed during the full-scale invasion. The last time Moscow officially announced the number of soldiers killed was in September 2022, putting the number at 5,937. Ukraine&#x2019;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Jan. 19 that Russian forces suffered their heaviest losses last year since the start of the full-scale war, with total military losses reaching 434,000 soldiers killed and injured in 2024. This represents around half of the 800,000 killed and injured Russian soldiers since the start of the full-scale war, according to Ukraine&#x2019;s military. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry dismissed Russia&apos;s demand to cancel NATO&apos;s 2008 promise of eventual membership for Ukraine, calling it &quot;utter bul***it&quot; in a Jan. 24 statement. The response comes after Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko criticized NATO&apos;s 2008 Bucharest Summit declaration, calling it &quot;catastrophic for European security.&quot; &quot;Aw shucks, North Korea&apos;s ally issuing ultimatums to NATO. Utter bul***it,&quot; said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi in response to Grushko&apos;s remarks. &quot;Moscow has no say here.&quot; Instead, the ministry praised NATO&apos;s decision at the time and reiterated Kyiv&apos;s commitment to joining the alliance. &quot;European security architecture is built on protection from Russia,&quot; Tykhyi said. Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022 following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. While NATO members pledged at the 2024 Washington Summit that Ukraine&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; they have yet to extend a formal invitation. Russian officials, as well as Western intellectuals with a track record of anti-Ukraine narratives have repeatedly cited Ukraine&apos;s potential NATO membership as a justification for the invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged opposition from several NATO members, including the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia, but expressed hope that U.S. President Donald Trump could sway support for Kyiv&apos;s entry. There is little evidence that the new administration would be more open to Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership than former U.S. President Joe Biden. Trump has previously criticized NATO and blamed Biden for allegedly supporting Ukraine&apos;s aspirations and provoking Russia&apos;s invasion. U.S. President Donald Trump indicated that both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine&#x2019;s President Volodymyr Zelensky share the blame for the Ukraine-Russia war in an interview segment with Fox News released on Jan. 23. The U.S. president, who most recently met Zelensky in Paris in December, criticized his Ukrainian counterpart for resisting Russia at the start of the invasion instead of cutting a deal. &quot;Zelensky... shouldn&#x2019;t have allowed this to happen either. He&#x2019;s no angel,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I could have made that deal so easily, and Zelensky decided that &apos;I want to fight,&apos;&quot; he commented, adding that Ukraine has been fighting against a &quot;much bigger entity.&quot; At the same time, Trump acknowledged Ukraine&#x2019;s bravery in resisting Russia and said that the Ukrainian president has &quot;had enough&quot; and is ready for peace. &quot;We started pouring equipment... and they (Ukraine) had the bravery to use the equipment, but in the end, it&#x2019;s a war that has to be settled,&quot; Trump said. Already during his electoral campaign, Trump implied that his predecessor, former U.S. President Joe Biden, and Zelensky share blame for Russia&#x2019;s ongoing invasion and pledged to broker a swift peace deal. Trump has been often critical of the Biden administration&#x2019;s support for Ukraine and boasted about good relations with Putin, sparking concerns he might broker a deal unfavorable to Kyiv. Recently, the U.S. president has adopted a more critical stance toward Moscow, criticizing Putin for reluctance to cut a deal and threatening with economic repercussions if he fails to do so. &quot;Putin shouldn&#x2019;t have done it (launching the full-scale invasion)... and it has to stop,&quot; Trump said, claiming that Russia had lost around 850,000 soldiers while Ukraine lost 700,000. Zelensky put Ukraine&#x2019;s casualty rates at 43,000 killed and 370,000 wounded as of December, while Moscow does not reveal its losses. In the interview, Trump reiterated his warnings that if Russia does not agree to negotiate, the U.S. is going to impose &quot;massive tariffs and massive taxes, and... big sanctions,&quot; adding he &quot;doesn&#x2019;t want to do it&quot; because he &quot;loves&quot; Russia. The U.S. president echoed his earlier claims that the full-scale invasion would have never started if he were in office at the time, blaming the Biden administration for supposedly provoking Putin and allowing him to profit from high energy prices. Trump also lashed out against the former president for not pressuring European countries to donate more support to Ukraine, falsely claiming that Washington spent &quot;$200 billion more than Europe&quot; in support of Kyiv. The U.S. Congress has allocated over $170 billion to Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, which included the provision of over $60 billion worth of military support. The EU and its member countries have made available $145 billion in financial, military, and humanitarian assistance during the full-scale war. Ukraine recently announced that arrangements for a meeting between Trump and Zelensky are underway, while the U.S. president also said he aims to meet Putin in the coming days to discuss an end to the war. Moscow welcomed Trump&#x2019;s proposal for a meeting but voiced skepticism about a possible peace deal, saying it has to first understand what the U.S.&#x2019;s goals are before entering into any negotiations. Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters on Jan. 24 that Russia is ready for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump on ending the war in Ukraine. &quot;Regarding negotiations, we have always said &#x2014; and I want to emphasize this again &#x2014; that we are ready for talks on the Ukrainian issue (Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion),&quot; Putin said. Putin claimed that if Trump&apos;s 2020 &quot;victory hadn&apos;t been stolen,&quot; there might not have been a &quot;crisis in Ukraine.&quot; He emphasized that Russia has &quot;never refused contact&quot; with the U.S. administration and maintained a &quot;pragmatic and trusting&quot; relationship with Trump. He moved quickly to point out a decree signed by President Zelensky after Russia illegally annexed four Ukrainian regions, which declared negotiations with Putin &quot;impossible&quot; while leaving the door open to discussions with Russia under different leadership. &quot;How can negotiations be resumed if they are officially banned?&quot; Putin asked. Zelensky&apos;s 2022 decree followed Russia&apos;s annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, actions condemned as illegitimate by the international community. The move reflected Ukraine&apos;s refusal to engage with Moscow while Putin remains in power, underscoring Kyiv&apos;s position that peace negotiations must uphold Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak dismissed Putin&apos;s remarks, accusing him of seeking to sideline Europe in any talks. &quot;Putin wants to negotiate the fate of Europe &#x2014; without Europe,&quot; Yermak said. He added, &quot;Putin has long needed to return to reality himself, or he will be brought back.&quot; Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov echoed Putin&apos;s comments, saying that dialog with Trump could recover if the U.S. &quot;takes into account Russia&apos;s interests.&quot; &quot;If the U.S. under Trump takes Russia&apos;s interests into account, the dialog between Moscow and Washington will be gradually restored; if not, everything will remain as it is,&quot; he said. Lavrov expressed dissatisfaction with Trump&apos;s team&apos;s reported peace proposals on Dec. 29, particularly the idea of freezing hostilities along the current line of contact and transferring the responsibility for countering Russia to Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-more-than-50-explosions-massive-drone-strike-targets-russian-refinery-plants/	2025-01-24T12:02:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/2025-01-24-12_03_42-1.jpeg
‘An opportunity, not a burden:’ Ukraine House Davos’s message for world leaders, investors	Over the last week, Ukraine House Davos opened its doors to world leaders and investors for the sixth year in a row during the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. Ukraine House this year was adorned with the slogan &#x201C;Your Country First, Win With Us.&#x201D; The message set the tone for the discussions from Jan. 20-23, which focused on the benefits Ukraine can offer other countries in return for peace and economic recovery, namely lucrative investment opportunities. Throughout the week, the Ukrainian delegation highlighted Ukraine&#x2019;s estimated $26 trillion in natural resources and minerals, a topic that has picked up amid the return of Donald Trump, inaugurated on the first day of the forum. The new U.S. president has vowed to bring a swift end to the war, which could potentially usher in a wave of investment. The Kyiv Independent spoke with Ulyana Khromyak, Ukraine House&#x2019;s executive Director since 2023, as she wrapped up what she called a packed event. Khromyak said part of the delegation&#x2019;s mission was to convince investors to come to Ukraine now, rather than getting stuck waiting in line after the end of Russia&#x2019;s war. Ukraine&#x2019;s natural resources provide a lot of investment potential, alongside the country&#x2019;s agricultural and defense sectors, she said. Ulyana Khromyak, Ukraine House&#x2019;s executive Director in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 20, 2025. (Ukraine House Davos)Regarding whether Trump will abandon Ukraine in its fight against Russia, Khromyak is hopeful the president can help achieve a sustainable peace in Ukraine and set the country on a path to recovery. &#xA0; This interview has been edited for clarity. Kyiv Independent: What was Ukraine House&apos;s key message and mission this week in Davos? How has this changed from the last few years? &#xA0; Khromyak: For the past three years, the messages were about what is needed to win this war, the opportunities in Ukraine, how Ukraine can contribute to the world, and why Ukraine is valuable to the world. Our message this year was a just and sustainable peace. We had a lot of discussions about how we can achieve this through strength on the battlefield as well as a strengthened position at the negotiation table. The second message was that Ukraine is not a burden, but a country of opportunity. We showed a lot of opportunities, including how rich Ukraine is in mineral resources. We have about $26 trillion in natural resources in Ukraine, out of which $12 trillion is in minerals. We also discussed the successes of the existing investors who are currently working under these (wartime) conditions and also the successes of small and medium businesses. The country is resilient, the economy is working. We talked about investment in the defense sector, which was also a hot topic, to make Ukraine a defense hub. We have the practical experience on the battlefield, as well as the technologies and the knowledge of how to scale this up. Kyiv Independent: Do you think that there is a positive view that President Trump could be beneficial for Ukrainian businesses and its economy? Khromyak: Yes, I truly believe there is. You can see this from his World Economic Forum speech. He delivered strong messages supporting Ukraine. Let&apos;s believe that his political will can help us strengthen these relations and achieve a just and sustainable peace as well as try to start the recovery of the country. Screening of Donald Trump&apos;s speech in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 20, 2025. (Ukraine House Davos)Kyiv Independent: One of the panels differed from the rest in that it focused on Russia&apos;s destruction of Ukrainian churches. Why is this an important message, particularly for Christian Republicans who have not always been supportive of Ukrainian aid? Khromyak: That&apos;s why we raised this topic. We see it&#x2019;s a hot topic for the Republicans, so we try to reflect this. We are saying that Ukraine is a country where we have a lot of religions and it&apos;s one of the most spiritual countries in the world. Different religions are very important to us. Freedom is our religion as well, but we also need to emphasize that we have a lot of (religious) persecution from the Russians. We showed a lot of videos about the persecution of religion in Ukraine. The audience said that this is an important message to the White House. &#xA0; Kyiv Independent: Ukraine House also lent a lot of attention to Ukraine&apos;s investment climate and resilience. What sense do you get from investors about their interest in Ukraine currently? Khromyak: There are a lot of possibilities to develop in innovation, infrastructure, agro-sector, and then definitely the minerals and energy sector. These sectors are very important for the world and Ukraine has all of these resources. We just need to increase their efficiency and therefore we need the investment for this to run independently. There were a lot of discussions about the frozen Russian assets as well; how we can unfreeze and invest them and efficiently use them to strengthen our economy. &#xA0; Kyiv Independent: Do you get a feeling that investors are taking Ukraine seriously as a place to invest? Khromyak: Yes, I do, considering the discussions that we had in the House. We had first Vice Prime Minister and Economics Minister Yulia Svyrydenko speaking, and her deputy was in the House as well, talking about war risk insurance. The government is supporting it from their side and that&apos;s why investors took it seriously. The investors asked a lot of questions about how they could invest, and what would be the security and guarantees provided to them.

(Stefan Wermuth / Bloomberg via Getty Images)Kyiv Independent: Has that changed since you&apos;ve been in your position since 2023? Khromyak: Yes, the interest increased. In 2023, no one knew what was going to happen. But right now, we have President Trump&#x2019;s messages and support from the leaders of the European Union. Right now we have no other option. We have no choice other than to win this war and to make the country stronger. &#xA0; Kyiv Independent: Do you get a sense that investors are willing to come into Ukraine now, or are they still talking about coming in after the war? &#xA0; Khromyak: We were trying to persuade them to come now and show the opportunities because everyone will be queuing after the war. There will be a lot of competition, so first come first serve. They will get better conditions right now, rather than coming after the war. We showed this deal of the year in the telecom sector, (the $1.5 billion Datagroup-Volia-Lifecell merger) saying that, look, the investors are investing and there are a lot of success stories, so please come and invest now. Kyiv Independent: Is there a clearer path now to securing war risk insurance? Khromyak: Yes. We work with Marsh McLennan, who was on the panel, and we had Aon among the audience. These are two main players in the insurance sector who are working with the government right now and with the investment institutions to provide war risk insurance. We have already had the first successes. The speakers discussed how to involve more people and how to make insurance for those who would like to invest now. The Aon and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) transaction that jointly provided insurance to the companies is a good development.

(Hollie Adams / Bloomberg)Kyiv Independent: One of the final panels discussed utilizing the frozen Russian assets. With some Western businesses lobbying against this idea in Europe, how much support do you think this idea has? Khromyak. We need the whole amount of the frozen Russian assets, not just the proceeds. Therefore we need the political will from different countries. A lot of people from the Ukrainian government, opinion leaders, and NGOs on different levels are lobbying for this issue. We are getting there. It&apos;s a long and hard path and a lot of countries still need to implement a lot of internal regulations to pass and transfer these assets. But we systematically need to work on this. The message is that we should not just accept the proceeds, but we need the whole $350 billion.	https://kyivindependent.com/just-and-sustainable-peace-ukraine-houses-message-to-davos-2025/	2025-01-24T11:59:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GV_09911.jpg
Enough of Fico' — Slovaks flood the streets in nationwide anti-government protests	Protests erupted in more than 20 Slovak cities on Jan. 24 under the slogan &quot;Slovakia is Europe,&quot; targeting the government of Prime Minister Robert Fico, Slovak media Aktuality reported. Protesters chanted slogans like &quot;Enough of Fico&quot; and &quot;We are Europe,&quot; expressing discontent with the prime minister&apos;s policies and pro-Russian rhetoric. Organized by the &quot;Peace to Ukraine&quot; initiative and opposition parties, the demonstrations drew significant crowds, with organizers claiming 60,000 participants in Bratislava&apos;s Freedom Square. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these numbers. Fico, who has been critical of Western support for Ukraine, accused opposition leader Michal Simecka on Jan. 18 of plotting to overthrow the government. In a Facebook address, Fico claimed that Simecka was &quot;kissing Zelensky&#x2019;s ring&quot; and pledging support for Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership. Simecka, leader of the pro-Western Progressive Slovakia party, recently led a delegation of opposition lawmakers to Kyiv on Jan. 17 to reestablish Slovakia&apos;s support for Ukraine. Fico likened the opposition&apos;s actions to Ukraine&apos;s EuroMaidan Revolution, alleging they were preparing to stage a coup in Bratislava. Fico&apos;s government has faced criticism for its perceived alignment with Russian interests, contrasting with the pro-Western orientation of opposition leaders like Simecka.	https://kyivindependent.com/enough-of-fico-slovakia-sees-nationwide-protests-against-pm-government/	2025-01-24T11:58:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2195089562.jpg
Ukraine’s weapons procurement clean-up at risk as defense minister moves to undermine reform	Ukraine&#x2019;s lengthy efforts to clean up its weapons procurement are in danger of being unwound as the Defense Ministry strangleholds the Defense Procurement Agency, say anti-corruption activists and lawmakers.Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Jan. 24 that he would not renew the contract of Maryna Bezrukova, the head of the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA), the body in charge of buying weapons for the Ukrainian military. He cited unsatisfactory results as the reason. Umerov&#x2019;s decision comes days after the DPA&#x2019;s supervisory board voted to extend the contract with Bezrukova after a year of reforming in this role. According to Ukrainian law, supervisory boards have the authority to unilaterally hire and fire the heads of state enterprises. This means that legally, after the board&#x2019;s vote, Bezrukova should take the reins of the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) for another year. But due to amendments recently made to the agency&#x2019;s charter by the Defense Ministry, which oversees the DPA, this, or any other decision of the supervisory board could be reversed by the ministry. Anti-corruption activists and lawmakers say that the amendments and Umerov&#x2019;s decision are &#x201C;unlawful.&#x201D; &#x201C;It seems like a violation of legislation, violation of the reform process, and violation of the independence of the agency that was promised personally by the defense minister and his deputies to our society, to our partners,&#x201D; Bezrukova told the Kyiv Independent after Umerov&#x2019;s announcement.&#x201C;Umerov is trying to attack the reform,&#x201D; she added.

(Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)Bezrukova told the Kyiv Independent that she would not leave the agency as she was legally selected by the DPA&#x2019;s supervisory board. &#x201C;I&apos;m not going to surrender. I will stand in my position until the end,&#x201D; she said.&#x201C;I have a vision for the institutional development of the agency. I have over 25 years of experience in procurement,&#x201D; she added. Umerov also removed the board&#x2019;s two state representatives, Taras Chmut and Yuriy Dzhygyr, claiming that they ignored the ministry&#x2019;s recommendation to not extend the contract with Bezrukova. He added that the board will be &#x201C;relaunched&#x201D; in the future, upending nearly a year of work forming the board.Umerov wants to replace Bezrukova with Arsen Zhumadilov, the director of the State Rear Operator (known under its Ukrainian acronym DOT) which buys food and clothes for the military. Previously, Umerov tried to merge the DPA with DOT into one unified body under Zhumadilov&apos;s leadership. Umerov and Zhumadilov are close, sources told the Kyiv Independent. Umerov claimed the reason for the replacement was that DOT delivered better results. Following Umerov&#x2019;s announcement, Ukrainian anti-corruption activists have called for his dismissal, saying that he is disrupting the key reform for wartime Ukraine. &#x201C;These decisions of the minister are a clear sabotage and undermining of the country&apos;s defense capability,&#x201D; Vitaliy Shabunin, the co-founder of the Anti-Corruption Action Center (ANTAC), wrote on Facebook. Additionally, Umerov proposed to fire Deputy Defense Minister Dmytro Klimenkov, who he said &#x201C;failed&#x201D; the task of defense procurement. The ministry set out to reform defense procurement after several high-profile corruption scandals emerged in 2023. Umerov brought Bezrukova on board in January 2024 to lead the transformation of the DPA. Her main goal was to move to direct contracting with weapons producers that cut out middlemen who mark up prices or even fail to deliver on deals. One of the central pieces of the reform was the creation of an independent supervisory board that could protect the agency from political pressure and help ensure fair procurement. However, Bezrukova has locked horns with the ministry multiple times while attempting to change the DPA&#x2019;s practices. In July, the Kyiv Independent reported that she was facing pressure from arms dealers who were unhappy with her reforms. Bezrukova took over the DPA amid reforms in the defense procurement sector which was littered with scandals. Under the agency&#x2019;s previous head, Volodymyr Pikuzo, nearly all defense procurement contracts were through intermediaries, and dodgy contracts cost Ukraine tens of billions of hryvnia, according to Bezrukova, as well as delays of essential battlefield supplies.Bezrukova sees the agency as &#x201C;a platform&#x201D; between the army and defense companies. In the last year, she has secured over 50 direct contracts from 13 countries for ammunition, missiles, radars, drones, and artillery systems under a total annual budget of Hr 306 billion ($7.3 billion). Of the contracts last year, 61% were signed with Ukrainian companies, 27% with foreign companies, including major defense firms like Rheinmetall and KNDS, and 12% with intermediaries. Both the DPA and the DOT, the agency in charge of food and clothes purchases, are performing &#x201C;much better&#x201D; than when the Defense Ministry was in charge of procurement, said Anastasia Radina, lawmaker and head of the parliament&apos;s anti-corruption committee. Bezrukova took the role with the understanding that a supervisory board would be introduced, as is standard practice across state institutions. After facing pressure early on, she hoped the board would protect her, but it took nearly a year into her employment for it to be formed. In the meantime, while the DPA was being overseen by the Defense Ministry, Bezrukova and the ministry repeatedly butted heads. At the start of her job, Bezrukova said Deputy Defense Minister Klimenkov insisted she sign a contract for a large supply of shells despite her concerns about the manufacturer, owned by state defense conglomerate Ukroboronprom. (Editor&#x2019;s Note: The manufacturer&#x2019;s name is not mentioned for security reasons.) Dmytro Klimenkov, deputy defense minister of Ukraine, talks to The Kyiv Independent on Feb. 22, 2024. (Press Service/Defense Ministry of Ukraine) The company&#x2019;s capacities were too limited to produce the proposed 500,000 shells, due to a lack of workers and a gunpowder deficit, Bezrukova said. Additionally, at the time when the contract was being considered in February 2024, the company&#x2019;s director and a manager were under two separate investigations for inflating prices, the National Anti-corruption Bureau (NABU) told the Kyiv Independent.An initial ministry inspection of the manufacturer confirmed Bezrukova&#x2019;s fears, noting that its production capacity was likely around 300-350,000 shells. But a few weeks later, the ministry inspector changed their mind, claiming that the company had enough capacity, according to Bezrukova. Despite concerns, Bezrukova signed the contract.In the summer, the company was behind schedule. Bezrukova told Ukrainska Pravda, a Ukrainian media outlet, that Klimenkov asked her to extend the deadline for deliveries but she refused, insisting they should start looking for alternatives. It was at this point that her relationship with the ministry&#x2019;s top brass went sour, she said. The Kyiv Independent requested a comment from the Defense Ministry but hasn&#x2019;t received a response.By November, the shells were on the front line but many were failing to explode. Around 24,000 duds were withdrawn in December, leaving authorities clambering to find alternatives. On Nov. 26, the Defense Ministry said it was investigating the incident and would deliver imported shells instead.In another more recent clash, the ministry abruptly transferred Hr 23 billion ($546 million) from the DPA&#x2019;s budget to the State Border Guard Service on Nov. 29, without forewarning Bezrukova. The Defense Ministry and Armed Forces General Staff claimed that the DPA had over Hr 100 billion in unused funds that needed to be spent before the end of the year. However, the agency said that this blurred the truth. On Nov. 25, the alleged unused funds consisted of Hr 45 billion available for contracting and Hr 57 billion set aside for pre-agreed contracts. But by Nov. 29, the agency had lined up more contracts for 2025 and the remaining funds dropped to Hr 21.8 billion. That same day, the government adopted the order to redistribute the Hr 23 billion and the DPA had to take Hr 1.2 billion from already concluded contracts to meet it. A furious Bezrukova called for the money to be returned but it hasn&#x2019;t been, according to the DPA.The State Border Guard Service planned to spend the money on a contract with a reportedly dodgy Polish intermediary company PHU Lechmar for mines and shells for the army. The intermediary asked for a 100% prepayment, sounding alarm bells for Bezrukova who says she never pays more than 50% upfront. &#x201C;This is extremely risky,&#x201D; said Bezrukova, adding that if Lechmar fails to deliver on the contract, there is no way to get the money back. Assembling the supervisory board &#x2014; which is now to be &#x201C;relaunched&#x201D; &#x2014; has been a long process, marked by tension between Umerov and Klimenkov on one side, and Bezrukova and anti-corruption activists, supported by Ukraine&#x2019;s Western partners, on the other. The board was supposed to strengthen the agency and defend its head from illicit pressure. While the ministry announced the shortlist of the DPA&#x2019;s supervisory board candidates in June, it took almost six months for the board to come together. Bezrukova sees the delay as a deliberate attempt by the Defense Ministry to undermine the process, or an inability to do its job well. Two board members, Taras Chmut and Kateryna Kuznetsova, told the Kyiv Independent that the process was fraught with bureaucratic hurdles, although they did not find it unusual. Chmut, who leads the Come Back Alive NGO that raises funds and buys weapons for the army, noted that Ukrainian bureaucracy is often a tedious process with endless paperwork. But according to Radina, a lawmaker, the holdup was not justified. While the process was dragging on, Umerov suddenly announced he wanted to merge the DPA with DOT in September 2024. The merger would see one agency dealing with both non-lethal and lethal aid under one supervisory board. Had it been successful, the supervisory board process would have been dragged out again, wasting time and money to rebuild the entire bureaucratic system like the financial budget and workflow. Umerov was trying to &#x201C;destroy&#x201D; the DPA, said Shabunin, the co-founder of the Anti-Corruption Action Center (ANTAC). Instead of Bezrukova, Umerov wanted the director of DOT, Zhumadilov, to head the unified agency as the two men have a closer relationship, several sources told the Kyiv Independent. Vitaly Shabunin, head of the Anti-Corruption Action Center&#x2019;s executive board, speaks at the Ukrainian school of political studies in Kyiv, Ukraine on Sept. 26, 2019. (Ukrainian school of political studies / Facebook)DOT operates with a much smaller budget and staff and doesn&#x2019;t deal with import contracts while the DPA does. Merging the two agencies for them to be led by DOT &#x201C;does not make sense,&#x201D; Shabunin said. &#x201C;It&apos;s a huge difference to buy food, which DOT does, and to buy weapons. The weapons market is much more complicated,&#x201D; he added. Umerov initially said the merger would bring Ukraine in line with NATO standards. However, the plan was swiftly rebuked by the Alliance who backed keeping the two agencies separate. Umerov U-turned on his proposal, saying the two agencies would remain independent during the war. &#x201C;It was not logical,&#x201D; Bezrukova said. &#x201C;In NATO recommendations, it clearly mentions that there are two agencies and that the Defense Ministry should develop and support the capacity of these two agencies, especially of the DPA.&#x201D; Just a day before the supervisory board was finally supposed to be officially formed on Dec. 17, the ministry made amendments to the DPA&#x2019;s charter, undermining its authority. According to Radina, the timing looks suspicious. The ministry also changed DOT&#x2019;s charter but did so months prior. &#x201C;It definitely seems connected to the decision to finally form a supervisory board, to immediately render its powers questionable,&#x201D; she said. Shortly after the ministry&#x2019;s decision, the board members published a statement that the changes &#x201C;restrict the board&apos;s independence and create preconditions for interference in its activities.&#x201D; Bezrukova was keen to stay on at the agency, planning to zero in on the quality and reliability of suppliers. She also hoped to bring the DPA closer in line with NATO agencies and have more autonomy from the Defense Ministry. The supervisory board wanted Bezrukova to stay too. The board voted to extend Bezrukova&#x2019;s contract for another year &#x201C;based on the need to ensure stability and efficiency in procurement management in wartime.&#x201D; Additionally, the board also suggested NATO&#x2019;s auditing board (IBAN) carry out an independent audit. &#x201C;The state must move to transparent rules of the game: purchasing what the army really needs, when it is needed, and at fair prices,&#x201D; Chmut wrote on Facebook after the announcement on Jan. 20. According to the amended DPA charter, the ministry can &#x201C;disagree&#x201D; with the board&#x2019;s decisions and push back.In the long run, Radina is concerned about the broad wording of the amendments, which may allow the ministry to give obligatory orders to the DPA&#x2019;s employees and even intervene in the procurement process, circumventing the agency&#x2019;s leadership and procurement procedures.

Incoming Trump peace envoy suggests oil crackdown to push Russia to negotiate	Stricter measures targeting Russia&apos;s oil industry could pressure the Kremlin to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, incoming peace envoy for U.S. President Donald Trump, told FOX News on Jan. 24. The proposal comes as Trump threatens to impose sanctions and tariffs on Russian exports if no deal to end the war is reached soon. &quot;Russia is earning billions from oil sales,&quot; Kellogg said, emphasizing that battlefield victories alone are unlikely to force Russia to end the war. Kellogg argued that reducing Russia&apos;s oil revenues to $45 per barrel, its breakeven point, could weaken Moscow&apos;s financial resilience and force it to seek a settlement. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed on Jan. 24 that Russia is ready for talks with Trump, whom he described as having a &quot;pragmatic and trusting&quot; relationship with Moscow. Reuters reported on Jan. 23 that Putin is increasingly concerned about the country&apos;s economy, citing five undisclosed sources. Throughout the war, Ukraine&apos;s Western allies have imposed significant sanctions aimed at crippling Russia&apos;s ability to sustain its military aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/incoming-trump-peace-envoy-suggests-oil-crackdown-to-push-russia-to-negotiate/	2025-01-24T10:52:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1242112038.jpg
Ukraine to boost energy resilience with focus on distributed generation, PM says	Ukraine is ramping up efforts to strengthen its energy resilience through the development of distributed generation and increased domestic gas production, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on Jan. 24. The government plans to commission nearly 900 megawatts (MW) of distributed generation facilities this year, part of a broader effort to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s energy sector amid ongoing Russian strikes targeting critical infrastructure. Shmyhal said that in 2024, 233 generating units with a total capacity of over 830 MW were connected, including gas turbines, pistons, and cogeneration units. &quot;In order to strengthen and develop our energy sector, we are also investing in increasing Ukrainian gas production,&quot; he added. Repairs and reconstruction of the Ukrainian energy sector are ongoing, the prime minister added. &quot;About 4 gigawatts (GW) of thermal and hydropower capacity was restored in 2024,&quot; he said, &quot;this year, it is planned to restore about 3 GW more.&quot; Under martial law, the government has exempted energy equipment imports from value-added tax to support the restoration and creation of new distributed generation facilities. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure, including a Jan. 15 attack that targeted facilities at one of the largest natural gas storage sites in Lviv Oblast. President Volodymyr Zelensky noted the timing and intent of the strikes, writing, &quot;It&apos;s the middle of winter, and Russia&apos;s goal remains the same: our energy sector.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-boost-energy-resilience-with-focus-on-distributed-generation-pm-says/	2025-01-24T10:01:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1601918605.jpg
What leverage does Trump have over Putin in peace negotiations? Quite a lot, experts say	Only days after U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House, he dialed up the heat on Russia with a threat of sanctions, tariffs, and negotiating &quot;the hard way&quot; if Russian President Vladimir Putin fails to come to the table for a peace deal with Ukraine. Trump has repeatedly promised to push for a swift peace settlement once in office, prompting fears from some that he might pressure Kyiv towards painful concessions or &#x2014; at worst &#x2014; what would amount to a surrender. His recent comments, however, suggest that Trump could be ready to take a hard line with Russia. &quot;In negotiations, it&#x2019;s about who needs a deal the most,&quot; says Timothy Ash, an associate fellow at the Chatham House&apos;s Russia and Eurasia Program. &quot;I think the leverage is with Trump, not Putin.&quot; Trump has leverage in economic, military, and diplomatic terms &#x2014; &#xA0;the main question is his willingness to use it. Russia&#x2019;s economy is showing signs of weakness, making Putin more vulnerable than ever to additional economic pressure like sanctions. Ramped-up support for Ukraine on the battlefield could add to Russia&#x2019;s mounting losses and further incentivize dealmaking, as would uniting support among allies and squeezing Russia on the diplomatic stage. &quot;A long war doesn&#x2019;t hurt Trump very much. There&apos;s no huge cost to the U.S. economy. No U.S. lives are in danger,&quot; said Ash, adding that a large portion of U.S. military aid has been reinvested in its domestic defense industry. &quot;Trump can carry on, whereas for Putin, it just gets more difficult for him the longer it goes.&quot; The Trump administration is already signaling that sanctions are at the forefront of their negotiating plans with Russia. &quot;If a deal is not reached, I will have no other choice but to put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries,&quot; Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social Jan. 22. Earlier in the month, Bloomberg reported that the administration has begun forming its sanctions strategy and will likely take one of two approaches: offering targeted relief to Russian oil producers to incentivize negotiations or significantly expanding sanctions to ramp up pressure. Sanctions are &quot;the best leverage we have,&quot; said Edward Fishman, a senior research scholar at Columbia University&#x2019;s Center on Global Energy Policy and author of the forthcoming book &quot;Chokepoints: American Power in the Age of Economic Warfare.&quot; While the Group of Seven countries and the previous U.S. administration under President Joe Biden imposed heavy economic sanctions on Russia shortly after the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, they included significant carve-outs aimed at not disrupting the global energy markets. After a contraction in 2022, aggressive defense spending contributed to Russia&#x2019;s economic growth for the past two years, suggesting the effect of the sanctions has reduced after Russia&#x2019;s economy adjusted and discovered workarounds. But Russia&#x2019;s economy is now showing cracks, said Fishman, and, &quot;in the last 10 days of the Biden administration, the U.S. imposed pretty significant sanctions on Russia&apos;s oil and gas sector that meaningfully enhanced the pressure on Russia&apos;s economy.&quot; The last-minute sanctions from the outgoing administration are likely intended to provide Trump with a strong negotiating hand in future talks. The new sanctions close many of the energy loopholes and could reduce Russian oil exports by between half a million and a million barrels per day in the short term. Russian President Vladimir Putin grimaces during his meeting with participants of the Russia International Exhibition-Forum at the All-Russian Exhibition Center in Moscow, Russia, on July 8, 2024. (Contributor / Getty Images)&quot;Russia&#x2019;s economy is not doing very well,&quot; Fishman said, pointing to projections of stalled growth in 2025 and high inflation and interest rates. &quot;Turning up the heat now even more on Russia could really be what we need to get Russia to negotiate.&quot; A powerful sanctions strategy will first require convincing Putin that the U.S. has no plans to reduce current sanctions or enforcement, said Fishman, so Russia can&#x2019;t just wait them out. There are many other sanction targets available to Trump if he wants to up the pressure ahead of negotiations, Fishman also noted. Chief among them would be sanctioning Russia&#x2019;s energy giants Rosneft, Lukoil, and Gazprom, which have so far escaped direct sanctions. Keith Kellogg, Trump&#x2019;s Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia, has said that the administration&#x2019;s goal is to end the war within 100 days. While sanctions are one incentive to negotiate, &quot;their impact is likely not to be truly dangerous for Putin for several more months,&quot; former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John E. Herbst told the Kyiv Independent. In the meantime, Putin has a stronger incentive to seize more territory from Ukraine and try to kick Ukrainian forces out of Kursk before negotiating, Herbst said. &quot;It&#x2019;s a great embarrassment to Putin that Ukraine&apos;s been occupying Kursk for almost six months.&quot; While Russia has gained ground in eastern Ukraine and Kursk Oblast over the past year, it has come at the cost of record troop losses. Ukraine&#x2019;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said earlier this month that Russia&#x2019;s military losses this year will surpass losses from the previous two years combined, and the U.K. has estimated that losses could surpass one million in the next six months. &quot;I think the only way to get Putin to move faster in the short term would be for a new Trump-approved aid package to Ukraine full of weapons,&quot; said Herbst. The package wouldn&#x2019;t need to be a gift, noted Herbst, but could be a loan, or funded by frozen Russian assets or European partners. Alternatively, he said, other countries could purchase weapons for Ukraine, or the Trump administration could push for a transfer of the approximately $300 billion in frozen Russian assets, an option that has been previously discussed.

(Genya Savilov / AFP via Getty Images)&quot;That might force Putin&apos;s hand in the right direction. Although, even then, it&apos;s unclear if Putin&apos;s willing to compromise,&quot; Herbst said. Beyond weapons, supporting Ukraine with non-military financial and humanitarian aid would indirectly help Ukraine on the battlefield, by giving the country more leeway to keep fighting. Regardless of how Trump chooses to wield the military and economic leverage available to him, Trump will need to use diplomacy to bring Putin to the negotiating table and secure a peace deal. Any diplomatic maneuvering will need to not just include Ukraine and Russia but to take their allies into consideration. &quot;First, there needs to be a clear demonstration of unity among Ukraine, Europe, and the United States as to what we&apos;re trying to achieve,&quot; said Thomas Graham, a distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of &quot;Getting Russia Right.&quot; &quot;The less daylight there is between the Ukrainians, the Europeans, and the Americans, the greater leverage that President Trump will have in dealing with Putin.&quot; One way to strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s diplomatic position would be more movement in E.U. accession talks, Graham said. Ukraine would still need additional socioeconomic and political reforms, but it would signal long-term commitment from the West to further integrate Ukraine into a pan-European economic bloc. Demonstrating that the West is prepared to provide security guarantees would send a signal as well, said Graham.

(Sean Gallup / Getty Images)Ukraine is painfully aware of the limits of security guarantees outside of NATO membership or the commitment of NATO troops, following the repeated failure of the Minsk Agreements to contain Russia after its 2014 invasion. Trump has already ruled out offering Ukraine NATO membership, but many countries have signed bilateral security agreements with Ukraine since 2014. Consolidating these piecemeal agreements and providing resources to back up the agreements would be one way to give them more teeth, according to Graham. Finally, said Graham, pressure on Iran and China could further isolate Russia and complicate its international position. Iran&#x2019;s security situation has deteriorated due to the collapse of Syria&#x2019;s Assad regime in December and recent tensions with Israel. Pressure on Iran, one of Russia&#x2019;s most important allies for its war in Ukraine, could force the country to reallocate resources to addressing its own security concerns, rather than supplying Russia. &quot;And,&quot; said Graham, &quot;there are ties and conversations that we can have with the Chinese that will perhaps encourage China to be less supportive of Russia than they have up to this point.&quot; A previous peace proposal that Trump&#x2019;s team described before his inauguration ruled out Ukrainian membership in NATO for at least 20 years. &quot;And that did not impress the Russians. They still trashed Trump&#x2019;s peace initiative,&quot; pointed out former Ambassador Herbst. In contrast, Herbst said, Trump&#x2019;s team has seen President Volodymyr Zelensky signal willingness to compromise on territory, a softening of Ukraine&#x2019;s long-standing position that any peace deal must return all captured land to Ukraine. &quot;At this point, only the Ukrainians are showing some willingness to actually compromise,&quot; he said. But apart from Trump&#x2019;s comments threatening economic pressure, his administration has given little indication of its strategy for negotiations with Russia, all the experts who spoke with the Kyiv Independent noted. &quot;We have very little insight into what the administration is thinking at this point,&quot; explained Graham.	https://kyivindependent.com/what-leverage-does-trump-have-over-putin-in-peace-negotiations/	2025-01-24T09:19:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194071518.jpg
Ukraine reforming recruitment system to attract 18-25-year-olds, senior official says	Ukraine is finalizing reforms to attract 18- to 25-year-olds, currently exempt from mobilization, into enlisting voluntarily into the armed forces, Deputy Head of the President&apos;s Office Pavlo Palisa said to the Associated Press on Jan. 24. Palisa said Ukraine is exploring new recruitment options because the current drafting system, inherited from Soviet times, is outdated and inefficient. The move comes amid pressure from U.S. lawmakers to lower the draft age, though President Volodymyr Zelensky has opposed lowering it to 18, arguing it would harm Ukraine&apos;s future prospects. &quot;We need to adapt the structure to the logic of modern warfare, which will allow us to be more effective and prevent us from making the same mistakes repeatedly,&quot; Palisa said. One key initiative is an &quot;honest contract,&quot; which offers financial incentives, training guarantees, and improved communication between soldiers and commanders. &quot;To secure the unit commander and the contract soldier, establish open and professional relations between them, and set clear boundaries that are understandable to both,&quot; Palisa said. The updates to Ukraine&apos;s mobilization law, adopted in mid-April 2024, simplified the process for identifying eligible conscripts and introduced penalties for draft dodgers. The new legislation also lowered the minimum age of compulsory military service from 27 to 25.

Trump accuses Russia of stealing plans for U.S. hypersonic missile	President Donald Trump has accused Russia of stealing U.S. plans for a hypersonic missile during the administration of President Barack Obama, telling Fox News&apos;s Sean Hannity on Jan.23 that &quot;some bad person gave them the design.&quot; &quot;Russia stole the design, they got it from us,&quot; Trump said, adding the U.S. is developing &quot;super hypersonic missiles... which is even a step better.&quot; Trump offered no evidence to back up his claim, but he previously raised the accusation in 2023, saying Russia had stolen plans for what he described as &quot;super-duper missiles.&quot; The U.S., China, India, and Russia are the only countries to have developed hypersonic missiles, of which Russia&apos;s Zircon is reported to be the fastest. Moscow has previously said the Zircon hypersonic missile entered the arsenal of the Russian army in early 2023, claiming that it has a range of 600&#x2013;1,500 kilometers, can travel at Mach 9, and has a warhead weighing about 300-400 kilograms. Russia has used Zircon missiles &#x2014; originally designed as an anti-ship missile &#x2014; to attack Ukrainian cities, with the first recorded case being in February 2024. The Kremlin has previously denied accusations it stole hypersonic missile technology, insisting they have developed their own. Elsewhere, Trump said that he wanted to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin as soon as possible to end the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported on Jan. 23. Trump also said that he wanted to explore reductions in nuclear arms. &quot;I really would like to be able to meet with President Putin soon to get that war ended,&quot; Trump said via video link, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos. &quot;It&#x2019;s a carnage. And we really have to stop that war.&quot; Later, speaking at the White House, Trump reiterated his readiness to meet Putin immediately. &quot;Every day we don&#x2019;t meet, soldiers are being killed on the battlefield,&quot; he said. Trump also claimed that President Volodymyr Zelensky had told him he was open to considering a deal to end the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-accuses-russia-of-stealing-plans-for-u-s-hypersonic-missile/	2025-01-24T07:39:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2195038636.jpg
Putin claims Russia ready for Ukraine peace talks, questions legitimacy under Zelensky's decree	Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters on Jan. 24 that Russia is ready for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump on ending the war in Ukraine. &quot;Regarding negotiations, we have always said &#x2014; and I want to emphasize this again &#x2014; that we are ready for talks on the Ukrainian issue (Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion),&quot; Putin said. However, Putin moved quickly to point out a decree signed by President Zelensky after Russia illegally annexed four Ukrainian regions, which declared negotiations with Putin &quot;impossible&quot; while leaving the door open to discussions with Russia under different leadership. &quot;How can negotiations be resumed if they are officially banned?&quot; Putin asked. He emphasized that Russia has &quot;never refused contact&quot; with the U.S. administration and maintained a &quot;pragmatic and trusting&quot; relationship with Trump. Zelensky&apos;s 2022 decree followed Russia&apos;s annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, actions condemned as illegitimate by the international community. The move reflected Ukraine&apos;s refusal to engage with Moscow while Putin remains in power, underscoring Kyiv&apos;s position that peace negotiations must uphold Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty and territorial integrity.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-claims-russia-ready-for-ukraine-talks-questions-legitimacy-under-zelenskys-decree/	2025-01-24T07:29:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1572073087.jpg
Utter bulls***' — Ukraine rejects Russia's demand to abandon NATO membership promise	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry dismissed Russia&apos;s demand to cancel NATO&apos;s 2008 promise of eventual membership for Ukraine, calling it &quot;utter bul***it&quot; in a Jan. 24 statement. The response comes after Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko criticized NATO&apos;s 2008 Bucharest Summit declaration, calling it &quot;catastrophic for European security.&quot; &quot;Aw shucks, North Korea&apos;s ally issuing ultimatums to NATO. Utter bul***it,&quot; said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi in response to Grushko&apos;s remarks. &quot;Moscow has no say here.&quot; Instead, the ministry praised NATO&apos;s decision at the time and reiterated Kyiv&apos;s commitment to joining the alliance. &quot;European security architecture is built on protection from Russia,&quot; Tykhyi said. Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022 following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. While NATO members pledged at the 2024 Washington Summit that Ukraine&apos;s path to membership is &quot;irreversible,&quot; they have yet to extend a formal invitation. Russian officials, as well as Western intellectuals with a track record of anti-Ukraine narratives have repeatedly cited Ukraine&apos;s potential NATO membership as a justification for the invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged opposition from several NATO members, including the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia, but expressed hope that U.S. President Donald Trump could sway support for Kyiv&apos;s entry. There is little evidence that the new administration would be more open to Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership than former U.S. President Joe Biden. Trump has previously criticized NATO and blamed Biden for allegedly supporting Ukraine&apos;s aspirations and provoking Russia&apos;s invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/utter-bul-it-ukraine-rejects-russias-demand-to-abandon-nato-membership-promise/	2025-01-24T07:06:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2166614075.jpg
Media investigation identifies over 90,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine	The BBC and the independent outlet Mediazona have identified the names of 90,019 Russian soldiers who died during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the BBC reported on Jan. 24. Since the media outlets&apos; last update in mid-January, the names of 1,964 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties. Some 23% of all those killed were military personnel who signed a contract with the Russian Defense Ministry after February 2022. According to the investigation, 17% of the identified soldiers were professional contractors, 17% were convicts who left for the war from prisons, and 12% were conscripts. The media revealed that nine generals and 500 soldiers with the rank of lieutenant colonel and higher were among the killed. As of Jan. 24, the highest casualty rates were among the residents of Bashkortostan, Russia&#x2019;s republic near the Ural Mountains and the homeland of the Bashkir people. Russia&#x2019;s non-Slavic ethnic groups have been overrepresented in its casualty figures in the war with Ukraine. The authorities and media in this region reported a total of 3,932 deaths during the full-scale war, the investigation read. Russia&apos;s real losses are likely higher, as the media analysis is estimated to cover 45% to 65% of the actual death toll, the BBC reported. According to the journalists&#x2019; estimates, the actual losses could range from 138,500 to 200,000 people killed. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 8 that about 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed during the full-scale invasion. The last time Moscow officially announced the number of soldiers killed was in September 2022, putting the number at 5,937. Ukraine&#x2019;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Jan. 19 that Russian forces suffered their heaviest losses last year since the start of the full-scale war, with total military losses reaching 434,000 soldiers killed and injured in 2024. This represents around half of the 800,000 killed and injured Russian soldiers since the start of the full-scale war, according to Ukraine&#x2019;s military.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-identifies-over-90-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine/	2025-01-24T06:12:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1240558742.jpg
Ukraine repatriates 757 bodies of fallen soldiers	Ukraine brought back the bodies of 757 soldiers who died fighting against Russia, the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of the Prisoners of War announced on Jan. 24. The bodies of 451 soldiers were recovered from the Donetsk sector of the front line, 71 from the Bakhmut sector, and 51 from the Vuhledar sector. Thirteen and 137 bodies were brought back from the Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia sectors, respectively. Another 34 bodies were repatriated from morgues in Russia. The Geneva Conventions say that those killed in war are entitled to a dignified burial. &quot;Law enforcement officials and forensic experts will identify the victims as soon as possible,&quot; the headquarters wrote. The operation to recover the bodies involved several government and military agencies, including the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the Interior Ministry, the State Emergency Service, and the Armed Forces. The headquarters also thanked the International Committee of the Red Cross for its assistance. In December 2024, Ukraine repatriated the bodies of 503 fallen soldiers, mostly from Donetsk Oblast. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 8 that about 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed during the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-repatriates-757-bodies/	2025-01-24T05:22:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1251615116.jpg
Investigation: How Russia profits from arms exports to Saudi Arabia despite sanctions	Few agreements are shrouded in more secrecy than inter-government arms deals &#x2014; especially when one of the parties is a global pariah leading a bloody war. But a recent massive leak of emails and documents has given us an unprecedented glimpse into a particularly secretive transaction. The leak reveals that Saudi Arabia agreed to pay Russia over 2 billion euros under a contract signed in 2021 involving companies that were repeatedly sanctioned, both before and after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Saudi Arabia doesn&#x2019;t appear to have canceled the contract after the invasion started, despite the risk of repercussions from the U.S. &#x2014; a major supplier of weapons to Saudi Arabia. Data included in the leak also shows that Russia has continued to sell arms to up to a dozen countries since the start of its invasion of Ukraine, bolstering its defense production and war effort. Apart from Saudi Arabia, the documents reveal contracts with traditional buyers of Russian weapons, such as India, China, or Algeria, none of which have stopped buying arms from Russia. The Kyiv Independent, in partnership with OCCRP, obtained a leak containing thousands of internal emails of Roselectronics, a subsidiary of Russia&apos;s state arms giant Rostec. Arms exports have traditionally been one of Russia&#x2019;s biggest sources of revenue, although far behind oil and gas. These revenues are now being used to support Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. Sanctions imposed after the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine have significantly reduced the country&#x2019;s arms exports. Still, Russia has managed to continue trade with a dozen countries that have not imposed sanctions on Moscow, making it the world&#x2019;s third-largest weapons exporter in 2023. The leak reveals the relentless efforts of Russian arms manufacturers to sustain exports during the war. Exports help support Russia&#x2019;s arms industry and fuel its war machine, despite numerous sanctions imposed over its assault on Ukraine. Analysts say the sales also serve as Russia&#x2019;s &#x201C;tool of influence,&#x201D; strengthening its alliances and helping it secure votes at the United Nations. Russia may have even obtained access to Western weapons technologies through its arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Even in internal documentation and letters, Russia maintains some secrecy when it comes to the foreign governments who buy their weapons. As the leak shows, instead of directly naming the countries that purchase their military products, Russia uses a system that assigns a code to foreign countries, known in Russian as the &#x201C;All-Russian Classifier of Countries of the World.&#x201D; For example, &#x201C;foreign customer 012&#x201D; stands for Algeria. In 2022, Russia was going to supply Algeria with its Acacia-E automatic aerospace defense system, according to the leak. When reporting on deliveries of the Post-3M radio reconnaissance station to Iran in 2021, the letters describe the buyer as &#x201C;foreign customer 364.&#x201D; When mentioning the supply of Polyana-D4M1 command and control system to Egypt, planned for 2025, they code the buyer as &quot;foreign customer 818.&quot; Yet not all the codes are so easy to decipher. The leak contains a contract encoded in a special way &#x2014; Project 82P. There is no such country code as &#x201C;82P,&#x201D; and the client country isn&#x2019;t mentioned in almost any of the letters that concerned the project. It appears that this contract was more sensitive than others. &quot;All the information related to interaction with the foreign customer specified in the contract is subject to restriction,&quot; one of the letters on Project 82P reads. It also says that to keep the details of the contract secret, Russia planned to sign separate confidentiality agreements with the banks involved in the project. Having analyzed hundreds of letters mentioning Project 82P, the Kyiv Independent can confirm that this code stands for an agreement with Saudi Arabia to supply Pantsir air defense systems. The &quot;82&quot; is a part of the country code for Saudi Arabia (682), and the letter &quot;P&quot; could be referring to the product name &#x2014; Pantsir. Within the contract, the Russian side was to supply Saudi Arabia with the Russian Pantsir-S1M system and provide additional services related to it. The Pantsir is a self-propelled air defense missile and gun system. It can shoot down missiles, airplanes, helicopters, aerial bombs, and drones. The system itself is a large truck equipped with missiles and anti-aircraft guns, which can be used alone or in battery together with a command post and radar truck. It recently gained notoriety, as a Russian Pantsir-S battery is alleged to have brought down the Azerbaijan Airlines flight on Dec. 25, killing 38 people. A view of the crash site where an Azerbaijan Airlines plane with 67 people on board, traveling from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Grozny in Russia&apos;s Chechen Republic crashed near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan, on Dec. 25, 2024. (Emergency Situations of Kazakhstan/Anadolu via Getty Images)2 billion euros for Russian military productionWhile the deal was secret, some evidence surfaced in 2024 that Saudi Arabia obtained Russia&#x2019;s Pantsir systems. In February 2024, a photo appeared online showing a man, allegedly a Saudi soldier, posing next to a Pantsir with a training certificate in his hand. At the end of the year, the Saudi Air Defense&#x2019;s Bulletin listed the Pantsir among its new air defense systems. No other details were provided. With the leaked Roselectronics emails, the Kyiv Independent can piece together how Saudi Arabia obtained the Russian air defense systems. The emails reveal not only the high value of the contract but also how Saudi money flows directly to Russian military companies united under the Rostec brand. According to the leaked documents, Saudi Arabia agreed to pay 2.17 billion euros for the supply of Pantsir batteries, additional equipment and ammunition, and the training of operators. A battery is a military tactical unit consisting of several pieces of artillery working together. A Pantsir battery usually includes up to six pieces. According to various references to the contract found in the leaked emails, Saudi Arabia ordered anywhere from six to 10 Pantsir batteries. In more detail, the contract description includes 39 combat vehicles, 10 command post units, nine radio command vehicles, 20 loader vehicles, hundreds of missiles, and tens of thousands of cartridges. To maintain the Pantsirs, Saudi Arabia also ordered seven repair vehicles, five evacuation trucks, seven fuel servicing trucks, seven storage and transportation vehicles, and other equipment. They bought various simulators to train the Saudi military and planned three training rounds. The contract was signed on April 8, 2021, and was expected to last 58 months &#x2014; that is, until 2026. The Saudi Defense Ministry made an advance payment of 15% of the contract, or 326 million euros, on Aug. 5, 2021, feeding the Russian military machine with cash just six months before Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Delivery of the first batch of the air defense systems and related equipment was scheduled for the end of 2023. International trade records found in the ImportGenius database show that at the end of November 2023, Rosoboronexport made two shipments of four units of &#x201C;new special purpose motor vehicles&#x201D; to Saudi Arabia. The description is vague but the trademark of the vehicles, the names of Russian shippers and a Saudi consignee, and the cargo delivery point &#x2014; an air defense base in Jeddah &#x2014; indicate that the vehicles were supplied under the Pantsir contract. The leaked Russian documents also show how many subsidiaries of the Russian arms conglomerate Rostec, which is sanctioned by many countries for its role in the war against Ukraine, benefit from the Pantsir exports. Here&#x2019;s how Saudi money moved through the Russian arms holding. The advance payment went from the Saudi Defense Ministry to Rosoboronexport. This state company, a part of the Rostec conglomerate, acts as an intermediary for all of Russia&apos;s military exports and imports, receives payments, takes a commission for contract management, and subsequently transfers the rest of the money to the contractors. Following receipt of the advance payment, Rosoboronexport distributed the bulk of the funds to state-owned Russian arms producers &#x2014; Shipunov Design Bureau, known as the developer of the Pantsir complex, United Instrument Manufacturing Corporation (also known under its Russian acronym, OPK), the managing company of the Roselectronics holding, Sozvezdie Concern, the Scientific Research Institute of Communication and Automated Control Systems (NIISSU), the truck producer KAMAZ&#x2019; subsidiary Remdizel and others. Each entity has a role in the contract. For example, OPK has been appointed as the radio command vehicles supplier, while Sozvezdie Concern and NIISSU are its main co-executors. Russian KAMAZ and its subsidiary Remdizel produce the chassis for the system. All these companies are currently subject to numerous international sanctions either for their role in the deployment of Russian military technologies on the battlefield in Ukraine or for providing a substantial source of revenue to the Russian government during the war. Rosoboronexport has also been repeatedly subject to U.S. sanctions within a nonproliferation program against Iran, Syria, and North Korea. The latest Iran-related sanctions were imposed on Rosoboronexport in 2023. Rostec was subject to U.S. sanctions before 2022, including for its connection with Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and military cooperation with China. Sanctions on Rostec companies involved in the production and supply of the Pantsir system. (Lisa Kukharska / The Kyiv Independent)The transfer of Russian technology to Saudi ArabiaAccording to the leak, the delivery of Pantsir batteries and additional equipment is only part of the 82P Project. In addition to the 2-billion-euro contract, the documents describing the project mention a second major part of the cooperation. The contract for it, even three contracts, was not yet signed in the first half of 2022, but was already being discussed. This includes localizing Russian Pantsir systems production in Saudi Arabia, establishing maintenance centers in the country, and creating a training center. The future localization of production was Saudi Arabia&apos;s requirement to sign the first contract to supply air defense systems. A leaked letter titled &#x201C;Localization Plan&#x201D; contains a 69-page document entitled Proposal for the Localization of the Pantsir-S1M Complex Production. The proposal includes three localization programs. The first describes the large-scale assembly of 15 Pantsir batteries in Saudi Arabia. The second localization program establishes a network of service centers for Pantsir maintenance (five regional and one central repair workshop). The third program involves building a training center in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia&apos;s second-largest city and &quot;economic capital.&quot; The center would require the construction of a 15,000-square-metre study building. Although none of the three contracts had been signed during the time period covered by the leak, the leaked documents mentioned that Saudi Arabia was ready to sign the assembling production contract in the second half of 2022. If the contracts were indeed signed, Russia could receive even more than 2 billion euros from Saudi Arabia over the next few years. Russia&apos;s war with Ukraine, though, could have affected the fate of any joint Pantsir assembly in Saudi Arabia, as the war has allegedly already affected a couple of other Russian export contracts. &quot;There was a report that Russia had taken away the shells made for Azerbaijan because it needed them in the war against Ukraine,&quot; Ivan Kirichevsky, an analyst at Defense Express, reported. &quot;Another report indicates that Russian T-90S export tanks intended to be sold to India, Algeria, or Vietnam were also spotted on the battlefield in Ukraine. So there are some doubts as to whether Russians can reach the next stage of the Saudi contract &#x2014; the organization of joint production. They are now highly dependent on imports of various equipment and electronic components. This may affect co-production arrangements.&quot; The Pantsir contract carries with it the risk of Russia becoming familiar with Western technologies through its cooperation with Saudi Arabia. The country is a major buyer of U.S. weaponry and buys arms from South Korea and EU countries, including air defense systems. &quot;Saudi Arabia is one of the major operators of Patriot systems. Whether the Russians could have gained access to them is a sensitive issue,&quot; said Ivan Kirichevsky, an analyst at Defense Express, a Kyiv-based military think tank. &quot;The U.S. has demonstrated that it is sensitive to the risk of transferring its technology to third parties.&#x201D; Kirichevsky cites the example of Turkey. In 2020, four months before the Russian-Saudi agreement was signed, the U.S. slapped sanctions on Turkey over a purchase of the Russian S-400 missile system. The risk of Russians accessing U.S. technology is high since the Project 82P also includes &#x201C;integration&#x201D; services, meaning integrating the Pantsir complex into Saudi Arabia&apos;s command, communications, and intelligence system. Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman hold a meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Dec. 6, 2023. (Sergei Savostyanov / Pool / AFP via Getty Images)Those services would be performed by Russian specialists, who could obtain access to the existing Saudi arsenal, which is stuffed with U.S. weapons. Moreover, Russia appeared to have asked for this access. In October 2021, some six months after signing the contract, Saudi Arabia&apos;s representatives met with the Russian side in Moscow to discuss the execution of Project 82P. The Kyiv Independent found the meeting&#x2019;s minutes in Russian companies&#x2019; emails. The emails mention an upcoming trip by Russian representatives to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, scheduled for May 2022. While discussing the meeting, the Russian side requested to visit Saudi air defense facilities &#x2014; and received consent. They started making preparations for the trip like booking the hotel, car rental, and buying tickets. The obtained email leak covers the time up until May 2022, the same month when the trip was supposed to take place. While the Kyiv Independent can&#x2019;t confirm that the trip took place, there was no sign it was canceled either. The Saudi Defense Ministry did not respond to a written inquiry from the Kyiv Independent. Russia&#x2019;s efforts show it&#x2019;s highly interested in selling arms and military technology abroad, despite its massive need for weapons for its war against Ukraine. &#xA0; According to one of the leaked letters, in June 2022, four months after the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, state arms exporter Rosoboronexport held a three-day meeting with arms manufacturers in St. Petersburg. The event was private, with no public mentions of it. The topic was promoting Russia&apos;s anti-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipment &quot;with high export potential.&quot; A Rosoboronexport representative held a presentation on how export sales could be boosted. Two months later, in August 2022, Rosoboronexport hosted a different event, this time a public one. Its seven-day International Military-Technical Forum aimed to secure new arms sales contracts. It reportedly attracted delegations from 50 countries. Local media made no secret of Russia&#x2019;s efforts to interest foreign delegations in a wide range of military products, including tanks, armored vehicles, UAVs and anti-UAVs, air defense systems, rifles, mortars, and fighter aircraft. Similar events were held in 2023 and 2024 and are planned for 2025. Trying so hard to sell weapons abroad while leading a resource-demanding war may seem like an odd thing to do but there are at least two good reasons for Russia to pursue it: high export revenue and strengthening geopolitical ties. Arms under export contracts are traditionally sold at a higher price than those supplied to the domestic army. &quot;The policy of arms export contracts is always the same: You sell your products to someone for export at a premium to supply your army at a lower cost,&quot; said Kirichevsky, an analyst at Defense Express. &quot;The price of the 2 billion euros for six Pantsir batteries seems very high, even when it includes additional equipment and training for the military.&quot; Although Russia&#x2019;s export capacity started crumbling after the start of Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, it remained a significant exporter of military products. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) compared data on Russian arms exports for two periods: 2014-2018 and 2019-2023. The institute found that, between those two periods, the volume of Russian arms exports fell by 53%. The number of countries willing to buy Russian arms has also decreased, but 12 countries were still buying Russian weapons in 2023. Leaked letters show that Rosoboronexport received new export inquiries after Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. In spring 2022, soon after the world learned about the Russian massacre of civilians in Ukraine&#x2019;s Bucha and other places, the Russian defense conglomerate received new inquiries from potential clients. The leaked emails show that Armenia inquired about a possible delivery of the Ranzhir-M1, a command center unit for air defense systems. Meanwhile, Venezuela was interested in Pishchal-Pro and Kupol complexes, the systems that take down unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs. The Kyiv Independent was unable to find confirmation of such deliveries in public sources, or in the customs records available through leaks. Russia also continued to work on executing contracts signed in previous years. There are no mentions of any contracts canceled by either side after the start of the invasion. In 2022, Rostec worked on contracts with China, India, Algeria, Egypt, Belarus, and several other countries, all of which continued to receive military supplies from Russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and new sanctions against the Russian defense companies. Experts say that Russia is motivated to sell its weapons abroad not only by money but by the prospect of establishing or strengthening of geopolitical ties. &#xA0; &quot;Russia sees arms sales as another tool of statecraft. It&apos;s a tactic,&quot; Anna Borshchevskaya, a senior fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, says. &quot;It&apos;s not independent of foreign policy, and so arms sales will strengthen bilateral ties between countries on a political level. It&apos;s a tool of influence from the Russian perspective.&quot; According to Agiya Zagrebelska, a Ukrainian sanctions expert and representative of the NGO Economic Security Council of Ukraine, the result of such ties can be seen in the countries&apos; votes at the UN. Although the allegiance to Russia is not as clear as in the case of Belarus, China, or Iran, Saudi Arabia has abstained from more than half of the UN votes for resolutions on Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. (See the chart) How countries buying Russian weapons vote at the UN. (Lisa Kukharska / The Kyiv Independent)On the one hand, the country voted for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. However, it abstained from voting on resolutions on the suspension of Russia&#x2019;s rights of membership in the Human Rights Council and on remedy and reparation for aggression against Ukraine. Saudi Arabia has also helped to free foreigners imprisoned by the Russian military and brought together 42 countries in Jeddah to find ways to end the Russian war in Ukraine. It has also allegedly threatened the G7 against seizing Russia&#x2019;s frozen assets, according to Bloomberg&#x2019;s sources. The country has also promised to provide Ukraine with $400 million in humanitarian aid while pledging billions to Russia&#x2019;s military enterprises. Yet even with rich clients like Saudi Arabia, the volume of Russia&#x2019;s arms exports has fallen in recent years. Due to Western sanctions, it has become both difficult and costly for Russia to import Western equipment and electronic components it still needs for defense production. Some reports also suggest that Russia deployed some of the weapons meant for export to the front line in Ukraine. This makes Russia an increasingly problematic supplier. Hey! This is Alisa Yurchenko, the author of this story. Thank you for reading it. I spent the past two months reading leaked internal correspondence of Russian state defense companies. The letters were scattered and out of order, so I had to reconstruct their timeline like a jigsaw puzzle. But it was all worth it. I was glad to reveal how many sanctioned Russian military companies profit from a major arms export deal. Understanding this is crucial as such deals bolster Russian defense industry and the country&#x2019;s geopolitical standing &#x2014; all while Russia is waging a full-scale war. We are not done with this particular leak, however. We are still analyzing it and will soon share insights about Russia&apos;s efforts to source foreign components for its defense industry.

Russia says ban on Ukraine’s NATO accession ’key’ condition for resolving war	Moscow sees a ban on Ukraine&#x2019;s entry to NATO as a key condition in resolving the Russia-Ukraine war, the pro-Kremlin news agency Interfax reported on Jan. 24, citing Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko. &quot;And will not only seek ironclad international guarantees that will prevent Ukraine&#x2019;s membership in NATO in any form, but we will also insist it will become a policy of the alliance itself,&quot; Grushko said on air on the Rossiya-24 television channel. The statement comes amid expectations of peace talks in 2025 as U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table and end the full-scale war that has been ongoing for nearly three years. &quot;For us, this is one of the key elements of a possible deal on the conflict in Ukraine, this relates to the elimination of the root causes of this conflict,&quot; Grushko said about putting an end to Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO prospects. The Russian deputy minister lashed out against the NATO Bucharest Summit&#x2019;s resolution from 2008 that Ukraine and Georgia would eventually become members of the alliance. Grushko called the statement &quot;catastrophic for European security&quot; and said a failure to withdraw it would create an &quot;unacceptable ambiguity&quot; for Russia. Despite the allied pledge, Kyiv and Tbilisi failed to obtain the Membership Action Plan at the summit. Ukraine officially submitted its application to NATO in September 2022 in the wake of the full-scale invasion. Though pledging that Ukraine&#x2019;s path toward membership is &quot;irreversible&quot; at the allied summit in Washington in 2024, NATO members have yet to extend a formal invitation. Russian officials have previously listed Ukraine&#x2019;s possible entry into NATO as one of the justifications for launching the full-scale invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that several NATO countries &#x2013; namely the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia &#x2013; continue to oppose Ukraine&#x2019;s membership but voiced his belief that Trump could sway all the members should he decide to support Kyiv&#x2019;s entry. There is little evidence that the new Trump administration would be more open to accepting Ukraine into NATO than former U.S. President Joe Biden. Trump even attacked Biden over alleged support for Kyiv&apos;s aspirations, claiming it provoked Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/moscow-names-ban-on-ukraines-nato-accession-key-demand-in-potential-talks/	2025-01-24T04:46:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2161623541.jpg
Russian army failing to outflank Pokrovsk, Ukraine's military says	The Russian army is failing to outflank Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast in an attempt to cut off the town&apos;s logistics routes, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces, Viktor Trehubov, said on Jan. 24 on national television. The area near Pokrovsk, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian forces, has been the focus of fierce fighting for months as Russia intensifies its offensive in Donetsk Oblast. Russian forces are trying to bypass Pokrovsk from the north and south, but so far without success, according to the spokesperson. &quot;So far, these attempts have been more or less effectively repelled. They have begun to attack the town more actively with long-range, different types of missiles and FPV (first-person-view) drones,&quot; Trehubov said. &quot;Unfortunately, they are hitting the town, but their plan to surround it is still very far from realization,&quot; he added. The estimated Russian advance in the Pokrovsk sector in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 23, 2025, according to DeepState. Pokrovsk marked by a black symbol. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Trehubov stressed that the Pokrovsk sector of the front line is the primary vector of Russia&apos;s offensive. &quot;This is the main point of concentration of their efforts, and it has been for a long time. There is the largest number of clashes there,&quot; he said. Russian troops are continuing to push on the Lyman, Siversk, Kramatorsk, Toretsk, Pokrovsk and Kurakhove axes, according to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff. Pokrovsk and Kurakhove remain the focal points of the Russian eastern offensive, now in its fifth month. Ukraine previously blew up the No. 3 mine&apos;s shaft in the village of Pishchane near Pokrovsk to prevent Russia from deploying its troops closer to the front-line town, according to The New York Times (NYT) Earlier this month, Metinvest announced it had suspended operations at the Pokrovsk coking coal mine due to worsening security conditions and power outages.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-army-fails-to-outflank-pokrovsk-cut-it-off-from-logistics-ukraines-military-says/	2025-01-24T04:33:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184404872.jpg
Trump plans to reach out to North Korea’s Kim Jong Un	U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview on Jan. 23 he intends to again engage North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, signaling a shift from the previous Biden administration. &quot;I&apos;ll reach out to him again,&quot; Trump said in the interview with Fox News. Kim, who Trump lauded as a &quot;smart guy,&quot; has become Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s key ally in a war against Ukraine, providing ballistic missiles and artillery and sending 12,000 troops to fight in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. &quot;He&#x2019;s not a religious zealot. He happens to be a smart guy,&quot; the U.S. president said, adding that he had good relations with Kim during his first presidential term in 2017-2021. The North Korean dictator has grown increasingly assertive in recent years, cementing an alliance with Russia and carrying out new missile tests. This prompted sharp deterioration of relations with the U.S. under the Biden administration and rising tensions on the Korean peninsula. Initially dismissive of the North Korean leader during his first term in office, Trump later engaged Pyongyang in a rare diplomatic effort to halt the North Korean nuclear program and even claimed to have built a warm personal relationship with Kim. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently admitted that Trump&#x2019;s diplomatic efforts did not achieve any &quot;enduring&quot; progress in stalling Pyongyang&#x2019;s nuclear arms development. Trump&#x2019;s return to the White House is expected to bring geopolitical shifts as the president has often voiced sympathies for the U.S.&#x2019;s rivals and authoritarian leaders, like Putin or Kim, while being critical of Washington&#x2019;s allies. The U.S. president said he plans to reach out to Putin and broker a peace deal in Ukraine, threatening with additional sanctions unless Moscow agrees to negotiate.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-plans-to-reach-out-to-north-koreas-kim-jong-un/	2025-01-24T03:45:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1159161640.jpg
Victory means restoring territorial integrity' — Merz reaffirms support for Ukraine ahead of elections	Friedrich Merz, the leading contender to become Germany&apos;s next chancellor, said that if elected, his strategic priorities would include a just end to Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, Der Spiegel reported on Jan. 23. The statement comes after Merz&#x2019;s meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan. 22. Merz is the chancellor candidate of the conservative CDU/CSU alliance for the February parliamentary elections. The veteran politician has repeatedly criticized sitting Chancellor Olaf Scholz for supposedly hesitant approach in the support of Ukraine and called for the provision of long-range Taurus missiles. Speaking about ending the war, Merz stressed that Ukraine should &quot;win the war&quot; and be free to choose its political and military alliances. &quot;Victory means restoring territorial integrity with a democratically legitimate government exercising full sovereignty,&quot; Merz added. The German politician nevertheless stressed that Germany should not become a party to the war. Germany has become Ukraine&#x2019;s second largest military donor after the U.S., making it Kyiv&#x2019;s leading supporter on the European continent. Berlin&#x2019;s importance in the pro-Ukraine coalition is likely to grow as U.S. President Donald Trump hinted at reducing his country&#x2019;s involvement in the war. While Berlin has allocated 4 billion euros ($4.2 billion) in defense aid for Ukraine in 2025, some ministers of the outgoing coalition government called for an additional 3 billion ($3.15 billion), a step Scholz refuses to take without additional borrowing. The CDU/CSU alliance, whose backing is crucial for any bill to pass the parliament since the ruling coalition lost majority, voiced support for the additional aid package but rejected abandoning the debt break, leading to a legislative impasse.	https://kyivindependent.com/merz-voices-support-for-ukraine-ahead-of-elections/	2025-01-24T03:31:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187620278--1-.jpg
Putin ready to talk to Trump, Kremlin 'awaits signals' from US	Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to hold talks with U.S. President Donald Trump, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Jan. 24 during a press briefing. Trump has previously said he wants to meet with Putin &quot;very quickly&quot; after his inauguration. The Kremlin welcomed Trump&apos;s comments but added that no preparations were currently underway for the meeting. &quot;Putin is ready, we are waiting for signals, everyone is ready... If there is something, we will inform you,&quot; Peskov said. Moscow is ready for talks with Washington on nuclear disarmament as well, but the arsenals of the U.S.&#x2019;s allies &#x2014; the U.K. and France &#x2014; must also be considered, the spokesperson claimed. &quot;In the interests of the whole world, in the interests of the peoples of our countries, of course, we are interested in starting this negotiation process as soon as possible,&quot; he added. Peskov also reacted to Trump&apos;s recent statement that he would ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which Russia is a member, to lower the oil price and that this would end the war &quot;immediately.&quot; The spokesperson opposed the statement, saying that the war is not dependent on oil prices and is allegedly taking place because of &quot;the danger to Russia and the Russians.&quot; The Trump team hopes to quickly begin work on a settlement plan that could be implemented within the first few months of his presidency. A meeting with Putin is part of the plan, according to CNN. Trump has often voiced sympathies for the Russian leader while criticizing the level of support the previous Biden administration provided to Kyiv. This prompted concerns that the new U.S. leadership might cut a deal unfavorable to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-ready-to-talk-to-trump-kremlin-awaits-signals-from-us/	2025-01-24T02:41:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1251866099.jpg
Ukraine’s UAVs target Russian refinery, plants in massive strike	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and Ukraine&#x2019;s Special Operations Forces (SOS) struck the Ryazan Oil Refinery and the Ryazan Thermal Power Plant in an overnight drone strike on Jan. 24, an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. The news comes as Russia&#x2019;s Defense Ministry reported intercepting 121 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 37 in Bryansk Oblast, 20 in Ryazan Oblast, and 17 in the Kursk and Saratov oblasts each. The refinery, one of Russia&#x2019;s largest, has the capacity of 17 million metric tons of oil per year. At least three oil depots and a workshop were set ablaze, according to the source. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video that purports to show the aftermath of a Ukrainian drone strike against Ryazan, Russia, on Jan. 24, 2025. (SBU source)The statement confirms earlier reports in Russian Telegram channels that the Ryazan Oil Refinery caught fire after a drone attack. &quot;SBU and SOS drones also targeted an oil pumping station at the Ryazan Thermal Power Plant,&quot; the source said, without revealing details on possible consequences. Ryazan lies roughly 500 kilometers (310 miles) north of Ukraine&#x2019;s border. Drones also attacked the Kremniy EL microelectronics plant in Russia&apos;s Bryansk and other facilities in the city, the independent Telegram news channel Astra reported, citing Russian Emergencies Ministry sources. It is not immediately clear whether the plant, which produces components for the Russian military, suffered significant damage in the attack. The drone strike also damaged windows and the facade of a building of the Investigative Committee, and the Institute of Management and Business caught fire, according to Astra. Andrii Kovalenko, the counter-disinformation chief at Ukraine&#x2019;s National Security and Defense Council, also reported on the attack against the Kremniy plant. The facility has suspended operations after sustaining hits, Kovalenko claimed, saying that the plant produces microelectronics for Russian air defenses, Iskander missiles, electronic warfare equipment, and drones. This is the third time the plant was hit during the full-scale war, Kovalenko said. The city of Bryansk lies around 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Russia&#x2019;s border with Ukraine. The attack against the Ryazan oil facilities and the Kremniy plant was later confirmed by the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. Recent weeks saw Ukraine again intensify long-range strikes against military and industrial facilities in Russia&#x2019;s rear in an effort to undermine Moscow&#x2019;s ability to wage war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-uavs-reportedly-attack-russian-microelectronics-plant-other-facilities-overnight/	2025-01-24T02:09:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/2025-01-24-12_03_42.jpg
Uncontrolled escalation' — Russia opposes NATO peacekeepers in Ukraine	Deploying a NATO peacekeeping contingent to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire in the war with Russia could lead to &quot;uncontrolled escalation,&quot; Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova claimed on Jan. 23 during a press briefing. The statement comes amid discussions about a possible deployment of European soldiers to Ukraine to monitor a future ceasefire deal. Zakharova also mentioned recent statements by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius that their countries could provide troops for a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine. &quot;The intervention of NATO troops in Ukraine is categorically unacceptable for Russia, it will turn into uncontrolled escalation,&quot; she said. Zelensky has been in contact with several European leaders about the prospects of the peacekeeping mission, an initiative that French President Emmanuel Macron has spearheaded. Pistorius said earlier that Germany, as NATO&apos;s largest member in Europe, &quot;will have a role to play&quot; in keeping peace in Ukraine, while Starmer said that the U.K. had discussed the idea of a peacekeeping mission with other allies and that it will play a &quot;full part&quot; in peacekeeping efforts. The idea has also found support from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called upon Europe to take up greater responsibility for Ukraine&#x2019;s security and pledged to bring a swift end to the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/sending-nato-peacekeepers-to-ukraine-could-lead-to-uncontrolled-escalation-russia-claims/	2025-01-24T01:13:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1237721878.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 6, injure 9 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed at least six people and injured at least nine over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 24. Russia launched 58 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force said. Twenty-five drones were shot down over seven oblasts, while 27 were lost in the airspace without causing damage, according to the statement. Drone attacks in Kyiv Oblast killed three civilians and injured a 26-year old man, the regional police department said. Two of the people killed in the attacks were a married couple in Brovary and another man in the Fastiv district, according to the State Emergency Service. Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast over the past day killed two people and injured five, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Two civilians were killed and two injured in an attack against the city of Kostiantynivka, two were injured in Kramatorsk, and one in Pokrovsk, according to the statement. In Kharkiv Oblast, a 54-year-old woman was killed in a drone attack against the village of Petropavlivka, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Three civilians were injured in Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast, said the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. Two apartment buildings and nine houses were damaged.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-121/	2025-01-24T00:17:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/2025-01-24-10_10_01.jpg
Seoul suspects North Korea plans to send more troops to Russia-Ukraine war	North Korea is preparing to send more troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine, even after incurring significant losses, the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) warned on Jan. 24, according to the Yonhap news agency. North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces in countering a Ukrainian incursion launched in early August 2024. Ukrainian forces have continued fighting in the region, hoping to leverage their positions for potential negotiations. &quot;With around four months having passed since the deployment of troops to the war between Russia and Ukraine, (North Korea) is assumed to be accelerating preparations for additional measures and deployment amid multiple casualties and occurrence of prisoners,&quot; the statement read, according to Yonhap. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, said previously that Pyongyang is reportedly preparing reinforcements, mainly gun and rocket artillery units, to participate in the war in Ukraine. The New York Times reported that according to an undisclosed U.S. official, fresh North Korean troops could arrive within two months. North Korea is also expected to send Russia 150 short-range KN-23 ballistic missiles in 2025, according to Budanov. Experts interviewed by the Kyiv Independent connected North Korea&#x2019;s high casualty rates to a lack of experience with modern warfare, the &quot;human wave&quot; tactics employed against entrenched Ukrainian positions, and the resolve of North Korean troops to avoid capture, even at the cost of their own lives. Only two North Korean soldiers are in Ukrainian captivity since Pyongyang deployed its troops in Kursk Oblast last fall.	https://kyivindependent.com/south-korea-suspects-north-korea-of-sending-more-troops-to-war-in-ukraine/	2025-01-23T23:39:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1734340818.jpg
Zelensky is ’no angel’ — Trump suggests Ukrainian president shares blame for war	U.S. President Donald Trump indicated that both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine&#x2019;s President Volodymyr Zelensky share the blame for the Ukraine-Russia war in an interview segment with Fox News released on Jan. 23. &quot;Zelensky... shouldn&#x2019;t have allowed this to happen either. He&#x2019;s no angel,&quot; Trump said. &quot;First of all, he&#x2019;s fighting a much bigger entity.&quot; Already during his electoral campaign, Trump implied that his predecessor, former U.S. President Joe Biden, and Zelensky share blame for Russia&#x2019;s ongoing invasion and pledged to broker a swift peace deal. The U.S. president, who most recently met Zelensky in Paris in December, criticized his Ukrainian counterpart for initially &quot;wanting to fight&quot; instead of cutting a deal. At the same time, Trump acknowledged Ukraine&#x2019;s bravery in resisting Russia and said that the Ukrainian president has &quot;had enough&quot; and is ready for peace. &quot;We started pouring equipment... and they (Ukraine) had the bravery to use the equipment, but in the end, it&#x2019;s a war that has to be settled,&quot; Trump said. Trump has been often critical of the Biden administration&#x2019;s support for Ukraine and boasted about good relations with Putin, sparking concerns he might broker a deal unfavorable to Kyiv. Recently, the U.S. president has adopted a more critical stance toward Moscow, criticizing Putin for reluctance to cut a deal and threatening with economic repercussions if he fails to do so. &quot;Putin shouldn&#x2019;t have done it (launching the full-scale invasion)... and it has to stop,&quot; Trump said, claiming that Russia had lost around 850,000 soldiers while Ukraine lost 700,000. Zelensky put Ukraine&#x2019;s casualty rates at 43,000 killed and 370,000 wounded as of December, while Moscow does not reveal its losses. In the interview, Trump reiterated his warnings that if Russia does not agree to negotiate, the U.S. is going to impose &quot;massive tariffs and massive taxes, and... big sanctions,&quot; adding he &quot;doesn&#x2019;t want to do it&quot; because he &quot;loves&quot; Russia. The U.S. president echoed his earlier claims that the full-scale invasion would have never started if he were in office at the time, blaming the Biden administration for supposedly provoking Putin and allowing him to profit from high energy prices. Trump also lashed out against the former president for not pressuring European countries to donate more support to Ukraine, falsely claiming that Washington spent &quot;$200 billion more than Europe.&quot; The U.S. Congress has allocated over $170 billion to Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, which included the provision of over $60 billion worth of military support. The EU and its member countries have made available $145 billion in financial, military, and humanitarian assistance during the full-scale war. Ukraine recently announced that arrangements for a meeting between Trump and Zelensky are underway, while the U.S. president also said he aims to meet Putin in the coming days to discuss an end to the war. Moscow welcomed Trump&#x2019;s proposal for a meeting but voiced skepticism about a possible peace deal, saying it has to first understand what the U.S.&#x2019;s goals are before entering into any negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-is-no-angel-trump-claims-ukrainian-president-shares-blame-for-war/	2025-01-23T23:02:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2188254103.jpg

2 killed, 1 injured in Russian drone attack on Kyiv Oblast	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Two people have been killed and one other injured in a drone attack overnight on Jan. 24 targeting Kyiv Oblast, the regional military administration reported. A 36-year-old man was killed in the city of Brovary, just outside the capital Kyiv, when falling drone debris struck a 10-storey building. One other person, a 26-year-old man was injured in the ensuing fire at the residential building, sustaining superficial burns to his upper respiratory tract, the Kyiv Oblast Military Administration said. Elsewhere in the region, one person was killed when drone debris fell onto a home. No additional details were provided on the identity of the victim. The full extent of the damage to the residential structures was not immediately clear. Both fires caused by the attacks have been extinguished by emergency crews. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force warned throughout the night of the threat of Russian drone attacks on the capital. Air defenses operated throughout the night. Russia has ramped up the use of attack drones over the past year, regularly launching drones at various targets across the country, including Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/2-killed-1-injured-in-russian-drone-attack-on-kyiv-oblast/	2025-01-23T21:10:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/1000000276.jpg
John Ratcliffe confirmed as CIA Director	The U.S. Senate formally confirmed John Ratcliffe as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on Jan. 23. Ratcliffe, who served as President Donald Trump&apos;s director of national intelligence during part of Trump&apos;s first term in office, was confirmed with 74 senators voting in favor and 24 voting against the appointment. Ratcliffe becomes the second Trump nominee to secure an appointment from the Senate, days after State Secretary Marco Rubio was sworn into his new post. Ratcliffe replaces Bill Burns as the head of the spy agency. During his term as the head of the CIA, Burns reportedly regularly communicated with Ukrainian officials for purposes of intelligence sharing. Burns made his final visit to Kyiv on Dec. 21 to meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky, marking a rare public acknowledgment of their discussions during Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Zelensky noted that he and Burns had met multiple times throughout the war, but such encounters were typically kept confidential The United States under former President Joe Biden had been Ukraine&apos;s key ally, providing substantial financial and military aid since the all-out war began nearly three years ago. Washington is also reported to have consistently shared military intelligence to bolster Ukraine&apos;s defense. In his Senate hearing last week, Ratcliffe alluded to foreign adversaries Russia and China, referring the need for the U.S. to improve the use of artificial intelligence. Ratcliffe, a staunch supporter of Trump, also echoed comments from the president that the Russia-Ukraine war threatens to draw the U.S. into a conflict with a &quot;nuclear country.&quot; It is unclear if the Trump administration will continue to provide the same level of intelligence sharing with Ukraine as it received during the Biden administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/john-ratcliffe-confirmed-as-cia-director/	2025-01-23T18:51:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/1000000261.jpg
Fire reported at oil refinery in Russia's Ryazan Oblast amid drone strike	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A fire erupted at the Ryazan Oil Refinery in Russia after a mass drone attack targeting several regions, Russian Telegram channels reported on Jan. 23. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, air defense systems also intercepted 49 drones across Kursk, Bryansk, Belgorod oblasts, as well as occupied Crimea. Social media reports noted drone activity in Ryazan Oblast, located southeast of Moscow, where explosions were heard at the RNPK oil depot. At least 10 drones were reportedly shot down over the facility, and a fire broke out. The Kyiv Independent cannot immediately verify the reports. The head of the Center for Countering Disinformation of the National Security and Defense Council, Andrey Kovalenko, said that the Ryazan Oil Refinery is one of the key facilities in the Russian oil industry, though it is under sanctions. &#x201C;The refinery plays an important role in providing fuel for both the civilian and military-industrial complex of Russia,&#x201D; he said on Telegram. &#x201C;It produces fuel for military equipment, aviation kerosene, diesel fuel and other types of petroleum products used in tanks, aircraft, ships and other equipment of the Russian Armed Forces.&#x201D; The attack comes amid an uptick in Ukraine&#x2019;s drone operations targeting Russian energy infrastructure. Ukraine has targeted Russia&apos;s fossil fuel infrastructure as part of its strategy to undermine a key funding source for Russia&apos;s war effort. &#x200C;&#x200C;	https://kyivindependent.com/fire-reported-at-ryazan-oil-refinery-in-russia-amid-alleged-drone-strike/	2025-01-23T17:25:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/Ryazan-oil-refinery.jpg
Trump announces readiness to meet with Putin as soon as possible, Reuters reports	U.S. President Donald Trump said that he wanted to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin as soon as possible to end the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported on Jan. 23. Trump also said that he wanted to explore reductions in nuclear arms. &#x201C;I really would like to be able to meet with President Putin soon to get that war ended,&#x201D; Trump said via video link, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a carnage. And we really have to stop that war.&#x201D; Later, speaking at the White House, Trump reiterated his readiness to meet Putin immediately. &#x201C;Every day we don&#x2019;t meet, soldiers are being killed on the battlefield,&#x201D; he said. Trump also claimed that President Volodymyr Zelensky had told him he was open to considering a deal to end the war. While Trump stated that U.S. peace efforts were underway, he offered no specific details. On Jan. 21, at the World Economic Forum, Zelensky revealed that discussions were underway to organize a meeting with Trump. &quot;We are your partner.

Putin has no right to veto any country's NATO accession, NATO Secretary General says	NATO Chief Mark Rutte said on Jan. 23 that Russian President Vladimir Putin has no authority to influence NATO&apos;s future membership decisions. &#x201C;We must clearly understand that Vladimir Putin has no veto power and no say over who will join NATO in the future. Unless, of course, he himself wants to join NATO, but I don&apos;t think he wants that,&#x201D; Rutte said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He emphasized that Ukraine&apos;s full NATO membership is the best guarantee for lasting peace. &#x201C;Whatever the outcome, it must be clear that peace is sustainable&#x2026; when they (negotiations) end, we must be confident that the peace we collectively supported will be enduring and will never be questioned again,&#x201D; he said. Rutte also highlighted the need to avoid repeating the failures of the Minsk agreements and stressed the importance of ensuring Ukraine is in the strongest possible position before any future negotiations with Russia. Earlier in the day, Rutte called on the United States to continue supplying weapons to Ukraine, pledging that Europe will shoulder the financial burden. Nearly 3,000 representatives from over 130 countries, including 60 heads of state and government, 900 CEOs of the world&#x2019;s leading companies, and forum partners, are expected to attend the forum in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-has-no-right-to-veto-any-countrys-nato-accession-nato-secretary-general-says/	2025-01-23T14:48:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2184023227.jpg
Trump’s 90-day foreign aid suspension order does not impact weapon deliveries to Ukraine, Pentagon says	U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s executive order suspending foreign aid programs for 90 days does not apply to military assistance for Ukraine, the Pentagon confirmed to the Ukrainian Service of Voice of America on Jan. 23. &#x201C;Security assistance to Ukraine is not subject to the restrictions of the recent foreign assistance order, as it only applies to development programs, not military support,&#x201D; the U.S. Department of Defense stated. Contracts under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) and weapon deliveries from U.S. warehouses under the Presidential Depletion Authority (PDA) will remain unaffected. These programs, among others, were initiated during President Biden&#x2019;s administration. While Ukrainian military assistance is exempt from the 90-day suspension, the status of development and humanitarian programs is uncertain and still under review. The 90-day suspension was published by the White House on Jan. 20, as one of the numerous executive orders Trump has passed since becoming president. In the document, Trump wrote that &quot;the United States foreign aid industry and bureaucracy are not aligned with American interests and in many cases antithetical to American values,&quot; without mentioning specific examples. In addition to development aid, the U.S. has provided Kyiv with $66 billion in military assistance since the outbreak of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-90-day-foreign-add-suspension-order-does-not-impact-weapon-deliveries-to-ukraine-pentagon-says/	2025-01-23T12:52:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/--------------2024-03-19-202210.png
Ukraine war latest: Russian forces suspected of killing 6 Ukrainian POWs in Donetsk Oblast	Key developments on Jan. 23: Ukrainian prosecutors are investigating a case of Russian troops summarily executing six Ukrainian captives in the embattled Donetsk Oblast, the Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office said on Jan. 23. The statement came in reaction to a video circulating on social media, recorded by Russian soldiers, that apparently shows the execution of the six prisoners of war (POW). The footage also shows a seventh Ukrainian soldier lying on the ground, whose fate is unknown. &quot;According to preliminary information, during an assault against Ukrainian positions in Donetsk Oblast, Russian soldiers took six Ukrainian soldiers captive and subsequently shot them,&quot; the Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office said in a statement. Executing prisoners of war is a serious violation of the Geneva Conventions and a war crime. Ukraine&#x2019;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said he had reached out to the U.N. and the International Committee of the Red Cross regarding the case. Throughout the full-scale war, Ukraine has documented widespread violations of the Geneva Conventions by Russian forces, including the execution of over 100 POWs in 2024 alone, according to Lubinets. Reports of torture, murder, and abuse of Ukrainian captives &#x2014; particularly in Donetsk Oblast &#x2014; have surged in recent months. Visual evidence of these atrocities continues to emerge, underscoring Russia&apos;s disregard for international law. Ukrainian troops positioned near the village of Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk Oblast are at risk of encirclement by Russian forces, military spokesperson Viktor Trehubov said on Jan. 23. Russian forces are attempting to take control of access routes to the village through heavy fire, according to Trehubov, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces. &quot;Velyka Novosilka is currently in a rather difficult situation. Ukrainian soldiers are doing everything to prevent further advances of the enemy,&quot; Trehubov said. However, the geographical layout of the area, including a river that cuts through the village, complicates defensive maneuvers, according to Trehubov. A screenshot of the map by the DeepState monitoring group as of Jan. 23, 2025, showing the front-line village of Velyka Novosilka, Donetsk Oblast. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)According to Trehubov, Russia&apos;s numerical advantage in manpower in the area poses significant challenges. &quot;They are constantly conducting rotations, adding personnel, and replenishing their deployed forces. They still have this resource,&quot; Trehubov added. He said that preventing encirclement and maintaining access to Velyka Novosilka remains a priority for Ukrainian troops. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi previously described the ongoing Russian offensive in the east as &quot;one of the most powerful&quot; since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Throughout the fall of 2024, Russian forces made operational gains in southern Donetsk Oblast, including areas near Toretsk and Chasiv Yar, while advancing near Kupiansk and on Russian soil in Kursk Oblast. President Volodymyr Zelensky on Jan. 22 clarified his earlier comments on the number of European peacekeepers needed to maintain peace in Ukraine, saying the required numbers would depend on the size of Ukraine&#x2019;s own military. The statement comes after Zelensky told a journalist at the World Economic Forum in Davos that at least 200,000 European soldiers would be needed for a stable peace deal. &quot;By the way, I didn&#x2019;t say we need 200,000 (peacekeepers)... A journalist asked me, I said, &apos;maybe more, maybe less,&apos;&quot; Zelensky said when asked about the statement in an interview with Bloomberg TV. Zelensky spoke in comparably stronger terms in Davos, saying: &quot;From all the Europeans? 200,000, it&#x2019;s a minimum. It&#x2019;s a minimum, otherwise it&#x2019;s nothing.&quot; The president explained in the interview that the size of the needed contingent will depend on the strength of the Ukrainian military. As Kyiv would struggle to maintain a million-strong army needed to repel future Russian aggression, fielding such a force would depend on U.S. and European support, he explained. If the U.S. and Europe prove unwilling to help maintain such an army and Ukraine reduces it &quot;by 200,000, 300,000 or 500,000, it means that other troops have to replace them in those numbers,&quot; Zelensky added. The president&#x2019;s conclusion was that in the face of such options, Ukraine&#x2019;s accession to NATO is the cheapest way toward stable peace both for Ukraine and the West. At the same time, Zelensky admitted that some members &#x2013; namely the U.S., Germany, Slovakia, and Hungary &#x2013; remain reluctant to allow Ukraine into the alliance. Zelensky has been in contact with a number of European leaders about the prospects of a peacekeeping mission &#x2014; an initiative that French President Emmanuel Macron has spearheaded. During a visit to Kyiv on Jan. 16, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that his country will play its &quot;full part&quot; in supporting efforts to maintain an enduring peace in Ukraine. The idea has also found support from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called upon Europe to take up greater responsibility for Ukraine&#x2019;s security and pledged to bring a swift end to the war. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte called on the United States to continue supplying weapons to Ukraine, pledging that Europe will shoulder the financial burden, Reuters reported on Jan. 23. &quot;If this new Trump administration is willing to keep on supplying Ukraine, the bill will be paid by the Europeans,&quot; Rutte said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Rutte&apos;s remarks come amid the uncertainty of the U.S. support for Ukraine under President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticized aid to Kyiv, as well as called on Europe to increase its share. Trump has repeatedly lambasted European NATO members for not investing enough in their defense capabilities and instead relying on the U.S. Rutte agreed with Trump&apos;s criticism of Europe&apos;s low defense spending, saying that &quot;Ukraine is closer to Europe than to the U.S.&quot; Earlier on Jan. 22, President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized the importance of U.S. leadership in ending Russia&apos;s war during an interview with Bloomberg. &quot;The end of the war must be a victory for U.S. President Donald Trump, not for Russian President Vladimir Putin,&quot; Zelensky said. During his presidential campaign, Trump has repeatedly called for a swift resolution to Russia&apos;s war and claimed he would be able to end it quickly. However, he hasn&apos;t elaborated on how he plans to achieve that. On Jan. 22, Trump threatened to impose harsher sanctions on Moscow if a &quot;deal&quot; is not reached soon. President Donald Trump said on Jan. 23 that he would ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to lower the price of oil, claiming it would end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine &quot;immediately.&quot; &quot;If the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately,&quot; he said via videolink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. &quot;Right now, the price is high enough that that war will continue, you gotta bring down the oil price and end that war,&quot; he added. OPEC consists of 12 countries including Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, which collectively account for around 30% of the global oil supply. By agreeing to lower or raise the amount of oil they all produce, OPEC can dramatically affect global oil prices. Lower global oil prices would deplete Russia&apos;s main source of revenue that it uses to fund its war in Ukraine, though a recent analysis in Foreign Policy suggested any effects would likely take months to significantly hamper the Kremlin&apos;s war machine. Another Trump policy &#x2014; declaring open season on drilling for U.S. oil and gas &#x2014; could also potentially push down prices and box out Russian oil. Trump was also asked if there would be a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia by the time of next year&apos;s World Economic Forum. &quot;Well, you&apos;ll have to ask Russia. Ukraine is ready to make a deal,&quot; he said. Speaking of China, he said they &quot;have a great deal of power over that situation,&quot; and that he hoped the U.S. could work with Beijing to end the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A day earlier, Trump said that if a &quot;deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine was not reached soon, he would have no choice but to &quot;put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries.&quot; In response, the Kremlin said it sees nothing new in &#xA0;Trump&apos;s threats to impose sanctions if no deal on the war in Ukraine is reached, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Jan. 23. &quot;We don&apos;t see any particularly new elements here. You know that Trump, in the first iteration of his presidency, was the American president who most often resorted to sanctions methods,&quot; Peskov said. Russia is ready for an &quot;equal and respectful&quot; dialogue with the U.S., as it was during Trump&apos;s first term, Peskov added. The Kremlin spokesman also noted that no preparations are currently underway for a meeting between Trump and Putin. President Volodymyr Zelensky led a Ukrainian delegation at the World Economic Forum that sought to highlight the country&apos;s economic potential and investment appeal, framing the country as a &quot;prize, not a burden.&quot; Events held at the Ukraine House, the country&apos;s pavilion at the forum, have focused on Ukraine&apos;s vast natural resources, and defense and agricultural sectors. The delegation&apos;s website says Ukraine holds $26 trillion in mineral wealth, including one-third of Europe&apos;s lithium reserves and significant gas reserves.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russian-forces-suspected-of-killing-6-ukrainian-pows-in-donetsk-oblast/	2025-01-23T12:36:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2153450598.jpg
Russian actor who starred in propaganda films lands Oscar nomination	Russian actor Yura Borisov, who has previously starred in Russian propaganda films and illegally visited Russian-occupied Crimea, has received an Academy Award nomination for his role in the film &quot;Anora.&quot; Borisov is nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category, the U.S. Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced on Jan. 23. Borisov is the first Russian actor to land an Oscar nomination in nearly five decades. This recognition of a Russian actor who has never spoken out against Russia&apos;s aggression comes as Moscow continues to wage a brutal war against Ukraine, which has already killed tens of thousands of people, including at least 12,300 civilians. Directed by U.S. filmmaker Sean Baker, &quot;Anora&quot; is a modern-day reimagining of the Cinderella story set in Brighton Beach&apos;s Russian community. It follows a young sex worker from Brooklyn who impulsively marries the son of a Russian oligarch. The film has also been nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actress at the 97th Academy Awards. The Oscars ceremony will be held on March 2 this year. The nominees for Actor in a Supporting Role are... #Oscars pic.twitter.com/Um5Ba6mR0e Borisov is an acclaimed Russian actor who has starred in a number of Russian films promoting state propaganda, such as &quot;AK-47,&quot; which was partially filmed in occupied Crimea. Russia invaded and illegally annexed Ukraine&apos;s Crimean Peninsula in 2014. Entering Crimea from Russian territory is illegal. Since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion eight years later, Borisov hasn&apos;t publicly spoken out against his country&apos;s war of aggression. The decision has once again sparked a debate over the glorification of Russian culture and cooperation with Russians while Moscow is committing war crimes in Ukraine. Earlier in September, the Toronto International Film Festival sparked outrage for screening &quot;Russians at War,&quot; a documentary by a Russian-Canadian filmmaker that whitewashes Russian soldiers participating in the invasion of Ukraine. At this year&apos;s Oscars, the Ukrainian documentary &quot;Porcelain War&quot; is nominated for Best Documentary Feature. Directed by Brendan Bellomo and Slava Leontyev, the film tells the story of three Kharkiv artists who joined the Ukrainian army while continuing to create porcelain figurines as an act of cultural resistance during Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-actor-who-starred-in-propaganda-films-lands-oscar-nomination/	2025-01-23T12:18:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2188135413.jpg
Trump’s Ukraine war ultimatum sparks angry reaction from Russian milbloggers	Russian military bloggers, known as milbloggers, have responded in defiant terms to Donald Trump&#x2019;s ultimatum to his Russian counterpart, describing it as &quot;blackmail&quot; from a U.S. president acting more like a &quot;king of the playground.&quot; On Jan. 22, Trump called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to &quot;make a deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine, warning that failure to reach an agreement would lead to increased sanctions, tariffs, and taxes on Russian goods. Trump&#x2019;s statement comes after months of repeated claims he would quickly put an end to Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. Though it is still unknown how Trump plans to reach a deal between Russia and Ukraine, members of his team have made it clear that both sides will have to make concessions. In a typically bombastic post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump said he was &quot;not looking to hurt Russia&quot; and maintained he has &quot;always had a very good relationship&quot; with Putin. &quot;We can do it the easy way or the hard way &#x2014; and the easy way is always better,&quot; Trump wrote. &quot;It&apos;s time to make a deal. No more lives should be lost.&quot; The official Russian response was relatively measured, with Russia&apos;s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy saying Russia would have to determine what Trump means by &quot;deal&quot; before entering into negotiations. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Jan. 23 said Moscow didn&#x2019;t see &quot;any particularly new elements&quot; in what Trump said, but added Russia was ready for an &quot;equal and respectful&quot; dialogue with the U.S. But over on Telegram, a messenger app, Russian milbloggers were far more vocal in their opinions of Trump&#x2019;s ultimatum. Pro-Kremlin military bloggers are highly influential in the Russian media ecosystem, sharing insider war coverage and pro-war analysis of events, usually on Telegram. Highly nationalistic, the most prominent have followings in the hundreds of thousands, with some like Rybar having more than a million.

(Natalia Kolesnikova / AFP via Getty Images)German Kulikovsky/Starshe Eddy (Older than the Edda) Trump&apos;s ultimatum &#x2014; in the end, good old Donald is a typical American (salesman), not a politician. Nothing but lies in a fiery speech, all to sell an uninformed average person a completely unnecessary and very poor-quality product. When American astronauts land on Mars, and the Russian army loses a million soldiers killed in the war with &quot;khokhols&quot; (a derogatory word for Ukrainians) then maybe it will be worth considering his proposals. But for now, it&apos;s better to just shut the door or hang up the phone to avoid listening to what the salesman says about his junk. Everyone has already interpreted Trump&#x2019;s ultimatum to Russia however they please, but the meaning is the same &#x2014; either you do as I say, or I&#x2019;ll pressure you even harder with sanctions. As I wrote earlier, there can be no talk of peace. Russia cannot accept what is being offered to it, and Ukraine will not agree to what Russia demands of it. Ukraine should prepare for the complete destruction of its male population, and Russia for a long and grueling war. &apos;To make a deal&apos; &#x2014; an important and well-established American expression Trump took from business. Before the elections, he called Zelensky ineffective. That&#x2019;s the first point. Secondly&#x2026; this is a public ultimatum. How poorly Trump has studied the leadership of our country, to whom he is offering that very deal. Nothing will be agreed to under pressure.And thirdly &#x2014; why should Russia believe the Yankees this time, (believe) that they won&#x2019;t cheat us again? Trump is threatening Russia with new sanctions and the introduction of additional tariffs on Russian goods supplied to the U.S. if Russia doesn&#x2019;t end the special military operation. We&#x2019;ve already been through this under (former U.S. President Joe) Biden. Attempts to change Russia&apos;s position through primitive threats are unlikely to bring Trump the outcome he desires.

(Natalia Kolesnikova / AFP via Getty Images)Kotsnews (Aleksandr Kots) &#xA0;As we assumed, Trump&#x2019;s plan is an ultimatum and blackmail. Like I said, better to prepare for the worst. Biden&#x2019;s term will soon be remembered with nostalgia as a thaw. Remember this post. In a later post&#x2026; Perhaps Donald Trump is unaware, but Vladimir Putin belongs to the pre-TikTok era of global politics, where serious leaders discuss important issues through dialogue, not electronic notes. To express his vision for ending the war in Ukraine, Trump could, at the very least, pick up the phone. This (drama) with demands to make a deal or else sanctions, tariffs, and so on, is hardly appropriate. What exactly do we still trade with the U.S. that&#x2019;s critical to our budget? The last significant revenue stream came from uranium sales &#x2014; the U.S. imported a quarter of its nuclear fuel from Russia. But last May, Biden banned the import of our low-enriched uranium, and in November, Moscow responded by restricting enriched uranium exports to the U.S. Now you can freeze your ears off just to spite Uncle Sam. To be fair, Trump hasn&#x2019;t turned on this thug-like political mode exclusively toward Russia. Canada, Denmark, Panama, and Mexico are also taking hits from &quot;Bold Donnie&quot; and his team. Apparently, the heady success with Hamas (which was open to a ceasefire without threats from the American president) gave him a sense of omnipotence. Trump seems determined to come out looking like a winner no matter the situation. But Russia isn&#x2019;t Gaza. Starting a dialogue with ultimatums isn&#x2019;t the most farsighted move for a leader aiming to position himself as a peacemaker. Moscow will never agree to any deal dictated through blackmail and threats. In short, (it&#x2019;s a) fail, Donald Fredovich. Leave and return as a proper statesman representing a great power, not an overconfident &#x2018;king of the playground.&#x2019;	https://kyivindependent.com/king-of-the-playground-russian-mibloggers-react-to-trumps-war-in-ukraine-ultimatum/	2025-01-23T11:53:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194586652.jpg
UK, US sanctions force Russia's oil tankers to reflag, Bloomberg reports	A growing portion of Russia&apos;s oil tanker fleet is being forced to reflag as U.S. and U.K. sanctions intensify pressure on Moscow&apos;s shipping network, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 23. The removal of these flags disrupts Russia&apos;s oil export logistics, forcing tankers to re-register in less reputable jurisdictions and change ownership to avoid detection. The pressure follows sweeping sanctions introduced on Jan. 10, targeting nearly 200 vessels in Russia&apos;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet.&quot; These ships are used to bypass sanctions on Russian oil exports. The Barbados Ship Registry, which operates under U.K. regulations, will reportedly revoke the flags of 46 vessels under U.K. sanctions by the end of January. Though Barbados does not impose sanctions on Russia, its compliance reflects its strong ties with the U.K. Ships sanctioned by the U.S. but not by the U.K. will retain their Barbadian flags. Panama&apos;s Maritime Authority has similarly begun deregistering 68 vessels, aligning with U.S., EU, U.K., and UN sanctions under rules adopted in late 2024. Compounding the impact of maritime sanctions, Indian banks have reportedly blocked payments for Russian oil imports due to the latest round of U.S. sanctions, according to Energy Intelligence. The tightening measures have already caused a sharp decline in Russian seaborne crude exports, with Bloomberg reporting dozens of tankers dropping anchor and suspending operations since the Jan. 10 sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-and-us-sanctions-force-russias-oil-tankers-to-reflag-bloomberg-reports/	2025-01-23T10:44:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167101990.jpg
57% of Ukrainians believe peace without full territorial integrity will fail, poll shows	A majority of Ukrainians &#x2014; 57% &#x2014; believe any peace agreement that does not fully restore Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity is destined to fail, according to a survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published on Jan. 23. The survey revealed that this stance is shared across age groups, regions, and language practices. The poll, conducted between Nov. 22 and Jan. 7, reflects strong public sentiment as Russia&apos;s full-scale war approaches its third anniversary, with Moscow continuing its offensive in Ukraine&apos;s east. The researchers also noted a link between attitudes toward territorial integrity and perceptions of U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s new administration. Over half of respondents regard Trump&apos;s presidency positively, ranging from &quot;rather good&quot; to &quot;very good.&quot; But those who strongly or somewhat agree with the statement about territorial integrity are more likely to view Trump&apos;s presidency negatively. The survey&apos;s results were based on telephone interviews with 1,600 respondents residing in Ukraine-controlled territories. Expectations for possible peace talks in 2025 are rising, as Trump has vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table. Reports from the Wall Street Journal suggest his administration is weighing a plan to delay Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for continued Western arms supplies and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Dec. 26 that Russia aims to &quot;end the conflict&quot; in 2025, emphasizing hopes for front-line success. He expressed openness to dialogue with Trump but reiterated Russia&apos;s demands, including no territorial concessions.	https://kyivindependent.com/57-of-ukrainians-believe-peace-without-full-territorial-integrity-will-fail-survey-shows/	2025-01-23T10:38:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1347758762-1.jpg
Trump says Russia's war in Ukraine 'will end immediately' if OPEC lowers oil prices	President Donald Trump said on Jan. 23 he will ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to lower the price of oil, saying it would end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine &quot;immediately.&quot; &quot;If the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately,&quot; he said via videolink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. &quot;Right now the price is high enough that that war will continue, you gotta bring down the oil price and end that war,&quot; he added.

Kyiv Independent identifies high-ranking Russian officer, officials involved in looting of museums in southern Ukraine	The Kyiv Independent identified a Russian military officer and three Russian-appointed officials from occupied Crimea who were responsible for the illegal removal of artworks and artifacts from two Kherson museums in the fall of 2022. Fleeing a Ukrainian counteroffensive, Russian forces collectively stole more than 33,000 historical artifacts and works of art. This museum theft is the largest in Europe since World War II. Those who oversaw the theft are Dmitry Lipov, head of the communications center of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, who served as the city&apos;s commandant during the occupation of Kherson, Sergey Patrushev, appointed by the Russian authorities to head the museum department of the so-called Crimean Ministry of Culture, Elena Morozova and Mikhail Smorodkin, appointed by the Russian authorities as directors of the Crimean museums, Tauric Chersonese and the Museum of Defense of Sevastopol. The findings are the basis for the Kyiv Independent&apos;s War Crimes Investigation Unit&apos;s documentary &quot;Curated Theft.&quot; To identify those who took part in the government-sanctioned theft, the Kyiv Independent journalist posed as a Russian TV producer and as a Russian investigator to communicate with local collaborators who helped Russian troops loot. The Kyiv Independent found that Russian officer Lipov was responsible for securing the collections during their removal and personally sealed the trucks that carried the stolen items. Patrushev was responsible for moving paintings from the Kherson Art Museum to occupied Crimea. The directors of the Crimean museums chose items from the Kherson Local History museum&apos;s collection during the looting. The Kyiv Independent also found that the illegal removal of collections from Kherson to occupied Crimea was supervised by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB).	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-independent-identifies-high-ranking-russian-officer-officials-involved-in-looting-of-museums-in-southern-ukraine/	2025-01-23T08:06:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1245781943.jpg
Russia’s looting of history is a theft of who we are	I first visited the looted museums of Kherson, a city in southern Ukraine, in May 2024. At the time, my team at the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s War Crimes Investigations Unit and I were beginning an investigation into the illegal export of artifacts from Kherson to occupied Crimea by Russian forces amid the full-scale war. Over 33,000 works of art and historical artifacts had been stolen from local museums in the fall of 2022, just before the city was liberated from Russian occupation by the Ukrainian military. I went to Kherson thinking that I had already seen so much horror, human tragedy, and pain during two years of the full-scale invasion that I could hardly be affected by the sight of looted museum halls. But when I entered the local history museum, for a few minutes, everything inside me went numb. The large exhibition halls were completely empty, and the display cases that once housed artifacts from the Scythians, Goths, Romans, and Greeks were shattered. The museum director led me to a hall that had been especially significant to the staff and guests. This separate room had displayed gold jewelry from the Scythians and Sarmatians, peoples who inhabited Ukrainian lands thousands of years ago. All that remained of these treasures were the text descriptions on the display cases. I&#x2019;ve known about the Scythians since childhood. I was born and raised in Ukraine&#x2019;s Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, home to the most famous Scythian burial mounds. These ancient graves of a nomadic people have yielded unique gold jewelry and household items through centuries of excavation. In the 20th century, one of these mounds revealed the legendary Golden Pectoral, an ornate decoration belonging to a Scythian aristocrat, which became one of Ukraine&#x2019;s most renowned treasures. I learned about their culture and history in local history lessons at school. After Kherson&#x2019;s liberation, a guard at the local history museum told reporters that Russian forces hadn&#x2019;t just taken valuables &#x2014; they had stolen the Ukrainian soul. The moment I first saw the looted halls, I understood exactly what he meant. I felt as though they had taken part of my Ukrainian identity too. Systematic attacks on Ukrainian culture have been part of Russian state policy since czarist times. In the early 20th century, this practice was adopted by the Bolsheviks, and in the 21st century, it continues with modern Russia. For instance, journalists from Ukrainian outlet Texty analyzed electronic catalogs of two major Russian museums &#x2014; the Hermitage and the State Historical Museum &#x2014; and found over 110,000 items in their collections that originated from modern Ukraine. Many artifacts lack detailed information about their origins, such as the archaeological site or place of discovery. To confirm these items&#x2019; ties to Ukraine, journalists conducted additional research. These artifacts were appropriated during both the Russian Empire and Soviet times. Russia hasn&#x2019;t just looted Ukrainian cultural artifacts; it has also physically eliminated Ukrainian intelligentsia. In the 1920s and 1930s, Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin&#x2019;s regime destroyed an entire generation of Ukrainian artists &#x2014; painters, writers, and directors &#x2014; later called the &#x201C;Executed Renaissance.&#x201D; I have no doubt these actions aim to erase Ukrainian identity. And I know from personal experience how this works. I am a Ukrainian who grew up in a Russified region. Both my grandmothers were born in Ukrainian-speaking families, but my first words were in Russian. As a child, I received New Year&#x2019;s gifts from Father Frost, a character invented by Soviet propaganda, instead of Saint Nicholas, as my ancestors had. I went to school in independent Ukraine, but in music lessons, we sang Soviet songs, like those about Mykola Shchors, a Bolshevik military commander. At the same time, I knew nothing about Mykola Leontovych, the Ukrainian composer who wrote the world-famous &#x201C;Carol of the Bells.&#x201D; I became interested in Ukrainian literature during my student years. That interest expanded to Ukrainian art, especially cinema. I began attending exhibitions of Ukrainian artists and performances by Ukrainian theater directors. Eventually, I abandoned the Russian language entirely. Now, my family and I are reviving Ukrainian traditions. This year, for the first time, I replaced the traditional Christmas tree with a &#x201C;didukh,&#x201D; a Ukrainian Christmas decoration made of wheat. Still, I am on a journey to rediscover my culture and history &#x2014; like millions of other Ukrainians. The more we return to our roots, the harder Russia hits. It loots museums, destroys architectural monuments, and Russifies Ukrainian children in Russian-occupied territories. Its goal is clear: to erase everything Ukrainian and turn the Ukrainian state into a colony once again.

Ukrainian soldiers near Velyka Novosilka at risk of encirclement, spokesperson says	Ukrainian troops positioned near the village of Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk Oblast are at risk of encirclement by Russian forces, military spokesperson Viktor Trehubov said on Jan. 23. Russian forces are attempting to take control of access routes to the village through heavy fire, according to Trehubov, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Khortytsia group of forces. &quot;Velyka Novosilka is currently in a rather difficult situation. Ukrainian soldiers are doing everything to prevent further advances of the enemy,&quot; Trehubov said. However, the geographical layout of the area, including a river that cuts through the village, complicates defensive maneuvers, according to Trehubov. A screenshot of the map by the DeepState monitoring group as of Jan. 23, 2025, showing the front-line village of Velyka Novosilka, Donetsk Oblast. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)According to Trehubov, Russia&apos;s numerical advantage in manpower in the area poses significant challenges. &quot;They are constantly conducting rotations, adding personnel, and replenishing their deployed forces. They still have this resource,&quot; Trehubov added. He said that preventing encirclement and maintaining access to Velyka Novosilka remains a priority for Ukrainian troops. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi previously described the ongoing Russian offensive in the east as &quot;one of the most powerful&quot; since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Throughout the fall of 2024, Russian forces made operational gains in southern Donetsk Oblast, including areas near Toretsk and Chasiv Yar, while advancing near Kupiansk and on Russian soil in Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-soldiers-near-velyka-novosilka-at-risk-of-encirclement-spokesperson-says/	2025-01-23T07:26:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1618591092.jpg
Ukraine's central bank raises key policy rate to 14.5% due to inflation	Ukraine&apos;s National Bank (NBU) announced on Jan. 23 that it will raise the key policy rate from 13.5% to 14.5% per annum starting from Jan. 24. The Ukrainian economy was heavily hit by Russia&apos;s full-scale war. At the start of the invasion, inflation skyrocketed to 26.6% in 2022 from 10.0% in 2021. It subsided the following year but in 2024, the inflation again accelerated to 12%, exceeding NBU&apos;s forecast. &quot;In order to maintain the stability of the foreign exchange market, keep expectations under control, and gradually bring inflation to the 5% target on the policy horizon, the NBU Board decided to raise the key policy rate by 1% to 14.5%,&quot; chairman Andrii Pyshnyi said in a press briefing. The NBU raised its key policy rate to 10% in January 2022. It had remained unchanged since the beginning of the all-out war, but on June 3, 2022, the rate grew from 10% to 25%. For over a year, it remained at the same level, dropping to 22% in July 2023 and following a gradual decline. In December 2024, the NBU raised the key policy rate from 13% to 13.5% in response to inflationary developments. According to Pyshnyi, the NBU will likely continue &quot;tightening interest rate policy if signs of sustained inflationary pressure and the threat of imbalance in inflation expectations persist.&quot; Inflation is likely to continue rising in the first months of 2025, peaking in the second quarter and then starting to decline in the middle of the year. According to the NBU&apos;s forecast, inflation will slow to 8.4% by the end of 2025 and to 5% in 2026. &quot;This will be supported by the NBU&apos;s interest rate and exchange rate policies, as well as by higher harvests, an improvement in the energy sector, a reduction in the fiscal deficit, and moderate external price pressure,&quot; NBU&apos;s statement read.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-national-bank-raises-key-policy-rate-by-1-due-to-inflation/	2025-01-23T06:08:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1401596737.jpg
Trump needs to come out on top' — Zelensky on US president's role in ending war	The end of the war must be a victory for U.S. President Donald Trump, not for Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview for Bloomberg TV on Jan. 22. Zelensky&apos;s statement comes amid Trump&apos;s calls for an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and recent threats to impose sanctions on Moscow if a &quot;deal&quot; is not reached soon. &quot;I think the issue of ending the war in Ukraine must be a victory for Trump, not for Putin. Putin is nobody for him. America is much stronger, Europe is much stronger, China is stronger than Russia. They are all players,&quot; Zelensky told Bloomberg TV. Zelensky added that the war showed Russia&apos;s inability to fully occupy Ukraine. &quot;They (Russia) are big, they have a lot of weapons, and they don&apos;t spare people,&quot; he said. &quot;We are specifically defending Europe, NATO countries. And Putin will go there.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s why Trump needs to come out on top. And he is capable of doing so.&quot; According to Zelensky, Trump must conclude such an agreement that will prevent Putin from resuming the aggression further down the line. The Ukrainian president also noted that &quot;everyone should have a plan&quot; before they start communicating directly with Putin. Trump has signaled his intent to meet Putin &quot;very quickly&quot; after taking office. While the Kremlin welcomed the remarks, it noted that no preparations for the meeting are currently underway. Trump&apos;s team is reportedly working on arranging a call with Putin shortly after the inauguration, with the goal of initiating a settlement plan for the war in Ukraine within the first months of his presidency. The U.S. president&#x2019;s team Trump aims to preserve Ukraine&apos;s independence, though U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that both Kyiv and Moscow would have to make concessions to achieve a peace deal.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-needs-to-come-out-on-top-zelensky-on-us-presidents-role-in-ending-war-in-ukraine/	2025-01-23T05:42:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169777527.jpg
To ban Tchaikovsky or not, that is the question	In 2022, Lithuania&#x2019;s then-Culture Minister Simonas Kairys decided that performing Russian composer Pyotr Illyich Tchaikovsky&#x2019;s classic ballet &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; was no longer an appropriate way to celebrate the Christmas season. Lithuania is a staunch supporter of Ukraine, and Kairys, believing that Russian culture could not be separated from Russian imperialism, called for a &#x201C;mental quarantine&#x201D; &#x2014; otherwise known as &#x201C;cultural decolonization.&#x201D; At the end of last year, &#x160;ar&#x16B;nas Birutis, the newly installed culture minister, announced that he liked Tchaikovsky&#x2019;s music and saw no reason to prohibit it. Some Lithuanians agree, including another former minister of culture, who said: &#x201C;We fought Soviet power to get the freedom not to ban things.&#x201D; The Nutcracker debate in Lithuania echoes similar, though usually more fraught, arguments in Ukraine. In 2023, the Kyiv City Council decided that Russian music, plays, books, and art should no longer be showcased in public. Statues of Alexander Pushkin, one of Russia&#x2019;s greatest poets, were removed from public places. The patriotic urge to ban works of art associated with an enemy country is not new, of course. During World War I, some British people wanted to prohibit the performance of German music in concert halls, and there was even a proposal to replace German-made pianos with British-made models. When World War II came around, music played a very different role in Britain. The celebrated British pianist Myra Hess performed her famous lunchtime concerts in London during the Blitz. Hess, who was Jewish, saw no problem with playing music by the great German composers. To her, and to the Londoners who flocked to hear her, Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach belonged to the world, not to Germany alone. In Nazi Germany, the same music was performed on official occasions, such as Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s birthday, to demonstrate the superiority of German culture. Wilhelm Furtw&#xE4;ngler, the most famous German conductor at the time, would not have disagreed about the exalted status of German music, but he was not a Nazi. In his view, great music lifted people above politics and wartime propaganda, hence his refusal to leave his home country, or to stop performing there. German conductor and composer Wilhelm Furtwaengler acknowledges the applause of the audience after a concert by the Berlin Philharmonic in Berlin, Germany, on Jan.1, 1933. In the front row are (L-R) Herman Goering, Adolf Hitler, and Josef Goebbels. (Getty Images)The Nazis never banned all &#x201C;enemy culture&#x201D; either. Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays were performed in Germany throughout World War II, although &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; posed some problems: Shylock, the Jewish moneylender, might evoke a little too much sympathy. One of the aims of wartime propaganda is to demonize the enemy and portray them as less than human. Hollywood movies had been very popular in Japan (and in Germany) until December 1941. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese propaganda portrayed Americans as &#x201C;devils and beasts,&#x201D; and their devilish and beastly cultural products were swiftly taken out of circulation. So, is banning the art of another country ever a good idea? In principle, no. Tchaikovsky cannot be held responsible for Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s war of aggression. Withholding great works of art from the public will have a narrowing, provincializing effect. Artists like Ludwig van Beethoven, William Shakespeare, and Leo Tolstoy transcend borders. And yet, perhaps the Ukrainians should be given some slack. Britain was not in danger of being dominated by German culture during WWII, let alone forcibly assimilated into it. Putin&#x2019;s vision of building a broader &quot;Russkiy mir&quot; (Russian world) in which peripheral countries are subservient to the Kremlin, and their cultures are reduced to folkloric dances on official occasions, poses a fundamental threat to Ukraine&#x2019;s survival as an independent nation-state. To speak of cultural decolonization suggests a parallel between Ukraine and the former European colonies in Asia and Africa, where some local elites were indeed Anglicized or Francicized. But a better comparison would be to Korea under the Japanese Empire between 1910 and 1945. During this period, Koreans were not so much colonial subjects as widely despised second-class citizens. In the later stages of Japan&#x2019;s imperial rule, Koreans were forced to adopt Japanese names and be educated in Japanese. After Japan&#x2019;s defeat in World War II, Koreans, nearly robbed of their identity, also narrowed their cultural horizon by rejecting all things Japanese. It was only in the 1990s that Japanese movies, comic books, pop music, and literature began to re-enter South Korea, and they were not always well received. To those of us who espouse the principle of universal humanism, this kind of cultural chauvinism might seem provincial, if not bigoted. But Koreans were once fighting for their survival as a people. Culture was an existential matter. The same is true for Ukrainians today. Shunning Russian music, art, and literature, despite having deep historic links with such works, will not do much for universal humanism in Ukraine. But Ukrainians have more pressing concerns: they must fight to maintain their own distinct language and culture, as well as their own government. Once they secure their sovereignty, neither they, nor indeed the Lithuanians, will have any reason to fear Pushkin&#x2019;s poetry or Tchaikovsky&#x2019;s music.

Syrskyi sees 'gradual' improvement in scandal-hit French-trained brigade's capabilities	Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Jan. 23 that the French-trained 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Brigade is &quot;gradually acquiring certain combat capabilities&quot; after reports of poor command and training. The unit became a center of controversy after the Censor.net outlet uncovered rampant cases of mismanagement that led to high rates of losses and desertions. The brigade was deployed at the Pokrovsk sector, the most critical section of the front in Donetsk Oblast, in November 2024. &quot;All negative aspects and difficulties that arose during... (the brigade&#x2019;s) deployment in Ukraine have been analyzed, and the conclusions will be taken into account during the further training of service members,&quot; Syrskyi said after discussion with officers during his visit to the Pokrovsk sector. Censor.net&apos;s chief editor, Yurii Butusov, laid the blame for the brigade&apos;s poor performance on the Ukrainian military and political leadership, saying that France provided all the necessary support . Similarly, Syrskyi thanked France for being &quot;the first country to respond to the request to create a mechanized brigade and fulfilled all its obligations regarding the training and equipment.&quot; The scandal cast doubt on Ukraine&apos;s initiative to build fresh new brigades that would be trained and supplied with the support of Western partners. The 155th Brigade was to be the flagship unit of this project. Ukrainian authorities have launched an investigation into the brigade&apos;s mismanagement, with its former commander being reportedly detained earlier this week.	https://kyivindependent.com/syrskyi-sees-gradual-improvement-in-scandal-ridden-155th-brigades-capabilities/	2025-01-23T05:27:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1550396164.jpg
Zelensky clarifies comment on 200,000 peacekeepers, says figure depends on Ukrainian army size	President Volodymyr Zelensky on Jan. 23 clarified his earlier comments on the number of European peacekeepers needed to maintain peace in Ukraine, saying the required numbers would depend on the size of Ukraine&#x2019;s own military. The statement comes after Zelensky told a journalist at the World Economic Forum in Davos that at least 200,000 European soldiers would be needed for a stable peace deal. &quot;By the way, I didn&#x2019;t say we need 200,000 (peacekeepers)... A journalist asked me, I said, &apos;maybe more, maybe less,&apos;&quot; Zelensky said when asked about the statement in an interview with Bloomberg TV. Zelensky spoke in comparably stronger terms in Davos, saying: &quot;From all the Europeans? 200,000, it&#x2019;s a minimum. It&#x2019;s a minimum, otherwise it&#x2019;s nothing.&quot; The president explained in the interview that the size of the needed contingent will depend on the strength of the Ukrainian military. As Kyiv would struggle to maintain a million-strong army needed to repel a future Russian aggression, fielding such a force would depend on U.S. and European support, he explained. If the U.S. and Europe prove unwilling to help maintain such an army and Ukraine reduces it &quot;by 200,000, 300,000 or 500,000, it means that other troops have to replace them in those numbers,&quot; Zelensky added. The president&#x2019;s conclusion was that in the face of such options, Ukraine&#x2019;s accession to NATO is the cheapest way toward stable peace both for Ukraine and the West. At the same time, Zelensky admitted that some members &#x2013; namely the U.S., Germany, Slovakia, and Hungary &#x2013; remain reluctant to allow Ukraine into the alliance. Zelensky has been in contact with a number of European leaders about the prospects of a peacekeeping mission &#x2014; an initiative that French President Emmanuel Macron has spearheaded. During a visit to Kyiv on Jan. 16, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that his country will play its &quot;full part&quot; in supporting efforts to maintain an enduring peace in Ukraine. The idea has also found support from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called upon Europe to take up greater responsibility for Ukraine&#x2019;s security and pledged to bring a swift end to the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-clarifies-comment-on-200-000-peacekeepers/	2025-01-23T04:58:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194672328.jpg
Kremlin sees 'no new elements' in Trump's statement on sanctions against Russia	The Kremlin sees nothing new in U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s threats to impose sanctions if no deal on the war in Ukraine is reached, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Jan. 23 during his press briefing. A day earlier, Trump said that if a &quot;deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine was not reached soon, he would have no choice but to &quot;put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries.&quot; &quot;We don&apos;t see any particularly new elements here. You know that Trump, in the first iteration of his presidency, was the American president who most often resorted to sanctions methods,&quot; Peskov said. Russia is ready for an &quot;equal and respectful&quot; dialogue with the U.S., as it was during Trump&apos;s first term, Peskov added. The Kremlin spokesman also noted that no preparations are currently underway for a meeting between Trump and Putin. During the election campaign, Trump promised to end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours, though his choice for special Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, has since revised this to 100 days. The Trump team hopes to quickly begin work on a settlement plan that could be implemented within the first few months of his presidency. A meeting with Putin is part of the plan, according to CNN. Trump has often voiced sympathies for the Russian leader while criticizing the level of support the outgoing Biden administration gave to Kyiv. This prompted concerns that the new U.S. leadership might cut a deal unfavorable to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-sees-no-new-elements-in-trumps-statement-on-sanctions-against-russia/	2025-01-23T04:10:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245735181.jpeg
Russian cargo ship Sparta II docks in Syria after weeks drifting at sea, tracking data shows	A Russian cargo ship supposed to evacuate Russian military equipment from Russia&apos;s Tartus naval base in Syria has finally docked after spending weeks drifting in the Mediterranean, MarineTraffic data showed on Jan. 22. The Sparta II, a Russian cargo ship under U.S. sanctions, had been drifting near Tartus since Jan. 5 after leaving Baltiysk in Kaliningrad Oblast on Dec. 11. Following the December overthrow of Russian-backed dictator Bashar al-Assad by rebel forces, the new Syrian authorities refused to grant entry to the ship. Reports indicate that Russian forces have dismantled air defense radars and moved over 100 trucks of equipment to the port, but without access for Russian ships, personnel and equipment had been left stranded. The Insider reported on Jan. 21 that Syrian authorities had finally granted permission for the ship to dock, and MarineTraffic data shows it moored at Tartus as of Jan. 23. A circle marks the postion of the Sparta II on Jan. 23 as shown on MarineTraffic.com (MarineTraffic)But while Russia may now be able to evacuate some of its personnel and equipment, the Kremlin&apos;s long term presence at the Mediterranean port was thrown into doubt earlier this week when Syria canceled Russia&apos;s 49-year operating lease for Tartus. The contract, signed in 2019, had committed Moscow to invest at least $500 million in modernizing the port. With the agreement now void, all revenues from the port&apos;s operations will go directly to the Syrian state, and its management will revert to local authorities. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha addressed Russia&#x2019;s military presence in Syria during a Dec. 30 diplomatic visit to Damascus. According to Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi, Ukraine and the new Syrian leadership share similar views on the matter, though specific details were not disclosed.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-cargo-ship-sparta-ii-docks-in-syria-after-weeks-drifting-in-mediterranean/	2025-01-23T04:10:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screen-Shot-2025-01-23-at-13_21_06.png
Putin increasingly concerned about state of Russia’s economy, Reuters reports	Russian President Vladimir Putin appears increasingly concerned about the country&apos;s economy as U.S. President Donald Trump calls for an end to the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported on Jan. 23, citing five undisclosed sources. Throughout the nearly three years of full-scale invasion, Ukraine&apos;s Western partners imposed heavy sanctions on Moscow to undermine its ability to wage war. Initially, Russia has largely weather the sanctions, circumventing economic restrictions through third-party countries and various loopholes. The situation appears to be shifting as Russia has faced mounting economic challenges over the past months, compounded by labor shortages and military spending-induced inflation that led to record interest rates. Putin insisted that Russia would continue to fight as long as necessary and would not compromise its interests. At the same time, the Russian president acknowledged the pressure on the economy caused by the war, Reuters reported, citing its undisclosed source. Putin was also dissatisfied with the decline in private investment due to the high cost of credit. During a meeting with Russian business leaders in December, the president chided the economic bloc&apos;s top officials, according to two sources. In 2025, Russia has increased defense spending to a post-Soviet record level of 6.3% of GDP, which is one-third of budget expenditures, causing inflation. The economic situation in Russia has pushed some of the Russian elite to seek a negotiated settlement to the war, according to two sources familiar with the Kremlin&apos;s views. Trump has yet to present a detailed plan for peace in Ukraine, despite campaigning on promises to put a swift end to the conflict. While he frequently references his good relationship with Putin, his recent comments on Moscow have taken a somewhat harder line. The U.S. president recently urged Putin to &quot;make a deal&quot; on Ukraine, threatening with &quot;high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries&quot; if he fails to do so. Russia has thus far dismissed any reported peace proposals from the Trump administration and maintained its ambitions to fully occupy four Ukrainian regions &#x2014;Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. Trump has said that arrangements for a face-to-face meeting with Putin are currently underway.	https://kyivindependent.com/putins-concerns-about-russias-economy-growing-amid-trumps-calls-for-wars-end-reuters-reports/	2025-01-23T03:49:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1246326347.jpg
Russian forces suspected of killing 6 Ukrainian POWs in Donetsk Oblast	Ukrainian prosecutors are investigating a case of Russian troops summarily executing six Ukrainian captives in the embattled Donetsk Oblast, the Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office said on Jan. 23. The statement came in reaction to a video circulating on social media, recorded by Russian soldiers, that apparently shows the execution of the six prisoners of war (POW). Footage also shows a seventh Ukrainian soldier lying on the ground, whose fate is unknown. &quot;According to preliminary information, during an assault against Ukrainian positions in Donetsk Oblast, Russian soldiers took six Ukrainian soldiers captives and subsequently shot them,&quot; the Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office said in a statement. Executing prisoners of war is a serious violation of the Geneva Conventions and a war crime. Ukraine&#x2019;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said he had reached out to the U.N. and the International Committee of the Red Cross regarding the case. Throughout the full-scale war, Ukraine has documented widespread violations of the Geneva Conventions by Russian forces, including the execution of over 100 POWs in 2024 alone, according to Lubinets. Reports of torture, murder, and abuse of Ukrainian captives &#x2014; particularly in Donetsk Oblast &#x2014; have surged in recent months. Visual evidence of these atrocities continues to emerge, underscoring Russia&apos;s disregard for international law.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-apparently-kill-6-ukrainian-pows-in-donetsk-oblast/	2025-01-23T03:25:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2153450598.jpg
North Korea to send artillery units, 150 more ballistic missiles to aid Russia’s war, Budanov says	North Korea is expected to send reinforcements to Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, mainly gun and rocket artillery units, Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said in an interview with The War Zone magazine published on Jan. 23. Pyongyang is also expected to send 150 short-range KN-23 ballistic missiles to Russia in 2025, in addition to the 148 already supplied in 2024, according to the spy chief. Moscow is further set to receive additional 170 mm M1989 Koksan self-propelled artillery guns and M-1991 240 mm multiple launch rocket systems, Budanov noted, adding that North Korea provided 120 pieces of each of these systems in the past three months. The North Korean soldiers are expected to train their Russian counterparts on the supplied systems, he said. North Korea has shaped up to be Russia&#x2019;s key supporter in its war against Ukraine, providing extensive artillery ammunition, missiles, and a contingent of 12,000 troops who had joined Russia in assaults against the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast. Kyiv has said that North Korean troops have already suffered 4,000 casualties, though the number cannot be independently verified. Budanov did not provide further details on the number of North Korean reinforcements or the timeframe of their arrival. The New York Times reported that according to an undisclosed U.S. official, fresh Pyongyang troops could arrive within two months. Experts interviewed by the Kyiv Independent connected North Korea&#x2019;s high casualty rates to a lack of experience with modern warfare, the &quot;human wave&quot; tactics employed against entrenched Ukrainian positions, and the resolve of North Korean troops to avoid capture, even at the cost of their own lives. Only two North Korean soldiers are in Ukrainian captivity since Pyongyang deployed its troops in Kursk Oblast last fall. Russia has ramped up its efforts to push Ukrainian forces out of their positions in Kursk Oblast, held since early August 2024. The region is expected to play a key role in any negotiations amid U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s push for peace talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-to-send-artillery-units-150-ballistic-missiles-to-aid-russias-war-budanov-says/	2025-01-23T02:40:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2037956412.jpg
US podcaster Fridman plans to visit Russia, interview Putin after criticizing Zelensky	U.S. podcaster Lex Friedman plans to visit Russia to interview Russian President Vladimir Putin, Fridman said on Jan. 22 at Joe Rogan&apos;s podcast. The podcaster previously interviewed President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv. Following the interview, Fridman criticized the Ukrainian president on X, saying that Zelensky had spoken &quot;crude words&quot; towards Putin and that this would not facilitate negotiations. &quot;There&apos;s probably a lot to say about this war. I should say that I interviewed Volodymyr Zelensky, and I will be traveling to Russia to interview Vladimir Putin, and I&apos;m aware of the risks; I accept the risks, and the goal of the mission is just to push for peace,&quot; Fridman said on the podcast The Joe Rogan Experience. Fridman did not specify when he would visit Russia or whether he had already agreed to an interview with the Russian authorities. The Kremlin has not commented on Fridman&apos;s statement. The podcaster also added that he believes that U.S. President Donald Trump is capable of bringing peace closer. &quot;I think that both Zelensky and Putin fear Donald Trump. And that&apos;s a great person to then make peace. All of them believe, both Putin and Zelensky, that Trump would do some crazy shit,&quot; he said. With nearly five million subscribers on his YouTube channel, Fridman, born in Tajikistan and raised in Moscow, organized an interview with Zelensky that was published on Jan. 5 as part of what he described as his &quot;small part in pushing for peace.&quot; Fridman&apos;s show has previously hosted controversial figures, including Trump, entrepreneur Elon Musk, political commentator Vivek Ramaswamy, and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, some of whom have advanced narratives portraying Ukraine as a corrupt nation bent on escalating war with Russia. In a three-hour interview, Fridman tried to persuade Zelensky that Putin is &quot;a serious person who loves his country.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/fridman-plans-to-interview-putin/	2025-01-23T02:22:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1239295205-1.jpg
Ukraine is failing the mobilization test	Ukrainian society largely does not want to mobilize. Nearly 6 million Ukrainian men have not updated their information in military enlistment centers, and most of them likely don&apos;t have grounds for a deferment or exemption. Forced mobilization of these men is categorically opposed by society. Rosy-cheeked aunts gather and shout &quot;shame&quot; at military enlistment officers tasked with searching for draft dodgers. Society is also resistant to the mobilization of 25-year-old &quot;children.&quot; However, this sentiment does not extend to the sons of elites and deputies, who are readily and unhesitatingly deemed fit for the front lines. &quot;Let (former Ukrainian President Petro) Poroshenko&apos;s and (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky&apos;s sons fight,&quot; they say. There is also a reluctance to pay more taxes &#x2014; and I&#x2019;m not even addressing the other duties or requirements imposed during martial law. Furthermore, society is adamantly against sending soldiers from other branches of the military into infantry. Being in the infantry is not seen as an honor for Ukrainian soldiers but as something dirty and undignified &#x2014; a form of punishment. At the same time, society strongly opposes sending poorly trained recruits into infantry. Ten years of war and three years of full-scale invasion weren&apos;t enough to prepare Ukrainian men. Now, they must undergo at least six months of preparation, preferably abroad, where it&apos;s easier to avoid service. One can talk endlessly about drone warfare and a shortage of equipment and artillery, but it&apos;s the infantry that holds the front line. The front line stretches 3,000 kilometers, with active combat continuing on a third of it. Society is unwilling to answer the question of where the military command should find the personnel to maintain the line against a vastly superior enemy &#x2014; let the government solve this, but without mobilizing anyone and, God forbid, calling up 25-year-olds. Let the MPs, prosecutors, and police officers go to war. Never mind that there aren&apos;t enough MPs and prosecutors to form even one regiment, and police officers have already been fighting with full brigades from the start. Society has failed the test of maturity. The political opposition battles the government as though elections are just around the corner, despite the fact that elections cannot be held during martial law. Instead of seeking compromises with the opposition, the government prefers to keep political traitors and collaborators on a leash, cooperating with them while losing more and more credibility.

(Kostiantyn Liberov / Libkos / Getty Images)A Ukrainian soldier stands in a trench near Bakhmut, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on Oct. 25, 2023. (Kostya Liberov / Libkos / Getty Images)One can rightfully criticize the government for its failures. It&#x2019;s fair, they exist. But the government is a reflection of the views and politics of society. There is no demand for mobilization, and thus there is no adequate mobilization policy. There is no demand to transition the country&#x2019;s economy to a wartime footing, and so there are no corresponding unpopular decisions. However, the issue of the enemy&#x2019;s total advantage in infantry remains unresolved. Yes, our partners are right. If we want the world to protect democracy in Ukraine, Ukrainians themselves must be the first to defend our democracy. There will be no negotiations on terms that suit us while the enemy continues to seize more and more territory. It&#x2019;s time to remove the rose-colored glasses. The West favors strong partners, but as we retreat daily, we are not seen as strong, no matter how much weapons and money we receive. They are telling us this directly. Are there issues with military management? Of course. But if you believe this is some secret plan by spies working for the enemy within our General Staff, I pity you. That&#x2019;s conspiracy theory-level thinking, like believing the Earth is flat. What reforms can we talk about when the only goal of the military command is to hold the front line from collapsing and prevent the enemy from breaking through into our rear? All available reserves are being used. That&#x2019;s why we see mismatches of various units on small sections of the front line, leading to management problems. In my opinion, there is no point in discussing management reforms without creating reserves that would ensure the implementation of those reforms. Forming these reserves is purely a political issue that must be addressed with political decisions. This question should be directed to political leaders, not military command. Zelensky and Ukraine&apos;s parliament bear full responsibility for what is happening on the front line. These two political entities failed mobilization. To fix this, unpopular political decisions must be made, regardless of ratings and the opportunistic opposition, which will inevitably exploit this. Otherwise, we won&#x2019;t make it.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-is-failing-the-mobilization-test/	2025-01-23T01:28:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1749112458.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure 46 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least two people and injured at least 46 over the past day, including an infant, regional authorities reported on Jan. 23. Moscow&#x2019;s forces launched 92 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, as well as four Iskander-M or North Korean KN-23 ballistic missiles fired against Zaporizhzhia, according to the Air Force. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 57 drones, while 27 were lost in the airspace without inflicting damage, the Air Force said. Russia launched drones and missiles against the city of Zaporizhzhia overnight, killing a 47-year-old man and injuring at least 31 people, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. Twenty-two of the injured are hospitalized and are in a condition of medium severity. Among them is a two-month old baby, Fedorov said. The injured victims also included members of the State Emergency Service. One apartment building was destroyed and 30 were damaged in the city, in addition to damaged houses and non-residential buildings. A Russian airstrike against the city of Kostiantynivka in Donetsk Oblast killed one civilian and injured eight, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Fourteen houses, eight apartment buildings, and dozens of other buildings, infrastructure facilities, and cars were damaged. In Kherson Oblast, seven people were injured in Russian attacks, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. Twelve houses were damaged in the strikes.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-120/	2025-01-23T01:19:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/2025-01-23-11_15_22.jpg
Trump's national security adviser Waltz starts purging NSC, including aides working with Ukraine	U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz has launched a full vetting of the National Security Council (NSC) staff, including those working with Ukraine, in line with Donald Trump&apos;s America First agenda, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Jan. 23. Since returning to the White House, Trump has implemented significant changes in the new administration&apos;s staff. Trump&#x2019;s picks included candidates who have made controversial statements about Ukraine&apos;s support and ending the war. The &quot;full review&quot; aims to ensure that the NSC staff &quot;are committed to implementing President Trump&apos;s America First agenda to protect our national security and wisely use the tax dollars of America&apos;s working men and women,&quot; National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said in a statement. During a telephone call on Jan. 22, conducted by Waltz&apos;s chief of staff, Brian McCormack, NSC employees were told that they were to leave the office immediately. They were instructed that they could return only at the request of their supervisors, senior directors appointed by the Trump administration, the WP reported. According to the outlet, about 150 employees remained from the Biden administration, and the departure of such a large number of employees could complicate the administration&apos;s work during the transition period. Dozens of officials sent home on Jan. 22 had been assigned to the NSC from other government agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, the State Department, and the Pentagon. Those interested in staying with the NSC under Trump were asked to contact the human resources department and told that the new team would review those requests, according to three officials familiar with the matter. Trump has yet to present a detailed plan for peace in Ukraine, despite campaigning on promises to put a swift end to the conflict. While he frequently references his good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, his comments on Moscow in recent days have taken a somewhat harder line. When asked on Jan. 21 if he would impose additional sanctions if Putin refuses to negotiate, Trump replied: &quot;Sounds likely.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Jan. 21 Ukraine is actively working to arrange a meeting between him and Trump. &quot;We are your partner. We know all the sore spots; we have lost our people,&quot; Zelensky said, noting Trump&apos;s pledge to end the war in 2025. &quot;We want to end the war this year. But not just quickly, but fairly and, above all, reliably for us.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-national-security-adviser-waltz-starts-purging-nsc-including-those-working-with-ukraine/	2025-01-23T00:47:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2173993733.jpg
Kyiv announces release of 3 Ukrainian sailors from Houthi captivity	Editor&#x2019;s note: The story is being updated. Ukraine&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry and military intelligence agency secured the release of three Ukrainian crew members of the Galaxy Leader commercial vessel from the Houthi captivity in a &quot;joint operation,&quot; the ministry said in the statement on Jan. 23. The news comes as the Yemeni rebel group released the crew of the ship captured in November 2023 as part of attacks on vessels sailing through the Red Sea corridor. The decision is seen as part of de-escalation efforts in the wake of the Gaza ceasefire. In the statement, the Foreign Ministry did not provide further details on the release of the three Ukrainian citizens but said they are &quot;in the care of Ukrainian diplomats, are in good condition, and have all the necessary documents.&quot; The multinational crew of 25 also included sailors from Romania, Mexico, Bulgaria, and the Philippines. Ukraine has led talks on the release of its citizens since the vessel was captured, the ministry said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-secures-release-of-3-ukrainian-sailors-from-houthi-captivity/	2025-01-23T00:19:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2152897501.jpg

Depends what 'deal' means — Kremlin responds to Trump's sanctions threats	Russia will have to determine what U.S. President Donald Trump means by &quot;deal&quot; before entering into negotiations to end the full-scale war in Ukraine, Russia&apos;s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said on Jan. 22. Polyanskiy&apos;s remarks come shortly after Trump threatened to impose economic penalties on Russia if the country does not &quot;make a deal&quot; to end the war. &quot;If a deal is not reached, I will have no other choice but to put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries,&quot; he posted on his social media platform Truth Social earlier on Jan. 22. &quot;We can do it the easy way or the hard way.&quot; In response, Polyanskiy said Moscow would have to determine what Trump&apos;s aims are before it enters any agreements. &quot;It&apos;s not merely the question of ending the war,&quot; Polyanskiy told Reuters. &quot;It&apos;s first and foremost the question of addressing root causes of Ukrainian crisis. So we have to see what does the &apos;deal&apos; mean in President Trump&apos;s understanding.&quot; Trump has the opportunity to end Washington&apos;s current &quot;malicious policy&quot; against Russia, he added. Trump has yet to present a detailed plan for peace in Ukraine, despite campaigning on promises to put a swift end to the conflict. While he frequently references his good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, his comments on Moscow in recent days have taken a somewhat harder line. When asked on Jan. 21 if he would impose additional sanctions if Putin refuses to negotiate, Trump replied, &quot;Sounds likely.&quot; His team is reportedly devising a sanctions strategy to pressure Russia to the negotiating table. Russia has thus far dismissed any reported peace proposals from the Trump administration and maintained its ambitions to fully occupy four Ukrainian regions &#x2014;Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. Trump has said that arrangements for a face-to-face meeting with Putin are currently underway.	https://kyivindependent.com/depends-what-deal-means-kremlin-responds-to-trumps-sanctions-threats/	2025-01-22T21:35:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1388985966.jpg
Prigozhin’s Wagner Group accused of plotting attacks on Chevron, cooperating with Al Qaeda, leaked emails show	The late Russian warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin&apos;s Wagner mercenary force has been accused of plotting attacks against Western infrastructure in Africa, including U.S. oil company Chevron&apos;s pipelines, according to the leaked correspondence of Prigozhin&apos;s Concord Group obtained by Ukraine&apos;s 24 Channel. Another accusation is that Wagner mercenaries have allegedly cooperated with terrorists, including Al Qaeda, in Africa. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the information. The hacked correspondence contains numerous emails written by relatives of Wagner mercenaries killed in Ukraine, as well as mothers and fathers asking Prigozhin to hire their sons. The obtained emails shed light on a scandal involving food poisoning allegedly caused by the Concord Group. The group did not respond to a request for comment. Prigozhin, once a trusted confidant of Russian President Vladimir Putin, rose to infamy as the mastermind behind Wagner, Russia&apos;s most notorious mercenary force. Wagner fighters have left their mark across Africa, Syria, and Ukraine &#x2014; most notably in the grinding battles in the country&apos;s Donetsk Oblast, where they spearheaded Russia&apos;s offensive from 2022 to 2023. However, in June 2023, Prigozhin fell out with the Kremlin and led an armed rebellion, only to abruptly call it off after negotiations with Putin. Two months later, in August 2023, Prigozhin was killed in a plane crash, an incident that many independent observers have pinned on Putin as the likely orchestrator. In March 2021, Igor Smirnov wrote an email to Prigozhin&apos;s Concord Group that retired Russian officers were expected to take part in attacks on foreign infrastructure facilities in West Africa. Smirnov, allegedly a former Russian intelligence officer who allegedly worked for oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was attempting to frame or warn the group. He claimed that &quot;a group of Russians is contacting many armed groups in West Africa, including Ansaru, an Al Qaeda affiliate in Nigeria.&quot; &quot;In exchange for attacks on Western oil companies, jihadists are helping to arm militants in the Niger Delta under a direct agreement with the Russians,&quot; Smirnov said. &quot;After the first attacks on Western companies, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb will take responsibility for that.&quot; Supporters of Niger&apos;s National Council of Safeguard of the Homeland (CNSP) wave the Niger national flag (R) and flag bearing the logo of private military company Wagner, as they protest outside the Niger and French airbase to demand the departure of the French army from Niger, in Niamey on Sept. 16, 2023. (AFP via Getty Images)He also claimed that he had video and audio recordings implicating a Wagner mercenary in the negotiations about the attacks. &quot;All of this will soon come crashing down on your company, which destabilizes the situation in West Africa, cooperates with terrorists, and is waging an indirect war against the West,&quot; Smirnov added. In another email, Smirnov also accused Wagner Group of extorting money from U.S. oil company Chevron in exchange for the security of the company&apos;s pipelines in Nigeria. He claimed that the extortion had been &quot;documented by Khodorkovsky.&quot; He also attached a video that allegedly shows an associate of Wagner Group&apos;s chief of staff, Andrei Troshev, meeting with Nigerian warlord Asari Dokubo. This is not the first time Wagner mercenaries stand accused of illegal activities in Africa. Journalist Orkhan Dzhemal, film director Alexander Rastorguyev, and cameraman Kirill Radchenko were killed in the Central African Republic in 2018 while investigating the activity of Wagner mercenaries there. In 2019, Khodorkovsky&apos;s Dossier Center published an investigation according to which Wagner Group could have been behind the murder. Chevron and Khodorkovsky&apos;s press office did not respond to requests for comment. The emails obtained by the 24 Channel also reveal the consequences of Wagner Group&apos;s participation in Russia&apos;s offensives in Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk Oblast, including the Battle of Bakhmut, in 2022 and 2023. Wagner Group recruited thousands of convicts who were pardoned by Putin in exchange for military service. The convicts routinely took part in human wave attacks in Bakhmut and other areas, suffering disproportionately high casualties in the grinding offensives. Starting from January 2023, many people sent emails to Wagner asking the company about their killed relatives and compensation for their deaths. In January 2023, Ekaterina Merzlyak wrote that a 25-year-old Wagner fighter had been killed in December 2022 and later buried in the village of Krasnoselkup in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District. &quot;Fellow villagers are outraged that not a single representative of the local authorities showed due respect to the parents of our hero,&quot; she said. &quot;They did not assist with the organization of the funeral or with transportation. There was complete silence as if nothing had happened.&quot; Screenshot of Wagner mercenary group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin claiming to be on the African continent in a video published to the &quot;Razgruzka Vagnera&quot; Telegram channel linked to the mercenary group on Aug. 21, 2023. (Telegram)Merzlyak also wrote that his &quot;father had to transport the coffin himself with a trailer over a bumpy winter road for five hours, despite the fact that our administration finds it easy to bring in some singer by helicopter for City Day celebrations.&quot; The correspondence also contains emails written by prison inmates&apos; mothers asking Wagner to recruit their sons. &quot;Dear Yevgeny Viktorovich (Prigozhin), I am asking for your help! Please help my son redeem himself,&quot; one of them wrote to Prigozhin in November 2022. &quot;My son went to Moscow to earn a living. Unfortunately, he got into trouble there and ended up in pretrial detention.&quot; She wrote Prigozizhin &quot;to help my son get to the front,&quot; saying that &quot;he is very eager for your help!&quot; A man named Andrei Lapshin wrote in April 2023 that his 15-year old son, a cadet at a military school, is &quot;deeply engaged in the patriotic agenda, sees his future in the ranks of Russian law enforcement agencies and is an avid fan of Wagner Group.&quot; &quot;Therefore, I would like to ask for your help in possibly arranging a job for him during the summer break &#x2014; so that he doesn&apos;t waste his time working at some chain caf&#xE9; or as a courier, but rather gets involved in a real, serious, necessary, and useful task for our Motherland,&quot; Lapshin added. Some other emails were more critical of Wagner Group&apos;s activities. A woman named Dinara Satanova wrote in July 2023 that the hands of Wagner Group&apos;s leadership were &quot;stained with the blood of our children, husbands, and brothers.&quot; &quot;We are aware of the facts of killings, abuse, denial of medical assistance, and starvation, despite all efforts to conceal them,&quot; she said. Satanova said that Wagner&apos;s drive to recruit convicts was &quot;like slave trade from which the company made millions.&quot; &quot;You have destroyed and ruined our families, our children,&quot; she said. &quot;On what grounds were children under the age of 22 recruited? Mothers were not informed, and no consent was given.&quot; Apart from military activities, the correspondence covers Concord Group&apos;s food procurement schemes. In 2019, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny&apos;s team exposed Concord Group&apos;s low-quality food deliveries to schools and kindergartens in Moscow and St. Petersburg, which resulted in the poisoning of hundreds of children. Amid the scandal, many parents sent emails to Concord Group and demanded compensation. In response to the accusations, in August 2019, Prigozhin accused Navalny and his associate Lyubov Sobol of orchestrating the poisoning, according to the leaked correspondence. He claimed that Navalny and Sobol &quot;extorted 300 million rubles ($3 million) to avoid stirring up a scandal regarding the children.&quot; A portrait of late head of Wagner paramilitary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, displayed at a makeshift memorial in Moscow, Russia, on Aug. 27, 2023. (Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP via Getty Images)&quot;We have made significant progress in this investigation and do not rule out the possibility that the poisoning incident was the result of a blatant act of sabotage, as numerous facts suggest,&quot; Prigozhin said. &quot;As you know, Sobol is a person willing to commit any crime to become a politician... We have witnesses who confirm that Sobol was directly involved in the children&apos;s illness.&quot; He claimed that Sobol and Navalny &quot;could have been the masterminds and organizers of this terrible crime.&quot; Despite Prigozhin&apos;s claims, even a Russian court recognized in 2019 that Concord Group was to blame for the food poisoning and ordered it to pay compensation. Navalny himself survived a poisoning attempt in 2020. A joint investigation by The Insider, Bellingcat, CNN, and Der Spiegel revealed that Navalny had been poisoned with the Novichok nerve agent by agents of Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service. In February 2024, Navalny died in a Russian prison. Independent experts say that he was either killed intentionally or died due to harsh conditions and lack of medical treatment. Navalny&apos;s team did not respond to a request for comment.	https://kyivindependent.com/prigozhins-wagner-group-accused-of-plotting-attacks-on-chevron-cooperating-with-al-qaeda-leaked-emails-show/	2025-01-22T21:00:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1259010459.jpg
Russian attack in Zaporizhzhia injures at least 16	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia attacked the city of Zaporizhzhia in the early hours of Jan. 23, damaging a residential building and injuring at least 16 people, Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. The attack left at least 16 people wounded, Fedorov said. Four of the injured victims are employees of Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service. They are reportedly being treated at the hospital. Rescue operations are ongoing at the site as emergency workers search for victims who may be trapped beneath the rubble. According to Fedorov, at least four explosions occurred in Zaporizhzhia shortly after 4 a.m. local time. An aerial alert was issued over the region due to the threat of Russian ballistic missiles. The attack damaged residential buildings in the city, damaging a roof and smashing multiple windows, Fedorov said. Zaporizhzhia, home to approximately 710,000 residents before Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, is frequently targeted by Russian forces. An attack against an industrial facility in the city on Jan. 8 killed 13 people and injured 122, including a child.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-in-zaporizhzhia-injures-at-least-16/	2025-01-22T19:24:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/zapo.jpg
Zelensky meets with Serbian, Argentine presidents at Davos forum	President Volodymyr Zelensky held separate meetings with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Argentine President Javier Milei on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan. 22. Zelensky is leading a Ukrainian delegation at the forum, which takes place Jan. 20-24. His agenda includes bilateral talks with world leaders and meetings with top business officials. The meeting with Vucic centered on security guarantees and the two countries&apos; path to membership in the European Union, the Presidential Office said. Vucic has previously called Ukraine a &quot;friendly country&quot; and affirmed that Crimea and Donbas are sovereign Ukrainian territories, despite Serbia&apos;s historically warm relationship with Russia. During the meeting, Zelensky stressed to Vucic that &quot;sustainable peace must be supported by strong security guarantees.&quot; The leaders&apos; meeting comes a week after Vucic offered to host a potential meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Belgrade. Zelensky&apos;s meeting with Milei touched on matters of economic cooperation, recent global events, and cooperation with the U.S. following Trump&apos;s inauguration. Zelensky also issued a warm invitation for Milei to visit Ukraine. &quot;You are a much-awaited guest in Ukraine,&quot; the president said. &quot;I invite you to get to know the Ukrainian people, they love you very much. I want you to see with your own eyes how Ukrainians are fighting and what they are going through during this war. And I really want Ukrainians to feel how much you respect them.&quot; The leaders agreed to maintain high-level contacts between Ukraine and Argentina and discussed possibilities for developing trade and expanding economic cooperation. Milei has repeatedly expressed firm support for Ukrainian sovereignty in the face of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Zelensky visited Argentina in December 2023 to attend Milei&apos;s inauguration, and the two leaders held talks in Buenos Aires. Argentina in 2024 joined the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which meets regularly at the Ramstein Airbase in Germany to coordinate military aid for Ukraine, and international coalition for the return of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia. One of Zelensky&apos;s stated aims heading into the Davos forum was to meet with leaders from Latin America. Earlier in the day, Zelensky met with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz and Israeli President Isaac Herzog.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-with-serbian-argentine-presidents-at-davos-forum/	2025-01-22T19:06:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/davos.jpeg
SBU conducts 150 special operations in 3 days in large-scale security crackdown	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) conducted 157 special operations from Jan. 18-20, the agency said on Jan. 22. The SBU issued the announcement after reporting a wave of investigations, arrests, and charges in recent days. Suspects were accused of various crimes, including aiding Russia&apos;s war effort. The agency carried out 157 special operations from Jan. 18-20 in order to &quot;counter crimes that pose a threat to state security, territorial integrity and defense capabilities of our country,&quot; the SBU said. The actions resulted in 222 charges and 85 detentions, the agency said. The SBU also carried out 287 searches during the operations. According to the SBU, the three-day crackdown targeted 19 agents suspected to have carried out intelligence and sabotage activities on behalf of Russian special services. It also netted 24 individuals who allegedly harmed &quot;the economic interests&quot; of Ukraine. The SBU charged 63 people with participating in draft evasion schemes and 39 individuals with crimes related to the military, including embezzling from the state defense budget. Another seven were charged with illegal weapons trafficking, and seven others allegedly spread propaganda or otherwise posed threats to Ukraine&apos;s cybersecurity, the agency reported. President Volodymyr Zelensky on Jan. 18, the first day of the recent crackdown, praised Ukrainian law enforcement agencies for their investigations. &quot;Traitors and various schemes that weakened our state and our Ukrainian society are being countered,&quot; the president said. &quot;And anyone who stands against Ukraine or defies the laws of Ukraine must remember, that they will face a response.&quot; The SBU has announced high-profile arrests in recent days, including the detention of a well-known Dnipro lawyer who allegedly helped Russia carry out missile strikes and that of Ukraine&apos;s chief military psychaitrist, who is suspected of illicit enrichment activities. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-conducts-150-special-operations-in-3-days-in-large-scale-security-crackdown/	2025-01-22T18:00:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/SBU-badge.jpg
Russia could challenge EU's defense readiness within 5 years, Kallas says	European Union leaders are warning that Russia could test the bloc&apos;s readiness to defend itself within the next three to five years, calling for an increase in defense budgets and deepen military cooperation among member states. Speaking at a European Defense Agency meeting on Jan. 22, EU&apos;s chief diplomat Kaja Kallas stressed that the bloc must act decisively to counter Russia&apos;s growing militarization, with President Vladimir Putin allocating over one-third of his national budget to military spending &#x2014; three times what it was before the invasion of Ukraine. &quot;This is a heavily militarized country that presents an existential threat to us all,&quot; Kallas warned, citing intelligence reports suggesting that Russia is preparing for further provocations. &quot;We are running out of time. The Ukrainians are fighting for their freedom and ours. They are buying us time.&quot; German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius echoes Kallas&apos; concerns. Speaking with journalists in Lithuania, he has cautioned that Russia could be capable of attacking NATO territory within the next five to six years due to its rapid military industrialization. &quot;By 2029 or 2030, Putin could strengthen his army to the point where Russia would be capable of striking NATO,&quot; Pistorius said, according to Delfi. The minister also highlighted that Russia now produces more weapons and ammunition in months than the entire EU manufactures in a year. The EU has already committed over 130 billion euros in support to Ukraine, including nearly 50 billion euros in military aid. Member states have also trained 75,000 Ukrainian soldiers and imposed extensive sanctions on Russia. However, Kallas is adamant that more needs to be done. &quot;Russia is spending 9% of its GDP on defense, while EU member states collectively average only 1.9%. This sends a dangerous signal to the aggressor. Weakness invites them in,&quot; EU&apos;s top diplomat noted. To address these challenges, the EU is drafting a Preparedness Strategy that emphasizes stronger defense integration without forming a single European army. Instead, the plan focuses on enabling 27 capable national armies to work cohesively. &quot;We need investment from member states, the private sector, and the common EU budget. We must relay a message that we are serious about our commitment to European defense,&quot; Kallas said, highlighting the urgency of increasing production capabilities for weapons and military equipment. &quot;Ukraine is Europe&#x2019;s front line for defense,&quot; Kallas said, adding that Russia&#x2019;s military aggression has already been accompanied by hybrid warfare tactics, including cyberattacks, election interference, and sabotage across Europe. &quot;We need more, faster, and stronger support for Ukraine because the only language the Kremlin understands is the language of strength.&quot; While Russia&#x2019;s limited territorial gains in Ukraine have come at a high cost to its military and economy, EU leaders must remain cautious. &quot;Russia is not invincible, but neither is time on our side. We must prepare for the worst while striving for peace through strength.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-could-test-eus-readiness-to-defend-itself-in-3-to-5-years-time-kallas-says/	2025-01-22T15:50:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1401349176.jpg
US leadership essential in Ukraine peace efforts, Zelensky tells Bloomberg	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 22 that any effective peacekeeping force in Ukraine must include U.S. troops, emphasizing the critical role of the United States in deterring Russian aggression. Speaking with Bloomberg&apos;s Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Zelensky dismissed the idea that European allies could provide sufficient military support independently. &quot;It can&#x2019;t be without the United States,&quot; he said. &quot;Even if some European friends think it can be, no it can&#x2019;t be. Nobody will risk without the United States.&quot; As Donald Trump assumes office with plans to engage directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Zelensky seeks to secure long-term U.S. support while urging China to leverage its influence on Russia. Frustrated by limited communication with Chinese President Xi Jinping, he said: &quot;He can push Putin for peace, I&#x2019;m sure. President Trump is the strongest &#x2014; and Xi Jinping. I think there&#x2019;s no other ally who can really do it. His economy, Putin, depends very much on China.&quot; Zelensky stressed the importance of Ukraine&#x2019;s involvement in any negotiations about its future, warning against deals made without Kyiv&#x2019;s input, as he believes happened during the Minsk talks in 2015. &quot;We do not want this to happen behind the backs of Ukraine,&quot; he said. &quot;I very much believe that the U.S. won&#x2019;t do that, although I&#x2019;m not sure that earlier this did not happen. Here I&#x2019;m speaking not just about America, but some European partners.&quot; With Trump pledging a swift end to the war and planning talks with Putin, Zelensky is working to frame the negotiations as an opportunity for the U.S. to demonstrate strength. &quot;Ending the war should be a victory for Trump, not for Putin,&quot; he told Bloomberg, adding that without strong and irreversible security guarantees from the U.S. and Europe, a ceasefire could allow Russia to rearm and renew its offensive. &quot;The only question is what security guarantees and honestly I want to have understanding before the talks,&quot; he said. Zelensky has also faced challenges regarding domestic mobilization efforts, resisting pressure to expand conscription in Ukraine. Western allies, including the U.S., have urged lowering the age of conscription to bolster manpower. However, Zelensky argued that the focus should be on supplying weapons rather than drafting more soldiers. &quot;Why mobilize even younger people,&quot; he said. &quot;So that there are even more people without weapons?&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-tells-bloomberg-us-leadership-essential-in-ukraine-peace-efforts/	2025-01-22T14:46:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194672448.jpg
EU to allocate $36 billion of financial support to Ukraine	The European Union will provide 35 billion euros ($36 billion) in financial assistance to Ukraine in 2025 through the G7 ERA credit initiative and the Ukraine Facility program, European Commission&apos;s vice-president and trade commissioner announced on Jan. 22. Great to meet with @Svyrydenko_Y, Ukraine&#x2019;s First Deputy PM, at #Davos2025. We discussed enlargement and steps to bring &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1E6; closer to the &#x1F1EA;&#x1F1FA;EU&#x2019;s Single Market. The EU is delivering financial support through the G7 ERA loan initiative and the Ukraine Facility, with &#x20AC;35bn for 2025. pic.twitter.com/iHQpg6kl1I On Jan. 10, Ukraine received three billion euros ($3 .09 billion) from the EU, the first tranche of loans from the bloc funded by proceeds of frozen Russian assets. The money has been provided through the Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) initiative, in which G7 countries pledged to provide Ukraine with almost $50 billion loan, with the EU contributing around $20 billion. In December 2024, the U.S. Treasury Department announced a $20 billion loan to Ukraine as part of the ERA initiative, backed by the proceeds from approximately $300 billion in frozen Russian assets, primarily held in European countries, with smaller amounts in the United States and Japan.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-to-allocate-36-billion-of-financial-support-to-ukraine/	2025-01-22T13:25:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2151615401.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine's Special Forces say they killed 21 North Korean soldiers, show combat footage	Key developments on Jan. 22: Warning: Footage includes violent and graphic content. Soldiers of the 8th Regiment of Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces resisted a North Korean assault in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast for eight hours before retreating, killing 21 and wounding 40 soldiers, the unit said on Jan. 22. The statement comes as Russia ramps up efforts to push out Ukrainian troops entrenched in the western Russian region, deploying its North Korean allies in ground assaults. In a video shared by the Special Operations Forces, a large assault group of purportedly North Korean soldiers is seen crossing an open field and forest, followed by close combat footage with only dozens of meters between the two sides. In the end, graphic footage shows killed soldiers claimed to be North Koreans. &quot;At the ninth hour of the battle, the Special Operations Forces had only a third of their ammunition left. They spent the rest on destroying (North Korean forces),&quot; the Telegram post read. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage shared by Ukraine&apos;s Special Operation Forces that purports to show an engagement with North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Video released on Jan. 22, 2025. Contains graphic and violent content. (Special Operations Forces).The Ukrainian fighters held off the assault with small arms, grenade launchers, and snipers. Eventually, the Ukrainian troops retreated in two Humvees, the post read. North Korea deployed around 12,000 soldiers in Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion in August 2024 to bring the war to Russian territory. North Koren troops have suffered 4,000 casualties, both wounded and killed, President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed earlier in January 2025. In exchange for the troop transfer, Russia is paying over $2,000 for each North Korean soldier, though officials said it is unclear how much is allocated to individual soldiers and the Pyongyang government. A Kyiv court arrested General Yurii Halushkin, General Artur Horbenko, and Colonel Illia Lapin, three officers accused of leading an unsuccessful defense in Kharkiv Oblast during a Russian offensive last spring, Suspilne reported on Jan. 21. Russia launched a cross-border offensive into northeastern Kharkiv Oblast in May 2024, swiftly moving forward by several kilometers despite Ukraine&apos;s efforts to fortify border regions. Though the Russian offensive eventually stalled some 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Kharkiv, its initial success sparked outrage against regional and military leaders for poor defense planning. The three officers responsible for organizing the defenses were detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on Jan. 20. They were accused of violating military regulations and not using all resources at their disposal to repel the Russian offensive. &quot;This led to the seizure of part of the territory in the eastern Ukrainian region, where fierce fighting is currently ongoing,&quot; the SBU said. Halushkin commanded the Kharkiv Operational-Tactical Group, Horbenko led the 125th Territorial Defense Brigade that was deployed in the area, and Lapin commanded the brigade&apos;s 415th Battalion. The three suspects were charged with negligence in military service and &#x2014; in Horbenko&apos;s and Lapin&apos;s cases &#x2014; carrying out unauthorized withdrawal from the battlefield. They face up to 10 years in prison. &quot;The charged officials did not ensure the fortification and engineering arrangements of defensive positions (in Kharkiv Oblast). They did not ensure proper organization of units during the battle,&quot; the State Bureau of Investigation said. The suspects&apos; lawyers protested the charges. The trial comes against the backdrop of several scandals connected to poor command and organization in different brigades. Military mismanagement has often been cited as one of the key challenges plaguing Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces as it faces the Russian advance in the east. Russia lacks sufficient forces for a big breakthrough in Ukraine, NATO&apos;s Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, General Christopher Cavoli, said during a discussion on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan. 21. &quot;I&apos;m not worried that Ukraine could suddenly lose. I don&apos;t see the potential for a massive (Russian) breakthrough,&quot; Cavoli said. &quot;And this is not a political but a military vision. It&apos;s got to do with both sides, the effective defenses that the Ukrainians have been putting in, but also the difficulty that the Russian side has in generating significant offensive forces to be able to exploit a potential breakthrough.&quot; Russia quickly advanced in Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk Oblast in late 2024, making operationally significant gains near Toretsk, Chasiv Yar, and Kupiansk, as well as on its own soil in Kursk Oblast. Ukraine has struggled to contain the Russian offensive as Ukrainian forces are overstretched and dealing with manpower shortages. Despite Russian advances, Cavoli said Russia&apos;s slow and incremental push is &quot;exhausting&quot; for Moscow&apos;s forces. &quot;After all, there is a reason why Russia brought thousands and thousands of soldiers from North Korea,&quot; he added, referring to the 12,000-strong North Korean contingent dispatched to Kursk Oblast. &quot;I think we&apos;re going to continue to see this tension between the desire to attack and the lack of manpower on the part of the Russians. I think that will largely define the conflict and force the Russians to use more weapons of deterrence, as we&apos;ve seen them do in recent years.&quot; The general also said that though it remains unclear whether the U.S. will continue providing military aid packages under the Trump administration, he pointed to the &quot;very significant uplift in European aid&quot; provided to Ukraine. Recently inaugurated U.S. President Donald Trump criticized military aid for Ukraine during his campaign and, after his reelection, hinted at reducing it. Multiple media reports have nevertheless indicated that Trump does not intend to cut aid completely but wants to see Europe take up greater responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security. Russia wanted to install pro-Kremlin oligarch Viktor Medvedchuk as Ukraine&apos;s president after forcing President Volodymyr Zelensky to step down, the Ukrainian head of state said on Jan. 22, citing a Kremlin ultimatum he received in the early days of the full-scale war. &quot;Some people came to me on the first days of the war, some people from Ukraine&#x2026;They gave me the ultimatum from (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,&quot; Zelensky said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. &quot;They said that I have to go, and they will change me (for) Medvedchuk (as president).&quot; According to Zelensky, the ultimatum also demanded Ukraine recognize Russian occupation authorities in Donbas, change its constitution to commit to &quot;neutrality,&quot; shrink its army to 50,000 troops, give up much of its weapon arsenal, and recognize Russian as an official language of Ukraine. &quot;This was not a negotiation; it&#x2019;s an ultimatum,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that Russia&#x2019;s points were similar to those later presented during unsuccessful peace talks in 2022 that took place in Turkey. Formerly a Ukrainian lawmaker and businessman, Medvedchuk was among the leading pro-Russian figures in Ukraine before the full-scale invasion. He maintained close personal relations with Putin, who is the godfather of the oligarch&apos;s daughter. Medvedchuk was detained by Ukrainian authorities in 2022 and exchanged with Russia later the same year. Possible peace talks are again coming into focus as U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table. Zelensky said earlier during the forum that his country will seek to achieve a quick but just peace this year. The U.S. and European countries remained in contact with Russia throughout the full-scale war, namely on the level of intelligence agencies, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 22. &quot;The U.S. and Russia maintained contacts on various levels during the three years of the war&#x2026; and Europeans too,&quot; Zelensky said in a meeting with international journalists. Zelensky noted that &quot;diplomacy has to have an isolationist quality, just like sanctions. If the leaders don&apos;t talk, but the intelligence agencies are constantly in touch, then, in principle, this may suit Russia.&quot; The Western countries have largely cut official contacts with Russia following the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022. The international isolation imposed on the Kremlin appears to be weakening as U.S. President Donald Trump announced his intention to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss a potential peace deal. Commenting on the news that Trump plans to arrange a phone call with Putin, Zelensky said he is not surprised by Washington&apos;s efforts to establish contact with the Kremlin but believes Ukraine &quot;should be the priority because we are the allies of the U.S.&quot; Trump&apos;s new secretary of state, Marco Rubio, recently confirmed in an interview that the Trump administration will aim for a sustainable peace deal so that the war with Russia does not begin anew in two to four years. Trump said earlier if Putin does not come to the negotiating table, Moscow may face fresh economic sanctions. The Trump administration is working to attain a sustainable peace in Ukraine so that the war with Russia does not begin anew in two to four years, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Jan. 21. &quot;We are going to engage in making it (the war) end in a way that is sustainable, meaning we don&apos;t just want the conflict to end and then restart in two, three, or four years down the road,&quot; the recently confirmed top U.S. diplomat said on the CBS Mornings program. &quot;We want to bring stability.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump, who took office on Jan. 20, vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table and end the full-scale war nearing its third-year anniversary. He has revealed few details on how he plans to achieve that goal, though Rubio repeatedly said that both Ukraine and Russia will have to make concessions. &quot;It is a stalemate. It&apos;s a war that was started by Russia, but it is now a stalemate, a protracted bloody conflict,&quot; Rubio said on CBS Mornings, adding that the war has been &quot;incredibly destructive&quot; for both Ukraine and Russia. The secretary of state nevertheless said that Ukraine &quot;is paying the biggest price of all to its energy infrastructure, to the people, the lives that are lost, to the millions of Ukrainians that have had to leave their countries and are living overseas.&quot; Ukraine has struggled to contain the Russian advance as the battlefield began tilting in Moscow&apos;s favor in late 2024. Facing increasingly difficult manpower shortages, the Ukrainian military was forced to steadily cede ground to Russian forces in eastern Donetsk Oblast. In turn, Russia is believed to have lost between 700,000-800,000 soldiers killed and wounded, though it demonstrated the capability to replace the losses with new contract soldiers. The country&apos;s economy also faces economic headwinds amid soaring inflation and tightening sanctions against its energy sector. In a rare criticism, Trump said on Jan. 20 that Russian President Vladimir Putin is &quot;destroying Russia&quot; by not seeking a deal to end the war. The new U.S. president said he plans to soon meet his Russian counterpart, though he admitted uncertainty about whether the Kremlin&apos;s chief seeks a negotiated settlement. Since his electoral campaign in 2024, Trump has repeatedly claimed that the full-scale invasion would not have started if he had been in office at the time and pledged to broker an end within 24 hours. He and his team have since shifted rhetoric and acknowledged complexities in resolving the war. When asked about the expired 24-hour deadline, Rubio evaded commenting on any possible timeframe and merely said that ending the war would be the &quot;priority&quot; and &quot;policy of the United States.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump called on Russia to &quot;make a deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine on Jan. 22, warning that failure to reach an agreement would lead to increased sanctions, tariffs, and taxes on Russian goods. &quot;If a deal is not reached, I will have no other choice but to put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries,&quot; he posted on his social media platform Truth Social. &quot;We can do it the easy way or the hard way,&quot; said in reference to negotiating an end to the war, adding, &quot;the easy way is always better.&quot; While stressing that he is &quot;not looking to hurt Russia&quot; and maintaining that he has &quot;always had a very good relationship&quot; with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump added, &quot;It&apos;s time to &apos;Make a deal. No more lives should be lost.&quot; The statement comes as the Trump administration reportedly works on a sanctions strategy to advance a diplomatic solution to the conflict, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 16. Two primary approaches are under consideration. The first involves offering targeted relief to sanctioned Russian oil producers as an incentive if peace negotiations advance. The second calls for significantly expanding sanctions to increase pressure on Moscow, according to Bloomberg. His comments align with his previous vows to swiftly negotiate the war&apos;s end, though he has yet to present a detailed plan. When asked on Jan. 21 if he would impose additional sanctions if Putin fails to negotiate, Trump replied, &quot;Sounds likely.&quot; The Biden administration and the U.K. recently imposed their most extensive sanctions, targeting nearly 200 vessels in Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; key oil companies, and related entities, further tightening the economic noose around Moscow. Trump&apos;s efforts reportedly include plans to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and consultations with Putin.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-53/	2025-01-22T12:06:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/North-Korean-troops.png
Scandal-hit 155th Ukrainian Brigade commander in custody with $2.1 million bail, media reports	The former commander of the scandal-hit Ukrainian 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Brigade has been remanded in custody with a bail of Hr 90 million ($2.1 million), Hromadske reported on Jan. 22. The court&apos;s decision comes amid an investigation into allegations of poor leadership and widespread issues within the unit, which was deployed near Pokrovsk. The brigade, initially intended as a flagship project for Ukrainian military modernization, was trained and equipped with assistance from France and other foreign partners. French President Emmanuel Macron announced in June that France would provide training and military supplies, including AMX-10 armored vehicles, Caesar howitzers, and German Leopard 2A4 tanks. An investigation by Yurii Butusov, editor-in-chief of Censor.net, uncovered significant issues within the brigade. Butusov reported high numbers of soldiers going absent without official leave (AWOL) due to disorganization and poor leadership. The State Bureau of Investigation said on Jan. 20 that the brigade commander &quot;did not respond to violations in his unit, including the unauthorized abandonment of the military unit by his fighters.&quot; If convicted, the commander faces up to 10 years in prison. The brigade, which has approximately 5,800 troops, faced challenges from its inception. According to Butusov, 2,500 service members were reassigned to other units before training began, depleting its experienced personnel. Between March and November 2024, over 1,700 soldiers reportedly abandoned their posts, with an additional 50 deserting while training in France. Of the 1,924 soldiers sent to France for training, only 51 had more than a year of military service, while 1,414 had served fewer than two months. Replenishment efforts brought in new recruits, but Butusov claimed proper selection processes were often neglected, exacerbating the unit&apos;s operational challenges.	https://kyivindependent.com/commander-of-scandal-hit-155th-ukrainian-brigade-detained-with-2-1-million-bail-media-reports/	2025-01-22T11:51:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-20-at-15_59_41.png
Ukraine's OnlyFans content creators declare more than $7 million in income	Ukraine&apos;s tax service is looking to collect taxes on Ukrainians&apos; income made on the the subscription-based site OnlyFans, widely known for being an adult content platform, despite pornography being illegal in the country. After the country&apos;s tax service sent out requests to Ukrainian citizens who earn money on the platform, 451 people sent in declarations totaling Hr 326.1 million ($7.76 million) for the period of 2020-2022, Ekonomichna Pravda reported on Jan. 22, citing information requested from the country&apos;s tax service. Ukraine&apos;s tax authorities said it had requested data from the U.K.&apos;s tax service on Ukrainian earnings on OnlyFans for the period from 2020-2022, Ekonomichna Pravda reported. OnlyFans is owned by the British company Fenix &#x200B;&#x200B;International Limited. Ukraine&apos;s tax service refused to disclose how many Ukrainian citizens were earning money on OnlyFans, but said it had sent out 4,429 requests to Ukrainians to declare their income from the site. Only 451 people, or 10% of those contacted, filed declarations. These filings revealed a total tax liability of Hr 63.2 million ($1.5 million) in personal income and military taxes. It is unclear what type of content those who responded to the request for declaration are creating on OnlyFans. Although OnlyFans is known for adult content, it hosts a variety of materials, including fitness tutorials, cooking lessons, and behind-the-scenes content from artists. Ukraine&apos;s tax service also told Ekonomichna Pravda that it had received a court order to pass along information on Ukrainians earning money on the site to a law enforcement agency, without specifying which one. The media outlet reported a day earlier that Ukraine&apos;s Bureau of Economic Security was provided the names of Ukrainians earning income on the platform, and had begun carrying out searches of models and bringing charges against them under Article 301 of the criminal code that deals with the production of pornography. Kyiv has looked to increasing tax revenues as a means to bolster its wartime budget amid Russia&apos;s ongoing war. But as pornography and adult content, which makes up a lot of the activity on OnlyFans, remains illegal in Ukraine, its users have largely avoided declaring income from the site out of fear of legal repercussions. Ukraine&apos;s strict anti-pornography laws have created complications for creators. The legal framework prohibits the production and distribution of pornography, with broad interpretations leading to prosecutions even for consensual sharing of intimate images. &quot;OnlyFans already pays taxes in Ukraine. But for &apos;Ukrainian actors,&apos; even if they want to pay taxes, it is impossible. It would be an admission of guilt,&quot; Opposition lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said late last year. OnlyFans as a company pays taxes in Ukraine through the country&apos;s taxes on electronic services. Efforts to change the laws surrounding pornography are underway. A bill to decriminalize pornography was registered in late 2024 for the second time in recent years and gained support from the Verkhovna Rada&apos;s specialized law enforcement committee in December. Zhelezniak, who has supported amending the laws around pornography in Ukraine, said late last year that there are more than 5,000 people in the country currently making money through OnlyFans.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-on-onlyfans-declared-7-76-million-amid-legal-ambiguities-media-reports/	2025-01-22T11:39:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/Website---Porn-5.png
Ukraine's energy giant DTEK to invest $468 million in expanding Black Sea wind power plant	Ukraine&apos;s largest private energy company, DTEK, announced plans on Jan. 22 to invest 450 million euros ($468 million) in expanding the Tyligulska Wind Power Plant near the Black Sea coast. DTEK, which is owned by Ukraine&apos;s richest man Rinat Akhmetov, lost nearly 90% of its generation capacity in 2024 due to Russia&apos;s aerial attacks targeting Ukraine&apos;s power grid. The company said it reached a financing deal with lenders to purchase 64 wind turbines from Danish manufacturer Vestas, a world leader in turbine production. By expanding the facility from 19 to 83 turbines, the project aims to increase the wind farm&apos;s capacity fourfold, from 114 megawatts (MW) to 500 MW, DTEK said. The project is expected to be completed by late 2026 and generate 1.7 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity annually, enough to power 900,000 Ukrainian homes. Of the 450-million-euro investment, 370 million euros ($385 million) will be financed through bank loans guaranteed by Denmark&apos;s state-owned Export and Investment Fund (EIFO), with the remainder funded by DTEK. &quot;The commitment is the largest private sector investment in Ukraine since russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022 and the biggest ever private investment in Ukraine&#x2019;s energy sector,&quot; the company said in a press release. The Tyligulska plant, which became operational in May 2023, is located in Mykolaiv Oblast, approximately 400 kilometers south of Kyiv, and consists of 19 Danish company Vestas-supplied wind turbines. DTEK signed a memorandum of understanding with Vestas in December 2023, aiming to construct the largest wind farm in Eastern Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-energy-giant-to-invest-468-million-in-expanding-black-sea-wind-power-plant/	2025-01-22T10:51:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/_19R5572.jpeg
How Ukraine lost faith in the Red Cross and UN	Seeing the face of Ukrainian soldier Maksym Kolesnykov light up with joy over an apple upon his release from Russian captivity last February was enough to bring anyone to tears. During nearly a year in captivity, Kolesnykov lost over 30 kilograms and could not walk freely due to a severe injury in his left leg. Yet the only international organization he should have been able to rely on was never there for him. &quot;Not once did I see a representative of the Red Cross,&quot; Kolesnykov, now 47, told the Kyiv Independent. Like Kolesnykov, most Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) have never been visited by the representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) while in Russian captivity, says Ukraine&apos;s Human Rights Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets. Upon their release, numerous Ukrainian POWs revealed the horrific conditions they had endured in Russian prisons, facing near starvation, torture, and humiliation.

(Kostiantyn Liberov / Libkos / Getty Images)Ukraine&#x2019;s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of POWs said in October that &#xA0;177 Ukrainian soldiers have &quot;died from torture and inhumane treatment&quot; while in captivity. But international organizations &quot;turn a blind eye,&quot; says Lubinets. Kolesnykov recalls conditions in the Russian prison improving only slightly during an internal inspection by the Russian Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office. He believes that if the ICRC had been present, it might have prompted the prison staff to treat POWs better. &quot;I think their (the ICRC) appearance could have changed something for us. Maybe some conventions would have been followed, or the (prisoners&apos;) physical state would have been documented,&quot; says Kolesnykov. &quot;Any oversight in such a criminal situation would be good.&quot; With the start of the Russian full-scale war, Ukraine seems to have lost faith in major international bodies like the ICRC and the United Nations (U.N.) Once seen as pillars of global humanitarian aid, both organizations have been widely criticized by Kyiv for not doing enough, effectively undermining their authority and the very concept of international institutions as a cornerstone of the West. The relationship between Ukrainian officials and civic society, and international organizations has deteriorated since the start of the full-scale war. Myroslava Kharchenko, a lawyer with the NGO Save Ukraine, recalls asking the Ukrainian branch of the ICRC for a vehicle to evacuate children from Russian-occupied Kyiv Oblast early in the war, hoping its emblem would deter Russian attacks. According to Kharchenko, the ICRC refused, citing mandate limitations and also declined to provide body armor for volunteers. &quot;We didn&apos;t ask them to go there personally, to risk their lives; we were going to do it ourselves, but they refused,&quot; Kharchenko says. President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized the ICRC for similar cases at the time, saying that it &quot;says a lot&quot; about the organization. As the war went on, the criticism escalated: Ukraine denounced both the U.N. and the ICRC for insufficient or delayed humanitarian responses, including when Russian troops blew up the Kakhovka Dam in June 2023, resulting in a major flood in the south of Ukraine. &quot;They are not there,&quot; Zelensky told the Bild media outlet at the time. Just a few hours after Russian forces destroyed the dam in Kherson Oblast, causing a humanitarian and ecological disaster, the U.N. posted on X to mark its annual Russian Language Day. &#xA0; &quot;Russian commanders will have given the order to blow up the Kakhovka Dam in Russian (language). What a day at the U.N. to celebrate the Russian Language!&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry said in response. Russian commanders will have given the order to blow up the Kakhovka Dam in Russian. What a day at the UN to celebrate Russian language! @UnitedNationsRU tweets about cultural diversity, ignoring the biggest catastrophe in Europe in decades caused solely by Russia. Why be silent? https://t.co/8z5PIyfs8P That has once again prompted a discussion in Ukrainian society about whether Russia&apos;s place in various U.N. bodies and the U.N.&apos;s lenient attitude toward Russia should be reconsidered. Zelensky has called for the U.N. Security Council to strip Russia of its veto power multiple times: &quot;All the U.N. actions &#x2014; either by the Security Council or the General Assembly &#x2014; that could have stopped this aggression are shattered by the privilege granted by this seat to the aggressor.&quot; &quot;Veto power in the hands of the aggressor is what has pushed the U.N. into a dead end,&quot; Zelensky said at the U.N. Security Council on Sept. 20, 2023. Last fall, the heads of both the ICRC and the U.N. faced backlash in Ukraine again. In September, ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric met with the Russian Presidential Commissioner for Children&apos;s Rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, who, alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin, is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for their involvement in the forced deportation of thousands of Ukrainian children.

(Alexander Kazakov / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)In her social media post, Lvova-Belova even thanked the ICRC for its support in &quot;reuniting the families&quot; since the start of the full-scale war. According to the Ukrainian national database, Russia has deported over 19,500 Ukrainian children from occupied territories since Feb. 24, 2022. Although it&apos;s not part of the ICRC&apos;s mandate to &quot;counter&quot; the deportation of children, supporting it is &quot;the height of cynicism,&quot; Kharchenko says. On Oct. 24 &#x2014; United Nations Day which marks the anniversary of the day in 1945 when the U.N. Charter entered into force &#x2014; the U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres took part in the BRICS summit in the Russian city of Kazan, despite facing sharp criticism. Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) greets UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres (L) during their bilateral meeting at the BRICS Leaders&apos; Summit in Kazan, Tatarstan Republic, Russia, on Oct. 24, 2024. (Contributor / Getty Images)He also met Putin there, with a photograph of their handshake blasted by Ukrainians, as well as several Western officials on social media. Before that, Guterres had declined Ukraine&apos;s invitation to the first global peace summit in Switzerland, held last summer. In response, Zelensky also reportedly rejected Guterres&apos; visit to Ukraine. &quot;Although even some of its functionaries prefer the temptations in Kazan to the content of the U.N. Charter, our world is built in such a way that the rights of nations and the norms of international law matter and will matter,&quot; Zelensky said on Oct. 24, alluding to Guterres&apos; actions. The treatment of Ukrainian POWs in Russian captivity remains one of the most pressing issues for Ukrainian society. Multiple reports have revealed torture, inhumane conditions, and executions of POWs in captivity, while Ukraine also indicates minimal access to its POWs by the ICRC. Petro Yatsenko, a representative of the Ukrainian Coordination Center for the Treatment of POWs, says there are &quot;many things that the ICRC is currently unable to monitor within Russia.&quot; While the ICRC claims to have paid over 3,000 visits to POWs on both sides, it never specifies how many of them were to see Ukrainian POWs in Russia, Yatsenko says, adding the number is &quot;extremely low.&quot; &quot;This is a form of manipulation directed at both Ukrainian and international society,&quot; he says. &quot;We demand the ICRC recognize that they can not effectively carry out their mandate within Russia or in the detention facilities set up in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine,&quot; Yatsenko says. According to the Ombudsman&apos;s office, Russia &quot;fundamentally ignores&quot; the mandates set by international humanitarian law for the ICRC and U.N. bodies, especially regarding the treatment of Ukrainian POWs and civilians in captivity. &quot;Despite having the authority, the ICRC and U.N. structures continue to demonstrate &apos;concern and a neutral approach,&apos; which in practice equates to inertia, despite numerous calls from the Ukrainian side to intensify their activities,&quot; the Ombudsman&apos;s office said in a comment for the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It encourages Russia to disregard basic international norms,&quot; it added. On Nov. 20, Ukraine presented the &#x201C;Moscow Convention&#x201D; campaign aimed at exposing Russia&apos;s systemic violations of the Geneva Conventions as well as drawing attention to the ICRC and the U.N.&#x2019;s &#x201C;neutral stance.&#x201D; A Ukrainian soldier who was previously held captive poses for a portrait while undergoing rehabilitation in an unspecified location in Ukraine, on June 6, 2024.

(Kostiantyn Liberov / Libkos / Getty Images)Based on testimonies from former POWs and their families, the printed &quot;Moscow Conventions&quot; replicate the structure of the original Geneva Conventions but highlight the vastly different &quot;standards&quot; practiced by Russia, such as electric shock torture, physical and psychological abuse, sexual violence, and murder. &quot;Russians treat the Geneva Conventions as mere scraps of paper, something they can blatantly ignore and dismiss,&quot; Lubinets said during the presentation. &quot;Meanwhile, the ICRC has spent this entire time burying its head in the sand&#x2026; not befitting for a professional organization that should be upholding its mandate with dignity,&#x201D; he added. Patrick Griffiths, the spokesperson for the ICRC delegation in Ukraine, says their neutrality is a tool that &quot;works best&quot; for them when it comes to reaching POWs on both sides. &quot;Every decision that we make about what we say or don&apos;t say, what we do or what we don&apos;t do in this armed conflict, the first thought we have is, will it help the people that our mandate is to help?&quot; Griffiths says. &quot;And it&apos;s not in their interests for us to say something that risks losing the humanitarian access that we have limited though it already is, we acknowledge that,&quot; he says. Although the ICRC wants to be able to visit every POW, it is the &quot;obligation of the state&quot; which holds them to grant access, which they can not enforce, Griffiths says. Yatsenko, however, dismissed Griffiths&#x2019; arguments, calling them &quot;excuses&quot; that offer &quot;no constructive solution.&quot; &quot;If we had seen a significant number of changes during these two and a half years of Russian aggression, and if these excuses influenced changes in access for the ICRC to places of detention, then it would be justified. But we do not see such changes,&quot; he says. &quot;Something needs to be changed here.&quot; Even if Ukraine says a million times that it&apos;s not happy with the ICRC&apos;s work &quot;it will not change anything,&quot; says Mikhail Savva, a legal expert from the Center for Civil Liberties, a Ukrainian human rights organization. According to Savva, the biggest issue is that the 1949 Geneva Conventions do not provide any sanction tools; hence, they do not give the ICRC any &quot;enforcement mechanisms.&quot; &quot;It is necessary to raise the issue that the Red Cross (ICRC), and not only it but Ukraine as a state, should have tools to compel any aggressor country to comply with the norms of international humanitarian law,&quot; Savva says. Developing and signing an &quot;additional protocol&quot; to the Geneva Conventions is necessary for that, Savva says, adding that it should have the &quot;same authority as the conventions and should take into account the three years of wartime experience.&quot; A protester holds a placard expressing her opinion during a demonstration in Lviv, Ukraine, on July 31, 2022. (Pavlo Palamarchuk / SOPA Images / LightRocket via Getty Images)Yet he says it would be impossible without the will of state parties to the Geneva Conventions, the same as removing Russia from the U.N. Security Council. Oleksandr Pavlichenko, the Executive Director of the Ukrainian Helsinki Human Rights Union, believes that currently &quot;there is neither a legal means nor political will&quot; to strip Russia of its status in the Security Council. &quot;It would set a precedent for stripping a permanent member of the Security Council of that status. I believe other members, like the U.S., would not want to set such a precedent, as it could later lead to questions about potentially losing their own status, for example.&quot; Savva agrees, saying that &quot;under current legal conditions, this is practically impossible.&quot; &quot;It would mean dismantling the U.N. and creating other organizations. But would that impact the global situation?&quot; he says, adding: &quot;Russia would still have nuclear weapons and remain free from any restrictions altogether.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/how-ukraine-lost-faith-in-red-cross-and-un/	2025-01-22T10:13:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/photo_2024-01-03_18-39-34.jpg

We can do it the easy way or the hard way,' Trump says to Russia on ending the war in Ukraine	U.S. President Donald Trump called on Russia to &quot;make a deal&quot; to end the war in Ukraine on Jan. 22, warning that failure to reach an agreement would lead to increased sanctions, tariffs, and taxes on Russian goods. &quot;If a deal is not reached, I will have no other choice but to put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and other participating countries,&quot; he posted on his social media platform Truth Social. &quot;We can do it the easy way or the hard way,&quot; said in reference to negotiating an end to the war, adding, &quot;the easy way is always better.&quot; While stressing that he is &quot;not looking to hurt Russia&quot; and maintaining that he has &quot;always had a very good relationship&quot; with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump added, &quot;It&apos;s time to &apos;Make a deal. No more lives should be lost.&quot; The statement comes as the Trump administration reportedly works on a sanctions strategy to advance a diplomatic solution to the conflict, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 16. Two primary approaches are under consideration. The first involves offering targeted relief to sanctioned Russian oil producers as an incentive if peace negotiations advance. The second calls for significantly expanding sanctions to increase pressure on Moscow, according to Bloomberg. His comments align with his previous vows to swiftly negotiate the war&apos;s end, though he has yet to present a detailed plan. When asked on Jan. 21 if he would impose additional sanctions if Putin fails to negotiate, Trump replied, &quot;Sounds likely.&quot; The Biden administration and the U.K. recently imposed their most extensive sanctions, targeting nearly 200 vessels in Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; key oil companies, and related entities, further tightening the economic noose around Moscow. Trump&apos;s efforts reportedly include plans to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and consultations with Putin.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-urges-russia-to-make-a-deal-on-ukraine-warns-of-harsher-sanctions/	2025-01-22T08:47:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192427196.jpg
In photos: Grinding war in Donetsk Oblast through the lens of photojournalist-turned-soldier	When Oleg Petrasiuk began taking photos in 2009, photography was only meant to be a side gig to earn some money while in college. Eventually, it became his life&#x2019;s work. After Russia launched its all-out war against Ukraine, Petrasiuk was drafted to serve in Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces. He didn&#x2019;t let go of the camera. Petrasiuk now serves in the press service of the 24th Separate Mechanized Brigade, holding ground in the embattled Chasiv Yar, Donetsk Oblast. The 33-year-old photographer, who previously covered the war for the European Pressphoto Agency, now regularly catches the reality of Russia&#x2019;s all-out invasion as part of the military press service. &#x201C;(Front line) is exactly where I should be, next to them,&#x201D; Petrasiuk said, referring to the battle-hardened soldiers from the 24th who have been fighting on the eastern front for over two years. &#x201C;Time passes, and what remains are memories and photos,&#x201D; he said. The Kyiv Independent publishes photos taken by Oleg Petrasiuk while serving in the 24th Separate Mechanized Brigade in Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk Oblast.

Zelensky touts Ukraine's potential in meeting with global investors at Davos forum	President Volodymyr Zelensky met leading American and European executives and business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 22, emphasizing Ukraine&apos;s investment potential and the importance of international support in achieving a just peace. Participants discussed avenues to support Ukraine&apos;s war effort and economic recovery, with Zelensky spotlighting the advancements of Ukraine&apos;s defense sector, according to a statement published to the president&apos;s website. &quot;Ukraine has produced millions of kamikaze and reconnaissance drones, and it even uses them in logistics to deliver water, food, and medicine. These innovations will benefit not just wartime efforts but also peacetime applications,&quot; Zelensky said at the meeting. The meeting was part of the forum&apos;s &quot;Big Business Leaders to Ukraine&quot; panel, which included Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo and French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot. Zelensky&apos;s statement did not disclose the names of the investors who attended the meeting. &quot;Investments in Ukraine, our defense industry, support for our economy, development of the agricultural sector, energy, and education, along with maintaining sanctions pressure on Russia, were the key topics of our important conversation,&quot; Zelensky wrote on Telegram after the meeting. The discussions also extended to cooperation in agriculture, education, and energy, with attendees pledging continued investments to create jobs and facilitate Ukraine&apos;s post-war recovery, Zelensky&apos;s official website says. Ukraine&apos;s delegation at Davos this year has sought to highlight the country&apos;s economic potential and investment appeal, framing the country as a &quot;prize, not a burden.&quot; Events held at the Ukraine House, the country&apos;s pavilion at the forum, have focused on Ukraine&apos;s vast natural resources, and defense and agricultural sectors. The delegation&apos;s website says Ukraine holds $26 trillion in mineral wealth, including one-third of Europe&apos;s lithium reserves and significant gas reserves. 0:00/1&#xD7;President Volodymyr Zelensky met with top executives and business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 22 (Volodymyr Zelensky / Telegram)The Davos forum, themed &quot;Collaboration for the Intelligent Age,&quot; has gathered 3,000 participants from over 130 countries, including 60 world leaders. Ukraine&apos;s Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, speaking to Bloomberg on Jan. 22 &#xA0;on the sidelines of the forum, noted that foreign companies are ready to invest in Ukraine but require robust security guarantees to mitigate military risks. &quot;They need a guarantee &#x2014; like NATO membership, a military presence, or anti-missile systems to protect industrial zones and cities,&quot; she said. Ukraine&apos;s defense industry has expanded sixfold in the past year, and the country is ready to promote projects in reconstruction, defense, and resource extraction, including uranium deposits critical for reducing European reliance on China and Russia, Svyrydenko said. Zelensky&apos;s administration is reportedly exploring partnerships with the newly inaugurated U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s administration, particularly in processing and extracting rare earth minerals. With Trump&apos;s business experience and Ukraine&apos;s wealth of resources, Kyiv is hoping to secure deals that bolster economic recovery and strengthen global support for its post-war future.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-highlights-ukraines-investment-potential-seeks-global-investors-at-davos-forum/	2025-01-22T08:17:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194513510.jpg

What Trump’s 90-day pause on US foreign development assistance means for Ukraine	Hours after taking office, U.S. President Donald Trump put a stop on U.S. foreign development assistance for 90 days to review and ensure it aligns with the new administration&apos;s policy. Ukraine tops the recipient list of U.S. development assistance, receiving over $17 billion in economic aid in 2023 as it faced Russian all-out war, official data shows. According to the White House statement, it is now up to the U.S. State Secretary Marco Rubio or his designee to determine whether to request to continue, modify, or cease each foreign aid program based upon the review recommendations. &quot;Under President Trump, the top priority of the United States Department of State will be the United States. The direction he has given for the conduct of our foreign policy is clear,&quot; Rubio said before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week. &quot;Every dollar we spend, every program we fund, every policy we pursue must be justified by the answer to one of three questions: Does it make America safer? Does it make America stronger? Or does it make America more prosperous? &quot; Then-nominee for Secretary of State, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), testifies during his Senate Foreign Relations confirmation hearing at Dirksen Senate Office Building in Washington, DC, U.S. on Jan. 15, 2025. (Kevin Dietsch / Getty Images)What does this mean for Ukraine?Experts told the Kyiv Independent that Trump&apos;s move does not apply to funding programs through which the U.S. provides Ukraine with military aid. Artur Koldomasov, a Ukrainian expert on U.S. politics, says that the order is aimed at taking certain actions, but it cannot override existing legislative mechanisms or procedures. Trump can freeze funding for initiatives conducted by international organizations on human rights, refugee support, etc., according to the expert. &quot;In the context of this particular decision, it is quite difficult to imagine the implementation of this idea since the funds allocated for these initiatives have already been distributed, and the next budget will be adopted in September,&quot; Koldomasov said. But the order may apply to financial and humanitarian aid programs for Ukraine under the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), he said. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale, USAID has provided Ukraine with $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and more than $30 billion in direct budget support. The agency has also allocated funds to restore Ukraine&apos;s energy grid, which Russia is trying to destroy by launching barrages of missiles and drones. Oleksandr Kraiev, an expert on North American policy at the foreign policy think tank Ukrainian Prism, said that Trump&apos;s decision does not threaten Ukraine&apos;s support now. &quot;One way or another, our assistance still depends primarily on the decision of the Congress,&quot; he added. 155 mm artillery shells that are ready to be shipped are stored at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, U.S. on April 12, 2023.

(Wolfgang Schwan / Anadolu via Getty Images)What is Trump&apos;s position on Ukraine aid?The future of U.S. aid to Kyiv under Trump&apos;s administration remains uncertain. During the inaugural speech, he did not mention Ukraine, claiming that the U.S. &quot;will stop all wars.&quot; Yet, his full plan on how to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war remains unclear, too. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly criticized the level of support provided to Ukraine and signaled Kyiv should brace for reduced assistance once he takes office. When asked in early December whether Ukraine should prepare for such a scenario, Trump responded: &quot;Possibly, sure.&quot; In 2024, the pro-Trump wing of the Republican Party blocked the U.S. aid bill in Congress for months. This led to the fall of the key eastern city of Avdiivka in Donetsk Oblast, followed by the loss of several other towns in the region. The $61 billion aid bill was passed by the U.S. Congress in April, giving the former President Joe Biden around $10 billion in Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA), which allows the U.S. to supply Kyiv with military equipment from existing military stockpiles. Around $3.8 billion remained unspent. Now, these funds are at Trump&apos;s disposal. Yet, the majority of U.S. funding remains in the hands of the U.S. Congress. &quot;So far, despite the large number of Trump&apos;s orders, despite his executive activity, not even half of them can be implemented,&quot; Kraiev said. &quot;You can plan and write all kinds of plans, but if you don&apos;t have the money to implement them, then these plans risk simply remaining plans.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-orders-90-day-pause-in-us-foreign-development-assistance-is-ukraines-aid-at-risk/	2025-01-22T07:17:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194362860-2.jpg
One-fifth of Ukrainians would move abroad if travel restrictions were lifted, survey shows	Some 21% of Ukrainians would want to move abroad if all travel restrictions were lifted, according to a survey by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation and the Razumkov Center published on Jan. 21. Men aged 18-60 are not allowed to leave the country except for specific cases since Ukraine imposed martial law at the outbreak of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Should the borders open again for all citizens, 70% of the respondents said they would not want to move to another country for permanent residence, while 21% said they are ready to do so, according to the survey. According to the survey, men and younger people were more keen to move abroad &#x2014; 25% and 33%, respectively. Only 9% of respondents over 60 expressed willingness to move abroad. Around 4.2 million Ukrainian refugees reside in the European Union under temporary protection status, with the largest numbers living in Germany and Poland. The main motivations for moving abroad included &#xA0;&quot;lack of opportunities for development (30.5%), threat to life due to hostilities (29%), insufficient social support from the state (29%), desire to reunite with relatives (26%), desire to take relatives who depend on the respondent away from the country (23%), and inability to find a job,&quot; the survey read. The poll, carried out between Nov. 29 and Dec. 14, 2024, involved face-to-face interviews with 1,518 respondents from Ukrainian-controlled territories. An exodus of the working-age population would be certain to increase labor shortages and threaten to plunge Ukraine deeper into the demographic crisis it has been facing since the start of the full-scale invasion. The U.N. predicted that in the worst-case scenario, Ukraine&apos;s population could shrink from 37.441 million in 2024 to just 15.3 million people by 2100.	https://kyivindependent.com/one-fifth-of-ukrainians-would-move-abroad-if-borders-open-survey-shows/	2025-01-22T06:09:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1760543042.jpg
Russia lacks manpower for major breakthrough in Ukraine, top NATO general says	Russia lacks sufficient forces for a big breakthrough in Ukraine, NATO&apos;s Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, General Christopher Cavoli, said during a discussion on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan. 21. &quot;I&apos;m not worried that Ukraine could suddenly lose. I don&apos;t see the potential for a massive (Russian) breakthrough,&quot; Cavoli said. &quot;And this is not a political but a military vision. It&apos;s got to do with both sides, the effective defenses that the Ukrainians have been putting in, but also the difficulty that the Russian side has in generating significant offensive forces to be able to exploit a potential breakthrough.&quot; Russia quickly advanced in Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk Oblast in late 2024, making operationally significant gains near Toretsk, Chasiv Yar, and Kupiansk, as well as on its own soil in Kursk Oblast. Ukraine has struggled to contain the Russian offensive as Ukrainian forces are overstretched and dealing with manpower shortages. Despite Russian advances, Cavoli said Russia&apos;s slow and incremental push is &quot;exhausting&quot; for Moscow&apos;s forces. &quot;After all, there is a reason why Russia brought thousands and thousands of soldiers from North Korea,&quot; he added, referring to the 12,000-strong North Korean contingent dispatched to Kursk Oblast. &quot;I think we&apos;re going to continue to see this tension between the desire to attack and the lack of manpower on the part of the Russians. I think that will largely define the conflict and force the Russians to use more weapons of deterrence, as we&apos;ve seen them do in recent years.&quot; The general also said that though it remains unclear whether the U.S. will continue providing military aid packages under the Trump administration, he pointed to the &quot;very significant uplift in European aid&quot; provided to Ukraine. Recently inaugurated U.S. President Donald Trump criticized military aid for Ukraine during his campaign and, after his reelection, hinted at reducing it. Multiple media reports have nevertheless indicated that Trump does not intend to cut aid completely but wants to see Europe take up greater responsibility for Ukraine&apos;s security.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-lacks-manpower-for-major-breakthrough-in-ukraine-top-nato-general-says/	2025-01-22T05:12:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2148294550.jpg
Russia issued ultimatum to Ukraine in 2022 to replace Zelensky with Medvedchuk, president says	Russia wanted to install pro-Kremlin oligarch Viktor Medvedchuk as Ukraine&apos;s president after forcing President Volodymyr Zelensky to step down, the Ukrainian head of state said on Jan. 22, citing a Kremlin ultimatum he received in the early days of the full-scale war. &quot;Some people came to me on the first days of the war, some people from Ukraine&#x2026;They gave me the ultimatum from (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,&quot; Zelensky said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. &quot;They said that I have to go, and they will change me (for) Medvedchuk (as president).&quot; According to Zelensky, the ultimatum also demanded Ukraine recognize Russian occupation authorities in Donbas, change its constitution to commit to &quot;neutrality,&quot; shrink its army to 50,000 troops, give up much of its weapon arsenal, and recognize Russian as an official language of Ukraine. &quot;This was not a negotiation; it&#x2019;s an ultimatum,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that Russia&#x2019;s points were similar to those later presented during unsuccessful peace talks in 2022 that took place in Turkey. Formerly a Ukrainian lawmaker and businessman, Medvedchuk was among the leading pro-Russian figures in Ukraine before the full-scale invasion. He maintained close personal relations with Putin, the godfather of the oligarch&apos;s daughter. Medvedchuk was detained by Ukrainian authorities in 2022 and exchanged with Russia later the same year. Possible peace talks are again coming into focus as U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table. Zelensky said earlier during the forum that his country will seek to achieve a quick but just peace this year.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-issued-ultimatum-in-2022-to-force-out-zelensky-install-medvedchuk-president-says/	2025-01-22T04:41:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1193640358.jpg
Well-known' Dnipro lawyer detained for allegedly aiding Russian missile strikes	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) detained a lawyer from Dnipro suspected of aiding Russian missile strikes against the city and then attempting to flee the country, the SBU said on Jan. 22. The agency did not reveal the suspect&apos;s identity but described him as a &quot;well-known local lawyer&quot; and one of the most &quot;deeply undercover FSB (Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service) agents in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.&quot; The man, detained while allegedly attempting to flee across the Polish border at the Krakivets checkpoint, was accused of providing Russia with coordinates for a strike that killed six people and seriously injured 30 in Dnipro on Dec. 29, 2023. The attack damaged a shopping center, a maternity hospital, a house, administrative buildings, and at least two dozen high-rise buildings. The suspect is said to have provided Russia with coordinates for a local enterprise, workshops, and drone warehouses to help &quot;inflict maximum damage.&quot; He then passed information on the consequences of the attack and provided coordinates for another strategic facility in Dnipro, according to the SBU. The lawyer maintained contact with a senior member of the Russian occupation administration in Crimea and with FSB officers, Ukrainian prosecutors said. The suspect was charged with treason and justifying Russian aggression and faces life in prison. Dnipro is the regional center of the central-eastern Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and Ukraine&apos;s fourth-largest city, serving as an important logistics and medical hub for the front since the outbreak of the full-scale invasion. Multiple deadly drone and missile strikes have targeted the city since 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/well-known-dnipro-lawyer-detained-for-allegedly-aiding-russian-missile-strikes/	2025-01-22T04:12:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-22_10-00-02.jpg
Ukraine's Special Forces say they killed 21 North Korean soldiers, show combat footage	Warning: Footage includes violent and graphic content. Soldiers of the 8th Regiment of Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces resisted a North Korean assault in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast for eight hours before retreating, killing 21 and wounding 40 soldiers, the unit said on Jan. 22. The statement comes as Russia ramps up efforts to push out Ukrainian troops entrenched in the western Russian region, deploying its North Korean allies in ground assaults. In a video shared by the Special Operations Forces, a large assault group of purportedly North Korean soldiers is seen crossing an open field and forest, followed by close combat footage with only dozens of meters between the two sides. In the end, graphic footage shows killed soldiers claimed to be North Koreans. &quot;At the ninth hour of the battle, the Special Operations Forces had only a third of their ammunition left. They spent the rest on destroying (North Korean forces),&quot; the Telegram post read. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage shared by Ukraine&apos;s Special Operation Forces that purports to show an engagement with North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast.

Eventually, the Ukrainian troops retreated in two Humvees, the post read. North Korea deployed around 12,000 soldiers in Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion in August 2024 to bring the war to Russian territory. They have suffered 4,000 casualties, both wounded and killed, President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed earlier in January 2025. In exchange for the troop transfer, Russia is paying over $2,000 for each North Korean soldier, though officials said it is unclear how much is allocated to individual soldiers and the Pyongyang government.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-special-forces-say-they-killed-21-north-korean-soldiers-show-combat-footage/	2025-01-22T03:22:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/North-Korean-troops.png
Zelensky meets German opposition leader, Israeli president at Davos forum	President Volodymyr Zelensky separately met with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz and Israeli President Isaac Herzog on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan. 22. Talks between Zelensky and Merz focused on &quot;necessary efforts and coordinated actions with allies to achieve a just and lasting peace,&quot; the Presidential Office said. Merz is the chancellor candidate of the conservative CDU/CSU alliance for the parliamentary elections in February. The German politician, who met Zelensky in Kyiv last December, has urged Berlin to provide more decisive support to Ukraine and supported the provision of long-range Taurus missiles. Speaking to Merz in Davos, Zelensky &quot;underscored the critical importance of Germany approving an additional 3 billion euros ($3.1 billion) defense support package for Ukraine.&quot; German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has blocked the approval of additional funds for Ukraine unless they are paid through additional borrowing, drawing criticism from his coalition partners. Merz&apos;s party, whose support is crucial for passing the funding since Scholz&apos;s coalition lost the majority in the parliament, backed the additional funding for Ukraine but insisted the federal budget can cover it without abandoning the debt break. Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky (L) meeting Israeli President Isaac Herzog on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 22, 2025. (Presidential Office)During his meeting with the Israeli president, Zelensky highlighted &quot;shared challenges facing their nations and agreed on areas for future cooperation, particularly in the field of security.&quot; Ukraine has sought to secure Israel&apos;s backing in the war with Moscow, arguing that the Russian-Iranian alliance presents a shared enemy to both Kyiv and Tel Aviv. The outreach has been largely unsuccessful, with Israel staying out of the Russia-Ukraine war while fighting its own conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. The Ukrainian president also said that Ukraine understands &quot;the pain of having loved ones held in captivity and share the joy when people return home from captivity.&quot; The Palestinian militant group Hamas recently released three Israeli hostages in the first phase of a ceasefire deal between the group and Tel Aviv.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-german-opposition-leader-israeli-president-in-davos/	2025-01-22T02:38:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/209e6dbdb982be1d2cbaace19be00376_1737496161_extra_large.jpeg
Ukraine's NATO prospects depend on Trump, Zelensky says	Ukraine&#x2019;s ascension to NATO ultimately rests on U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s will, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 21. &quot;Everything depends on the United States. If Trump is ready to see Ukraine in NATO, we will be in NATO, everyone will be in favor. If President Trump is not ready to see us in NATO, we will not be in NATO,&quot; Zelensky told journalists. Zelensky also named four countries &#x2014; Germany, Hungary, Slovakia, and the United States&#x2014; that currently do not want Ukraine to join the military alliance. Politico reported last year that other countries, such as Belgium, Slovenia, or Spain, are also in opposition, even though they are less vocal about their stance. There is little evidence that the new Trump administration would be more open to accepting Ukraine into NATO than former U.S. President Joe Biden. Trump even attacked Biden over alleged support for Kyiv&apos;s aspirations, claiming it provoked Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Ukraine did not obtain any definitive commitments from Western partners on its NATO membership ahead of the full-scale invasion and, as of 2025, has yet to receive a membership invitation. A report by The Wall Street Journal has previously suggested that Trump&#x2019;s team was exploring a plan to delay Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership by at least 20 years in exchange for Western arms supplies and European peacekeepers to monitor a potential ceasefire with Russia. Moscow has already rejected the proposal, with Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly seeking a permanent ban on Ukraine&apos;s entry into the alliance in expected talks with Trump. Kyiv submitted its application to join in September 2022, and in July 2024, the alliance affirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-nato-prospects-depend-on-trump-zelensky-says/	2025-01-22T02:08:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194511049.jpg
Kyiv court arrests 3 senior officers accused of failed defense of Kharkiv Oblast	A Kyiv court arrested General Yurii Halushkin, General Artur Horbenko, and Colonel Illia Lapin, three officers accused of leading an unsuccessful defense in Kharkiv Oblast during a Russian offensive last spring, Suspilne reported on Jan. 21. Russia launched a cross-border offensive into northeastern Kharkiv Oblast in May 2024, swiftly moving forward by several kilometers despite Ukraine&apos;s efforts to fortify border regions. Though the Russian offensive eventually stalled some 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Kharkiv, its initial success sparked outrage against regional and military leaders for poor defense planning. The three officers responsible for organizing the defenses were detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on Jan. 20. They were accused of violating military regulations and not using all resources at their disposal to repel the Russian offensive. &quot;This led to the seizure of part of the territory in the eastern Ukrainian region, where fierce fighting is currently ongoing,&quot; the SBU said. Halushkin commanded the Kharkiv Operational-Tactical Group, Horbenko led the 125th Territorial Defense Brigade that was deployed in the area, and Lapin commanded the brigade&apos;s 415th Battalion. The three suspects were charged with negligence in military service and &#x2013; in Horbenko&apos;s and Lapin&apos;s cases &#x2013; carrying out unauthorized withdrawal from the battlefield. They face up to 10 years in prison. &quot;The charged officials did not ensure the fortification and engineering arrangements of defensive positions (in Kharkiv Oblast). They did not ensure proper organization of units during the battle,&quot; the State Bureau of Investigation said. The suspects&apos; lawyers protested the charges. The trial comes against the backdrop of several scandals connected to poor command and organization in different brigades. Military mismanagement has often been cited as one of the key challenges plaguing Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces as it faces the Russian advance in the east.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-court-arrests-generals-over-unsuccessful-defense-in-kharkiv-oblast/	2025-01-22T01:45:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-20_14-00-12.jpg
Western intelligence agencies kept contact with Russia during full-scale war, Zelensky says	The U.S. and European countries remained in contact with Russia throughout the full-scale war, namely on the level of intelligence agencies, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 21. &quot;The U.S. and Russia maintained contacts on various levels during the three years of the war&#x2026; and Europeans too,&quot; Zelensky said in a meeting with international journalists. Zelensky noted that &quot;diplomacy has to have an isolationist quality, just like sanctions. If the leaders don&apos;t talk, but the intelligence agencies are constantly in touch, then, in principle, this may suit Russia.&quot; The Western countries have largely cut official contacts with Russia following the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022. The international isolation imposed on the Kremlin appears to be weakening as U.S. President Donald Trump announced his intention to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss a potential peace deal. Commenting on the news that Trump plans to arrange a phone call with Putin, Zelensky said he is not surprised by Washington&apos;s efforts to establish contact with the Kremlin but believes Ukraine &quot;should be the priority because we are the allies of the U.S.&quot; Trump&apos;s new secretary of state, Marco Rubio, recently confirmed in an interview that the Trump administration will aim for a sustainable peace deal so that the war with Russia does not begin anew in two to four years. Trump said earlier if Putin does not come to the negotiating table, Moscow may face fresh economic sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/western-intelligence-agencies-kept-contact-with-russia-throughout-full-scale-war-zelensky-says/	2025-01-22T00:48:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194513510.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure 29 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least two people and injured at least 29 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 22. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, three people were injured in Russian attacks against the Synelnykove district on Jan. 21, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. Close to 70 houses in the area were damaged. Russian strikes killed one civilian and injured another in Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. Two more people were reportedly injured in the town of Bilytske. In Kharkiv Oblast, 10 people were injured over the past day, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Three police officers and two civilians were wounded during a drone attack in the town of Kupiansk on the morning of Jan. 21. Later the same day, Russian attacks injured an 87-year-old woman in the Bilyi Kolodiaz village, three women in Kupiansk, and a 62-year-old woman in the Borshchivka village. Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast killed one civilian and injured 11, said Oleksandr Prokudin, the regional governor. Two high-rise buildings and seven houses were damaged. A Russian drone strike against the city of Mykolaiv in Mykolaiv Oblast injured a 74-year-old woman and a 59-year-old man and damaged a six-story residential building, Governor Vitalii Kim reported. The woman is in serious condition.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-119/	2025-01-22T00:17:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-22_09-41-11.jpg
Top Putin aide's son investing in the West despite sanctions, media reports	Vladimir Kiriyenko, son of Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s Deputy Chief of Staff Sergei Kiriyenko, has continued making investments in the West through offshore companies despite sanctions, The Moscow Times reported on Jan. 21. Kiriyenko, the CEO of the Russian social media site Vkontakte, holds shares in at least one venture capital fund and maintains ownership in various offshore companies registered in the British Virgin Islands and Barbados, according to documents seen by The Moscow Times. The son of one of Russia&apos;s most influential men, Kiriyenko was appointed to head the Gazprombank-owned social site Vkontakte at the age of 38. His father, Sergey Kiriyenko, served as Russia&apos;s prime minister in 1998 and is currently Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s deputy chief of staff. He was a leading figure in organizing Russia&#x2019;s sham elections in the occupied Ukrainian territories in 2023 and has been described as one of the chief architects of Russian disinformation and propaganda operations. According to The Moscow Times, Vladimir Kiriyenko went to court in the British Virgin Islands to claim shares of his Titanium VC fund to be transferred from offshore company Yalecrest to him. In a document he signed, the worth of shares to be transferred amounted to $500,000. Titanium VC Limited, partially owned by Kiriyenko, is an investment fund that was launched with $50 million in 2013. It has focused on Israeli startups that were later acquired by tech companies from the United States. Since 2022, Kiriyneko has been sanctioned by the U.S., the U.K., and the EU, among other countries. His social media network, VKontakte, is one of the most popular sites in Russia. It was banned in Ukraine in 2017 due to the Russian government&apos;s influence over its administration and its storing of data in Russian servers.	https://kyivindependent.com/top-putin-aides-son-investing-in-the-west-despite-sanctions-media-reports/	2025-01-21T23:46:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1198921235.jpg
US seeks 'sustainable' peace in Ukraine to avoid new war in '2-4 years,' Rubio says	The Trump administration is working to attain a sustainable peace in Ukraine so that the war with Russia does not begin anew in two to four years, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Jan. 21. &quot;We are going to engage in making it (the war) end in a way that is sustainable, meaning we don&apos;t just want the conflict to end and then restart in two, three, or four years down the road,&quot; the recently confirmed top U.S. diplomat said on the CBS Mornings program. &quot;We want to bring stability.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump, who took office on Jan. 20, vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table and end the full-scale war nearing its third-year anniversary. He has revealed few details on how he plans to achieve that goal, though Rubio repeatedly said that both Ukraine and Russia will have to make concessions. &quot;It is a stalemate. It&apos;s a war that was started by Russia, but it is now a stalemate, a protracted bloody conflict,&quot; Rubio said on CBS Mornings, adding that the war has been &quot;incredibly destructive&quot; for both Ukraine and Russia. The secretary of state nevertheless said that Ukraine &quot;is paying the biggest price of all to its energy infrastructure, to the people, the lives that are lost, to the millions of Ukrainians that have had to leave their countries and are living overseas.&quot; Ukraine has struggled to contain the Russian advance as the battlefield began tilting in Moscow&apos;s favor in late 2024. Facing increasingly difficult manpower shortages, the Ukrainian military was forced to steadily cede ground to Russian forces in eastern Donetsk Oblast. In turn, Russia is believed to have lost between 700,000-800,000 soldiers killed and wounded, though it demonstrated the capability to replace the losses with new contract soldiers. The country&apos;s economy also faces economic headwinds amid soaring inflation and tightening sanctions against its energy sector. In a rare criticism, Trump said on Jan. 20 that Russian President Vladimir Putin is &quot;destroying Russia&quot; by not seeking a deal to end the war. The new U.S. president said he plans to soon meet his Russian counterpart, though he admitted uncertainty about whether the Kremlin&apos;s chief seeks a negotiated settlement. Since his electoral campaign in 2024, Trump has repeatedly claimed that the full-scale invasion would not have started if he had been in office at the time and pledged to broker an end within 24 hours. He and his team have since shifted rhetoric and acknowledged complexities in resolving the war. When asked about the expired 24-hour deadline, Rubio evaded commenting on any possible timeframe and merely said that ending the war would be the &quot;priority&quot; and &quot;policy of the United States.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-seeks-stable-peace-in-ukraine-rubio-says/	2025-01-21T23:08:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193483462.jpg

This number includes 1,950 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,844 tanks, 20,485 armored fighting vehicles, 34,837 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,194 artillery systems, 1,262 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,050 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 23,039 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-823-980-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-21T22:22:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1870879319.jpg
Nominee for US ambassador to UN says Trump needs 'maximum flexibility' to end Ukraine war	Elise Stefanik, U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s nominee for United Nations ambassador, said on Jan. 21 that Trump should be given &quot;maximum flexibility&quot; to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war in Ukraine. Trump nominated Stefanik, a Republican congressmember and Trump loyalist with a mixed record on Ukraine support, for the ambassador role shortly after his election win. When asked how she would use her position at the U.N. to hold Russia accountable for its war crimes in Ukraine, Stefanik said her concern was supporting Trump&apos;s attempts to negotiate a peace agreement. &quot;I support President Trump&apos;s commitment to bringing this war to a resolution to stop the killing,&quot; Stefanik said at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Stefanik defended her record in the U.S. House of Representatives, saying she has &quot;a very strong record when it comes to deterring Russia.&quot; She also referenced her vote in favor of supplying lethal military aid to Ukraine during Trump&apos;s first term. &quot;I believe that peace through strength is our strongest deterrence,&quot; she said, echoing a phrase from Trump&apos;s inaugural address. &quot;(M)y effort will be supporting President Trump&apos;s mission to bring that to a resolution and to deter Russia in the long term.&quot; Stefanik did not detail any possible sanctions or other accountability measures against Moscow or Russian President Vladimir Putin. When asked again about efforts to penalize Russia for human rights abuses, Stefanik reiterated the importance of supporting Trump&apos;s agenda. &quot;Certainly it&apos;s going to be important to support President Trump&apos;s approach with his special envoy to address and bring that to a resolution, and I will work with the National Security Council and my colleagues in the cabinet who sit in the national security spaces to use this position at the United Nations to support his strategy and give him maximum flexibility to bring this to a resolution.&quot; Trump has repeatedly promised to negotiate a swift end to the war in Ukraine. His special Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, said the administration aims to negotiate a ceasefire within 100 days of taking office. The goal represents a change from Trump&apos;s previous pledge to end the war within 24 hours. Both Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky are reportedly arranging upcoming meetings with Trump.	https://kyivindependent.com/nominee-for-us-ambassador-to-un-says-trump-needs-maximum-flexibility-to-end-ukraine-war/	2025-01-21T21:35:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194552422.jpg
Indian banks block Russian oil payments after new US sanctions	Indian banks has begun blocking payments for Russian oil imports following the latest round of U.S. sanctions against Russia&apos;s oil industry, according to a report from Energy Intelligence, an energy information company. The U.S. on Jan. 10 announced large-scale sanctions against major Russian oil companies and nearly 200 vessels of Moscow&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet.&quot; Following the new restrictions, financial institutions in India began blocking payments for Russian crude, Energy Intelligence reported on Jan. 20. India&apos;s state-owned banks, State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank, have exercised the most caution in avoiding U.S. sanctions. Private banks have adopted a less rigid approach, the report said. India became the world&apos;s leading importer of Russian oil following the full-scale invasion of February 2022 and subsequent barrage of Western sanctions. India accounted for almost half of all Russian seaborne crude exports in 2024. Approximately 20% of those exports originated from Surgutneftegas and Gazprom Neft, Russian oil companies targeted in Washington&apos;s recent sanctions, according to S&amp;P Global. Sanctioned shadow fleet tankers reportedly transported 450,000 barrels of crude to India per day. Sanctioned Russian tankers that were booked before the sanctions went into effect on Jan. 10 will be allowed to unload at ports in India until March 12, the end of a U.S. grace period, an official told Bloomberg. Refineries in India have already entered agreements to buy crude from Oman and the United Arab Emirates, Reuters reported on Jan. 21, citing industry sources. The tightening sanctions prompted a sharp drop in Russian seaborne crude exports over the past week, according to Bloombirg. Since the Jan. 10 measures, dozens of tankers around the world have dropped anchor and suspended operations. According to S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, sanctioned Surgutneftegaz and Gazprom Neft accounted for about 20% of Russian oil exports to India, while tankers included in the sanctions &quot;blacklists&quot; transported 450 thousand barrels per day to the country, or a quarter of all deliveries. The Indian authorities have decided that sanctioned tankers will not be able to enter the country&apos;s ports after March 12, the date when the period set by the US Treasury Department for completing all transactions with blacklisted individuals ends. Until that date, India is ready to accept tankers loaded before the sanctions were imposed, a high-ranking official in New Delhi told Bloomberg.	https://kyivindependent.com/indian-banks-block-russian-oil-payments-after-new-us-sanctions/	2025-01-21T20:07:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1249927966.jpg
Trump claims he urged China's Xi to help end Russia's war in Ukraine	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Jan. 21 that he pressed Chinese President Xi Jinping to help put an end to Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump claimed he brought the matter up with Xi during a call. &quot;He&apos;s not done very much on that,&quot; Trump said. &quot;He&apos;s got a lot of ... power, like we have a lot of power. I said, &apos;You ought to get it settled.&apos; We did discuss it.&quot; Xi and Trump spoke by phone on Jan. 17, though Trump did not mention Ukraine in his comments directly afterwards. Trump&apos;s latest remarks come a day after his presidential inauguration. On the same day, Xi held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin in which he praised the deepening ties between Moscow and Beijing. &#xA0; While Trump in the past has spoken admiringly of both Xi and Putin, he told reporters that the U.S. would &quot;likely&quot; impose new sanctions on Russia if Putin refuses to make deal. The previous day, he said Putin was &quot;destroying Russia&quot; by not making a deal to end the war. Trump campaigned on the promise that he could end Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine within 24 hours of his election. Since his November victory, the timeline for a peace agreement has changed significantly, with Trump acknowledging in December that the situation is &quot;a tough one.&quot; Both the U.S. and Ukraine have previously urged China to exert pressure on Russia to de-escalate the war, including by withdrawing North Korean troops and military aid. Although China has positioned itself as a possible mediator between Russia and Ukraine in future negotiations, Beijing remains Moscow&apos;s key economic ally and leading source of dual-use goods that feed the Kremlin&apos;s war machine. China nonetheless denies accusations of supporting Russia&apos;s invasion. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-claims-he-urged-chinas-xi-to-help-end-russias-war-in-ukraine/	2025-01-21T19:00:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1163306252.jpg
Ukraine's energy grid may suffer from Trump aid freeze, Politico reports	U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s foreign aid pause may hinder Ukraine&apos;s ability to rebuild energy facilities damaged by Russian attacks, Politico reported on Jan. 21, citing Ukrainian officials. Trump issued an executive order imposing a 90-day freeze on all U.S. foreign development assistance on Jan. 20, his first day in office. The order appears to target programs under the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which provides humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. The aid freeze could affect Ukraine&apos;s ability to rebuild damaged energy infrastructure, conduct demining operations, and fund civil society programs, according to Maksym Samoiliuk, an economist at the Kyiv-based Center for Economic Strategy. &quot;The question is how exactly this decree will be implemented and whether the previous Biden administration was preparing for such a development and did not transfer funds in advance, for example,&quot; Samoliuk told Politico. U.S. Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat, also slammed Trump for issuing the order in winter amid Ukraine&apos;s ongoing energy crisis. &quot;Does that mean that we will abandon Ukraine in the middle of winter? Because USAID has been providing critical funding for the rebuilding of their electric grid every time Russia attacks it,&quot; Coons said. Russia continues to target Ukrainian energy infrastructure, ramping up attacks in the winter months. In December 2024, Russia carried out one of its largest assaults on Ukraine&apos;s electric grid, launching 90 missiles and 200 drones against the country&apos;s thermal power plants. While a pause on USAID funding could put some projects in Ukraine at risk, other types of aid have already been secured under former U.S. President Joe Biden, officials said. Trump&apos;s freeze does not apply to weapons or the $20 million in loans backed by frozen Russian asset revenues that the U.S. allocated for Ukraine last fall. &quot;In terms of budget funding, we&apos;re secured,&quot; Roksolana Pidlasa, chair of the Verkhovna Rada&apos;s budget committee, told Politico. &quot;Biden&apos;s administration transferred all the funds under the ERA initiative to the World Bank.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-energy-grid-may-suffer-from-trump-aid-freeze-politico-reports/	2025-01-21T17:41:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194978801.jpg
US 'likely' to sanction Russia if Moscow refuses peace negotiations, Trump says	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Jan. 21 that he would likely impose additional sanctions against Russia if Russian President Vladimir Putin fails to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine. &quot;Sounds likely,&quot; Trump said responding to a question from a reporter on whether he would impose additional sanctions on Russia if Putin fails to come to the negotiating table. Trump comments on the issue come as Trump administration officials are reportedly developing a comprehensive sanctions strategy aimed at facilitating a diplomatic resolution to the Russia-Ukraine war, according to Bloomberg. The Trump team is reportedly weighing two primary approaches. The first set of policy recommendations suggests that, if a resolution to the war appears possible, the administration should focus on good-faith measures to benefit sanctioned Russian oil producers that could help seal a peace deal. The second option would involve expanding sanctions to exert maximum pressure, increasing leverage over Moscow. Trump has repeatedly vowed to quickly negotiate the end of the war. Although a detailed plan has not yet been proposed, the deal that would likely require the presence of European peacekeepers. Trump, who has previously stressed he needs to consult with Russian President Vladimir Putin first, is working to actively arrange a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Biden administration and the U.K. recently imposed their most extensive sanctions yet on Russia&apos;s oil sector, targeting nearly 200 vessels in the &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; key oil companies, and related entities. These measures, announced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on Jan. 10, have already impacted the global oil market, pushing Brent crude prices up by nearly $5 per barrel. The G7 nations are also considering tightening the existing $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 19.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-likely-to-sanction-russia-if-moscow-refuses-peace-negotiations/	2025-01-21T16:05:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2177668198.jpg
Supervisory board extend arms procurement head's contract, initiates audit following proposed merger	The supervisory board of Ukraine&#x2019;s Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) extended a 1-year contract to Maryna Bezrukova, the current director of the DPA, the agency announced on Jan. 21. The contract extensions comes after Defense Minister Rustem Umerov walked back on plans to merge the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) and the State Logistics Operator (DOT) into one agency, following a NATO statement said that the two agencies should be kept separate and two separate supervisory boards established &quot;to perform their tasks and supporting their independence and anti-corruption policies.&quot; In addition to the contract extension, the board said in a statement that it had initiated a &quot;comprehensive audit of the Agency&apos;s activities,&quot; which will involved NATO&apos;s International Board of Auditors (IBAN). Bezrukova, whose contract was extended by a unanimous vote, is a former employee of Ukraine&#x2019;s energy company Ukrenergo, before being appointed to head the DPA. Separate boards were set up for Ukraine&#x2019;s lethal and non-lethal procurement agencies, complying with NATO standards, in the fall of 2024. The defense procurement sector was reshaped in December 2023, aiming to meet NATO standards. The DPA, first established in August 2022, was to focus solely on lethal aid. Meanwhile, the DOT was formed to purchase non-lethal aid such as food and clothing.	https://kyivindependent.com/supervisory-board-extend-arms-procurement-heads-contract-initiates-audit-following-proposed-merger/	2025-01-21T14:59:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/DSC01371.jpg
Albania signs 10-year security cooperation agreement with Ukraine	Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama and President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a 10-year security cooperation agreement on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 21. The wide-ranging agreement includes cooperation between the two countries in areas including defense, intelligence sharing, cyber security, nuclear safety, as well as mutual support for each others accession into the European Union, among other topics. &quot;Albania reaffirms its unwavering support for Ukraine&apos;s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders as of 1991,&quot; the agreement reads, adding that the document does not &quot;substitute for Ukraine&#x2019;s future membership in NATO.&quot; &quot;Albania has been providing military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale invasion and it will continue its support throughout the ten-year term of the agreement,&quot; Zelensky wrote on X. &quot;I am grateful to Albania for supporting our European integration path, strengthening our positions on the battlefield, and bringing us closer to a just and lasting peace for Ukraine.&quot; As Albania&apos;s military support for Ukraine continues, the agreement notes that Albania will &quot;continue to support Ukraine in the same way as in 2022-2024.&quot; The agreement also committed Albania into its participation in the fighter jet coalition, an allied initiative helping Ukraine acquire U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets and the necessary training. &quot;Albania will make its contribution to the fighter jet coalition by providing English language training for Ukrainian pilots and technicians,&quot; the agreement reads. Albania, a member of NATO, previously signed a joint cooperation agreement with Ukraine in February 2024. A few days prior on Jan. 19, Tirana opened its first embassy in Ukraine, establishing the country&apos;s first permanent diplomatic mission in Kyiv since the two countries entered into diplomatic relations in 1993.	https://kyivindependent.com/albania-signs-10-year-security-cooperation-agreement-with-ukraine/	2025-01-21T13:46:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/174cb142ba68ea04f71ed9529473c5e2_1709114474_extra_large.jpeg
Syria reportedly cancels deal with Russian construction firm following Assad's downfall	Syria&apos;s port of Tartus has terminated a 49-year investment agreement with Russian construction company Stroytransgaz, the independent Russian outlet Important Stories reported on Jan. 21, citing Riad Joudeh, head of customs in the city of Tartus. The decision follows the collapse of Russian-backed dictator Bashar al-Assad&apos;s regime on Dec. 8, after a swift offensive by opposition forces that captured Damascus, significantly undermining Russia&#x2019;s influence in Syria. The contract, signed in 2019, had committed Moscow to invest at least $500 million in modernizing the port. With the agreement now void, all revenues from the port&apos;s operations will go directly to the Syrian state, and its management will revert to local authorities. The new Syrian government has also blocked a Russian vessel from evacuating military equipment from the Tartus naval base, The Moscow Times reported on Jan. 9. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha discussed Russia&#x2019;s military presence in Syria during a Dec. 30 diplomatic visit to Damascus. Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said the same day that Kyiv and the new Syrian leadership share similar views on the issue, though specific details were not revealed.	https://kyivindependent.com/syria-reportedly-cancels-russian-investment-agreement-for-tartus-port-modernization/	2025-01-21T13:30:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2189980735.jpg
Ukraine-Russia peace deal would require at least 200,000 peacekeepers, Zelensky says	At least 200,000 European soldiers would be required to serve as peacekeepers on Ukraine&apos;s eastern front for a peace deal to be enforced, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 21. &quot;From all the Europeans? 200,000, it&#x2019;s a minimum. It&#x2019;s a minimum, otherwise it&#x2019;s nothing,&quot; Zelensky said during the panel. Zelensky&apos;s comments comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to quickly negotiate the end of the war. Although a detailed plan has not yet been proposed, the deal that would likely require the presence of European peacekeepers. Trump, who has previously stressed he needs to consult with Russian President Vladimir Putin first, is working to actively arrange a meeting with Ukraine, Zelensky said. During his remarks in Davos, Zelensky highlighted the imbalance in military capabilities, noting that Russia can deploy 1.5 million troops compared to Ukraine&apos;s 800,000 and France&apos;s 200,000. Zelensky ruled out Moscow&apos;s demand of reducing the size of the country&apos;s military in order to achieve a peace deal. The new U.S. president has revealed few details of his plans to end the war. His team signaled that the new administration would seek to preserve Ukraine&apos;s independence, though U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that both Kyiv and Moscow would have to make concessions to achieve a peace deal. Earlier in his remarks, Zelensky called on European nations to unite against Russian aggression, warning that battles involving North Korean soldiers are now geographically closer to Davos than to Pyongyang. &quot;Europe must establish itself as a strong global player,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that, while the United States remains an indispensable ally, Washington doubts Europe&apos;s ability to contribute meaningfully to global security. Zelensky has been in contact with a number of European leaders about the prospects of a peacekeeping mission &#x2014; an initiative that French President Emmanuel Macron has spearheaded. During a visit to Kyiv on Jan. 16, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that Britain will play its &quot;full part&quot; in supporting efforts to maintain an enduring peace in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-russia-peace-deal-would-require-at-least-200-000-peacekeepers-zelensky-says/	2025-01-21T13:06:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/f798ed2187a644a475ac0e3db9836c62_1692023126_extra_large.jpeg
Following Trump's inauguration, Russian pundits and politicians show some enthusiasm, some reserve	Russian President Vladimir Putin was quick to congratulate his U.S. counterpart, Donald Trump, issuing a short statement before the start of the inauguration ceremony in Washington. &quot;We were always ready to support relations of equal cooperation with any American administration,&quot; Putin told members of the country&apos;s National Security Council in a call on Jan. 20, claiming that Russia was &quot;open to dialogue on the &apos;Ukrainian conflict,&apos;&quot; a name used by the Kremlin for the war it wages against Ukraine. Later reporting suggested that Trump&apos;s team was already preparing a call with Putin, which could take place &quot;very quickly.&quot; On the following day, however, Putin&apos;s press secretary Dmitry Peskov denied any preparations. Russian parliamentarians, whose role is diminished to approving Putin&apos;s agenda and attacking his enemies, on Jan. 20 showed signs of reserve. Trump simply &quot;doesn&apos;t have a final stance&quot; on the war, according to Konstantin Kosachev, the deputy speaker of the Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian parliament, which has little to no real power in the country. This would explain why Trump didn&apos;t mention Russia&apos;s war a single time in his inauguration speech, Kosachev argued. This also means that improving Russian-American relations &quot;will be difficult,&quot; said Leonid Slutsky, the head of the Russian Parliamentary Committee of Foreign Affairs. Slutsky, the leader of one of the country&apos;s pro-Putin political parties, blamed former U.S. President Joe Biden for the tarnished relations between the two countries. The U.S. will remain &quot;hostile to Russia,&quot; said Russian Senator Andrey Klishas. Kremlin pundits, meanwhile, didn&apos;t turn their tune, blaming Ukraine for, well, everything. Olga Skabeeva, the host of a popular evening talk show, connected with Ekaterina Moore, a Washington correspondent for Russian state-controlled media, who demonstrated her invitation to Trump&apos;s inauguration on air. &quot;They invited you, but neither (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky nor (French President Emmanuel) Macron,&quot; Skabeeva commented, passing next to the fact that Putin was not invited either. Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council Meeting in Igora ski resort, north of Saint Petersburg, Russia, on Dec. 26, 2024. (Contributor / Getty Images)Zelensky, in addition, would have been desperate to receive an invitation, according to Skabeeva, who quoted Donald Trump Jr, the son of the current U.S. president, who has been actively attacking Kyiv online. Fellow pundit Vladimir Solovyev, on his end, reposted a publication on Telegram according to which &quot;Trump mentioned democracy 637 times and Ukraine not a single time&quot; in his inauguration speech. In another post, Solovyev attacked Biden, claiming that the ex-president needed to pardon former U.S. Chief Medical Advisor Anthony Fauci because U.S. Covid vaccines had &quot;side effects, which were ordered to stay silent on.&quot; Biden&apos;s last-minute presidential pardons were also a topic for Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova, who claimed that these decrees were &quot;self-incriminating.&quot; Zakharova also welcomed Trump&apos;s executive order on the recognition of only two genders, insinuating that under Biden, the U.S. government had been actively promoting non-binary identities in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, &quot;many people&apos;s lives were broken,&quot; Zakharova claimed. Back on Skabeeva&apos;s evening show, Russian parliamentarian and political scientist Andrey Isayev saw this year&apos;s Inauguration Day as a &quot;competition between Trumpists and globalists.&quot; Russian propaganda&apos;s talking points have long been similar to the ones expressed by right and far-right pundits in the U.S. The first group, according to Isayev, is &quot;obviously prevailing.&quot; However, this does not change much for Russia as &quot;both parties fight for Western domination.&quot; With regards to Ukraine, Trump&apos;s presidency would not change much, as the new president &quot;will not leave Europe,&quot; the Russian parliamentarian argued.

(Bill Clark / Pool / Getty Images)Similar arguments came up on the popular pro-war Telegram channel Rybar, which called upon its readers to &quot;judge (U.S. foreign policy) based on concrete decrees and actions in the next three months,&quot; not based on Trump&apos;s inauguration speech. Meanwhile, Kremlin-aligned economists showed hope that sanctions against Russia could be lifted, even if Trump&apos;s policies on Russia could be &quot;tough,&quot; according to industry expert Leonid Khazanov, who was quoted by pro-Kremlin outlet Lenta. For 15 years, Lenta was one of the leading Russian independent news outlets. In 2014, months after Russia launched its war against Ukraine, the news outlet was taken over by the Russian government. Fired journalists left for Riga, Latvia, and founded the Meduza news outlet. Despite Russia&apos;s cautious optimism and lack of outright criticism of the incoming administration, Trump didn&apos;t return the favor. On Jan. 20, Trump said that Putin was &quot;destroying Russia&quot; by failing to reach a peace deal with Ukraine. &quot;He should make a deal. I think he&apos;s destroying Russia by not making a deal,&quot; Trump said following his inauguration.	https://kyivindependent.com/donald-trump-was-long-seen-as-russian-candidate-of-choice-in-moscow-however-reactions-following-inauguration-are-mixed/	2025-01-21T12:44:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194304549.jpg
Israel proposes sending seized Russian weapons in Lebanon to Ukraine, deputy FM says	Israel&apos;s Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel proposed transferring Russian weapons seized by Israel in Lebanon to Ukraine during a Jan. 21 meeting with Ukrainian Ambassador Yevhen Korniychuk, Ukraine&apos;s embassy reported. The initiative follows Israel&apos;s September 2024 ground invasion of southern Lebanon as part of its campaign against the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah. The discussion also addressed military collaboration between Iran and Russia, which poses security risks to both nations. Moscow and Tehran recently formalized their partnership, signing a strategic agreement on Jan. 17. The Ukrainian ambassador thanked Haskel for the proposal, emphasizing the significance of recognizing shared threats faced by Ukraine and Israel. Ukraine&apos;s embassy expressed hope for a positive resolution to the initiative, which it called an important step in strengthening cooperation. Iran has supplied Russia with thousands of Shahed drones and short-range ballistic missiles, weapons frequently used in Russia&apos;s attacks on Ukrainian cities. Ukraine has supported Israel, expressing solidarity after the deadly attack by Hamas terrorists in October 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/israel-proposes-sending-seized-russian-weapons-in-lebanon-to-ukraine-deputy-fm-says/	2025-01-21T12:20:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/meeing-.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukrainian soldier reports harsh conditions, fatal accidents in regiment; unit launches investigation	Key developments on Jan. 21: The 78th Air Assault Regiment on Jan. 21 announced an internal investigation after a soldier of the unit pointed to excessive demands on his comrades that supposedly lead to exhaustion and fatal accidents when handling explosives. The soldier, Vitalii Holovnia, said on Facebook that an unmanned platoon commander of an attack drone unit forces soldiers to accomplish too many tasks, which leads to service members being exhausted, overstretched, and prone to mistakes. The news comes amid major scandals plaguing other units as Ukraine continues to struggle with mobilization and personnel shortages in the face of the Russian onslaught. &quot;Cases of accidents with explosives occurred because people had been in combat positions for a long time, and they were tired. It also happened that people performed some tasks during the day and some at night, so they worked around the clock. As a result, mistakes were made in the safety rules for handling explosives,&quot; Holovnia told the Kyiv Independent. According to Holovnia, casualties caused by the accidents were listed as battlefield losses. These included both deaths and injuries, he clarified for the Kyiv Independent. Approaching the third anniversary of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine still has no legal mechanism that would allow demobilization after a certain period of service. Holovnia noted that the aforementioned commander has favorites who receive the highest additional financial reward, Hr 100,000 ($2,370), without going to combat positions, while others have to put their lives to do so. According to the soldier, the commander failed to ensure the units had communications and high-quality electronic warfare equipment to perform combat missions. As a result, the unit did not have a stable connection for emergencies for almost a month and a half in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Holovnia also claimed that the commander&apos;s decisions on staffing groups for combat missions led to internal conflicts. &quot;The leadership must be proper, appropriate. We must fight with our minds and equipment, not with (people as) meat.&quot; Following the complaint, the command of the 78th Regiment launched an internal investigation &quot;in compliance with all established procedures and aimed at objectively clarifying the circumstances.&quot; &quot;We urge the public not to make hasty conclusions based on unverified information,&quot; the statement read. &quot;The 78th Separate Air Assault Regiment remains a powerful military unit that performs combat missions to protect the territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine with honor and dignity.&quot; Ukrainian forces struck the Liskinskaya oil depot in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast, the Smolensk Aviation Plant, and a Russian command post in Donetsk Oblast overnight on Jan. 21, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said. The announcement comes as Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry reported intercepting 55 Ukrainian drones in a large-scale overnight strike, including 10 over Smolensk Oblast and six over Voronezh Oblast. The Liskinskaya oil depot was targeted again after being hit by a Ukrainian drone attack on Jan. 16. In the most recent strike, Ukrainian drones hit fuel and lubricant tanks, starting a fire at the Rosneft-run facility, the General Staff reported. An attack against the depot was confirmed by Voronezh Oblast Governor Alexander Gusev. The village of Liski, where the depot is located, lies around 140 kilometers (90 miles) north of Russia&apos;s border with Ukraine&apos;s Kharkiv Oblast. Another attack, carried out jointly by the Unmanned Systems Forces and the Special Operations Forces, hit the infrastructure of the Smolensk Aviation Plant, with explosions reported on the facility&apos;s territory, according to the General Staff. Smolensk lies less than 60 kilometers (around 35 miles) east of the Russia-Belarus border and some 270 kilometers (170 miles) north of Ukraine. The city&apos;s aviation plant is involved in the production and modernization of the Su-25 military aircraft, said Andrii Kovalenko, the counter-disinformation chief at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. The Ukrainian military also reported a successful hit against a command post of Russia&apos;s 29th Combined Arms Army in the occupied Volnovakha in Donetsk Oblast. &quot;The consequences of the strike are being clarified,&quot; the General Staff said without specifying the weaponry used. Ukrainian long-range drones regularly target Russian military and industrial facilities to undermine Moscow&apos;s ability to wage its full-scale war in Ukraine. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has detained the chief psychiatrist of the Armed Forces over suspected illicit enrichment in the amount of over $1 million, the agency reported on Jan. 21. According to charges, the official has acquired substantial undeclared assets since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, including a house in Kyiv Oblast, apartments in Kyiv and Odesa, luxury cars, and plots of land. The detainee also serves as the deputy head of the central medical commission, which determines the suitability of potential recruits for military service. Though the SBU did not name the suspect, Oleh Druz serves as the chief military psychiatrist. Military medical commissions have come under increasing scrutiny after suspected instances of corruption and other violations. Enlistment facilities across the country attracted authorities&apos; attention after journalists discovered in June 2023 that the family of the ex-head of the Odesa Oblast military enlistment office had acquired property worth $4.5 million since the start of the full-scale invasion. Ukraine&apos;s defense and health ministries pledged to reform the institution by November 2025 in order to tackle corruption and bureaucratic deficiencies. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Jan. 21 reiterated his commitment to ending Russia&apos;s war in 2025 &quot;not just quickly but fairly and reliably.&quot; Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Zelensky stressed the importance of ensuring Ukrainians can safely return home and rebuild their lives. &quot;We want to end the war this year - not just quickly but fairly and reliably for all of us, for Ukrainians,&quot; he said. &quot;So that they can return home, live in safety, and work.&quot; Zelensky underscored the need for strong European engagement, calling for allies to provide accurate information to U.S. President Donald Trump. &quot;We have very good relations with President Trump,&quot; he said, adding that &quot;voices conveying disinformation or pro-Russian positions could present risks.&quot; Zelensky also expressed concerns over possible Russian demands in peace negotiations, including calls for Ukraine to reduce its military and abandon NATO membership. Newly inaugurated on Jan. 20, U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to bring a swift resolution to the war but acknowledged that consultations with Russian President Vladimir Putin will be necessary. Trump criticized Putin&apos;s handling of the conflict on Jan. 20, claiming he is &quot;destroying Russia by not making a deal.&quot; The Davos forum, themed &quot;Collaboration for the Intelligent Age,&quot; brings together nearly 3,000 participants from over 130 countries, including 60 heads of state and government. Discussions include European defense strategy, NATO&apos;s future, and Ukraine&apos;s &quot;Peace through Strength&quot; approach, which advocates leveraging military and political power to secure a just peace. Key speakers include Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Poland&apos;s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, and European Parliament President Roberta Metsola. Zelensky&apos;s appearance follows his attendance at the January 2024 forum, which coincided with the fourth meeting on Ukraine&apos;s peace formula, paving the way for the global peace summit later that year. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will begin working on a ceasefire in Ukraine &quot;almost immediately,&quot; new U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told journalists on Jan. 20. Asked about a timeframe for ending the war, Rubio did not provide any specific deadline but said that negotiating a ceasefire would be a &quot;top priority to the president, so it&#x2019;ll (begin) almost immediately.&quot; &quot;In fact, some of that&#x2019;s already begun. You would hope that some of the groundwork has already been laid, but it&#x2019;ll be complex. I mean, it&#x2019;s a complex conflict and a bloody one, and it needs to end,&quot; he was quoted as saying by CNN. Rubio became the first high-level cabinet member of the new Trump administration to be confirmed by the Senate, making him the new U.S. secretary of state. &quot;I don&#x2019;t &#x2014; couldn&#x2019;t put a time frame on it, other than to say that anytime you bring an end to a conflict between two sides, neither of whom can achieve their maximum goals, each side is going to have to give up something,&quot; Rubio said, without specifying what these concessions might be. The chief U.S. diplomat acknowledged that Russia &quot;is the aggressor&quot; but stressed that the war &quot;needs to end.&quot; Previously, Rubio publicly praised the bravery of Ukrainian defenders but was among the 15 Republican lawmakers in the Senate who voted against the $61 billion aid package for Ukraine in early 2024. Its delay severely hampered Ukraine&apos;s fight against Russian forces. Although Trump vowed during his campaign in 2024 to put an end to the conflict in 24 hours if elected, aides revised the timeframe to the first 100 days after he took office. The Trump administration has not publicly disclosed details on any specific plans to broker a peace deal in Ukraine. An initial proposal leaked from Trump&apos;s team &#x2013; freezing the war along its current front lines, delaying Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2013; has already been rejected by Russia. U.S. President Donald Trump believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin is &quot;destroying Russia&quot; by failing to reach a peace deal on Ukraine, Trump told reporters at the White House on Jan. 20. &quot;He should make a deal. I think he&apos;s destroying Russia by not making a deal,&quot; Trump said following his inauguration. The new U.S. president was sworn in at the United States Capitol earlier on Jan. 20. Though his inauguration speech did not mention Ukraine, Trump has often claimed in the past that he would seek to bring a swift end to Russia&apos;s war. Talking to reporters, Trump again said he aims to conclude the conflict as soon as possible but noted he would have to talk to Putin first. The new U.S. president also said that his Russian counterpart &quot;can&apos;t be thrilled (with the war) since &quot;he&apos;s not doing so well.&quot; &quot;Most people thought that war would have been over in one week,&quot; Trump said, adding that Putin would be &quot;very well off to end the war.&quot; The U.S. president again boasted of warm relations with the Russian leader and voiced hopes for reaching a quick peace deal without presenting a specific timeline. Trump nevertheless noted that while Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky told him he seeks an agreement to end the war, the U.S. president is unsure whether Putin wants the same. Russia is estimated to have lost around 700,000-800,000 soldiers killed or wounded in almost three years of the full-scale war and faces economic headwinds in the year ahead. At the same time, Russian forces continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east while Kyiv struggles with manpower shortages. The U.S. president has revealed few details of his plans to end the war. His team signaled that the new administration would seek to preserve Ukraine&apos;s independence, though U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that both Kyiv and Moscow would have to make concessions to achieve a peace deal.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukrainian-soldier-reports-harsh-conditions-fatal-accidents-in-regiment-unit-launches-investigation/	2025-01-21T12:18:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/461284393_27329909956652636_6640114376022564971_n-1.jpg
Early voting begins in Belarusian presidential election	Early voting began on Jan. 21 in the Belarusian presidential election scheduled for Jan. 26, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported. The previous election, held in August 2020, was accompanied by large-scale voting fraud and the largest protests in Belarusian history. Most Western governments refused to recognize the 2020 election results and do not consider Alexander Lukashenko the country&apos;s legitimate leader. Lukashenko, who has been in power in Belarus since 1994, announced last year that he intended to run again in the Jan. 26 presidential election. Meanwhile, human rights activists call the early election procedure one of the mechanisms of vote rigging, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported. Up to 40% of voters usually take part in early voting, and the executive branch determines the number of people who are supposed to participate. Early voting plans are distributed among regions and enterprises, effectively forcing citizens to vote during this period, according to the media outlet. Elections in Belarus &quot;no longer fulfill their functions but are used by the authoritarian government to show a positive picture of general support and thus legalize the authoritarian government,&quot; Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported, citing human rights activists. Lukashenko claimed victory in the 2020 presidential election, which was widely denounced as rigged in his favor. It was followed by mass protests across the country, which were brutally suppressed by the authorities. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who leads Belarusian democratic forces in exile, said she had won 60% of the vote. The Belarusian dictator is also a close ally of Russia and has backed Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, providing Belarusian territory as a staging area for Russian invasion troops in 2022. Russia has also been using Belarus to launch missiles against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/early-voting-in-presidential-election-begins-in-belarus/	2025-01-21T12:14:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/4888dde3-a15f-e3f0-3ad7-8b6b4f2b02d9.jpeg
Germany's KNDS launches joint venture with Ukraine for military equipment repair, minister says	Germany&apos;s KNDS Deutschland, a manufacturer of Leopard 2 tanks, has officially opened a joint venture with a Ukrainian defense company, Ukraine&apos;s Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin reported on Jan. 21. &quot;This will significantly speed up repairs and strengthen our defense capabilities,&quot; he said. The collaboration aims to expedite equipment repairs for Ukrainian armed forces and boost the local economy with investments and job creation. Smetanin noted that Ukrainian specialists have already been trained in Germany, and initial systems have been installed at local facilities. The joint venture aligns with Kyiv&apos;s strategy to localize weapons production. In July 2024, German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall also confirmed plans to construct an ammunition factory in Ukraine. The ammunition factory project is expected to take several years to complete, marking a critical step in fortifying Ukraine&apos;s defense infrastructure and deepening its partnerships with Western defense companies amid the ongoing war with Russia. Over the past year, Ukraine has significantly increased its domestic weapon productions, accounting for about 33 - 34% of its annual weapons needs &#x2014; up from less than 10% before the full-scale invasion, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 15. Ukraine aims to spend a record $35 billion on weapons production in 2025, according to Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. The Ukrainian government intends to provide $17 billion, while the rest may be financed by allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/germanys-knds-launches-joint-venture-with-ukraine-for-military-equipment-repair/	2025-01-21T12:09:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1669833933.jpg
Zelensky says he wants to end war 'quickly but fairly and reliably' in 2025	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Jan. 21 reiterated his commitment to ending Russia&apos;s war in 2025 &quot;not just quickly but fairly and reliably.&quot; Speaking at at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Zelensky stressed the importance of ensuring Ukrainians can safely return home and rebuild their lives. &quot;We want to end the war this year - not just quickly but fairly and reliably for all of us, for Ukrainians,&quot; he said. &quot;So that they can return home, live in safety, and work.&quot; Zelensky underscored the need for strong European engagement, calling for allies to provide accurate information to U.S. President Donald Trump. &quot;We have very good relations with President Trump,&quot; he said, adding that &quot;voices conveying disinformation or pro-Russian positions could present risks.&quot; Zelensky also expressed concerns over possible Russian demands in peace negotiations, including calls for Ukraine to reduce its military and abandon NATO membership. Newly inaugurated on Jan. 20, U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to bring a swift resolution to the war but acknowledged that consultations with Russian President Vladimir Putin will be necessary. Trump criticized Putin&apos;s handling of the conflict on Jan. 20, claiming he is &quot;destroying Russia by not making a deal.&quot; The Davos forum, themed &quot;Collaboration for the Intelligent Age,&quot; brings together nearly 3,000 participants from over 130 countries, including 60 heads of state and government. Discussions include European defense strategy, NATO&apos;s future, and Ukraine&apos;s &quot;Peace through Strength&quot; approach, which advocates leveraging military and political power to secure a just peace. Key speakers include Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Poland&apos;s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, and European Parliament President Roberta Metsola. Zelensky&apos;s appearance follows his attendance at the January 2024 forum, which coincided with the fourth meeting on Ukraine&apos;s peace formula, paving the way for the global peace summit later that year.	https://kyivindependent.com/fairly-and-reliably-zelensky-reaffirms-commitment-to-end-war-in-2025/	2025-01-21T10:52:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156503093.jpg
‘A team of attention-seekers’ — Ukrainian soldiers and politicians react to Trump's Inauguration speech	Donald Trump was sworn in as U.S. president on Jan. 20, giving a speech containing a bombastic series of announcements and executive orders, not to mention the declaration of two national emergencies. Setting out the goals of his second term, with billionaires Elon Musk, Amazon&apos;s Jeff Bezos, and Meta&apos;s Mark Zuckerberg at his side, Trump took aim at everything from transgender rights and electric cars to drug cartels and a mountain in Alaska. Yet he kept his comments on U.S. foreign policy relatively vague and general, and never once mentioned what is likely to be one of his administration&apos;s biggest challenges &#x2014; ending Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home, while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad,&quot; Trump said without elaborating which events he was referring to. Trump declared open season on drilling for U.S. oil and gas, saying it was time to &quot;drill baby, drill!&quot; Although he didn&#x2019;t speak about it in the speech, flooding global markets with U.S. oil and gas could potentially push down prices and box out Russian oil, the country&apos;s main source of revenue that it uses to fund its war in Ukraine. A slightly stronger allusion to the war in Ukraine came when he criticized the administration of President Joe Biden for giving &quot;unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders&quot; at what he said was the expense of &quot;American borders, or, more importantly, its own people.&quot; Trump also said he would &quot;build the strongest military the world has ever seen,&quot; adding that success would be measured &quot;not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end and, perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.&quot; &quot;My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That&#x2019;s what I want to be, a peacemaker and a unifier,&quot; he added. Trump went on to highlight the ceasefire in Gaza which came into force the day before he was sworn in, but made no mention of any ceasefire or peace negotiations in relation to the war in Ukraine. The new president campaigned on a message of ending the war in Ukraine within 24 hours. After his election, he has since admitted that bringing an end to the fighting in Ukraine will take much longer. In terms of apparent concrete foreign policy actions his administration will undertake, Trump only made reference to the Panama Canal which he&apos;d previously pledged to reassert U.S. control over. &quot;We&#x2019;re taking it back,&quot; Trump said, accusing Panama of mismanaging the critical trade route and allowing China to take de facto control of it. We asked six Ukrainians what they made of Trump&apos;s omission of Ukraine and Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion from his inauguration speech. lawmaker from the European Solidarity faction Trump is the president of the United States, not of Ukraine. It&#x2019;s understandable why his speech was focused on the U.S. I don&#x2019;t see a huge problem in the fact that he didn&#x2019;t mention Ukraine. Aryev said that it&apos;s more important for him that Trump is planning to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to reach a peace deal and to increase oil production, which would reduce prices. It&apos;s a bigger blow for Russia than any statements.

(Julia Demaree Nikhinson / Pool / Getty Images)Yaroslav Yurchyshynlawmaker and head of the Ukrainian parliament&apos;s committee on freedom of speech We understand that Trump will prioritize internal affairs over external matters. Like any political consultant will tell you, talking about something traumatizing in an inauguration speech is not as effective as something motivating. We remember that Trump promised to finish the war in 24 hours, but even before the inauguration speech, he and his team understood, that for that goal, they needed much more time and that not hours, not days, not even months would be enough. And just after the inauguration speech, talking with the mass media, Trump said that he was ready to speak with Putin, but only after the beginning of the negotiation process. Yes, for Ukraine it would have been better to have been mentioned in the inauguration speech because it (would) show that Ukraine, the end of the Russia-Ukraine war, is among the priorities for Trump&apos;s new term. But we know that it&apos;s not. author and soldier in the Ukrainian army (Ending the war in) 24 hours is over, isn&#x2019;t it? Elon Musk kind of overwhelmed even Trump with the show (Musk made a controversial salute in a separate speech later in the day). I don&#x2019;t believe it matters what they say publicly, it&#x2019;s just a team of attention-seekers. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk appears to give a fascist salute while speaking during the inaugural parade at Capitol One Arena in Washington, DC, U.S. on Jan. 20, 2025. (Angela Weiss / AFP via Getty Images)Mykyta Poturayevlawmaker in President Volodymyr &#xA0;Zelensky&apos;s Servant of the People party President Trump expressed his &#x2014; so to speak &#x2014; philosophy about wars in general. I&apos;m referring to his view on the U.S.&apos;s mission and role in ongoing or potential wars and conflicts. This is enough for me personally (to understand his perspective). Now, seeing how (Trump will approach ongoing wars), it is necessary to work with him on a practical level. medic in the 166th brigade, Kupiansk I can&#x2019;t say if things will be better for us (now Trump has been inaugurated) because Trump is definitely not a sympathizer of Ukraine. He loves himself and will make decisions and measures to keep face. He promised to stop the war in 24 hours. Well, in 24 hours, of course, he will not stop it. But in any case, he will lead such a policy to keep face, his status, his machismo, so to speak. And in this spectrum of his vision, Ukraine is unlikely to be a priority. lawmaker and chair of the Ukrainian parliament&apos;s foreign affairs committee I&#x2019;m not disappointed because it was expected. In fact, he implied Ukraine when he was talking about the need to finish the wars in the world, and to prevent them from breaking out. Besides, Trump comes to power as, first and foremost most, the president who will focus on internal problems. The crux of the matter is whether he can come up with a realistic plan to stop Russian aggression. As of now, I don&#x2019;t see such a plan.

Zelensky says Ukraine working on arranging his meeting with Trump	Ukraine is actively working to arrange a meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump, Zelensky announced on Jan. 21 during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. &quot;The teams have been working on a meeting; they are currently in the process,&quot; Zelensky said, emphasizing Ukraine&apos;s commitment to ending the war with Russia. Zelensky noted Trump&apos;s public pledge to end the war in 2025. &quot;We are your partner. We know all the sore spots; we have lost our people,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to end the war this year. But not just quickly, but fairly and, above all, reliably for us.&quot; Trump, sworn in on Jan. 20, has previously claimed he could swiftly broker peace, though he stressed the need to consult with Russian President Vladimir Putin first. On Jan. 20, Trump expressed doubts about Moscow&apos;s willingness to negotiate. Zelensky also used his Davos address to urge Europe to strengthen its security framework and warn against reliance on the U.S. &quot;Europe must establish itself as a strong global player,&quot; he said, highlighting Russia&apos;s growing military capacity and alliances with Iran and North Korea. He underscored the imbalance in military production, with Russia outpacing Europe in ammunition and equipment output despite its smaller economy. The Davos forum, themed &quot;Collaboration for the Intelligent Age,&quot; convenes nearly 3,000 participants from 130 countries, including 60 heads of state and government. Discussions on Jan. 21 addressed European defense strategy, NATO&apos;s future, and Ukraine&apos;s &quot;Peace through Strength&quot; approach, which advocates using military and political leverage to pressure Russia into a just peace.

Topics also ranged from geo-economic challenges to the evolving role of artificial intelligence in global cooperation.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-working-to-secure-zelensky-trump-meeting-president-announces/	2025-01-21T09:39:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173922474.jpg
Trump team may meet Ukrainian delegation in early February, MP says	Members of U.S. President Donald Trump&apos;s team may meet a Ukrainian delegation during Ukraine Week in Washington in early February, David Arakhamia, head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s faction in parliament, said on Jan. 21. &quot;We are now working to ensure that the relevant meetings are held at the inter-parliamentary level and other levels,&quot; he said, as cited by Interfax Ukraine. Following his inauguration on Jan. 20, Trump reiterated his intent to pursue a peace deal in Ukraine but offered few specifics. Trump has instructed his aides to arrange a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin shortly after his inauguration, CNN reported on Jan. 19. The U.S. president told reporters on Jan. 20 that Putin is &quot;destroying Russia by not making a deal&quot; while acknowledging doubts about Moscow&apos;s willingness to negotiate. The Trump administration&apos;s Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, was expected to visit Ukraine before Trump&apos;s inauguration. However, he postponed his visit due to the U.S. Logan Act, which restricts unauthorized negotiations with foreign governments, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi explained on Jan. 10. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Jan. 15 that Kyiv and Moscow must make concessions to achieve peace, signaling potential challenges in crafting a mutually acceptable agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-admin-expected-to-meet-ukrainian-delegation-during-february-ukraine-week-arakhamia-says/	2025-01-21T08:44:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1263380211.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 10	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 10 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Jan. 13&#x2013;19, 2025. This newsletter was until recently titled &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief.&quot; The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Rada approves IMF-backed budget code reform for public investment The Ukrainian Parliament has passed draft law #12245, amending the budget code to streamline public investment management. The measure fulfills one of the International Monetary Fund benchmark. It establishes a centralized public investment fund to be overseen by the government&#x2019;s Strategic Investment Council, which currently mirrors the composition of the Cabinet of Ministers itself. This &#x201C;fund of funds&#x201D; will consolidate various expenditures, including the road fund, radioactive waste management, water resource development, decarbonization, and internal waterway projects. Ukrainian Parliament fails to advance reform to meet one of structural benchmarks The Committee on Law Enforcement reviewed four draft laws addressing the repeal of the &#x201C;Lozovyi amendments.&#x201D; However, it refrained from endorsing a specific proposal, recommending instead that parliament decide which draft to support. Despite the critical importance of these reforms, last week&#x2019;s parliamentary session failed to secure sufficient votes even to include the issue on the agenda.At the same time, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&#x2019;s Office (SAPO) supported the alternative draft law introduced by David Arakhamia, head of the Servant of the People faction. The bill proposes: Energoatom oversight board faces shortfall of international experts According to Forbes Ukraine, Energoatom&apos;s supervisory board is operating without a majority of its international experts, with contracts signed for only four members &#x2014; two from the Cabinet of Ministers and two international representatives. Journalists&#x2019; sources claim that Timothy Stone, a prominent figure in the U.K.&#x2019;s nuclear industry, declined to sign his contract, leaving a vacancy that the Cabinet must now fill through an open competition. According to Ukraine&apos;s Economy Ministry, on Jan. 17, the board convened for its first substantive meeting, electing former Lithuanian Energy Minister Jaroslav Neverovich as chairman. Neverovich is expected to use his decisive vote in the event of a tie. The supervisory board&apos;s first major decision is anticipated to be the announcement of a competitive selection process for the position of Energoatom CEO. Ukrainian Parliament extends martial law and mobilization The Verkhovna Rada has voted to extend martial law and military mobilization, marking the 14th time such measures have been approved. The extension will remain in effect from Feb. 8 to May 9, 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-10/	2025-01-21T07:42:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2155584026.jpg
Europe must become stronger in face of Russian hostility, Zelensky says	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 21, urging Europe to take charge of its own security amid escalating Russian threats. &quot;Europe must establish itself as a strong global player,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that, while the United States remains an indispensable ally, Washington doubts Europe&apos;s ability to contribute meaningfully to global security. Zelensky highlighted the imbalance in military capabilities, noting that Russia can deploy 1.5 million troops compared to Ukraine&apos;s 800,000 and France&apos;s 200,000. He called on European nations to unite against Russian aggression, warning that battles involving North Korean soldiers are now geographically closer to Davos than to Pyongyang. Despite having a smaller economy than Europe, Russia outpaces European nations in ammunition and military equipment production, a disparity Zelensky urged Europe to address collectively. Zelensky also emphasized the growing strategic ties between Russia, Iran, and North Korea, describing them as threats to Europe, the U.S., and global stability. &quot;These are their strategic priorities, and our priorities must meet this challenge &#x2014; in politics, defense, and economics. We can only counter such threats together,&quot; he said. Zelensky also said that Russia is evolving into a &quot;North Korea-like state,&quot; where human life holds no value, but nuclear weapons and hostility toward neighbors dominate its agenda. The Davos forum, themed &quot;Collaboration for the Intelligent Age,&quot; brings together nearly 3,000 representatives from over 130 countries, including 60 heads of state and government. Discussions on Jan. 21 include European defense strategy, NATO&apos;s future, and Ukraine&apos;s &quot;Peace through Strength&quot; approach, which advocates using military and political leverage to push Russia toward a just peace. High-profile speakers include Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Poland&apos;s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, European Parliament President Roberta Metsola, and Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics. Topics range from geo-economic uncertainty to the role of artificial intelligence in shaping global collaboration. Zelensky&apos;s appearance at the forum follows his attendance in January 2024, which coincided with the fourth meeting on Ukraine&apos;s peace formula, a precursor to the global peace summit in Switzerland.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-must-step-up-as-global-player-in-face-of-russian-hostility-zelensky-says/	2025-01-21T07:21:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161013738.jpg
Ukrainian soldier reports harsh conditions, fatal accidents in regiment; unit launches investigation	The 78th Air Assault Regiment on Jan. 21 announced an internal investigation after a soldier of the unit pointed to excessive demands on his comrades that supposedly lead to exhaustion and fatal accidents when handling explosives. The soldier, Vitalii Holovnia, said on his Facebook channel that an unmanned platoon commander of an attack drone unit forces soldiers to accomplish too many tasks, which leads to service members being exhausted, overstretched, and prone to mistakes. The news comes amid major scandals plaguing other units as Ukraine continues to struggle with mobilization and personnel shortages in the face of the Russian onslaught. &quot;Cases of accidents with explosives occurred because people had been in combat positions for a long time, and they were tired. It also happened that people performed some tasks during the day and some at night, so they worked around the clock. As a result, mistakes were made in the safety rules for handling explosives,&quot; Holovnia told the Kyiv Independent. According to Holovnia, casualties caused by the accidents were listed as battlefield losses. These included both deaths and injuries, he clarified for the Kyiv Independent. Approaching the third anniversary of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine still has no legal mechanism that would allow demobilization after a certain period of service. Holovnia noted that the aforementioned commander has favorites who receive the highest additional financial reward, Hr 100,000 ($2,370), without going to combat positions, while others have to put their lives to do so. According to the soldier, the commander failed to ensure the units had communications and high-quality electronic warfare equipment to perform combat missions. As a result, the unit did not have a stable connection for emergencies for almost a month and a half in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Holovnia also claimed that the commander&apos;s decisions on staffing groups for combat missions led to internal conflicts. &quot;The leadership must be proper, appropriate. We must fight with our minds and equipment, not with (people as) meat.&quot; Following the complaint, the command of the 78th Regiment launched an internal investigation &quot;in compliance with all established procedures and aimed at objectively clarifying the circumstances.&quot; &quot;We urge the public not to make hasty conclusions based on unverified information,&quot; the statement read. &quot;The 78th Separate Air Assault Regiment remains a powerful military unit that performs combat missions to protect the territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine with honor and dignity.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/78-air-assault-regiment-deadly-accidents/	2025-01-21T07:05:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/461284393_27329909956652636_6640114376022564971_n-1.jpg
EU has reduced Russian gas imports by 75%, von der Leyen says	The EU has reduced Russian gas imports by 75%, while only 3% of its oil is imported from Russia, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan. 21. The share of Russian coal in Europe&#x2019;s imports also went from 50% before Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion to zero by 2025, she said. &#x201C;Our gas imports from Russia went down by roughly 75% and now we import from Russia only 3% of our oil and no coal at all anymore,&quot; von der Leyen said. Europe began to wean itself off Russian energy commodities after Moscow&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine while Gazprom steadily reduced flows to the EU to pressure Ukraine&#x2019;s allies. &quot;This (Russian) energy appeared cheap, but it exposed us to blackmail. So when (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&apos;s tanks rolled into Ukraine, Putin cut us off his gas supplies, and in return, we substantially reduced our dependency on Russian fossil fuels in record time,&quot; she added. Kyiv&apos;s decision not to prolong a gas transit deal with Gazprom past December 2024 ended the supply of Russian pipeline gas to the EU. European countries continue buying Russian liquified natural gas, purchasing record amounts in 2024. Moscow and Kyiv signed an agreement in 2019 to transit 40 billion cubic meters of Russian gas annually through Ukraine to buyers in the EU. Gazprom raked in an estimated $5&#x2013;$6.5 billion annually from the deal. Thousands of participants, including political leaders and CEOs, have gathered for the annual World Economic Forum in Davos this week. President Volodymyr Zelensky is also attending the forum and is expected to meet top political and business officials.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-has-reduced-russian-gas-imports-by-75-von-der-leyen-says/	2025-01-21T06:22:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194490301--1-.jpg
Kyiv court arrests former host of pro-Russian channels Max Nazarov	Max Nazarov, a former host of shuttered pro-Russian news channels, was taken into custody on suspicions of spreading pro-Kremlin propaganda, Suspilne reported on Jan. 21, citing a court ruling. Nazarov has been sent to custody for 60 days pending trial, with an alternative of bail of Hr 12 million ($285,000). Nazarov, whose real name is Nazar Diorditsa, previously worked as a news presenter at the Nash and NewsOne television channels, both of which were considered among the leading pro-Russian news outlets in Ukraine. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced charges against Nazarov after searches of his home on Jan. 18, saying that &quot;large-scale evidence&quot; and &quot;conclusions from independent experts&quot; point to the news host&apos;s &quot;anti-Ukrainian activities.&quot; After the outbreak of the full-scale invasion, Nazarov regularly invited pro-Russian guests to his own YouTube channel show and used the discussions to justify Russian aggression and war crimes, the SBU said. Nazarov claimed on his Telegram channel that he bears no responsibility for the words of the guests he interviewed. Nash was owned by Yevheniy Muraiev, a wanted pro-Russian politician who fled the country after the full-scale invasion began and recently resurfaced in China. Ukraine sanctioned Nash in February 2022, leading to its closure. Shortly before the start of the full-scale Russian invasion, the U.K. Foreign Office warned that the Kremlin intends to install Muraiev as the head of the Russian puppet regime in Kyiv. NewsOne was also formerly owned by Muraviev but later became part of the unofficial media empire of pro-Russian politician and former lawmaker Viktor Medvedchuk, who lives in exile in Russia after being released from Ukrainian custody in a prisoner exchange in 2022. The news channel was banned in 2021 amid a broader crackdown on Medvedchuk&apos;s media operations, which were accused of promoting pro-Russian and anti-Ukrainian narratives.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-court-arrests-former-host-of-pro-russian-channels-max-nazarov/	2025-01-21T05:31:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/e4df9e96f6019058f5aed403f88d5cea.jpg
‘It needs to end’ — State Secretary Rubio’s position on Russia’s war against Ukraine	Republican Senator Marco Rubio was confirmed as the new U.S. secretary of state on Jan. 20, becoming the first member of President Donald Trump&apos;s new cabinet. In a rare display of bipartisan consensus, Rubio was confirmed just hours after Trump was sworn in for a second term in the White House. As secretary of state, Rubio will oversee the implementation of Trump&#x2019;s foreign policy, including that relating to Ukraine and Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion &#x2014; neither of which were directly referred to by the new president during his inauguration speech. Since Rubio was nominated for the position in early November, the signals coming from Trump and those around him about how the war in Ukraine might end have shifted dramatically, going from a swift end in &quot;in 24 hours,&quot; to a much more drawn out process that could take &quot;100 days.&quot; &quot;&#x200B;&#x200B;It&#x2019;s a complex conflict and a bloody one, and it needs to end,&quot; Rubio said after being confirmed. Regardless of the approach the Trump administration takes, Rubio will be at the forefront of any peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. Rubio, 53, is a former Republican senator from Florida. The son of Cuban immigrants, he would be the first Latino U.S. secretary of state. Rubio ran for the Republican nomination for U.S. president in 2016 but lost out to Trump after a heated, and at times bitter contest. Despite the rivalry at the time, Rubio went on to endorse Trump in 2016, albeit in not the most convincing of terms. &#x201C;I disagree with him on many things, but I disagree with his opponent on virtually everything. I wish we had better choices for president,&#x201D; he said. He endorsed Trump once again in 2024. Amid Rubio&#x2019;s confirmation, Trump revoked the former U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s last-minute decision to remove Cuba from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism in what became the first foreign policy decree by the new administration. &#x201C;Cuba belongs on the list,&#x201D; Rubio said a few days prior. The secretary of state job is Washington&#x2019;s top diplomatic position, and the person in this role is responsible for &quot;carrying out the president&apos;s foreign policy decisions and advising the president on issues of international concern,&quot; according to the National Museum of American Diplomacy. Rubio replaces Antony Blinken, who played a leading role in the U.S.-Ukraine relations throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion launched in early 2022. It was Blinken, along with his British counterpart David Lammy, who in September first received President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s detailed account of why Ukraine needs permission to strike targets deep inside Russia using Western missiles. Blinken has made numerous important announcements regarding Ukraine, including humanitarian assistance from the U.S., the provision of air defenses, and F-16 fighter jets. He has also made numerous trips to Kyiv during Russia&#x2019;s full-blown war against Ukraine. While on the job, Blinken was largely supportive of Ukraine and of providing Kyiv with what is needed to fight back against Russia&apos;s invasion. Rubio has publicly praised the bravery of Ukrainian defenders but was among the 15 Republican lawmakers in the Senate who voted against the $61 billion aid package for Ukraine in early 2024. Its delay severely hampered Ukraine&apos;s fight against Russian forces. In terms of a resolution to the war, Rubio&apos;s statements and actions have been very much geared towards negotiation and an end to the fighting rather than giving Ukraine what it needs to push Russian forces from its territory. &quot;I think the Ukrainians have been incredibly brave and strong in standing up to Russia,&quot; Rubio said on Nov. 6. &quot;But at the end of the day, what we are funding here is a stalemate war, and it needs to be brought to a conclusion, or that country is going to be set back 100 years.&quot; In September, he insisted he was &quot;not on Russia&#x2019;s side&quot; but that the &quot;reality of it is that the way the war in Ukraine is going to end is with a negotiated settlement.&quot; &quot;I would be comfortable with a deal that ends these hostilities and that I think is favorable to Ukraine, meaning that they have their own sovereignty, that they don&#x2019;t become a satellite state or a puppet state that is constantly held hostage by the Russians. I&#x2019;m not going to prejudge any agreement.&quot; Rubio has refrained from setting out any kind of timeline, and based on public statements, it&apos;s been left up to other members of the Trump administration to manage expectations. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly said he could end Russia&apos;s war within 24 hours if elected president, without ever elaborating on how he planned to achieve it. After winning the presidential election in November, these expectations were significantly dampened by Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s choice for special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, who said adjusted the timeline to within 100 days. Asked on Jan. 20 about a timeframe for ending the war, Rubio did not provide any specific deadline but said that negotiating a ceasefire would be a &quot;top priority to the president, so it&#x2019;ll (begin) almost immediately.&quot; &quot;In fact, some of that&#x2019;s already begun. You would hope that some of the groundwork has already been laid, but it&#x2019;ll be complex. I mean, it&#x2019;s a complex conflict and a bloody one, and it needs to end,&quot; he was quoted as saying by CNN. It&apos;s too early to say what sort of peace deal Trump&apos;s new administration will pursue and be able to forge. &quot;I don&#x2019;t &#x2014; couldn&#x2019;t put a time frame on it, other than to say that anytime you bring an end to a conflict between two sides, neither of whom can achieve their maximum goals, each side is going to have to give up something,&quot; Rubio said on Jan. 20, without specifying what these concessions might be. &quot;Russia is the aggressor in this conflict, but this war needs to end. And ultimately, that&#x2019;s the complexity of foreign policy.&quot; Some reports in recent months have provided clues as to the shape of any peace process. The latest report came last month when the Financial Times, citing its sources close to Trump&apos;s team, reported that he planned to freeze the war. According to the paper, the new Vice President J.D. Vance, in September outlined the idea of freezing the war by establishing autonomous regions on both sides of the demilitarized zone and leaving Ukraine outside the NATO military alliance. According to one of Trump&apos;s longtime advisors, the new plan would rethink the failed Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015, which were never implemented. The agreements contained a plan that would create temporarily autonomous zones in Russian-occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts which would later be fully reintegrated with the rest of Ukraine. Occupied Crimea was not mentioned in the Minsk agreements. In July, Politico reported that Trump was reportedly considering the possibility of making a deal with Russia to block the future NATO accession of certain countries, namely Ukraine and Georgia. One of the sources told Politico that Trump &quot;would be open to something foreclosing NATO expansion and not going back to the 1991 borders for Ukraine. Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have pushed back against the notion of any sort of ceasefire that would cement Russia&apos;s battlefield gains. &#x201C;When (Putin) gains strength, he might issue an ultimatum &#x2014; to recognize all occupied territories, to stay out of NATO, to forget about European integration,&#x201D; Zelensky said in June.&#x201C;And there will be many such conditions, depending on how strong (Putin) is at that moment. Therefore, a ceasefire is a trap,&#x201D; Zelensky added.	https://kyivindependent.com/it-needs-to-end-state-secretary-marco-rubios-position-on-russias-war-against-ukraine/	2025-01-21T04:57:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194442240.jpg
Chinese imports of Russian coal reportedly dropping over sanctions, price	China has been decreasing coal imports from Russia despite a steady growth in domestic demand, turning instead to Australian and Mongolian suppliers, The Moscow Times reported on Jan. 21, citing Chinese customs data. This development signals another blow to the Russian coal industry, which is already facing multibillion-dollar losses and mass bankruptcies. Russia&#x2019;s share in Chinese coal imports shrank despite the latter&#x2019;s demand growing by 14% in 2024 compared to the previous year, The Moscow Times reported. Russia&#x2019;s coal exports to China were said to have dropped by almost 7%, with Mongolian and Australian coal export volumes growing 18% and 60%, respectively, in 2024 compared to 2023. Warnings that Russia&#x2019;s coal industry was beginning to nosedive appeared in the second half of 2024, when AC TEK, a Russian state analytical center under the Energy Ministry, published a dire assessment. Western sanctions, insufficient transport infrastructure to the east, and Chinese tariffs levied on Russian coal are contributing to the industry&apos;s setback. Despite growing economic ties between Moscow and Beijing, the Western sanctions have presented an increasingly serious obstacle to Russian-Chinese trade relations.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-coal-imports-to-china/	2025-01-21T04:30:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1234072071.jpg
Russia’s Baltic Sea sabotage is no accident, it’s strategy	Intelligence officials in the U.S. and Europe have suggested that recent incidents damaging critical cables in the Baltic Sea were accidental, according to a Washington Post report. Western geostrategic self-deception has overly emphasized fears of escalation and cornering Russia. It would be na&#xEF;ve to assume that the repeated cutting of cables in the Baltic Sea, along with the recent leak, is purely accidental. Persistent incidents of &#x201C;poor seamanship&#x201D; in one of the world&#x2019;s most strategically significant maritime environments cannot be easily dismissed. Some within the Western foreign policy establishment may believe that this assessment signals de-escalation and patience toward Russia &#x2014; particularly with Donald Trump poised to take office. For them, the recently announced NATO operation in the Baltic is framed as mere maritime traffic control and accident prevention, requiring a more militarized presence for the sake of efficiency. The leak aligns with an unfortunate pattern of de-escalatory signaling to Russia. Yet others see the pattern of shadow fleet accidents as deliberate provocations with deeper geostrategic motivations, reflecting a tendency to escalate. A reasonable alternative to the &#x201C;accidents happen&#x201D; explanation is that the current and past incidents, which remain under investigation due to the inherent deniability, are the result of deliberate malice. Instead of downplaying these actions, a strong message of strategic resolve must be sent to Moscow. The cable-cutting occurred due to the self-evident, deliberate, and negligent actions of Russia&#x2019;s shadow fleet. While tactical leaks to the media may ease tensions, they only do so for the intended audience. For Russia, however, these leaks signal Western discord, encouraging both recklessness and further sabotage. There are clear geopolitical reasons for giving Russia the benefit of the doubt when it comes to these sabotage incidents. The investigation is challenging and may not produce conclusive evidence. Authorities may want the issue to disappear to avoid unwanted attention and scrutiny. Moreover, the situation drains already limited military resources, and some countries are less motivated to escalate tensions in the Baltic Sea, particularly with elections on the horizon. However, putting too much emphasis on these concerns risks provoking further Russian aggression and weakening deterrence. As the Finns say, &#x201C;The Russians will keep pushing with their bayonet until it hits something hard.&#x201D; (L-R) Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and Finnish President Alexander Stubb attend the Summit of Baltic Sea Allies at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki, Finland, on Jan. 14, 2025. (Roni Rekomaa / Bloomberg via Getty Images)Another Finnish saying, from their geopolitically pressured times, is that &#x201C;Moscow is not a district court.&#x201D; Russia respects the law only when it benefits them or when forced to do so, while Finland has always been committed to international law. Investigations are being conducted as thoroughly as possible, but conclusive attribution is difficult, as seen in numerous other suspected instances of Russian sabotage across Europe and North America. While the intent remains hard to establish, that shouldn&#x2019;t lead to granting Russia an implicit plea deal or allowing them to escape accountability. It&#x2019;s essential to see the forest for the trees. The repeated reckless actions by Russia should already be alarming enough to warrant countermeasures. The precautionary principle demands the establishment of deterrence. NATO has contributed to this by launching the Baltic Sentry operation. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte initiated the summit in Helsinki last week. Although not all NATO countries were invited, it was not just a Nordic-Baltic effort. More than half of Russia&#x2019;s energy exports pass through a critical corridor from St. Petersburg, through the narrow Gulf, and into the Danish Straits. If Russia&#x2019;s recklessness continues, this vital corridor, which allows for innocent passage, must be tightened. Legal measures to restrict this main artery include environmental, seaworthiness, and insurance inspections. The United Nations&apos; maritime convention, UNCLOS, also provides valuable alternatives. If Russia continues to abuse the line between war and peace, other legal frameworks, beyond UNCLOS, could become actionable. Russia views the Black, Baltic, and Arctic Seas as part of a unified geopolitical theater. The West should not engage in petty tactics like selective intelligence leaks. These are highly strategic waters, which Russia considers its imperial playground. Unfortunately, Chinese-registered ships have also been involved, as the Baltic Sea may serve as a rehearsal for the maritime blockade of Taiwan. Western reactions are carefully monitored. Ultimately, the Baltic Sea incidents are about testing Russia&#x2019;s defense thresholds. Leaks should not stem from minor disagreements or short-term considerations; when intelligence is leaked, it must convey a message of containment and deterrence.

Xi declares readiness to bring China-Russia ties to 'new height' in call with Putin	Chinese President Xi Jinping declared readiness to lead China-Russian relations to &quot;a new height&quot; together with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin&apos;s press service reported on Jan. 21 after a video call between the two leaders. China has deepened its ties with Russia since the start of the Kremlin&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine and has become Moscow&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry. Beijing has nevertheless denied accusations of supporting Russia&apos;s military efforts. In the call with Putin, Xi added that China is ready to stand with Russia to &quot;face external uncertainties based on maintaining the stability and stress resistance of China-Russia relations for the prosperity of the two countries, international justice, and equality.&quot; The Chinese president stressed that bilateral cooperation between Beijing and Moscow is gradually expanding and that joint trade is trending upward. Putin, in turn, noted a 7% increase in trade between the two countries, which amounts to more than $220 billion. The Russian president also called China Russia&apos;s leading trading partner. &quot;China is the largest consumer of Russian energy resources. We hold the first place in terms of oil exports to China. Five years ago, together with you, we launched the Power of Siberia gas pipeline, and today Russia has taken the first place in natural gas supplies to China,&quot; Putin said. Since February 2022, Putin has visited China twice &#x2014; first just days before launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and again in May 2024. Xi visited Russia in March 2023, where he was welcomed by his &quot;dear friend&quot; Putin. Beijing has also positioned itself as a mediator between Russia and Ukraine, sending envoy Li Hui on multiple rounds of shuttle diplomacy in Europe. China has criticized the U.S. and its allies for &quot;exacerbating&quot; the war by supplying arms to Ukraine, while NATO has named Beijing a &quot;decisive enabler&quot; of Russia&apos;s war.	https://kyivindependent.com/xi-declares-readiness-to-bring-china-russia-relations-to-new-height-together-with-putin/	2025-01-21T03:32:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1730511481--1-.jpg

Ukraine's SBU detains chief military psychiatrist over suspected illicit enrichment	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) detained the chief psychiatrist of the Armed Forces over suspected illicit enrichment in the amount of over $1 million, the agency reported on Jan. 21. According to charges, the official has acquired substantial undeclared assets since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, including a house in Kyiv Oblast, apartments in Kyiv and Odesa, luxury cars, and plots of land. The detainee also serves as the deputy head of the central medical commission that determines the suitability of potential recruits for military service. Though the SBU did not name the suspect, Oleh Druz serves as the chief military psychiatrist. Military medical commissions have come under increasing scrutiny after suspected instances of corruption and other violations. Enlistment facilities across the country attracted authorities&apos; attention after journalists discovered in June 2023 that the family of the ex-head of the Odesa Oblast military enlistment office had acquired property worth $4.5 million since the start of the full-scale invasion. Ukraine&apos;s defense and health ministries pledged to reform the institution by November 2025 in order to tackle corruption and bureaucratic deficiencies.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-sbu-detains-chief-military-psychiatrist-over-suspected-illicit-enrichment/	2025-01-21T03:08:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-21_10-00-03.jpg
Ukraine ceasefire is 'top priority' for Trump, US Secretary of State Rubio says	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will begin working on a ceasefire in Ukraine &quot;almost immediately,&quot; new U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told journalists on Jan. 20.

Although Trump vowed during his campaign in 2024 to put an end to the conflict in 24 hours if elected, aides revised the timeframe to the first 100 days after he took office. The Trump administration has not publicly disclosed details on any specific plans to broker a peace deal in Ukraine. An initial proposal leaked from Trump&apos;s team &#x2013; freezing the war along its current front lines, delaying Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2013; has already been rejected by Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-ceasefire-is-top-priority-for-trump-us-secretary-of-state-rubio-says/	2025-01-21T01:59:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194097519.jpg
Ukraine attacks Russian oil depot, aviation plant, command post overnight, military says	Ukrainian forces struck the Liskinskaya oil depot in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast, the Smolensk Aviation Plant, and a Russian command post in Donetsk Oblast overnight on Jan. 21, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said. The announcement comes as Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry reported intercepting 55 Ukrainian drones in a large-scale overnight strike, including 10 over Smolensk Oblast and six over Voronezh Oblast. The Liskinskaya oil depot was targeted again after being hit by a Ukrainian drone attack on Jan. 16. In the most recent strike, Ukrainian drones hit fuel and lubricant tanks, starting a fire at the Rosneft-run facility, the General Staff reported. An attack against the depot was confirmed by Voronezh Oblast Governor Alexander Gusev. The village of Liski, where the depot is located, lies around 140 kilometers (90 miles) north of Russia&apos;s border with Ukraine&apos;s Kharkiv Oblast. Another attack, carried out jointly by the Unmanned Systems Forces and the Special Operations Forces, hit the infrastructure of the Smolensk Aviation Plant, with explosions reported on the facility&apos;s territory, according to the General Staff. Smolensk lies less than 60 kilometers (around 35 miles) east of the Russia-Belarus border and some 270 kilometers (170 miles) north of Ukraine. The city&apos;s aviation plant is involved in the production and modernization of the Su-25 military aircraft, said Andrii Kovalenko, the counter-disinformation chief at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. The Ukrainian military also reported a successful hit against a command post of Russia&apos;s 29th Combined Arms Army in the occupied Volnovakha in Donetsk Oblast. &quot;The consequences of the strike are being clarified,&quot; the General Staff said without specifying the weaponry used. Ukrainian long-range drones regularly target Russian military and industrial facilities to undermine Moscow&apos;s ability to wage its full-scale war in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-russian-oil-depot-aviation-plant-military-confirms/	2025-01-21T01:35:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-21_06-56-23.jpg
Trump pauses US foreign development aid for 90 days, orders review	U.S. President Donald Trump paused U.S. foreign development assistance for 90 days and ordered reviews of aid programs to ensure they align with Washington&apos;s foreign policy, according to an executive order published by the White House on Jan. 20. Trump signed numerous decrees after being sworn in as the 47th president of the United States in a ceremony held in the United States Capitol on Jan. 20. Ukraine tops the list of U.S. development assistance recipients, receiving over $17 billion in economic aid in 2023 as it faces Russian aggression, official data shows. It remains unclear what programs will be affected or what the immediate impact of the order will be for Ukraine. As the federal budget is set by the U.S. Congress, it also remains unclear what funding could be cut by the order. In the document, Trump wrote that &quot;the United States foreign aid industry and bureaucracy are not aligned with American interests and in many cases antithetical to American values,&quot; without mentioning specific examples. &quot;All department and agency heads with responsibility for United States foreign development assistance programs shall immediately pause new obligations and disbursements of development assistance funds to foreign countries and implementing non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and contractors pending reviews of such programs for programmatic efficiency and consistency with United States foreign policy,&quot; the executive order reads. In addition to development aid, the U.S. has provided Kyiv with $66 billion in military assistance since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022. Trump has previously hinted at a possible reduction of military support for Ukraine and vowed to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the conflict.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-pauses-all-us-foreign-aid-for-90-days-pending-review/	2025-01-21T01:04:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158937171.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine injure 15 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine injured at least 15 civilians over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 21. Russia attacked Ukraine with four Iskander-M ballistic missiles overnight, the Air Force said. Moscow also launched 131 Shahed-type drones and decoy drones, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported on their Telegram channel. Ukrainian air defenses reportedly shot down 72 drones, while 59 other drones were lost in the airspace without causing further damage. Three people were injured in Russian attacks against Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Governor Serhii Lysak reported on his Telegram channel. These included two railway workers, Ukrainian Railways said. Three people were also injured in Russian strikes in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on his Telegram channel. The casualties were reported in Kostiantynivka, Lyman, and Druzhkivske. Two police officers were injured during a Russian attack on Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. In Kherson Oblast, six people were injured in strikes against Kherson and 38 other settlements, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. A 49-year-old man was wounded in a Russian attack on the Vasylivka district of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported on his Telegram channel.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-injure-15/	2025-01-21T00:30:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-21_06-36-32.jpg
Ukrainian drones reportedly attack Russian aviation plant in Smolensk	A Ukrainian drone attack targeted the Smolensk Aviation Plant in western Russia overnight on Jan. 21, starting a fire at the facility, the independent news channel Astra reported. Russian authorities confirmed a drone attack against Smolensk Oblast but made no mention of the plant. According to Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry, Russian air defenses intercepted 55 drones overnight, including 10 in Smolensk Oblast. &quot;Fallen drone debris caused fires on the ground and on the roofs. Windows of residential buildings were also damaged,&quot; Governor Vasily Anokhin said on his Telegram channel. The governor also warned against alleged &quot;fake information and videos&quot; appearing on social media regarding the drone attack. At least two high-rise residential buildings were damaged as a result of the attack, the Russian Telegram channel Shot claimed. No casualties were reported. The Ukrainian military did not comment on the claims, which could not be independently verified. Smolensk lies less than 60 kilometers (around 35 miles) east of the Russia-Belarus border and some 270 kilometers (170 miles) north of Ukraine. The city&apos;s aviation plant is involved in the production and modernization of the Su-25 military aircraft, said Andrii Kovalenko, the counter-disinformation chief at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. The same night, an oil depot in the village of Lisky in Voronezh Oblast caught fire due to fallen drone debris, Governor Alexander Gusev said. Ukrainian drones previously attacked the facility on Jan. 16.

US Senate confirms Marco Rubio as new secretary of state	The U.S. Senate confirmed Marco Rubio as the next secretary of state by a rare bipartisan consensus on Jan. 20, making him the first confirmed high-level member of the new Trump administration. Rubio will oversee the implementation of U.S. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s foreign policy, which is expected to entail a quick push to end Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. Trump has sent mixed signals about his approach to ending the conflict. Rubio recently said that both Russia and Ukraine would have to make concessions to achieve a peace deal, possibly indicating an agreement that would allow Moscow to hold on to at least some of the occupied territories. Previously, Rubio publicly praised the bravery of Ukrainian defenders but was among the 15 Republican lawmakers in the Senate who voted against the $61 billion aid package for Ukraine in early 2024. Its delay severely hampered Ukraine&apos;s fight against Russian forces. Rubio replaced Antony Blinken, who, in the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden, has played a leading role in U.S.-Ukraine relations throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion launched in early 2022. Officials close to Trump maintain that U.S. military aid to Ukraine will persist, focusing on empowering Kyiv to negotiate from a position of strength.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-senate-confirms-marco-rubio-as-next-us-secretary-of-state/	2025-01-20T23:24:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193483462.jpg
Putin is 'destroying Russia by not making a deal' to end war, Trump says	U.S. President Donald Trump believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin is &quot;destroying Russia&quot; by failing to reach a peace deal on Ukraine, Trump told reporters at the White House on Jan. 20. &quot;He should make a deal. I think he&apos;s destroying Russia by not making a deal,&quot; Trump said following his inauguration, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported. The new U.S. president was sworn in at the United States Capitol earlier on Jan. 20. Though his inauguration speech did not mention Ukraine, Trump has often claimed in the past that he would seek to bring a swift end to Russia&apos;s war. Talking to reporters, Trump again said he aims to conclude the conflict as soon as possible but noted he would have to talk to Putin first. The new U.S. president also said that his Russian counterpart &quot;can&apos;t be thrilled (with the war) since &quot;he&apos;s not doing so well.&quot; &quot;Most people thought that war would have been over in one week,&quot; Trump said, adding that Putin would be &quot;very well off to end the war.&quot; The U.S. president again boasted of warm relations with the Russian leader and voiced hopes for reaching a quick peace deal without presenting a specific timeline. Trump nevertheless noted that while Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky told him he seeks an agreement to end the war, the U.S. president is unsure whether Putin wants the same. Russia is estimated to have lost around 700,000-800,000 soldiers killed or wounded in almost three years of the full-scale war and faces economic headwinds in the year ahead. At the same time, Russian forces continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east while Kyiv struggles with manpower shortages. The U.S. president has revealed few details of his plans to end the war. His team signaled that the new administration would seek to preserve Ukraine&apos;s independence, though U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that both Kyiv and Moscow would have to make concessions to achieve a peace deal.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-is-destroying-russia-by-not-making-a-deal-trump-says/	2025-01-20T22:52:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194451398.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 822,030 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 822,030 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 21. This number includes 1,600 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,833 tanks, 20,477 armored fighting vehicles, 34,682 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,134 artillery systems, 1,262 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,050 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 22,898 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-822-030-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-20T22:20:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2003913401.jpg
German FM urges Scholz to act and support aid to Ukraine amid election campaign	German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has urged Chancellor Olaf Scholz to avoid politicizing aid to Ukraine during Germany&apos;s election campaign, n-tv reported on Jan. 20. Baerbock made the comments in Berlin, speaking alongside Lithuania&#x2019;s foreign minister. &#x201C;Times are too difficult now, Germany has too much responsibility for us all to indulge in pre-election rhetoric in the coming weeks,&#x201D; she said. Baerbock emphasized that Germany has pledged to support Ukraine and its Eastern European partners for as long as necessary. &quot;This is a crucial issue for trust in Europe, whether we are able to act in the interests of the security of all of us, our European security,&#x201D; she noted. Her remarks come amid reports of a growing rift in the intermin Social Democrat-Greens cabinet as Scholz is reluctant to greenlight an additional 3 billion euros ($3.1 billion) in security assistance for Kyiv. Despite Baerbock&apos;s and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius&apos; (SPD) support for the new assistance tranche, the chancellor said he would sign off on it only if it is paid with additional borrowing, an unpopular step among other parties. Berlin stands as Ukraine&apos;s second largest military donor, a role of growing importance as Ukraine faces a heavy Russian onslaught in the east of the country, and the future of U.S. support appears uncertain under the incoming Trump administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-fm-urges-scholz-to-act-and-support-aid-to-ukraine-amid-election-campaign/	2025-01-20T22:04:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/baerbock.jpeg
Erdogan intends to discuss ending Russia’s war in Ukraine with Trump	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that there was an urgent need for a &#x201C;just and lasting peace&#x201D; in Ukraine, at a press conference on Jan. 20. He made this statement after meeting with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico. &#x201C;A just and lasting peace must be achieved in Ukraine as soon as possible&#x2026;before the consequences of the war in our neighboring geography deepen even further,&#x201D; Erdogan said. He reaffirmed Turkey&apos;s ongoing commitment to this goal and noted his plans to discuss the matter with newly inaugurated U.S. President Donald Trump. Slovak Prime Minister Fico acknowledged his country&#x2019;s limited influence in the outcome of the war, and noted that if the new U.S. administration can quickly end the war, it should be fully supported. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s take off our rose-colored glasses,&#x201D; Fico said, saying that there was a low likelihood of Russia withdrawing from occupied territories in Ukraine. The two leaders also signed agreements elevating Turkish-Slovak relations to a strategic partnership and expanding cooperation in military, cultural, and defense industries. While Turkey is a NATO member, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has aimed to maintain positive relations with both Russia and Ukraine. Turkey has also facilitated the flow of Russian oil to the European Union since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, enabling the Kremlin to circumvent the bloc&#x2019;s sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/erdogan-intends-to-discuss-ending-russias-war-in-ukraine-with-trump/	2025-01-20T19:48:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1410425074.jpg
Macron warns of prolonged Ukraine war, urges stronger European defense strategy	French President Emmanuel Macron cautioned on Jan. 20 that Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine is far from over, as Donald Trump, who vowed to quickly end the conflict, assumed office again. &quot;Let us not delude ourselves,&quot; Macron said earlier during his New Year&#x2019;s address to the French armed forces, according to AFP. &quot;This conflict will not end tomorrow or the day after,&quot; he added, with the third anniversary of Russia&#x2019;s invasion approaching next month. Trump has previously pledged to end the war &quot;in 24 hours&quot; without detailing his plan and later extended the timeline to several months. Speaking in Cesson-S&#xE9;vign&#xE9; in northwestern France, Macron emphasized the importance of strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s position. &quot;It is essential to provide Ukraine with the means to endure and to negotiate from a position of strength in the future,&quot; he said. He also stressed the need to ensure Ukraine&#x2019;s security and prevent a resurgence of war on its territory. Macron renewed his call for Europe to take greater responsibility for its defense, a point he has often raised. &quot;There can be no peace and security in Europe without Europeans,&quot; he said, referencing the war in Ukraine and Europe&#x2019;s role in future negotiations. Trump&#x2019;s questioning of NATO commitments and his remarks about reducing support for Ukraine have sparked fresh urgency among European nations to reassess their defense capabilities. In 2023, France approved a record 413-billion-euro ($450 billion) military budget for 2024-2030, marking its most significant defense spending boost in decades. Macron also directed the government and armed forces to submit plans by May to mobilize more young volunteers to support the military. This appears to acknowledge the end of his long-championed universal national service project. &quot;In order to build up this reserve, the Defense and Citizenship Day will be revamped,&quot; he added, without elaborating. Currently, France requires all citizens to participate in a one-day &quot;Defense and Citizenship&quot; program at age 18, which introduces the country&#x2019;s military forces and includes a French language test. Macron called for better efforts to identify willing volunteers. During his 2017 presidential campaign, Macron proposed a month-long mandatory national service, aiming to expose young people to military life. The army&#x2019;s lukewarm response led to the government pivoting toward a civic service initiative instead.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-warns-of-prolonged-ukraine-war-urges-stronger-european-defense-strategy/	2025-01-20T15:50:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1522719294.jpg
EU plans to eliminate Russian fossil fuels, aims to end gas imports	The European Commission is developing a strategy to eliminate Russian fossil fuels from the European Union&apos;s energy market. However, gas deliveries from Russia to Europe persist despite the EU&apos;s efforts, and Brussels is determined to halt this, Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, the EU&#x2019;s spokesperson for energy and housing, said. Speaking at a press briefing in Brussels on Jan. 20, Itkonen noted that work on a comprehensive roadmap to fully phase out Russian fossil fuels is ongoing. &quot;This initiative was announced as a priority for the Energy Commission to deliver within its first 100 days, so we still have a little time before the deadline,&quot; she said, according to Interfax news agency. Itkonen highlighted that the EU has already made substantial progress in reducing its dependence on Russian energy. &quot;We have significantly reduced imports of Russian gas, eliminated all coal imports from Russia, and cut most oil imports,&quot; she explained. Despite these achievements, Russian gas continues to be present on the EU market, which remains a concern. &quot;This is an issue we aim to address in the roadmap that will be unveiled in the coming weeks,&quot; Itkonen added.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-plans-to-eliminate-russian-fossil-fuels-aims-to-end-gas-imports/	2025-01-20T13:39:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1013825882.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ammunition used by Russians halved following Ukrainian strikes, Syrskyi says	Key developments on Jan. 20: Russia&apos;s ammunition use has been cut nearly in half amid the long-term impacts of Ukrainian strikes on Russian military targets, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said in an interview with the Ukrainian news outlet TSN on Jan. 19. Ukraine has intensified strikes deep into Russian territory in an attempt to weaken Russia&apos;s ability to wage war in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;For several months now, the artillery ammunition expenditure rates in the Russian army have practically halved. If previously the figure reached up to 40,000 rounds per day, it is now significantly lower,&quot; Syrskyi said when asked what the impact of Ukrainian strikes has been on Russia&apos;s military supply-chain. Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory target &quot;industrial enterprises that produce ammunition, missile parts, or dual-use products are targeted for destruction,&quot; Syrskyi said, adding that oil refineries serve as regularly military targets. Ukraine has regularly targeted Russian ammunition depots in an attempt to stall Russia&apos;s operations on the front line. Despite being regularly outgunned by Russian forces since the start of the full-scale war, Ukraine has managed to progress in arms production, with the country producing about 33-34% of its annual weapons needs &#x2014; up from less than 10% before the full-scale invasion, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 15. Europe and the U.S. supply more than 60% of Ukraine&#x2019;s weaponry, with each accounting for about 30%. Earlier in his interview, Syrskyi said that Ukraine is working on developing its own air defense systems, including ones that can repel the the Oreshnik missile. &quot;This encourages us to create our own air defense system, which would be not just an air defense system, but also an anti-missile system,&quot; Syrskyi said. &quot;The work is underway, it is being actively pursued in this direction. I hope that we will soon get the desired result for us,&quot; he added. Ukraine aims to spend a record $35 billion on weapons production in 2025, according to Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. The Ukrainian government intends to provide $17 billion, while the rest may be financed by allies. The commander of a scandal-hit Ukrainian brigade has been detained, accused of failing to report violations in his unit, the State Bureau of Investigation said on Jan. 20. The 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Brigade was intended to be a flagship project for Ukrainian brigades trained and armed with the assistance of foreign partners. French President Emmanuel Macron announced in June that France would provide training and military supplies as part of this initiative. Despite Paris fulfilling its commitments for training and arms provision, an investigation led by Yurii Butusov, editor-in-chief of Ukrainian media outlet Censor.net, claimed soldiers of the unit, currently deployed near Pokrovsk, have suffered losses and gone AWOL (absent without leave) in large numbers due to poor command and organization within Ukraine&#x2019;s military leadership. The State Bureau of Investigation launched an investigation into the unit on Jan. 3. In a statement on Jan 20, the bureau said the commander &quot;did not respond to violations in his unit, including the unauthorized abandonment of the military unit by his fighters.&quot; &quot;The commander also deliberately failed to perform other actions assigned to him by his official duties. In particular, during 2024, he did not send a single report to pre-trial investigation bodies regarding subordinate servicemen who committed criminal offenses,&quot; it added. If found guilty, the commander faces up to 10 years in prison. The 155th Brigade has about 5,800 troops, fewer than 2,000 of whom have undergone training in France. It is armed with French AMX10 armored vehicles, Caesar howitzers, and German Leopard 2A4 tanks, among other weapons. According to Butusov&apos;s investigation, the unit&apos;s founding was &quot;organizational chaos&quot; from the very beginning. Even before the training in France began, 2,500 service members were reportedly sent to other units, thus removing many of the most qualified personnel from the brigade. Of the 1,924 soldiers eventually sent to France, only 51 had more than a year of military service, while 1,414 had served for less than two months, Butusov wrote. The unit was also plagued by large numbers of soldiers going AWOL &#x2014; about 50 deserted in France, in addition to hundreds who left their posts even before the unit was deployed at the front, according to the journalist. Between March and November, over 1,700 soldiers had gone AWOL, Butusov reported. Though the unit was replenished with new recruits, these often did not undergo a &quot;proper selection process,&quot; the journalist added. Highly-trained Air Force specialists are protected from being transferred to front-line infantry units, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Jan. 19. Reports last week indicated that since 2024, thousands of Air Force soldiers have been transferred to the Ground Forces. Videos filmed by Air Force specialists themselves then surfaced, claiming their transfer to front-line units was &quot;a real challenge&quot; that could &quot;destroy the very foundation of our aviation.&quot; The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces on Jan. 14 said the transfer of some personnel is &quot;a necessary step&quot; to strengthen defense by reinforcing combat brigades with soldiers from other branches of the Armed Forces. But it stressed that Syrskyi prohibited the transfer of high-tech specialists and those trained abroad on foreign models of weapons and equipment. &quot;I have an order prohibiting the transfer of highly qualified personnel who have undergone training and specialize in aircraft maintenance,&quot; Syrskyi reiterated in an interview with journalist Andriy Tsaplienko. &quot;Clearly, these are specialists on whom money has been spent, who have gained experience, and who are practically irreplaceable,&quot; he added. But in a separate interview with Ukrainian news outlet TSN on Jan. 19, Syrskyi &#xA0;acknowledged that current mobilization efforts are not sufficient on their own to meet the needs of the Armed Forces. Fighting has intensified in eastern Ukraine as Kyiv and Moscow try to gain an upper hand in potential upcoming peace negotiations following the inauguration of Donald Trump on Jan. 20. &quot;We have needs at the front. We must increase the number of personnel in our mechanized brigades, &quot; unfortunately, mobilization does not cover demand from the front line, Syrskyi said. President Volodymyr Zelensky released on Jan. 20 new footage of the interrogation of a North Korean soldier captured by the Ukrainian military. Ukrainian forces captured two North Korean soldiers in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast earlier in January. They are currently in the custody of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) in Kyiv. Both were wounded and are reportedly receiving medical attention. The prisoner of war (POW) in the newly released footage said he arrived in Russia on a cargo ferry with over 100 soldiers. He was not trained with Russian military equipment but claimed that several other North Korean soldiers were taught to do so. Communication between captured North Korean soldiers and SSU investigators continues. Intelligence data on the movement of such troops to Russian territory, their training and complete information isolation have been confirmed by the prisoners. All the facts about North&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/E2wiFlPBiw North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces against a Ukrainian incursion launched on Aug. 6. Ukrainian troops continue to operate in the region, leveraging their position for potential future negotiations. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) estimates that North Korean casualties have reached 300 killed and 2,700 wounded, attributing the losses to inadequate training and ineffective counter-drone tactics. The NIS also reported that some North Korean soldiers have been forced to commit suicide to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby echoed these claims on Dec. 27, adding that captured North Korean troops fear severe retaliation against their families if they surrender. Neither Russia nor North Korea have officially acknowledged the deployment, which is the latest move in Moscow&apos;s ever-increasing &#x2014; and humiliating &#x2014; reliance on Pyongyang to bolster its military, following long-running shipments of artillery shells and ballistic missiles. Russian forces suffered their heaviest losses last year since the start of the full-scale war, with total military losses reaching 434,000 soldiers, including approximately 150,000 killed in combat during 2024, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said in a Jan. 19 interview with the Ukrainian news outlet TSN. &quot;In this year of fighting, (Russian President Vladimir Putin) lost more than in the previous two years of the war (combined),&quot; Syrskyi said. As of Jan. 19, Russia has lost a total of 818,740 troops since the full-scale invasion began, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported. The estimate, which is broadly in-line with estimates made by Western intelligence agencies, likely includes those killed, captured, wounded, and missing. Russia has gained ground in eastern Ukraine and Kursk Oblast over the past year but at the cost of heavy casualties. Russian losses reached record highs in November and December, with a daily high of 2,030 troops lost in November, marking the highest daily loss since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Moscow does not disclose its casualty figures, though a Defense Ministry official recently let slip that the department received 48,000 requests to identify missing soldiers. According to a joint investigation by BBC Russia and Mediazona, journalists have identified the names of 88,726 Russian soldiers who died during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. According to the outlets&apos; conclusions for the year, 2024 will likely mark the &quot;war&apos;s deadliest year,&quot; with a current count of over 20,000 confirmed deaths over the past 12 months &#x2014; although final conclusions cannot yet be made as data on casualties continues to emerge. In December, President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed in a rare statement that Ukraine had lost 43,000 soldiers on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. When asked during the wide-ranging interview about the Ukrainian losses, Syrskyi broadly replied that there were &quot;many times&quot; less Ukrainian losses than those sustained by the Russians. At the current rate of Russian military casualties, Russian losses are expected to surpass 1 million troops within six months. Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on his upcoming inauguration and expressed readiness for dialogue during a Russian Security Council meeting on Jan. 20. Putin emphasized his openness to engaging with the incoming Trump administration, including discussions related to Russia&apos;s war war against Ukraine. &quot;We are open to dialogue with the new U.S. administration on the Ukrainian conflict (Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine). The most important thing here is to eliminate the root causes of the crisis,&quot; Putin said. This comes as reported peace proposals, including freezing the front lines, have been publicly rejected by Russia. Putin previously stated that his country would begin peace negotiations if Kyiv agreed to withdraw from the four Ukrainian regions &#x2014; Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson &#x2014; that it partly controls. Trump has signaled his intent to meet Putin &quot;very quickly&quot; after taking office, according to CNN. While the Kremlin welcomed the remarks, it noted that no preparations for the meeting are currently underway. Trump&apos;s team is reportedly working on arranging a call with Putin shortly after the inauguration, with the goal of initiating a settlement plan for the war in Ukraine within the first months of his presidency. During his campaign, Trump pledged to end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours, though his choice for Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, has since adjusted this timeline to 100 days.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ammunition-used-by-russians-halved-following-ukrainian-strikes-commander-of-scandal-hit-ukrainian-brigade-detained/	2025-01-20T12:23:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/2023-04-10-09.52.06.jpg
China’s support for Russia falls short in replacing Western materials, media reports	China has emerged as Russia&apos;s largest supplier of goods, but Chinese imports have failed to fully replace Western equipment and raw materials lost due to sanctions, The Moscow Times reported on Jan. 20, citing data from the Gaidar Institute. The trade between the two countries is hindered by payment difficulties as the West intensifies sanctions against Russia in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Chinese imports have partially compensated for Russian losses in key sectors. Medical and optical equipment imports rose by $1.3 billion annually compared to 2021, covering only 60% of pre-sanction European shipments. Plastics and polymers imports increased by $1.6 billion, replacing just 40% of EU supply. In mechanical equipment, Chinese imports covered 60% of losses, while electrical equipment saw less than 25% replacement. Chinese exports fell short in several categories. Aircraft shipments from Europe dropped by $3.1 billion annually, while Chinese exports amounted to only $201 million, just 7% of the shortfall. For pharmaceutical production, China supplied $108 million annually, far below the EU&apos;s pre-war level of $9.3 billion. Despite an initial surge in trade, growth has stagnated. After increasing by 30% in 2022 and 26% in 2023, mutual trade turnover grew by just 1.9% in 2024, reaching $244.8 billion. Chinese exports to Russia in yuan grew by only 5%, compared to 53% the previous year, while imports from Russia rose by 1%. Russian crude oil exports to China hit a record high in 2024, growing by 1% compared to 2023, according to Reuters. Broader trade figures highlight the limitations of Russia&apos;s pivot to China in offsetting the impact of Western sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinas-support-for-russia-falls-short-in-replacing-western-materials-media-reports/	2025-01-20T11:57:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2153185709.jpg
Arms procurement head should keep post, supervisory board says	The supervisory board of Ukraine&#x2019;s Defense Procurement Agency advised the Defense Minister to extend its director&#x2019;s work in a statement posted on Facebook on Jan. 20. &#x201C;The Supervisory Board submitted to Defense Minister Rustem Umerov a recommendation to extend the contract of the current director of the Defense Procurement Agency, Maryna Bezrukova, for one year,&#x201D; the statement read. Separate boards were set up for Ukraine&#x2019;s lethal and non-lethal procurement agencies, complying with NATO standards, in the fall of 2024. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov planned to merge the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA) and the State Logistics Operator (DOT) into one agency but changed his mind after a NATO statement said that the two agencies should be kept separate and two separate supervisory boards should be established. Bezrukova, a former employee of Ukraine&#x2019;s energy company Ukrenergo, was appointed to head the DPA. &#x201C;This decision is based on an assessment of her performance and the need to ensure stability and efficiency in procurement management in wartime,&#x201D; the supervisory board statement read. In a separate move, the supervisory board also announced initiating an independent audit by the International Board of Auditors of NATO (IBAN), the results of which will form a &#x201C;center of excellence for Ukraine&apos;s military procurement,&#x201D; the statement read.	https://kyivindependent.com/arms-procurement-head-should-keep-post-supervisory-board-says/	2025-01-20T11:25:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/DSC01273.jpg
False story' — Denmark denies Russian claims of F-16 instructor killed in Kryvyi Rih strike	The Danish Defense Ministry on Jan. 19 denied Russian claims of the death of a Danish F-16 instructor in a missile strike on Kryvyi Rih, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, on Jan. 17. &quot;This is a false story being spread by the Russian media &#x2014; probably with the aim of discrediting Denmark,&quot; Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said. The Russian strike killed four people and injured 14 others, with damage reported to high-rise buildings, houses, vehicles, and an educational institution. Russian state news agency TASS alleged on Jan. 18 that a Danish F-16 instructor was killed during the attack, citing unnamed sources in Russia&apos;s security services. Denmark&apos;s Defense Ministry dismissed the report as false, emphasizing that no Danish military personnel have died in Ukraine. Poulsen condemned the disinformation, citing it as part of broader influence campaigns amid a serious security situation. Denmark, along with the Netherlands, has provided Ukraine with U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets, which have been used in air defense operations to counter Russian missile strikes on cities and infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/false-story-denmark-denies-russian-claims-of-f-16-instructor-killed-in-kryvyi-rih-strike/	2025-01-20T10:03:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2171996068.jpg
Massive Russian hack on government database shows cracks in Ukraine's digitalization drive	At the start of December, Ukrainians suddenly found themselves unable to sell cars, file legal claims, or register marriages through Ukraine&#x2019;s recently digitized government registries. Cybersecurity specialist and frequent coordinator of Ukrainian hackers, Karla Wagner, noticed when she went to register an NGO through the Ukrainian Justice Ministry. &#x201C;I was getting inconsistent results from the Justice Ministry website; I was able to submit the document, but I was not able to digitally sign it. And at first, I was annoyed because I&apos;m thinking, yeah, this is a crappy system,&#x201D; says Wagner. &#x201C;I was getting different results every time, from timeouts to errors to &#x2018;something didn&apos;t seem to work right, please try again later.&#x2019;&#x201D; The Justice Ministry on Dec. 19 formally announced that a Russian hack had taken a laundry list of critical government databases that had been put under the Justice Ministry offline. The databases contain sensitive information from property ownership to biometric data to tax records. Relevant Ukrainian offices quickly called it an act of war from Russia. &#x201C;The information space is one of the key directions of the enemy&#x2019;s attacks,&#x201D; wrote the State Communications Service, the national cybersecurity agency, in a statement provided to the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Russian hackers, who have become full-fledged participants in this war, are constantly getting better, improving their toolkits, tactics and strategy of operations.&#x201D; The statement contained no information on the technical details as to how the systems were compromised. XakNet, a hacking group previously tied to Russian intelligence, took credit for the attack, posting on Telegram data they claim to have hacked from the Ukrainian civil registry. The hackers claimed to have deleted at least some of the registry data. The Justice Ministry has since announced that all its state registries were ready to operate but that access to some registers was still limited, as their data still needs to be updated. Access to government services through the Diia app would be available in the near future, the ministry said on Jan. 20. The hack posed a major informational threat, highlighting how vulnerable government and Ukrainians&#x2019; personal data is to cyber attacks. In pushing to digitize its services quickly, the government also may have taken shortcuts that opened the door to digital onslaughts. Attacks of these kinds also erode public trust in the government, experts say. The core problem, as Wagner diagnoses, was the pace at which Ukraine rewired systems ranging from passports to tax payments into a single digital portal, all under the auspices of the Justice Ministry, in order to show positive results to foreign observers. &#x201C;It was very, very, very, very, very fast progress,&#x201D; says Wagner. &#x201C;And any IT project that has the heat on to make fast progress will cut corners where needed and save resources where needed with the best of intentions, which is meeting the deadlines and satisfying the requirements. (That) created not only a long string of vulnerabilities but also over-centralization in tech admin infrastructure.&#x201D; A woman uses her laptop as she takes shelter in a metro station during an air strike alarm in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Nov. 20, 2024, amid the Russian invasion. (Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)Mykyta Knysh, who formerly worked in cybersecurity for Ukraine&#x2019;s security services, the SBU, and currently runs the hacking collective &#x201C;HackYourMama,&#x201D; says the agencies involved should have known better. &#x201C;I understand that the Justice Ministry doesn&#x2019;t necessarily have to have this kind of expertise, but the State Office of Security and Communications, the Digital Transformation Ministry, the SBU &#x2014; they should have that expertise,&#x201D; says Knysh. Hardly the most eye-catching of Russia&#x2019;s military operations against Ukraine since the full-scale invasion, the attack nonetheless presents a serious threat to Ukraine&#x2019;s security. &#x201C;If the Russians occupy more territory they can use that information, maybe to threaten or blackmail or defraud people who fall under them,&#x201D; says Knysh. Knysh hails from Kupiansk, a town in eastern Kharkiv Oblast that currently lies within five miles of Russian positions. The registries attacked included information like individuals&#x2019; addresses and assets, as well as familial relationships. It is not yet known whether the hackers involved have actually re-written the information for certain civilians. Knysh fears the hackers may have forged digital identities to grant Russian agents access to the front. The hack &#x201C;provides opportunities for Russian intelligence to obtain additional information about Ukrainian military and civilian government employees, and identify vulnerable or otherwise suitable people in Ukraine who can be recruited or coerced into conducting espionage activities and sabotage,&#x201D; analysts at cybersecurity firm Flashpoint wrote in a comments to the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;However, more likely uses of such information include conducting future cyberattacks on other organizations in Ukraine using the information from public registries for reconnaissance, identity theft, social engineering, doxxing, harassment, and crafting convincing phishing emails,&#x201D; Flashpoint wrote.

(Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu via Getty Images)Oleh Burba, who works as a component leader for EU4DigitalUA and coordinates registry integration says that while anything is theoretically possible if Russians have the access, there is currently no confirmed information they have changed anything in the registries. Though any such impacts have yet to materialize, the attack has already proved a major inconvenience to civil society, which Wagner sees as the biggest issue. &#x201C;You attack the Justice Ministry and the day-to-day business of government cannot go on,&#x201D; says Wagner. &#x201C;Okay, nobody&apos;s going to die if I can&apos;t register my NGO. But it erodes confidence in the Ukrainian government.&#x201D; For Russia, Wagner considers it an extension of a propaganda war, similar to bombardments of Ukrainian national monuments. &#x201C;You don&apos;t need to hit strategic targets in a country. All you have to do is make it appear to be ungovernable.&#x201D; XakNet hackers also claimed to have destroyed backup data in servers in Poland. In its message the hacker group mocks Ukraine&#x2019;s government, saying: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s very telling to store government data on foreign storage &#x2014; that&#x2019;s what independence Ukrainian-style looks like, apparently.&#x201D; The systems affected were under the umbrella of massive digitalization of government services that has taken place under the administration of President Volodymyr Zelensky, particularly his Digital Transformation Minister Mikhailo Fedorov. This digitalization has been enormously popular, largely seen as reducing opportunities for low-level corruption among a patchwork of regional agencies ruled by unscrupulous bureaucrats. But cybersecurity experts question the wisdom of the technical centralization of these systems within one office, with Knysh jokingly dubbing Fedorov&#x2019;s agency the &#x201C;Digital Degradation Ministry.&#x201D; &#x201C;At the beginning of the full-scale invasion we realized that Ukraine&apos;s digital infrastructure was overly centralized, according to the old Soviet model,&#x201D; says Wagner. &#x201C;Centralization and single points of failure are a well-known anti-pattern. And it&apos;s highly vulnerable.&#x201D; &#x201C;My personal opinion was that (the hack) was through this system, &#x2018;Trembita,&#x2019;&#x201C; says Knysh. Trembita is a core data management system that provides the backend for government systems, specifically Diia, an app that has digitized government services like passports and tax paying. Knysh helped organize a hack on Russia&#x2019;s government services portal last year that among other impacts, immobilized digital voting. Independent hackers have been warning government agencies about the centralization of everyone&#x2019;s information under Diia since 2021. Trembita manages the digital communication between different registries. &#x201C;Trembita is a trip by rail,&#x201D; wrote Burba in an op-ed for Economic Pravda defending the system in May, describing the registries as cities, their digital links as railroads, and individual identifying codes as tickets. A mobile phone displays an error message for a marriage online on the &apos;Diia&apos; mobile app in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Sept. 10, 2024. (Viktor Fridshon / Global Images Ukraine / Getty Images)&#x201C;Trembita specifically in this situation was not damaged or broken, it functioned just as it should have functioned and protected the information exchange between these registries,&#x201D; Burba told the Kyiv Independent. Knysh is especially concerned that authorities provided no details on the hack, citing &#x201C;a whole monopoly on what they are saying.&#x201D; Given that hackers re-use hacking techniques, he was concerned for other nations. It&#x2019;s not a problem limited to the Zelensky cyber team and Digital Transformation Ministry. Having worked for the Ukrainian SBU under former president Petro Poroshenko&apos;s administration, Knysh says &#x201C;Poroshenko was almost just the same,&#x201D; and acknowledged the need for a stronger digitized and federalized system of managing data. &#x201C;Before Trembita, there was total chaos,&#x201D; says Knysh. &#x201C;But then they said &#x2018;you will have a government of smartphones&#x2019; and now we have a government of smartphones open to the SBU and HUR,&#x201D; he continued, referencing Ukrainian intelligence agencies. Hackers can find backdoors left open to governments, as for example a series of legal battles to compel Apple to extract data for U.S. intelligence agencies laid out. Officials are touting an overhaul, with Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna dubbing a pending rebuild into a &#x201C;Pentagon of registries.&#x201D; What exactly a &#x201C;Pentagon of registries&#x201D; means is unclear. For Wagner, it&#x2019;s fairly simple: &#x201C;Nothing.&#x201D; &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not an emotionally mature approach,&#x201D; says Wagner, miming beating her chest. &#x201C;I heard this (Pentagon of Registries) and I thought, &#x201C;Go out and say honestly, &#x2018;we don&#x2019;t know how to make a safe system.&#x2019;&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/massive-russian-hack-on-government-database-shows-cracks-in-ukraines-warp-speed-digitalization-drive/	2025-01-20T09:12:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/upd_GettyImages-2167201208.jpg
Trump sworn in as 47th US president	Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States in a ceremony held in the United States Capitol on Jan. 20. Vice President J.D. Vance took the oath of office alongside the president. Trump assumes office as the war in Ukraine enters its third year. While Trump initially vowed to end the war within 24 hours, his team later revised the timeline to 100 days, citing the intricate challenges of resolving the conflict. Ukraine remains cautious about the incoming administration, as Trump&apos;s past remarks on NATO and his perceived sympathies toward Russian President Vladimir Putin raise concerns about potential compromises unfavorable to Kyiv. During his first meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in December, Trump acknowledged Ukraine&apos;s desire for a ceasefire but avoided discussing specifics. Trump has pledged to meet with Putin &quot;very quickly&quot; and has tasked his aides with organizing a call. According to CNN, discussions for a face-to-face meeting are ongoing. Since his election victory on Nov. 5, Trump and his administration have sent mixed signals about their approach to peace. Trump&apos;s national security picks illustrate a range of perspectives on Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Tulsi Gabbard, nominated for director of national intelligence, has opposed U.S. support for Ukraine and faced criticism for echoing Russian narratives. Michael Waltz, the likely national security advisor, and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state nominee, are considered hawkish on Russia. Defense Secretary nominee Peter Hegseth, an isolationist, walked back earlier calls to scale back U.S. involvement in NATO during confirmation hearings, emphasizing the alliance&apos;s importance. Special envoy nominee for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg has co-authored a draft peace plan involving a frozen front line, a delay in Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership, and European peacekeepers in Ukraine. The plan also reportedly proposes continued U.S. military aid and security guarantees for Kyiv, though it partially lifts sanctions on Russia. Kellogg insists the proposals aim to &quot;save Ukraine and their sovereignty,&quot; not to appease Russia. Moscow has dismissed Trump&apos;s signals as &quot;unformed&quot; and reiterated demands for Ukraine&apos;s territorial concessions and NATO exclusion. Putin has expressed willingness for dialogue, though he maintains his insistence on Russia&apos;s terms, including complete control of four Ukrainian regions. Trump has urged European leaders to take a more active role in deterring Russian aggression, including deploying peacekeepers and pressuring China to influence Russia through trade measures. Officials close to Trump maintain that U.S. military aid to Ukraine will persist, focusing on empowering Kyiv to negotiate from a position of strength.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-sworn-in-as-47th-us-president/	2025-01-20T09:02:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194362623.jpg
Lithuania sends drones, thermal imagers, loaders in new Ukraine aid package, Defense Ministry says	Ukraine received a new military aid package from Lithuania, including domestically-produced drones, thermal imagers, and five-ton telescopic loaders, the Defense Ministry announced on Jan. 20. &quot;Keeping Ukraine safe means taking care of our security. We have as much time as Ukraine has,&quot; Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene said. The country has also removed bureaucratic barriers to expedite the delivery of support to Ukraine. Vilnius has committed to prioritizing air defense systems, ammunition, drones, and anti-drone weapons in its 2025 aid packages, along with funding Ukraine&apos;s defense industry to boost local production. Kyiv plans to spend a record $35 billion on arms production in 2025, of which $17 billion will be financed by the Ukrainian government, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Jan. 13. Lithuania has been a steadfast ally of Ukraine, pledging 0.25% of its GDP annually in military assistance. By October 2024, Vilnius had provided &#x20AC;840 million ($860 million) in aid, making it one of the top donors relative to GDP, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-sends-drones-thermal-imagers-loaders-in-new-ukraine-aid-defense-ministry-says/	2025-01-20T08:53:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/1-4.webp
Russia's primitive glide bombs are still outmatching Ukraine's air defenses, killing more civilians	When a glide bomb exploded at an industrial facility in Zaporizhzhia on Jan. 8, the 13 dead, and 122 injured marked the highest number of civilian casualties in a Russian attack on Ukraine in almost two years. Despite being one of the most primitive and numerous weapons in the Russian Air Force&apos;s arsenal, Ukraine&apos;s sophisticated, Western-supplied air defense systems are still ill-equipped to deal with the threat they pose. Compounding the problem, Russia continues to modify and adapt its glide bombs, increasing their range and destructive power, meaning more and more Ukrainian towns and cities are coming under threat. &quot;Aerial glide bombs have become one of the greatest threats to civilians in cities along the frontline,&quot; Danielle Bell, head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU), said in a statement on Jan. 9. &quot;They are also one of the main reasons why the number of killed and injured in 2024 increased by 30 per cent compared with 2023.&quot; According to HRMMU figures, Russian glide bombs killed 360 Ukrainian civilians in 2024, and injured 1,861, a threefold increase in fatalities, and a sixfold increase in injuries compared to 2023. A glide bomb is a standard air-dropped bomb modified with wings and often a satellite navigation system, so they can be launched from a distance rather than directly over a target. Their origins date back as far as World War II, and have been used in conflicts since including Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Russian glide bombs are often Soviet-era FAB weapons upgraded with a Unified Gliding and Correction Module (UMPK), which allows it to glide to its target, but Moscow is also developing newer, dedicated versions.

(Russian Defense Ministry / Handout / Anadolu via Getty Images)Russian forces employ various sizes of glide bombs weighing 250, 500, and 1,000 kilograms (kg). The most powerful in Russia&apos;s arsenal is the FAB-3000, a 3,000-kilogram high-explosive bomb, which the Russian Defense Ministry claimed in March had gone into mass production. In July, it released footage of what it said was a FAB-3000 being dropped on Ukrainian territory for the first time, saying it has a combat power that &quot;cannot be ignored.&quot; Crucially, converting an unguided &quot;dumb bomb&quot; into a glide bomb is cheap. Each conversion costs around $20,000, far less than cruise and ballistic missiles that cost millions of dollars to produce. Russian forces began using glide bombs against Ukraine in early 2023 to compensate for the lack of precision-guided munitions, dropping hundreds a week, according to figures from Kyiv.

(Ivan Samoilov / Gwara Media / Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Glide bombs are most effective against static targets, including &#x200B;&#x200B;bridges, command posts, bunkers, and weapons depots, and Russia has used them to great effect on the front lines as they advance slowly in eastern Ukraine. &quot;Despite many problems and shortfalls, the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) is learning, and adapting its tactics in a constantly changing combat environment,&quot; Federico Borsari, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent. But Moscow has also used them to devastating effect against Ukrainian population centers, with Sumy, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts particularly hard hit. Glide bombs are highly-destructive, and incredibly difficult to shoot down. &quot;Glide bombs, unlike missiles, do not have a propulsion system, so they don&apos;t generate much heat and are therefore largely immune to interception by infrared homing missiles, like the AIM-9 Sidewinder, or the FIM-92 Stinger,&quot; Jacob Parakilas, research leader in RAND Europe&apos;s Defence, Security and Justice Research Group, told the Kyiv Independent. Parakilas said anti-aircraft guns like the German-made Gepard are more effective at shooting down glide bombs, but their short range makes them ineffective at policing the hundreds of miles of front line in Ukraine. &quot;The limited range of those systems means that they would have to be right on top of the target, and able to identify and open fire on it in a very short time window &#x2014; which is difficult even if sufficient numbers of those systems were available,&quot; he said. The range of the weapons also allows the Russian fighter jets that launch them to stay out of range of Ukraine&apos;s advanced air defense systems such as the U.S.-supplied Patriot. Ukraine did have a string of successes early last year, downing several Russian military planes of the types used to launch glide bombs. But positioning air defense assets so close to the front lines is risky, and after Russian forces allegedly managed to destroy two Patriot launchers in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine appears to have abandoned the tactic. &quot;Russia can exploit gaps in Ukraine&apos;s air defense, which is stretched thin and needs to cover a very large territory,&quot; Borsari said. Russia is constantly upgrading UMPK kits to increase the range and accuracy of its glide bombs. When interviewed by the Kyiv Independent in May of last year, experts said the range of glide bombs being used by Russia was &quot;generally considered not to exceed 50-60 kilometers.&quot; But in the months since, a number of modifications mean newer models can now fly up to 90 kilometers, placing many more Ukrainian civilians within their deadly reach.

(Yevhen Titov / Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Borsari said that particular attention should be paid to the relatively new and more advanced UMPB-D-30SN system which, in addition to wings and a guidance system, also has a small jet-propulsion engine which extends the glide bomb&apos;s range. Then there are the improvements to the electronic systems. Russian forces have been improving the navigation systems that guide the UMPK via satellite, allowing it to be more accurate. They are also often equipped with Kometa antennas which stabilize satellite communications signals, and are particularly resistant to electronic warfare countermeasures. In lieu of an effective means of targeting glide bombs in flight, experts say Ukraine&apos;s best options are to target both the planes that drop them, as well as the production and storage facilities they pass through before they&apos;re used. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s allies should prioritize speeding up the pipeline for delivering, supporting, and providing training for the crews of F-16s, which can target and push back the Russian jets dropping glide bombs,&quot; Parakilas said. The first General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons received by Ukraine fly on the Day of Ukrainian Air Force in an unspecified location, Ukraine, on Aug. 4, 2024. (Vitalii Nosach / Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)&quot;Adding other air defense fighters &#x2014; as France has promised to do with the Mirage 2000 and Sweden has considered with the Gripen &#x2014; would also help, although every new type of aircraft added increases the complexity of Ukraine&apos;s supporting infrastructure and supply chain,&quot; he added. Ukraine&apos;s long-running, long-range drone strike campaign has reportedly had successes targeting sites where Russia stores FAB bombs, most recently in a series of strikes last week. But their continued and widespread use suggests Ukraine can&apos;t currently destroy them at a rate quicker than Russia can produce them. &quot;In the long-term, another possibility is the use of directed-energy weapons, such as lasers, which are being developed and tested in various countries as a cost-effective countermeasure to aerial threats,&quot; Eken said. However, the widespread deployment of such weapons is far off, and in the meantime, more and more Ukrainian towns and cities are likely to come within range of Russia&apos;s ever-evolving glide bombs.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-primitive-glide-bombs-are-still-outmatching-ukraines-air-defenses-killing-more-civilians-2/	2025-01-20T07:00:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192463415.jpg
Putin congratulates Trump amid inauguration, signals readiness for talks	Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on his upcoming inauguration and expressed readiness for dialogue during a Russian Security Council meeting on Jan. 20. Putin emphasized his openness to engaging with the incoming Trump administration, including discussions related to Russia&apos;s war war against Ukraine. &quot;We are open to dialogue with the new U.S. administration on the Ukrainian conflict (Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine). The most important thing here is to eliminate the root causes of the crisis,&quot; Putin said. This comes as reported peace proposals, including freezing the front lines, have been publicly rejected by Russia. Putin previously stated that his country would begin peace negotiations if Kyiv agreed to withdraw from the four Ukrainian regions &#x2014; Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson &#x2014; that it partly controls. Trump has signaled his intent to meet Putin &quot;very quickly&quot; after taking office, according to CNN. While the Kremlin welcomed the remarks, it noted that no preparations for the meeting are currently underway. Trump&apos;s team is reportedly working on arranging a call with Putin shortly after the inauguration, with the goal of initiating a settlement plan for the war in Ukraine within the first months of his presidency. During his campaign, Trump pledged to end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours, though his choice for Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, has since adjusted this timeline to 100 days.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-congratulates-trump-amid-inauguration-signals-readiness-for-talks/	2025-01-20T06:50:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1066818340.jpg
Commander of scandal-hit Ukrainian brigade detained, accused of failing to report desertions	The commander of a scandal-hit Ukrainian brigade has been detained, accused of failing to report violations in his unit, the State Bureau of Investigation said on Jan. 20. The 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Brigade was intended to be a flagship project for Ukrainian brigades trained and armed with the assistance of foreign partners. French President Emmanuel Macron announced in June that France would provide training and military supplies as part of this initiative. Despite Paris fulfilling its commitments for training and arms provision, an investigation led by Yurii Butusov, editor-in-chief of Ukrainian media outlet Censor.net, claimed soldiers of the unit, currently deployed near Pokrovsk, have suffered losses and gone AWOL (absent without leave) in large numbers due to poor command and organization within Ukraine&#x2019;s military leadership. The State Bureau of Investigation launched an investigation into the unit on Jan. 3. In a statement on Jan 20, the bureau said the commander &quot;did not respond to violations in his unit, including the unauthorized abandonment of the military unit by his fighters.&quot; &quot;The commander also deliberately failed to perform other actions assigned to him by his official duties. In particular, during 2024, he did not send a single report to pre-trial investigation bodies regarding subordinate servicemen who committed criminal offenses,&quot; it added. If found guilty, the commander faces up to 10 years in prison. The 155th Brigade has about 5,800 troops, fewer than 2,000 of whom have undergone training in France. It is armed with French AMX10 armored vehicles, Caesar howitzers, and German Leopard 2A4 tanks, among other weapons. According to Butusov&apos;s investigation, the unit&apos;s founding was &quot;organizational chaos&quot; from the very beginning. Even before the training in France began, 2,500 service members were reportedly sent to other units, thus removing many of the most qualified personnel from the brigade. Of the 1,924 soldiers eventually sent to France, only 51 had more than a year of military service, while 1,414 had served for less than two months, Butusov wrote. The unit was also plagued by large numbers of soldiers going AWOL &#x2014; about 50 deserted in France, in addition to hundreds who left their posts even before the unit was deployed at the front, according to the journalist. Between March and November, over 1,700 soldiers had gone AWOL, Butusov reported. Though the unit was replenished with new recruits, these often did not undergo a &quot;proper selection process,&quot; the journalist added.	https://kyivindependent.com/commander-of-scandal-hit-ukrainian-brigade-detained-accused-of-failing-to-report-desertions/	2025-01-20T06:11:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-20-at-15_59_41.png
Trump sees peace in Ukraine as a deal but refuses to play his winning hand	The impending Donald Trump presidency has fueled market speculation that a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine could be reached soon &#x2014; bolstered by Trump&#x2019;s campaign trail rhetoric promising to end the war within days of taking office, if not sooner. Ukrainian Eurobonds have been among the best-performing assets in emerging markets in recent months, notably alongside Lebanon, another &quot;war or peace&quot; play. However, achieving a durable peace deal between Ukraine and Russia may not be as simple as Trump has implied &#x2014; a realization that seems to have dawned on him. His initial promise of peace within days has now been extended to six months. General Keith Kellogg, Trump&#x2019;s designated Ukraine envoy, has also tempered expectations, expressing hope for a breakthrough within the first 100 days of the Trump administration &#x2014; a timeframe that is likely to slip further. Does Trump actually have a peace plan for Ukraine? It&#x2019;s doubtful. The shifting deadlines for progress reflect this uncertainty. Trump and Kellogg don&#x2019;t appear to have a deep understanding of Ukraine, Putin, or European security. Ukraine&#x2019;s fate doesn&#x2019;t seem to rank high among Trump&#x2019;s priorities, which focus instead on &quot;Making America Great Again.&quot; Campaign promises to pull financial support for Ukraine resonated with voters when framed as reallocating resources to neglected U.S. communities. However, even if U.S. support for Ukraine is cut, it&#x2019;s unlikely those funds will find their way to disadvantaged Rust Belt communities. For Trump, Ukraine is a problem for Europe. His recent comments about U.S. territorial ambitions &#x2014; regarding Canada, Greenland, and Panama &#x2014; suggest his intent to extract a quid pro quo from Russian President Vladimir Putin for signing off on Russian territorial gains in Ukraine. Trump may be signaling that if he accepts Russia&#x2019;s terms, he expects something in return, such as turning a blind eye to a U.S. claim on Greenland. This mindset underscores Trump&#x2019;s transactional approach, with Ukraine at risk of being sold out in the process. While Kellogg and Mike Waltz, Trump&#x2019;s pick for national security adviser, might attempt to articulate a coherent strategy, it&#x2019;s unclear if Trump is aligned with their efforts. Trump holds significant leverage over Putin, particularly regarding Ukraine. Russia needs a deal more than the U.S. does. A prolonged war risks economic collapse from sanctions, potential Yevgeny Prigozhin-style military mutinies, and rising social unrest. While Ukraine also faces challenges &#x2014; manpower shortages and donor fatigue &#x2014; these are manageable compared to the risks for Putin. For the U.S., the cost of supporting Ukraine, at roughly $100 billion over three years (40% from the U.S.), is a fraction of the defense budget. Much of this spending benefits the U.S. directly through payments for American arms, often older equipment being replaced by modern upgrades. Additionally, the war has prompted NATO allies and Ukraine to ramp up U.S. arms purchases, while Europe is expected to increase defense spending by over $250 billion annually. The longer the war continues, the more the U.S. benefits economically while Russia&#x2019;s capabilities are depleted &#x2014; all without risking U.S. troops.

(Charly Truballeau/AFP/Getty Images)A more effective negotiating strategy for Trump would be to pressure Putin by threatening increased support for Ukraine or imposing harsher sanctions on Russia&#x2019;s economy &#x2014; steps that would come at minimal cost to the U.S. Trump could signal support for Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership or approve the use of long-range missiles capable of striking deep into Russia. He holds all the leverage. Yet, instead of using this leverage, the Trump administration appears to be giving it away to Putin. Trump has signaled no NATO membership for Ukraine, no long-range missiles, a halt to financial aid for Ukraine, and potential sanctions relief for Russia. Meanwhile, figures like Kellogg and Waltz have floated proposals to freeze front lines, effectively allowing Russia to retain the territory it currently occupies. Despite holding all the aces, Trump seems to have handed the game to Putin. For Ukraine, security is paramount in any peace deal. The country can survive losing the territories currently occupied by Russia, but its economic prospects depend on security guarantees. These could come through NATO membership, bilateral security assurances, or robust Western military and financial support akin to the U.S.-Israel relationship. However, Trump&#x2019;s concessions &#x2014; rejecting NATO membership and dismissing bilateral guarantees &#x2014; have shifted the debate to limiting Ukraine&#x2019;s defensive capabilities. Putin will exploit this to keep Ukraine vulnerable to future invasion, deterring investment and stalling reconstruction. The resulting insecurity would discourage millions of Ukrainian refugees from returning home, risking further emigration and domestic instability. Europe faces dire consequences if Ukraine collapses: waves of Ukrainian refugees, fueling far-right populism, and a bolstered Russian military-industrial complex. A resurgent Russia, emboldened by victory in Ukraine, might target the Baltics or Moldova next. Europe&#x2019;s security hinges on Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to defend itself as the front line against Russian aggression. Trump may not grasp the stakes for Europe, but European leaders must. With the U.S. stepping back, Europe must wake up to its existential threat from Russia and take responsibility for Ukraine&#x2019;s defense. A $150 billion annual price tag to support Ukraine is manageable for Europe&#x2019;s $25 trillion economy &#x2014; especially compared to the $250-$500 billion yearly increase in defense spending likely required if Ukraine falls. Unlocking the $330 billion in immobilized Russian central bank assets could provide Ukraine with significant financing. Additionally, Europe should appeal to Trump&#x2019;s economic priorities by framing support for Ukraine as a boon for U.S. jobs, branding it as the &quot;Trump Plan for the Defense of Europe&quot; or a modern Marshall Plan. Unfortunately, European leaders remain in denial, ignoring the risks of a Trump presidency and failing to connect the dots between Ukraine&#x2019;s security and their own. Ensuring Ukraine&#x2019;s stability isn&#x2019;t just about protecting one country&#x2014;it&#x2019;s about safeguarding the future of Europe as a whole.

China imports record amount of Russian crude oil in 2024, Reuters reports	Imports of Russian crude oil to China reached a record high in 2024, rising by 1% compared to 2023, Reuters reported on Jan. 20. The Russian fossil fuel industry is the primary economic driver of Moscow&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Despite sanctions and Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil production, China, the world&apos;s largest crude oil buyer, continues to import from Russia. According to China&apos;s General Administration of Customs, in 2024, 108.5 million metric tons were imported, including through pipelines and sea deliveries, equivalent to nearly 2.17 million barrels per day. Meanwhile, China has reduced supplies from Saudi Arabia by 9%. Saudi Arabia shipped 78.64 million tons, or about 1.57 million barrels per day, which is 1.72 million barrels per day less than in 2023. China has been reducing its imports from Saudi Arabia due to rising crude oil prices in the country and the growing share of oil from Russia and Iran at lower prices, according to Reuters. Yet, in the fourth quarter, Saudi Arabia&apos;s share of China&apos;s imports increased after Iran&apos;s supplies declined and prices of the OPEC oil cartel, which Russia is a member of, fell. China also imported 28% more than usual from Malaysia, the main transshipment center for sanctioned oil from Iran and Venezuela. In December, almost 295,000 tons were exported from Venezuela. This country&apos;s total volume of supplies in 2024 amounted to 1.5 million tons or 30,000 barrels per day. No oil imports from Iran were recorded for the whole of 2024. Total crude oil imports to China decreased by 1.9%. This is the first annual decline since the pandemic due to weak economic growth and lower demand for fuel, Reuters reported. China has deepened its ties with Russia since the start of the Kremlin&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, although Beijing has denied accusations of supporting Russia&#x2019;s military efforts. Mounting economic pressure has nevertheless forced many Chinese financial institutions to scale down their economic ties with Russia, fearing secondary sanctions.	https://kyivindependent.com/china-imports-record-amount-of-russian-crude-oil-in-2024-reuters-says/	2025-01-20T05:42:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1209343725--1-.jpg
I didn't know who I'd be fighting' — North Korean soldier captured by Ukraine speaks in new footage	President Volodymyr Zelensky released on Jan. 20 new footage of the interrogation of a North Korean soldier captured by the Ukrainian military. Ukrainian forces captured two North Korean soldiers in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast earlier in January. Both soldiers were injured but survived. The prisoner of war (POW) said he arrived in Russia on a cargo ferry with over 100 soldiers. He was not trained with Russian military equipment but claimed that several other North Korean soldiers were taught to do so. Communication between captured North Korean soldiers and SSU investigators continues. Intelligence data on the movement of such troops to Russian territory, their training and complete information isolation have been confirmed by the prisoners. All the facts about North&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/E2wiFlPBiw He joined the army at the age of 17 and served on conscript duty in a reconnaissance battalion and said his mother does not know where he is now. The POW said he did not know he was going to war or know who he would be fighting against. The full conversation conducted via a translator is as follows: Interrogator: Did you and other North Korean servicemen undergo training on the use of Russian weapons and military equipment? If so, where and when? POW/Translator: There were a few soldiers from North Korea who were trained to use heavy Russian equipment, but I personally did not undergo such training. Interrogator: Where did you serve? In which unit? POW: (I work) in a reconnaissance battalion. Interrogator: Does your mother know where you are? POW: No she doesn&apos;t. Interrogator: How many people were on the ship that transported you from North Korea to Russia? POW: Approximately over one hundred. Interrogator: What kind of ship was it? POW: I believe it was a Russian ferry, but not a military vessel &#x2014; just one for transporting cargo. Interrogator: Were only people on board or was there cargo as well? POW: It was only us. Interrogator: How many seats were in the train car you traveled in? POW: The same people who were on the ferry were also on the train &#x2014; there were no others, it was the same group. Interrogator: Were there beds in the carriage, how many? POW: There were six tables and beds. In total there were about 100 people. Interrogator: Tell us about the beginning of your service in the ranks of the North Korean armed forces. Specifically, when did you begin your military service? How did it happen and so on? Where did you serve? POW: Typically, after finishing school all men join the military. I also joined the army after finishing school and joined the reconnaissance division and stayed there for my entire service. Interrogator: How old were you when you started your service? POW: I was 17 years old. Interrogator: Are you serving under contract or conscription? POW: Not under contract, conscription. Interrogator: Do you voluntarily wish to give truthful testimony about the circumstances of your participation in hostilities against Ukraine? POW: First of all, as I&apos;ve already said, I didn&apos;t know before coming to Russia that I would be fighting here, in Russia and I didn&apos;t even know who we were fighting against. Interrogator: What do you know about the losses suffered by North Korean units during combat operations against the Armed Forces of Ukraine? In which battles, from what types of weapons, and how many casualties &#x2014; both wounded and irrecoverable? POW: There were a lot of casualties when I was there alone, starting from the battle on Jan. 3. Overall, it&apos;s hard to answer about such large-scale numbers. Interrogator: What did you know about the world outside of North Korea? POW: Not much. Interrogator: Did you know anything about South Korea? What did you know? POW: I only know that South Korea has fewer mountains than North Korea. North Korean troops were deployed to Kursk Oblast last fall to support Russian forces against a Ukrainian incursion launched on Aug. 6. Ukrainian troops continue to operate in the region, leveraging their positions for potential future negotiations. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) estimates that North Korean casualties have reached 300 killed and 2,700 wounded, attributing the losses to inadequate training and ineffective counter-drone tactics. The NIS also reported that some North Korean soldiers have been forced to commit suicide to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby echoed these claims on Dec. 27, adding that captured North Korean troops fear severe retaliation against their families if they surrender.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-releases-new-footage-of-interrogation-of-north-korean-soldier-captured-by-ukraine/	2025-01-20T04:18:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-11_13-23-35.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 2, injure 5 over past day	Russian strikes against Ukraine killed two civilians and injured five over the past day, regional authorities reported on Jan. 20. Russian forces launched 141 drones at Ukraine overnight from the Russian cities of Bryansk, Kursk, Orel, Millerovo, and Primosk-Akhtarsk, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Russia also struck Sumy Oblast with an Iskander-M ballistic missile from Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare units, mobile firing groups, and aviation shot down 93 drones in Kyiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kherson, Vinnytsia, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Donetsk, and Mykolaiv oblasts. Forty-seven drones were lost allegedly due to electronic warfare countermeasures. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 32 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, over the past day. As a result of the attacks, one person was killed, and two others were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. In Donetsk Oblast, one person was killed, and another one was injured in the town of Pokrovsk, while one person was also injured in the village of Mykolaivka due to Russian strikes, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Kharkiv Oblast, a 14-year-old girl was hospitalized due to injuries after a glide bomb attack against the village of Zolochiv, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. As a result of a series of strikes with aerial bombs, over 20 houses, outbuildings, and two cars were damaged.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-2-injure-5-over-past-day-2/	2025-01-20T03:13:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-20-11_31_48.jpeg
Russia launched nearly 550 drones, 60 missiles, over 660 aerial bombs against Ukraine in a week, Zelensky says	Russian forces launched around 550 attack drones, nearly 60 missiles of various types, and more than 660 aerial bombs against Ukraine during the past week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Jan. 20. Russia launched a mass aerial attack against Ukraine on Jan. 15, targeting Lviv, Kharkiv, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Khmelnytskyi oblasts. On Jan. 18, Russia attacked Kyiv with missiles, killing three people, and injuring three others. Over the week, the Ukrainian military shot down 33 missiles, including ballistic missiles, and 311 attack drones, according to Zelensky. Another 136 drones used in daily attacks on infrastructure &quot;did not reach their targets,&quot; the president added. &quot;I am very grateful to all our soldiers, military aviation, anti-aircraft gunners, electronic warfare units, and mobile fire groups. But the task remains unchanged &#x2014; continue strengthening our skies&apos; protection,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;More Patriot (air defenses) for Ukraine means more protection of life. More long-range capability for Ukraine means more guarantees that the Russian war will be stopped,&quot; he added. Ukraine has lobbied international partners for more air defense capabilities in the wake of intensifying Russian strikes targeting civilian and energy infrastructure. Ukraine is also reportedly working on developing its own air defense systems, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said in an interview with the Ukrainian news outlet TSN on Jan. 19.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-nearly-550-drones-60-missiles-over-660-aerial-bombs-against-ukraine-in-a-week-zelensky-says/	2025-01-20T02:50:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/IMG_6575.jpeg
Trump instructs aides to arrange call with Putin 'in coming days' after inauguration, CNN reports	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has tasked his aides with organizing a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the days after he is sworn in, CNN reported on Jan. 19, citing undisclosed sources. Trump has previously said he wants to meet with Putin &quot;very quickly&quot; after his inauguration. The Kremlin welcomed Trump&apos;s comments, but added no preparations were currently underway for the meeting. According to CNN, Trump is willing to discuss a face-to-face meeting with Putin by phone in the coming months to try to end the war in Ukraine. Trump&apos;s national security team began preparing a phone call with Putin several weeks ago, but it is unclear whether a date has been finalized, CNN added. During the election campaign, Trump promised to end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours, though his choice for special Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, has since revised this to 100 days. The Trump team hopes to quickly begin work on a settlement plan that could be implemented within the first few months of his presidency. A meeting with Putin is part of the plan, according to CNN. Trump &quot;sees things differently,&quot; which could mean that negotiations with Putin will differ from the approach taken by the Joe Biden administration, the media outlet reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. At the same time, Trump has not spoken to Putin in almost three years. Trump has often voiced sympathies for the Russian leader while criticizing the level of support the outgoing Biden administration gave to Kyiv. This prompted concerns that the new U.S. leadership might cut a deal unfavorable to Ukraine. Kellogg said the president-elect&apos;s aim is not to &quot;give something to Putin or the Russians&quot; but to &quot;save Ukraine and save their sovereignty.&quot; Trump said that specific peace proposals are still being worked out. A pitch leaked from his team &#x2014; freezing the front lines, postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2014; has already been rejected by Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-instructs-aides-to-arrange-call-with-putin-in-coming-days-after-swearing-in-cnn-reports/	2025-01-20T01:41:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-872780694.jpg
Ukraine's Svitolina defeats Russian opponent to reach Australian Open quarterfinals	Ukrainian tennis player Elina Svitolina won her fourth match at the Australian Open on Jan. 20, defeating Russian neutral Veronika Kudermentova. Svitolina is the only Ukrainian to reach the quarterfinals in Melbourne, Australia. Prior to that, the 30-year-old defeated WTA No. 4 Jasmine Paolini, Romanian Sorana Cirstea, and American Caroline Dolehide. The match against Kudermetova lasted 1 hour and 23 minutes and ended with a score of 6-4, 6-1 in favor of the Ukrainian. Svitolina served five aces, and made three double faults. The Ukrainian tennis player also converted five out of nine break points. In the first set, Svitolina was down 1-4 but won the next five games and cruised to victory. &quot;I was just trying to fight, you know, for this fighting spirit,&quot; she said. &quot;I mean, the only thing I can do when things are not going your way, you just try to really put your head down and get back to work,&quot; she added. The Australian Open quarterfinals is a personal best for Svitolina. She also played at this stage in 2018 and 2019. &quot;That was a lifetime ago,&quot; Svitolina said during an interview after the match. &quot;You know, so many things happen &#x2014; having a daughter, Skai, then surgery as well. I&#x2019;m really pleased with the performance throughout this tournament,&quot; she added. Svitolina will face Madison Keys of the U.S., who defeated Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan, in the quarterfinals.	https://kyivindependent.com/svitolina-reaches-australian-open-quarterfinals-for-3rd-time-beating-neutral-athlete-from-russian/	2025-01-20T01:06:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194508112.jpg
Ukraine Air Force specialists safe from transfer to infantry but mobilization issues remain, Syrskyi says	Highly-trained Air Force specialists are protected from being transferred to front-line infantry units, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Jan. 19. Reports last week indicated that since 2024, thousands of Air Force soldiers have been transferred to the Ground Forces. Videos filmed by Air Force specialists themselves then surfaced, claiming their transfer to front-line units was &quot;a real challenge&quot; that could &quot;destroy the very foundation of our aviation.&quot; The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces on Jan. 14 said the transfer of some personnel is &quot;a necessary step&quot; to strengthen defense by reinforcing combat brigades with soldiers from other branches of the Armed Forces. But it stressed that Syrskyi prohibited the transfer of high-tech specialists and those trained abroad on foreign models of weapons and equipment. &quot;I have an order prohibiting the transfer of highly qualified personnel who have undergone training and specialize in aircraft maintenance,&quot; Syrskyi reiterated in an interview with journalist Andriy Tsaplienko. &quot;Clearly, these are specialists on whom money has been spent, who have gained experience, and who are practically irreplaceable,&quot; he added. But in a separate interview with Ukrainian news outlet TSN on Jan. 19, Syrskyi &#xA0;acknowledged that current mobilization efforts are not sufficient on their own to meet the needs of the armed forces. Fighting has intensified in Eastern Ukraine as Ukraine and Russia try to gain the upper hand in potential upcoming peace negotiations as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is set to be inaugurated on Jan. 20. &quot;We have needs at the front. We must increase the number of personnel in our mechanized brigades, &quot; unfortunately mobilization does not cover demand from the frontline, Syrskyi said.	https://kyivindependent.com/mobilization-currently-does-not-meet-frontline-needs-syrskyi-says/	2025-01-19T22:42:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2180021122.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 820,430 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 820,430 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 20. This number includes 1,690 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,821 tanks, 20,454 armored fighting vehicles, 34,488 vehicles and fuel tanks, 22,074 artillery systems, 1,262 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,049 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 331 helicopters, 22,768 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-820-430-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2025-01-19T22:10:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/LEM_1024.jpg
Fire, explosions reported near aviation plant, airfield in Russia's Tatarstan amid drone attack	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A fire erupted in the city of Kazan in Russia&apos;s Tatarstan republic overnight on Jan. 20 amid a Ukrainian drone attack on the city, Russian Telegram channels reported. Videos posted to social media appear to show a large fire ablaze following a drone attack. Drones appear to be shown striking targets in the region. Rosaviatsiya, the country&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency, said that Kazan International Airport has suspended flights amid the attack. Begishevo airport, located east of the city in nearby Nizhnekamsk also had its flights suspended. Preliminary reports indicate that the explosions and fire originated in the Aviastroitelny district of the city, which is the home to an aviation college and several aviation factories. Russian Telegram media channels also reported that drones appear to be targeting Borisoglebskoye airfield which houses several fuel storage tanks. The Kyiv Independent cannot immediately verify the reporting. Multiple explosions were reported in the city around 5:30 a.m. local time, various Russian Telegram media channels reported. Kazan &#x2013; lying over 900 kilometers (560 miles) east of the Ukrainian border &#x2013; is located in the Russian republic of Tatarstan, which has previously been the target of Ukrainian drone strikes. Ukraine has regularly attempted to disrupt Russia&apos;s military supply-chain through the use of drone attack. The country&apos;s forces regularly target oil refineries that contribute to Russia&apos;s war effort. Overnight on Jan. 18, Ukrainian forces attacked oil depots in Russia&apos;s Tula and Kaluga oblasts, according to the General Staff and the Kyiv Independent&apos;s source in Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR).	https://kyivindependent.com/fire-reported-flights-suspended-amid-drone-on-russias-tatarstan/	2025-01-19T19:41:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-19_23-01-15.jpg
150,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine in 2024, Syrskyi says	Russian forces suffered their heaviest losses last year since the start of the full-scale war, with total military losses reaching 434,000 soldiers, including approximately 150,000 killed in combat during 2024, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said in a Jan. 19 interview with the Ukrainian news outlet TSN. &quot;In this year of fighting, (Russian President Vladimir Putin) lost more than in the previous two years of the war (combined),&quot; Syrskyi said. As of Jan. 19, Russia has lost a total of 818,740 troops since the full-scale invasion began, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported. The estimate, which is broadly in-line with estimates made by Western intelligence agencies, likely includes those killed, captured, wounded, and missing. Russia has gained ground in eastern Ukraine and Kursk Oblast over the past year but at the cost of heavy casualties. Russian losses reached record highs in November and December, with a daily high of 2,030 troops lost in November, marking the highest daily loss since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Moscow does not disclose its casualty figures, though a Defense Ministry official recently let slip that the department received 48,000 requests to identify missing soldiers. According to a joint investigation by BBC Russia and Mediazona, journalists have identified the names of 88,726 Russian soldiers who died during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. According to the outlets&apos; conclusions for the year, 2024 will likely mark the &quot;war&apos;s deadliest year,&quot; with a current count of over 20,000 confirmed deaths over the past 12 months &#x2014; although final conclusions cannot yet be made as data on casualties continues to emerge. In December, President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed in a rare statement that Ukraine had lost 43,000 soldiers on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. When asked during the wide-ranging interview about the Ukrainian losses, Syrskyi broadly replied that there were &quot;many times&quot; less Ukrainian losses than those sustained by the Russians. At the current rate of Russian military casualties, Russian losses are expected to surpass 1 million troops within six months.	https://kyivindependent.com/150-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine-in-2024-syrskyi-says/	2025-01-19T16:31:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/5-5.jpeg
Ammunition used by Russians halved following Ukrainian strikes, Syrskyi says	Russia&apos;s ammunition use has been cut nearly in half following the impact of Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said in an interview with the Ukrainian news outlet TSN on Jan. 19. Ukraine has intensified strikes deep into Russian territory in an attempt to weaken Russia&apos;s ability to wage war in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;For several months now, the artillery ammunition expenditure rates in the Russian army have practically halved. If previously the figure reached up to 40,000 rounds per day, it is now significantly lower,&quot; Syrskyi said. Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory target &quot;industrial enterprises that produce ammunition, missile parts, or dual-use products are targeted for destruction,&quot; Syrsky said, adding that oil refineries serve as regularly military targets. Despite being regularly outgunned by Russian forces since the start of the full-scale war, Ukraine has managed to progress in arms production, with the country producing about 33-34% of its annual weapons needs &#x2014; up from less than 10% before the full-scale invasion, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 15. Europe and the U.S. supply more than 60% of Ukraine&#x2019;s weaponry, with each accounting for about 30%. Earlier in his interview, Syrskyi said that Ukraine is working on developing its own air defense systems, including ones that can repel the the Oreshnik missile. &quot;This encourages us to create our own air defense system, which would be not just an air defense system, but also an anti-missile system,&quot; Syrskyi said. &quot;The work is underway, it is being actively pursued in this direction. I hope that we will soon get the desired result for us,&quot; he added. Ukraine aims to spend a record $35 billion on weapons production in 2025, according to Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. The Ukrainian government intends to provide $17 billion, while the rest may be financed by allies.	https://kyivindependent.com/ammunition-used-by-russians-halved-syrskyi-says/	2025-01-19T15:13:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/photo_2024-02-08-22_12_44.jpeg
Zelensky, first lady visit wounded soldiers, pledge to address accessibility issues	President Volodymyr Zelensky and First Lady Olena Zelenska on Jan. 19 visited soldiers undergoing medical treatment after in Kyiv being wounded at the front and discussed issues related to mental health and disability access. The battlefield toll on Ukrainian soldiers has exacerbated mental health and accessibility challenges nationwide amid Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Zelensky met with soldiers that were injured while fighting in Pokrovsk, Kharkiv Oblast, and Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. &quot;We want to thank you for defending our country and our people, for your service across different fronts,&quot; the president said. &quot;Every front is important, and you served on the most challenging ones. You are our heroes, and we are deeply grateful to each of you.&quot; Wounded soldiers were presented with awards, including the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi. Zelensky and the first lady, alongside Veterans Affairs Minister Natalia Kalmykova, met with military medics and psychologists to discuss the steps the country has taken to combat the negative impact Russia&apos;s war has on mental well-being among Ukrainian soldiers. These include introducing operational combat stress control groups, developing psychological rehabilitation departments within hospitals, and increasing access to education in the field of psychology. Mental health support should be comprehensive and extend beyond injured soldiers, the first lady said. &quot;We need to ensure that support is comprehensive. For example, in hospitals, it should extend not only to wounded soldiers but also to their family members and the medical staff working in high-stress conditions,&quot; Zelenska said. Zelensky also highlighted the Movement Without Barriers project, an initiative piloting new wheelchair-accessible routes in 12 cities. The project is being implemented by the community and territorial development ministry as part of Zelenska&apos;s initiative.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-first-lady-visit-wounded-soldiers-in-hospital/	2025-01-19T13:39:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/zel.jpeg
Ukraine producing its own air defense systems, Syrskyi says	Ukraine is working on developing its own air defense systems, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said in an interview with the Ukrainian news outlet TSN on Jan. 19. Ukraine has lobbied international partners for more air defense capabilities in the wake of intensifying Russian strikes targeting energy infrastructure. &quot;Back in Soviet times, we actually produced all the control systems for anti-aircraft systems. That is, we have the capacities and capabilities to create, and we are working on creating, our own domestic air defense complex,&quot; Syrskyi told TSN. Ukraine&apos;s homegrown system aims to match the U.S.-made Patriot air defenses, he said. Syrskyi said that the threat posed by Russia&apos;s new intermediate-range ballistic missile, the Oreshnik, is strong motivation for Kyiv to produce its own anti-missile air defenses. Only a few air defense systems can repel the Oreshnik, Syrskyi said, and Ukraine does not yet possess these capabilities. &quot;This encourages us to create our own air defense system, which would be not just an air defense system, but also an anti-missile system,&quot; he said. &quot;This encourages us to actively negotiate with our allies to get such a system. And, of course, this should encourage us to create a modern missile system that could be a deterrent against the use of such weapons by the Russians.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed that Western air defense systems are incapable of intercepting Oreshnik missiles, even going so far as to propose a &quot;high-tech duel&quot; with the West that would involve launching the Oreshnik at Kyiv. &#xA0; The U.S. operates the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), designed to intercept intermediate-range ballistic missiles. The system has not been supplied to Ukraine and, therefore, has never been tested against the Oreshnik. Syrskyi said in the interview that work had already begun on developing Ukraine&apos;s own anti-missile system. &quot;The work is underway, it is being actively pursued in this direction. I hope that we will soon get the desired result for us,&quot; he said. &#xA0; Ukraine aims to spend a record $35 billion on weapons production in 2025, according to Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. The Ukrainian government intends to provide $17 billion, while the rest may be financed by allies. The U.K. has agreed to finance production of air defense systems and long-range weapons in Ukraine, Umerov announced on Jan. 13.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-producing-its-own-air-defense-systems-syrskyi-says/	2025-01-19T12:16:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-524224272.jpg
The Week Ahead: Key Developments Impacting Global Politics & Markets	Editor&apos;s note: This article is an on-site version of KI Insights&apos; The Week Ahead newsletter covering events from Jan. 20-Jan. 26. Sign up here to start your week with an agenda of Ukraine-related events, delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday. The global spotlight will be fixed firmly on Washington D.C. next week as Donald Trump is inaugurated as the 47th President of the United States on Jan. 20. This is perhaps the most anticipated event of the year, with allies and adversaries bracing for potential shifts in U.S. foreign policy and its impact on global power dynamics. On the same day, the 55th Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum will start in Davos, Switzerland, centered around the theme &#x201C;Collaboration for the Intelligent Age.&#x201D; The forum will run from Jan. 20 to Jan. 24 and focus on adapting economies to anticipated geopolitical shifts and technological advances, including artificial intelligence. Additionally, European MEPs will gear up for the Jan. 20-23 plenary session at the European Parliament to address the ongoing repression in Belarus and vote on a resolution condemning Russia&#x2019;s disinformation and historical distortions used to justify its war against Ukraine. On Jan. 22, the Polish PM, Donald Tusk, will present the priorities of the Polish Presidency of the Council of the European Union to the plenary of the European Parliament. The address is expected to focus on European security, emphasizing Polish strategic objectives during its tenure (Ukraine will be looking for indications of Poland&#x2019;s willingness to help fast-track its negotiation clusters and speeding up EU accession). On Jan. 22, Ukraine marks Unity Day, commemorating the 1919 unification treaty between the West Ukrainian People&#x2019;s Republic and Ukrainian People&#x2019;s Republic (the union lasted until 1921). This will be followed by a series of historical dates, culminating with the 3rd anniversary of the full-scale invasion on Feb. 24 and the war&#x2019;s entry into its 2nd decade on Feb. 27. The week will then be capped off by the Presidential &#x201C;election&#x201D; in Belarus on Jan. 26 with Alexander Lukashenko set for another five-year term. Due to the severe political repression in the country, major protests are unlikely.

Ukraine's General Staff launches investigation into 156th Brigade	Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi has directed the military to initiate an investigation into the 156th Separate Mechanized Brigade, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces announced on Jan. 19. The investigation comes on the heels of a state probe into the French-trained 155th &quot;Anne of Kyiv&quot; Mechanized Brigade. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Oleh Apostol will lead the investigation, the General Staff said in a social media post. &quot;The purpose of the work is to check the progress of the brigade&apos;s formation and provide comprehensive assistance in organizing and preparing for combat operations,&quot; the post read. Recent inspections of the 156th Brigade revealed &quot;a number of significant shortcomings,&quot; according to the military. Plans to address these problems include replacing the brigade&apos;s leadership, appointing a commander with practical combat and command experience, and transferring combat-tested officers and sergeants into the unit. Other necessary steps involve improving practical training for personnel and increasing training for drone pilots and electronic warfare operators. &quot;It should be noted that the mistakes that occurred during the formation and training of the 155th &apos;Anne of Kyiv&apos; Brigade have been taken into account, and measures are being taken to prevent them in the future,&quot; the General Staff said. The 156th Brigade is one of 14 new brigades formed by Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces in recent months. The newly formed brigades have faced front-line challenges and accusations of mismanagement &#x2014;&#xA0;particularly the 155th, the French-trained brigade at the center of a mass desertion scandal. Ground Forces Chief Mykhailo Drapatyi said on Jan. 8 that &quot;inadequate management,&quot; &quot;mistakes in recruitment,&quot; and &quot;imperfect training planning&quot; contributed to the problems with the 155th Brigade. The general&apos;s remarks followed a media investigation that claimed soldiers of the unit, deployed near the front-line hot spot Pokrovsk, suffered heavy losses and deserted in large numbers due to poor command and organization. The 155th Brigade was intended to be a flagship project for Ukrainian brigades trained and armed with the assistance of foreign partners. French President Emmanuel Macron announced in June that France would provide training and military supplies as part of this initiative.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-general-staff-launches-investigation-into-156th-brigade/	2025-01-19T11:09:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193363924.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine hits 2 oil depots in Russia overnight; Zelensky sanctions top pro-Russian politicians	Key developments on Jan. 19: Ukrainian forces attacked oil depots in Russia&apos;s Tula and Kaluga oblasts overnight on Jan. 18, according to the General Staff and the Kyiv Independent&apos;s source in Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR). The attack came amid an uptick in Ukraine&apos;s drone attacks on Russia, as Kyiv aims at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry, crucial for sustaining Moscow&apos;s war effort. The drones operated by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) hit the oil depot in Tula Oblast at least 10 times in this attack, a HUR source claimed. Tula Oblast, located south of Moscow, has regularly come under attack by Ukrainian drones. Tula Oblast Governor Dmitry Milyaev said that a fuel storage tank caught fire at &quot;one of the enterprises in the region.&quot; No casualties were reported. Videos posted on social media and shared by residents appear to show a large fire at an oil depot in the town of Uzlovaya in the region. Ukrainian soldiers also hit an oil depot in the Russian town of Lyudinovo in Kaluga Oblast overnight, causing a fire, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported. Lyudinovo lies around 200 kilometers (124 miles) north of the Ukrainian border. The oil depot is owned by Kaluganefteprodukt, a subsidiary of Russia&apos;s state-controlled oil company Rosneft, according to the statement. &quot;(This is) a logistics center that supplies units of the Russian armed forces directly involved in the war against Ukraine,&quot; the military said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree imposing new sanctions on pro-Russian politicians and propagandists, he announced on Jan. 19. &quot;We are blocking propagandists working for Russia, people who have gone over to the enemy&apos;s side, and those who help Russia continue the war,&quot; Zelensky said in a video address posted on Facebook. The decree puts into effect a decision made earlier by Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. Eighteen people were listed on the formal decree. Among them are prominent pro-Russian politicians Yuriy Boyko, Nestor Shufrych, and Yevhen Muraiev. Boyko previously led the former pro-Russian political party Opposition Platform &#x2014; For Life, which was banned by the Supreme Court following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Shufrych was arrested last year on charges of subversive activities against Ukraine and financing Russia&apos;s National Guard in occupied Crimea. According to the investigation, Shufrych paid Russia&apos;s National Guard to guard his elite real estate in Crimea, illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. Muraiev, former leader of the now-banned pro-Russian Nashi party, was charged with treason in 2023. The Security Service noted that Muraiev used his media empire, including the Nash TV channel, to disseminate pro-Russian narratives. Shortly before the start of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the U.K. Foreign Office warnedthat the Kremlin intends to install Muraiev as the head of the Russian puppet regime in Kyiv. Media reports have stated that Muraiev left Ukraine in 2022. Zelensky also noted that the country is working to deprive pro-Russian figures of state awards, specifically mentioning the Hero of Ukraine title. Last month, Ukraine&apos;s parliament voted to request that Zelensky strip the Hero of Ukraine award from Boyko. Boyko had days earlier repeated Russian propaganda talking points on social media about &quot;radicals&quot; controlling the streets in Ukraine. He was awarded the title Hero of Ukraine in 2004 during his tenure as head of Ukraine&apos;s state-owned oil and gas company Naftogaz. Twenty days into her new post as Ukraine&apos;s new military rights commissioner, Olha Reshetylova said that she had already received 3,876 appeals. In what she described as a preliminary assessment in a Facebook post about her first days on the job, Reshetylova said that lack of treatment and referrals to military medical commissions and problems moving between military units are the two leading causes for the appeals she received. More than 3,500 of the appeals have been relevant to her post and concern protecting the rights of soldiers. A portion of these concerning advice or clarification, which she referred to lawyers working &quot;almost around the clock.&quot; &quot;The rest of the appeals are substantive. Although each of them has its own individual problems, in general, of course, you can already see trends and separate blocks of problematic issues,&quot; Reshetylova wrote. While acknowledging that requests for medical treatment can be abused and that commanders face a &quot;catastrophic&quot; personnel shortage, she noted cases where commanders had denied referrals for treatment of injuries, urgent and planned operations, acute PTSD or panic attacks, and symptoms of severe concussions. Regarding military unit transfers, servicemembers were promised in November a more efficient way for transfering between units using the Army+ app. However, she wrote, &quot;very often commanders do not carry out the transfer order or specifically transfer servicemen against their will to other positions, which complicates the execution of the order.&quot; &quot;Now we&apos;re also solving these issues manually, where we have time. But it&apos;s obvious that we need to look for a systemic solution,&quot; Reshetylova wrote. Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry announced in April that it would create the new military ombudsman position to ensure soldiers had a way to report violations of their rights. Ukrainian forces launched an aerial attack against a Russian-occupied refractory plant in the embattled city of Chasiv Yar, Lieutenant Colonel Dmytro Zaporozhets, spokesperson for the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, said on Jan. 18. The attack confirms earlier reports that Ukrainian troops had withdrawn from the plant. &quot;On the territory of the refractory plant, the enemy tried to gain a foothold, attacking in small and medium groups,&quot; Zaporozhets said during a television broadcast. &quot;Thanks to coordinated actions ... (occupying Russian troops) were discovered in one of the premises on the territory of the refractory plant and an air strike was carried out. The enemy suffered losses.&quot; The Ukrainian news outlet Ukrainska Pravda posted a video, obtained from the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, depicting the strike against the plant. In the past week, Russian military bloggers alleged that Russian forces had pushed Ukrainian troops out of the refractory plant in Chasiv Yar. The crowd-sourced monitoring website Deep State also reported on Jan. 12 that Russia had occupied the site. The plant served as reliable fortification for Ukrainian forces, who must now shelter in residential buildings weakened by constant shelling. A Kyiv Metro engineer allegedly let a network of agents who helped direct Russian missile and drone attacks against the capital and Kharkiv Oblast, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced on Jan. 18. The announcement coincides with multiple reports from Ukrainian law enforcement agencies on Jan. 18 exposing alleged instances of treason and plots to aid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. The agents tracked the movement and positions of Ukrainian troops in order to coordinate Russian aerial attacks, the SBU said. Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service recruited the network leader, a Kyiv Metro engineer, during a meeting in Moscow in 2015, according to the SBU. After the full-scale invasion in 2022, he was instructed to create a network of agents who would monitor the activitiy of Ukrainian troops and cargo. The leader also personally directed Russian missile strikes on Kyiv, according to intercepted conversations. SBU officers have detained the alleged leader in Kyiv and another suspected agent in Kharkiv. During the investigation, officers seized cell phones that they said contain evidence of collaboration with Russia, along with four firearms. Both suspects have been charged with high treason in conjunction with the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. A third suspect, currently in hiding abroad, may also be charged.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-hits-2-oil-depots-in-russia-overnight-zelensky-sanctions-top-pro-russian-politicians/	2025-01-19T09:55:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1249556007.webp
As Trump prepares to take office, Kyiv awaits his team's next moves	As U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office on Jan. 20, Ukraine&apos;s fate hangs in the balance. While some potential details of Trump&apos;s future peace proposals have been leaked, the overall plan still remains unclear. Since the Nov. 5 presidential election, Trump and his team have sent mixed signals on whether their potential peace proposals will be favorable to Ukraine. Based on their public statements, Trump and his team have realized the complexity of the conflict and revised the timeline for achieving a peace deal. Previously, Trump talked about a 24-hour deadline, but now it has become a six-month timeframe. &quot;Over the past month and a half, they have realized that the contradictions between Ukraine and Russia are quite deep and complex,&quot; Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;This problem cannot be resolved quickly or with a simplistic approach. They are adjusting their approaches and deciding how to move forward.&quot; Jenny Mathers, a lecturer in international politics at the U.K.&apos;s Aberystwyth University, said that &quot;Trump wants an end to the war and he wants credit for achieving it.&quot; &quot;So we should expect plenty of drama and bold statements, perhaps backed up by bold actions,&quot; she added. &quot;But would those bold actions favor Russia or Ukraine? There are signs pointing both ways. Trump clearly admires (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and finds his statements persuasive. But Trump also wants to be seen as strong in his own right, so he might react badly to any suggestion that he is acting as Putin&apos;s pawn.&quot; President-elect Trump has nominated people with polar views on Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Tulsi Gabbard, Trump&apos;s nominee for director of national intelligence, has opposed U.S. support for Ukraine and had previously been accused of promoting Russian narratives. Peter Hegseth, Trump&apos;s pick for defense secretary, is an isolationist who has called for reducing the U.S. commitment to NATO. He backtracked his statements during confirmation hearings, saying that the U.S. won&apos;t leave the alliance and that &quot;we know who the good guy is&quot; in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Michael Waltz, who is expected to become Trump&apos;s national security advisor, and Marco Rubio, Trump&apos;s pick for secretary of state, are seen as more pro-Ukrainian and hawkish on Russia than other nominees. Keith Kellogg, Trump&apos;s nominee for special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, is also seen as more favorable to Kyiv. He has stated that Ukraine should negotiate from a position of strength. Kellogg has co-authored a peace plan that would freeze the front line in Ukraine, take Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession off the table for an extended period, and partially lift sanctions imposed on Russia. According to his proposals, the U.S. will continue sending military aid to Ukraine and provide security guarantees to Kyiv to prevent further Russian aggression. The Telegraph also reported on Nov. 7 that, under one of the peace plans being considered by Trump, he might call on British and other European troops to enforce a buffer zone that the president would attempt to establish in place of the current front line in Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer (L) and French President Emmanuel Macron (R), at the Elysee palace for a working meeting in Paris, France, on Thursday, Aug. 28, 2024 (Benjamin Girette/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Meanwhile, Rubio said on Jan. 15 that both Ukraine and Russia would have to make concessions to end the war. &quot;Any quick deal (even over six months) would likely end the fighting along the current line of control while ensuring that Ukraine has long-term protections and that Russia has financial/economic incentives to stop fighting,&quot; Michael O&apos;Hanlon, a foreign policy expert at the Brookings Institution, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Beyond that, I&apos;m not sure what the Trump team plans.&quot; As the specific details of Trump&apos;s peace plan remain unclear, its timeframe has been shifting. Trump said on Jan. 7 that peace would be achieved within six months. Kellogg said that a concrete plan needs to be established within the administration&apos;s first 100 days. Stephen Biddle, a defense policy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;the longer six-month timeline is Trump&apos;s effort to weasel out of an unrealistic promise.&quot; Thomas Graham, a distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, also said that &quot;the team has just realized that it will take more time and effort to reach a deal.&quot; &quot;The fact that (Trump) and his team have stepped back from insisting he will end the war in 24 hours to talking about a process that will take months is encouraging and in keeping with his and his team&apos;s practice of walking back some of his most flamboyant campaign promises to manage expectations among voters,&quot; Mathers said. The revised policy may also have had an impact on Trump&apos;s special envoy, Kellogg. Zelensky said on Dec. 19 that Kellogg would visit Ukraine before Trump&apos;s inauguration in January. However, Kellogg postponed his visit until after the inauguration due to U.S. restrictions on unauthorized negotiations by private citizens with foreign governments, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said on Jan. 10. &quot;Kellogg postponed his visit because they may have started to realize that the idea of ending the war in 24 hours, or even within six months, is too ambitious and complicated,&quot; Oleksandr Merezhko, head of Ukrainian parliament&apos;s foreign affairs committee, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;They are now more realistic and are slightly adjusting their strategy.&quot; Some statements made recently by Trump and his allies appear to point in the direction of a peace deal from a position of strength. &quot;I want to reach an agreement and the only way you&apos;re going to reach an agreement is not to abandon Ukraine,&quot; Trump said in an interview with the Time magazine published on Dec. 12. Kellogg said on Jan. 8 that the president-elect&apos;s aim is not to &quot;give something to Putin or the Russians&quot; but to &quot;save Ukraine and save their sovereignty.&quot; Meanwhile, the Financial Times reported on Jan. 9, citing two European officials, that U.S. assistance to Ukraine would persist following Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20. &quot;The whole (Trump) team is obsessed with strength and looking strong, so they&apos;re recalibrating the Ukraine approach,&quot; one official said. The official added that Trump&apos;s camp is cautious about avoiding comparisons with President Joe Biden&apos;s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, which they do not want to see replicated in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky pictured in Bucha, Kyiv Oblast, on March 31, 2023. (Photo: President&apos;s Office)Trump advisors are also developing a comprehensive strategy to impose sanctions on Russia to pressure it towards a peace deal, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 16, citing anonymous sources familiar with the discussions. &quot;I don&apos;t think Trump wants to appear weak relative to Putin, or to be responsible for &apos;losing Ukraine&apos; the way the Biden &apos;lost&apos; Afghanistan,&quot; Roland Paris, a professor of international affairs at the University of Ottawa, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;He wants to be seen as a peacemaker who ends, rather than starts, wars &#x2014; and that he wants to look &apos;strong&apos; in doing so.&quot; Biddle said that &quot;the only way (Trump) could end this war as quickly as he promised in his campaign is if he could get Ukraine to surrender.&quot; &quot;I doubt that Trump fancies having an outright defeat in Ukraine get labeled as &apos;Trump&apos;s Afghanistan&apos; &#x2014; not a good look for someone as obsessed with winning as he is,&quot; he added. But some of Trump&apos;s statements point in the opposite direction. He claimed on Jan. 7 that Biden&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership had led to the war. He also claimed, without any evidence, that there had been a deal that Ukraine would not join the alliance. &quot;They had a deal (not to let Ukraine into NATO), and then Biden broke it,&quot; Trump said. Mathers argued that &quot;if Putin is able to persuade (Trump) that the only path to a stable peace is by Russia getting all of its demands met, there is a real danger that Trump will agree to support that position.&quot; &quot;The experience of his first term as president suggests that he is impatient and not good at nurturing the kind of process that would be required to move from the current situation to a stable peace. This may not be good news for Ukraine,&quot; she added. Mathers also said that &quot;Trump seems more attracted by the simple solution to a problem than trying to work through complexity, such as what kind of a meaningful security guarantee for Ukraine would the U.S. be willing to support.&quot; Biddle said that &quot;to get a deal that doesn&apos;t look like a sellout, Trump will probably have to threaten a major expansion in U.S. support for Ukraine unless Putin compromises and that will be both risky and counter to the increasing anti-Ukrainian sentiment among Trump&apos;s base.&quot; &quot;So, I suspect that Trump may stall and try to change the subject rather than facing the uncomfortable choice between midwifing an embarrassing defeat and threatening an expensive and unpopular escalation,&quot; he added. But even if Trump&apos;s peace proposals favor Ukraine rather than Russia, a lot depends on Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin&apos;s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Jan. 10 that the Kremlin &quot;welcomed&quot; Trump&apos;s &quot;readiness&quot; for talks but added that plans for any face-to-face meeting would not be drawn up until after his inauguration. Trump also said on Jan. 13 that he planned to meet Putin &quot;very quickly,&quot; adding that the Russian leader &quot;wants to meet&quot; as well. &quot;I actually find the prospect of a face to face meeting between the two men very alarming, especially if no other comparable political figures are present,&quot; Mathers told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We know that Trump admires Putin as the archetype of the strong man leader that Trump himself aspires to be.&quot; U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin during a news conference in Helsinki, Finland, on July 16, 2018. (Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images)She added that, after a meeting between Putin and Trump at the 2018 Helsinki summit, &quot;Trump emerged looking beaten down and Putin was full of smiles.&quot; &quot;Everything Trump said at the press conference immediately afterward suggested that Putin got whatever he asked for, or at least persuaded Trump to echo Russian talking points in public,&quot; she added. The Helsinki meeting, conducted on the backdrop of the revelations that Russia had meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, had drawn criticism from both Republicans and Democrats. Russia has so far refused to agree to any compromise. Putin said in June 2024 that Moscow would only agree to a ceasefire and enter peace talks if Ukrainian troops withdraw from Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts. Ukraine maintains control of the regional capitals of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, holds a substantial part of Donetsk Oblast, and maintains a foothold in Luhansk Oblast. The Kremlin&apos;s other demands include the lifting of Western sanctions against Russia, Ukraine&apos;s refusal to join NATO, &quot;demilitarization&quot; &#x2014; most likely implying the decrease in the number of Ukrainian military personnel &#x2014; and &quot;denazification&quot; &#x2014; a likely reference to restrictions on nationalist parties and giving Russia an ability to bolster pro-Russian parties in the country. Meanwhile, Zelensky signed a decree on Jan. 19, imposing new sanctions on the country&apos;s pro-Russian politicians and propagandists. &quot;We are blocking propagandists working for Russia, people who have gone over to the enemy&apos;s side, and those who help Russia continue the war,&quot; Zelensky said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Dec. 29 that the Kremlin was dissatisfied with the reported peace proposals on Ukraine from Trump&apos;s team. Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) chairs a meeting regarding the situation in the Kursk region, in his residence in Novo-Ogaryovo outside Moscow, Russia on Aug. 12, 2024. (Gavriil Grigorov/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)&quot;Experts... tend to concur that Russia will not begin to face extremely tough constraints on its war effort during 2025, certainly not over the six months we&apos;re talking about,&quot; William Wohlforth, a professor focusing on international relations at Dartmouth College, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Hence, most do not expect Putin to be in the mood to make any kind of reasonable concessions.&quot; He said, &quot;The real question is, what does the Trump administration do when it discovers this?&quot; &quot;I&apos;m sure Trump really does want a deal, and I&apos;m sure he&apos;s prepared to use U.S. aid conditionality as a lever with Kyiv to get one,&quot; Biddle said. &quot;The problem here is Putin, who seems unlikely to accept anything that isn&apos;t actually tantamount to a Ukrainian surrender.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s position appears to be the opposite of Russia&apos;s demands. Zelensky&apos;s peace formula envisages punishing those responsible for war crimes, withdrawing all Russian troops from the territory of Ukraine, restoration of Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity, and the release of all prisoners of war and deportees. Mathers said that &quot;the most difficult element to resolve will be providing Ukraine with meaningful security guarantees, and without this in place, I assume that Kyiv would be very reluctant to agree to a peace deal.&quot; &quot;It is also important to remember that Ukraine will have a voice in this process,&quot; Graham said. &quot;There will be no deal without Kyiv&apos;s approval. While Washington might have leverage over Kyiv, it lacks the ability &#x2014; and I would imagine the will&#x2014; to impose a deal on Kyiv. What is (Ukraine) prepared to concede in order to achieve a lasting peace?	https://kyivindependent.com/as-trump-prepares-to-take-office-kyiv-awaits-his-teams-next-moves/	2025-01-19T09:36:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194069797.jpg
Fico accuses Slovak opposition leader of 'kissing Zelensky's ring'	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico accused opposition leader Michal Simecka of &quot;kissing Zelensky&apos;s ring&quot; during his recent visit to Kyiv and said the MP wanted to stage a coup d&apos;etat in Bratislava. Simecka, the pro-Western leader of the Progressive Slovakia party, headed a delegation of Slovak opposition MPs on a visit to Kyiv Jan. 17. The aim of the visit was to &quot;reopen the door that Robert Fico slammed with his aggressive outbursts,&quot; Simecka said. In an address posted to Facebook late on Jan. 18, Fico said the delegates were &quot;kissing (President Volodymyr) Zelensky&apos;s ring&quot; and &quot;promising him support for Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO.&quot; Fico said the opposition wanted to stage a coup and alluded to Ukraine&apos;s EuroMaidan revolution in his accusation. &quot;We are preparing for all possible alternatives,&quot; he said. &quot;We will be ready for everything. Especially for Maidan, that is, a coup d&apos;etat across the street, which the opposition, especially Progressive Slovakia, is so tenaciously trying to achieve.&quot; Fico, a pro-Russian politician who has long opposed military aid to Ukraine, has escalated threats against Kyiv following the termination of Russian gas transit via Ukrainian territory on Jan. 1. &#xA0;He has threatened to limit aid to Ukrainians and cut off electricity supplies amid an energy crisis brought on by Russia&apos;s relentless attacks against Ukraine&apos;s power grid. As tensions mount, Zelensky and Fico have signaled they may hold talks in the coming days. Fico told reporters on Jan. 16 that he might meet with Zelensky at an unspecified location in the &quot;next few days.&quot; Zelensky on Jan. 17 invited Fico to visit Kyiv. &#xA0; In his address, Fico showed no signs of softening his rhetoric against Ukraine. &quot;Robert Fico is the Slovak Prime Minister, not a Ukrainian servant,&quot; he said. The prime minister said he would likely veto future financial aid to Ukraine from the European Union and reiterated his opposition to Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership. &quot;The government I lead will never support Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO, because it would only lead to World War III,&quot; Fico said. &quot;The government will also never propose sending soldiers to Ukraine to turn their weapons against the Russian Federation.&quot; Fico&apos;s friendliness towards the Kremlin has sparked outrage both at home and abroad. His meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow in December drew condemnation from other European leaders. Mass protests erupted in Bratislava in early January, with thousands chanting &quot;We are not Russia.&quot; A coalition of Slovak opposition parties announced on Jan. 14 that they planned to initiate a vote of no confidence in Fico&apos;s government.	https://kyivindependent.com/fico-accuses-slovak-opposition-leader-of-kissing-zelenskys-ring/	2025-01-19T09:01:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1957977106.jpg
Syria bans goods from Russia, Iran, Israel	Syria&apos;s new administration has banned all Russian, Iranian, and Israeli goods from entering the country in a new decree issued by the country&apos;s finance minister on Jan. 17. Any relevant goods discovered at land and sea border crossings will be confiscated, according to the ban, reported regional media outlets. The decision came shortly after the country had restricted entry of Iranian and Israeli passport holders. Ukraine has moved quickly to restore ties with Syria after rebels overthrew the Russia-backed regime of former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad on Dec. 8. Last month, Ukraine&apos;s foreign minister Andrii Sybiha visited Syria, marking the first official Ukrainian delegation to Syria in years. During the trip, he said he hoped to increase trade with Syria. As the new Syrian government looks to establish itself and reset foreign relations with its former partners and adversaries, the trade ban may exacerbate tensions in the region and impact trade.	https://kyivindependent.com/syria-bans-goods-from-russia-iran-and-israel/	2025-01-19T07:53:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188252219.jpg
Lack of medical treatment, problems with unit transfers are most common causes of appeals, new military ombudsman says	Twenty days into her new post as Ukraine&apos;s new military rights commissioner, Olha Reshetylova said that she had already received 3,876 appeals. In what she described as a preliminary assessment in a Facebook post about her first days on the job, Reshetylova said that lack of treatment and referrals to military medical commissions and problems moving between military units are the two leading causes for the appeals she received. &#xA0; More than 3,500 of the appeals have been relevant to her post and concern protecting the rights of soldiers. A portion of these concerning advice or clarification, which she referred to lawyers working &quot;almost around the clock.&quot; &quot;The rest of the appeals are substantive. Although each of them has its own individual problems, in general, of course, you can already see trends and separate blocks of problematic issues,&quot; Reshetylova wrote. While acknowledging that requests for medical treatment can be abused and that commanders face a &quot;catastrophic&quot; personnel shortage, she noted cases where commanders had denied referrals for treatment of injuries, urgent and planned operations, acute PTSD or panic attacks, and symptoms of severe concussions. In one appeal that she cited, a serviceman with HIV voluntarily mobilized at the start of the war, but has since developed bleeding ulcers and faces worsening health effects. The soldier received a referral for surgery but was threatened with a desertion complaint if he left. While Reshetylova said she is personally calling commanders in some cases to address the issues, &quot;attention to the health of a serviceman should become a priority for both military doctors, unit commanders, and the entire system as a whole,&quot; she said. &quot;It is not difficult to understand that in such a state the effectiveness of performing combat missions is low, and the mortality rate among servicemen due to diseases will grow. In addition, in the case of untreated mental disorder, a serviceman can pose a danger either to himself or to his comrades,&quot; Reshetylova wrote. Regarding military unit transfers, servicemembers were promised in November a more efficient way for transfering between units using the Army+ app. However, she wrote, &quot;very often commanders do not carry out the transfer order or specifically transfer servicemen against their will to other positions, which complicates the execution of the order.&quot; &quot;Now we&#x2019;re also solving these issues manually, where we have time. But it&#x2019;s obvious that we need to look for a systemic solution,&quot; Reshetylova wrote. The third largest category of appeals comprised of questions from relatives of prisoners of war missing soldiers, according to Reshetylova. &#xA0; Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry announced in April that it would create the new military ombudsman position to ensure soldiers had a way to report violations of their rights.

Zelensky imposes new sanctions on pro-Russian propagandists	President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree imposing new sanctions on pro-Russian propagandists, he announced on Jan. 19. &quot;We are blocking propagandists working for Russia, people who have gone over to the enemy&apos;s side, and those who help Russia continue the war,&quot; Zelensky said in a video address posted on Facebook. The decree puts into effect a decision made earlier by Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. He also noted that the country is working to deprive them of state awards, specifically mentioning the Hero of Ukraine title. Last month, Ukraine&apos;s parliament voted to request that Zelensky to strip the Hero of Ukraine award from parliamentary member Yuriy Boyko. Boyko had days earlier repeated Russian propaganda talking points on social media about &quot;radicals&quot; controlling the streets in Ukraine. Boyko previously led the former pro-Russian political party Opposition Platform &#x2014; For Life, which was banned by the Supreme Court following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. He was awarded the title Hero of Ukraine in 2004 during his tenure as head of Ukraine&apos;s state-owned oil and gas company Naftogaz. &quot;There are still many names in the request for the revocation of awards,&quot; lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said after the parliamentary vote.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-imposes-new-sanctions-on-pro-russian-propagandists/	2025-01-19T05:28:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156503093.jpg

Officials believe Baltic Sea cable damage caused by accidents, not Russian sabotage, WP reports	Amid a series of incidents that have damaged critical cables in the Baltic Sea, intelligence services in the U.S. and Europe are increasingly convinced that they were caused by accidents, according to a report by the Washington Post on Jan. 19. The incidents had raised fears that Russian shadow fleet vessels were intentionally sabotaging the energy and communication lines. As a result, NATO dispatched additional patrol ships to the area earlier this month. The Washington Post report cited senior officials from three countries involved in investigating the cause of the incidents, who said they found no evidence that the ships suspected of dragging anchors across the cables were directed by Moscow or that they damaged the cables intentionally. The officials instead noted that intercepted communications and classified intelligence pointed to maritime accidents as the likely cause. Russia, NATO countries, and the Baltic Sea Region. (Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)The events had heightened tension between Russia and Europe, as Russian activities have been linked to intensifying hybrid warfare attacks across the continent, including cyberattacks, espionage, and election interference. Earlier this week, the New York Times reported that U.S. officials warned Russian President Vladimir Putin not to carry out plan plans to smuggle incendiary devices onto U.S.-bound cargo planes. Intelligence sources suspect Russia was behind similar cases last summer when packages mailed by individuals caught fire in warehouses in Germany and the U.K.	https://kyivindependent.com/officials-increasingly-believe-baltic-sea-cable-damage-caused-by-accidents-not-russian-sabotage-washington-post-reports/	2025-01-19T04:04:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1258782719.jpg
Ukraine downs 43 Russian drones overnight, Air Force reports	Ukrainian forces shot down 43 Russian attack drones overnight, the Air Force reported on the morning of Jan. 19. Russia launched Shahed-type drones and decoy drones from bases in Millerovo, Oryol, and Bryansk, according to the report. The Air Force said it also lost track of 15 decoy drones Russia launched alongside the attack drones, saying that this resulted in no negative effects. The drones were shot down over Poltava, Sumy, Kharkiv, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Dnipropetrovsk and Mykolaiv oblasts. Russian drone attacks on Ukraine jumped to record levels at the end of 2024, with Moscow planning to ramp up its production or UAVs in 2025.

Merkel highlights NATO's role in supporting Ukraine, urges transatlantic unity, media reports	Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel has emphasized the critical role of the United States and NATO in ensuring Ukraine&apos;s independence amid Russia&apos;s invasion. Speaking at the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU&apos;s New Year&apos;s reception in D&#xFC;sseldorf, Merkel said that the transatlantic partnership is more essential now than ever, underscoring its importance as Donald Trump prepared to take office as U.S. president. &quot;The attack by Russian President Vladimir Putin has shattered the principle of territorial integrity that underpinned Europe&#x2019;s post-war order,&quot; Merkel said, according to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. She argued that only through a united NATO effort, with strong U.S. leadership, can Putin&apos;s ambitions be thwarted and Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty preserved. Merkel described Trump as a &quot;unique president&quot; who focuses on defending U.S. interests but views international cooperation as a zero-sum game. Unlike multilateral approaches that seek mutual benefit, Trump operates on the belief that every negotiation produces a winner and a loser, she said. While acknowledging that Trump&#x2019;s outlook cannot be changed, Merkel urged Europe to consolidate its own interests and remain a steadfast partner to the U.S. &quot;Europe is our life insurance,&quot; she said, highlighting the continent&#x2019;s strategic value in global alliances. Merkel also took aim at the challenges facing Germany&#x2019;s current government and expressed her support for Friedrich Merz, the CDU leader, to take the chancellorship after the upcoming federal election on Feb. 23. Germany has become Ukraine&#x2019;s second-largest military donor after the U.S., though Chancellor Olaf Scholz has faced criticism for his cautious stance on key issues, including his refusal to supply Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/merkel-highlights-natos-role-in-supporting-ukraine-urges-transatlantic-unity-media-reports/	2025-01-18T21:55:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2154776902.jpg
Russia condemns 100-year partnership agreement between Ukraine and UK	Russia criticized a newly announced 100-year partnership agreement between Ukraine and the U.K., rejecting any cooperation between the two nations in the Azov Sea. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Jan. 18 declared such claims to the region a &quot;gross interference&quot; in Russia&#x2019;s affairs, claiming they would face firm resistance. The Kremlin expressed concern on Jan. 17 over potential deployment of British military assets in Ukraine under the agreement, particularly in the Azov Sea. Russia views the sea as part of its territory, citing its proximity to Russian borders, areas of southern Ukraine under Russian occupation, and Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014. Zakharova dismissed the agreement as meaningless from Russia&#x2019;s perspective, calling it a &quot;PR campaign&quot; by Kyiv. She added that Moscow considers the Sea of Azov an &quot;internal sea.&quot; The partnership, announced on Jan. 16 during British Prime Minister Keir Starmer&#x2019;s visit to Kyiv, includes commitments to strengthen military cooperation in the Baltic Sea, Black Sea, and Sea of Azov. Starmer pledged to support Ukraine with robust security guarantees if negotiations for a ceasefire with Russia move forward. The agreement marked Starmer&#x2019;s first visit to Ukraine as prime minister and highlighted the U.K.&apos;s continued support for President Volodymyr Zelensky. Starmer described the long-term partnership as a commitment to Ukraine&#x2019;s security and sovereignty. Russia&#x2019;s objections underline ongoing tensions over control of the Azov Sea, a strategic waterway central to both economic and military interests in the region. Moscow&#x2019;s position signals potential challenges to Ukraine and U.K.&#x2019;s efforts to enhance cooperation in contested areas.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-condemns-100-year-partnership-agreement-between-ukraine-and-uk/	2025-01-18T21:01:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/213eb4fab6527c39e0ce5fa008b4f0b8_1737025391_extra_large.jpeg
Trump eyes China visit amid strained ties, WSJ reports	President-elect Donald Trump has expressed interest in visiting China shortly after assuming office, potentially within his first 100 days, sources familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal. This potential trip would aim to stabilize relations with Beijing, strained by Trump&#x2019;s pledge to impose steep tariffs on Chinese imports. While Trump&#x2019;s transition team has not commented, advisers have also discussed the possibility of inviting Chinese President Xi Jinping to the United States to jump-start dialogue on critical issues. A possible meeting with Xi could come during a pivotal moment for U.S.-China relations, as both leaders navigate fraught economic and geopolitical challenges, including the war in Ukraine, trade disputes, and Taiwan&#x2019;s status. Trump and Xi spoke by phone on Jan. 17 for the first time since the November election, addressing various topics including trade, the fentanyl crisis, and the social media platform TikTok. Trump shared his optimism about their collaboration, sharing on social media that he expects the two nations will &quot;solve many problems together, starting immediately.&quot; During the conversation, however, Xi underscored the importance of handling Taiwan prudently, emphasizing its significance to China&apos;s sovereignty, according to the Wall Street Journal Beijing&#x2019;s official account of the call highlighted plans to establish a strategic communication channel between the two leaders. Trump reportedly conveyed his eagerness to meet Xi in person, though it remains unclear if a potential visit to China was explicitly discussed. Xi declined an invitation to Trump&#x2019;s inauguration, opting instead to send Vice President Han Zheng, a figure seen as a pragmatist in Washington and a signal of Beijing&#x2019;s openness to future negotiations. China&#x2019;s role in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine looms large in the broader U.S.-China dynamic. Beijing has provided indirect support to Moscow, drawing criticism from American lawmakers. While Trump did not reference the war in his post-call remarks, he suggested a desire to work with Xi to promote global stability, saying: &quot;President Xi and I will do everything possible to make the World more peaceful and safe!&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-eyes-china-visit-amid-strained-ties-wsj-reports/	2025-01-18T19:25:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179841418.jpg
Russia's Jan. 18 attack damages Ukraine's oldest McDonald’s in Kyiv	A Russian missile strike on Kyiv early on Jan. 18 damaged Ukraine&apos;s oldest McDonald&#x2019;s, located near the Lukianivska metro station in the city&apos;s Shevchenkivskyi district. Open since 1997, this is the first McDonald&apos;s restaurant in the country. McDonald&#x2019;s Ukraine confirmed the damage in a statement: &quot;Today, during an aerial attack on Kyiv, a McDonald&#x2019;s restaurant near the Lukianivska metro station was damaged. Our staff were able to evacuate to a shelter in time thanks to our safety protocols.&quot; The restaurant is currently closed but the company pledged to repair the damages. Kyiv remains a frequent target of Russian attacks since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. The missile attack caused significant destruction in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv. Three people&#x2014;a 41-year-old woman and two men aged 25 and 43&#x2014;were killed, and three others sustained injuries, according to Kyiv City Military Administration head Tymur Tkachenko.

The glass entrance to the Lukianivska metro station was also damaged in the attack. Several cars caught fire, and a water pipeline was damaged.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-jan-18-attack-damages-ukraines-oldest-mcdonalds-in-kyiv/	2025-01-18T15:45:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193884529-2.jpg
Germany may consider sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, defense minister says	Germany may consider deploying its troops in a peacekeeping mission to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said on January 18. The idea of sending a European peacekeeping force to Ukraine has gained traction in recent months as EU countries prepare to play a greater role in Kyiv&apos;s defense once U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. When asked if Germany was prepared to deploy troops to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire agreement, Pistorius indicated that Berlin was open to the idea. &quot;We&apos;re the largest NATO partner in Europe. We&apos;ll obviously have a role to play,&quot; Pistorius said in an interview with the German media outlet Suddeutsche Zeitung. The matter will &quot;be discussed in due time,&quot; Pistorius said. The U.K. and France are reportedly already discussing the possibility of deploying French and British troops to monitor a ceasefire along the front line in Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Jan. 16 that he had discussed the option with President Volodymyr Zelensky during their meeting in Kyiv. French President Emmanuel Macron, who first floated the idea of European troops in Ukraine, has also been in talks with Zelensky regarding future peacekeepers. Zelensky has previously said that Ukraine would only consider foreign peacekeepers if it secures a clear timeline for NATO membership. Other German politicians have also commented on the issue of deploying Bundeswehr troops to Ukraine. Roderich Kiesewetter, a lawmaker from the opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said on Jan. 3 that Berlin should not rule out the possibility. Friedrich Merz, the opposition CDU/CSU alliance&apos;s candidate for chancellor in the upcoming parliamentary elections, said on Dec. 28 that Germany could join a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine but only with Russia&apos;s consent.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-may-consider-sending-peacekeeping-troops-to-ukraine-defense-minister-says/	2025-01-18T13:51:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193104154.jpg
Students who fail military exam or refuse oath cannot continue higher ed, official says	Ukrainian university students who fail the basic military training exam or refuse to swear the military oath will not be permitted to continue their studies, Deputy Defense Minister Serhii Melnyk said on Jan. 18. Melnyk&apos;s comments follow the Defense Ministry&apos;s announcement on Jan. 17 that basic military training for students enrolled in higher education institutions will begin in September 2025. &quot;I would like to emphasize that (basic military training) is mandatory for everyone,&quot; Melnyk said. &quot;And if students cannot pass the exam for some reason or pass it unsatisfactorily, if they refuse to take the military oath, they will not be able to study in higher education institutions in the future.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky approved an updated version of the law on military service in Ukraine that stipulates systematic basic military training for students. The course will consist of 90 academic hours of theoretical study and 210 academic hours of practical training. The theoretical portion is compulsory for both men and women, ages 18 to 25. The practical course is mandatory only for men. Following completion of the training course, students will take the military oath, receive a certificate, and obtain a military specialization. The law reflects the changes Ukraine&apos;s educational institutions have undergone since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The Ukrainian goverment has amended enrollment policies to curb draft evasion and launched drone education programs. Starting in 2024, Ukrainian schools also launched a pilot program updating the Defense of Ukraine subject, which has been taught since the Soviet era. The updated subject will become mandatory in 2027.	https://kyivindependent.com/students-who-fail-military-exam-or-refuse-oath-cannot-continue-studies-official-says/	2025-01-18T13:05:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/melnyk.png
Ukrainian troops withdraw from, launch attack on Chasiv Yar refractory plant	Ukrainian forces launched an aerial attack against a Russian-occupied refractory plant in the embattled city of Chasiv Yar, Lieutenant Colonel Dmytro Zaporozhets, spokesperson for the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, said on Jan. 18. The attack confirms earlier reports that Ukrainian troops had withdrawn from the plant. &quot;On the territory of the refractory plant, the enemy tried to gain a foothold, attacking in small and medium groups,&quot; Zaporozhets said during a television broadcast. &quot;Thanks to coordinated actions ... (occupying Russian troops) were discovered in one of the premises on the territory of the refractory plant and an air strike was carried out. The enemy suffered losses.&quot; The Ukrainian news outlet Ukrainska Pravda posted a video, obtained from the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, depicting the strike against the plant. In the past week, Russian military bloggers alleged that Russian forces had pushed Ukrainian troops out of the refractory plant in Chasiv Yar. The crowd-sourced monitoring website Deep State also reported on Jan. 12 that Russia had occupied the site. The plant served as reliable fortification for Ukrainian forces, who must now shelter in residential buildings weakened by constant shelling. The front-line city of Chasiv Yar has become one of the hottest spots in Donetsk Oblast in recent months as Russian troops continue advancing in eastern Ukraine. The city has been partially under Russian control since Ukrainian forces withdrew from the eastern Kanal neighborhood in July. Fighting has recently intensified near the city, with Russian forces reportedly using armored combat vehicles in their assault for the first time in late December.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-troops-withdraw-from-launch-attack-on-chasiv-yar-refractory-plant-military-says/	2025-01-18T12:15:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1607100920.jpg
Dnipropetrovsk firm helped Russia build nuclear weapons labs, SBU says	A building materials company in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast sent metal products to the Russian Federation that were used to build nuclear weapons laboratories, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on Jan. 18, following an investigation into the firm. The announcement coincides with multiple reports from Ukrainian law enforcement agencies on Jan. 18 exposing alleged instances of treason and plots to aid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Representatives of the company allegedly shipped a large-scale batch of stainless steel profiles to Russia after the full-scale invasion in 2022, the SBU said. These products were used to outfit the Russian Institute for Nuclear Research. In these labs, &quot;the Russians are developing designs for new models of nuclear-powered missile weapons,&quot; the SBU said. To conceal the shipment to Russia, dealers first sent the materials to a third-party company in the Middle East, according to the investigation. From there, the goods were exported to Russia. Investigators said they uncovered evidence of criminal activity in mobile phones, computer equipment, and documents seized during searches of the company and of suspects&apos; apartments. The owner of the company and three subordinates have been charged with providing assistance to an aggressor state. The suspects face a sentence of up to 12 years in prison with confiscation of property if convicted.	https://kyivindependent.com/dnipropetrovsk-firm-helped-russia-build-nuclear-weapons-labs-sbu-says/	2025-01-18T11:10:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/SBU2.jpg
SBU detains metro engineer who allegedly directed Russian missile strikes on Kyiv, Kharkiv	A Kyiv Metro engineer allegedly let a network of agents who helped direct Russian missile and drone attacks against the capital and Kharkiv Oblast, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced on Jan. 18. The agents tracked the movement and positions of Ukrainian troops in order to coordinate Russian aerial attacks, the SBU said. Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service recruited the network leader, a Kyiv Metro engineer, during a meeting in Moscow in 2015, according to the SBU. After the full-scale invasion in 2022, he was instructed to create a network of agents who would monitor the activitiy of Ukrainian troops and cargo. The engineer allegedly recruited acquaintances into the network, including a Kharkiv resident who deserted the Ukrainian military and previously worked for Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia) for 10 years. This agent tracked and reported on the movements of Ukraine&apos;s military. Another agent, an international road transport driver, identified and shared the coordinates of military checkpoints. The ringleader then passed this intelligence on to the FSB, the SBU claimed. The leader also personally directed Russian missile strikes on Kyiv, according to intercepted conversations. SBU officers have detained the alleged leader in Kyiv and another suspected agent in Kharkiv. During the investigation, officers seized cell phones that they said contain evidence of collaboration with Russia, along with four firearms. Both suspects have been charged with high treason in conjunction with the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. A third suspect, currently in hiding abroad, may also be charged. The suspects face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, along with confiscation of property.	https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-detains-metro-engineer-who-allegedly-directed-russian-missile-strikes-on-kyiv-kharkiv/	2025-01-18T10:11:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/sbuykyiv.jpeg
Russia used chemical weapons 434 times in December, Ukraine's General Staff says	Russian forces used chemical weapons on the battlefield 434 times in December 2024, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 18. Since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine&apos;s radiation, chemical, and biological intelligence units have been monitoring and recording the use of hazardous chemicals in attacks. The military has recorded 5,389 cases since February 2023. Russian forces used K-51 and RG-VO munitions, anti-riot weapons that are prohibited for use in warfare, the General Staff said in their report. Russia has also used ammunition loaded with dangerous chemicals of &quot;unspecified type.&quot; The use of such weapons &quot;grossly violates the rules of warfare,&quot; the General Staff said. The report noted that chemical weapons attacks have &quot;become systemic&quot; since February 2023. Russia has been intensifying its use of chemical agents on the battlefield in Ukraine. A Kyiv Independent investigation from August 2024 showed that instances of gas attacks are rising, and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) confirmed on Nov. 18 that a riot control agent known as CS has been used in Ukraine. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, more than 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been hospitalized with chemical poisoning, and three have died, Ukrainian Colonel Artem Vlasiuk said on Dec. 13. Ukraine struck back at Russia&apos;s use of illegal chemical weapons on Dec. 17, when the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) assassinated Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian Armed Forces&apos; radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops. The previous day, Ukrainain prosecutors charged Kirillov in absentia for the use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-used-chemical-weapons-434-times-in-december-ukraines-general-staff-says/	2025-01-18T09:20:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2121052659.jpg
Direct threat' — Ukraine's 48th Separate Assault Battalion denounces commander replacement	Soldiers of Ukraine&apos;s 48th Separate Assault Battalion spoke out against the replacement of their commander Lenur Islyamov in a video address to Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi published on Jan. 18. The battalion is currently based in the town of Pokrovsk, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian forces that has been the focus of fierce fighting as Russia intensifies its offensive in Donetsk Oblast. According to the soldiers, they were deployed there 10 days ago after almost a year spent defending another hot spot in the region. &#xA0;Following the redeployment, the battalion learned that Isyamov had been replaced by another commander. &quot;Changing the commander at a critical moment is a direct threat to the unit&apos;s combat capability and undermines the trust of the fighters,&quot; the statement read. The servicemembers praised Islyamov for forming and leading a battalion that consists of 90% volunteers. &quot;We have not surrendered a single position. Instead, we have conducted dozens of successful operations. During this time, we recaptured several settlements where Ukrainian flags were planted,&quot; one soldier said. &quot;All this was possible only thanks to the experience, professionalism, and dedication of our commander.&quot; The soldiers also said that they were not provided with necessary intelligence information after their redeployment. The Ukrainian military leadership has not yet commented on the address. This is the latest appeal by the Ukrainian military in support of a commander allegedly about to be removed. In the summer of 2024, soldiers from Ukraine&apos;s 24th Mechanized Brigade spoke out to oppose the dismissal of its commander, Ivan Holishevskyi. Later, officers from Ukraine&apos;s 80th Air Assault Brigade called on Ukraine&apos;s political and military leadership to keep brigade commander Emil Ishkulov in his post.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-48th-assault-battalion-denounces-commander-replacement/	2025-01-18T08:16:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/--------------2025-01-18-174743.png
Lukashenko frees 23 more Belarusian political prisoners	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko freed 23 Belarusians convicted of &quot;extremist crimes,&quot; his press office reported on Jan. 18. Lukashenko has pardoned political prisoners in rounds since July, a move that many see as an attempt to boost his approval rating ahead of the 2025 presidential election. However, political persecution continues in Belarus, according to human rights activists. The eighth round of &quot;pardons&quot; includes three women and 20 men. More than half of them are over 50 years old. Fourteen people have chronic diseases, according to the statement. The names of the released convicts have not been revealed. Since the first round of pardons on July 3, timed to coincide with Independence Day in Belarus, over 200 political prisoners have been reportedly released. Nearly 1,300 prisoners remain behind bars in Belarus, Viasna Human Rights Center reported. However, the Lukashenko regime is continuing its crackdown on dissent. In fact, arbitrary repression of political opponents has intensified in Belarus in the run-up to the 2025 presidential elections, the Viasna said. Over November and December, human rights activists added 120 new names to the list of recognized political prisoners in Belarus. Lukashenko has been in power since 1994 and is looking to reelect himself for the seventh time.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-frees-23-more-political-prisoners-in-belarus/	2025-01-18T06:55:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1257107756.jpg
Ex-MP, leader of Russia-affiliated Ukrainian Orthodox Church charged with treason	Ukrainian law enforcement officers charged former lawmaker and businessman Vadym Novynskyi with high treason and incitement to religious hatred in absentia, the State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) said. The SBI didn&apos;t mention the suspect&apos;s name, but the description and the video made it clear that this was Novynskyi. Novynskyi is an ex-lawmaker from the pro-Russian Opposition Bloc, which was banned in Ukraine shortly after the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale war, and sponsor of the Moscow-backed church in Ukraine. For years, Novynskyi was listed among the richest Ukrainians, with Forbes estimating his wealth at $1.4 billion in the spring of 2023. According to the investigation, Novynskyi has been publicly promoting Russian narratives since Moscow&apos;s invasion in 2014. &quot;The MP tried to form anti-government and pro-Russian sentiments in Ukrainian society, justify Russian aggression, etc.,&quot; the SBI said. Law enforcement officials called Novynskyi a &quot;handler&quot; of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) in Ukraine. In December 2022, Ukraine imposed sanctions against him and other leaders of the Russia-affiliated Ukrainian Orthodox Church. The former MP followed the instructions of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, maintained close ties with him for a long time, and was hierarchically subordinate to him, the statement read. After the start of the full-scale invasion, Novynskyi resigned from Ukraine&apos;s parliament and fled abroad. He continues &quot;to assist Russia in conducting subversive information activities,&quot; the SBI said. If detained and convicted, he might face up to 15 years in prison with or without confiscation of property.	https://kyivindependent.com/ex-mp-leader-of-russia-affiliated-ukrainian-orthodox-church-charged-with-treason/	2025-01-18T05:47:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-628589626.jpg
Former pro-Russian lawmaker charged with treason resurfaces in China	Former Ukrainian pro-Russian lawmaker Yevheniy Murayev published a two-hour propaganda interview on Jan. 17, marking his first public appearance after almost three years of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Murayev was a lawmaker between 2012 and 2019, and later led the pro-Russian Nashi party until it was banned in June 2022. He also was the owner of Nash TV channel, which was banned in 2022 for spreading the Kremlin&apos;s propaganda. Murayev fled Ukraine in May 2022. He said in the interview that he lived in Beijing with his family. He refused to say how he managed to leave Ukraine. In the interview, Murayev parroted Russian propaganda, blaming President Volodymyr Zelensky for Russia&apos;s all-out invasion. The ex-lawmaker opposed Ukraine&apos;s EU and NATO accession and criticized Western sanctions imposed on Moscow. He said that his reappearance is not related to the post-war elections, which have been the subject of speculations in Ukraine in recent months. &quot;I&apos;m not running for any position, and I don&apos;t see any possibility of returning to Ukraine yet. At least in the short term,&quot; Murayev said. Shortly before the start of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the U.K. Foreign Office warned that the Kremlin intends to install Murayev as the head of the Russian puppet regime in Kyiv. A day after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Murayev called on Kyiv to capitulate. In the summer of 2023, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) charged Murayev with high treason.	https://kyivindependent.com/pro-russian-politician-charged-with-treason-resurfaces-in-china/	2025-01-18T04:34:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1151714517.jpg
24-year-old Belarusian volunteer soldier killed in action near Bakhmut	Maria Zaitseva, a 24-year-old Belarusian volunteer soldier fighting for Ukraine, was killed in action near the town of Bakhmut in Donetsk Oblast on Jan. 17, Nasha Niva reported. Zaitseva joined the Ukrainian army after the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale war and fought with the 2nd International Legion Battalion. She turned 24 on Jan. 16, a day before she was killed by Russian forces. In August 2020, Zaitseva participated in the protests in Minsk against alleged presidential election fraud in Belarus. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko claimed to have won elections by a landslide with 80% of the vote, provoking nationwide protests and a subsequent regime crackdown on dissent. During protests, fragments of a flash grenade severely injured Zaitseva&apos;s arm and head. Her photo from the protests with her face covered in blood went viral. &quot;Gravely injured during the 2020 Belarus protests, she gave her life for freedom,&quot; said Belarusian opposition leader Svitlana Tsikhanouskaya, describing Zaitseva as &quot;an icon of our revolution.&quot; This is utterly heartbreaking. Maria Zaitseva, an icon of our revolution, was killed at just 24 years old while defending &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1E6;. Gravely injured during the 2020 Belarus protests, she gave her life for freedom. My deepest condolences to her family &amp; friends at this unimaginable loss. pic.twitter.com/i7G7wAITrQ After being injured, Zaitseva was treated in the Czech Republic, where she underwent several surgeries. She said that the injury caused a hematoma in her brain. She also lost hearing in one ear. Hundreds of Belarusians have joined the Ukrainian army since 2014, and over 60 of them have been killed in action, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported. In Belarus, volunteer fighters risk imprisonment, and the Lukashenko regime harasses their families.	https://kyivindependent.com/24-year-old-belarusian-volunteer-soldier-killed-in-action/	2025-01-18T02:39:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/--------------2025-01-18-115233.jpg
Ukrainian drones hit Russian oil depot in Tula Oblast, source claims	Ukrainian drones attacked an oil depot in Russia&apos;s Tula Oblast overnight on Jan. 18, a source in Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent. According to the source, the drones, operated by HUR, hit the oil depot at least 10 times in this attack. Tula Oblast, located south of Moscow, has regularly come under attack by Ukrainian drones as Kyiv aims at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry, which is crucial for sustaining Moscow&apos;s war effort, as well as its military hardware. Tula Oblast Governor Dmitry Milyaev said that a fuel storage tank caught fire at &quot;one of the enterprises in the region.&quot; No casualties were reported. Videos posted on social media and shared by residents appear to show a large fire at an oil depot in the town of Uzlovaya in the region. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The attack came amid an uptick in Ukraine&#x2019;s drone attacks targeting Russian energy infrastructure. Earlier in the night, Ukrainian drones also reportedly attacked an oil depot in Russia&apos;s Kaluga Oblast, causing a large fire.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-hit-russian-oil-depot-in-tula-oblast-source-claims/	2025-01-18T00:47:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1249556007.webp
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 9, injure 38 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed nine people and injured at least 38 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Jan. 17. Ukrainian forces downed 24 out of the 39 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Another 14 drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are usually decoys. Russia launches them alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine&apos;s air defense. Russia also launched four ballistic missiles of either the Iskander-M or the North Korean KN-23 model in the early hours of Jan. 18, with two of them downed by Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Fallen wreckage from the downed missiles killed four people and injured at least three others in Kyiv, according to local authorities. The attack damaged a water pipeline, an administrative building, a business center, a store, and cars, the State Emergency Service said. The glass entrance to the Lukianivska metro station and the neighboring McDonald&apos;s building were also damaged.

Hungary's Orban defends ally Antal Rogan sanctioned by US, media reports	Sanctions imposed by the outgoing U.S. administration against Antal Rogan, Prime Minister Viktor Orban&apos;s cabinet chief and overseer of the secret service, have only strengthened Rogan&apos;s position, Orban said during a state radio interview on Jan. 17. In his first comments since the U.S. sanctioned Rogan earlier this month for alleged corruption, Orban defended his close ally. The prime minister&#x2019;s cabinet office dismissed the sanctions as the &quot;last, petty revenge&quot; of the departing U.S. ambassador. &quot;(Rogan) is the minister in charge of national security services, the number one guardian of Hungarian national sovereignty and if he is punished by a big power that means he does his job well, so this is our starting point,&quot; Orban told the broadcaster, according to Reuters. A long-time supporter of President-elect Donald Trump, Orban expressed optimism for a &quot;golden era&quot; in U.S.-Hungarian relations under Trump&#x2019;s leadership. At home, Orban faces mounting challenges, including a rising opposition party and economic difficulties ahead of the 2026 elections. He pledged to intensify efforts to combat what he described as &quot;foreign networks&quot; undermining Hungary&#x2019;s sovereignty. Orban reiterated his criticism of Hungarian-born U.S. financier George Soros, whose liberal ideals have been a consistent target. The prime minister declared his foreign policy objective for the year: &quot;to squeeze out the Soros empire from Europe,&quot; beginning with Hungary. &quot;It is time...for us to eliminate the foreign networks that pose a threat to Hungarian national sovereignty and send them home,&quot; he reportedly said. &quot;Hungary will likely be the first country (in Europe) to squeeze out the Soros empire, this is my definite goal for this year.&quot; For over a decade, Orban&apos;s Fidesz party has targeted Soros and his Open Society Foundations. In 2017, the government introduced stricter rules for foreign-funded NGOs, requiring them to register and disclose their funding sources publicly. Orban Defends Aide Sanctioned by U.S. A year later, Central European University, founded by Soros in 1991, began relocating most of its courses from Hungary to Vienna after a prolonged standoff with Orban&#x2019;s administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungarys-orban-defends-ally-antal-rogan-sanctioned-by-us/	2025-01-17T21:33:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1689139196.jpg
3 killed following Russia's attack on Kyiv	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched an attack on Kyiv early in the morning on Jan. 18, killing at least three people, according to city authorities. According to Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, windows were shattered, and smoke filled the entrance of a residential building in the Shevchenkivskyi district. Several cars caught fire following the attack. A water supply pipeline was also damaged in the area. Repair crews have been dispatched to the site, according to Klitschko. &#xA0; The glass entrance to the Lukyanivska metro station was also damaged, Klitschko said, adding that the station is currently closed for entry and exit, with trains bypassing it without stopping.

Fire reported at oil depot in Russia's Tula Oblast following drone attack	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A fire erupted at an oil depot in the town of Uzlovaya in Russia&apos;s Tula Oblast following a Ukrainian drone attack on the facility overnight on Jan. 18, regional Governor Dmitry Milyaev said. Milyaev said that a fuel storage tank caught fire at &quot;one of the enterprises in the region.&quot; Videos posted on social media and shared by residents appear to show a large fire at an oil depot in the town. Milyaev claimed that there were not casualties as a result of the attack. The Kyiv Independent cannot verify claims made by Russian officials. Ukraine&apos;s military has not yet commented on the attack. No information on the extent of the damage was immediately available. The attack comes amid an uptick in Ukraine&#x2019;s drone operations targeting Russian energy infrastructure. Earlier in the night, Ukrainian drones reportedly attacked an oil depot in Russia&apos;s Kaluga Oblast, causing a large fire. Tula Oblast, located south of Moscow, has regularly come under attack by Ukrainian drones as the country attempts to disrupt Russia&apos;s military supplychain. On Nov. 9, sources told the Kyiv Independent that Ukrainian drones struck the Aleksinsky chemical plant in the region, which produces gunpowder and ammunition for the Russian military. Ukraine has targeted Russia&apos;s fossil fuel infrastructure as part of its strategy to undermine a key funding source for Russia&apos;s war effort. Drone strikes on refineries in Tuapse, Ilyich, and Novoshakhtinsk have led to reductions or suspensions in operations. Overnight on Jan. 14, Ukraine carried out its &quot;most massive&quot; strike on Russian military and industrial facilities within a range of up to 1,100 kilometers (620 miles), according to the General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces. Targets included chemical plants, refineries, and ammunition depots at the Engels airbase, a source in Ukraine&#x2019;s Security Service (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. Amid an uptick in drone attacks, Russia&apos;s seaborne exports of petroleum products declined by 9.1% to 113.7 million metric tons in 2024, Reuters reported on Jan. 17.	https://kyivindependent.com/fire-reported-at-oil-depot-in-russias-tula-oblast-following-drone-attack/	2025-01-17T17:15:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1209343722.jpg
Media identifies nearly 89,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine	Journalists have identified the names of 88,726 Russian soldiers who died during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to a joint investigation by BBC Russia and Mediazona. Since the media outlets&apos; last update in mid-December, the names of 3,965 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties. The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, regional media reports, and statements from local authorities. The confirmed death toll now includes 20,200 volunteers, 15,300 recruited prisoners, and 10,300 mobilized soldiers, according to the media outlets. Over 4,600 officers have also been confirmed to have been killed. Russia has gained ground in eastern Ukraine and Kursk Oblast in recent months but at the cost of heavy casualties as well as equipment losses. The journalists note that as Russian military equipment dwindles, commanders may be forced to provide less protective equipment to soldiers, highlighted by their use of civilian cars in attacks &#x2014; which ultimately may lead to a higher casualty rate. As of Jan. 17, Russia has lost a total of 815,820 troops since the full-scale invasion began, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported. The estimate, which is broadly in-line with estimates made by Western intelligence agencies, likely includes those killed, captured, wounded, and missing. Moscow does not disclose its casualty figures, though a Defense Ministry official recently let slip that the department received 48,000 requests to identify missing soldiers. President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed in a rare statement in early December that Ukraine had lost 43,000 soldiers on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-identifies-nearly-89-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine/	2025-01-17T16:54:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1241060998.jpg
Debris from Russian drones found in Romanian border town, defense ministry confirms	Romania&apos;s Defense Ministry confirmed on Jan. 17 that it had found Russian drone fragments in two communities situated on the Romania-Ukraine border. The two attack drones, located in the communities of Chatalchioi and Kiliya Veche in Tulcea County, were found following a Russian overnight drone attack on Ukraine. Residents in the Romanian border communities received air raid alerts amid the attack. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported it had downed 33 out of the 50 drones launched by Russia overnight on Jan. 16 - 17. Another nine were &quot;lost,&quot; and one more drone flew in the direction of Romania, according to the statement. Romania&apos;s Defense Ministry said that the Russian drones did not cause any casualties or damage. It was not the first time that wreckage of Russian drones have been found on Romanian territory, which is a NATO country. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukrainian port infrastructure on the Danube River that separates Ukraine and Romania. In previous incidents, Romania&apos;s military scrambled F-16 fighter jets to protect the country&apos;s own airspace. The country previously published a draft law that would allow the military to shoot down aircraft that illegally violate Romania&apos;s airspace. Despite the legislative efforts, Bucharest has yet to down Russian drones over its territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/debris-from-russian-drones-found-in-romanian-border-town-defense-ministry-confirms/	2025-01-17T14:55:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1704959103.jpg
French patrol aircraft was 'target of Russian intimidation' over Baltic Sea, French defense minister says	A French maritime patrol aircraft was the target of intimidation tactics over the Baltic Sea overnight on Jan. 17, after the aircraft was locked onto by the radar of a Russian ground-to-air defense system, France&apos;s Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said on social media. The aircraft was patrolling in international airspace over the Baltic Sea overnight between Jan. 16 - 17 as part of a NATO operation, the defense minister said. &quot;This aggressive Russian action is not acceptable,&quot; Lecornu wrote on X. &quot;Our armies will continue to act to defend freedom of navigation in international air and maritime spaces.&quot; The Baltic Sea region has witnessed growing concerns over Russian sabotage since Western nations began supporting Ukraine following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in 2022. On Dec. 25, four telecommunication cables and one power cable in the Baltic Sea were damaged, with Finnish authorities suspecting the involvement of the Russian &quot;shadow fleet&quot; vessel Eagle S. Following the incident, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte vowed to increase NATO&apos;s military presence in the region. On Jan. 14, eight NATO member states bordering the Baltic Sea unveiled a coordinated action plan to address risks to underwater infrastructure following the suspected sabotage. In addition to sabotage efforts, Russia has been repeatedly accused of jamming the GPS signal of various aircrafts, particularly in the Baltic Sea region. In March, Russia likely jammed the satellite signal of a Royal Air Force aircraft used to transport then-U.K. Defence Minister Grant Shapps near Kaliningrad. On Dec. 9, two Dutch F-35 fighter jets intercepted Russian aircraft over the Baltic Sea. Later they were also scrambled again to intercept a Russian IL-20 reconnaissance aircraft. Russian aircraft frequently operate over the Baltic Sea without transponders or flight plans, actions often seen as testing NATO&apos;s response capabilities. .	https://kyivindependent.com/french-patrol-aircraft-was-target-of-russian-intimidation-over-baltic-sea-french-defense-minister-says/	2025-01-17T13:44:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1625904649.jpg

US imposes sanctions against Russian oil tankers under construction for 1st time	Six Russian oil tankers still under construction at Russia&apos;s Zvezda shipyard have been targeted by U.S. sanctions imposed last week, Reuters reported on Jan. 17. The latest sanctions targeted over 180 oil-carrying vessels of Russia&apos;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; a group of aging tankers routinely used for sanction evasion. Several of these vessels are also reportedly involved in transporting sanctioned Iranian oil. For the first time, Washington imposed a ban on the use of tankers even before they went to sea or transported sanctioned cargo. The sanctions will impact named vessels including the Nursultan Nazarbayev, the Alexander Beggrov, the Alexey Bogolyubov, as well as three yet to be named vessels listed as Zvezda 131080, Zvezda 131060, and Zvezda 131040, according to Reuters. The Alexander Beggrov and Alexey Bogolyubov were purchased by the Russian company Sovcomflot. The other four tankers were bought by Rosneft&apos;s shipping division Rosnefteflot. Both buyers of the vessels are under sanctions. Experts cited by Reuters said the latest measures drove up prices of tankers as demand for non-sanctioned vessels grew. The outgoing Biden administration has taken steps to undermine Russian oil exports, which are one of the key fuels of Russian aggression in Ukraine. Recent sanctions also targeted two of Russia&apos;s major oil producers, Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegaz, along with dozens of their subsidiaries. Combined, these companies reportedly produce over 1 million barrels of oil daily, generating an estimated $23 billion of revenue annually, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-imposes-sanctions-for-1st-time-against-russian-oil-tankers-under-construction/	2025-01-17T12:23:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167101990.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia, Iran sign strategic partnership deal; Ukraine strikes Russian S-400 radar equipment	Key developments on Jan. 17: Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian signed a strategic partnership agreement in Moscow on Jan. 17, Russian state news agency TASS reported. Moscow and Tehran have long ties but their cooperation only intensified after the outbreak of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine in 2022. Iran has provided Russia with thousands of Shahed drones used in attacks against Ukrainian cities, as well as short-range ballistic missiles.The document, signed during an official ceremony in the Kremlin, establishes Moscow and Tehran as strategic partners. The agreement covers various areas, including energy, finance, transportation, agriculture, culture, science, technology, and counterterrorism. Russia and Iran have also agreed to strengthen cooperation in security and defense. According to the agreement, if one of the parties is subjected to aggression, the other will not provide any assistance to the aggressor. Moscow and Tehran will also deepen partnerships between their special services, and will assist each other in the event of natural, and man-made disasters. The strategic agreement between Russia and Iran is concluded for 20 years with automatic extension for subsequent 5-year periods. With Iran&apos;s assistance, Russia has begun producing its own variants of Shahed drones called Geran-2. Iran and Russia have also been at the forefront of confronting what they see as the Western-led global order, with namely Tehran sponsoring militant groups in the Middle East attacking the West&apos;s allies. Last June, Putin signed a similar partnership agreement with North Korea, under which both parties agreed to military support each other in case of an armed attack. Months after the deal was signed, North Korea dispatched up to 12,000 troops to help fend off a Ukrainian incursion in Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian forces struck radar equipment of an advanced S-400 air defense system in Russia&apos;s Belgorod Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Jan. 17. According to the military, the positions of Russia&apos;s anti-aircraft missile division of the 568th regiment came under a &quot;long-range fire&quot; on Jan. 16. &quot;The termination of the 92H6 radar station of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system was recorded, which indicates a successful hit on the target,&quot; the statement read. Ukrainian forces also attacked positions of the radar company of Russia&apos;s radio engineering battalion of the 336th regiment in Belgorod Oblast. Damage to vehicles and equipment was recorded, the military said. Moscow has not yet commented on the statement. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Belgorod Oblast lies at the border with Ukraine and is regularly targeted in cross-border drone strikes. Ukraine also struck the Liskinskaya oil depot in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast with drones overnight on Jan. 16, the General Staff claimed. Also, a drone strike reportedly targeted a Russian gunpowder factory in the village of Kuzmino-Gat in Tambov Oblast the same night. U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration has declassified previously undisclosed efforts to support Ukraine&apos;s drone industry, including $1.5 billion funding sent in September 2024, The New York Times reported on Jan. 17, citing anonymous officials. Ukrainian drones have been utilized for reconnaissance, combat, and other missions, showcasing their versatility and impact in countering Russian forces. U.S. intelligence officers reportedly assisted in advancing Ukraine&apos;s drone capabilities, helping to design a new generation of drones intended to revolutionize modern warfare. While much of the U.S. aid for Ukraine has been publicly disclosed &#x2014; covering missiles, air defense systems, tanks, and training &#x2014; support for the drone sector has largely remained secret. The declassified data reveals that the U.S. allocated funds for drone manufacturing and facilitated partnerships between U.S. tech companies and Ukrainian drone producers. These efforts intensified during preparations for Ukraine&apos;s 2023 counteroffensive, which struggled to achieve significant territorial gains, reportedly due to Russia&apos;s extensive drone use. In response, the U.S. accelerated aid to Ukraine&apos;s drone sector. Officials reportedly believe this investment has made Ukrainian drones more effective and deadly. Ukrainian maritime drones, credited with destroying 25% of Russia&apos;s Black Sea Fleet, and aerial drones deployed on the front lines have slowed Russian advances in eastern Ukraine. By the end of 2024, Ukraine had delivered over 200,000 domestically produced drones to frontline units, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said in December. The United States has assured Russian President Vladimir Putin it would not deploy nuclear weapons in Ukraine, outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden said in a Jan. 17 interview with MSNBC. &quot;Tactical nuclear in Europe scares the hell out of everybody, including the Russians,&quot; he said. Biden recounted conversations with Putin, during which the Russian leader emphasized demands to keep nuclear weapons out of Ukraine and block Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership. &quot;I said, &apos;(Nuclear weapons are) not a problem. We&apos;ve already taken the nuclear weapons out. There&apos;s none there. We&apos;re not gonna put them back in,&apos;&quot; Biden responded, without provided the date when such a conversation had occurred. The U.S. president further criticized Putin&apos;s ambitions: &quot;All he wants to do is re-establish the Warsaw Pact. I can&apos;t let that happen. This guy is not a good guy.&quot; These discussions reflect long-standing tensions over Ukraine&apos;s security, which were central to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. Under the agreement, Ukraine relinquished its nuclear arsenal &#x2014; the world&apos;s third-largest &#x2014; in exchange for assurances from the U.S., U.K., and Russia not to use force or economic coercion against Ukraine. Despite these commitments, Russia launched a war against Ukraine and has repeatedly issued nuclear threats against Ukraine and its allies. In November, Putin approved an updated nuclear doctrine, which snow allows Moscow to use nuclear arms against non-nuclear states. Russia later launched the intermediate-range ballistic missile &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; designed for nuclear weapons. A November survey by Russia&apos;s independent Levada Center revealed that 39% of Russians believe nuclear weapons use could be justified in the ongoing war against Ukraine, reflecting the domestic impact of Kremlin rhetoric. Australian volunteer soldier Oscar Jenkins has the status of a prisoner of war (POW) and there is no confirmation of his death, Ukrainian investigative journalism outlet Slidstvo.Info reported on Jan. 17, citing the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. The news comes after reports that the body of Jenkins, a 32-year-old teacher from Melbourne whose capture was reported in December, has been found. He was believed to have been executed by his Russian captors. Some media outlets and Telegram channels published a video purporting to show bodies of soldiers, claiming that Jenkins was among them. Slidstvo.Info verified that footage was published four years ago on an Iranian website. The description says that it was filmed in Nagorno-Karabakh, and the original video is in Armenian instead of Russian. Jenkins is serving in the 402nd Separate Rifle Battalion, which is part of Ukraine&apos;s 66th Separate Mechanized Brigade, the outlet wrote. He went missing on Dec. 16 in 2024 while being on a combat mission near the village of Mykolaivka in Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces Command told Slidstvo.Info. &quot;There has been no transfer of the body (of Oscar Jenkins),&quot; the military said. The Kyiv Independent has contacted the Australian Embassy in Kyiv and the Ukrainian authorities but has not received a response at the time of publication. The Geneva Conventions mandate all warring parties to treat POW with respect and dignity, while executing POWs is considered a gross violation of international law and a war crime. Russia has been repeatedly accused of summarily executing Ukrainian POWs throughout the war. Moscow calls foreign volunteers &quot;mercenaries&quot; and claims they are not entitled to protection under the Geneva Conventions. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese pledged the &quot;strongest action possible&quot; if reports of an Australian national captured while fighting for Ukraine being executed by Russian forces are confirmed. Australia&apos;s Foreign Ministry has also summoned the Russian ambassador on Jan. 15 to demand information and stress compliance with international law.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-iran-sign-strategic-partnership-ukraine-strikes-russian-s-400-radar-equipment/	2025-01-17T12:21:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193780871.jpg
Four Russian officers reportedly killed in Kursk Oblast by Ukraine's Dec. 30 strike	At least four Russian officers were killed in Ukraine&apos;s attack on the town of Lgov in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast on Dec. 30, independent Russian media outlet Mediazona reported on Jan. 17, citing recently published obituaries. Alexander Khinshtein, the acting governor of Kursk Oblast, claimed on Dec. 30 that the attack had injured an 86-year-old woman and damaged a two-story building. The Russian official did not mention any losses among the military. Yet, according to Mediazona, at least four officers of the 76th Air Assault Division with the rank of lieutenant colonel were killed by U.K.-made missiles. One of the killed was Lieutenant Colonel Valeriy Tereshchenko, Mediazona reported, citing an obituary from the Officers&apos; Hockey League page on social media. Eight people from the division&apos;s senior staff were killed, and 22 others were injured in the attack, the obituary read. Two more obituaries about Lieutenant Colonels Pavel Maletsky and Alexei Seliverstov were found by Mediazona on their relatives&apos; social media pages. Another killed officer is Major Ali Tsurov from Ingushetia, who also served in the 76th Air Assault Division, Mediazona reported, citing Russian media outlet Fortanka. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Ukrainian troops carried out another attack on Lgov on Dec. 26, hitting a Russian command post. The attack allegedly killed 18 Russian soldiers. Despite the high losses within Russian and North Korean ranks, Ukrainian forces in Kursk Oblast seem to be increasingly on the back foot, facing a Russian advantage in manpower and equipment. Ukraine&apos;s foothold in Kursk is considered a possible bargaining chip ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s expected push for peace negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/at-least-4-russian-officers-killed-in-kursk-oblast-as-result-of-ukrainian-dec-30-strike-media-reports/	2025-01-17T11:44:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1240563519.jpg
It's not enough' — Ukrainians react to Biden's farewell speech	In his farewell speech from the White House on Jan.15, outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden took the opportunity to highlight his achievements in office in an attempt to help cement his legacy. Yet, despite being one of the world&apos;s biggest international crises that spanned much of Biden&apos;s term in office, Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine only gained a single mention. &quot;Ukraine is still free, and we&apos;ve pulled ahead of our competition with China and so much more,&quot; Biden said as he listed his administration&apos;s accomplishments, including a stronger NATO military alliance. &quot;It will take time to feel the full impact of what we&apos;ve done together. But the seeds are planted, and they&apos;ll grow, and they&apos;ll bloom for decades to come,&quot; he added. The Biden administration provided Ukraine with $65.9 billion in military assistance since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion, making it the largest donor in absolute terms. But how this aid was given has regularly attracted criticism, particularly over the speed of the decision-making process in the White House. Big ticket weapons, including heavy tanks, F-16 fighter jets, and the decision to greenlight long-range missile strikes deep inside Russian territory often only came after weeks or months of political wrangling, hampering Ukraine&apos;s ability to fight back against Russian forces. Then there is Biden&apos;s assertion that &quot;Ukraine is free&quot; &#x2014; Russia continues to occupy roughly one-fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory while its forces are pushing forward in Donetsk Oblast. We asked Ukrainians for their assessment of Biden&apos;s presidency, his legacy in regard to the full-scale invasion, and what he could have done more to help Ukraine. Professor at Kyiv Mohyla Academy, and research advisor at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation We are thankful to the U.S. and personally to President Biden for all the support they have given to Ukraine, including military support. It was of immense importance in rebuffing Vladimir Putin of Russia. I believe that for Biden, Ukraine became a personal issue that he took deeply into his heart. However, all the time support was delayed and not enough. There are different reasons for that but the main one is Putin&apos;s nuclear blackmail which worked, as in the case with other Western leaders, unfortunately. As a result we were not prepared enough for the counteroffensive in late 2022 and summer 2023. The lack of weapons and, therefore, the lack of success have decreased the levels of optimism for Ukrainian soldiers in the war of attrition and, among other reasons, created additional problems for mobilization. U.S. President Joe Biden in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, U.S. on Jan. 10, 2025. (Leigh Vogel / UPI / Bloomberg via Getty Images)Khrystia VengryniukAuthor, and book publisher At the beginning of the war, I believed that NATO would intervene, protect us, that their planes would fly and close the sky over Ukraine, and that this hell would end very quickly. This did not happen. And when they were destroying Mariupol, I was simply convinced, minute to minute, from day to day, they would close the sky over at least this city, where thousands of people and children were killed every day. The world knew what was happening there, but no one intervened. Now they say that 117,000 people died in Mariupol, 15,000 of them children. This can only mean one thing &#x2014; everyone was afraid of Russia. They were so afraid that they could not even protect innocent civilians. But would we have survived as a state if it were not for America and Europe? No, we would not have survived. And the fact that we still exist is indeed a very great, if not the greatest, merit of the U.S. during the Biden presidency. All the weapons, aid, and sanctions from the U.S. helped us hold out. We lost 20% of our territory, we lost hundreds of thousands of people, but we are here and we will be, thanks to Joe Biden first and foremost. the chair of the parliament&apos;s foreign affairs policy I expected the outgoing U.S. president to devote more attention to Ukraine in his farewell speech. Ukraine was mentioned only once. I understand that it was worded very carefully, but it doesn&apos;t sound optimistic enough. It doesn&apos;t say something encouraging and certain about the future of Ukraine. I would like to hear from the outgoing president something more optimistic and encouraging, something like: &apos;The people of the U.S. will never leave Ukraine alone, and American friends of Ukraine will not allow anyone to throw Ukraine under the bus.&apos; This mention of Ukraine is just a statement of a fact, but it&apos;s not about our future. Just one mention of Ukraine after three years of difficult struggle is not enough. Biden knows that we are worried about our future in connection with the new administration, and a few more words of support and encouragement would be psychologically appropriate.	https://kyivindependent.com/its-not-enough-ukrainians-react-to-bidens-farewell-speech/	2025-01-17T10:44:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193208114.jpg
Ukraine ready to help Slovakia achieve energy stability, Zelensky says	Ukraine is ready for dialogue on energy security with Slovakia and can help it achieve energy stability, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 17 at a meeting with a delegation of the Progressive Slovakia political party, which is led by Michal Simecka. Zelensky&apos;s statement follows Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit via its territory, including supplies to Slovakia. Slovak Prime Minister Robet Fico has threatened to limit aid to Ukrainians and cut off electricity supplies due to the termination of Russian gas transit. Earlier on Jan. 17, pro-Western opposition leader Simecka arrived in Kyiv. The Slovak politician&apos;s visit comes a few days after Zelensky invited Fico to Ukraine&apos;s capital to discuss the energy situation. &quot;We are ready to help the Slovak people in ensuring their energy stability and security,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;It is very important for us to hear a signal from the Slovak people that you will also support Ukrainians on our path to the European Union and NATO. This is a key issue for us because of the war, because of the security guarantees that are very important for us.&quot; Zelensky added that the visit of the Slovak delegation &quot;is a signal&quot; that Slovakia will continue to support Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty and independence. The president also reminded that he had invited Fico to Kyiv. &quot;We were ready to host the leader of our friends from Slovakia but another leader arrived,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine did not renew a pre-war agreement to transit Russian gas to Europe via Ukrainian territory, instead allowing the deal to expire on Jan. 1. Kyiv warned repeatedly that it would not extend the deal in order to stop financing Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Fico and his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban have been among some of the most vocal opponents of Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit. Despite Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, Orban and Fico have continued to maintain friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting with him and promoting pro-Russian narratives in Europe. On Jan. 14, Slovakia&apos;s opposition parties announced plans to initiate a vote of no confidence in Fico&apos;s government, citing concerns over his governance and foreign policy direction.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-ready-to-help-slovakia-achieve-energy-stability-zelensky-says/	2025-01-17T10:25:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190701439.jpg
Biden administration secretly funded Ukraine's drone industry, NYT reports	U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration has declassified previously undisclosed efforts to support Ukraine&apos;s drone industry, including $1.5 billion funding sent in September 2024, The New York Times reported on Jan. 17, citing anonymous officials. Ukrainian drones have been utilized for reconnaissance, combat, and other missions, showcasing their versatility and impact in countering Russian forces. U.S. intelligence officers reportedly assisted in advancing Ukraine&apos;s drone capabilities, helping to design a new generation of drones intended to revolutionize modern warfare. While much of the U.S. aid for Ukraine has been publicly disclosed &#x2014; covering missiles, air defense systems, tanks, and training &#x2014; support for the drone sector has largely remained secret. The declassified data reveals that the U.S. allocated funds for drone manufacturing and facilitated partnerships between U.S. tech companies and Ukrainian drone producers. These efforts intensified during preparations for Ukraine&apos;s 2023 counteroffensive, which struggled to achieve significant territorial gains, reportedly due to Russia&apos;s extensive drone use. In response, the U.S. accelerated aid to Ukraine&apos;s drone sector. Officials reportedly believe this investment has made Ukrainian drones more effective and deadly. Ukrainian maritime drones, credited with destroying 25% of Russia&apos;s Black Sea Fleet, and aerial drones deployed on the front lines have slowed Russian advances in eastern Ukraine. By the end of 2024, Ukraine had delivered over 200,000 domestically produced drones to frontline units, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said in December.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-admin-secretly-facilitated-ukraines-drone-industry-nyt-reports/	2025-01-17T09:09:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1604726426.jpg
Basic military training to start in Ukrainian higher education institutions in September 2025	Basic general military training for students of Ukrainian higher education institutions will begin in September 2025, the Defense Ministry announced on Jan. 17. President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier approved amendments to the law on military duty and military service in Ukraine. The updated law stipulates systematic basic military training for students. The course will consist of 90 academic hours of theory study ,and 210 academic hours of practical training. The theory part is compulsory for both men and women, aged 18 to 25. The practical course is mandatory only for men. Women can attend it at their own request, having previously passed a medical examination. During the course, students will gain basic knowledge of tactical, intelligence, and psychological training, first aid, and the basics of military discipline. They will also master the skills of handling weapons, according to the ministry&apos;s statement. Following the basic military training, students will take the military oath, receive a certificate, and obtain a military specialization. Men who complete the course will become liable for military service, but according to the law on mobilization training and mobilization, they will not be drafted into the army until they are 25 years old. Up until that age, they can do so voluntarily. As the full-scale invasion broke out, the Ukrainian government began reviewing educational programs in schools and higher education institutions to ensure that civilians were better prepared for the challenges posed by the war. Starting in 2024, Ukrainian schools also launched a pilot program of the updated Defense of Ukraine subject, which has been taught since Soviet times. The updated program&apos;s subject will become mandatory in 2027.	https://kyivindependent.com/basic-general-military-training-to-start-in-ukrainian-higher-education-institutions-in-september-2025/	2025-01-17T07:54:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2136562481.jpg
Putin, Pezeshkian sign strategic Russia-Iran partnership agreement in Moscow	Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian have signed a strategic partnership agreement in Moscow on Jan. 17, Russian state news agency TASS reported. Moscow and Tehran have long ties but their cooperation only intensified after the outbreak of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine in 2022. Iran has provided Russia with thousands of Shahed drones used in attacks against Ukrainian cities, as well as short-range ballistic missiles.The document, signed during an official ceremony in the Kremlin, establishes Moscow and Tehran as strategic partners. The agreement covers various areas, including energy, finance, transportation, agriculture, culture, science, technology, and counterterrorism. Russia and Iran have also agreed to strengthen cooperation in security and defense. According to the agreement, if one of the parties is subjected to aggression, the other will not provide any assistance to the aggressor. Moscow and Tehran will also deepen partnerships between their special services, and will assist each other in the event of natural, and man-made disasters. The strategic agreement between Russia and Iran is concluded for 20 years with automatic extension for subsequent 5-year periods. With Iran&apos;s assistance, Russia has begun producing its own variants of Shahed drones called Geran-2. Iran and Russia have also been at the forefront of confronting what they see as the Western-led global order, with namely Tehran sponsoring militant groups in the Middle East attacking the West&apos;s allies. Last June, Putin signed a similar partnership agreement with North Korea, under which both parties agreed to military support each other in case of an armed attack. Months after the deal was signed, North Korea dispatched up to 12,000 troops to help fend off a Ukrainian incursion in Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-pezeshkian-sign-strategic-partnership-agreement-in-moscow/	2025-01-17T07:42:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2177151725.jpg
Belarus Week: Belarus to host over 13,000 Russian troops for Zapad-2025 joint military drills	OSCE observers not invited to monitor upcoming presidential election in Belarus. Belarus to host over 13,000 Russian troops for Zapad-2025 joint military drills with Russia. Belarus sentences EU diplomatic staffer to four years in prison. Irregular crossings into EU from eastern borders more than triple in 2024, Frontex reports. Belarusian state TV airs a propaganda film with jailed journalists, attempting to discredit their coverage of 2020 elections ahead of upcoming vote. Belarusian opposition announced it will issue &#x201C;New Belarus&#x201D; passports, yet legal uncertainty remains for exiles. Minsk has not invited observers from the OSCE&#x2019;s Office for Democratic Institutions to monitor the upcoming presidential elections in Belarus, the OSCE announced on Jan. 9. The presidential elections, which are expected to provide Belarus&#x2019;s longtime dictator Alexander Lukashenko with a seventh term in office, are scheduled for Jan. 26. The poll, dismissed as a &#x201C;sham&#x201D; by the Belarusian opposition, will be the first presidential race since the 2020 election &#x2014; which sparked an unprecedented wave of anti-government protests and an ongoing domestic political crisis. The OSCE said Belarus&#x2019; decision not to invite its member states via the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) was &#x201C;regrettable&#x201D; and &#x201C;deprives the country&#x2019;s citizens of a transparent and full assessment of the entire process.&#x201D; &#x201C;The lack of transparency further undermines faith in the electoral system of Belarus,&#x201D; said OSCE PA President Pia Kauma. This is the third time the office will be unable to observe elections in Belarus since the contested 2020 vote &#x2014; it was not invited to observe the 2022 constitutional referendum or parliamentary elections. Speaking at a meeting with the chairs of regional executive committees on Jan. 3, Lukashenko mentioned the idea of inviting international observers, saying, &#x201C;We should meet with the Central Commission once again and decide whether we will invite these foreigners (Western observers) to the elections.&#x201D; However, Lukashenko raised the issue less than three weeks before the elections, with the key stages of the campaign &#x2014; the nomination of candidates, the formation of local electoral committees, and the selection of national observers &#x2014; already having been carried out. The rushed presidential election campaign is being held nearly half a year earlier than is stipulated in Belarus&#x2019;s election law. The Belarusian Central Election Committee (CEC) cleared the heads of three loyalist parties &#x2014; Aleh Haidukevich, Alexander Hizhnyak, and Siarhei Syrankou &#x2014; along with another sham candidate representing the so-called &#x201C;constructive opposition&#x201D; &#x2014; Hanna Kanapatskaya &#x2014; to &#x201C;challenge&#x201D; Lukashenko for the presidency. As of Jan. 8, the Belarusian Central Electoral Committee (CEC) had accredited 362 foreign observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Parliamentary Assembly of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (PA CSTO) &#x2014; all Russia-led international alliances favoring the Lukashenko regime. Among the 28,330 national observers, 79% come from political parties or pro-government professional unions, the independent news outlet Pozirk reports. Since 2020, Lukashenko has eliminated all but four loyal political parties and liquidated over 1,800 civil society organizations. The expert observation mission organized by the Viasna Human Rights Center and the Belarusian Helsinki Committee claims that the electoral campaign is organized in a &#x201C;repressive climate of threat, fear-mongering, pressure, and persecution in connection with any civil activity unauthorized by the state.&#x201D; Over 13,000 Russian troops will participate in the Zapad-2025 joint military exercise, the Belarusian Defense Ministry announced on Jan. 10, citing Major General Valery Revenka. Military allies Russia and Belarus have been conducting the Zapad (&#x201C;West&#x201D; in Russian) strategic drills every two years since 2009. Approximately 12,800 Russian soldiers were hosted in Belarus in 2021. Another military drill, &#x201C;Union Resolve 2022,&#x201D; followed the Zapad-2021, and was used to disguise a troop buildup on the Ukrainian border ahead of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022. In an interview with a state-owned TV channel, Major General Revenka said that Belarus has already notified OSCE member states about the drills in line with the Vienna Document, extending an invitation to &#x201C;allies, friends, partners&#x201D; to observe the exercises. According to Revenka, Belarus &#x201C;views positively&#x201D; only some EU and NATO member countries &#x2014; without specifying which ones. Noting that Belarus had not been invited to observe European military drills last year, Revenka said that a decision regarding an invitation to NATO members remained to be taken. The date of the Zapad-2025 drills has not officially been announced, but they are believed to be scheduled for September 2025. In October 2024, the Belarusian Air Force announced &#x201C;major drills with Russia in September 2025,&#x201D; right after a meeting of the joint board of the Belarusian and Russian Defense Ministries approved a concept plan for the Zapad-2025 joint strategic exercise. The Vienna Document on security and confidence-building requires its members to provide notification 42 days or more prior to holding military drills. Aside from Zapad-2025, Belarus plans to host three military drills &#x2014; Search, Interaction, and Echelon &#x2014; along with members of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), the Russia-led bloc Moscow set up in 2002, over a decade after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact. While not committing Belarusian troops to Russia&#x2019;s war on Ukraine, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko allowed Russia to use Belarusian territory as a jumping off point for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, provided supplies to the Russian army, and offered to host Russian tactical nuclear weapons. Minsk City Court has handed down a four-year prison sentence to a local staff member of the European Union&#x2019;s diplomatic service in Belarus, Politico reported on Jan. 9. The sentence, issued in late December 2024, has only now been made public. The court found the EU staffer, Mikalai Khilo, guilty of &#x201C;incitement of hatred and calls for actions harming Belarus&#x2019;s national security.&#x201D; The EU&#x2019;s External Action Service condemned the decision and reiterated calls for Khilo to be released. &#x201C;We continue calling for Mikalai Khilo&#x2019;s immediate and unconditional release,&#x201D; EU spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Anitta Hipper said in a statement shared with Politico. The EU diplomatic service previously called for Khilo&#x2019;s release ahead of his trial, which was held on Dec. 23. At the time, a Lithuanian member of the European Parliament, Petras Au&#x161;trevi&#x10D;ius, told Politico that Minsk was &#x201C;testing the EU&#x201D; by arresting its employee. He said Belarusian diplomats should be expelled from the EU if Khilo was convicted. Forty-one-year-old Khilo split his time between working for the EU diplomatic mission and serving as a preacher in a local Baptist church, as confirmed by CV (formerly known as Christian Vision) &#x2014; an international Christian ministry that monitors the repression of clergy and religious groups. &#xA0; According to an unnamed EU official, Khilo was detained by the Belarusian KGB security service in front of the EU delegation office on April 24, 2024. The Viasna Human Rights Center, a human rights organization based in Belarus, recognizes Khilo as a political prisoner. Although there have recently been eight rounds of pardons of political prisoners in Belarus, 1,240 political prisoners remain behind bars in the country. According to CV, 86 clergymen from various confessions are behind bars because of their public support for anti-government protests in 2020. The number of detected cases of migrants irregularly entering the European Union through its eastern borders more than tripled in 2024, to 17,000, the European border agency Frontex said in a report on Jan. 14. Following the introduction of European sanctions in 2021 over the contested 2020 presidential election and crackdown on dissent, the regime of Lukashenko orchestrated an artificial migration crisis, allowing migrants from the Middle East and African to storm Belarus-EU borders. Frontex preliminary data show that while the overall number of irregular border crossings to the European Union declined by 38% (returning to the post-pandemic level of 2021), the eastern border route (including Belarus and Ukraine) bucked the general trend: There were 17,000 illegal crossings of the bloc&#x2019;s eastern border out of a total of 239,000 crossings recorded in Europe last year.

(Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images)In 2021, the EU recorded 8,000 illegal crossings of its eastern border, in what Frontex monitoring described as a &#x201C;hybrid operation targeting the EU external border.&#x201D; Following an initial settlement that led to a decline in the registered irregular border crossings to 5,608 in 2023, the artificial migration crisis reignited again, with Russia joining the effort. In late 2024, the EU authorities revealed that 90% of the migrants arriving via Belarus had Russian student or travel visas. The bloc pledged 170 million euros to its eastern members &#x2014; Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Estonia, and Finland &#x2014; and to Norway to fortify their borders. As &#x201C;hybrid warfare&#x201D; involving migrants continues, the border security agencies of Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia have thwarted a total of 36,291 attempts to illegally cross their borders from Belarus in 2024. In 2024, Poland reimposed a 200-meter-wide buffer zone next to its border with Belarus, and considered temporarily suspending the right to asylum. The Belarusian state-owned TV channel ONT aired on Jan. 14 the first segment of propaganda interviews with journalists held in Belarusian prisons, in an apparent attempt to discredit the work of independent media during the 2020 presidential elections. In the aftermath of the 2020 presidential elections in Belarus, widely viewed as neither free nor fair, the free media field in Belarus was eradicated. Thirty-seven journalists remain behind bars on politically motivated charges, and hundreds were forced into exile. In 2024 alone, 35 independent media were branded as &#x201C;extremist&#x201D; and banned in Belarus. The first part of the series &#x201C;about employees of American Media,&#x201D; was filmed in prisons, yet is titled &#x201C;Freedom of Speech.&#x201D; RFE/RL&#x2019;s Belarus Service freelancer and political prisoner Andrey Kuznechyk, who was charged with six years of imprisonment for allegedly &#x201C;creating and participating in an extremist formation.&#x201D; In the interview, Kuznechyk appears in a black robe in the prison yard, looking emaciated. The interviewer urges him to condemn the independent media in Belarus for biased coverage and &#x201C;trying to set Belarus on fire&#x201D; during the 2020 elections. The program is airing ahead of the Jan. 26 presidential elections, the first presidential vote since the contested 2020 race, which is expected to provide Lukashenko with a seventh consecutive term in office. After winning the country&#x2019;s first and last fair election in 1994, Lukashenko remained in power for 30 years, gradually giving up parts of Belarusian sovereignty to Russia. Other segments are to feature RFE/RL Belarus Service journalist Ihar Losik, who has been held incommunicado for nearly two years, as well as former reporter Ihar Karney and opposition activist Yuras Zyankovich, who hold dual citizenship of Belarus and the United States. The international press freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) &#xA0;placed Belarus 167th out of 180 countries in its 2024 Press Freedom Index, calling the country the fourth largest jailer of journalists in the world, and Europe&apos;s most dangerous country for journalists up until Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine. Political opponents of the regime of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko will start accepting applications for the alternative identity documents for exiled Belarusians on Jan. 26, Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya has announced on her Telegram channel. In September 2023, Lukashenko barred Belarusian embassies from issuing or renewing passports of Belarusians living abroad, forcing the regime&#x2019;s critics to return to Belarus &#x2014; risking arrest &#x2014; to renew their essential documents. As a result of Lukashenko&#x2019;s move, over 300,000 exiles who have fled Belarus since the contested 2020 elections risk finding themselves in legal limbo, unable to prove their identity, renew residence permits, or access essential services in host countries with expired passports. In response, the Belarusian opposition in exile announced the &#x201C;New Belarus&#x201D; passport project in 2023, but there was little progress on it in 2024. After a change of leadership of the project and a scandal involving the Lithuanian contractor for producing the passports &#x2014; which was found to have ties with the Lukashenko regime &#x2014; the opposition has since produced the first prototypes of the passport. However, the new document has yet to be recognized as suitable for travel or as official proof of identity, and it will initially be available only to EU-based Belarusians due to verification constraints, according to project head Marius Gudelaitis. Franak Viachorka, a chief advisor to Tsikhanouskaya, said that the passports will have &#x201C;specific functionality&#x201D; within a year. &#x201C;Our goal is that this document can replace a foreign passport, be used for travel, and also replace expired (Belarusian) passports when submitting documents for legalization, for example,&#x201D; Viachorka told news outlet Zerkalo. However, the former head of the passport project, Valery Kavaleuski, who earlier resigned from Tsikhanouskaya&#x2019;s Transitional Cabinet, has warned that gaining recognition for the document under present conditions is unlikely. According to Kavaleuski, the issuing center has had to undergo an independent audit before issuing the documents. Besides, the passport will reportedly use a new country code, instead of the existing Belarusian one, which Kavaleuski described as a &quot;dead end&quot; for the recognition process. The passport will be presented to the public at the &#x201C;Belarusians Deserve Better&#x201D; congress in Warsaw, Poland on Jan. 26 &#x2013; the same day as Lukashenko&apos;s latest presidential election, which has been dismissed as a sham by the Belarusian opposition. Meanwhile, Belarusian prosecutors have already issued warnings that congress participants could face criminal prosecution.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-week-belarus-to-host-over-13-000-russian-troops-for-zapad-2025-joint-military-drills/	2025-01-17T07:41:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2176902499.jpg
Hungary's Orban urges EU to lift Russia sanctions, media reports	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban urged the European Union to lift sanctions on Russia, news portal Telex reported on Jan. 17. According to the Hungarian outlet, Orban said it&apos;s &quot;time to throw sanctions out the window&quot; and establish a sanctions-free relationship with Russia during a radio interview. He also described the European Union as being in a &quot;drunken stage&quot; but predicted a &quot;sobering up&quot; in Brussels. The statements come as Orban reportedly told EU leaders he plans to wait until U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office before deciding on extending the bloc&apos;s sanctions against Russia, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 19. Orban, whose government is widely regarded as the EU&apos;s most Russia-friendly, has repeatedly criticized aid for Ukraine, arguing it prolongs and escalates the war. &quot;If they hadn&#x2019;t cheated in 2020, Donald Trump would have remained president, and then there would be no Ukrainian-Russian war,&quot; he said, referencing false claims that President Joe Biden stole the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Orban framed peace in Ukraine as essential to Hungary&apos;s economic goals, saying that European perspectives on Ukraine should go beyond the &quot;lens of war.&quot; Orban also announced plans for protective economic measures to &quot;safeguard&quot; Hungarian agricultural sectors, citing Ukraine as a potential economic threat to Europe. Orban&apos;s remarks come amid strained relations between Hungary and the EU. In July, the European Commission criticized Hungary for failing to meet democratic standards, particularly regarding political financing, conflicts of interest, and media independence. Opposition leader Peter Magyar called for early elections on Jan. 1, citing Orban&apos;s declining popularity and allegations of corruption, which Magyar claims have turned Hungary into &quot;the EU&apos;s poorest, most corrupt nation.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/hungarys-orban-urges-eu-to-lift-sanctions-restore-ties-with-russia-media-reports/	2025-01-17T07:25:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190447641.jpg
How will Russia’s war end?	Incoming U.S. President Donald Trump promised to end the Ukraine-Russia war during his campaign. As inauguration approaches on Jan. 20, the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Francis Farrell lays out the four scenarios that could see an end to the war in Ukraine &#x2014; for better or worse.	https://kyivindependent.com/how-will-russias-war-end/	2025-01-17T07:04:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/4-1.jpg
Ukrainian special forces target Russian soldiers behind POW executions — several reportedly killed, captured	Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces reported on Jan. 17 that they had located and targeted Russian soldiers responsible for executing two Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs). According to the unit, several were killed, and three were captured. The detainees are reportedly providing testimony. The targeted Russian soldiers had allegedly taken two Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces fighters captive days earlier, later executing them on the orders of their company commander, the Special Operations Forces said. The unit conducted an operation to eliminate the group, recover the bodies of the Ukrainian soldiers, and capture any surviving members. The captured Russians were identified as marines from the 40th Arctic Brigade. During interrogations, they allegedly admitted to taking the Ukrainian POWs and executing them under orders. Ukrainian forces reportedly killed three members of the firing squad during the operation, while three others, including one identified by the call sign &quot;Yaryy,&quot; were captured. The Kyiv Independent cannot verify the claims. Throughout the full-scale war, Ukraine has documented widespread violations of the Geneva Conventions by Russian forces, including the execution of at least 124 Ukrainian POWs, according to the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. Reports of torture, murder, and abuse of Ukrainian captives &#x2014; particularly in Donetsk Oblast &#x2014; have surged in recent months. Visual evidence of these atrocities continues to emerge, underscoring Russia&apos;s disregard for international law.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-targets-russian-soldiers-behind-pow-executions-several-killed-captured/	2025-01-17T06:53:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-17-at-1_45_03-PM.jpeg
Russia’s seaborne oil exports decline 9.1% in 2024 amid Ukrainian drone attacks, Reuters reports	Russia&apos;s seaborne exports of petroleum products declined by 9.1% to 113.7 million metric tons in 2024, reflecting mounting challenges to its fossil fuel industry, Reuters reported on Jan. 17. Ukraine has targeted Russia&apos;s fossil fuel infrastructure as part of its strategy to undermine a key funding source for Russia&apos;s war effort. Drone strikes on refineries in Tuapse, Ilyich, and Novoshakhtinsk have led to reductions or suspensions in operations. Russian refineries reportedly processed approximately 267 million metric tons of oil in 2024, the lowest since 2012, as rising production costs, falling prices, and an export ban on gasoline strained operations. Exports through Baltic ports fell by 9% to 61.96 million tons, while shipments via Black and Azov Sea ports dropped 10% to 42.75 million tons. Notably, exports from Tuapse plummeted by a third to 9.1 million tons, largely due to drone attacks and operational disruptions at state-owned Rosneft refineries. Exports from Novorossiysk increased by 4% to 19 million tons. Arctic ports, including Murmansk and Arkhangelsk, saw a 14% decline in exports to 1.01 million tons, while Far Eastern ports experienced a 3% drop to 7.97 million tons. Despite the overall annual decline, marine exports of petroleum products rose 10.8% in December to 10.37 million tons. Sanctions from the Biden administration and the U.K., announced on Jan. 10, have further pressured Russia&apos;s oil sector. These measures target nearly 200 vessels in the &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; key oil companies, and associated entities. The sanctions have driven Brent crude prices up by nearly $5 per barrel. G7 nations are reportedly considering tightening the $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian oil.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-marine-oil-exports-decline-9-1-in-2024-amid-ukraines-attacks-reuters-reports/	2025-01-17T05:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/Rosneft.jpg
Europe needs plans A, B, and C for Trump and Russia	Listening to the confirmation hearings of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s various appointees in Congress this week, it&apos;s becoming clear there is no meaningful grand plan from Trump to end the war in Ukraine quickly. In fact, Trump, along with figures like Keith Kellogg, the incoming Ukraine envoy, has backtracked from claiming the war could be ended in days &#x2014; around the time of the inauguration &#x2014; to acknowledging it may take months. This suggests they are still searching for a strategy. There is a genuine desire to end the war, as Trump says, to &quot;stop the killing&quot; and reduce the U.S. budget burden. For some hardline MAGA China hawks (such as former White House chief strategic Steve Bannon), there&apos;s also a desire to strike a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, possibly in a Nixonian way, realigning for an eventual confrontation with China. These hawks often envision a world where the West and Russia form a Judeo-Christian alliance against China&#x2019;s non-believers. For Trump, the solution seems simplistic: give Putin some &#x201C;wins&#x201D; &#x2014; allowing him to keep the territories he holds, blocking NATO membership for Ukraine, restricting Ukraine&apos;s use of Western long-range missiles, and moderating sanctions. In return, Trump believes Putin would halt the war. The assumption here is that Ukraine&#x2019;s victory would simply be Putin halting offensive military actions. This is naive. It overlooks Ukraine&#x2019;s security, which is central to both its stability and Europe&#x2019;s security. Trump&#x2019;s recent comments about territorial claims on Canada, Greenland, and the Panama Canal suggest he shares Putin&#x2019;s long-held view that great powers deserve &#x201C;spheres of influence.&#x201D; This could indicate that Trump might even entertain a &quot;Yalta 2&quot; scenario, where Putin gets Ukraine, and Trump gains Canada, Greenland, and the Panama Canal. The question remains &#x2014; would Chinese President Xi Jinping be invited to the table, and what would he get? The issue from the perspective of long-term Putin watchers is that such a deal wouldn&#x2019;t satisfy Putin. He would take everything Trump offers, then push for more. This is the pattern of all Putin&#x2019;s conflicts, from Georgia to Moldova, Ukraine, Syria, and Libya. For Putin, it&#x2019;s not just about territory &#x2014; it&apos;s about eradicating the very system of Western liberal market democracy. Putin&apos;s invasion of Ukraine wasn&#x2019;t about NATO membership &#x2014; an unrealistic prospect in 2014. It was about the threat posed by Ukraine&#x2019;s shift from a Russian client state under then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych to a potential member of the Western club of liberal market democracies with the 2013 EU association agreement. Putin feared that if Ukraine succeeded in adopting a democratic, rules-based order, Russians would demand the same, threatening his own rule. It is democracy, not NATO, that Putin despises. He&#x2019;s in an existential battle with the West &#x2014; it&#x2019;s kill or be killed. Trump simply doesn&#x2019;t understand this, or doesn&#x2019;t care. Putin will not stop at a &#x201C;Yalta 2.&#x201D; He seeks total victory over the West. What Trump doesn&#x2019;t grasp is that unless any peace deal ensures Ukraine&#x2019;s security from future attack, Putin will inevitably use any perceived weakness as an excuse for further military invasions. This reality means Ukraine won&#x2019;t receive the investment necessary for its economic development. Without this, Ukraine risks repeating the 22 years of failed economic progress between 1991 and 2013, a period when it remained caught between East and West without a clear anchor, leading to social and political instability.

(Mathilde Kaczkowski /Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty Images)Ask why Ukraine had two revolutions in 2004-2005 and again in 2014. History will surely repeat itself if millions of soldiers and migrants return to disappointment, leading to further instability that Putin could exploit, either to influence Ukrainian politics or justify future invasions. Trump isn&#x2019;t going to provide the leadership Ukraine or European security needs. Yes, his call for European partners to boost defense spending to 5% of GDP is a bold one, but because Trump will likely fail in his peace plan for Ukraine, Europe must take the lead &#x2014; and perhaps should have done so already. Europe needs Plans A, B, and C. Plan A: Educate Trump about the importance of securing a lasting peace for Ukraine. The pitch to Trump should focus on his aversion to failure. He must be told that if Ukraine lacks the security to fend off Putin, it could collapse entirely. This would be devastating for Europe, as millions of migrants would move westward, destabilizing European economies and their social fabric. A weakened Europe would become a reduced market for U.S. goods and a less valuable long-term ally in the looming battle with China. All this would happen on Trump&#x2019;s watch &#x2014; it would make Biden&#x2019;s failure in Afghanistan look like a sideshow. Plan B: Emphasize how ensuring Ukraine&#x2019;s security could benefit the U.S. economy. Ukraine has proven capable of defending itself but could have already won the war with timely, well-supplied Western &#x2014; mainly U.S. &#x2014; military support. NATO membership and bilateral security agreements are desirable but unlikely given the politics. Better for Ukraine to trust in its own defense, provided it is assured the necessary military technology and kit will be delivered. The U.S. defense industry is the only one capable of supplying these. Europe, a $26 trillion economy, is more than capable of funding this effort &#x2014; likely around $150 billion annually, a modest price considering that each 1% increase in NATO spending, due to the Russian threat, costs Europe $250 billion per year. Europe could even fund increased defense spending by unlocking $330 billion in frozen Russian assets, dedicating a significant portion to purchasing U.S. military equipment. Europe should also play to Trump&#x2019;s ego. Pledge a ten-year, $1 trillion European-Ukrainian U.S. defense purchasing program, naming it the &quot;Trump Defense of Democracy in Europe&quot; program &#x2014; a modern-day Marshall Plan. Plan C: Prepare for Trump&#x2019;s potential failure and a bad peace deal that could lead to Ukraine&#x2019;s eventual defeat. If this occurs, Europe must step up financial and arms supplies to Ukraine, buying time to ramp up its own defense capacity to 4-5% of GDP. At the same time, Europe should maintain sanctions against Russia, regardless of U.S. actions. If the U.S. doesn&#x2019;t provide support, Europe should explore diplomatic, economic, and security ties with other powers like Turkey and even China. Though China poses a strategic threat to the U.S., for Europe, Russia remains the primary concern.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-needs-plans-a-b-and-c-for-trump-and-russia/	2025-01-17T05:26:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2179656491.jpg
Slovak opposition leader arrives in Kyiv to 'reopen door Fico slammed'	A Slovak delegation headed by pro-Western opposition leader Michal Simecka of Progressive Slovakia party arrived in Kyiv on Jan. 17, he said on social media. &quot;Our goal is clear &#x2014; to reopen the door that Robert Fico slammed with his aggressive outbursts,&quot; Simecka wrote, who in turn initiated a confidence vote set for next week. His visit comes days after President Volodymyr Zelensky invited Fico to visit Kyiv on Jan. 17 amid the Slovak prime minister&apos;s threats to limit aid to Ukrainians and cut off electricity supplies due to the termination of Russian gas transit through Ukraine to Europe. Fico said on Jan. 16 he may meet with Zelensky in the &quot;next few days.&quot; According to the opposition leader, the Slovak delegation is planning to hold &quot;important talks&quot; with a Ukrainian side. &quot;Slovakia and Ukraine are close partners and can help each other a great deal,&quot; he said. Ukraine did not renew a pre-war agreement to transit Russian gas to Europe via Ukrainian territory, instead allowing the deal to expire on Jan. 1. Kyiv warned repeatedly that it would not extend the deal in order to stop financing Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Fico and his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban have been among some of the most vocal opponents of Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit. Despite Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, Orban and Fico have continued to maintain friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting with him, and promoting pro-Russian narratives in Europe. On Jan. 14, Slovakia&apos;s opposition parties announced plans to initiate a vote of no confidence in Fico&apos;s government, citing concerns over his governance and foreign policy direction. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/slovak-opposition-leader-arrives-in-kyiv-to-reopen-door-fico-slammed/	2025-01-17T04:54:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/--------------2025-01-17-140018.png
First Deputy Education and Science Minister: Rebuilding Ukraine, one classroom at a time	The Economist recently reported that Ukraine is winning the economic war against Russia for the first time since the full-scale invasion began. Although the country has yet to return to its pre-war economic levels, the trajectory is promising. To sustain and accelerate this momentum, strategic investments, particularly in education, are crucial. Investments in education have a multiplier effect, acting as a key driver of long-term economic growth. International support for Ukraine&#x2019;s education sector is vital not just for recovery but for the social capital necessary for enduring progress. As Ukraine enters its third year of full-scale war, the education system continues to operate under extraordinary circumstances. At the start of last year, one in seven schools was destroyed or damaged, and over 1.8 million students lost access to in-person education. The true cost, however, goes beyond physical destruction. It includes disrupted learning, emotional tolls on children, and the disconnection of students in occupied territories or abroad. Despite these challenges, Ukraine has made significant strides in restoring education, prioritizing in-person learning where possible. These efforts have been bolstered by a 40% increase in state education funding over the past two years and substantial international support. For the past year and a half, I&#x2019;ve worked at Ukraine&#x2019;s Ministry of Education and Science, promoting what I call &#x201C;educational diplomacy&#x201D; &#x2014; advocating for Ukraine&#x2019;s needs on global platforms and mobilizing resources. Today, 35 countries and more than 80 international organizations are helping support Ukrainian education, including leaders from UNICEF, UNESCO, the World Bank, and the Global Partnership for Education (GPE). This international collaboration is delivering tangible results that extend beyond financial contributions, translating into concrete initiatives that impact students and teachers, laying a strong foundation for Ukraine&#x2019;s recovery and future development. In wartime, education &#x2014; a fundamental right &#x2014; is often one of the first casualties. Restoring it requires both innovation and collaboration. For example, the Device Coalition and international partners have provided over 247,990 devices since 2022, particularly to students in front-line and border areas, ensuring access to online learning. Workers clear debris from a school building damaged by a missile attack in Kramatorsk, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on April 24, 2023, amid Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. (Anatolii Stepanov/AFP via Getty Images)Safe in-person learning also depends on the availability of shelters. In response, the Ukrainian government allocated $178 million for the construction of underground schools in 2024, with $147 million more planned for 2025. &#xA0;Together with the support of partners such as the European Union, Belgium, Lithuania, UNESCO, and UNITED24 donors, we will be able to help over 100,000 children return to school. Additionally, the Coalition for Textbooks has distributed more than 7.5 million books to ensure students have the resources to thrive. Key funding initiatives include a $28.2 million collaboration with GPE and a $21 million project with Education Cannot Wait, focused on Ukraine&#x2019;s most affected regions. Looking to the future, Ukraine is aligning its education system with European Union standards and investing in its human capital. For instance, UNICEF is supporting reforms in preschool and inclusive education, while the World Bank has provided unprecedented financial backing for general secondary education. I recall the early days of my tenure when our team traveled to Washington to discuss education funding with the World Bank. What seemed an uphill battle led to the groundbreaking $415 million LEARN project &#x2014; one of the largest in the World Bank&#x2019;s portfolio &#x2014; supporting the New Ukrainian School (NUS) reform and marking the first significant World Bank funding for Ukrainian schools in over a decade. Ukraine&#x2019;s educational transformation extends beyond recovery. By 2027, the country will adopt a European-style 12-year education model. Vocational education is being revitalized with support from Swiss experts and DECIDE, while higher education reform is being advanced through a $200 million program in partnership with the World Bank. Throughout the war, Ukraine continues to develop sustainable educational reforms. A $2.7 million capacity-building grant from GPE is one of the resources enabling these efforts. Building international partnerships is a long and rewarding process. Behind every achievement is a great deal of coordination, advocacy, and collaboration. These partnerships are built on mutual trust, shared vision, and a deep commitment to Ukraine&#x2019;s future. Educational diplomacy is a two-way street, and we are committed to being a reliable and innovative partner, sharing our expertise gained through adversity. Ukraine&#x2019;s experience is unique: despite the devastation of war, we are not only restoring education but also laying the groundwork for a stronger, more resilient future. This progress would not be possible without the collective efforts of the global community. The quality of Ukraine&#x2019;s education system reflects the strength of international cooperation and the shared commitment to achieving sustainable development goals. By investing in Ukrainian education today, we are shaping a brighter future for both our country and the world. To all those who stand with us, I extend my deepest gratitude.

The flaws in Ukraine's new brigades and foreign training programs	Newly formed brigades within the Ukrainian military face critical challenges on the front lines. Poor management, lack of experience, and inadequate training have resulted in territorial losses, damaged equipment, and tragic casualties. NATO&#x2019;s training methods often fail to align with the realities of modern warfare. Despite receiving advanced equipment and personnel, these brigades falter due to weak coordination and leadership. These units lack a solid command and control &#x201C;backbone.&#x201D; Their core comprises reserve officers, officers from non-combat roles, and individuals promoted despite prior underperformance in combat positions. One of the most striking examples is the 155th Mechanized Brigade. Despite receiving modern equipment, training in France, and near full staffing, the unit&#x2019;s command lacked experience and an understanding of combat management, organization, and critical support elements, rendering it ineffective. Over 1,700 soldiers have gone AWOL (absent without leave). These brigades are often redeployed to the front, far from their assigned sectors. After gaining some battlefield experience within &#x201C;established&#x201D; brigades, they are stripped of equipment, weapons, and personnel. I know of approximately 10 such brigades operating under these conditions. Commanders are chosen by military leadership, and Western partners equip these units with advanced weaponry, including armored personnel carriers, infantry fighting vehicles, and tanks. However, most soldiers lack the training to effectively operate this equipment in combat. Instead, experienced specialists in the established brigades, who know how to operate such weapons, are temporarily assigned to infantry roles. Artillerymen, mechanics, anti-tank gunners, and drone operators are placed in infantry positions due to limited expertise elsewhere. New equipment, like Mk 19 grenade launchers and M2 Browning machine guns, replace older systems, like T-64 tanks and AGS-17 grenade launchers &#x2014; but only temporarily. In Europe, soldiers may learn basic skills like shooting rifles and throwing grenades, but this accounts for only 10-15% of what is needed to survive. To endure on the battlefield, an infantryman must know how to camouflage, maneuver, set up positions, counter drones, provide medical aid, conduct surveillance, report accurately, and coordinate with comrades. Trust in leadership, which ensures comprehensive planning and support, is paramount. Unfortunately, such vital training is often neglected abroad and exists in Ukraine only within seasoned units. For example, officers of the 155th Mechanized Brigade were unable to lead troops to positions near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast because their transport lacked a radio-electronic warfare system, leaving them unable to navigate safely. Driving unarmored vehicles to the front is perilous, and even military buses are unsafe just 10 kilometers from the front line. An infantryman typically receives an assault rifle, four magazines, body armor, a helmet, a first aid kit, and a uniform. Yet, survival also requires radios, extra batteries, tablets, additional magazines, grenades, shovels, trench radio-electronic warfare systems, and drones like the Mavic. Volunteers and soldiers&apos; families supply most of these essentials &#x2014; everything except the grenades. Photo for illustrative purposes: A recruit from the 108th Separate Mechanized Battalion &quot;Da Vinci Wolves&quot; trains to operate drones in central Ukraine on March 12, 2024. (Valentyna Polishchuk / Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)When a soldier joins a unit equipped with adequate resources and confident leadership, he will do everything to stay. Conversely, soldiers sent to positions immediately after European training or basic military training in Ukraine, without further preparation, often face fatal outcomes or abandon their posts. Time that could have been spent on coordination, adaptation, and effective task distribution was squandered. This failure to prepare has resulted in poorly motivated, untrained soldiers, leading to operational setbacks and heavy casualties. The realities of modern warfare show that foreign training, unless adapted to Ukrainian conditions and integrated with unit practices, is not only ineffective but dangerous. Ironically, our soldiers &#x2014; mechanics, drivers, tankers, artillerymen, grenade launchers, and machine gunners &#x2014; often teach NATO instructors how to operate the equipment provided. All we truly need from our partners is a proper maintenance manual. Substantial reforms are urgently needed in Ukraine&#x2019;s basic combat training. However, no reforms can succeed without commanders who earn the trust of soldiers and volunteers alike. The absence of this trust has led many soldiers to leave struggling brigades in favor of units with better leadership, taking advantage of laws decriminalizing initial desertion. Resources &#x2014; both personnel and equipment &#x2014; must be allocated to units that prioritize the lives of Ukrainian soldiers and deliver results.

Russian attack on Kryvyi Rih kills 4, injures 3, damages educational institution	Russia launched a missile attack on Kryvyi Rih, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, on Jan. 17, resulting in the deaths of four people and leaving at least three others injured, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. Lysak said the attack damaged an educational institution and a residential building. Local authorities are assessing the full scope of casualties and damage. According to the governor, the injured are a 22-year-old woman and two men, aged 34 and 56, all of whom are in critical condition.

US assured Putin no nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Biden says	The United States assured Russian President Vladimir Putin it would not deploy nuclear weapons in Ukraine, outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden said in a Jan. 17 interview with MSNBC. &quot;Tactical nuclear in Europe scares the hell out of everybody, including the Russians,&quot; he said. Biden recounted conversations with Putin, during which the Russian leader emphasized demands to keep nuclear weapons out of Ukraine and block Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership. &quot;I said, &apos;(Nuclear weapons are) not a problem. We&apos;ve already taken the nuclear weapons out. There&apos;s none there. We&apos;re not gonna put them back in,&apos;&quot; Biden responded, without provided the date when such a conversation had occurred. The U.S. president further criticized Putin&apos;s ambitions: &quot;All he wants to do is re-establish the Warsaw Pact. I can&apos;t let that happen. This guy is not a good guy.&quot; These discussions reflect long-standing tensions over Ukraine&apos;s security, which were central to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. Under the agreement, Ukraine relinquished its nuclear arsenal &#x2014; the world&apos;s third-largest &#x2014; in exchange for assurances from the U.S., U.K., and Russia not to use force or economic coercion against Ukraine. Despite these commitments, Russia launched a war against Ukraine and has repeatedly issued nuclear threats against Ukraine and its allies. In November, Putin approved an updated nuclear doctrine, which snow allows Moscow to use nuclear arms against non-nuclear states. Russia later launched the intermediate-range ballistic missile &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; designed for nuclear weapons. A November survey by Russia&apos;s independent Levada Center revealed that 39% of Russians believe nuclear weapons use could be justified in the ongoing war against Ukraine, reflecting the domestic impact of Kremlin rhetoric.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-assured-putin-no-nuclear-weapons-in-ukraine-biden-says/	2025-01-17T03:28:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184603402.jpg
There's no evidence that Australian fighter was executed by Russia, prosecutors told media	Australian volunteer soldier Oscar Jenkins has the status of a prisoner of war (POW) and there is no confirmation of his death, a Ukrainian investigative journalism outlet Slidstvo.Info reported on Jan. 17, citing the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. The news comes after reports that the body of Jenkins, a 32-year-old teacher from Melbourne whose capture was reported in December, has been found. He was believed to have been executed by his Russian captors. Some media outlets and Telegram channels published a video purporting to show bodies of soldiers, claiming that Jenkins was among them. Slidstvo.Info verified that footage was published four years ago on an Iranian website. The description says that it was filmed in Nagorno-Karabakh, and the original video is in Armenian instead of Russian. Jenkins is serving in the 402nd Separate Rifle Battalion, which is part of Ukraine&apos;s 66th Separate Mechanized Brigade, the outlet wrote. He went missing on Dec. 16 in 2024 while being on a combat mission near the village of Mykolaivka in Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces Command told Slidstvo.Info. &quot;There has been no transfer of the body (of Oscar Jenkins),&quot; the military said. The Kyiv Independent has contacted the Australian Embassy in Kyiv and the Ukrainian authorities but has not received a response at the time of publication. The Geneva Conventions mandate all warring parties to treat POW with respect and dignity, while executing POWs is considered a gross violation of international law and a war crime. Russia has been repeatedly accused of summarily executing Ukrainian POWs throughout the war. Moscow calls foreign volunteers &quot;mercenaries&quot; and claims they are not entitled to protection under the Geneva Conventions. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese pledged the &quot;strongest action possible&quot; if reports of an Australian national captured while fighting for Ukraine being executed by Russian forces are confirmed. Australia&apos;s Foreign Ministry has also summoned the Russian ambassador on Jan. 15 to demand information and stress compliance with international law.	https://kyivindependent.com/no-evidence-that-australian-volunteer-was-executed-by-russia/	2025-01-17T02:58:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Oscar-Jenkins-1.png
Trump has opportunity to 'negotiate a good deal' in Ukraine, Blinken says	The incoming Trump administration will be in a position to broker a &quot;good&quot; and &quot;strong&quot; peace deal in Ukraine, provided that Kyiv agrees, outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a press briefing on Jan. 16. &quot;So I believe that the incoming administration is in a position where, if the Ukrainians so desire and so choose, it can help to negotiate a good deal,&quot; Blinken said after commenting that thanks to the Biden administration and international partners, Russia has failed to subdue Ukraine. &quot;And President (Donald) Trump talks about having good, strong deals. &#xA0;I think there&#x2019;s an opportunity to get one.&quot; Trump, taking office on Jan. 20, has pledged to swiftly push for a peace settlement in the Russia-Ukraine war after taking office, prompting fears he might pressure Kyiv toward painful concessions. His team signaled that the new administration would seek to preserve Ukraine&apos;s independence, though Blinken&apos;s expected successor, Marco Rubio, said that both Kyiv and Moscow would have to make concessions to achieve a peace deal. Since invading Ukraine in 2014 and escalating its war of aggression in 2022, Russia has occupied about 20% of Ukrainian territory, imposing repressive measures on the local population and prohibiting any expressions of Ukrainian identity. Ukraine has repeatedly said it would not recognize its territory currently under Moscow&apos;s control as Russian. Blinken noted that any potential ceasefire must be enduring and not simply a pause that will give Russian President Vladimir Putin a chance to &quot;rest, refit, and then when he deems the moment right, re-attack.&quot; &quot;So you have to have built into any ceasefire the effective deterrence necessary so that he doesn&#x2019;t re-attack. &#xA0;That is, I think, a necessary part of any good, strong deal for Ukraine,&quot; the chief U.S. diplomat said. The secretary of state also highlighted the Biden administration&apos;s efforts to put Ukraine into the strongest possible position in any peace talks, stressing that Russia suffered massive battlefield losses and faces mounting economic difficulties. &quot;The losses that Russia has incurred are almost unimaginable &#x2013; I think, by some assessments, 700,000-800,000 casualties. &#xA0;That includes those killed and those wounded,&quot; Blinken said. The Biden administration ramped up its support for Ukraine since Trump&apos;s reelection, announcing several major packages of security assistance, easing restrictions on long-range strikes inside Russia, and imposing sweeping sanctions on the Russian energy sector.	https://kyivindependent.com/blinken-on-trump-ukraine-deal/	2025-01-17T01:58:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2160746692.jpg
Ukraine produced over 30,000 bomber drones in 2024, minister says	Ukraine produced more than 30,000 bomber drones in 2024, Ukraine&apos;s Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin said on Jan. 16, as unmanned systems become an increasingly vital capability in the war with Russia. The bomber drones were created during Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion and operate mainly at night. They can also remotely disperse mines or transport ammunition, food, and medicine to Ukrainian positions. Due to their ability to strike at night, Russian soldiers reportedly dub these drones &quot;Baba Yaga,&quot; after a mythical witch. &quot;There are already dozens of bomber drones in Ukraine, and more than 30,000 pieces were produced last year,&quot; Smetanin said. These, as well as several other reconnaissance drones, were presented to President Volodymyr Zelensky and the U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer during the latter&apos;s visit to Kyiv on Jan. 16. According to Smetanin, Kyiv and London also developed a carrier platform for first-person-view (FPV) drones. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks by Ukrainian troops. Kyiv delivered more than 200,000 domestically-produced drones to front-line units as of the end of 2024, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-produced-over-30-000-bomber-drones-in-2024-minister-says/	2025-01-17T01:23:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-16_21-40-22.jpg
Navalny's lawyers sentenced to 3.5-5.5 years in prison	A court in Russia&apos;s Vladimir Oblast sentenced three former lawyers of late opposition leader Alexei Navalny to between three and a half and five and half years in prison, the independent news outlet Mediazona reported on Jan. 17. Vadim Kobzev, Alexei Liptser, and Igor Sergunin were sentenced after a closed-door trial on &quot;extremism&quot; charges over their involvement with Navalny&apos;s Anti-Corruption Foundation. The foundation was the flagship project of Navalny, Russia&apos;s most known opposition leader, who died under unclear circumstances in a Russian prison colony in February 2024. The news underscores Russia&apos;s increasingly harsh repressions against domestic opposition, which only escalated with the outbreak of the full-scale war against Ukraine in 2022. &quot;Extremism&quot; charges are widely seen as a tool to suppress and scare off voices that criticize the current leadership or Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. Kobzev was sentenced to five and half years, Liptser to five years, and Sergunin to three and half years in prison. They sare also barred from practicing law for three years after the completion of their prison sentences. The three were detained in October 2023 after being accused of &quot;using their status&quot; as lawyers to facilitate communication between imprisoned Navalny and his organization, labeled as &quot;extremist&quot; by Russian authorities, Meduza reported. Launched in 2011, the Anti-Corruption Foundation has published investigations into suspected corruption among top Russian officials, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and former President Dmitry Medvedev. Russia designated the group as &quot;extremist&quot; and formally dissolved it in 2021. The foundation was relaunched as an international organization the following year. Olga Mikhailova and Alexander Fedolov, two other Navalny&apos;s ex-lawyers charged with &quot;extremism,&quot; have left Russia and are wanted by Russian authorities. Moscow&apos;s crackdown targets other prominent opposition figures as well. On Jan. 16, Russian law enforcement officers raided the home of oppositionist Illia Yashin&apos;s parents. Yashin was previously sentenced to eight and half years in 2022 for denouncing Russia&apos;s war crimes in Ukraine. He was released during a large-scale prisoner exchange between Moscow and the West in August 2024 and now resides abroad.	https://kyivindependent.com/navalny-lawyers-jailed/	2025-01-17T01:17:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2170733603.jpg
Ukraine strikes Russian S-400 radar equipment in Belgorod Oblast, military claims	Ukrainian forces struck radar equipment of the advanced S-400 air defense system in Russia&apos;s Belgorod Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Jan. 17. According to the military, the positions of Russia&apos;s anti-aircraft missile division of the 568th regiment came under a &quot;long-range fire&quot; on Jan. 16. &quot;The termination of the 92H6 radar station of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system was recorded, which indicates a successful hit on the target,&quot; the statement read. Ukrainian forces also attacked positions of the radar company of Russia&apos;s radio engineering battalion of the 336th regiment in Belgorod Oblast. &#x421;&#x438;&#x43B;&#x438; &#x43E;&#x431;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x43E;&#x43D;&#x438; &#x423;&#x43A;&#x440;&#x430;&#x457;&#x43D;&#x438; &#x443;&#x440;&#x430;&#x437;&#x438;&#x43B;&#x438; &#x440;&#x430;&#x434;&#x456;&#x43E;&#x43B;&#x43E;&#x43A;&#x430;&#x446;&#x456;&#x439;&#x43D;&#x443; &#x442;&#x435;&#x445;&#x43D;&#x456;&#x43A;&#x443; &#x440;&#x43E;&#x441;&#x456;&#x439;&#x441;&#x44C;&#x43A;&#x438;&#x445; &#x43E;&#x43A;&#x443;&#x43F;&#x430;&#x43D;&#x442;&#x456;&#x432; &#x43D;&#x430; &#x442;&#x435;&#x440;&#x438;&#x442;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x456;&#x457; &#x411;&#x454;&#x43B;&#x433;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x43E;&#x434;&#x441;&#x44C;&#x43A;&#x43E;&#x457; &#x43E;&#x431;&#x43B;&#x430;&#x441;&#x442;&#x456;. &#x417;&#x430;&#x444;&#x456;&#x43A;&#x441;&#x43E;&#x432;&#x430;&#x43D;&#x43E; &#x43F;&#x440;&#x438;&#x43F;&#x438;&#x43D;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x43D;&#x44F; &#x444;&#x443;&#x43D;&#x43A;&#x446;&#x456;&#x43E;&#x43D;&#x443;&#x432;&#x430;&#x43D;&#x43D;&#x44F; &#x440;&#x430;&#x434;&#x456;&#x43E;&#x43B;&#x43E;&#x43A;&#x430;&#x446;&#x456;&#x439;&#x43D;&#x43E;&#x457; &#x441;&#x442;&#x430;&#x43D;&#x446;&#x456;&#x457; 92&#x41D;6 &#x437;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x456;&#x442;&#x43D;&#x43E;&#x433;&#x43E; &#x440;&#x430;&#x43A;&#x435;&#x442;&#x43D;&#x43E;&#x433;&#x43E; &#x43A;&#x43E;&#x43C;&#x43F;&#x43B;&#x435;&#x43A;&#x441;&#x443; &#x421;-400, &#x449;&#x43E; &#x441;&#x432;&#x456;&#x434;&#x447;&#x438;&#x442;&#x44C; &#x43F;&#x440;&#x43E; &#x443;&#x441;&#x43F;&#x456;&#x448;&#x43D;&#x435; &#x443;&#x440;&#x430;&#x436;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x43D;&#x44F; &#x446;&#x456;&#x43B;&#x456;.https://t.co/AAnlwjtCje pic.twitter.com/IzOUGo0NqB Damage to vehicles and equipment was recorded, the military said. Moscow has not yet commented on the statement. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Belgorod Oblast lies at the border with Ukraine and is regularly targeted in cross-border drone strikes. Ukraine also struck the Liskinskaya oil depot in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast with drones overnight on Jan. 16, the General Staff claimed. Also, a drone strike reportedly targeted a Russian gunpowder factory in the village of Kuzmino-Gat in Tambov Oblast the same night.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hits-russian-radar-equipment-in-belgorod-oblast-military-claims/	2025-01-17T00:32:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1258244285.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 1, injure 16 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed one person and injured at least 16 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Jan. 17. Ukrainian forces downed 33 out of the 50 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Another nine were &quot;lost,&quot; and one more drone flew in the direction of Romania, according to the statement. Fallen wreckage from the downed drones injured a 12-year-old boy in Kyiv Oblast, said Mykola Kalashnyk, acting head of the regional military administration. The debris caused a fire in a cafe and the adjacent boiler room. The fire, which covered an area of around 200 square meters, has now been contained. The blast broke windows in a nearby building. Russian drones also targeted port infrastructure near the town of Izmail in Odesa Oblast, Governor Oleh Kiper said. The residential building was damaged. No casualties were reported. A Russian Molniya-1 drone hit the roadway in the city of Kharkiv, injuring three men aged 44, 46, and 48, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Five cars were damaged. In Sumy Oblast, three people suffered injuries as a result of a Russian first-person-view (FPV) drone attack, according to the region&apos;s military administration. The attack also damaged an apartment building and a car. Two people were injured in the town of Rodynske in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 37 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Seven people were injured over the past day, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. A Russian drone also attacked a bus stop in the village of Antonivka in Kherson Oblast, killing a man on the morning of Jan. 17, Prokudin said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-1-injure-16-over-past-day/	2025-01-16T23:49:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-17_08-33-51.jpg
Allied support for Ukraine won't suddenly change with Trump's inauguration, top NATO officer assures	NATO has taken over some responsibilities in coordinating aid for Ukraine from the U.S. with Washington&apos;s consent, ensuring a stable support mechanism going forward, NATO Military Committee Chief Admiral Rob Bauer said on Jan. 16. &quot;And that doesn&apos;t change on Monday,&quot; Bauer said at a press conference of NATO military chiefs in Brussels, referring to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump has pledged to swiftly push for a peace settlement in the Russia-Ukraine war after taking office, prompting fears he might reduce military support or push Kyiv toward painful concessions. This led to other partners in the pro-Kyiv coalition preparing mechanisms for stable security assistance for Ukraine should Trump decide to withdraw the U.S. involvement. &quot;The framework after Washington (summit) is to transfer some of the things that were organized by the U.S. now into NATO,&quot; Bauer said. &quot;The SAG-U (Security Assistance Group - Ukraine), the IDCC (International Donor Coordination Center), that was a group of nations helping Ukraine. Now, NATO is taking over that responsibility, and the United States has agreed to that.&quot; These decisions are based on the NATO Washington Summit in July 2024 and were included in its final communique. Bauer said these changes aim to create a stable mechanism to ensure continued support for Ukraine, regardless of political changes. The Dutch admiral added that this is reassuring for Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi &quot;because for him, the war doesn&apos;t change because of what happens in the White House. The war is there (in Ukraine) on Monday as well.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/allied-support-for-ukraine-wont-suddenly-change-with-trumps-inauguration-top-nato-officer-says/	2025-01-16T23:44:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2095077756.jpg
Italy's upcoming military aid package to Ukraine includes 'modern weaponry,' Umerov says	Ukraine will receive a new military aid package from Italy, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Jan. 16 after meeting with his Italian counterpart Guido Crosetto in Kyiv. &quot;(The military aid package) is already on its way to Ukraine,&quot; Umerov said. &quot;This is modern weaponry that will help our soldiers to deliver powerful strikes against the enemy.&quot; The two ministers agreed to strengthen defense cooperation between Kyiv and Rome. The countries also plan to launch joint ventures and other initiatives to support the Ukrainian defense industry. According to Umerov, Crosetto backed the continuation of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meetings, known as the Ramstein format. &quot;This is critical for providing everything our defenders need,&quot; the Ukrainian minister said. Crosetto also met with President Volodymyr Zelensky and discussed security guarantees for Ukraine. Italy&apos;s 10 military aid packages to Ukraine have included advanced weapons systems like the French-Italian SAMP/T air defense units. The country&apos;s cabinet approved a decree on Dec. 23 extending the supply of military aid to Kyiv through the end of 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/italys-upcoming-military-aid-package-to-ukraine-includes-modern-weaponry-umerov-says/	2025-01-16T23:08:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-16_21-55-42.jpg
German FM slams her government over hesitancy on Ukraine aid	Germany is not currently seen as a &quot;driving force for peace policy in Europe,&quot; German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told Politico in comments published on Jan. 17, criticizing her own government for hesitancy in the support of Ukraine. &quot;Even now, during the election campaign, some prioritize a national perspective &#x2014; or how to quickly gain a few votes in the parliamentary election &#x2014; rather than taking real responsibility for securing Europe&#x2019;s peace and freedom,&quot; Baerbock said Her comments come a little over a month before the snap parliamentary elections prompted by the Free Democratic Party (FDP) leaving the governing coalition with Baerbock&apos;s Greens and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos;s Social Democrats (SPD). Foreign policy issues like the Russia-Ukraine war are becoming key topics of the electoral campaign as the parties gear up for the vote on Feb. 23. The conservative CDU/CSU alliance, which has called for more decisive steps in support of Kyiv, is currently leading the polls. Baerbock&apos;s statement also reveals a growing rift in the intermin Social Democrat-Greens cabinet as Scholz is reluctant to greenlight an additional 3 billion euros ($3.1 billion) in security assistance for Kyiv. Despite Baerbock&apos;s and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius&apos; (SPD) support for the new assistance tranche, the chancellor said he would sign off on it only if it is paid with additional borrowing, an unpopular step among other parties. Delays in German assistance &quot;means that Ukraine is less able to defend itself and, therefore, less able to defend us,&quot; Baerbock said during a meeting of diplomats in Saudi Arabia last week. Berlin stands as Ukraine&apos;s second largest military donor, a role of growing importance as Ukraine faces a heavy Russian onslaught in the east of the country, and the future of U.S. support appears uncertain under the incoming Trump administration. Germany has allocated 4 billion euros ($4.1 billion) in military support for Ukraine this year, and the additional package would raise this to 7 billion ($7.2 billion). The defense articles contained in the new assistance include three IRIS-T air defense systems, three Skyranger air defense systems, 10 howitzers, surface-to-air missiles, 20 protective vehicles, artillery shells, and drones, the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported. Scholz&apos;s stance was criticized by the FDP, which claimed that the chancellor initially actively pushed for approving the 3 billion euro package, provided it is paid through borrowing. The opposition by the FDP&apos;s Finance Minister Christian Lindner reportedly led to his dismissal and the coalition&apos;s collapse.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-fm-slams-her-government-over-hesitancy-on-ukraine-aid/	2025-01-16T23:02:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190247028.jpg

Russian hackers target WhatsApp in new tactic, Microsoft warns	The Russian hacker group Star Blizzard launched a spear phishing campaign in November via the messaging platform WhatsApp, marking a change in longstanding tactics, Microsoft reported in a blog post on Jan. 16. Phishing messages use social engineering tactics to manipulate recipients, exploiting emotions to trick targets into revealing sensitive information or clicking malicious links. Star Blizzard sent invitations to join a WhatsApp group to current and former officials in government and diplomacy, international relations and defense researchers, and people and organizations offering assistance to Ukraine amid Russia&apos;s full-scale war, according to Microsoft. This is the first time the hacker group has been observed using this tactic. The shift to WhatsApp may be related to successful cybersecurity efforts exposing Star Blizzard&apos;s techniques, Microsoft said. In the most recent campaign, Star Blizzard hackers impersonated U.S. government officials in emails directing recipients to join a WhatsApp group via QR code. The WhatsApp group claimed to focus on &quot;the latest non-governmental initiatives aimed at supporting Ukraine NGOs.&quot; The purpose of the campaign was to gain access to targets&apos; WhatsApp accounts and extract their data. While the campaign seemed to subside in late November 2024, Microsoft warned that the shift in tactics signals Star Blizzard&apos;s versatility and &quot;tenacity in continuing spear phishing campaigns to gain access to sensitive information.&quot; Russian hacker groups have engaged in various forms of cyber warfare throughout the full-scale war, including cyberattacks against Ukraine, hacks of civilian infrastructure in Europe, and interference in foreign elections.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-hackers-target-whatsapp-in-new-tactic-microsoft-warns/	2025-01-16T21:25:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2189475787.jpg
UK to play 'full part' in peacekeeping efforts in Ukraine, Starmer says	The United Kingdom will play its &quot;full part&quot; in supporting efforts to maintain an enduring peace in Ukraine, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer told Sky News on Jan. 16. Starmer&apos;s remarks followed his meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv, where the leaders signed a historic 100-year partnership agreement between Ukraine and the U.K. When asked if the U.K. was prepared to deploy peacekeeping troops to Ukraine to monitor a potential ceasefire, Starmer said he had discussed the matter with Zelensky during his visit. &quot;I&apos;ve been discussing this with a number of allies ... including President Zelensky here today,&quot; Starmer said in an interview with Sky News. &quot;But we will play our full part. We have always been one of the leading countries in relation to the defense of Ukraine, so you can read into that that we will be playing our full part.&quot; Bloomberg reported on Jan. 10 that Starmer was expected to discuss the possible peacekeeping mission with Zelensky during his visit. Starmer said he did not want to &quot;get ahead of ourselves&quot; in terms of specific plans but said the U.K. was committed to taking a leading role in ensuring a lasting peace in Ukraine. &quot;Because this isn&apos;t just about sovereignty in Ukraine ... If Russia succeeds in its aggression, it will impact us for a very long time,&quot; he said. London and Paris have already begun discussing the possibility of deploying French and U.K. troops to monitor a ceasefire along the front line in Ukraine, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported in December. Starmer on Jan. 16 confirmed that he and French President Emmanuel Macron have discussed the issue. The idea of deploying a peacekeeping force on the ground in Ukraine has gained traction in recent months as European nations prepare to play a greater role in Kyiv&apos;s defense once U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Trump reportedly supports the idea and told Zelensky and Macron during their trilateral meeting on Dec. 7 that he wants European troops to monitor a future ceasefire. Ahead of Zelensky&apos;s meeting with Starmer, the president spoke with Macron on Jan. 14 regarding &quot;practical steps&quot; for implementing such a plan.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-to-play-full-part-in-peacekeeping-efforts-in-ukraine-starmer-says/	2025-01-16T19:44:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2194219228.jpg
Zelensky, Italian Defense Minister discuss security guarantees at meeting in Kyiv	President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto in Kyiv on Jan. 16 to discuss Italy&apos;s ongoing military assistance to Ukraine. Crosetto&apos;s arrival in Kyiv was announced earlier on Jan. 16, the same day that U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer signed a 100-year partnership agreement with Zelensky. Zelensky and Crosetto discussed defense support and security guarantees for Ukraine, the presidential office said. Topics addressed included bolstering air defense systems, training Ukrainian personnel in Italy, and joint defense production. The president highlighted the importance of investing in Ukraine&apos;s defense industry, particularly drone production. Ukraine&apos;s future NATO membership as &quot;the most effective&quot; security guarantee possible, one that would advance &quot;a just and lasting peace for all Europe.&quot; The leaders also discussed plans for the Ukraine Recovery Conference, scheduled to take place in Rome July 10-11. Zelensky thanked Crosetto and the Italian government for the country&apos;s 10th military aid package to Ukraine, approved last month. Crosetto said Italy remains committed to supporting Ukraine&apos;s defense needs and that the focus is now on the next round of military aid to Kyiv. &quot;I came here to discuss the 11th support package, as the 10th has already been approved,&quot; Crosetto said. &quot;As we have already discussed, now is the moment &#x2014; perhaps the most critical moment in the past three years &#x2014; to increase support.&quot; Crosetto&apos;s visit comes mere days before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. The transition of power in Washington is expected to significantly disrupt the balance of Western support for Ukraine amid the full-scale war. European countries are preparing to play a greater role in addressing Ukraine&apos;s defense priorities if the U.S. shifts its focus from aid to negotiations. Italy&apos;s 10 military aid packages to Ukraine have included advanced weapons systems like the French-Italian SAMP/T air defense units. The country&apos;s cabinet approved a decree on Dec. 23 extending the supply of military aid to Kyiv through the end of 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-italian-defense-minister-discuss-security-guarantees-at-meeting-in-kyiv/	2025-01-16T18:51:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/ItalianDM.jpeg
Russian drone attack in Kyiv Oblast injures child	Russia launched a drone attack against Kyiv Oblast the evening of Jan. 16, causing a fire and injuring a child, Mykola Kalashnyk, acting head of the regional military administration, reported. Air defense units intercepted targets over an unnamed town in Kyiv Oblast, Kalashnyk said. Falling wreckage from the downed drones injured a 12-year-old boy. &#xA0; The boy has been hospitalized and is receiving medical attention, Kalashnyk said. No other casualties were reported. The falling debris also caused a fire to break out in a cafe and the attached boiler room. The fire, which covered an area of around 200 square meters, has now been contained. The blast broke windows in a nearby building. &#xA0; Russian drone attacks against Kyiv Oblast and the city of Kyiv surged in late fall 2024. Drone strikes have targeted residential areas and critical energy infrastructure in the region. As Moscow intensifies strikes, it also aims to ramp up domestic drone production, with plans to manufacture 6,000 Shahed-style attack drones per year at the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in Tatarstan.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-attack-in-kyiv-oblast-injures-child/	2025-01-16T17:40:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2147527243.jpg
Netherlands announces $27 million in aid for Ukraine following Dutch Foreign Minister's visit to Kyiv	Following his visit to Kyiv, Dutch Foreign Minister Kaspar Veldkamp announced 27 million euros ($27.8 million) in new aid for Ukraine on Jan. 16. According to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, the package includes 7 million euros ($7.2 million) through the Comprehensive Assistance Package, coordinated by NATO, to provide non-lethal support such as fuel, medical supplies, winter equipment, and electronic warfare systems. An additional 20 million euros ($20.6 million) is being allocated to the Ukraine Energy Support Fund to assist with critical infrastructure needs. The announcement came during Veldkamp&#x2019;s meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha. In Dec. 2024, The Netherlands pledged a contribution of $23 million to bolster Ukraine&apos;s air defense systems and cyber resilience. The country also previously supplied Ukraine with several Patriot air defense launchers, most recently delivering three in November.	https://kyivindependent.com/netherlands-announces-27-million-in-aid-for-ukraine-following-dutch-foreign-ministers-visit-to-kyiv/	2025-01-16T16:54:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2162501104.jpg
Biden administration prioritized sanctions strategies over designating Russia as state sponsor of terrorism, US official says	The Biden administration believes that large-scale sanctions have been more effective politically than designating Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism, Ukrinform reported on Jan. 16, citing U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller. &quot;We do not consider this [recognizing Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism] to be the most effective way to achieve existing political goals when we talk about Russia,&#x201D; Miller said at a press briefing. He noted that recent US sanctions, including measures targeting Russia&apos;s energy sector, have had tangible effects, such as halting tankers carrying Russian oil worldwide. Miller also said that labeling Russia as a terrorism sponsor could hinder international humanitarian efforts and complicate operations in the region. The latest round of U.S. sanctions was passed on Jan. 15. The U.S. Treasury imposed new sanctions on a total of over 150 entities and individuals, including companies in Russia&#x2019;s defense industry and those supporting it, as well as dozens of entities across multiple countries that help Russia evade U.S. sanctions. The Treasury also expanded measures against almost 100 entities already under sanctions for their cooperation with Russia&#x2019;s military-industrial complex.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-administration-prioritized-sanctions-strategies-over-designating-russia-as-state-sponsor-of-terrorism-us-official-says/	2025-01-16T14:17:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2155312256.jpg
Absurd phenomenon' — The manpower issue threatening to weaken Ukraine's Air Force	Critically lacking manpower on the front lines where Russia continues to use its vast manpower advantage to make grinding advances, Ukraine has been scrambling specialists into the infantry in an effort to replenish losses. Criticized widely by soldiers and experts for a &#x201C;wasteful&#x201D; use of specialist troops that have spent years honing their skills, the short-term solution has frequently led to their death or injury, according to soldiers interviewed by the Kyiv Independent over 2024. Ukraine has been struggling with a manpower shortage &#x2014; especially in the infantry &#x2014; while Russia has intensified its offensive in Donetsk Oblast since the summer of 2024. The issue of sending specialist troops to infantry units had largely been hidden in the shadows until a video surfaced online on Jan. 14, prompting responses from President Volodymyr Zelensky, and the General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces. In the almost three-minute-long video, around a dozen Ukrainian servicemen from the Air Force stand, as one reads aloud a message about what they describe as &#x201C;a real challenge&#x201D; that could &#x201C;destroy the very foundation of our aviation.&#x201D; &#x201C;Since 2014, we have been preparing and maintaining the aircraft, ensuring combat missions in the most difficult conditions, both day and night, defending our homeland from the enemy,&#x201D; the speaker of the group &#x2013; all wearing masks &#x2014; says. A Ukrainian Tactical Aviation pilot poses in the cockpit of his MIG-29 fighter jet at sunset in eastern Ukraine on Aug. 1, 2023. (Libkos / Getty Images)The aviation and technical personnel, who say that they have been fulfilling missions on Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets for over a decade, said they received an order to send &quot;almost all technicians to the infantry, which means we will be left without technical personnel to service our aircraft.&quot; The Ukrainian military command was trying to transfer 218 specialists to the infantry when the video was released, and 250 were previously transferred, according to the speaker. &#x201C;The technical staff is actually being destroyed, and without us, the aviation will not be able to function,&#x201D; he says. According to the Ukrainian online newspaper Ukrainska Pravda, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi issued an order on Jan. 11 to transfer over 5,000 Air Force personnel to Ground Forces units. A senior Air Force officer, speaking anonymously to the outlet, said transfers began in spring 2024 and have now reached a &quot;critical level,&quot; with unit staffing dropping to 50%. An Air Force serviceman speaking on the condition of anonymity to the Kyiv Independent, painted an even grimmer picture. He said around a couple thousand Air Force servicemen had already been transferred to the infantry since the beginning of the full-scale war, with about 40 % being killed, and 40% wounded in the first days if they were directly sent to the front, while some were still fighting. He added that these are often people who studied for around four years, and further built their knowledge over years of service, stressing the issue dampens morale. In a rare example of a public outcry reaching the Ukrainian authorities, Zelensky on Jan. 14 tried to reassure that such transfers wouldn&#x2019;t be made. &#x201C;There has been much concern and discussion today regarding these reassignments,&quot; he said in his evening address. &quot;I have instructed that everything be explained to the public and not to reduce the ranks of specialists critical to the Air Force &#x2014; aviation, air defense, and mobile fire units.&quot; The General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces also insisted on the same day that &quot;there were no plans to transfer the acute shortage of specialists of the Air Force&#x2019;s engineering and aviation service who maintain aircraft to infantry units.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky speaks at a press conference during the European Council Meeting in Brussels, Belgium, on Dec. 19, 2024. (Pier Marco Tacca / Getty Images)&#x201C;Instead, the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is increasing the number of technical and flight personnel,&#x201D; it added. Acknowledging the &quot;not easy&quot; situation on the front, and that &quot;many areas lack infantrymen,&quot; the General Staff said the transfer of some personnel is &quot;a necessary step&quot; to strengthen defense by reinforcing combat brigades with soldiers from other branches of the Armed Forces. But it stressed that Syrskyi prohibited the transfer of high-tech specialists and those trained abroad on foreign models of weapons and equipment. Understanding the complexity of the issue, some soldiers however remain pessimistic about the prospect of possible improvements going forward. The core issue is that no one is bearing responsibility, according to the anonymous Air Force serviceman. He said that the order comes to transfer a certain number from a specialist unit, and the local commander has to pick whom to send, which he said is often difficult because &#x201C;we need everyone&#x201D; and there is no replenishment. &#x201C;Maybe for them (in the military leadership), it&apos;s just a number, not people,&#x201D; the Air Force serviceman said, adding there should be a &#x201C;responsibility and accountability&#x201D; mechanism for the generals making the decisions. Glen Grant, a former British army lieutenant colonel who has advised the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, and closely observes military issues in Ukraine, said that resource management problems persist due to the lack of competent generals, and the inability to learn from mistakes. &#x201C;You just don&apos;t take your technicians and put them into harm&apos;s way because you need them as technicians,&#x201D; the Latvia-based military expert told the Kyiv Independent. A Ukrainian MiG-29 performs a combat mission in eastern Ukraine on Aug. 1, 2023. (Libkos / Getty Images)&#x201C;You may strengthen one area, but then you weaken another area, so the compensation is lost. You&apos;re still back where you are, except you are actually twice worse off because you probably lose the technicians, dead.&#x201D; A couple of recent appointments, such as that of General Mykhailo Drapatyi as the commander of Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces in November 2024, offers hope, according to Grant, but it is still unclear whether it will be enough to change the overall dynamics of the Ukrainian military leadership. &#x201C;The message is clear that the people don&apos;t value soldier&apos;s lives if they&apos;re going to send them into the front line without being properly trained,&#x201D; Grant said. Ukrainian military expert Mykhailo Zhyrokhov on the other hand said he was skeptical of the number of specialists that the Air Force members said were being transferred to the infantry. He argued that the situation is &#x201C;ambiguous&#x201D; because there is no confirmation that such a number is thrown into the front-line trenches, and he doubts the Ukrainian military leadership would &#x201C;shoot itself in the foot&#x201D; and &#x201C;destroy aviation&#x201D; as has been claimed. &#x201C;It is typical human behavior &#x2014; nobody wants to go to the front, despite the fact that they are professional soldiers, they are contract soldiers, and they have been there all this time, these last twenty years defending the sky,&#x201D; Zhyrokhov told the Kyiv Independent. He also raised questions about how the servicemen obtained the numbers when the information was &#x201C;secret.&#x201D; With the Air Force gradually Westernizing its Soviet-era models of aircraft, there is a surplus of specialists who are only familiar with the older versions who would be sent to the reserves if the country was not at war, according to Zhyrokhov. He said he believed that the surplus, such as the guards based at the airbases, would be sent to non-combat roles as a solution. Mentioning Air Force personnel who fought in hot spots in the east in 2023, such as in the Battle of Bakhmut, Zhyrokhov argued that Air Force servicemen have to immediately get used to the grim realities of the war, just like civilian-turned-soldiers. &#x201C;In wartime, such cases exist, have existed, are present, and will continue to exist,&#x201D; Zhyrokhov said. Ukrainian open-source war monitoring website DeepState, which said that it received a hundred reports from soldiers about the issue concerning the transfer of Air Force and Air Defense specialists to the infantry after the scandal came to light, said that a large number said they received only a few days&#x2019; training before being sent into brigades and &quot;the picture there is not the best.&#x201D; &#x201C;The deliberate sending of specialists who have specific skills, knowledge and experience and their absence directly affects the work of the unit,&#x201D; DeepState said in a Telegram post. Summarizing it an &#x201C;absurd phenomenon,&#x201D; DeepState said the effectiveness of the transfer of specialists to infantry &#x201C;has always been minimal&#x201D; and also resulted in the loss of some servicemen who attained valuable skills abroad.	https://kyivindependent.com/absurd-phenomenon-the-manpower-issue-threatening-to-weaken-ukraines-air-force/	2025-01-16T12:12:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-1677405750.jpg
NATO deploys Norwegian F-35 fighters for 1st time during Russian Jan. 15 attack on Ukraine	NATO scrambled Norwegian F-35 fighter jets stationed in Poland for the first time to protect airspace during a Russian attack on Ukraine on Jan. 15, the NATO Air Command reported on X. Russia attacked Ukraine using cruise and ballistic missiles on Jan. 15, targeting critical infrastructure in several oblasts. Ukrainian forces shot down 30 missiles and 47 drones. &quot;This is the first time the Norwegian jets have scrambled in the active air defense of Polish Airspace, demonstrating Allied commitment to NATO&apos;s eastern flank,&quot; the statement read. Two F-35 fighter jets were involved in the defense of NATO airspace, according to the NATO Air Command. Poland announced on the same day that it was scaling up its air force due to Russia&apos;s mass attack on Ukraine, with additional pairs of fighter jets deployed and ground-based air defense and radar systems on high alert. Russian drones and missiles have previously entered Poland&apos;s airspace during attacks on Ukraine. However, Polish allies advised the government to exercise restraint when dealing with unidentified airspace violations, according to Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Most Poles believe the Polish military should shoot down Russian drones that enter Polish airspace during aerial attacks on Ukraine, according to a survey published on Sept. 1 by the Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said in September that Poland and neighboring countries to Ukraine are &quot;responsible for protecting their own airspace,&quot; despite NATO&apos;s opposition.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-deploys-norwegian-f-35-fighters-for-1st-time-during-russian-jan-15-attack-on-ukraine/	2025-01-16T12:03:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2173881672.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine, UK sign 100-year partnership agreement	Key developments on Jan. 16: President Volodymyr Zelensky and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer signed a 100-year partnership agreement during their meeting in Kyiv on Jan. 16. The wide-ranging deal encompasses cooperation in military, energy, scientific, cultural, economic, and other sectors. The agreement builds upon the trade and partnership agreement signed by the two countries in 2020 and the bilateral security deal penned in January 2024. The document, published by Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office, includes 10 main pillars from strengthening defefense capabilities and supporting Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations to cooperation in trade, energy, and justice and accountability. &quot;(Russian President Vladimir) Putin&apos;s ambition to wrench Ukraine away from its closest partners has been a monumental strategic failure,&quot; Starmer said in a statement. &quot;Instead, we are closer than ever, and this partnership will take that friendship to the next level.&quot; The United Kingdom will also provide new military aid for Ukraine, including 150 artillery barrels, a mobile air defense system, and an expanded training initiative with allied nations, the government announced on Jan. 16. This year, the U.K. plans to deliver unprecedented military support to Ukraine, with 3 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) already committed for lethal aid. &quot;This funding will not only support Ukraine but also bolster the U.K.&apos;s defense industry, creating jobs across the country,&quot; the statement reads. The first 1.5 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) of a 2.26-billion-pound ($2.7 billion) loan, part of the G7 loan program to Kyiv, will also be released for major procurement projects. The loan will be repaid using profits from immobilized Russian assets. The military aid includes artillery barrels manufactured by Sheffield Forgemasters, the first such production in the U.K. in over 20 years. The barrels are expected to be delivered to Ukraine within weeks. The U.K. will also provide a mobile air defense system developed in partnership with Denmark, aimed at enhancing Ukraine&apos;s ability to counter Russian missile and drone attacks. The training initiative builds on the success of Operation Interflex, which has trained over 51,000 Ukrainian recruits in the past two years. The U.K. plans to expand this effort in collaboration with international allies. Ukrainian soldiers struck the Liskinskaya oil depot in Voronezh Oblast and gunpowder factory in Tambov Oblast with drones overnight on Jan. 16, Ukraine&apos;s military said. According to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, the targeted oil depot stored fuel used for the needs of the Russian army. The statement came after Russian reports of the oil depot on fire in Voronezh Oblast. The village of Liski in Voronezh Oblast lies over 150 kilometers (98 miles) east of the Ukrainian border. In an attack conducted by the Special Operations Forces and other units of Ukraine&apos;s Defense Forces, at least three drones hit the facility, causing a large-scale fire, the General Staff said. A Ukrainian drone strike also reportedly targeted a Russian gunpowder factory in the village of Kuzmino-Gat in Tambov Oblast overnight on Jan. 16. Eyewitnesses in the nearby city of Kotovsk heard the sound of a drone engine as it was passing over their houses, presumably heading to the factory, the Shot Telegram channel reported. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its forces downed 27 Ukrainian drones over various regions overnight, including three in Tambov Oblast. Russian authorities said there were no casualties as a result of the attack in Tambov Oblast and that the roof of a house was damaged by drone debris. It is not immediately clear whether the plant suffered any damage due to the attack. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The Kuzmino-Gat gunpowder factory is &quot;one of the key facilities of the Russian military-industrial complex involved in the war against Ukraine,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. &quot;The gunpowder produced here is used for various types of small arms, artillery, and rocket launchers.&quot; The plant also produces colloxylin, which is used to manufacture explosives and other products, Kovalenko added. Kuzmino-Gat lies roughly 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of the Russia-Ukraine border. Ukrainian paratroopers and other units captured 27 Russian service members during hostilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the Airborne Assault Troops&apos; press service said on Jan. 16. &quot;Among them are officers, sergeants, and privates from motorized rifle units, Marines, airborne troops, and other units, coming from various Russian regions and the occupied city of Sevastopol,&quot; the press service announced on its Telegram channel. Ukraine has been fighting in Russia&apos;s southwestern Kursk Oblast since August 2024, hoping to use its positions there as a trump card in potential negotiations with Russia. Moscow has ramped up its efforts to throw Ukraine out of its territory, deploying North Korean troops and reportedly retaking around half of the area initially taken by Kyiv. &quot;We call on other Russian soldiers not to resist and surrender!&quot; the Airborne Assault Troops&apos; press service said, promising to treat Russian prisoners of war (POW) in accordance with international humanitarian law. Only a day earlier, Ukraine&apos;s National Guard announced the capture of 23 Russian soldiers during combat operations near Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast. Ukraine and Russia regularly hold prisoner exchanges, most recently on Jan. 15 when 25 Ukrainians, including Azovstal defenders, were released. Kyiv is extending its cooperation with Norwegian defense company Kongsberg, one of the suppliers of NASAMS air defense systems to Ukraine, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Jan. 16. The defense minister met with Eirik Lie, executive vice president of Kongsberg Gruppen ASA and president of Kongsberg Defense &amp; Aerospace. The two discussed anti-drone systems and the possibility of localizing their production in Ukraine, as well as the development of maritime capabilities. Ukraine and Norway also discussed the possibility of integrating Ukrainian-made air defense systems into NASAMS &quot;to increase its effectiveness,&quot; Umerov said. The NASAMS systems have been in service with Ukrainian forces since November 2022, when the U.S. delivered the first batteries amid escalating Russian airstrikes. Ukraine has lobbied international partners for more air defense capabilities in the wake of intensifying Russian strikes targeting energy infrastructure. Norway has been one of Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters in Europe. According to Umerov, Oslo allocated 2 billion euros &#xA0;($2.1 billion) for military aid to Ukraine in 2025. The 63rd Separate Mechanized Brigade shared a video on Jan. 16 purporting to show the downing of Russian forces&apos; rare reconnaissance drone Merlin-VR. Throughout the full-scale invasion, drones have become pivotal for both Ukraine and Russia, used on and off the battlefield for attack and reconnaissance purposes. &quot;A rare bird was shot down by anti-aircraft gunners and pilots of the 63rd Brigade &#x2014; a Russian experimental Merlin-VR reconnaissance drone,&quot; the brigade&apos;s statement read. The Merlin-VR was shot down by a Ukrainian first-person-view (FPV) drone. The brigade did not specify where the air battle took place. Russian developers presented the Merlin-VR in 2021, and the Russian army has been using it on the battlefield since 2022. The drone reportedly has a hybrid engine, which reduces its noise while in motion. It can also fly for up to 10 hours and reach altitudes of up to 5 kilometers (3 miles). Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks by Ukrainian troops. Kyiv has delivered more than 200,000 domestically-produced drones to front-line units so far in December, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-uk-sign-100-year-partnership-agreement-ukrainian-drones-hit-oil-depot-gunpower-factory-in-russia/	2025-01-16T11:56:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/c31891f7d5c074d8d496bd47a146d66b_1737036022.jpeg
They are better prepared than Russians' — Ukrainian soldiers on capturing North Korean POWs	Editor&apos;s note: In accordance with the security protocols of the Ukrainian military, soldiers featured in this story are identified by first names and callsigns only. It was a month-long mission with one primary goal &#x2014; capturing a North Korean soldier alive. One of the biggest obstacles facing the Ukrainian forces tasked with the objective while operating in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast was overcoming the fanatical, suicidal zeal instilled in Pyongyang&apos;s troops. &quot;(One North Korean soldier) was about to be taken prisoner, but with the words &#x2018;Glory to the Party&apos; or &apos;Glory to Kim Jong-un,&apos; he blew himself up with a grenade,&quot; a Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces soldier with the callsign &quot;Borsuk&quot; told the Kyiv Independent. The mission eventually succeeded earlier this month with the capture of one North Korean soldier by Special Operations Forces and another one by Ukraine&#x2019;s Airborne Forces. President Volodymyr Zelensky described their capture as &quot;irrefutable evidence&quot; of Pyongyang&apos;s involvement in the Kremlin&apos;s full-scale war. According to Ukraine, North Korea has deployed around 12,000 soldiers in Kursk Oblast, where Kyiv launched a surprise cross-border incursion in August 2024. Neither Russia nor North Korea have officially acknowledged the deployment, which is the latest move in Moscow&apos;s ever-increasing &#x2014; and humiliating &#x2014; reliance on Pyongyang to bolster its military, following long-running shipments of artillery shells and ballistic missiles. &quot;Essentially, this was about conveying to the international community that third countries are indeed involved in this war. And that Russia is not as invincible as they claim,&quot; Borsuk said. The Kyiv Independent got exclusive footage of the mission, as well as interviewed Borsuk and his fellow soldier &quot;Bernard,&quot; who described how they carried out their task, the moment of capture, and why North Korean troops are far more formidable than their Russian counterparts. To prove North Korea&apos;s involvement definitively, capturing one of their soldiers alive was the only option. While Borsuk and Bernard could not disclose details of their preparation, timing, location, or the number of personnel involved in the mission, they revealed they had been monitoring a specific area in Kursk Oblast for an extended period of time, waiting for the perfect opportunity to act. The enemy group operating in the area under surveillance consisted entirely of North Koreans, according to the Ukrainian soldiers. &quot;We approached the target where we were supposed to operate. We had been observing it and knew their base positions were there,&quot; Bernard said. &quot;We started moving, and contact was made.&quot; &#xA0; Screenshot from the video showing the capturing a North Korean soldier. (Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine)A North Korean POW captured by Ukrainian forces during hostilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, as seen in a photo published on Jan. 11, 2025. (President Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)In the ensuing firefight, the enemy group took casualties and began to retreat. One wounded North Korean soldier was left behind. &quot;Our guys kept him under constant fire control to ensure he didn&apos;t move or make any sudden moves,&quot; says Borsuk. After approaching his position, disarming him was a delicate and potentially fatal maneuver. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) has previously reported that some North Korean soldiers have been forced to commit suicide to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby also earlier echoed these claims, adding that captured North Korean troops fear severe retaliation against their families if they surrender. &quot;He still had a grenade with him, in addition to his weapon, and it was very difficult to take it away,&quot; Borsuk says, describing the moment caught on headcam footage when they approached the soldier. Eventually, the North Korean soldier allowed them to get close, and they were able to provide him with first aid. Borsuk recalls their prisoner behaving &quot;calmly,&quot; and assessed he was in a stable condition. &quot;He was able to speak. The only issue he had was with his leg; everything else was normal,&quot; he says. Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces soldier, callsign &quot;Bernard,&quot; speaks with the Kyiv Independent. (Jason Blevins/The Kyiv Independent)According to Bernard, Russian artillery started firing not long after they reached the North Korean soldier, likely realizing they were trying to take him as a prisoner. &quot;(Russia&apos;s) desire to hide the presence of North Korean units was very great,&quot; Borsuk says. &quot;As (the hits) got closer and closer, he also realized what was happening&#x2026; It was clear from his eyes that he was a human; after all, he wanted to live,&quot; Bernard says. &quot;We looked at him. Well, he was just a young guy&#x2026; There were no thoughts, no desire to use physical force, or anything like that,&quot; Bernard says. &quot;We simply saved him. And that&apos;s it.&quot; The two captured North Korean POWs are currently in the custody of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) in Kyiv. Both were wounded and are reportedly receiving medical attention. One has said he was born in 2005 and began serving as a rifleman in North Korea in 2021, while the other POW was born in 1999 and has served in the North Korean army since 2016 as a sniper reconnaissance officer. Both B&#x43E;rsuk and Bernard say there are noticeable differences between the battlefield performance of North Korean and Russian soldiers. &quot;Compared to Russian soldiers, they are much better prepared physically and mentally. They are deliberately trained for where they&apos;re going and what they&apos;ll be doing,&quot; says Borsuk. &quot;It&apos;s clear that the Russians don&apos;t push themselves as hard as they do. They (North Korean soldiers) can carry heavy loads, run for long distances, and survive much better in extreme conditions.&quot; Bernard suggests they are better prepared thanks to their eight-year-long military service. However, when it comes to more &quot;complex maneuvers,&quot; the North Korean soldiers struggle to execute them effectively, he adds. &quot;&#x200B;&#x200B;Here, they can&apos;t apply everything they were trained for because the war is not the same as what they were told, or shown it would be,&quot; says Bernard. According to Bernard, North Koreans appear to be struggling to adapt to drones and aerial reconnaissance, both of which play a dominant role on the modern battlefield. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service has previously claimed that at least 300 North Korean soldiers had been killed and another 2,700 wounded fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, attributing their high casualties to the soldiers&apos; &#x201C;lack of understanding of modern warfare,&quot; including their &quot;useless&quot; attempts to shoot down long-range drones. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) reported that one of the captured North Korean POWs was carrying a Russian ID document under the name of a Tuva Republic resident. (President Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)The SBU said that one of the captured North Korean POWs was carrying a Russian ID document under the name of a Tuva Republic resident. (President Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)Borsuk believes that the ratio of killed to wounded among North Koreans is actually quite different. &quot;They have many more killed,&quot; he says, adding their coordination with the Russian units is &quot;clearly poor,&quot; partially because of the language barrier. However, the North Korean soldiers also appear to be more motivated and resilient than the Russian troops, according to Bernard. &quot;They seem very committed to their ideology. That&apos;s why they are true to their norms and what they were told about who they are and what they should do. And they simply can&apos;t do it any other way,&quot; he says. While Western officials including outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin have described Russia&apos;s use of North Korean troops as an indication of Moscow&apos;s &quot;growing desperation,&quot; Borsuk says their use could potentially shift the dynamics of the war. &quot;Imagine a battalion facing a force of up to 10,000 troops,&quot; says Borsuk. &quot;They can throw battalion after battalion into the fight, and they&apos;re not running out of personnel.&quot; This relentless tactic strains both Ukrainian soldiers and logistical support, as significant resources are required to counter such waves, according to Borsuk. &quot;These actions usually bring minimal results. However, it&apos;s not ruled out that they could deploy a larger number of troops,&quot; he says. &quot;Well, they come, die, and that&apos;s it,&quot; says Bernard. &quot;It&apos;s just that, perhaps, we should be doing a slightly different job, but instead, we&apos;re focused on eliminating them.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/they-are-better-prepared-than-russians-ukrainian-soldiers-on-capturing-north-korean-pows/	2025-01-16T11:13:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/v2_00_04_47_15_Still001.png
Fico may meet with Zelensky in 'next few days'	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico may meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the &quot;next few days,&quot; he told journalists on Jan. 16, iRozhlas reported. &quot;We are looking for another date, which should be in the next few days,&quot; Fico said when asked about a potential meeting with Zelensky. Fico did not specify where the meeting might take place. Fico had earlier offered Zelensky a meeting at the Slovak-Ukrainian border to discuss Ukraine&apos;s decision to end Russian gas transit through Ukraine. In response, the Ukrainian president invited the Slovak prime minister to Kyiv. Following Zelensky&apos;s invitation, Tibor Gaspar, deputy speaker of the Slovak Parliament, said that Fico would not be visiting the Ukrainian capital. Ukraine did not renew a pre-war agreement to transit Russian gas to Europe via Ukrainian territory, instead allowing the deal to expire on Jan. 1. Kyiv warned repeatedly that it would not extend the deal in order to stop financing Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Fico and his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban have been among some of the most vocal opponents of Ukraine&apos;s decision to stop Russian gas transit. Despite Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, Orban and Fico have continued to maintain friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting with him, and promoting pro-Russian narratives in Europe. Fico previously threatened to cut off electricity supplies to Ukraine amid increasing blackouts due to Russian attacks targeting Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure. While the EU has made efforts to reduce dependency on Russian fossil fuels following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many countries, including Slovakia and Hungary, remain reliant on Russian gas.	https://kyivindependent.com/fico-may-meet-with-zelensky-in-next-few-days/	2025-01-16T11:05:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190743977.jpg

Partners, not allies: What to expect from Russia-Iran agreement set to be signed on Jan. 17	For Moscow, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian&apos;s visit to Russia on Jan. 17 is a diplomatic victory. The trip&apos;s centerpiece will be the finalization of a long-heralded partnership deal between Russia and Iran, signed by Pezeshkian and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin. The agreement is the latest chapter in Moscow&apos;s ongoing efforts to seek out global allies and acceptance amid its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Pezeshkian and Putin will use their Moscow meeting to discuss greater cooperation in trade, transport, and logistics, as well as &quot;acute issues on the regional and international agenda,&quot; the Kremlin said on Monday. But it is the prospect of greater military cooperation between the two countries that most concern onlookers. Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine has already prompted closer ties: Moscow&apos;s troops use Iranian Shahed-type drones to bombard Ukrainian cities, while Tehran has been accused by the U.S. of giving Russia close-range ballistic missiles. Iranian officials deny the allegations. The new agreement highlights this growing military exchange. But it also comes at a time when the balance of power between Russia and Iran has shifted. Since Vladimir Putin came to power in 2000, Moscow has always held the upper hand in negotiations with Tehran. But Russia&apos;s need for arms and allies gives Iran new leverage in a changing partnership &#x2014; one that both sides hope will give them an edge. Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 left Moscow isolated on the world stage and targeted by bruising Western sanctions. Iran has been a helpful example for Russian officials on how to navigate this strange new world. Having survived for decades under its own barrage of sanctions, Iran has also been able to act as a template for Moscow. Cornerstone sanctions-busting tactics, such as using a shadow fleet of tankers to transport sanctioned oil, have been used for years by Iranian officials. Moscow has been able to adopt such templates to great effect. Their own sanctioned status also means that Iranian officials are happy to ignore Western bans on Russian trade. After almost three years of war, equipping Russia&apos;s troops in Ukraine remains a priority for the Kremlin. Iranian weapon systems are cheap and easy to make, ideal for a conflict that has seen Moscow&apos;s forces bogged down on the battlefield. An Iranian-made unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the Shahed-136, is being displayed at the Azadi (Freedom) Square during a rally in western Tehran, Iran, on Feb. 11, 2024. (Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)&quot;Iranian weapon systems are not advanced like Western or even Russian weapon systems &#x2014; but they work, and they work very effectively,&quot; says Sina Azodi, a visiting scholar and lecturer at the Institute for Middle East Studies at George Washington University. &quot;After Western sanctions on Russia that cut off the country&apos;s access to advanced microchips, the Russians learned that these more simple weapons systems would work in their favor.&quot; But it&apos;s not only Moscow that needs military technology. It&apos;s likely that Tehran also wants modern Russian weapons: something that has become particularly pressing after Israeli strikes on Iran&apos;s air defence installations in October. &quot;Iran needs a modern air force. Iran needs a modern air defense system,&quot; says Azodi. &quot;Russia is the only country that can &#x2014; and is willing &#x2014; to provide that to Iran.&quot; There is no guarantee, however, that once such promises are made that either partner will be able to deliver. Reports have repeatedly surfaced in recent years on Iran&apos;s alleged purchase of Russian Sukhoi fighter jets &#x2014; but the planes themselves have not appeared, suggesting that such deals have not been successful. While Iran&apos;s increased leverage in Moscow could help such acquisitions become a reality, the Kremlin also has other priorities to protect. &quot;Iran desperately needs a replacement for its air defense systems that the Israelis destroyed,&quot; says Azodi. &quot;But the question is whether Russia can provide it, given that it needs air defenses for its own war in Ukraine.&quot; There are also other potential sticking points between the two sides. With Moscow and Tehran both under heavy sanctions, both countries are now competing to sell goods such as oil on the same grey market. While Iran may have a longer history of using shadow tankers, ultimately, Russia&apos;s economic clout has allowed it to undercut its rivals on price. &quot;Russia and Iran have been drawn into a battle on providing discounts for oil buyers in countries such as China and India,&quot; says Arman Mahmoudian, a research fellow at the Global and National Security Institute and a faculty member at the University of South Florida. &quot;But some of these discounts are so heavy that it&apos;s very difficult for Iran to beat.&quot; A general view of the Guwahati Refinery operated by Indian Oil Corporation in Guwahati, India, on March 30, 2023. On March 29, Russian oil giant Rosneft announced a deal with Indian Oil to significantly increase oil supplies. India has become a major buyer of Russian oil since the Ukraine war. (Biju Boro / AFP via Getty Images)There are also ongoing geopolitical disagreements and rivalries. The fall of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria is a fresh wound for both Iran and Russia: in a recording that surfaced in the Iranian media in early January, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps General Behrouz Esbati accused Moscow of failing Tehran by allowing Israeli strikes on Iranian assets in Syria. He also said that the Kremlin had misled Iranian officials by claiming to strike rebel forces while, in fact, bombing empty fields. The tussle between Iranian and Russian influence in the Caucasus remains another sensitive topic. In September, Iran warned Moscow against siding with Azerbaijan in an ongoing dispute between Baku and neighboring Armenia on the placement of a land corridor to Azerbaijan&apos;s Nakhchivan enclave. &quot;Any threat from north, south, east, or west to territorial integrity of our neighbors or redrawing of boundaries is totally unacceptable and a red line for Iran,&quot; Iranian Foreign Minister Sayeed Abbas Araghchi wrote on X at the time. However, such issues can be pushed aside as both sides react to changing political tides. For now, both can use their shared agreement to push back against a common foe &#x2014; the United States. &quot;Iran sees Russia as a powerful partner to force the United States out of the Middle East. They see the United States as the main obstacle in expanding their own influence in the region,&quot; says Azodi. &quot;Russia, obviously, is a very good partner because they want the same thing.&quot; The imminent inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump will be felt keenly in both Moscow and Tehran. For Iranian officials, Trump&apos;s president comes with a sense of trepidation. Trump has consistently advocated for a harder line on Iran, as have many among his advisors. As his second term looms, it is natural for Iran to seek refuge among powers such as Russia and China, says Mahmoudian. Moscow will also be trying to make its own impression on the White House.

(Win McNamee / Getty Images)&quot;Russia wants to send a signal to the White House: we still can make things worse for you,&quot; says Mahmoudian. &quot;(The agreement signals), &apos;we understand that you are trying to take a harsher stand against Iran, but it&apos;s going to be very hard without having us on board.&quot; Yet while closer Iranian-Russia ties currently aid both countries on the global stage, this agreement could also be easily shed as world events shift. If Moscow begins peace negotiations with Ukraine, then it may distance itself from Tehran in order to win favors in Washington. &quot;Russia&apos;s top foreign policy issue is Ukraine. They want to make a favorable deal. And for that, they need to make an agreement with the Americans as Ukraine&apos;s top backers. Russia is not going to, in my view, risk or jeopardize such a deal over Iran,&quot; says Mahmoudian. Ultimately, it is these external considerations that undermine the long-term effectiveness of the Russia-Iran deal. &quot;An agreement can be game-changing or influential, but not if it&apos;s at the mercy of another third party,&quot; Mahmoudian says. &quot;The destiny of this agreement and its survival is at the mercy of the White House and the new administration.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/for-moscow-iranian-president-masoud-pezeshkians-visit-to-russia-on-jan-17-is-a-diplomatic-victory/	2025-01-16T09:29:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2177151725.jpg

How Trump could use sanctions in negotiations with Russia	In the run-up to his departure from the White House, President Joe Biden has slapped a number of major new sanctions on Russia&#x2019;s financial systems and energy sector. The U.S. originally threatened Russia with &#x201C;the mother of all sanctions&#x201D; as Moscow prepared to invade Ukraine in February 2022. Since then, Washington and its allies have gone after tens of thousands of Russian citizens and companies in a bid to eat away Russia&#x2019;s economy and stifle its war machine. The effects of the sanctions have taken time to kick in while Russia has managed to circumvent the bans, particularly on its energy sector. But proponents of sanctions say they are a crucial tool in the economic war with Moscow and point to Russia&#x2019;s stuttering economy as an example. They have also gotten under the skin of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He tried to get grain and fertilizer sanctions lifted by offering to revive the failed Black Sea grain deal in September 2023, to no avail. Ships, including those carrying grain from Ukraine and awaiting inspections, are seen anchored off the Istanbul coastline in Istanbul, Turkey on Nov. 2, 2022. (Chris McGrath/Getty Images)In less than a week, President-elect Donald Trump will take over from Biden, casting uncertainty over the future of the sanctions. Trump has not yet indicated what he will do with the sanctions. He could lift certain sanctions, impose more, or simply leave everything as it is. Experts agree, however, that Trump will follow the proposal of Keith Kellog, Trump&#x2019;s Ukraine envoy who has suggested offering Russia sanctions relief as part of potential peace agreements. Trump&#x2019;s advisors are currently preparing a sanctions strategy to pressure Moscow toward a peace deal, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 16.But any change in the sanctions regime by Washington without proper coordination with allies like the U.K. and EU could undermine their efforts to contain Russia and wind up strengthening Moscow, experts say. &#x201C;If some major energy sanctions are lifted, Russia gains revenues and improves its financial situation and starts accumulating money again to produce missiles and weapons,&#x201D; said Yuliya Pavytska, the manager of the sanctions program at the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE). Trump will not be able to wipe away all the sanctions imposed on Russia on his first day in office. The Russian sanctions fall into two camps: executive, which the president has the power to impose or repeal on his own, and statutory, which requires going through Congress. The easiest sanctions for Trump to lift will be those implemented under Biden&#x2019;s executive order, says Yuliya Ziskina, a senior legal fellow at Razom for Ukraine, a nonprofit. These include travel bans, asset freezes, the oil price cap, bans on new investments in Russia, as well as bans on imports and exports of non-essential Russian goods like vodka and seafood. &#x201C;(Trump) could also lift technology export controls, which would be a pretty big deal because a lot of (U.S.) microchips find their way into Russian missiles,&#x201D; Ziskina added. The statutory orders require a back-and-forth between Trump and Congress. Trump would have to make determinations to Congress to get approval followed by a review period where Congress can issue a joint disapproval if they want the sanctions to remain which in turn can be vetoed by Trump. But Trump&#x2019;s veto could be overruled by Congress with a two-thirds majority. Congressional approval will be needed if Trump wants to lift the REPO Act, which greenlights the confiscation of the roughly $4-5 billion in frozen Russian assets in the U.S, as well as sanctions imposed under the 2017 Countering America&apos;s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). Trump&#x2019;s main goal will be to negotiate from a position of strength, said Steven Moore, a former chief of staff in the U.S. House of Representatives and founder of Ukraine Freedom Project, an NGO. He thinks Trump could tighten up sanctions and step up enforcement to plug the loopholes. &#x201C;Trump would be better served focusing on sanctions enforcement in the first year of his term to create some pain to which Vladimir Putin might be receptive to ending,&#x201D; he said. One of the glaring issues is Russia&#x2019;s shadow fleet which negates oil and gas sanctions through a network of hundreds of tankers. Biden cracked down on the fleet last week, imposing sanctions on 183 tankers, two dodgy insurance companies, and major oil producers Gazprom Neft, which is a subsidiary of state-energy giant Gazprom, and Surgutneftegas.

(Mikhail Metzel / Pool / AFP via Getty Images)Both companies produce over 1 million barrels of oil a day and make an estimated $23 billion a year, according to the U.S. Treasury. Biden&#x2019;s recent actions also include sanctions on Gazprom Bank and 50 other banks in November 2024. Most recently on Jan. 15, he imposed sanctions and secondary sanctions on 150 Russian and non-Russian financial institutions, energy companies, enterprises supporting the Russian military, and entities involved in sanctions evasion, particularly in China. These actions could be part of the outgoing administration&#x2019;s plan to &#x201C;amass bargaining chips&#x201D; for the next administration when Trump takes over, said Taisa Markus, adjunct professor at the University of Illinois College of Law and visiting professor at Kyiv Mohyla Faculty of Law. &#x201C;Some of these new sanctions can be lifted unilaterally by a president. Others require going to Congress perhaps revealing some desire on the part of the Biden administration to ensure the incoming administration keeps up pressure on Russia,&#x201D; she said. &#xA0; &#x201C;Or if Putin doesn&apos;t do what Trump wants, Trump can sanction more. Under existing authority, there is a lot more a President can do in terms of imposing sanctions or enforcement without going to Congress,&#x201D; Markus added. Trump&#x2019;s team has shared differing views on sanctions, which could impact his decision-making. Vice President-elect JD Vance brushed off the Russian sanctions, saying they have &#x201C;gone off like a wet firecracker&#x201D; and objected to the Repo Act believing it limits the president&#x2019;s political power.Marco Rubio, Trump&#x2019;s pick for Secretary of State, backed the idea of using sanctions as leverage over Russia. &#x201C;(Sanctions) will have to be part of this conversation in terms of bringing about a peaceful resolution,&#x201D; he said, CNN reported on Jan 15. Trump&#x2019;s advisors are in the early stages of preparing a sanctions strategy, Bloomberg reported, citing sources close to the matter. This could include some relief for sanctioned oil producers if a peace deal looks likely or expanding sanctions to bolster Washington&#x2019;s position. Sanctions are only one tool in the West&#x2019;s economic war, said Moore. He thinks Trump will ramp up energy production in the U.S. and increase liquified natural gas (LNG) sales to Europe to relinquish Russia&#x2019;s grip on Europe&#x2019;s LNG market and drive down Russian prices. Trump could also broker a deal with Saudi Arabia to bring down the price of oil following Riyad&#x2019;s decision to hike production last October which would further hinder Russia&#x2019;s economy. The fossil fuel is Russia&#x2019;s lifeline and it earned 12.4 billion euros ($12.6 billion) from oil exports in December alone, according to the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). &#x201C;Anything that can increase economic pressure is something that may keep Russia from being able to fight. That&apos;s what we&apos;re looking for,&#x201D; Moore said. Lifting sanctions does not appeal to everyone, particularly in Ukraine, largely due to distrust of Putin to keep his word. In Congress, opinions are split with pro-Ukrainian politicians less likely to back lifting sanctions. &#x201C;There&apos;s a very strong argument for keeping the sanctions in place long after a peace agreement to ensure compliance,&#x201D; Markus said. Lifting sanctions means that Russia will be able to expand its revenue streams again. If Putin agrees to a ceasefire, he could bolster Russia&#x2019;s economy and war machine and attack again if there are no security guarantees in place for Ukraine, like NATO membership. &#x201C;There has to be something very big from Putin&apos;s side, like fully getting out of Ukraine. (Lifting sanctions) is definitely not worth a ceasefire, as Putin won&#x2019;t follow it,&#x201D; said KSE&#x2019;s Pavytska.

(Anatolii Stepanov/AFP via Getty Images)The consequences could be dire if Trump doesn&#x2019;t act in coordination with other partners, particularly Europe. Since the sanctions are designed to work in tandem with each other, lifting U.S. sanctions would undermine European efforts and alleviate the economic burden on Russia. This could force the EU and U.K. to bear greater responsibility and step up on their own, said Pavytska. Or it could erode unity between Ukraine&#x2019;s allies. &#x201C;&#x200A;If the U.S. is seen as regaining access to Russia&apos;s market while Europeans keep their sanctions in place and their companies don&apos;t get access to that market, they&apos;re at a competitive edge,&#x201D; said Ziskina. This may aggravate tension within Europe and embolden anti-Ukrainian factions within the EU like Hungary and Slovakia to push for sanction relief, she added. In general, Congress looks at sanctions favorably as they are perceived as costing the U.S. &#x201C;nothing,&#x201D; Ziskina said. Trump&#x2019;s administration will look at sanctions through the eyes of U.S. interests and what&#x2019;s best for them. &#x201C;It&apos;s not necessarily about helping Ukraine,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s more support for sanctions within Congress than there is for allocating a budget to Ukraine&#x2019;s defense,&#x201D; she added.	https://kyivindependent.com/heres-what-trump-could-do-with-russian-sanctions/	2025-01-16T08:39:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192427196.jpg
Trump advisers draft sanctions plan to pressure Moscow toward peace, Bloomberg reports	Advisers to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump are developing a comprehensive sanctions strategy aimed at facilitating a diplomatic resolution to the Russia-Ukraine war, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 16, citing anonymous sources familiar with the discussions. This comes as Russia&apos;s fossil fuel industry continues to serve as a primary source of funding for its war against Ukraine. The Trump team is reportedly weighing two primary approaches. The first set of policy recommendations suggests that, if a resolution to the war appears possible, the administration should focus on good-faith measures to benefit sanctioned Russian oil producers that could help seal a peace deal. The second option would involve expanding sanctions to exert maximum pressure, increasing leverage over Moscow. Trump&apos;s team is also evaluating sanctions policy options to put pressure on Iran and Venezuela, Bloomberg reported. The strategy is in its early stages and ultimately depends on what Trump decides to do, the people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. The Biden administration and the U.K. recently imposed their most extensive sanctions yet on Russia&apos;s oil sector, targeting nearly 200 vessels in the &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; key oil companies, and related entities. These measures, announced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on Jan. 10, have already impacted the global oil market, pushing Brent crude prices up by nearly $5 per barrel. The G7 nations are also considering tightening the existing $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 19. Ukraine has disrupted Russia&apos;s oil production through targeted drone strikes on key infrastructure. Refineries in Tuapse, Ilyich, and Novoshakhtinsk have reportedly reduced or suspended operations due to the combined effects of sanctions and Ukrainian attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-advisers-draft-sanctions-plan-to-pressure-moscow-toward-peace-bloomberg-reports/	2025-01-16T07:21:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192427196.jpg
UK announces new $2.6 billion aid package to Ukraine	U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a new military aid package worth $2.6 billion for Ukraine during his visit to Kyiv on Jan. 16, European Pravda reported. This visit marks Starmer&apos;s second trip to the Ukrainian capital and the first since becoming prime minister in July 2024. During the visit, Starmer and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a 100-year partnership agreement to solidify long-term cooperation. Starmer revealed that the U.K. has already provided 3 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) in military aid to Ukraine this year and pledged an additional 2.2 billion pounds ($2.6 billion), financed by interest from frozen Russian assets. The prime minister said that separate from the new aid package, the U.K. would send Ukraine 150 artillery barrels produced by Sheffield Forgemasters, the first such barrels manufactured in the U.K. in over two decades. &quot;They will start arriving in Ukraine in a few weeks,&quot; Starmer said at a press conference. The prime minister also announced the delivery of a mobile air defense system developed in collaboration with Denmark, signaling ongoing efforts to bolster Ukraine&apos;s air defense capabilities. In the days leading up to Starmer&apos;s visit, Bloomberg reported that Starmer and Zelensky were set to discuss the potential deployment of an international peacekeeping force to Ukraine during the trip.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-to-send-ukraine-artillery-barrels-air-defense-system-as-part-of-2-6b-package-funded-by-russian-assets/	2025-01-16T06:22:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193577260.jpg
North Korean troops deployed to fight for Russia learn modern warfare — albeit at heavy cost	Since December, North Korean troops have been taking part in active combat on Russia&apos;s side in the country&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine has held territory since August. This unprecedented move, made against the backdrop of a deepening Moscow-Pyongyang alliance, provided some insight into how North Korean troops fare in modern warfare. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 9 that North Korea had suffered 4,000 soldiers killed or wounded while fighting for Russia against Ukraine. A week later, South Korea&apos;s intelligence agency placed North Korean losses at 300 killed and 2,700 injured. Though these claims cannot be independently verified, experts interviewed by the Kyiv Independent for this article believe the figures to be credible. This means that up to one-third of the 12,000-strong North Korean contingent sent to aid Russia&apos;s war have been killed or injured. But despite gaps in knowledge and experience, observers acknowledge that the North Koreans have proven to be committed, even fanatical fighters. As a testament of their will to fight and die in war a continent away, Ukraine has so far managed to capture only two North Korean soldiers &#x2014; the others reportedly commit suicide or are killed by their comrades to avoid falling into captivity.

(President Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)What&apos;s behind North Korean losses?Though Ukraine reported the first limited clashes with North Korean troops in Kursk Oblast in early November 2024, full-fledged combat deployment in ground assaults can be traced to mid-December. North Korean soldiers have joined Russian efforts in retaking Ukrainian-held territory in Kursk Oblast, held since early August 2024. Since then, Kyiv&apos;s forces began churning out footage of North Korean soldiers being hunted down by FPV drones or killed by Ukrainian fire as reports of casualties mounted. Despite the training and equipment Russia provided to its new allies, North Korean troops proved ill-prepared for the realities of modern warfare, lacking the experience of their Russian and Ukrainian counterparts. &quot;North Korean troops are being &apos;consumed&apos; for front-line assaults in an unfamiliar battlefield environment of open fields, and they lack the ability to respond to drone attacks,&quot; said a South Korean official briefed by his country&apos;s intelligence agency in December. The high casualty rates can also be attributed to the &quot;human wave&quot; tactic mirroring Russian attacks in eastern Ukraine as North Korean soldiers are funneled against fortified Ukrainian defenses. The battlefield environment in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine has been especially deadly, with Russia itself suffering between 600,000-800,000 casualties throughout the full-scale invasion, according to Ukrainian sources. Speaking to the Kyiv Independent, defense expert Viktor Kevliuk said that the purpose of the North Korean contingent is to &quot;solve tactical tasks that involve a high level of losses.&quot; Similarly, White House spokesperson John Kirby noted that North Korea employs &quot;massed dismounted assaults&quot; which &quot;haven&apos;t really been that effective&quot; and result in &quot;heavy casualties.&quot; &quot;At night, small, overstretched groups (10-15 soldiers) come in, accumulate, and then enter the village from different directions,&quot; a Ukrainian soldier fighting near Sudzha told the Kyiv Independent on Jan. 6, confirming that North Korean assaults resemble the infamous &quot;human wave&quot; tactics.

(Oksana Parafeniuk for The Washington Post via Getty Images)&quot;I think these columns are entirely Koreans, they come in, and then they are replaced by Russians already in the positions they occupy.&quot; Sydney Seiler, a senior advisor at the Center of Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and former U.S. intelligence officer for North Korea, told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;cards (have been) stacked against&quot; North Korean soldiers from the beginning. &quot;And when you throw on top of that command and control language differences and just the fact that this is high casualty warfare,&quot; the current casualty rates are to be expected, the expert said. Western and Ukrainian officials nevertheless acknowledged that the &quot;indoctrinated&quot; North Korean soldiers, including elite &quot;Storm Corps&quot; units, showed high resolve and continued attacking no matter the casualties or chances of success. South Korea&apos;s intelligence agency recently said that the North Korean soldiers chose suicide rather than falling into captivity, ramping up the losses even further. A video published by Special Operations Forces of Ukraine on Jan. 13, showed Ukrainian troops taking part in active combat with allegedly North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. In one instance, the video captures a soldier fighting against Ukrainian troops committing suicide. While the deployment of North Korean soldiers is mutually beneficial to both Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, The New York Times reported that the idea came from Pyongyang. North Korea receives not only assistance for its nuclear weapons program, hard cash, and other tangible benefits but also valuable military experience. The threat of the North Korean regime acquiring a battle-hardened force adept at modern warfare has indeed become a cause for concern both in Seoul and Washington. Pyongyang &quot;is significantly benefiting from receiving Russian military equipment, technology, and experience, rendering it more capable of waging war against its neighbors,&quot; said Dorothy Camille Shea, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Special Operations Forces shared an alleged excerpt from a diary of a killed North Korean soldier that seems to confirm these concerns. &quot;I emphasize once again that the most important, vital task for our Armed Forces is readiness in the event of war,&quot; the diary reads. The goal of North Korea&apos;s involvement in Russia&apos;s war is &quot;to prepare versatile battalions that can perform any task perfectly, even at the cost of death.&quot; Indeed, it appears that the North Koreans are learning their lesson &#x2014; albeit the hard way.

(Kim Jae-Hwan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)&quot;There&apos;s evidence that they&apos;re (North Korean troops) starting to learn how to use soldiers as decoys for drones while others shoot them down,&quot; Mick Ryan, a retired Australian major general and non-resident fellow at the CSIS, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It&apos;s going to be a long, slow learning process for them, but they will learn &#x2014; those who survive &#x2014; and they&apos;ll pass those lessons on to subsequent deployments to Kursk and to their military back home in North Korea.&quot; Seiler told the Kyiv Independent that North Koreans &quot;probably engaged in military actions that are relatively simple in their complexity and become highly repetitive.&quot; &quot;They&apos;ve overcome the shock of the sudden deployment,&quot; he added. The expert nevertheless voiced skepticism about the usefulness of the gained experience unless North Korea dispatches a larger contingent. &quot;I don&apos;t really believe that unless this is a protracted contribution of troops somewhere up towards 100,000 or more (who) get experience&#x2026; that that&apos;s going to be a big payoff,&quot; Seiler said. There are signals that the initial 12,000-strong contingent might not be the last batch of reinforcements Moscow receives. Speaking to U.S. podcaster Lex Fridman, Zelensky said that North Korea could dispatch an additional 30,000&#x2013;40,000 troops to the front as Russia ramps up pressure in Kursk Oblast. On Russia&apos;s part, North Korean troops can help beef up the front in Kursk Oblast while experienced Russian forces continue pushing forward in Ukraine&apos;s east. &quot;The North Korean contingent is a discount way to increase the density of&#x2026; (Russia&apos;s) battle formations in the Kursk region,&quot; Kevliuk said, acknowledging that they are &quot;useful in this context.&quot; Putin is likely to try and squeeze Ukraine out of his home turf before Kyiv can leverage its positions there in possible peace talks this year. Russia has been steadily chipping away at Ukrainian gains in its southwestern region for the past months. A recent Ukrainian offensive appeared to have achieved only limited gains so far rather than turning the tide. As for North Korea, experts concur that both tangible and intangible benefits the country&apos;s regime receives outweigh any potential losses. &quot;Whether it&apos;s broader lessons from the war about drones and air defense, strategic coercion, information operations, whether it&apos;s about access to new technologies for its missiles and these kinds of things, there will be other kinds of returns that North Korean will be expecting,&quot; Ryan said. According to Seiler, Kim Jong Un&apos;s ambition to &quot;show himself as a leader among this new axis of upheaval&quot; and gain diplomatic benefits from his partners could be even more important than any potential battlefield experience. Western officials have warned that North Korea could grow bolder should Ukraine be defeated, with potential repercussions for the security in the Korean Peninsula and the Asia-Pacific region at large.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-koreas-troops-learn-the-lessons-of-russias-war-albeit-at-heavy-cost/	2025-01-16T05:57:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2157787216.jpg
Russian drone flew over presidential palace during Zelensky-Starmer meeting, Guardian reports	A Russian drone flew over the Mariinsky Palace in Kyiv as President Volodymyr Zelensky was meeting U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Jan. 16, The Guardian reported. The drone incursion came as Starmer arrived in Ukraine&apos;s capital on his first visit since taking office. Explosions were heard in downtown Kyiv around 12:20 p.m. local time, according to Kyiv Independent reporters. Air defense was trying to shoot down a drone as two leaders held talks, The Guardian reported. The drone was spotted and heard buzzing above the Mariinsky Palace, the presidential residence, located not far from the Presidential Office. Zelensky and Starmer held a press conference there later the same day. The unmanned aerial vehicle spotted above the palace may have been a decoy, according to The Guardian. Kyiv and London signed a wide-ranging &quot;100 Year Partnership&quot; treaty covering a number of areas, including defense, energy, trade, culture, and other sectors. &quot;We will send greetings (to Russia) too,&quot; Zelensky said at a press conference when asked about the recent Russian drone attack, Interfax-Ukraine reported. Debris from downed Russian drones fell in five districts of Kyiv, said Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the city&apos;s military administration. No casualties or fires were reported. The Pecherskyi district, where the Presidential Office is located, came under a Russian drone attack also on the morning of Jan. 1. Two people, a couple of prominent scientists, were killed, and six others were injured.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-flew-over-presidential-palace-during-zelensky-starmer-meeting-guardian-reports/	2025-01-16T05:56:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193577080.jpg
Ukrainian families of war victims can now seek compensation through The Hague's Register of Damage	The International Register of Damage for Ukraine has begun accepting applications for compensation from families who lost close relatives due to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office announced on Jan. 16. The application process for this category was delayed after a December 2024 cyberattack on Ukrainian state registers, according to a statement on the register&apos;s website. The Hague-based Register of Damage was established under the auspices of the Council of Europe in accordance with a U.N. General Assembly resolution. It marked the first step toward creating a mechanism to ensure compensation for those who suffered from the war. Claims can now be submitted for over 40 categories of harm, including deaths, torture, sexual violence, bodily harm, forced displacement, property loss, damage to infrastructure, harm to cultural and historical heritage, and environmental destruction. Ukrainians can also provide evidence of damage to or destruction of their properties, including houses and apartments. The World Bank estimates Ukraine&apos;s post-war recovery and reconstruction costs at $486 billion over a 10-year period. Meanwhile, approximately $300 billion of Russian Central Bank assets remain frozen in the West. The G7 nations pledged in October 2023 to keep these assets frozen until Moscow pays reparations to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/families-of-war-victims-can-now-seek-compensation-through-ukraines-register-of-damage/	2025-01-16T05:44:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/signal-2025-01-12-154342_008.jpeg
Ukraine, UK sign 100-year partnership agreement	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer signed a 100-year partnership agreement during their meeting in Kyiv on Jan. 16. The wide-ranging deal encompasses cooperation in military, energy, scientific, cultural, economic, and other sectors. The agreement builds upon the trade and partnership agreement signed by the two countries in 2020 and the bilateral security deal penned in January 2024. The document, published by Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office, includes 10 main pillars: &quot;(Russian President Vladimir) Putin&#x2019;s ambition to wrench Ukraine away from its closest partners has been a monumental strategic failure,&quot; Starmer said in a statement. &quot;Instead, we are closer than ever, and this partnership will take that friendship to the next level.&quot; Starmer&apos;s visit marks his second to the Ukrainian capital and the first since he was elected prime minister in July 2024. It comes as the U.K. reportedly discusses deploying an international peacekeeping force to the embattled country after a potential ceasefire. Bloomberg reported on Jan. 10 that Starmer was expected to visit Kyiv to discuss the peacekeepers&apos; potential deployment with Zelensky.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-uk-sign-100-year-partnership-agreement/	2025-01-16T05:17:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193577260.jpg
North Korean troops to join Russia’s Victory Day for the first time, media reports	North Korean soldiers will participate in Russia&#x2019;s Victory Day parade in Moscow on May 9, marking the first such instance in history, the Japanese broadcaster NHK World reported on Jan. 16, citing undisclosed Russian sources. Since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has deepened its diplomatic and military ties with North Korea. Last fall, Pyongyang sent troops to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to bolster Moscow&apos;s efforts against a Ukrainian incursion. Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov announced on Jan. 15 that military from 19 &quot;friendly&quot; countries have been invited to the Victory Day parade. NHK&apos;s sources said that tens of North Korean personnel are expected to participate in the commemoration of the victory in World War II. Kremlin foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov signaled back in December 2024 that North Korean troops might join the event. Additionally, a North Korean military band is reportedly set to perform at a music event in Moscow in late August, marking the first time North Korean military representatives will participate in such events in Russia. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico also accepted Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s invitation to attend the Victory Day celebrations in Moscow. The Kremlin heavily leverages the annual Victory Day celebrations to project military strength and propagate its narrative of Soviet heroism in World War II. Russian propaganda continues to exploit these historical victories, using them to justify its current aggression against Ukraine. Putin has framed the war as a mission to &quot;de-Nazify&quot; Ukraine, a false accusation rooted in his broader disinformation campaign.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-to-join-russias-victory-day-parade/	2025-01-16T05:06:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1074306244.jpg
Ukrainian drones hit Russian oil depot in Voronezh Oblast, military claims	Ukrainian soldiers struck the Liskinskaya oil depot in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast with drones overnight on Jan. 16, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported. According to the military, the targeted oil depot stored fuel, which was used for the needs of the Russian army. The statement came after Russian reports of the oil depot on fire in Voronezh Oblast. The village of Liski in Voronezh Oblast lies over 150 kilometers (98 miles) east of the Ukrainian border. In an attack conducted by the Special Operations Forces and other units of Ukraine&apos;s Defense Forces, at least three drones hit the facility, causing a large-scale fire, the General Staff said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The attack comes amid an uptick in Ukraine&#x2019;s drone operations targeting Russian energy infrastructure. A Ukrainian drone strike also reportedly targeted a Russian gunpowder factory in the village of Kuzmino-Gat in Tambov Oblast overnight on Jan. 16. Ukrainian forces have previously targeted military airfields, oil refineries, and ammunition depots in Voronezh Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-hit-russian-oil-depot-in-voronezh-oblast-military-claims/	2025-01-16T04:52:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2069256477.jpg
Russia claims it struck Lviv Oblast gas storage facilities; Ukraine reports no disruptions	Russia claimed it had damaged ground facilities at one of Ukraine&apos;s largest natural gas storage sites in Lviv Oblast during a series of missile and drone attacks on Jan. 15. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed the attacks were retaliation for an alleged Ukrainian strike on a gas compressor station in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar region on Jan. 11, a key point for the TurkStream pipeline, the last conduit for Russian gas to Europe. Russian attacks also occurred a day after Ukraine launched a series of strikes on Russian military and industrial facilities, including ammunition depots and refineries. Moscow has consistently targeted Ukraine&apos;s residential areas and energy infrastructure throughout the full-scale war, regardless of Ukraine&apos;s actions. Lviv Oblast officials confirmed damage to critical infrastructure in two districts but reported no casualties. The acting CEO of Ukraine&apos;s state-owned Naftogaz energy company, Roman Chumak, also confirmed that gas infrastructure was targeted but said that gas supplies were uninterrupted and repairs would be conducted swiftly. The strikes, which included Kh-101, Kh-22, and Kalibr cruise missiles, were part of a broader assault on Ukraine&apos;s energy sector. President Volodymyr Zelensky highlighted the timing and intent of the strikes, writing, &quot;It&apos;s the middle of winter, and Russia&apos;s goal remains the same: our energy sector.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha previously praised Kyiv&apos;s decision to halt Russian gas transit as a critical measure to weaken the Kremlin&apos;s leverage over Europe. Ukraine ceased the transit through its territory on Jan. 1, aiming to avoid financing Moscow&apos;s war effort.	https://kyivindependent.com/gas-storage-facilities-attack/	2025-01-16T04:45:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1240508647.jpg
You were shot. Why didn't you forgive?' Zelensky tells Fico, drawing parallels to Russian aggression	The Slovak government is playing very dangerous game by criticizing military support for Ukraine and getting closer to Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with the Polish media on Jan. 16. &quot;The Slovak leaders are playing a very dangerous game. They will continue to do so until the war reaches their own homes,&quot; Zelensky said. The comments come amid a growing rift between Ukraine and Slovakia as Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico threatened Kyiv with repercussions over its decision to halt the Russian gas transit to the EU. Fico, who visited Moscow in December to discuss gas supply issues with Russian President Vladimir Putin, has also consistently criticized military aid for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. Talking to Polish journalists, Zelensky recalled his conversation with the Slovak prime minister during a meeting of European leaders. &quot;I told him: &apos;You were shot at. Why didn&apos;t you forgive? Why did you arrest this person who injured you?&apos;&quot; Zelensky said, drawing a parallel between the Russian invasion of Ukraine and an assassination attempt on the Slovak prime minister. Fico was critically injured after being shot in the Slovak town of Handlova on May 15, 2024, following a government meeting. Slovak authorities said that the attack was politically motivated. The suspect, 71-year-old writer Juraj Cintula, has been detained and is awaiting trial. &quot;I reminded this to him (Fico) and told him that all of us, no matter your positions, condemned such steps because a living person was shot at,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;And that&apos;s Putin. He is the same; he shoots living people, albeit through the hands of others.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/you-were-shot-at-why-didnt-you-forgive-zelensky-tells-fico/	2025-01-16T04:35:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2152712934.jpg
Trump sending 'non-public messages' on war, he must force Putin to diplomacy, Zelensky says	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump can end Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with Polish media released on Jan. 16, not ruling out that it may happen in 2025. &quot;These are his (Trump&apos;s) messages, both public and non-public. And he is a capable leader to put pressure on Russia,&quot; Zelensky said. Trump is set to take office on Jan. 20. Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump promised to negotiate a swift end to the war in Ukraine, often referring to his good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to the Ukrainian president, Trump should agree on real security guarantees for Ukraine. &quot;He must force Putin to diplomacy, to end this war,&quot; Zelensky added. Trump&apos;s push for a quick end to the war has led to fears that Kyiv will be pressured into unfavorable concessions, including loss of land. About 20% of Ukrainian territory is currently under occupation by Russian forces. Some of Trump&apos;s advisors have signaled a timeline of at least several months to strike a deal to settle the Russia-Ukraine war, Reuters reported on Jan. 15.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-must-force-putin-to-diplomacy-zelensky-says/	2025-01-16T03:43:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2192427196.jpg
Russian officer jailed for accidentally shooting down own helicopter in Crimea	A Russian air defense officer stationed in occupied Sevastopol, Igor Pashkov, has been sentenced to two years and 10 months in prison for shooting down a Russian army helicopter after mistaking it for a drone, pro-government outlet Kommersant reported on Jan. 16. Russian investigative authorities charged Pashko with violations of combat duty rules, which resulted in grave consequences. The incident occurred on Dec. 18, 2023, in occupied Crimea. Pashkov, while on combat duty, received a report on what he believed to be a low-flying drone. Acting on incomplete information and failing to confirm the target&apos;s identity in time, he launched a missile salvo from a TOR-M2DT anti-aircraft system. The missile struck a Russian Mi-8 helicopter, which crashed into the Black Sea, killing the crew on board. Pashkov admitted guilt in May 2024, and the prosecution sought a seven-year sentence. In the first instance, the military court sentenced him to three years, a term later reduced by a higher court by two months. In addition to his prison sentence, Pashkov is barred from holding positions involving organizational or administrative functions in the civil service or local government for one year.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-officer-jailed-over-helicopter-downing/	2025-01-16T03:26:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1212056374.jpg
Ukraine’s Emergency Service denies claims of mass mobilization, says 90% of staff are exempt	Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service refuted claims that 50% of its employees would be mobilized, saying on Jan. 16 via Facebook that 90% of its personnel are exempt from mobilization. &quot;Every day, State Emergency Service employees rescue citizens and mitigate the consequences of Russian attacks, often at the cost of their health and lives,&quot; the agency said, urging the public to rely on verified information. The State Emergency Service clarified that rapid response units &#x2014; firefighters, sappers, rescuers, chemists, engineers, and similar specialists &#x2014; are fully exempt from mobilization to continue critical operations. This denial follows opposition MP Oleksii Honcharenko&apos;s Telegram post alleging plans for widespread State Emergency Service mobilization after Feb. 28, which the State Emergency Service labeled as misinformation. The news also comes amid reports of personnel transfers from Ukraine&apos;s Air Force to the Ground Forces, reported by Ukrainska Pravda on Jan. 14. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi allegedly had ordered the reassignment of over 5,000 Air Force personnel to address infantry shortages, particularly in Donetsk Oblast. Speaking anonymously, a senior Air Force officer warned that such transfers risk undermining unit effectiveness, especially for anti-aircraft missile systems that require highly trained and cohesive teams. The officer added that if transfers proceed as planned, some units could see staffing levels drop to 40%. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces denied these claims on Jan. 14, saying that technical and aviation personnel numbers are increasing rather than being reassigned. Ukraine has been struggling with a manpower shortage, especially in the infantry, while Russia has intensified its offensive in Donetsk Oblast since the summer of 2024. About 930,000 Ukrainians liable for military service are temporarily exempt from conscription, Forbes Ukraine reported last August. The Ukrainian government has also permitted businesses to reserve up to 50% of their employees if their enterprises are deemed critical to the economy&#x2019;s functioning.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-emergency-service-denies-claims-of-mass-mobilization-says-90-of-staff-are-exempt/	2025-01-16T03:08:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-25_09-40-25.jpg
Ukraine extends cooperation with Norwegian NASAMS systems supplier	Kyiv is extending its cooperation with Norwegian defense company Kongsberg, one of the suppliers of NASAMS air defense systems to Ukraine, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Jan. 16. The defense minister met with Eirik Lie, executive vice president of Kongsberg Gruppen ASA and president of Kongsberg Defense &amp; Aerospace. The two discussed anti-drone systems and the possibility of localizing their production in Ukraine, as well as the development of maritime capabilities. Ukraine and Norway also discussed the possibility of integrating Ukrainian-made air defense systems into NASAMS &quot;to increase its effectiveness,&quot; Umerov said. The NASAMS systems have been in service with Ukrainian forces since November 2022, when the U.S. delivered the first batteries amid escalating Russian airstrikes. Ukraine has lobbied international partners for more air defense capabilities in the wake of intensifying Russian strikes targeting energy infrastructure. Norway has been one of Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters in Europe. According to Umerov, Oslo allocated 2 billion euros &#xA0;($2.1 billion) for military aid to Ukraine in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-extends-cooperation-with-norwegian-nasams-systems-supplier/	2025-01-16T02:33:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-16_11-31-44.jpg
Russia discusses buying gas for Transnistria in Europe, media reports	Moscow and local authorities in Transnistria are discussing the possibility of purchasing gas for Moldova&apos;s Russian-occupied region on the European spot market via an intermediary company, the Russian state-controlled media outlet Kommersant reported on Jan. 15, citing unnamed sources. The costs are likely to be compensated by the Russian budget, the newspaper reported. Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom halted gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1 as Ukraine ended Russian gas transit through its territory. Gazprom claimed that it halted supplies because of Moldova&apos;s alleged unpaid debts rather than transit issues. The gas suspension has led to widespread power outages in Transnistria, pushing the region toward industrial collapse. The Russian-held region is dependent on Russian supplies while the rest of the country pivoted toward European sellers. According to Kommersant&apos;s sources, gas may be purchased from January to April in amounts of up to 3 million cubic meters per day. The outlet estimates the price at $164 million. Supplies to Tiraspoltransgaz, the largest gas provider in the region, are likely to be carried out not by Moldovagaz, which has a monopoly on supplies to Transnistria, but by another Moldovan gas supplier, Natural Gaz D.C., the outlet wrote. &#xA0; Arkady Vikol, the co-owner of Natural Gaz D.C., confirmed that his company had signed a framework contract with Tiraspoltransgaz to supply 2 to 3 million cubic meters of gas per day to Transnistria. Moldova&apos;s Security and Intelligence Service interrogated Vikol over his company&apos;s plans to organize gas supplies to Transnistria, Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean said. Russia will resume gas supplies to Transnistria in the form of humanitarian aid, said Vadim Krasnoselsky, the head of the Moscow-controlled region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-discusses-buying-gas-for-transnistria-in-europe-media-reports/	2025-01-16T02:08:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1686320111-1.jpg
Ukrainian paratroopers capture 27 Russian soldiers in Kursk Oblast	Ukrainian paratroopers and other units captured 27 Russian service members during hostilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the Airborne Assault Troops&apos; press service said on Jan. 16. &quot;Among them are officers, sergeants, and privates from motorized rifle units, Marines, airborne troops, and other units, coming from various Russian regions and the occupied city of Sevastopol,&quot; the press service announced on its Telegram channel. Ukraine has been fighting in the southwestern Kursk Oblast since August 2024, hoping to use its positions there as a trump card in potential negotiations with Russia. Moscow has ramped up its efforts to throw Ukrainian out of its territory, deploying North Korean troops and reportedly retaking around half of the area initially taken by Kyiv. &quot;We call on other Russian soldiers not to resist and surrender!&quot; the Airborne Assault Troops&apos; press service said, promising to treat Russian prisoners of war (POW) in accordance with international humanitarian law. Only a day earlier, Ukraine&apos;s National Guard announced the capture of 23 Russian soldiers during combat operations near Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast. Ukraine and Russia regularly hold prisoner exchanges, most recently on Jan. 15 when 25 Ukrainians, including Azovstal defenders, were released.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-paratroopers-capture-27-russian-soldiers-in-kursk-oblast/	2025-01-16T01:44:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Prisoners.png
Italy's Defense Minister Crosetto arrives in Kyiv on official visit	Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto arrived in Kyiv on Jan. 16 for a &quot;series of institutional meetings,&quot; Italy&apos;s Defense Ministry announced. Crosetto arrived in Kyiv on the same day as U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is in the Ukrainian capital to sign a &quot;100 Year Partnership&quot; agreement and discuss further cooperation with President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Italian ministry did not reveal who is Crosetto expected to meet or the topic of the discussions. The European officials are visiting Ukraine mere days before the start of Donald Trump&apos;s presidency, which could have a major impact on the progress of the Russia-Ukraine war. Trump has pledged to push both sides to the negotiating table and reportedly backed the idea of European partners deploying peacekeepers to monitor a potential ceasefire. Crosetto previously voiced support for the idea, suggesting Italy is open to joining the peacekeeping mission. Starmer is also expected to discuss the topic with Zelensky during his visit. Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, Italy has delivered 10 military aid packages, including advanced SAMP/T air defenses, to Ukraine. The country&apos;s cabinet recently approved the extension of the assistance for Ukraine throughout 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/italys-defense-minister-crosetto-arrives-in-kyiv-on-official-visit/	2025-01-16T01:14:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/808eccb3-7186-4cfb-83f3-59e9cc1f33b1.jpeg
Ukraine is still free' — Biden touts his admin's accomplishments in farewell speech	Outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden briefly mentioned Ukraine during his farewell speech on Jan. 15, saying his administration helped to preserve the country&apos;s freedom. &quot;Ukraine is still free, and we&#x2019;ve pulled ahead of our competition with China and so much more,&quot; the U.S. president said as he listed his administration&apos;s accomplishments, including stronger NATO. Biden ends his first and only four-year term on Jan. 20, to be succeeded by former President Donald Trump. The Biden administration has provided $65.9 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, making it Kyiv&apos;s largest donor. &quot;It will take time to feel the full impact of what we&#x2019;ve done together. But the seeds are planted, and they&#x2019;ll grow, and they&#x2019;ll bloom for decades to come,&quot; Biden said. Despite the provided support, the Biden administration has often attracted criticism for its self-restricting and hesitant approach, with many key military capabilities being greenlighted only after prolonged pressure. Before winning his reelection, Trump had criticized the military aid for Ukraine and pledged to cut a swift deal to end the war and get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the conflict. This sparked concerns that the incoming U.S. president could reduce defense aid or push Kyiv toward a painful peace deal. Trump and his team later signaled that they do not plan to abandon Ukraine, though Secretary of State nominee Marc Rubio said Kyiv would have to make concessions to achieve a ceasefire. Russia continues to occupy roughly one-fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory while its forces are pushing forward in Donetsk Oblast. In turn, Ukrainian forces hold on to a piece of Russian territory in Kursk Oblast, which is seen as a potential trump card in expected talks. Both Kyiv and Moscow face mounting challenges connected to the full-scale war, with Ukraine dealing with manpower shortages and Russia with a struggling economy.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-is-free-biden-stresses-in-farewell-speech/	2025-01-16T00:31:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193228711.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 4, injure 27 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed four people and injured at least 27 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Jan. 16. Ukrainian forces downed 34 out of 55 drones, including Shahed-type ones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Another 18 were &quot;lost,&quot; it added. Debris from downed drones damaged energy infrastructure in Poltava Oblast, leaving hundreds of people without power, the local military administration said. Russian attacks on the town of Nikopol in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast killed a 54-year-old woman and injured a 45-year-old man, according to Governor Serhii Lysak. The attack damaged around 30 houses, five high-rise buildings, industrial enterprises, and cars, he added. A total of 15 people were injured in the town of Kramatorsk and the villages of Kostiantynopil, Oleksiievo-Druzhkivka, Stinky, and Chernihivka in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. A Russian drone attack on the town of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast injured a 73-year-old man, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 36 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Three people were killed and 10 were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-4-injure-27-over-past-day/	2025-01-16T00:00:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/photo_2025-01-15_16-09-03.jpg
Ukraine blows up mine shaft to hamper Russian advance to Pokrovsk, NYT reports	Ukraine blew up the No. 3 mine&apos;s shaft in the village of Pishchane in Donetsk Oblast to prevent Russia from deploying its troops closer to the front-line town of Pokrovsk, The New York Times (NYT) reported on Jan. 15, citing miners. According to the Ukrainian miners, at some point, the shaft, located southeast of Pokrovsk, became too dangerous to work in due to constant Russian attacks. They switched to descending into the mine through another shaft. Pokrovsk, a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian forces, has been the focus of fierce fighting as Russia intensifies its offensive in Donetsk Oblast. In the meantime, Russian troops advanced to within a mile of mine No. 3, raising fears that they could seize it and use its tunnels to outflank Ukraine&apos;s positions, according to the NYT. The miners and Ukrainian soldiers began drilling holes under the shaft to plant explosives, several workers told the outlet. The shaft was blown up around Dec. 20, 2024. Keeping the mine operational as long as possible was crucial to the Ukrainian economy, as it produced coking coal required for steelmaking &#x2014; Ukraine&apos;s second-largest export after agriculture. An unnamed manager at Metinvest, Ukraine&apos;s largest steel producer, told the NYT that explosives were also planted in the facility&#x2019;s two other shafts located further west, near the Ukraine-controlled villages of Kotlyne and Udachne. It is unknown whether they have been detonated. Earlier this month, Metinvest announced it had suspended operations at the Pokrovsk coking coal mine in Donetsk Oblast due to worsening security conditions and power outages. Steel exports generated nearly $2 billion in the first eight months of 2024, with production projected to reach 7.5 million metric tons by year-end. Plans to increase output to over 10 million tons in 2025 are now threatened, as the loss of Pokrovsk could slash annual production to 2-3 million tons, according to Reuters.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-blows-up-shaft-in-pokrovsk-nyt/	2025-01-15T23:33:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2184979920.jpg
Ukraine hopes to open all 6 negotiating clusters on EU accession in 2025, Zelensky says	Ukraine has the &quot;ambitious goal&quot; to open five or six EU accession negotiation clusters in 2025, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 15. Ukraine applied for EU membership at the onset of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. The country has made quick progress, achieving candidate status within months, with the initial negotiations formally launching in June 2024. Ukraine will open two or three negotiation clusters in the first six months of 2025 under Poland&apos;s rotating presidency, Zelensky said during his official visit to Warsaw. Poland will lead the EU Council&apos;s presidency for six months from January, and Denmark will take over the role in July. Ukraine aims to open three more negotiation clusters in the second half of 2025 under the Danish chairmanship, the president noted. &quot;We have an ambitious goal to open five to six clusters. In principle, we can open them all this year, if we succeed. We will try to do it all,&quot; Zelensky said. There are six accession negotiation clusters, consisting of several individual chapters. Negotiations prepare a candidate country to become an EU member. The EU&#x2019;s Commissioner for Enlargement, Oliver Varhelyi, said that Ukraine could potentially join the bloc by 2029 if it successfully implements necessary reforms. EU membership, alongside continued weapons shipments and NATO accession, are among the key security guarantees for Ukraine, Zelensky said on Jan. 15 as his country continues to face Russian aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-eu-negotiations/	2025-01-15T23:20:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190061070.jpg
Ukrainian drone strike reportedly targets gunpowder factory in Russia's Tambov Oblast	A Ukrainian drone strike targeted a Russian gunpowder factory in the village of Kuzmino-Gat in Tambov Oblast overnight on Jan. 16, local Telegram channels and a Ukrainian official claimed. Eyewitnesses in the nearby city of Kotovsk heard the sound of a drone engine as it was passing over their houses, presumably heading to the factory, the Shot Telegram channel reported. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed its forces downed 27 Ukrainian drones over various regions overnight, including three in Tambov Oblast. The same night, a Russian oil depot in Voronezh Oblast reportedly caught fire as a result of the drone attack. Russian authorities said there were no casualties as a result of the attack in Tambov Oblast and that the roof of a house was damaged by drone debris. It is not immediately clear whether the plant suffered any damage due to the attack. The Kuzmino-Gat gunpowder factory is &quot;one of the key facilities of the Russian military-industrial complex involved in the war against Ukraine,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. &quot;The gunpowder produced here is used for various types of small arms, artillery, and rocket launchers.&quot; The plant also produces colloxylin, which is used to manufacture explosives and other products, Kovalenko added. Kuzmino-Gat lies roughly 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of the Russia-Ukraine border. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. The news comes amid Ukraine&apos;s escalating drone campaign targeting Russian military and industrial facilities in the rear. Kyiv launched one of its most massive long-range attacks on Jan. 14, successfully striking refineries, chemical plants, and ammunition depots, including a distillery in Novaya Lyada in Tambov Oblast. The Kuzmino-Gat gunpowder factory was previously struck by Ukrainian drones in July 2024, a military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent at the time.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drone-strike-reportedly-targets-gunpowder-factory-in-russias-tambov-oblast/	2025-01-15T22:58:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1604726426.jpg

UK PM Starmer makes surprise visit to Kyiv, will sign '100 Year Partnership' with Ukraine	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in Kyiv on Jan. 16 amid an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian capital, where Starmer is set to sign a wide-ranging &quot;100 Year Partnership&quot; treaty, covering a number of areas including defense, energy, and trade. Starmer&apos;s visit marks just his second trip to the Ukrainian capital, and the first since he was elected prime minister in July 2024. &quot;This is not just about the here and now, it is also about an investment in our two countries for the next century, bringing together technology development, scientific advances and cultural exchanges, and harnessing the phenomenal innovation shown by Ukraine in recent years for generations to come,&quot; Starmer said in a news release on the treaty. Starmer&apos;s visit to Ukraine comes as the U.K. continues to discuss the potential deployment of an international peacekeeping force to the embattled country ahead of potential peace negotiations. Bloomberg reported on Jan. 10 that Starmer was expected to visit Kyiv in the coming weeks to further discuss with Zelensky the peacekeepers&apos; potential deployment. Donald Trump has also advocated for Europe to take the lead in monitoring a potential ceasefire. The Wall Street Journal reported on Dec. 12 that Trump emphasized Europe&#x2019;s greater responsibility in addressing Russian aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-pm-starmer-make-surprise-visit-to-kyiv-will-sign-100-year-partnership-with-ukraine/	2025-01-15T21:54:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2160310001.jpg
Members of Trump's team admit Ukraine-Russia peace settlement could take months, Reuters reports	Several advisors to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump have accepted a timeline of several months to strike a deal to settle the Russia-Ukraine war, Reuters reported on Jan. 15, citing two Trump associates who directly spoke to president-elect about the war. Trump has previously promised to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine in 24 hours. As Trump&apos;s inauguration approaches, Keith Kellogg Trump&apos;s choice for special Ukraine peace envoy has said the Trump administration aims to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine within 100 days after inauguration. Trump&apos;s campaign promise to end the war in a day was a lack of appreciation for intractability of the conflict due to its complexity, and did not consider how long it would take to staff a new administration, the two Trump associates said. Trump has voiced readiness to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to begin the process of establishing a potential peace agreement. Kellogg is also slated to meet with Ukrainian officials following Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20, and will also visit other European capitals to discuss the war. Trump has called for more European leadership to end the war, including the potential of European peacekeepers. Marco Rubio, Trump&apos;s pick for secretary of state, said on Jan. 15 that both sides need to be &quot;realistic,&quot; in a potential ceasefire agreement. Rubio suggested a concession from Russia would be to not advance any further, while Ukraine&apos;s concession would be to give its territories currently under Russian occupation. Previously, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the U.S. can not approach peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia as a neutral mediator, and recognize Russia as an aggressor.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-team-admits-ukraine-peace-settlement-could-take-months-reuters-reports/	2025-01-15T20:59:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-643210102.jpg
NATO, EU membership, military strength are strategic security guarantees for Ukraine, Zelensky says	NATO and EU membership, as well as the country&apos;s own military strength are key security guarantees for Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at a press conference alongside Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Jan. 15. With U.S. President-elect Donald Trump set to take office in days, Zelensky and European allies are preparing for a potential shift in U.S. foreign policy, including a proposed ceasefire and peace negotiations. &quot;We want to end the war with a just peace, but for that, we need to be sure that Russia will not return to wage war against Ukraine. We need strong security guarantees,&quot; Zelensky said. Continued weapons shipments, NATO accession, and EU membership are key security guarantees, Zelensky said, noting that the country cannot engage in &quot;games&quot; reducing the size of its military. Ahead of potential peace negotiation, a large military was &quot;the only security guarantee,&quot; Zelensky added. Zelensky&apos;s comment on the size of Ukraine&apos;s military come as Russian President Vladimir Putin is set demand that Ukraine cut its ties with NATO and become &quot;a neutral state with a limited military&quot; during upcoming talks with Donald Trump, Bloomberg reported. Zelensky touted the size of Ukraine&apos;s military during the press conference, stating that the country&apos;s military now comprises 880,000 soldiers, tasked with defending the entire country against 600,000 Russian troops concentrated in specific areas. Ukrainian officials are expected to meet with members of Trump&apos;s administration shortly after his inauguration on Jan. 20 to discuss the details of peace negotiations. Despite unease over Trump&apos;s stance on Ukraine, there have been reports that European allies have grown optimistic Trump will not abandon Ukraine. Trump met with Zelensky during his election campaign and a second time following his U.S. presidential election victory on Dec. 7 on the sidelines of the Notre Dame Cathedrals re-opening in a trilateral meeting with Macron. Trump has voiced he is ready to meet with Putin once he takes office to spearhead peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, a move Ukraine and European allies are approaching cautiously.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-and-eu-membership-are-strategic-security-guarantees-for-ukraine/	2025-01-15T19:28:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193453413.jpg
US sanctions Russian entity operating occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant	The U.S. Department of the Treasury on Jan. 15 sanctioned Russia&apos;s Federal State Unitary Enterprise Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, a Moscow-created entity that took control of Ukraine&apos;s Zaporizhzhia power plant in the partially occupied oblast. The updated sanctions list also targets Vladislav Isaev, the company&#x2019;s CEO since April 2024. In October 2022, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin signed a decree establishing the Russian entity to oversee the captured power plant. This followed an order from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who declared the facilities of the Ukrainian nuclear power plant as Russian federal property. Russian forces have occupied the Zaporizhzhia plant, the largest nuclear station in Europe, since March 2022, and have been using the site in ways that increase the risk of a nuclear disaster. Throughout its occupation, the plant has been repeatedly disconnected from the Ukrainian power grid due to Russian attacks on the country&apos;s energy infrastructure. The region, particularly the city of Zaporizhzhia and the areas around the nuclear power plant, has endured regular missile strikes, artillery shelling, and drone attacks. On Jan. 8, Russian forces targeted an industrial facility in Zaporizhzhia, killing 13 people and injuring 122, including a child, according to State Emergency Service.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-sanctions-russian-entity-operating-occupied-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant/	2025-01-15T17:39:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1249892066.jpg

Oil depot on fire in Russia's Voronezh region	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. An oil depot in Russia&apos;s Voronezh region caught fire following multiple drone strikes, regional governor Alexander Gusev said on Jan. 15. No casualties were reported, according to Gusev. The Kyiv Independent is unable to immediately verify the reports. Voronezh is located approximately 465 kilometers (289 miles) south of Moscow. The attack comes amid an uptick in Ukraine&#x2019;s drone operations targeting Russian energy infrastructure. Overnight on Jan. 14, Ukraine carried out its &quot;most massive&quot; strike on Russian military and industrial facilities within a range of up to 1,100 kilometers (620 miles), according to the General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces. Targets included chemical plants, refineries, and ammunition depots at the Engels airbase, a source in Ukraine&#x2019;s Security Service (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent. In response, Russia has continued missile strikes on Ukraine&#x2019;s already battered energy network. On Jan. 15, explosions were reported in several Ukrainian oblasts. In Lviv Oblast, &#xA0;Andriy Sadovyi, city mayor, said Russian forces had &quot;attacked the energy infrastructure of our region and Ukraine.&quot; Later in the morning, Lviv Oblast officials said critical infrastructure facilities had been hit in two districts of the oblast but added there were no casualties.	https://kyivindependent.com/oil-depot-on-fire-in-russias-voronezh-region/	2025-01-15T13:35:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1342639538.jpg
Putin to demand Ukraine never join NATO during talks with Trump, Bloomberg reports	Russia will demand that Ukraine cut its ties with NATO and become &quot;a neutral state with a limited military&quot; during talks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 15, citing its sources. Trump has previously signaled that he is ready to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;very quickly&quot; following his inauguration, adding that the Kremlin is also seeking it. Trump has repeatedly reiterated that he plans to end the war in Ukraine swiftly, in part because he allegedly has good ties with Putin. The Kremlin reportedly accepts that individual NATO member states can continue to send weapons to Ukraine as part of bilateral security agreements, but the weapons &quot;should not be used against Russia or to recapture territory,&quot; one of the sources told Bloomberg. Moscow&apos;s position is that it will de facto retain control over almost 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory, including the Crimean peninsula, annexed in 2014. In the meantime, Russia is allegedly open to exchange some territories, the media outlet reported, citing its sources. Kyiv and Moscow are currently holding talks only on the exchange of prisoners and the return of deported children, Ukrainian officials told the media outlet on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, Ukraine and Russia are also having &quot;limited talks&quot; in Qatar on the rules for protecting nuclear facilities from attacks, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the Kremlin&apos;s preparations. Trump has often voiced sympathies for the Russian leader while criticizing the level of support the outgoing Biden administration threw behind Kyiv. This prompted concerns that the new U.S. leadership might cut a deal unfavorable to Ukraine. Trump&apos;s incoming peace envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said that the president-elect&apos;s aim is not to &quot;give something to Putin or the Russians&quot; but to &quot;save Ukraine and save their sovereignty.&quot; Trump said that specific peace proposals are still being worked out. A pitch leaked from his team &#x2014; freezing the front lines, postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession by 20 years, and deploying European peacekeepers on the ground &#x2014; has already been rejected by Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-to-demand-ukraine-never-join-nato-during-talks-with-trump-bloomberg-reports/	2025-01-15T12:17:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2160580179.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine's military now totals 880,000 soldiers, facing 600,000 Russian troops, Kyiv claims	Key developments on Jan. 15: President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 15 that Ukraine&apos;s military now comprises 880,000 soldiers, tasked with defending the entire country against 600,000 Russian troops concentrated in specific areas. Speaking at a joint press conference with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk in Warsaw, Zelensky said that Russia&apos;s localized troop concentration creates a numerical advantage. &quot;Russian troops are concentrated in several areas, so in some areas, they have a quantitative advantage,&quot; he said. Ukraine has been struggling with a manpower shortage, especially in the infantry, while Russia has intensified its offensive in Donetsk Oblast since the summer of 2024. Earlier on Jan. 14, a scandal erupted in Ukraine as Air Force members claimed they were being transferred to bolster the infantry. According to Ukrainska Pravda, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi issued an order on Jan. 11 to transfer over 5,000 Air Force personnel to Ground Forces units. A senior Air Force officer, speaking anonymously, said transfers began in spring 2024 and have now reached a &quot;critical level,&quot; with unit staffing dropping to 50%. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces denied claims of transferring technical and aviation personnel, saying that these resources are being increased. Critics have called for deeper mobilization reforms, as Ukraine&apos;s army faces challenges related to demographics and an uneven mobilization process. In 2024, Ukraine lowered its minimum mobilization age from 27 to 25 but resisted calls from international partners to reduce it further to 18. Zelensky also reported progress in arms production, saying that Ukraine now covers 33-34% of its annual weapons needs &#x2014; up from less than 10% before the full-scale invasion. Europe and the U.S. supply more than 60% of Ukraine&apos;s weaponry, with each accounting for about 30%. Russia launched a large-scale missile attack against Ukraine on the morning of Jan. 15, using Kh-101, Kh-22, and Kalibr cruise missiles, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported. The Russian Defense Ministry had previously threatened to retaliate after Ukraine targeted military and industrial sites throughout Russia in a mass attack on Jan. 14. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force issued a nationwide aerial alert in the early hours of Jan. 15, following warnings that a group of Tu-95MS strategic bombers had taken flight from Russia&apos;s Olenya airfield in Murmansk Oblast. Russia also reportedly launched ballistic missiles from Belgorod Oblast. Explosions were reported in Kharkiv, Khmelnytsky Oblast, and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. In Lviv Oblast, Lviv Mayor Andrii Sadovyi said Russian forces had &quot;attacked the energy infrastructure of our region and Ukraine.&quot; Later in the morning of Jan. 15, officials in Lviv Oblast said critical infrastructure facilities had been hit in two districts of the oblast but added there were no casualties. There was no information on what was hit or the extent of the damage caused. Svitlana Onyshchuk, head of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast Military Administration, said the attacks had targeted &quot;critical infrastructure facilities&quot; in the oblast but had not caused any casualties. No further details were provided. Ukraine&apos;s state grid operator, Ukrenergo, imposed emergency blackouts as a preventative measure, Energy Minister Herman Haluschenko announced. &quot;It&apos;s the middle of winter, and the target for the Russians remains the same: our energy sector,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on his Telegram channel later in the morning on Jan. 15. &quot;More than 40 missiles were involved in this strike, including ballistic missiles. At least 30 were destroyed. There were also more than 70 Russian attack drones overnight,&quot; he added. &quot;We constantly need to strengthen the existing capabilities of the Ukrainian air shield. Our partners at the NATO summit in Washington and in the Ramstein format made promises that have not yet been fully realized.&quot; Shortly after eight in the morning, the all-clear was given across much of the country. Poland scrambled fighter jets due to the Russian missile threat in western Ukraine, according to the Polish Operational Command. Both Ukraine and Russia will have to make concessions to end the war, Marco Rubio, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s pick for secretary of state, said on Jan. 15 at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Rubio called on everyone to be realistic, suggesting that Russia&apos;s concession would be to not advance any further, while Ukraine&apos;s concession would be to give its territories currently under Russian occupation. &quot;It is important for everyone to be realistic: There will have to be concessions &#x2014; made by the Russian Federation, but also by the Ukrainians&#x2026; It is also important that there be some balance on both sides,&quot; Rubio said. Since invading Ukraine in 2014 and escalating its war of aggression in 2022, Russia has occupied about 20% of Ukrainian territory, imposing repressive measures on the local population and prohibiting any expressions of Ukrainian identity. Ukraine has repeatedly said it would not recognize its territory currently under Moscow&apos;s control as Russian. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, repeatedly pledged during his election campaign to negotiate a swift end to the war after taking office. However, he has never elaborated on how exactly he plans to achieve that. &quot;There is no way Russia takes all of Ukraine. The Ukrainians are too brave and fight too hard, and the country is too big. That&apos;s not gonna happen,&quot; Rubio said. &quot;It is also unrealistic to believe that somehow a nation the size of Ukraine&#x2026; gonna push these people (Russian troops) all the way back to where they were on the eve of the invasion,&quot; he added. According to Rubio, the U.S. must not allow Russian President Vladimir Putin to return to his plans to take over Ukraine in four or five years. Rubio publicly praised the bravery of Ukrainian defenders but was among the 15 Republican lawmakers in the Senate who voted against the $61 billion aid package for Ukraine, which was eventually passed in April 2024. Rubio did not support President Joe Biden&apos;s administration&apos;s policy regarding assistance to Ukraine, as, according to him, the White House &quot;has never been clear about how this conflict will end.&quot; The 53-year-old Florida Senator will replace Antony Blinken in the position, and as the top U.S. diplomat, he would be at the forefront of potential peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. Ukraine managed to bring back 25 Ukrainians from Russian captivity, including Azovstal defenders, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Jan. 15. &quot;Returning our people home is something that Ukraine is constantly working on. And we will not stop until we bring all of our people back,&quot; Zelensky said in a post on Telegram. The returning Ukrainian POWs were captured during the defense of Mariupol and its Azovstal steel plant, as well as during the defense of other key areas of the front line in Kharkiv, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, Zelensky added. He said some of those brought back have serious injuries and illnesses. The exchange was conducted on a 25 for 25 basis. In a recent agreement, Russia and Ukraine agreed to prioritize wounded POWs at the selection of exchanges, followed by those held longest in captivity. President Zelensky also expressed his gratitude to the United Arab Emirates for mediating between the parties. Over the past year, Ukraine conducted 11 prisoner exchanges and secured the return of 356 more people than in 2023. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Nearly 4,000 people have been released, including 1,358 in 2024. Vilnius would consider deploying troops to Ukraine with its allies in the future if Kyiv were to make such a request, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys told LRT TV on Jan. 14. The proposal for an international peacekeeping force has gained traction recently, as European nations prepare to take a more prominent role in Ukraine&apos;s defense when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Budrys said that Lithuania did not rule out such possibilities which were touted at a summit in Paris last year when French President Emmanuel Macron invited Lithuania&apos;s president and others to explore expanded military involvement in Ukraine. &quot;Lithuania is a security provider in the region, not just a recipient,&quot; Budrys said. &quot;If the question arises, I have no doubt that the Lithuanian flag will be there.&quot; &quot;We&apos;d talk with our allies and partners about what it looks like, and we&apos;d talk with Ukraine about what it looks like,&quot; he added. Macron has championed the idea of deploying European troops in Ukraine since early 2024. President Volodymyr Zelensky and Macron discussed the possibility during a meeting on Dec. 18, and Macron raised the proposal again during a trilateral meeting with Trump on Dec. 7. Trump reportedly expressed interest in European-led ceasefire monitoring. On Jan. 13, Zelensky and Macron held a phone call to discuss Ukraine&apos;s air defense priorities and the possible deployment of peacekeepers. Both leaders agreed to meet soon to advance plans for securing guarantees for Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is also expected to visit Ukraine in the coming weeks to discuss the peacekeeping initiative, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 10. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk advocated for increased defense spending across NATO on Jan. 15, arguing that if all European members matched Poland&apos;s spending, NATO&apos;s defense budget would be ten times that of Russia&apos;s. &quot;No one but Europe will solve its defense problems,&quot; he said during a joint press conference with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Warsaw. Tusk&apos;s comment comes amid growing calls for higher defense spending across NATO, a topic reignited by Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and advocated for by incoming U.S. President Donald Trump. &quot;Other countries should not pay 1.5 percent of their GDP for defense &#x2014; this is not enough,&quot; he said, emphasizing that robust European defense contributions could help maintain friendly U.S.-European relations. On Jan. 7, Trump called for NATO&apos;s spending target to rise to 5% of GDP, significantly higher than the current 2% goal. &quot;If all European countries start taking their obligations in NATO seriously, I am sure America will be happy to cooperate with us,&quot; Tusk added. While the 5% suggestion has faced resistance, some NATO members are reportedly open to a more modest increase, potentially to 3% of GDP, Reuters reported on Jan. 10. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte quipped on Jan. 13 that allies should increase spending or prepare to &quot;take Russian language courses or move to New Zealand.&quot; Currently, 24 out of 32 NATO countries meet the 2% GDP target, but several, including Italy, Canada, and Spain, fall short. Zelensky praised his discussions with Tusk, highlighting their focus on bolstering Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities and advancing sanctions against Russia. &quot;We discussed our defense, including the supply of weapons, weapons production, and related investments. We also focused on strengthening sanctions against Russia and bringing peace closer for Ukraine and all of Europe,&quot; Zelensky said on X.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraines-military-now-totals-880-000-soldiers-facing-600-000-russian-troops-kyiv-claims/	2025-01-15T12:12:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2190608033.jpg
Ukraine, Russia have to make concessions to end war, Rubio says	Both Ukraine and Russia will have to make concessions to end the war, Marco Rubio, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s pick for secretary of state, said on Jan. 15 at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

US targets China-Russia sanctions evasion scheme with new measures	The U.S. Treasury Department has targeted actors involved in a sanctions evasion scheme facilitating cross-border payments for sensitive goods between China and Russia as part of a new package of sanctions, according to a Jan. 15 announcement. The U.S. Treasury imposed new sanctions on a total of over 150 entities and individuals, including companies in Russia&#x2019;s defense industry and those supporting it, as well as dozens of entities across multiple countries that help Russia evade U.S. sanctions. The Treasury also expanded measures against almost 100 entities already under sanctions for their cooperation with Russia&#x2019;s military-industrial complex. &quot;Today&apos;s actions frustrate the Kremlin&apos;s ability to circumvent our sanctions and get access to the goods they need to build weapons for their war of choice in Ukraine,&quot; said Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Wally Adeyemo. Moscow and Beijing set up regional clearing platforms (RCPs) in both Russia and China to act as counterparties for cross-border payments for sensitive goods. This allows for non-cash mutual payments for sanctioned goods, according to the Treasury. The Russian-Chinese scheme involves Russian financial institutions on the U.S. sanctions list, such as Public Joint Stock Company Sberbank of Russia, Joint Stock Company Alfa-Bank, Open Joint Stock Company Sovcombank, T-Bank, and Limited Liability Company Bank Tochka. The sanctions also target OJSC Keremet Bank, based in Kyrgyzstan, which has been coordinating with Russian officials and Promsvyazbank, a Russian bank under U.S. sanctions, to evade sanctions since the summer of 2024. In 2024, the Kyrgyz Finance Ministry sold a controlling stake in Keremet Bank to a firm closely linked to Russian-Moldovan oligarch Ilan Shor, who has ties to the Russian government. The purchase of Keremet Bank was intended to create a hub for circumventing sanctions through which Russia could pay for imports and receive payments for exports, according to the statement. The new sanctions also target 20 Russian energy companies and over 30 organizations and institutions from the defense and related sectors. Earlier on Jan. 10, the U.S. and U.K. imposed broad sanctions against the Russian oil industry, taking aim at Moscow&apos;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet.&quot; The restrictions targeted nearly 200 vessels, along with Russian oil companies and industry officials. President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the sanctions as a &quot;significant blow to the financial foundation of Russia&apos;s war machine.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-targets-china-russia-sanctions-evasion-scheme-with-new-measures/	2025-01-15T11:16:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1781860144.jpg
Will Europe put ‘boots on the ground’ for peace in Ukraine? We asked top Nordic, Baltic officials	Just days out from the return of Donald Trump to the White House, the future of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine is dominated by a great unknown: whether the incoming president will manage to push Moscow to stop its advance on the battlefield, or whether he will disengage and perhaps abandon U.S. support for Ukraine entirely. Either way, one thing is clear: the war cannot come to an end with a secure Ukraine without Europe playing a braver role. The chance of the guns and drones going silent across Ukraine in 24 hours after Trump takes office &#x2014; as Trump had frequently promised on the campaign trail &#x2014; is slim to none. Nonetheless, amid consistent rhetoric from Washington that Europe must up defense spending and take more responsibility for their continent&#x2019;s security, European countries are faced with an urgent task: taking the braver steps to secure Ukraine against a bullish Moscow seemingly more convinced in its forthcoming victory than at any time since February 2022. In a new reality far removed from the war of 2022, the catch phrase going into 2025 is now &#x201C;boots on the ground.&#x201D; The first serious floating of the idea of European troops entering Ukrainian territory came from French President Emmanuel Macron in the spring of 2024. &#x201C;In fact, many countries said that in the weeks that followed that they understood our approach, that they agreed with our position and that this position was a good thing.&#x201D; French soldiers with the 1st Infantry Regiment fire mortars near Rena, Norway, during Exercise Brilliant Jump 2022, on March 17, 2022. The exercise, aimed at training the very high-readiness component of the NATO Response Force, involved around 2,500 troops from France, Italy, Norway, Poland, and Spain, with 10 warships and 750 sailors supporting the operation at sea.

(Photo by Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP via Getty Images)Media coverage of hypothetical European &#x201C;boots on the ground&#x201D; is often presented in the context of a peacekeeping force entering Ukrainian territory after a hypothetical peace deal. While clear that larger players like France, Poland, or the U.K. would need to be involved, and that it is hard to imagine a new level of European action without the backing of the incoming U.S. administration, the role of smaller countries in the Nordic and Baltic states also looks to be critical. Consistently among the top providers of military aid to Kyiv as a percentage of GDP, countries like Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have also been the most outspoken in their support for Ukrainian victory, beyond the tired repetitions of &#x201C;as long as it takes.&#x201D; Recent alleged Russian sabotage attacks in the Baltic Sea, including the damaging of undersea cables running between Nordic and Baltic states, have served as a reminder that Russia&#x2019;s war is not limited to Ukrainian territory. The Kyiv Independent spoke to top officials, experts, and other stakeholders in some of Ukraine&#x2019;s top European partners to take the pulse of countries that could be part of a new &#x201C;coalition of the willing&#x201D; in their support of Ukraine in 2025. Before facing up to Trump, let alone Putin, the first major hurdle European countries must overcome is their own mindset, according to Jukka Kopra, chair of the Finnish parliament&#x2019;s defense committee. &#x201C;Finland has always taken defense seriously. So we have a conscription system. We have a large reserve-based army,&#x201D; Kopra said to the Kyiv Independent in Helsinki. &#x201C;Nobody&apos;s ever ready for war, but we have things in order. We take it seriously, unlike some other countries who only have things working on paper.&#x201D; Although relatively small in terms of hard geopolitical sway, since the launch of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, the countries immediately bordering Russia have often found themselves in the role of activist, pushing Ukraine&#x2019;s crystal-clear message that peace must come through strength in the NATO arena. &#x201C;One might think that when the escalated aggression started in February 2022, everybody&apos;s eyes would open,&#x201D; said Kopra. &#x201C;They are opening slowly, but not everywhere.&#x201D; Of all NATO member states, none show more clarity than the Baltic States, where the memory of Soviet occupation and the totalitarian repression that came with it remains fresh. Only recently stepping down after his country&#x2019;s last elections, former Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrelius Landsbergis has been one the most eloquent pro-Ukrainian voices among foreign officials. Lithuania&apos;s former Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis at Munich Security Conference 2024 in Munich, Germany on Feb. 18, 2024. (Olena Zashko / The Kyiv Independent)&#x201C;Appeasement is a recurring virus; the seasons vary in how often it does reoccur in Europe, but it always comes back,&#x201D; said Landsbergis to the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;The logic is always the same. I am the person who can appease, who can offer part of some other country to a dictator and all of us will be fine. It&apos;s so iconic when you see Chamberlain resurrected in 2024 in Europe and picking up the phone and saying, &#x2018;I have this.&#x2019;&#x201D; Landsbergis wasn&#x2019;t the only Baltic minister to mention the infamous British prime minister, who had signed the Munich Agreement with Nazi Germany less than a year before Adolf Hitler invaded Poland. &#x201C;If it is a Chamberlain peace, it will be the start of more and more aggression,&#x201D; said Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsakhna to the Kyiv Independent in Tallinn. &#x201C;Now, we have every opportunity to avoid everything that came after 1938: World War II. This is not only about Europe, it is about the world order.&#x201D; As clear as the rhetoric of the Nordics and Baltics has been, taking braver steps still requires the leadership of countries with more weight to throw around. &#x201C;These conversations have matured,&#x201D; said French security expert Leonie Allard to the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;But you need much more political weight from other Europeans, which we haven&apos;t seen so much.&#x201D; Germany, traditionally cautious but still the second-largest provider of military aid to Ukraine, looks to be completely absorbed by upcoming federal elections in February, while France&#x2019;s government collapsed in December. These countries that have traditionally been the leaders of Europe, they are kind of incapable at the moment,&#x201D; said Kopra, &#x201C;and what a coincidence it is, what a good position for the Kremlin.&#x201D; Still, the clear choice to take the lead is Paris, said Allard, who co-authored a recent paper published by the Atlantic Council entitled &#x201C;Europe needs a coalition of the resolute.&#x201D; Macron brings with him to the table personal experience dealing with both Putin and Trump, which could be crucial in coordinating a braver European bloc. &#x201C;France cannot do anything on its own, nothing at all,&#x201D; said Allard, &#x201C;it&apos;s also up to other Europeans to, you know, take this opportunity to put forward their own ideas on what they want to do.&#x201D; The other obvious candidate to strengthen such a coalition would be Poland, the nation with the most to lose in national security from an abandonment of neighboring Ukraine.

(Chesnot / Getty Images)Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has denied reports claiming he discussed deploying troops to Ukraine with Macron, as Warsaw sticks closely to a doctrine of beefing up its military to defend NATO borders. Still, the possibility of Poland changing its tune shouldn&#x2019;t be ruled out, said Allard. &#x201C;What other war is NATO preparing for apart from one with Russia?&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;There&apos;s only one thing, and if that thing means being in Ukraine, then it should be being in Ukraine. There is no other scenario.&#x201D; &#x201C;Whatever the solution is to the present situation in the war between Ukraine and Russia,&#x201D; said Kopra, &#x201C;in any case, we are back in the Cold War, and all of Europe should start accelerating accordingly.&#x201D; Since the launch of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Kyiv has stressed that Ukraine doesn&#x2019;t need foreign militaries to join the fight: the West only needs to provide the weaponry and ammunition, and Ukraine will do the job. When it comes to direct combat with Russian forces, this position hasn&#x2019;t changed, but with a dangerous and unpredictable outlook for the war in 2025, other versions of &#x201C;boots on the ground&#x201D; are being explored to improve Ukraine&#x2019;s position. A starting point often discussed is training. If conducted far from the front line, moving the existing overseas training programs into Ukrainian territory would not only make them more efficient, but send a strong signal to Moscow that the West will not just retreat to NATO&#x2019;s eastern flank. Speaking to the Kyiv Independent in Stockholm, Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson pointed out that representatives of his country&#x2019;s defense procurement agency were already on the ground in Ukraine, and that Sweden wouldn&#x2019;t rule out training Ukrainian troops on Ukrainian territory. Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson at the Munich Security Conference in Berlin, Germany on Feb. 16, 2024. (Olena Zashko / The Kyiv Independent)&#x201C;We think it&apos;s good if we can find unity on this, there are ongoing discussions in several different places in Europe,&#x201D; he said. According to Landsbergis, a move for European countries to begin training Ukrainian soldiers inside Ukraine could be the first step in a series of careful moves that will slowly but surely up the deterrence factor for Moscow. &#x201C;If they&apos;re trained in Ukraine, imagine that where troops are trained, the areas are defended with additional air defense support. You bring Lithuanian and French troops, the French bring in the air defense, and we start covering parts of Ukrainian territory.&#x201D; Nonetheless, for now, the majority of attention has been on the use of European troops as a physical security guarantee, as expressed by Zelensky after his calls with Macron. After a tough two years of attritional warfare which saw a failed Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023 and a steadily worsening manpower crisis, the fading perspective of a complete Ukrainian victory has turned attention to the need for peace to come with hard guarantees against a repeat Russian invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky speaks during a joint press conference with NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg at the 2024 NATO Summit in Washington, DC, on July 11, 2024. (Kevin Dietsch / Getty Images)Trump and his team, many of whom publicly subscribe to the myth that &#x201C;NATO expansion&#x201D; was one of the main causes of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, have spoken strongly against inviting Kyiv to the alliance, an offer that sat at the top of Zelensky&#x2019;s victory plan as presented to partners in October. &#x201C;What are these security guarantees in real life? Are they peacekeeping missions, military missions? Our point is very clear: NATO membership for Ukraine is the most secure, most clear, most efficient, and cheapest way to give real security guarantees. Any other structure is much more complicated.&#x201D; &#x201C;There are four countries that gave security guarantees for Ukraine (in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum). One of them attacked Ukraine &#x2015; Russia &#x2015; and the three others are not fulfilling that agreement.&#x201D; &#x201C;Currently, NATO is not ready to enter the war,&#x201D; said Braze, &#x201C;because the clear concept is that Ukraine&apos;s self-defense is supported, everybody provides what is necessary, but nobody wants to be part of the war, fighting the war.&#x201D; Though not as physically threatened by Russia as the Nordics or Baltics, France&#x2019;s leading role in a future troop deployment makes a lot of sense due to the organization of its military and recent experience, said Allard. &#x201C;France is the country that has an army structure that&apos;s based a lot on expeditionary forces, used to send forces abroad,&#x201D; she said, pointing to a wealth of recent French experience operating in the Sahel region in Africa.

(Alain Jocard / AFP via Getty Images)Once the time comes for deployment, it is very unlikely that European troops could be stationed along the contact line itself, as sometimes broached in visions of a so-called &#x201C;demilitarized zone.&#x201D; What is more realistic, said Allard, is the deployment of European forces in bases further back, with the explicit purpose of acting as a so-called &#x201C;tripwire force,&#x201D; with the explicit purpose of making any further Russian aggression in Ukraine immediately come at the cost of direct conflict with NATO. &#x201C;The size and the ability of this tripwire force to weigh on Ukraine security would be dependent on the level of lethality that we find ourselves in, in a situation of a deal.&#x201D; Ultimately, in the absence of NATO membership for Ukraine, &#x201C;boots on the ground&#x201D; might just be the kind of ad-hoc measure that is enough to deter an aging, weakened Putin from launching a repeat invasion. &#x201C;It changes Putin&apos;s calculations,&#x201D; said Landsbergis of the tripwire effect, &#x201C;because as President Macron clearly said, Putin will have to keep in mind that if you enter Odesa, you will find French troops.&#x201D; As much as real discussions might be ongoing among a potential future European &#x201C;coalition of the willing,&#x201D; even the most basic public specifics are still lacking. The reason for indecisiveness and delay is one person, Trump, but even more so, said Allard, is the looming anticipation of the results of his first steps for ending the war. &#x201C;We&apos;re waiting for the U.S. to put forward the terms of the potential negotiations,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;since it&apos;s their view &#x2014; that of the Trump team &#x2014; and try to help Ukraine to also be able to shape that. But if this goes forward, Europeans are ready to take on more responsibility.&#x201D; With Russia publicly rejecting early attempts at drawing up a tentative peace deal, Trump&#x2019;s incoming envoy for peace in Ukraine, retired General Keith Kellogg, has named 100 days as his personal target to reach a deal.

(Sean Gallup / Getty Images)&#x201C;The coin is still in the air, right? We don&apos;t know which side it will land on,&#x201D; said Landsbergis of Trump&#x2019;s approach to Putin upon inauguration. &#x201C;I think it&apos;s rather black and white, right? It&apos;s impossible that it lands on a situation which would be comfortable for both, for Ukrainians and Russians. That means that if you give something to Putin, that will be his victory and Ukrainian loss.&#x201D; In the meantime though, argues Allard, the last thing Europe should do is sit idle. If wants to weigh on Putin&apos;s decision to enter negotiations, Europe should try to move forward with a developed public position on troops in Ukraine now, she said. &#x201C;It&apos;s now that we, Europeans, should prepare and form this notion and not after a negotiation.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/will-europe-put-boots-on-the-ground-for-peace-in-ukraine-we-asked-top-nordic-baltic-officials/	2025-01-15T10:14:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2154604513.jpg
Ukrainian soldiers on capturing North Korean POW	After numerous attempts, Ukrainian forces operating in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast have finally captured two North Korean soldiers. President Volodymyr Zelensky called this &#x201C;irrefutable evidence&#x201D; of Pyongyang&#x2019;s involvement in the Kremlin&#x2019;s full-scale war against Ukraine. One of the two soldiers was taken prisoner by Ukraine&#x2019;s Special Operations Forces. Watch this video to find out why capturing North Korean soldiers is so challenging &#x2014; and how Ukrainian forces ultimately succeeded.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-soldiers-on-capturing-north-korean-pow/	2025-01-15T09:48:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/3_1.jpg
Ukraine’s military now totals 880,000 soldiers, facing 600,000 Russian troops, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 15 that Ukraine&apos;s military now comprises 880,000 soldiers, tasked with defending the entire country against 600,000 Russian troops concentrated in specific areas. Speaking at a joint press conference with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk in Warsaw, Zelensky said that Russia&apos;s localized troop concentration creates a numerical advantage. &quot;Russian troops are concentrated in several areas, so in some areas, they have a quantitative advantage,&quot; he said. Ukraine has been struggling with a manpower shortage, especially in the infantry, while Russia has intensified its offensive in Donetsk Oblast since the summer of 2024. Earlier on Jan. 14, a scandal erupted in Ukraine as Air Force members claimed they were being transferred to bolster the infantry. According to Ukrainska Pravda, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi issued an order on Jan. 11 to transfer over 5,000 Air Force personnel to Ground Forces units. A senior Air Force officer, speaking anonymously, said transfers began in spring 2024 and have now reached a &quot;critical level,&quot; with unit staffing dropping to 50%. The General Staff of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces denied claims of transferring technical and aviation personnel, saying that these resources are being increased. Critics have called for deeper mobilization reforms, as Ukraine&#x2019;s army faces challenges related to demographics and an uneven mobilization process. In 2024, Ukraine lowered its minimum mobilization age from 27 to 25 but resisted calls from international partners to reduce it further to 18. Zelensky also reported progress in arms production, saying that Ukraine now covers 33-34% of its annual weapons needs &#x2014; up from less than 10% before the full-scale invasion. Europe and the U.S. supply more than 60% of Ukraine&#x2019;s weaponry, with each accounting for about 30%.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-military-now-totals-880-000-soldiers-facing-600-000-russian-troops-zelensky-says/	2025-01-15T09:11:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187689001.jpg
Why Ukraine’s long-delayed missile production ambitions have yet to get off the ground	The Ukrainian government in recent months has been aggressively touting fresh developments in its missile-making. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the country had built 100 of its own missiles in 2024 as of November. He called for 3,000 &#x201C;cruise missiles or missile-drones&#x201D; to be manufactured in 2025. Traditional missiles are tricky. Ukraine&#x2019;s notable successes in scaling up drone production were to a large degree a workaround of the country&#x2019;s limits in defense industry autonomy. Russia and the West gutted Ukraine&#x2019;s weapons factories after the fall of the USSR, with the help of local corruption. Those that remain are subject to constant Russian bombardment. As a result, analysts call Zelensky&#x2019;s figures and the claimed features of traditional missiles made at home an oversell. &#x201C;If Ukraine can only deliver half of what Zelensky promised at the end of 2024 in terms of missile and drone production, I will be very content. But that&apos;s going to be challenging,&#x201D; says Fabian Hoffmann, a missile expert and research fellow at the Oslo Nuclear Project. Ukraine&#x2019;s budding missile program joins a long tradition of metaphorical and literal saber-rattling between hostile armies. For the time being, the missiles have yet to prove themselves on the battlefield. The challenge for outside observers is in sorting out ballistics from bluster. Here is what we know and can assess of the roster of Ukraine&#x2019;s home-grown missiles today. Originally designed to hit ships from coastal positions, the Neptune has been converted into a cruise missile that can be launched from land, per Ukrainian authorities. It is what Hoffmann calls &#x201C;by far the most mature of these large missile projects.&#x201D; Ukrainian officials said it was a Neptune that struck and sank the Russian cruiser Moskva back in April 2022. An unnamed official told the War Zone that they had reconfigured the Neptune to strike and disable an S-400 Russian air defense battery back in August 2023. Various Ukrainian Telegram channels cited anonymous sources saying that the Neptune was used to hit a Russian ammunition depot in Rostov Oblast on Jan. 11. But evidence of Neptunes flying is largely limited to government statements or citations of unnamed officials. That is despite Zelensky touting that the Neptune had been &#x201C;accepted into weaponry&#x201D; in a speech to Ukraine&#x2019;s Parliament all the way back in 2020. &#x201C;There were discussions that Ukraine would set up production for at least the anti-ship cruise missiles,&#x201D; says Hoffmann. &#x201C;Initially we heard that they were very artisanaly producing them &#x2014; just a couple per month at most, but there was not really a production line. But there was this assumption that Ukraine would be able to streamline that to some extent. And that obviously hasn&apos;t happened, at least if we derive it from the rate of usage which really hasn&apos;t seen any kind of uptick since 2023.&#x201D; Distinct from the cruise missile Neptune, the Hrim 2 &#x2014; or Thunder 2 in English &#x2014; is a ballistic rocket program, based on solid fuel and inertial guidance and in theory reaching speeds several times that of sound. Unlike a cruise missile, a ballistic missile goes far into the atmosphere, with many traveling at speeds many times that of sound. The program goes back as far as 2006 under the name Sapsan, which at some point became the internal name, as opposed to the envisioned international export model, the Hrim 2. Ukrainian officials said that the Hrim 2 finally passed testing toward the end of 2024, with Zelensky announcing &#x201C;positive results&#x201D; in August. The head of the permanent Ukrainian delegation to NATO, Yehor Cherniev, said of the Hrim 2s in October: &#x201C;Here, believe me, there will soon be concrete results that not only Ukraine, but the Russian Federation will see.&#x201D; &#x201C;I&#x2019;m seeing test launch claims from last year but, eh,&#x201D; says Michael Duitsman, a missile specialist at the Middlebury Institute in California, doubtfully, about the Hrim 2. Two projects, the Korshun and Vilcha &#x2014; respectively a cruise missile and multiple-launch rocket system &#x2014; were the subject of extensive press speculation in the mid- to late-2010s. The Korshun was a cruise missile, a scale model of which was getting dragged around weapons conferences a decade ago. Despite being a cruise missile, one pro-Russian Telegram channel in 2017 named it as the basis for the Hrim 2. The Korshun project has effectively been shelved since Zelensky&#x2019;s election. The Vilcha is an updated Soviet rocket complex that promised to use modernized, Ukrainian-made rockets with higher precision than its predecessor. Despite appearing in Ukrainian military parades as far back as 2018, there&#x2019;s been no evidence of a functional system playing a role since the full-scale invasion. Ukraine-made Trembita cruise missile. (mil.in.ua)In the same speech in which he promised &#x201C;concrete results&#x201D; for the Hrim 2, Cherniev noted certain components of the Vilcha that &#x201C;unfortunately, we won&#x2019;t be able to get quickly,&#x201D; without specifying what those components were. Various other projects like the volunteer-based &#x201C;Trembita&#x201D; are described as &#x201C;cruise missiles,&#x201D; including in reports from the Economist and the Telegraph, but have nowhere near the speed, range, or payload to merit that title as it is generally understood, maxing out at 400 kilometers/hour, 200 kilometers, and 20 kilograms in each field, respectively.. &#x201C;If you throw a rock fast enough you can call it a missile,&#x201D; says James Acuna, a former naval architect and CIA officer in Eastern Europe, currently consulting on drone production from Estonia, about the Trembita. The main distinction between making classic cruise or ballistic missiles and, for example, Ukraine&#x2019;s &#x201C;missile-drones,&#x201D; which the Trembita more closely resembles, is that the lighter and slower missile-drones can be made in smaller facilities with a far larger proportion of off-the-shelf commercial components. The production of those more advanced engines, guidance systems, and fuel for more traditional missiles requires bigger permanent facilities and massively more precise engineering. &#x201C;This is like another level of science and engineering and physics,&#x201D; says Acuna. &#x201C;Ukraine does not currently have the military-industrial complex to make missiles. Can they make a good Frankenstein missile? Sure, they can do that, but is it going to take down a Kh-31?&#x201D; Designed during the USSR, the Kh-31 is an air-launched missile that hits Mach 3.5 and still sees regular use in the Russian military. Duitsman for one doesn&#x2019;t think the problem is Ukrainian technological savvy so much as Russian air attacks. &#x201C;Once you get the basic industry down it&#x2019;s not that hard, it just becomes immensely harder when someone is trying to bomb all of your factories.&#x201D; Unlike the small workshops in which Ukrainians can produce drones, the factories involved in missile production are massive and their locations well-known. Many Russians still alive once worked in them during the Soviet Union. For the duration of the war, Russian airstrikes have targeted them avidly. In the first months of the war, Russia blew up a massive stockpile of solid rocket fuel in a chemical plant in Pavlohrad, on the western edge of the Donbas. Following a Dec. 20 attack on Kyiv, the Russian Defense Ministry said it had hit &#x201C;the construction bureau &#x2018;Luch,&#x2019; which has accomplished planning and production of rocket complex &#x2018;Neptune&#x2019; and the land-based guided rocket complex &#x2018;Vilcha.&#x2019;&#x201D; Aircraft engines are displayed at the Motor Sich Aviation Museum in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, on July 1, 2022. (Julia Kochetova / Bloomberg via Getty Images)And on Jan. 8, Russia bombarded the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia with glide bombs, resulting in the death of some 13 people and 113 more injured. Among the targeted areas, photos from the national police show damage to a &#x201C;Motor Sich&#x201D; factory that has long produced jet engines, including the MS400 Turbofan engines that at least at some point powered the Neptune. Given such security threats it is not surprising that Ukraine has been secretive in details about its missile program. When reached, a representative for the Strategic Industries Ministry declined to comment, calling it &#x201C;a sensitive subject.&#x201D; Still, little has been seen of these missiles in action, casting great doubt on Ukraine&#x2019;s actual production. Mass use within Russia would almost certainly have ended up on social media via Russians under bombardment. Despite the secrecy, Ukraine is obviously eager to tout successes in these missile programs. The development of a local missile program would allow Ukraine to strike back at Russia directly, freed from Western terms for donated weaponry. Missiles have also become more intangible symbols of independence. Eastern Ukraine was the heartland for much of the Soviet Union&#x2019;s heavy industry. Yuzhnomash in Dnipro was the &#x201C;largest ICBM factory in the world,&#x201D; notes Duitsman. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Ukraine&#x2019;s missile production was dismantled and cannibalized. The government has spent 20 years claiming that a rocket renaissance is at hand. Renamed to Pivdenmash &#x2014; a shift from the Russian to Ukrainian word &#x201C;pivden&#x201D; meaning &#x201C;south&#x201D; &#x2014; the same factory remains an epicenter of Ukraine&#x2019;s weapons production, including the Hrim itself. As with many such plants, Pivdenmash is a target for Russian missile attacks, including the infamous strike by Russia&#x2019;s new Oreshnik on Nov. 21, an event that had many Western observers wringing their hands over the world&#x2019;s first launch of an ICBM. Ukraine is hardly alone in treating missiles as fonts of national pride. U.S. military sources were positively gleeful in touting the Patriot air defense missile&#x2019;s success in shooting down Russia&#x2019;s hypersonic Kinzhal in May 2023. Russia has often bragged about weapons developments beyond their utility. The Russian Oreshnik that struck Pivdenmash in November, for example, was far less impressive than the headlines it managed to gather, says Duitsman. The Oreshnik, he argues, was a fairly minor adaptation of a prior missile that was touted as novel based on the maker&#x2019;s advertising and President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s sudden desire to cause a stir after the U.S. and U.K. permitted Ukraine to strike some Russian territory. &#x201C;States are not monoliths. Russia does not as a whole choose to pursue different missile programs,&#x201D; says Duitsman. &#x201C;These are the results of conflicting political, military, industrial, and engineering goals. The Oreshnik does not necessarily make sense in a military context. It does make sense in the context of these missile design bureaus and missile production factories wanting a piece of the sweet sweet war money pie.&#x201D; Ukraine seems likewise to be overselling the tangible results of local missile development, Hoffmann says. &#x201C;They have a vested interest in making it look like they&apos;re doing well,&#x201D; as Duitsman puts it.	https://kyivindependent.com/why-ukraines-long-delayed-missile-production-ambitions-have-yet-to-get-off-the-ground/	2025-01-15T08:43:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/2022-04-2560px-neptune-cruise-missile-05-1024x689.jpg
NATO defense budget could surpass Russia’s tenfold if Europe matches Poland’s spending, Tusk says	Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk advocated for increased defense spending across NATO on Jan. 15, arguing that if all European members matched Poland&#x2019;s spending, NATO&#x2019;s defense budget would be ten times that of Russia&#x2019;s. &quot;No one but Europe will solve its defense problems,&quot; he said during a joint press conference with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Warsaw. Tusk&#x2019;s comment comes amid growing calls for higher defense spending across NATO, a topic reignited by Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and advocated for by incoming U.S. President Donald Trump. &quot;Other countries should not pay 1.5 percent of their GDP for defense &#x2014; this is not enough,&quot; he said, emphasizing that robust European defense contributions could help maintain friendly U.S.-European relations. On Jan. 7, Trump called for NATO&#x2019;s spending target to rise to 5% of GDP, significantly higher than the current 2% goal. &quot;If all European countries start taking their obligations in NATO seriously, I am sure America will be happy to cooperate with us,&quot; Tusk added. While the 5% suggestion has faced resistance, some NATO members are reportedly open to a more modest increase, potentially to 3% of GDP, Reuters reported on Jan. 10. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte quipped on Jan. 13 that allies should increase spending or prepare to &quot;take Russian language courses or move to New Zealand.&quot; Currently, 24 out of 32 NATO countries meet the 2% GDP target, but several, including Italy, Canada, and Spain, fall short. Zelensky praised his discussions with Tusk, highlighting their focus on bolstering Ukraine&#x2019;s defense capabilities and advancing sanctions against Russia. &quot;We discussed our defense, including the supply of weapons, weapons production, and related investments. We also focused on strengthening sanctions against Russia and bringing peace closer for Ukraine and all of Europe,&quot; Zelensky said on X.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-defense-budget-could-surpass-russias-tenfold-if-europe-matches-polands-spending-pm-says/	2025-01-15T08:42:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GhVq_yOXcAAXWBM.jpeg
‘Absolutely unacceptable’ — Appointment of Ukrainian judge who visited occupied Crimea, Russia triggers criticism	The appointment of a Ukrainian judge who visited Russia and occupied Crimea during Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine has sparked criticism from the head of the country&#x2019;s main judicial watchdog. The High Council of Justice, Ukraine&apos;s top judicial governing body, appointed Oleksandra Shulika as a judge of Kirovohrad Oblast&apos;s Onufriivka District Court on Jan. 14. The decision highlights the continued presence of officials with ties to Russia in the Ukrainian government. While some officials with Russian passports and other links to Russia have been fired, others remain in their positions. Ukraine has a constitutional ban on judges and other officials with foreign passports. Shulika went to Crimea in 2014 after its illegal annexation by Russia and visited Russia several times from 2015 to 2019. &quot;This is absolutely unacceptable,&quot; Mykhailo Zhernakov, executive director of the judicial watchdog the Dejure Foundation, wrote in a post on Facebook. &#x201C;Not only do they help representatives of the judicial mafia remain in their positions but also allow sympathizers of Russia to take vacant positions in the judicial system,&#x201D; he said. Ukraine&apos;s judiciary is still notoriously corrupt despite repeated attempts to reform it, according to watchdogs. Some Ukrainian judges have routinely obstructed justice and blocked reforms. &#x201C;How do you like this &apos;reformed&apos; body? And what do you think &#x2014; will they let us into the EU with this kind of system?&quot; The High Council of Justice did not respond to a request for comment. Zhernakov said the appointment of judges who visited Russia and the occupied territories during the war violates the High Council of Justice&apos;s own guidelines. This is not the first scandal around a judge with ties to Russia. Bohdan Lvov, a former deputy chairman of the Supreme Court, received Russian citizenship in 1999 and still had a valid Russian passport, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&apos;s Schemes investigation project reported in 2022. Schemes cited official information from Russia&#x2019;s Federal Tax Service and leaked documents from Russia&#x2019;s official passport database. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) later confirmed that Lvov had Russian citizenship. Vsevolod Knyazev, then head of the Supreme Court, fired Lvov in October 2022 due to a constitutional ban on judges having foreign citizenship. The Kyiv District Administrative Court issued a ruling in January 2024 to reinstate Lvov as a Supreme Court judge. The court claimed that there was not enough proof of Lvov&#x2019;s Russian citizenship. In June 2024, an appellate court reversed the ruling and rejected Lvov&apos;s lawsuit for reinstatement.	https://kyivindependent.com/appointment-of-judge-who-visited-occupied-crimea-russia-triggers-criticism/	2025-01-15T07:35:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-479350285.jpg
Polish PM accuses Russia of planning 'air terror,' condemns sabotage efforts	Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Jan. 15 accused Russia of planning terrorist attacks against international airlines, including in Poland. &quot;Russia has been planning air terror &#x2014; not only against Poland but also against airlines around the world,&quot; he said during a joint press conference with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Warsaw. Tusk&apos;s remarks come after a Jan. 14 New York Times report claiming the outgoing U.S. administration warned Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt intelligence operations involving planting incendiary devices on U.S.-bound cargo planes. &quot;These acts of sabotage are versions of the war that Russia has declared to the whole world, not just Ukraine. They require joint action, and Poland plays a key role in countering such threats,&quot; Tusk said. U.S. intelligence reportedly intercepted communications in August 2024 among Russian secret service officers discussing plots to smuggle incendiary devices onto cargo planes. Moscow has been suspected of being behind incidents in July 2024, where several parcels sent by individuals caught fire in warehouses in Germany and the U.K. Had these fires occurred mid-flight, they could have resulted in catastrophic crashes. U.S. media reported these operations were intended as preparations for similar plots targeting the U.S. and Canada, which reportedly raised alarm among White House officials. Zelensky traveled to Poland to meet Tusk after reaching a &quot;breakthrough&quot; agreement over World War II exhumations, a long-standing source of tension between the nations. The leaders emphasized shared efforts to counter Russian aggression and address regional security challenges. Zelensky and Tusk last met in December 2024 in Lviv to discuss historical reconciliation, including issues surrounding the Volyn massacre.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-pm-accuses-russia-of-planning-global-airline-terror-attacks-condemns-sabotage-efforts/	2025-01-15T06:23:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193453413.jpg
Ukraine brings back 25 people from Russian captivity, including Azovstal defenders	Ukraine managed to bring back 25 Ukrainians from Russian captivity including Azovstal defenders, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Jan. 15. &quot;Returning our people home is something that Ukraine is constantly working on. And we will not stop until we bring all of our people back,&quot; Zelensky said in a post on Telegram. The returning Ukrainian POWs were captured during the defense of Mariupol and its Azovstal steel plant, as well as during the defense of other key areas of the front line in Kharkiv, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts, Zelensky added. He said some of those brought back have serious injuries and illnesses. Bringing our people home is what Ukraine is constantly working on, and we will not stop until we bring all of our people back. Today, 25 more of our people are returning home to Ukraine. These are our military and civilians. Among them are the defenders of Mariupol and&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/wDMeTUxYK0 The exchange was conducted on a 25 for 25 basis. In a recent agreement, Russia and Ukraine agreed to prioritize wounded POWs at selection of exchanges, followed by those held longest in captivity. President Zelensky also expressed his gratitude for the United Arab Emirates for mediating between the parties. Over the past year, Ukraine conducted 11 prisoner exchanges and secured the return of 356 more people than in 2023. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Nearly 4,000 people have been released, including 1,358 in 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-brings-back-25-people-from-russian-captivity-including-azovstal-defenders/	2025-01-15T05:27:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-15-at-15_18_38.png
Strongest action possible' — Albanese vows to act if Australian fighting for Ukraine was executed by Russia	Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese pledged the &quot;strongest action possible&quot; during a Jan. 15 press conference if reports of an Australian national captured while fighting for Ukraine being executed by Russian forces are confirmed, CNN reported. Oscar Jenkins, a 32-year-old teacher from Melbourne, was reported captured by Russian forces in December. Ukrainian sources told 7News that Jenkins&apos; body had been found, suggesting he was executed by his captors. Australia&apos;s Foreign Ministry has summoned the Russian ambassador to demand information and stress compliance with international law. Albanese said his government seeks &quot;urgent clarification&quot; and described the reports as &quot;gravely concerning.&quot; &quot;If there has been any harm caused to Oscar Jenkins, that is absolutely reprehensible,&quot; Albanese said, as reported by CNN. He did not specify potential actions Canberra might take. In late December, Russian Telegram channels circulated a video showing Jenkins in military fatigues, interrogated and beaten by his captors. Jenkins is seen providing his name and background as the interrogators question his desire to live. Jenkins introduces himself in the video as a biology teacher who came to help Ukraine and is now based near Kramatorsk, a city in Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk Oblast, located approximately 700 kilometers (430 miles) east of Kyiv, and 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of the front line. The Geneva Conventions require humane treatment of prisoners of war (POWs) and prohibit executions, which are classified as war crimes. Russia has repeatedly been accused of violating these laws by summarily executing Ukrainian POWs. Moscow, however, labels foreign volunteers as &quot;mercenaries&quot; and denies them the protections afforded to POWs under international law. If confirmed, Jenkins&apos; execution would mark the first instance of an Australian volunteer fighter captured and executed by Russian forces since the full-scale invasion began. At least six Australians are believed to have been killed fighting for Ukraine. The Australian government and Ukrainian authorities continue to investigate Jenkins&apos; fate.	https://kyivindependent.com/strongest-action-possible-pm-albanese-pledges-action-if-australian-fighting-for-ukraine-was-executed-by-russia/	2025-01-15T04:59:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1257670533.jpeg
Putin's war economy is running on fumes as inflation and shortages surge	Russian President Vladimir Putin frequently boasts about the strength of his country&#x2019;s economy, claiming that Western sanctions only made it stronger (while in the same breath demanding that they be lifted). In fact, &#x201C;stagflation&#x201D; &#x2014; inflation combined with minimal growth &#x2014; is coming to Russia. His war on Ukraine has caused both high and rising prices and labor shortages, because many workers have been mobilized or killed, while many others have fled the country. Heading into the Russian Central Bank&#x2019;s regularly scheduled board meeting in late December, most observers expected monetary authorities to raise the policy rate from 21% to 23%. Yet the Russian Central Bank kept the rate unchanged, despite an increase in the official annual inflation figure, from 8.4% to 9.5% in the space of two months. It is easy to guess what happened. Just a day before, Putin said he had spoken with Russian Central Bank Chair Elvira Nabiullina, and it is safe to assume that he told her to leave the policy rate where it is. Any illusion about the Russian Central Bank&apos;s independence vanished. For the first time, Putin appears to have listened to Russia&#x2019;s oligarchs rather than the professional economists overseeing monetary policy. In the last couple of months, numerous top loyalists and businessmen &#x2014; from Sergei Chemezov of Rostec (defense production) and Igor Sechin of Rosneft (oil) to Alexander Shokin of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs &#x2014; have bitterly complained that high interest rates will drive many companies into bankruptcy. These warnings are not unfounded. Since the Russian government ended mortgage subsidies last July, sales of newly built properties have plummeted by around 50%, pushing Russia&#x2019;s two biggest real-estate developers, Samolet and PIK, to the brink of insolvency. Meanwhile, Russia&#x2019;s official inflation figure becomes less credible by the day. According to the independent research firm ROMIR, the average cost of a Russian basket of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), such as food and household chemicals, had risen by 22.1% year on year in September. The company has published no new inflation readings since. It is easy to guess why. Oil storage tanks are illuminated at night at the RN-Tuapsinsky refinery, operated by Rosneft Oil Co., in Tuapse, Russia, on March 22, 2020. (Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images)To be sure, the FMCG price index does not reflect overall consumer inflation, since it does not track the prices of durable goods and services, which have risen less sharply compared to food prices. Yet there can be little doubt that the official Russian price index figure is too low. We might not know whether inflation is 12% or 22%, but we can be quite confident that it is higher than 9.5%. Even at Putin&#x2019;s own highly choreographed annual press conference last month, inflation was the dominant concern. Russia&#x2019;s inflation is not overtly caused by fiscal profligacy. On the contrary, the Kremlin has long maintained budget surpluses (though it did register a small budget deficit of around 2% of GDP in 2022 and 2023, and it is likely to do so again in 2024). The Russia expert and former banker Craig Kennedy, however, has recently uncovered evidence that since mid-2022, the Kremlin has been strong-arming Russian banks to lend to war-related businesses on preferential terms. This off-budget financing scheme has contributed to a $415 billion surge in corporate borrowing, boosting inflation and rendering Russia&#x2019;s finances highly vulnerable. For a normal country, a budget deficit of 2% of GDP would be of no concern. But Russia is not a normal country. It has been the subject of Western financial sanctions since July 2014, and these have been quite effective at blocking access to international financing. Russia&#x2019;s total private and public foreign debt has fallen from $729 billion at the end of 2013 to $293 billion at the end of September 2024. Yet nobody &#x2014; including Chinese state banks &#x2014; dares to lend it money. Starved of financing, Russia has raised taxes substantially this year. Abandoning the 13% flat income tax established in 2000, it has introduced a progressive income tax system with rates starting at 15% and rising to 22% for top earners. Meanwhile, the tax rate on corporate profits has increased from 20% to 25%. But since these changes will generate only around 1.4% of GDP more in state revenues, the rest of the deficit must be financed with domestic bonds whose interest rates have already skyrocketed, doubling the cost of debt service as a share of total expenditure since 2019. Russia thus remains dependent on a single source of financing: the National Wealth Fund, whose liquid reserves have fallen from $117 billion in 2021 to $31 billion at the end of November. That is only enough to finance three-quarters of the budget deficit in 2025. Western financial sanctions have also weighed on the ruble, which has sunk from 34 to the dollar in 2013 to 103 today. This, too, aggravates inflation, because the central bank no longer has the reserves to defend the exchange rate (by spending dollars to buy rubles). Though Russia has stopped publishing most of its foreign-trade statistics, the Bank of Finland Institute for Emerging Economics (whose scientific council I chair) estimates that its total exports plummeted by 28% (to $425 billion) from 2022 to 2023. Most likely, they remained at the same level in 2024, because Western energy sanctions had not been significantly tightened, although the outgoing Biden administration did so on January 10. At the same time, tighter Western technology sanctions have had devastating effects on Russian manufacturing. Of the 108 airliners Russia planned to build since 2022, only seven have been completed. Dire conditions in the civilian sector presumably extend to the armaments sector, which is largely monopolized by Chemezov&#x2019;s corrupt Rostec. Strained by these factors, the Russian economy is approaching its moment of truth. Inflation will continue to rise in 2025, and people will get even angrier over higher food prices. Major bankruptcies are looming, and the Russian state cannot afford large bailouts. Business leaders are fiercely objecting to high interest rates, and the shortage of labor &#x2014; and soldiers &#x2014; is reaching a crisis stage. The most critical shortage, however, is budget financing, as Russia&#x2019;s last liquid reserves are likely to run out in the fall of 2025. Budget cuts will then become necessary. In the meantime, the war economy might also require price controls and rationing &#x2014; the old Soviet sins. As the risk of a financial crash rises, Russia&#x2019;s imperiled economy is about to pose serious constraints on Putin&#x2019;s war. Editor&#x2019;s Note: Copyright, Project Syndicate.

Lithuania would consider troop deployment to Ukraine upon Kyiv’s request, FM Budrys says	Vilnius would consider deploying troops to Ukraine with its allies in the future if Kyiv were to make such a request, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys told LRT TV on Jan. 14. The proposal for an international peacekeeping force has gained traction recently, as European nations prepare to take a more prominent role in Ukraine&apos;s defense when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Budrys said that Lithuania did not rule out such possibilities which were touted at a summit in Paris last year when French President Emmanuel Macron invited Lithuania&#x2019;s president and others to explore expanded military involvement in Ukraine. &quot;Lithuania is a security provider in the region, not just a recipient,&quot; Budrys said. &quot;If the question arises, I have no doubt that the Lithuanian flag will be there.&quot; &quot;We&#x2019;d talk with our allies and partners about what it looks like, and we&#x2019;d talk with Ukraine about what it looks like,&quot; he added. Macron has championed the idea of deploying European troops in Ukraine since early 2024. President Volodymyr Zelensky and Macron discussed the possibility during a meeting on Dec. 18, and Macron raised the proposal again during a trilateral meeting with Trump on Dec. 7. Trump reportedly expressed interest in European-led ceasefire monitoring. On Jan. 13, Zelensky and Macron held a phone call to discuss Ukraine&#x2019;s air defense priorities and the possible deployment of peacekeepers. Both leaders agreed to meet soon to advance plans for securing guarantees for Ukraine. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is also expected to visit Ukraine in the coming weeks to discuss the peacekeeping initiative, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 10.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-would-consider-troop-deployment-to-ukraine-upon-kyivs-request-fm-budrys-says/	2025-01-15T04:37:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1527606933.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine wound at least 16, kill 1 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine wounded 16 and killed one person over the past day, regional authorities, and the Office of the Prosecutor General reported on Jan. 15. Eight people, including two children were injured in Donetsk Oblast, the Office of the Prosecutor General reported on its Telegram channel, when the Russian military struck a multi-storey building in Kramatorsk. On the night of January 14-15 the Russian military attacked Ukraine with one Iskander-M/KN ballistic missile, seven Kh-22/32, 27 Kh-101/Kh-55 and four Kalibr cruise missiles, as well as four Kh-59/Kh-69 guided missiles. During the overnight attack, Russia also launched 74 Shahed-type and various other types of dummy drones, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported on their Telegram channel. Air defenses shot down 23 Kh-101/Kh-55 and three Kalibr cruise missiles, along with Kh-59/Kh-69 guided missiles. They also downed 47 drones, while 27 other drones were lost in the airspace, the Air Force said. The missiles hit critical infrastructure in Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblasts, with no reports of casualties. A 52-year-old man died, and a 74-year-old woman was injured during Russian attacks on Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported on his Telegram channel. Seven were injured as a result of Russian attacks on the city of Kherson and 36 other settlements, Kherson Oblast Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on his Telegram channel.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-wound-at-least-16-kill-1-over-past-day/	2025-01-15T04:27:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GhVGQqmXkAAx1mF.jpeg
Transnistria to receive Russian gas as humanitarian aid, head of breakaway region says	Russia will resume gas supplies to Transnistria in the form of humanitarian aid, the head of the Moscow-controlled breakaway region said on Jan. 15, but those to the rest of Moldova will remain cut off. Vadim Krasnoselsky made the announcement in a statement after returning from a trip to Moscow, where he attended talks at Russia&#x2019;s Ministry of Energy. Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom halted gas supplies to Moldova on Jan. 1, citing alleged unpaid debts by Moldovagaz. The gas suspension has led to widespread power outages in Transnistria, pushing the region toward industrial collapse. &quot;Gas supplies for the needs of Transnistrians and the functioning of the economy of Transnistria will be restored in the format of providing humanitarian and technical assistance to the republic,&quot; Krasnoselsky said. He did not provide technical details nor a timeline for the restoration of gas flows. Transnistrian authorities previously rejected an offer from Chisinau to help purchase gas via European platforms. While Moldova has transitioned to European energy supplies, Transnistria remains heavily reliant on Russian gas. Russian troops have been stationed in the region since the early 1990s. Gazprom&#x2019;s suspension coincided with the expiration of a deal allowing Russian gas to transit through Ukraine. However, Gazprom attributed the cutoff to Moldova&apos;s purported debt rather than transit issues. Moldovan officials dispute these claims, pointing to an international audit that failed to verify the alleged debt.	https://kyivindependent.com/transnistria-to-receive-russian-gas-humanitarian-aid/	2025-01-15T03:37:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2043777119.jpg

Biden team seeks European support to leverage frozen Russian assets in talks with Moscow, CNN reports	As the Biden administration prepares to leave office, it is reportedly urging European partners to support the transfer of frozen Russian central bank assets worth $300 billion to a special account as leverage in negotiations with Moscow, CNN reported on Jan. 15, citing anonymous administration officials. The strategy reportedly aims to pressure Moscow by signaling the funds could only be reclaimed through negotiations with Ukraine. &quot;If you want to get this money, you will have to negotiate,&quot; a source told CNN. The proposal involves moving the frozen assets, currently held primarily in European banks, to a deposit account from which withdrawals would only be allowed as part of a future peace deal with Ukraine. Biden officials are reportedly discussing the plan with President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s team, including Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio, and incoming National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. Both reportedly back the initiative, aligning with Trump&apos;s goal to expedite a resolution to the war. European governments have reportedly expressed hesitancy about the plan, citing concerns over its compliance with international law. Confiscation of frozen Russian funds has been a contentious issue, and even using the assets&apos; annual income &#x2014; around $3.2 billion &#x2014; required significant negotiation. The European Union recently disbursed &#x20AC;3 billion ($3.09 billion) to Ukraine as part of a $50 billion G7 loan initiative. The EU&apos;s &#x20AC;20 billion ($20.6 billion) contribution to the program is partially funded by income from frozen Russian assets. The U.S. has also contributed $20 billion toward the loan assistance, showcasing a concerted Western effort to support Ukraine financially while leveraging Russian assets. Outgoing President Joe Biden expressed confidence on Jan. 10 in his administration&apos;s support for Ukraine, saying he did &quot;all I could to help&quot; while voicing hope for continued U.S. backing under Trump. As the U.S. transitions to a new administration, the international community&apos;s stance on utilizing these assets may significantly influence diplomatic efforts to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-team-seeks-european-support-to-leverage-frozen-russian-assets-in-talks-with-moscow-cnn-reports/	2025-01-15T03:12:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184603402.jpg
Ukrainians divided over what peace with Russia should look like, new poll reveals	There is no clear consensus among Ukrainians about what a potential peace agreement with Russia should look like, a new global poll published on Jan. 15 has found. The poll, conducted by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), presented respondents with four options relating to NATO/EU membership, security guarantees, and ceding/regaining occupied territories. Not one gained a majority for or against from respondents. (European Council on Foreign Relations)&quot;Such disagreements could stoke political turmoil if and when negotiations begin,&quot; the report reads. Though peace negotiations are a long way off, the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 20 has accelerated discussion of their possibility in Kyiv, Moscow, and capitals around the world. Trump vowed to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table and swiftly end the full-scale war that nears its third anniversary. Earlier this week, he told reporters that arrangements for a meeting with Putin are underway. The wide-ranging, global poll surveyed respondents in 16 European countries including the U.K., Russia, and Ukraine, and eight non-European countries including Brazil, China, India, Saudi Arabia, and the U.S. about attitudes towards the U.S. and international powers ahead of Trump&apos;s inauguration. Many of the questions related to Trump&apos;s possible influence on global events such as the wars in Ukraine, and the Middle East, as well as the future balance of global power. In Ukraine, expectations of an outright victory in the war against Russia have fallen sharply in just the last six months since the poll was last conducted, from 58% in May 2024, to 34% in November 2024. Of the options available, most Ukrainians &#x2014; 47% &#x2014; now say a compromise settlement with Russia is the most likely outcome of the war. (European Council on Foreign Relations)Ukrainians are split on whether or not the incoming Trump administration will make peace more or less likely &#x2014; 39% say it will be more likely, 35% less likely, and 26% say it will make no difference. (European Council on Foreign Relations)The question is still largely hypothetical &#x2014; despite multiple promises during the U.S. presidential election campaign to negotiate an end to the war as soon as he was elected, Donald Trump is yet to lay out any concrete plans of how he intends to do so. Tempering expectations further, Trump&apos;s choice for special Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, earlier this month said Trump wants to end the war in 100 days. Then there is the issue of what Trump will demand from both sides. While much of the election rhetoric from Trump and his allies suggested Kyiv could be forced to pay a heavy price and cede territory, Kellogg has also sought to play this down. &quot;People need to understand, he&apos;s not trying to give something to Putin or to the Russians, he&apos;s actually trying to save Ukraine and save their sovereignty,&quot; Kellogg said. &quot;And he&apos;s going to make sure that it&apos;s equitable and it&apos;s fair.&quot; As for the global implications of a second Trump presidency, and how he deals with issues such as the war in Ukraine, the poll found a wide range of views across the countries polled. In India, China, and Brazil, majorities or pluralities believe Trump will be a &quot;good thing&quot; for prospects of peace around the world, as well as for their own countries. But in countries more allied with the U.S. there was skepticism &#x2014; only 24% of those in the UK, 31% in South Korea, and 34% in the EU countries polled said Trump&apos;s presidency would make peace in Ukraine more likely, while even fewer thought the same about the Middle East. The authors of the report suggested that while there is obviously a nervousness in Europe about Trump, there is also an opportunity for Europe to reassert itself on the global stage. &quot;Europe may stand almost alone in a Trumpian world, but this doesn&#x2019;t mean we Europeans are powerless to act,&quot; historian Timothy Garton Ash said, adding: &quot;There are opportunities in this new, transactional space for alliances and influence. &quot;Indeed, the very fact that the EU is held in such high regard by people in so many countries and is even expected to grow in strength in the coming decade, should give leaders hope that there is room for a strong and independent-minded Europe in the world.&quot; The poll was conducted in November 2024 in 16 European countries (Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, T&#xFC;rkiye, Ukraine and the United Kingdom), and eight non-European countries (Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea and the United States). The total number of respondents was 28,549.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-divided-over-what-peace-with-russia-should-look-like-new-poll-reveals/	2025-01-15T02:45:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2191058089.jpg
‘We know how the good guy is’ — Trump’s defense nominee grilled over war in Ukraine	President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s nominee for defense secretary was grilled over the war in Ukraine during a confirmation hearing on Jan. 14, after he failed to mention Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion during his opening remarks. Speaking to the Armed Services Committee, Pete Hegseth was asked if the omission was &quot;code for &apos;we&#x2019;re going to abandon Ukraine.&apos;&quot; &quot;We know who the aggressor is,&quot; Hegesth replied, adding: &quot;We know who the good guy is. We&#x2019;d like to see (the resolution of the war be) as advantageous for the Ukrainians as possible.&quot; &quot;But that war needs to come to an end,&quot; he added. The Armed Services Committee is expected to vote on Hegseth&#x2019;s confirmation as soon as Monday, Reuters reports. He will then be considered by the full U.S. Senate. Hegseth&#x2019;s nomination in November sent shockwaves through Pentagon corridors, with officials anonymously questioning his qualifications to lead the department. He would lead 1.3 million troops and over 750,000 civilians, preside over a $850 billion budget, and hold meetings with U.S. allies, acting as the principal defense policymaker and adviser. A former conservative talk show host on Fox News, Hegesth is seen as an isolationist who has called for reducing the U.S. commitment to the NATO military alliance. He previously served as an infantry captain in the Army National Guard, doing multiple tours of Afghanistan and Iraq. Following his discharge from the army, he became head of the conservative organization Concerned Veterans for America and, in June 2024, released a book titled &quot;The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.&quot; Hegseth also unsuccessfully ran as a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Minnesota in 2012.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-know-how-the-good-guy-is-trumps-defense-nominee-grilled-over-war-in-ukraine/	2025-01-15T01:32:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/GettyImages-2193430534.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 9	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 9 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Jan. 6&#x2013;12, 2025. This newsletter was until recently titled &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief.&quot; The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Parliament pushes forward draft law at odds with IMF requirements Last week, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, rejected draft law #12368, submitted by the Cabinet of Ministers, which aimed to establish a High Administrative Court. Instead, lawmakers backed an alternative proposal, draft law #12368-1, introduced by MP Vlasenko of the Batkivshchyna faction, in its first reading. This version designates the Kyiv City District Administrative Court to handle cases concerning the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine and Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&apos;s Office competitions and audits. For appeals it proposes to establish a separate Kyiv City Appeal Administrative Court. This move diverges from Ukraine&#x2019;s commitments under the International Monetary Fund&apos;s Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). Parliament set to vote public investment management bill During sessions scheduled for Jan. 14-17, 2025, the Verkhovna Rada will review draft law #12245 on public investment management in its second and final reading. The Budget Committee approved it on Monday morning. This legislation is crucial for meeting a structural benchmark under the MEFP, with a deadline at the end of January 2025. Transparency International Ukraine has flagged concerns over recent amendments that grant the Cabinet of Ministers authority to increase salaries for State Audit Service employees and assign special ranks and statuses to the SAS. Parliament to vote on draft law to repeal &quot;Lozovyy Amendments,&quot; rejection likely The Verkhovna Rada is set to consider a revised draft law #12367 amending the Criminal Procedure Code in its first reading. This government-backed legislation aims to fulfill obligations related to repealing the &quot;Lozovyy amendments&quot; and addressing the implications of expired pre-trial investigation time limits. Our information indicates a significant risk of rejection when it comes to a vote. The Law Enforcement Committee hasn&#x2019;t decided on the draft law during its meeting on Jan. 13. It is more likely that MPs will submit an alternative bill. Ukraine advances energy sector commitments The Verkhovna Rada has adopted draft law #12131, reinstating monitoring and reporting on greenhouse gas emissions, fulfilling a key requirement under the Ukraine Plan. The deadline for this measure was set for the end of the second quarter of 2025. Corporate governance reform sees progress Parliament has passed draft law #6013, mandating corporate governance standards across utility and state-owned enterprises. In particular, these companies will have to sell assets via &#x201C;Prozorro.Sales&#x201D; and publish financial reports. Moreover, the Cabinet of Ministers approved new procedures for evaluating the performance of supervisory boards in SOEs. Oleksii Sobolev, first deputy economy minister, noted that this includes mandatory performance assessments for the boards of Ukrenergo, Naftogaz, and the Gas Transmission System Operator (GTSO) for the previous year. The reform aims to ensure supervisory board independence and adherence to OECD corporate governance principles, requiring annual submission of development and performance reports by the end of March.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-9/	2025-01-15T01:19:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1245855806.jpg
Zelensky to visit Poland after ‘breakthrough’ agreement on Volyn tragedy exhumations	President Volodymyr Zelensky will travel to Poland on Jan 15 to meet with Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Reuters reported, after a &#x201C;breakthrough&#x201D; agreement was reached between the two countries in a long-running dispute over World War II exhumations. The Volyn massacre involved widespread violence that claimed tens of thousands of Polish and Ukrainian lives. Poland characterizes the events as genocide perpetrated by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), while Ukraine has called for shared acknowledgment of responsibility for the atrocities. Tusk announced on Jan. 10 that a decision has been made to exhume the first victims of the Volyn tragedy. &quot;There are a lot of topics (to discuss), including of course exhumations,&quot; a Polish government official was quoted as saying by Reuters. &quot;What interests us is the way these decisions (about exhumations) are carried out.&quot; They added the two leaders would hold a joint press conference in Poland. According to Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita, exhumations will begin as early as April 2025. Zelensky and Tusk previously met in Lviv in December 2024, to address historical reconciliation, including the legacy of the Volyn massacre. Tusk emphasized the importance of unity despite historical challenges. &#x201C;History certainly cannot divide us,&#x201D; he said in December 2024. The exhumations represent a significant step forward in resolving longstanding historical tensions and strengthening Polish-Ukrainian relations amid challenges posed by Russia&apos;s aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-visit-poland-after-breakthrough-agreement-on-volyn-tragedy-exhumations/	2025-01-14T23:24:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/ad251d9b370ace3d876b64ad229cbd6c_1734456764.jpeg
General Staff: Russia has lost 812,670 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 812,670 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Jan. 15.

Russia launches mass missile attack against Ukraine	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched a large-scale missile attack against Ukraine on the morning of Jan. 15, launching Kh-101, Kh-22, and Kalibr cruise missiles, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported. The Russian Defense Ministry had previously threatened to retaliate after Ukraine targeted military and industrial sites throughout Russia in a mass attack on Jan. 14. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force issued a nationwide aerial alert in the early hours of Jan. 15, following warnings that a group of Tu-95MS strategic bombers had taken flight from Russia&apos;s Olenya airfield in Murmansk Oblast. Russia also reportedly launched ballistic missiles from Belgorod Oblast. Explosions were reported in Kharkiv, Khmelnytsky Oblast, and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. In Lviv Oblast, Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said Russian forces had &quot;attacked the energy infrastructure of our region and Ukraine.&quot; There are no reports of casualties or damage at this time. Shortly after eight in the morning, the all clear was given across much of the country. Poland scrambled fighter jets due to the Russian missile threat in western Ukraine, according to the Polish Operational Command. Ukraine&apos;s state grid operator, Ukrenergo, imposed emergency blackouts as a preventative measure, Energy Minister Herman Haluschenko announced.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-mass-missile-attack-against-ukraine/	2025-01-14T22:42:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1240508647.jpg
US, Armenia sign strategic partnership agreement	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan signed a strategic partnership commission charter between the U.S and Armenia on Jan. 14 in Washington, D.C. The agreement comes as Armenia, once a close ally of Russia, moves to strengthen ties with the West amid deteriorating relations with Moscow. The charter establishes a framework for expanded bilateral cooperation between the U.S. and Armenia in the areas of economic cooperation, security and defense, and democracy, among others. &quot;We are increasingly strong partners, and I think that is for the good of both of our countries as well as the good of the region and beyond,&quot; Blinken said at the signing. The two countries are also preparing to start negotations on an agreement to support Armenia&apos;s nuclear energy sector, Blinken said. &quot;Our relations, based on shared values and mutual interests, have witnessed remarkable growth in recent years,&quot; Mirzoyan said. &#xA0; &quot;They have matured to a point where upgrading them to a strategic partnership is not only fitting but essential for navigating the complex geopolitical landscape.&quot; The strategic partnership marks Armenia&apos;s latest pro-Western foreign policy move as it continues to distance itself from Russia, its traditional ally. Relations between Russia and Armenia deteriorated rapidly after Moscow failed to prevent an Azerbaijani lighting offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh in September 2023. Yerevan has since forged deeper alliances with the U.S. and Europe, signaling interest in joining the EU and breaking from the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a Russian-led security alliance.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-armenia-sign-strategic-partnership-agreement/	2025-01-14T20:25:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/armenia.png
EU considering ban on Russian LNG, aluminum, Bloomberg reports	The European Union is considering a gradual ban on Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) and new restrictions on Russian aluminum as part of its next round of sanctions, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 14, citing undisclosed officials. The EU has begun drafting its 16th round of sanctions against Russia in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The bloc aims to approve the package on Feb. 24, the third anniversary of the all-out war. The phase-out of Russian LNG could be enacted as a sanction or part of a road map presented by the European Commission next month, people familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg. Restrictions on aluminum would be gradual, with a time frame yet to be determined. The new sanctions may also target dozens of vessels belonging to Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; &#x2014; tankers that transport Russian oil products in violation of international sanctions &#x2014; and cut more banks off from the SWIFT international payment system, Bloomberg&apos;s sources said. The draft measures are currently under discussion and subject to change before they are formally presented. The EU is still debating whether to impose restrictions on Russian LNG via sanctions or as a set of regulations within a road map, or a combination thereof, undisclosed officials and diplomats said. Sanctions, which may carry the most weight, require unanimous approval of all member states. This requirement has prevented the EU from banning Russian pipeline gas, as member nations such as Slovakia and Hungary remain heavily reliant on energy imports from Russia. The EU&apos;s largest importers of Russian LNG &#x2014;&#xA0;Spain, Belgium, and France &#x2014;&#xA0;are not expected to block sanctions against Moscow, the officials said. The EU imposed its first major restrictions on Russian gas, including LNG, in its 14th sanctions package in June 2024. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen proposed replacing Russian LNG with U.S. imports in a phone call with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in November. The 16th sanctions package comes on the heels of a joint U.S.-U.K. crackdown on Russia&apos;s oil sector and shadow fleet. The two countries on Jan. 10 imposed major restrictions on over 180 Russian tankers and a number of oil companies. Following the sanctions, 65 oil tankers around the world paused operations and remain idling offshore.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-considering-ban-on-russian-lng-aluminum-bloomberg-reports/	2025-01-14T18:50:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1775102025.jpeg
Drone hits distillery in Russia's Tambov Oblast, local media reports	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A drone struck a distillery in the village of Novaya Lyada in Russia&apos;s Tambov Oblast the night of Jan. 14, the Russian Telegram news channel Astra reported, citing local residents. Local residents said a fire broke out at the distillery, which is located near a military training ground. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Russian officials have not commented on the alleged attack at the distillery. The government of Tambov Oblast claimed that air defense units intercepted a drone over the region and that it exploded &quot;in a tree.&quot; Previous drone attacks have reportedly targeted Russian alcohol plants, including facilities in Tambov Oblast. The Biokhim distillery in the town of Rasskazovo in Tambov Oblast allegedly caught fire after being struck by a drone in October 2025. The distillery advertised its manufacture of &quot;products of strategic importance for the state,&quot; including ethanol, a solvent used in the production of explosives. The reported attack on Novaya Lyada comes a day after Ukraine launched its &quot;most massive&quot; attack against Russian military and industrial facilities, covering a range of up to 1,100 kilometers (620 miles), overnight on Jan. 13-14. Ukrainian forces successfully struck chemical plants, refineries, and the Engels airbase&apos;s ammunition depots, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/drone-hits-distillery-in-russias-tambov-oblast-local-media-reports/	2025-01-14T17:47:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2025/01/distillery.png
Putin aide claims that 'Moldova will become part of another state or cease to exist', Chisinau responds	Moldovan officials have condemned recent remarks by Nikolai Patrushev, an aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who claimed that Moldova &#x201C;will either become part of another state or cease to exist&#x201D; due to its &#x201C;anti-Russian policy,&#x201D; Moldovan media outlet NewsMaker reported on January 14. Patrushev made the controversial statement in an interview, further blaming the Moldovan government for the energy crisis and urging Chisinau to &quot;not deceive itself or its people,&quot; but instead &quot;admit its mistakes and start fixing the situation.&quot; Moldova&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry called the remarks unnaceptable interference in the internal affairs of the country. &#x201C;Moldova is a sovereign state that stands firmly on the path of democracy and European integration, in line with the will of its citizens,&#x201D; the Foreign Ministry said. The energy crisis, worsened by Russia&apos;s suspension of gas supplies in December 2024, has been labeled by Chisinau as Kremlin blackmail and a threat to national security. Moldova began sourcing electricity from European markets, resulting in significant disruptions in the Russian-controlled Transnistria region, including power outages and industrial shutdowns. Transnistrian authorities previously rejected an offer from Chisinau to help purchase gas via European platforms. While Moldova has transitioned to European energy supplies, Transnistria remains heavily reliant on Russian gas. Russian troops have been stationed in the region since the early 1990s.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-aide-claims-that-moldova-will-become-part-of-another-state-or-cease-to-exist-chisinau-responds/	2025-01-14T16:26:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2178578557.jpg
Zelensky addresses personnel transfer controversy, orders Air Force commander not to reassign specialists to Ground Forces	President Volodymyr Zelensky has addressed the controversy surrounding the reassignment of Air Force personnel to the Ground Forces, in his evening address on Jan. 14. Reports indicated that since 2024, thousands of Air Force soldiers have been transferred to the Ground Forces. The latest directive was issued on Jan. 11, when Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi issued an order to transfer over 5,000 Air Force personnel to Ground Forces units. A senior Air Force officer, speaking anonymously, said transfers have now reached a &quot;critical level,&quot; with unit staffing dropping to 50%. However, this move has sparked significant debate and concern about its impact on the Air Force&#x2019;s operational capabilities. Zelensky directed Anatolii Kryvonozhko, Commander of the Ukrainian Air Force, to ensure the Air Force maintains its required personnel levels and to address public concerns about recent transfers to the Ground Forces. &quot;There has been much concern and discussion today regarding these reassignments. I have instructed that everything be explained to the public and not to reduce the ranks of specialists critical to the Air Force &#x2013; aviation, air defense, and mobile fire units,&#x201D; he said. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine also weighed in, reassuring the public that critical engineering and aviation specialists servicing aircraft are not being transferred. Instead, selected Air Force personnel are undergoing training to address personnel shortages in infantry and other units.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-addresses-personnel-transfer-controversy-orders-air-force-commander-not-to-reassign-specialists-to-ground-forces/	2025-01-14T14:02:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188503703.jpg
