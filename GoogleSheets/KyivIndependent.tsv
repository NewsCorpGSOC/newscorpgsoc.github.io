UK targets 30 tankers in its largest sanctions package against Russia's 'shadow fleet'	The United Kingdom sanctioned 30 oil tankers of Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; that carried billions of dollars worth of oil and oil products last year, the government said on Nov. 25. &quot;Oil revenues are a crucial source of funding for the Kremlin&#x2019;s illegal war in Ukraine,&quot; the Foreign Office said in a statement. The latest sanctions follow Moscow&#x2019;s efforts to evade the West&apos;s attempts to stifle its oil revenues through the $60-per-barrel price cap imposed two years ago. &quot;Constraining these revenues, including by cracking down on the companies that insure these vessels, is vital for maintaining our shared security: degrading the Kremlin&#x2019;s war machine, clearing our shipping lanes of unsafe traffic, and protecting our international trade to make room for growth.&#x201D; the statement added. The sanctions expand the number of U.K.-sanctioned Russian vessels to 73, the biggest batch of sanctioned ships by a single Western country. The EU and U.S. have also targeted Russia&apos;s shadow fleet in previous rounds of sanctions, applying restrictions to individual tankers and shipping services. Russia has invested $10 billion to expand its shadow fleet since 2022, according to the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) Insititute. The fleet consists of old and poorly insured tankers that carried two-thirds of Russia&apos;s seaborne crude oil exports last year, the report showed.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-targets-30-tankers-in-its-largest-sanctions-package-against-russias-shadow-fleet/	2024-11-25T06:15:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1477538300.jpg
Ukraine's top energy company to receive $112 million from EU, US to restore facilities	DTEK, Ukraine&apos;s largest private energy company, will receive $112 million from the EU and the U.S. to restore facilities damaged in Russian attacks and prepare them for winter, the company said on Nov. 25. Russian attacks have destroyed 90% of DTEK&apos;s generation capacity during an aerial campaign in the spring and summer earlier this year, which aimed to knock out Ukraine&apos;s power grid. Moscow&apos;s forces launched another massive attack on Nov. 17, again targeting DTEK&apos;s power plants. The U.S. government is providing $46.1 million to purchase control systems and dozens of new transformers, while the European Commission pledged 62.8 million euros ($66 million) to restore 1.8GW of generating capacity and to protect power plant equipment from elements during the winter. &quot;The work will ensure a stable and reliable energy supply to more than 2 million Ukrainians,&quot; the company said in a press release. &quot;The United States is proud to support Ukraine&apos;s energy resilience with this critical aid package,&quot; said Geoffrey Pyatt, the assistant secretary of state for energy resources. &quot;By providing $46.1 million for control systems and new transformers, we are helping to rebuild and fortify Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure against Russia&#x2019;s unprovoked attacks.&quot; DTEK&apos;s CEO, Maksym Timchenko, said the company is &quot;deeply grateful for the unwavering support of the United States and the European Commission, and the leadership of the Ministry of Energy in delivering this vital aid.&quot; In turn, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), one of Ukraine&apos;s largest institutional investors, said it would not provide funds to DTEK due to its ownership by oligarch Rinat Akhmetov. &quot;The objective of freeing the economy from the influence of oligarchs is absolutely fundamental,&quot; EBRD President Odile Renaud-Basso said, according to the Italian publication Corriere della Sera. Akhmetov is Ukraine&apos;s wealthiest man, with vast holdings in mining and metallurgy. Formerly a lawmaker of the pro-Russian Party of Regions, the business tycoon saw a large part of his assets lost during Russia&apos;s invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/dtek-112-million-from-us-eu/	2024-11-25T05:53:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2147953041.jpeg
5 injured by Russian drone during humanitarian aid distribution in Mykolaiv Oblast	A Russian drone attacked the village of Solonchaky in Mykolaiv Oblast while humanitarian aid was being distributed there on Nov. 25, Governor Vitalii Kim reported. Five people were injured, with both aid workers and residents among the victims. All of them were taken to hospital, and two are in serious condition, the governor wrote on his Telegram channel. The attack comes five days after Russian forces struck another humanitarian aid distribution point in Novodmytrivka in Kherson Oblast, reportedly targeting a building where volunteers were distributing bread to residents. A projectile struck the roof, damaging windows, the facade, and the roof itself. No injuries were reported in that case. Earlier today, Russian forces also struck houses in central Kharkiv, injuring 23, and also struck downtown Odesa, wounding 11, local authorities reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/5-injured-by-russian-drone-in-mykolaiv-oblast/	2024-11-25T05:11:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1489471985--1-.jpg
Trump's reelection revives talks in Europe on sending military personnel to Ukraine, Le Monde reports	Donald Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. election revived discussion among European allies on sending military personnel or private defense contractors to Ukraine, Le Monde reported on Nov. 25, citing undisclosed sources. The topic was reportedly brought up during British Prime Minister Keir Starmer&apos;s visit to France on Nov. 11, as London and Paris do not rule out taking the lead in the pro-Kyiv coalition, the outlet writes. There are fears that Trump&apos;s victory might lead to the U.S. withdrawing its support for Ukraine, leaving it up to European allies to help Kyiv resist Russian aggression. French President Emmanuel Macron previously suggested deploying military trainers to Ukraine, but the idea has met strong opposition among several key allies, namely Germany. According to Le Monde, discussions on the deployment of Western troops are still ongoing, but the details remain classified. One proposal reportedly involved allowing the Defense Conseil International (DCI), a 55%-state-held defense contractor, to help train Ukrainian troops directly in Ukraine, as it already does in Poland and France. Talking to the media on Nov. 23, France&apos;s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said that the West should &quot;not set and express red lines&quot; on providing Ukraine with military support. When asked by the BBC whether sending French troops would constitute a so-called red line, Barrot said that France would &quot;not discard any option.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-france-talks-on-troop-in-ukraine/	2024-11-25T04:55:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184127273.jpg
Opinion: Nuclear escalation fears can't override Ukraine's right to defend itself	Following Donald Trump&#x2019;s victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic congresswoman from New York, publicly appealed to those who had voted for both her and Trump. She wanted to know what motivated such an apparently inconsistent choice, and the predominant answer she heard was that she and Trump seemed more sincere, whereas Vice President Kamala Harris came off as too calculating. It was a fruitful exercise, and we can ask the same of leftists who support both the Palestinians and Russia. After all, the latter has been bombing Ukrainian cities until they resemble Gaza, and just as the right-wing parties in Israel&#x2019;s government want to create a Greater Israel, the Kremlin hopes to create a Greater Russia. Russia&#x2019;s eliminationist project should thus remain top of mind whenever we assess developments on the ground. Immediately after the recent decision by U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration to allow Ukraine to launch U.S.-furnished ATACMS missiles (with a range of up to 190 miles, or 305.8 kilometers) into Russia, the Kremlin warned that any use of Western arms against the Russian Federation could trigger a nuclear response under its new nuclear doctrine. Nonetheless, the Ukrainians countered by firing six ATACMS missiles at a military facility in the Bryansk region (adjacent to the Ukrainian border) the next day. Although Russia claims that the damage was negligible &#x2014; five of the missiles were shot down, and there were no casualties &#x2014; following the letter of its new nuclear doctrine would mean that it is now at war with the United States and has the right to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine. With some of those around Trump already accusing Biden of taking a dangerous step toward a new world war, is it fair to say that Ukraine went too far? Has it disturbed the fragile balance that kept the conflict limited? Before jumping to this conclusion, one must remember that the U.S. has permitted Ukraine to target locations primarily in Kursk, the border region from which Russia has been launching many of its attacks against Ukrainian positions. As Josep Borrell, the (outgoing) EU foreign-policy chief put it: &#x201C;Ukraine should be able to use the arms we provided to them not only to stop the arrow, but also to be able to hit the archers.&#x201D; Moreover, recall that Russia had escalated its own campaign against Ukraine mere days earlier, blanketing the entire country with drone and missile attacks against civilian energy infrastructure just before the onset of winter. While six Ukrainian missiles caused panic all around the world, Russia&#x2019;s systematic destruction of Ukrainian infrastructure has been normalized &#x2014; much like Israel&#x2019;s razing of northern Gaza.

(Libkos/Getty Images)The situation is as obscene as it is absurd. Russia, having launched a war of conquest against its peaceful neighbor, now wants to keep its own territory out of the war, and it accuses Ukraine, the victim, of &#x201C;expanding&#x201D; the conflict. If Russia is serious about its new nuclear doctrine, let us offer an equally serious counter-doctrine: If an independent country is attacked with non-nuclear forces by a nuclear superpower, its allies have the right &#x2014; even the duty &#x2014; to provide it with nuclear weapons so that it has a chance of deterring an attack. It is often said that Putin wants a return to the Soviet Union and Stalinism; but this is not right. Rather, his regime is sustained by a vision of the pre-1917 imperial era, when czarist Russia&#x2019;s zone of influence encompassed not only Poland but also Finland. Time will tell if Putin&#x2019;s neo-Czarism is more than a pipe dream. In the emerging multipolar world, the rise of strong empires, each with its own zone of influence, is quite conceivable. As Putin told the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in June 2022, &#x201C;sovereignty cannot be segmented or fragmented in the 21st century.&#x201D; Upholding political sovereignty and national identity is essential, he said, but so is strengthening everything that &#x201C;determines our country&#x2019;s economic, financial, professional, and technological independence.&#x201D; Clearly, only a new imperial Russia, not Ukraine or Belarus or Finland, will be able to enjoy the full benefits of sovereignty. Making matters worse, on the same day that President Vladimir Putin announced the new Russian nuclear doctrine, the BBC reported that, &#x201C;air pollution in India&#x2019;s capital Delhi has soared to extremely severe levels, choking residents and engulfing the city in thick smog,&#x201D; disrupting air transport, forcing schools to close, and halting construction. &#x201C;And experts warn that the situation could get worse in Delhi in the coming days.&#x201D; While Russia indulges in imperial aggression and rattles its nuclear saber, hundreds of millions of people are finding it harder to breathe. Our media trumpet the use of Western weapons against Russia as front-page &#x201C;breaking news,&#x201D; and our blinkered leftists regard Ukraine&#x2019;s &#x201C;excessive&#x201D; defense as a dangerous escalation. A threat to our very survival, however, barely merits mention. Editor&#x2019;s Note: Copyright, Project Syndicate.

MP walks back his statement on number of IDPs returning to occupied territories	Ukrainian lawmaker Maksym Tkachenko said that his earlier statement about 150,000 internally displaced persons (IDP) returning to occupied territories was only his assumption, not based on real data, Ukrinform reported on Nov. 25. &quot;There is no such data. This was my unfounded and emotional assumption,&quot; Tkachenko told Ukrinform. &quot;I spoke incorrectly, so I&apos;m taking back my words,&quot; said the lawmaker who serves on a committee focused on human rights and the liberation of occupied territories. Tkachenko previously said during an interview with Ukrinform published on Nov. 24 that 150,000 IDPs have already returned to Russian-occupied territories, including 70,000 who have come back to the southern city of Mariupol. Tkachenko now explained that individual IDPs are forced to travel to occupied territories for various reasons, but &quot;it is by no means about hundreds or even tens of thousands, and general verified statistics cannot even theoretically exist.&quot; An estimated 3.7 million IDPs live in Ukraine as Russian aggression and occupation have driven them out of their homes. Many of them face difficulties securing housing and employment. The problem of mass displacement in Ukraine continues to grow as Russia&apos;s ongoing advance in the east leads to more civilian evacuations. Russia now occupies around 20% of Ukrainian territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/tkachenko-idps/	2024-11-25T04:20:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1239378487.jpg
You're repeating Russian propaganda,' Ukrainian boxing champion Klitschko responds to Joe Rogan	Ukrainian former professional boxer Wladimir Klitschko on Nov. 24 accused Joe Rogan of echoing Russian propaganda after the U.S. podcaster lambasted Washington&apos;s decision to allow Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia. &quot;You talk about sending American weapons to Ukraine, which you believe will lead to World War III. (Vladimir) Putin&#x2019;s Russia is in trouble, so Putin wants to scare you and people like you. His war was supposed to last three days. It lasted three years thanks to the heroism and sacrifice of Ukrainians,&quot; Klitschko said in the video. Rogan, one of the most popular podcasters in the U.S. with over 18 million followers on YouTube, criticized the outgoing Biden administration for allowing Ukraine to strike with Storm Shadow and ATACMS missiles deep into Russian territory earlier this month. The podcaster voiced fears that the decision could lead to World War III. &quot;How are you allowed to do that when you are on your way out. Like people don&#x2019;t want you to be there anymore, maybe that would be a good thing we would like to avoid from a dying former president. The whole thing is nuts,&quot; Rogan said in a recent episode. During the electoral campaign, Rogan endorsed Donald Trump, who has criticized military aid to Ukraine and said he would bring both sides to the negotiating table. The Biden administration has sought to speed up military support for Kyiv before Trump takes office in January. &quot;Zelensky says Putin is terrified. Fuck you, man. You fucking people are about to start World War III,&quot; Rogan said. In his video, Klitschko asked for an invitation to Rogan&#x2019;s podcast to counter his views on Ukraine and Russia. &quot;If you invite me to your podcasts, we could discuss (our misunderstandings) like free men,&quot; Klitschko said at the end of the video.	https://kyivindependent.com/joe-rogan-klitschko/	2024-11-25T03:43:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2008030057.jpg
Ukraine's 3rd Brigade says it cleared out Kharkiv Oblast village, took ex-convict POWs	Ukraine&#x2019;s Third Assault Brigade said on Nov. 25 that it had cleared out Russian troops from the Kopanky village in Kharkiv Oblast, taking several prisoners of war (POW) from Russia&#x2019;s First Tank Army. Russian forces were reportedly pushed out after they attempted to break into Kopanky, a village in eastern Kharkiv Oblast close to the administrative border with Luhansk Oblast. The settlement lies around 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Kupiansk, a key logistics hub under increasing pressure from Russian troops. In a video published by the unit, seven POWs are seen in a basement-like room during a filmed interrogation. According to the unit, the POWs&apos; positions came under artillery fire from the Russian military after their capture. Russia has been recruiting prisoners for high-risk assault operations in Ukraine to offset its staggering losses during the full-scale war. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the unit&#x2019;s claims or where the video was recorded. The Third Separate Assault Brigade is known to have been operating around the village of Borova in Kharkiv Oblast. They launched a successful counterattack in the region in August, advancing almost 2 square kilometers deep into the front line area.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-3rd-brigade-kopanky/	2024-11-25T03:12:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1244040441.jpg
Russian attacks in Ukraine injure 5 over past day, including 13-year-old boy	Russian attacks across Ukraine injured at least five civilians, including a 13-year-old boy, over the past day, regional authorities reported on the morning of Nov. 25. A Russian attack against the Koriukivka district of Chernihiv Oblast on Nov. 24 injured a 28-year-old man, according to Governor Viacheslav Chaus. Three people were injured during Russian attacks on Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Three high-rise buildings and 22 houses were damaged. A Russian drone attack against the city of Zaporizhzhia overnight on Nov. 25 injured a 13-year-old boy, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. Industrial facilities in the city were attacked. Cherkasy, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Kirovohrad, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, Sumy, Poltava, Zhytomyr, and Odesa oblasts were also attacked, but no casualties were reported. Russia continued to attack Ukraine later during the day on Nov. 25, hitting the cities of Kharkiv and Odesa with missiles and inflicting additional casualties. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 71 of the 145 Russian drones launched overnight, the Air Force said. Seventy-one other drones were &quot;lost&quot; across Ukraine, likely thanks to electronic warfare means, the statement read.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-106/	2024-11-25T02:46:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Donetsk-Oblast-Nov-25.jpg
UK national reportedly captured by Russia while fighting for Ukraine	A British national fighting for Ukraine has been captured by Russian forces in Kursk Oblast, according to multiple reports from Nov. 24. A video of a man in military fatigues, who identifies himself as former British army signalman James Scott Rhys Anderson, 22, began circulating on Russian Telegram channels on Nov. 24. In the video, the man &#x2013;&#xA0;who spoke with an English accent &#x2013; says he signed up for Ukraine&apos;s International Legion, a unit made up of foreign volunteers, after serving in the British military from 2019 to 2023. When the footage was taken remains unclear, and its authenticity could not be independently verified. The man cannot speak freely as he was recorded while captured and apparently in the presence of Russian soldiers. The Russian state news agency TASS quoted a military source claiming that a &quot;U.K. mercenary&quot; has been detained in Kursk Oblast, an embattled region on the border with Ukraine. Russia often presents foreign volunteers fighting for Ukraine as &quot;mercenaries&quot; and claims they are not entitled to protection as prisoners of war. The U.K. Foreign Office told the media it was &quot;supporting the family of a British man following reports of his detention.&quot; Scott Anderson, the 22-year-old&apos;s father, told the Daily Mail that he &quot;was in complete shock and in tears&quot; when the fighter&apos;s commander sent him the video. &quot;I could see straight away it was him. He looks frightened, scared, and worried,&quot; Scott Anderson said. Two other Britons, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, were captured by Russian forces in Mariupol in 2022 and sentenced to death before being released in a prisoner exchange. Russia has ramped up pressure in Kursk Oblast to dislodge Ukrainian troops holding positions there since early August. Reuters reported on Nov. 23 that Ukraine had lost over 40% of territory previously captured during the incursion.	https://kyivindependent.com/british-man-reportedly-captured/	2024-11-25T01:57:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168599470.jpg

Ukrainian drones hit oil depot in western Russia's Kaluga Oblast, source says	Drones operated by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) hit an oil depot in the western Russian city of Kaluga, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent on Nov. 25. The Kaluganefteprodukt oil facility, which is used to support Russian aggression in Ukraine, was struck by the drones at 0:30 a.m. on Nov. 25, leading to a series of blasts and a fire, the source claimed. Kaluga, a city of roughly 340,000 people, lies approximately 290 kilometers (180 miles) north of the Ukrainian border. Videos shared on local Telegram channels show a fire and active air defenses in the city. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage that purports to show active air defense during a drone attack in Kaluga, Kaluga Oblast, Russia, overnight on Nov. 25, 2024. (HUR source)Kaluga Oblast Governor Vladislav Shapsha claimed that eight drones were shot down overnight, resulting in a fire at an industrial facility that was later extinguished. The official did not provide further details on possible damage and said there had been no casualties. According to Andrii Kovalenko, the counter-disinformation chief at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, drones also targeted Kaluga&apos;s Taifun (Typhoon) factory, which produces radio-electronic equipment, missile and aviation components, and other military supplies. It remains unclear whether the Taifun factory suffered damage, as the target was not mentioned by the HUR source. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. Kyiv launches regular drone strikes against Russian territory, targeting military and industrial facilities to undermine Russia&apos;s war effort in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/kaluga-oil-depot/	2024-11-25T00:39:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Kaluga.png
Cargo plane crashes in Lithuania, leaving one dead	A DHL cargo plane flying from Leipzig in Germany crashed near the Vilnius Airport in Lithuania on the morning of Nov. 25, leaving one crew member dead and two injured, local media reported. The plane crashed a few kilometers south of the runway and hit a house, catching on fire. Three remaining people on board survived the crash, and 12 people were evacuated from the damaged house, according to authorities. The Boeing 737-476(SF) plane, operated by a DHL contractor Swiftair, crashed at about 5.30 a.m. local time south of the capital, officials said. Lithuanian authorities said it was too early to draw conclusions about the cause of the crash and that an investigation was underway. Two shipments from Lithuania to Leipzig caught fire earlier this year, with officials reportedly suspecting Moscow of a plot that saw several parcels sent by individuals to catch fire in Germany and the U.K. in July 2024. This could have led the cargo planes to crash if the fires happened during the flight.	https://kyivindependent.com/cargo-plane-crashes-in-vilnius/	2024-11-24T23:31:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Vilnius-Airport.jpg
Far-right Ukraine aid critic takes surprise lead in Romanian presidential election	Calin Georgescu, a far-right critic of Romania&apos;s pro-NATO and pro-Ukraine policy, is projected to enter the presidential run-off vote after a shock result in the first round on Nov. 24. Georgescu is leading the polls with 22.92% and roughly 99.9% of the vote counted, followed by center-left Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu at 19.17% and Elena Lasconi of the center-right Save Romania Union at 19.16%. The surprise outcome signals a possible shift within a country at NATO&apos;s eastern frontier that has been staunchly supportive of its Ukrainian neighbors throughout the full-scale war. Romania&apos;s head of state has a significant influence in some areas, such as foreign policy. George Simion, the leader of the far-right AUR Alliance, who has been banned from entering Ukraine over &quot;systematic anti-Ukrainian activities,&quot; is projected to come in fourth with 13.87%. The second round of the vote is scheduled to take place on Dec. 8. Georgescu has previously called for an end to Romania&apos;s support for Ukraine and lambasted the presence of a NATO missile defense station in Romania as a &quot;shame on diplomacy.&quot; Romania took a decisively pro-Ukraine stance under Ciolacu and outgoing President Klaus Iohannis, providing military, humanitarian, and economic support. The country is a key conduit for Ukraine&apos;s agricultural exports and has recently provided Ukraine with a Patriot air defense system. Romania shares a 610-kilometer (380-mile) border with Ukraine. Russian drone wreckage has been found on the Romanian side of the border on several occasions following Moscow&apos;s drone strikes against Ukrainian Danube ports, forcing Bucharest to ramp up security measures in the area. Georgescu, who has a strong presence on the TikTok social network, was considered to be a marginal candidate by previous surveys and was often not even listed among the top five presidential hopefuls. He ran as an independent candidate while a former member of the AUR Alliance. Georgescu left the party in 2022 after being criticized by his fellow party members for his overtly pro-Russian and anti-NATO views. He previously lauded Romania&apos;s World War II-era fascist leader, Ion Antonescu, as a national hero. Georgescu served as a special rapporteur in the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights and has worked as an expert in sustainable development and the environment sector.	https://kyivindependent.com/romania-elections/	2024-11-24T23:02:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Picture1.png

Polish farmers lift blockade at Ukraine border	Polish farmers, who staged a protest in the village of Medyka and blocked the Sheghini border crossing with Ukraine, have suspended their blockade, Ukraine&#x2019;s State Customs Service reported on Nov. 24. The protest lasted for just over one day, starting on Nov. 23. The decision followed a meeting with Polish Minister of Agriculture Czeslaw Siekierski, during which farmers agreed to submit their demands by Nov. 26, with the minister promising a response by December 10. The blockade had restricted truck traffic from Ukraine, with only one truck per hour permitted from Poland to Ukraine. However, vehicles like buses, cars, humanitarian aid, and military convoys were allowed through. Farmers were protesting the Polish government&apos;s failure to maintain the agricultural tax rate in 2024 at the same level as in 2023, according to RMF24. They were also reportedly protesting over concerns about the European Union signing a free trade agreement with South American countries in the Mercosur bloc. &#x201C;We want to put pressure on the government to prevent this agreement from being reached,&#x201D; said Roman Kondrov, a protest organizer. As of November 24, truck traffic at the crossing has been fully restored, according to Ukraine&apos;s State Customs Service. Polish farmers have staged multiple protests at border crossings between Poland and Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war, including protests against Ukrainian agricultural imports in the EU.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-farmers-lift-blockade-at-ukraine-border/	2024-11-24T20:46:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2025718523--1-.jpg
Putin signs law prohibiting adoption of Russian children by citizens of countries that permit gender transition	Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law banning the adoption of Russian children by citizens of countries where gender transitioning is legal, the Russian government&#x2019;s legal information website published on Nov. 23. The law targeted at least 15 countries, including several in Europe, as well as Australia, Argentina, and Canada. Additional legislation approved on the same day prohibits promoting child-free lifestyles and imposes fines of up to 5 million rubles (about $50,000) for spreading such messages, framed as part of a Western agenda to weaken Russia. These moves align with Russia&apos;s broader recent push for &quot;traditional values,&quot; highlighted by past laws banning gender-transition procedures, LGBTQ+ information, and declaring LGBTQ+ activism as &#x2018;extremist.&#x2019; Putin has increasingly criticized Western liberal ideologies, describing them as a threat to Russia. The crackdown on dissent, activists, and independent media in Russia has escalated, especially since the war in Ukraine began in 2022. In November 2023, Russian Supreme Court&apos;s decision to label the &quot;international LGBT movement&quot; as &quot;extremist,&quot; has starkly intensified the challenges faced by the LGBTQ+ community in general within the country. This ruling, emerging from a lawsuit by the Justice Ministry accusing the LGBT movement of inciting social and religious discord, has effectively jeopardized all forms of LGBTQ+ rights activism in Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-signs-law-prohibiting-adoption-of-russian-children-by-citizens-of-countries-that-permit-gender-transition/	2024-11-24T19:02:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185213511.jpg
Ukraine developing guided aerial bombs domestically, Chief of Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff says	Ukraine is actively working on developing its own guided aerial bombs, Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Anatolii Barhylevych reported on Nov. 24. &quot;We are actively working on it. I think we will achieve such success,&quot; he said during a telethon on the air of Yedyni Novyny. Barhylevych pointed out that Russia holds the largest stockpile of aerial bombs inherited from the Soviet Union. Guided aerial bombs are precision-guided munitions that have a shorter range than missiles but are far cheaper to produce. When launched from aircraft within Russian territory or Russian-occupied territories, they are beyond the reach of Ukrainian air defense. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Oct. 21 that Ukraine has invested more than $4 billion in its defense production and urged international partners to invest further, recalling the recent successes of Ukrainian specialists in drone manufacturing.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-developing-guided-aerial-bombs-domestically-chief-of-ukrainian-armed-forces-general-staff-says/	2024-11-24T17:12:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1243505779.jpg
Lithuania delivers new military aid package to Ukraine	Lithuania has delivered another military aid package to Ukraine, Lithuania&#x2019;s Ministry of National Defense reported on Nov. 24. The aid package included generators, M113 spare parts, weapons, and ammunition, according to the ministry&apos;s post on X. &#x201C;Lithuania continues its unwavering support for Ukraine,&#x201D; the ministry said. &#x201C;Whatever it takes for Ukraine to win. Solidarity remains steadfast.&#x201D; Additionally, on November 23, the defense ministers of both countries signed a memorandum in Vilnius to establish a mechanism for supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s security. The agreement includes Lithuanian funding for the production of Ukrainian long-range drones. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and his Lithuanian counterpart also reportedly discussed plans to equip Ukrainian brigades, provide ammunition, strengthen air defense, and expand defense industry cooperation between the two countries as &quot;key priorities&quot; for 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-delivers-new-military-aid-package-to-ukraine/	2024-11-24T15:18:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/Zelensky-in-Lithuania.jpeg
UK businessman faces no charges after admitting to violating Russia sanctions	U.K. businessman David Crisp will not face criminal charges after he was caught on camera admitting to selling luxury perfume in Russia despite government sanctions, the BBC reported on Nov. 24. Crisp was arrested in 2023 by the U.K. agency responsible for sanctions enforcement, but the investigation was dropped earlier in 2024. There have been no criminal convictions in the U.K. for violating sanctions against Russia since the launch of the full-scale invasion, according to the BBC. A private investigator filmed Crisp confessing that he knowingly ignored trade sanctions in order to sell high-end perfume in Russia. The video, previously only shown in court, was obtained by the BBC. The investigator, posing as a Las Vegas businessman, asked Crisp about his dealings in Russia during a conversation in Dallas in July 2023. &quot;Don&apos;t tell anyone,&quot; Crisp said. &quot;We&apos;re doing really well. ... We ignore government edicts. They said we shouldn&apos;t, weren&apos;t allowed to trade there.&quot; Crisp told the agent that sales in Russia in 2023 were the same as in previous years, but that getting products to Russia &#x2014; including bottles of perfume worth over $1,200 &#x2014; was becoming increasingly challenging. The U.K. imposed sanctions against Russia following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The restricitions specifically include bans on luxury perfume products. Crisp&apos;s former business partner, David Garofalo, hired the undercover investigator after he became suspicious that Crisp was continuing to sell to Russian customers in violation of sanctions. Garofolo described Crisp&apos;s statements in the video as &quot;sickening.&quot; &quot;He had actually gone out of his way to disguise the fact that he&#x2019;d continued selling to Russia,&quot; Garofalo told the BBC. &quot;He had deceived our in-house lawyer and misled our auditors.&quot; After Crisp&apos;s arrest, Garofolo took over full control of the company and halted all sales to Russia. Despite the evidence against Crisp, which also included company paperwork and international shipping data, the investigation against him was dropped in July 2024. The U.K.&apos;s HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) agency said it would take no further action against Crisp. Crisp is alleged to have hidden over $2.1 million in illegal sales to Russia. U.K. lawmaker Iain Duncan Smith criticized the government&apos;s track record on sanctions enforcement. &quot;In terms of prosecution and seriously pursuing people over sanctions, the U.K. is very poor indeed,&quot; Smith said. &quot;If we don&apos;t prosecute, who the hell is deterred from breaching sanctions?&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-businessman-faces-no-charges-after-admitting-to-violating-russia-sanctions/	2024-11-24T13:33:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-502473916.jpg
Russia preparing to break through to southern Donetsk Oblast, military says	Russian forces are preparing to break through to the southern part of Donetsk Oblast, Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command, said on Nov. 24. Kyiv has been warning of a potential Russian offensive in the south, as Moscow&apos;s troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s eastern regions. &quot;The enemy is trying to break through to the south of Donetsk region, where Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts meet,&quot; Voloshyn told Apostrophe TV. Voloshyn said the push would likely concentrate around Velyka Novosilka, one of the largest settlements in the area. Russian troops are also gearing up for assault operations in the direction of Orikhiv and Huliaipole in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. &quot;There is a high probability that the enemy will also launch assault operations, trying to break into our defense,&quot; he said. Russian forces are creating assault groups, transferring ammunition, and conducting aerial reconnaissance with drones, Voloshyn said, citing Ukrainian intelligence. These actions signal preparations for an upcoming offensive. &quot;In addition, the enemy is actively trying to hit the previously scouted areas in these areas... and is finding out where our firepower is located, trying to suppress and destroy it to make it easier for them to conduct assault operations,&quot; he said. Ukrainian forces have been preparing for a Russian push in the south. Voloshyn on Nov. 12 said that Russia could launch a renewed assault on Zaporizhzhia Oblast &quot;any day.&quot; Ukraine is busy building heavy fortifications near Zaporizhzhia, the military told the Economist on Nov. 24. Earlier in October, Voloshyn said that Russian forces were massing for a breakthrough in the direction of Orikhiv and Mala Tokmachka in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The area was the main axis of Ukraine&apos;s southern counteroffensive in 2023, which led to the liberation of the settlement of Robotyne but achieved no major results. Russia is currently gaining territory in eastern Ukraine at a rapid rate, seizing towns in Donetsk Oblast at the cost of heavy personnel losses. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Nov. 2. that Ukraine is now facing &quot;one of the most powerful&quot; Russian offensives since the start of the all-out war.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-preparing-to-break-through-to-southern-donetsk-oblast-military-says/	2024-11-24T12:36:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1997061526.jpg
Air defense systems can counter Russia's Oreshnik missile, Zelensky says	There are already air defense systems that can successfully take down missiles like the &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; Russia&apos;s new intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address on Nov. 24. Russia first launched the weapon in an attack against Dnipro on Nov. 21. Shortly thereafter, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that &quot;there are currently no ways of countering this weapon.&quot; Zelensky contradicted Putin&apos;s claim on Nov. 24, saying experts were currently analyzing the wreckage of the missile and working with allies to put together a suitable response. &quot;The world has air defense systems capable of countering such threats,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Everyone must focus on this. Russia must feel that every step it takes to expand the war has consequences for it.&quot; Ukraine is working with international partners &quot;to find a response together to this latest Russian escalation,&quot; he said. Since Putin&apos;s announcement unveiling the Oreshnik missile, experts have called into question his claims regarding the weapon&apos;s novelty. Analysts, including Pentagon officials, have said the missile appears to be based heavily on Russia&apos;s RS-26 Rubezh IRBM. In the wake of the Dnipro strike, Zelensky on Nov. 22 directed Defense Minister Rustem Umerov to engage with international partners on acquiring advanced air defense systems. Russia&apos;s IRBM attack followed Kyiv&apos;s first reported strike first successful strike on a military target on Russian soil using U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles. The Kremlin previously threatened to &quot;respond accordingly&quot; to long-range strikes with American weapons. Zelensky said on Nov. 24 it was crucial for allies to respond swiftly and increase pressure on Russia. &quot;Putin cannot be given a single week to adapt or find countermeasures,&quot; he said. &quot;We must consistently do everything to force Russia into seeking peace &#x2014; true peace.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/air-defense-systems-can-counter-russias-oreshnik-missile-zelensky-says/	2024-11-24T11:27:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178140389.jpg
Trump's top security pick calls for end to escalation in Ukraine	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s nominee for national security adviser, Mike Waltz, said on Nov. 24 that escalation between Russia and Ukraine must come to a &quot;responsible end.&quot; Waltz, like Trump, has expressed skepticism about ongoing U.S. military aid to Ukraine amid Russia&apos;s full-scale war. As national security adviser, he will play a key role in Trump&apos;s stated plan to bring about a negotiated end to the war. &quot;The President-elect has been very concerned about the escalation and where it&apos;s all going. ... We need to bring this to a responsible end,&quot; Waltz said in an interview with Fox News on Nov. 24. &quot;We need to restore deterrence, restore peace, and get ahead of this escalation ladder, rather than responding to it.&quot; Waltz&apos;s comments come as outgoing President Joe Biden looks for ways to shore up support for Ukraine ahead of Trump&apos;s inauguration. In recent days, the Biden administration has made a series of decisions aimed at giving Kyiv leverage in future negotiations. These steps including approving the delivery of anti-personnel mines and granting permission for Ukraine to launch U.S.-made long-range ATACMS at targets within Russia. Waltz criticized Biden&apos;s decision to send anti-personnel mines, comparing it to &quot;World War I trench warfare.&quot; Despite this criticism, Waltz said he and his transition team were collaborating with the current administration and that he had met with current U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. &quot;Jake Sullivan and I have had discussions, we&apos;ve met,&quot; Waltz said. &quot;For our adversaries out there that think this is a time of opportunity, that they can play one administration off the other &#x2014; they are wrong.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-top-security-pick-calls-for-end-to-escalation-in-ukraine/	2024-11-24T10:44:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2173993733.jpg
Russia’s ballistic missile test and Musk’s mockery of Zelensky | Ukraine This Week	In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Anna Belokur reports on Russia&#x2019;s recent missile strike using a new ballistic weapon. Meanwhile, Twitter owner and Donald Trump ally Elon Musk throws an online jab at President Volodymyr Zelensky.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-ballistic-missile-test-and-musks-mockery-of-zelensky-ukraine-this-week/	2024-11-24T10:07:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/IMG_9958.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine has lost over 40% of territory previously gained in Kursk incursion, Reuters reports	Key developments on Nov. 23-24: Ukraine has lost over 40 percent of the territory it previously gained in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast due to Russian counterattacks, Reuters reported on Nov. 23, citing a source in Ukraine&apos;s General Staff. &quot;At most, we controlled about 1,376 square kilometres, now of course this territory is smaller. The enemy is increasing its counterattacks,&quot; the source told Reuters. &quot;Now we control approximately 800 square kilometres. We will hold this territory for as long as is militarily appropriate.&quot; Ukraine first gained a foothold in Kursk Oblast during a surprise incursion into the Russian region in early August. Since then, Russia has launched extensive counterattacks in an effort to take back the region. NATO allies believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin is aiming to recapture territory lost in Kursk Oblast before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20, hoping to gain leverage in future peace negotiations, The Telegraph reported. The source added that nearly 60,000 Russian army personnel are currently stationed in Kursk Oblast, planning to reach the border with Sumy Oblast to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; there, as Ukraine looked to do with its incursion into Kursk Oblast. Kyiv has previously said that about 11,000 North Korean soldiers have joined the counteroffensive in Kursk, with the General Staff source noting that the majority of North Korean soldiers was finalizing training along Russian forces. The Kyiv Independent has not been able to verify the information provided by the General Staff source. As Russia&apos;s attempt to take back Kursk continues to progress, Russia has also intensified its attacks along the eastern front in recent weeks, putting Ukrainian forces under mounting pressure as they struggle to defend key positions. Western allies should &quot;not set and express red lines&quot; on providing Ukraine with military support against Russian aggression, France&apos;s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told the BBC in an excerpt of an interview published on Nov. 23 . The comments come just days after U.S. President Joe Biden approved Ukraine&apos;s use of U.S.-supplied long-range missile to strike targets within Russia, many months after President Volodymyr Zelensky first made the request. Barrot stated that Ukraine could use French-supplied long-range missiles &quot;in the logics of self defense&quot; to strike targets within Russia, but did not elaborate as to whether Kyiv has already used the French-provided weapons. &quot;(France) will support Ukraine as intensely and as long as necessary,&quot; Barrot said. &quot;Why? Because it is our security that is at stake. Each time the Russian army progresses by one square kilometer, the threat gets one square kilometer closer to Europe.&quot; During the interview Barrot also hinted France may eventually invite Ukraine to join NATO as part of Zelensky&apos;s five-point victory plan. &quot;We are open to extending an invitation, and so in our discussions with friends and allies, and friends and allies of Ukraine, we are working to get them to closer to our positions,&quot; he said. Days before Biden granted approval to use ATACMS in Russia, the leaders of France and the U.K. met in Paris on Nov. 11 to discuss a last-ditch attempt to persuade the U.S. to allow Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia with Western weapons before Donald Trump enters the White House in January. Over the past week, Russia has launched over 800 KAB-guided aerial bombs, nearly 460 attack drones, and more than 20 missiles, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 24. &quot;The air raid siren has sounded almost daily across Ukraine this week. Only last night, our air defense forces managed to shoot down about 50 attack drones,&quot; Zelensky wrote on Telegram, sharing a video showing Russian attacks across the country. On the morning of Nov. 21, Russia unveiled a new intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), dubbed &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; in an attack targeting the city of Dnipro in eastern Ukraine. &quot;Ukraine is not a testing ground for weapons. Ukraine is a sovereign, independent state. Yet Russia persists in its attempts to destroy our people, spread fear and panic, and weaken us,&quot; Zelensky said. He also reiterated the urgent need for bolstered air defenses. &quot;Ukraine needs more air defense systems, and we are working on this with our partners. It is crucial to strengthen the protection of our sky,&quot; he said. On Nov. 22, Zelensky instructed Defense Minister Rustem Umerov to engage with international allies to acquire advanced air defense capabilities. The IRBM attack followed Ukraine&#x2019;s reported first successful strike on a military target within Russian territory using U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles. Unlike cruise missiles, IRBMs are guided only in the initial phase of launch, making them less precise. However, their exceptional speed &#x2014; often exceeding 3,200 kilometers per hour as they near their targets &#x2014; makes them a formidable threat. Russia has recruited hundreds of mercenaries from Yemen to fight in its war against Ukraine, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Nov. 24. The recruits told the FT they had been promised lucrative jobs, &quot;high salaries,&quot; and even Russian citizenship. However, after arriving in Russia with the help of a Houthi-linked company, they were &quot;forcibly inducted into the Russian army and sent to the front lines in Ukraine,&quot; according to the report. The FT described the operation as a &quot;shadowy trafficking operation,&quot; underscoring the deepening ties between the Kremlin and Yemen&apos;s Iran-backed Houthi militants. Since the start of its full-scale invasion, Moscow has relied on various methods to enlist migrants and foreign nationals to offset its heavy battlefield losses while avoiding full-scale mobilization. Reports indicate that Russia has recruited individuals from Nepal, Somalia, India, Cuba, and other nations. North Korea has also sent an estimated 10,000 troops to Russia, many of whom are stationed in the western Kursk Oblast and engaged in combat, a Pentagon spokesperson said during a Nov. 12 briefing. In October, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) revealed that Yemen&apos;s Houthi militants have been using Russian satellite data to target ships in the Red Sea with drones and missiles. The targeting information was reportedly provided through Iran&apos;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, enabling the Houthis to expand their strikes. This collaboration demonstrates how far Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to go to destabilize the Western political and economic order, the WSJ reported. Analysts suggest that Moscow aims to foment unrest from the Middle East to Asia to distract the United States. According to the FT, U.S. Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking confirmed that Russia is &quot;actively pursuing contacts&quot; with the Houthis, including discussions involving weapons transfers. While Lenderking declined to elaborate, he noted that Russian personnel in Sana&apos;a are facilitating this dialogue. &quot;The kinds of weapons being discussed are very alarming and would enable the Houthis to better target ships in the Red Sea and potentially beyond,&quot; Lenderking told the FT.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-has-lost-over-40-of-territory-previously-gained-in-kursk-incursion-reuters-reports/	2024-11-24T09:39:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166312696.jpg
The Week Ahead: Key Developments Impacting Global Politics & Markets	Editor&apos;s note: This article is a shortened on-site version of KI Insights&apos; The Week Ahead newsletter covering events from Nov. 24-Nov. 30. Sign up here to start your week with an agenda of Ukraine-related events, delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday.It is Thanksgiving next week. Expect significant disruptions to the business and political cycles. Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, Andriy Yermak, is expected to travel to the US, aiming to meet with Trump and present an updated victory plan. We believe President-elect Donald Trump has challenged Zelensky&#x2019;s initial victory plan. Expect Yermak&#x2019;s overtures to include proposals on lend-lease terms for further military supplies, on business cooperation and mineral rights for American companies (incl. various sweeteners directed specifically at Elon Musk), and on using Ukrainian troops to replace US forces across Europe. In Romania, the first round of presidential elections, on Nov. 24, is expected to be close. Former far-right football hooligan and founder of the populist Alliance of the Union of Romanians George Simion has surged in the polls to almost 19%. While front-runner Social Democrat Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu is expected to comfortably win the first round, splitting of the center-right vote between rival candidates could allow Simion to make it to the final runoff. Montreal&#x2019;s NATO Parliamentary Session ends on Monday, Nov. 25 amidst growing fears of Russian hybrid warfare across Europe. Expect the recent sabotage of key communications cables in the Baltic and Trump&#x2019;s post-inauguration plans to be top of the agenda.

150,000 Ukrainian IDPs have returned to occupied regions, MP says	About 150,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) have already returned to Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine, lawmaker Maksym Tkachenko said in an interview with the news outlet Ukrinform published Nov. 24. There are nearly 5 million IDPs currently registered in Ukraine, including 3.6 million who fled or were forced from their homes after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, according to the Social Policy Ministery. &quot;About 150,000 internally displaced persons have already returned to the temporarily occupied territories,&quot; said Tkachenko, who serves in the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s parliament, on a committee focused on human rights and the liberation of occupied territories. The figure includes around 70,000 who have returned to the southern city of Mariupol, which was occupied by Russian forces in May 2022 after a months-long siege. Of the approximately 200,000 people who fled Mariupol after the launch of the full-scale war, one third have now returned to the occupied city, Tkachenko said. &quot;According to estimates, this is approximately 67-70,000 people. In my opinion, these are terrible figures,&quot; he said. Inadequate support from the state is part of what prompts people to return to Russian-occupied areas, Tkachenko said. IDPs require more resources and government assistance in order to integrate into new communities. Many IDPs face difficulties securing housing and employment after fleeing their homes. The problem of mass displacement in Ukraine continues to grow, as Russia&apos;s ongoing advance in the east leads to more civilian evacuations. Russia now occupies around 25% of Ukrainian territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/150-000-ukrainian-idps-have-returned-to-occupied-regions-mp-says/	2024-11-24T09:01:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178506540.jpg
Russian troops kill 2 civilian women, injure man in Donetsk Oblast's Toretsk, prosecutors say	Russian troops fatally shot two civilian women and injured a man in Toretsk, Donetsk Oblast, the regional prosecutor&#x2019;s office reported on Nov. 24. According to the report, at around 6 p.m. on Nov. 21, Russian soldiers entered an apartment in a residential area of Toretsk and &quot;deliberately&quot; opened fire with automatic weapons on three civilians. Two women were killed on the spot, while a man sustained injuries, including fractures to his shoulder and collarbone. An investigation into the incident has been launched, the prosecutor&apos;s office said. Toretsk has emerged as one of the hottest areas in Donetsk Oblast in recent months as Russian forces press their offensive in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine has accused Russian troops of committing over 137,000 war crimes since the start of the full-scale invasion. These include the mass abduction of Ukrainian children, the torture of civilians in occupied areas, and widespread killings.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-kill-2-civilian-women-injure-man-in-donetsk-oblasts-toretsk-prosecutors-say/	2024-11-24T07:01:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2162608242.jpg

Unlike cruise missiles, IRBMs are guided only in the initial phase of launch, making them less precise. However, their exceptional speed &#x2014; often exceeding 3,200 kilometers per hour as they near their targets &#x2014; makes them a formidable threat.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-attacked-ukraine-with-over-800-kab-bombs-460-drones-20-missiles-this-week-zelensky-says/	2024-11-24T02:00:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185712185.jpg
Ukraine downs 50 of 73 Russian drones in overnight attack, Air Force says	Ukraine shot down 50 of the 73 drones launched by Russia overnight on Nov. 24, the Air Force reported. Russia reportedly targeted Ukraine with Shahed drones and an unspecified type of drone launched from the Russian oblasts of Oryol and Bryansk. The drones were downed over Kyiv, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Chernihiv, Sumy, Poltava, and Zhytomyr oblasts, according to the Air Force. There have been no reports of casualties or damage. As of 9 a.m. local time, four Russian drones remained in Ukrainian airspace, with combat operations ongoing. Kyiv authorities reported in the morning that air defense forces shot down more than a dozen drones targeting the capital. &quot;Preliminary reports indicate no damage in the capital, and no information about casualties has been received,&quot; the Kyiv City Military Administration wrote on Telegram. Russia has increased large-scale drone attacks on Ukrainian cities, depleting Ukraine&apos;s air defense systems and targeting critical infrastructure. On Nov. 17, Russian forces launched one of the heaviest aerial strikes of the full-scale war, primarily targeting the energy grid. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 102 of the 120 missiles and 42 of the 90 drones launched overnight. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), reported on Nov. 18 that Russian forces are using cheap decoy drones with foreign components to overload Ukraine&apos;s air defense systems. According to HUR, Russian manufacturers produce the Gerbera drone &#x2014; a cheaper and less deadly equivalent of Iran&apos;s Shahed &#x2014; at a plant in Yelabuga, in the Republic of Tatarstan, central Russia. These drones are reportedly made with components from the United States, China, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-downs-50-of-73-russian-drones-in-overnight-attack-air-force-says/	2024-11-24T00:20:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/shahed.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 730,740 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 730,740 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Nov. 24. This number includes 1,020 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,423 tanks, 19,209 armored fighting vehicles, 29,864 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,765 artillery systems, 1,254 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,004 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 19,366 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-730-740-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-11-24T00:10:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183828650-1.jpg
Nearly 22,000 civilians have been evacuated from Kharkiv Oblast in 6 months, governor says	Nearly 22,000 residents have been evacuated from Kharkiv Oblast since May, with efforts ongoing to evacuate more residents from settlements near the front line, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov said on Nov. 23. &quot;We are continuing evacuation efforts, bringing both children and adults to safety,&quot; Syniehubov said on air. Kharkiv Oblast has endured constant Russian attacks for over two and a half years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Syniehubov noted that the most targeted areas include the Vovchansk direction in the Chuhuiv district, the Lyptsi area, and the Kupiansk direction. The city of Kupiansk was briefly captured by Russian forces in 2022 before being reclaimed by Ukrainian troops. Its strategic value lies in its position as a key logistics and transportation hub, with several major highways and five railway lines converging within the city. The governor added that evacuees are being provided with humanitarian aid, psychological support, and financial assistance in relatively safe areas, including the city of Kharkiv, located less than 30 kilometers from the Russian border.	https://kyivindependent.com/nearly-22-000-civilians-evacuated-from-kharkiv-oblast-in-6-months-governor-says/	2024-11-23T21:50:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1973286879.jpg
Taiwan’s former president urges US to prioritize aiding Ukraine over Taiwan, Politico reports	Former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen emphasized the importance of U.S. support for Ukraine during the Halifax International Security Forum on Nov. 23, urging Washington to prioritize helping Kyiv despite the rising threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. &quot;They should do whatever they can to help the Ukrainians,&quot; Tsai said, according to a Politico report. &quot;We [Taiwan] still have time.&quot; Tsai&#x2019;s comments came after U.S. Indo-Pacific Command chief Adm. Samuel Paparo acknowledged that aiding Ukraine has begun to strain the U.S. military&#x2019;s capacity to prepare for potential conflict in Asia. Paparo highlighted the depletion of critical weapon stockpiles, including Patriots and air-to-air missiles. During her Halifax appearance, Tsai argued that Ukraine&apos;s success against Russian aggression would serve as a global deterrent. &quot;A Ukrainian victory will serve as the most effective deterrent to future aggression,&quot; she said. Taiwan has increased its defense spending by 80% over the past eight years, reaching $19 billion in 2024. However, Tsai dismissed calls for Taiwan to raise its defense budget to 10% of GDP, a suggestion made by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. &quot;We would have some difficulty accepting an arbitrary figure,&quot; she said, according to Politico. While the Biden administration has consistently defended its ability to balance support for Ukraine and preparations for a conflict with China, Trump allies argue otherwise. Tsai remained cautious about Taiwan&apos;s defense strategy under Trump&#x2019;s presidency, declining to comment on potential major arms purchases in early 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/taiwans-former-president-urges-us-to-prioritize-aiding-ukraine-over-taiwan-politico-reports/	2024-11-23T20:37:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2153264373.jpg
Mediazona confirms identities of almost 80,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine	Mediazona, an independent Russian outlet, together with BBC Russia, has confirmed through open-source research the names of 79,819 Russian soldiers killed since the start of Russia&apos;s all-out war. As Vladimir Putin boasted the new Oreshnik nuclear-capable intermediate-range ballistic missile, sparking renewed fears of nuclear escalation, Mediazona reported nearly 2,700 additional Russian military deaths in Ukraine over the past two weeks. The confirmed death toll now includes 17,000 volunteers, 14,500 recruited prisoners, and 9,700 mobilized soldiers, according to the media outlets. The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, regional media reports, and statements from local authorities. The Nov. 22 report comes amid growing evidence of widespread violence within Russian military ranks. Recent incidents include the arrests of two commanders, known by the call signs Bely (&quot;White&quot;) and Gvozd (&quot;Nail&quot;), for confining subordinates in dog cages and the death of pro-Kremlin American volunteer Russell Bentley in a military detention facility. Since Russia began its full-scale on Feb. 22, 2022, over 4,364 Russian officers have been killed in combat in Ukraine. According to figures released by Kyiv, total Russian losses in Ukraine had exceeded 700,000 as of Nov. 4, marking an increase of 100,000 in just 77 days. The figures do not distinguish between those killed, wounded, missing, or captured, though they are widely understood to encompass all categories. These numbers mostly align with estimates from Western nations.	https://kyivindependent.com/mediazona-confirms-identities-of-almost-80-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine/	2024-11-23T18:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2159525304.jpg
Ukraine faces wave of attacks with North Korean missiles with Western components, CNN reports	Russia has ramped up its use of North Korean ballistic missiles in strikes against Ukraine, with approximately a third of its 2024 attacks involving these weapons, according to Ukrainian military officials and public records analyzed by CNN. The missiles, powered by Western-made components despite international sanctions, highlight a growing collaboration between Moscow and Pyongyang. North Korea&#x2019;s role in supporting Russia extends beyond weapons, with about 11,000 North Korean soldiers reportedly deployed to Russia&#x2019;s Kursk region. In 2024, Russia launched around 60 North Korean KN-23 missiles, accounting for nearly one-third of the 194 ballistic missile strikes tracked by Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force. August and September saw a surge in these attacks, with Ukrainian officials publicly identifying the KN-23 as a significant threat during that period. &quot;Since the spring, Russia has been using ballistic missiles and attack drones much more to strike Ukraine, and less use of cruise missiles,&quot; Yuriy Ihnat, acting head of communications for Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force, told CNN. Ukrainian investigators have uncovered evidence of extensive use of Western components in the KN-23 missiles. According to Ukraine&#x2019;s Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (NAKO), nine Western companies, including manufacturers from the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, produced key components for these weapons. &quot;Everything that works to guide the missile, to make it fly, is all foreign components. All the electronics are foreign. There is nothing Korean in it,&quot; Andriy Kulchytskyi, head of the Military Research Laboratory at Kyiv&#x2019;s Scientific Research Institute of Forensic Expertise, told CNN. He noted that the missiles&#x2019; metal casing, which corrodes quickly, appears to be the only Korean-made part. Fragments of the missiles, some produced as recently as 2023, suggest a rapid supply chain funneling components to North Korea. Ukrainian Defense Intelligence officials estimate that about 70% of these parts are American, with the rest sourced from Germany, Switzerland, and other countries. A U.K.-based investigative group, Conflict Armament Research (CAR), previously found that 75% of components in one early KN-23 missile used against Ukraine came from U.S. companies. Missile strikes involving North Korean weapons have killed at least 28 people and injured 213 in Ukraine this year, according to the Ukrainian prosecutor general. &quot;Investigating these missiles isn&#x2019;t easy due to the damage, but we can still identify the vast majority of components as Western-made,&quot; said a Ukrainian defense intelligence official. The exact routes by which components reach North Korea remain unclear, according to weapons-tracing experts, though evidence strongly suggests China as the primary conduit. &quot;We have successfully traced some of those components, and the last known custodians are Chinese companies,&quot; said Damien Spleeters, deputy director of operations at Conflict Armament Research (CAR), an organization that independently tracks diverted weapons. According to Spleeters, Chinese firms acquire the components from manufacturers and pass them through a network of intermediaries.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-faces-wave-of-attacks-with-north-korean-missiles-with-western-components-cnn-reports/	2024-11-23T17:32:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185328948.jpg
Zelensky criticizes Brazil, G20 leaders for showing 'weak position on war'	President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized Group of 20 (G20) leaders on Nov. 23 following the most recent summit in Brazil, adding that Brazilian President Lula da Silva, the current holder of the G20 Presidency, showed a &quot;weak position&quot; on Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. The group, which includes Russia among its members, also includes a number of countries who have contributed to Russia&apos;s economic development throughout its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including China and India. Despite ongoing divisions among G20 nations regarding the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, negotiators managed to reach a consensus on a statement that broadly condemned the human suffering caused by both wars. For the first time since Russia&apos;s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the leaders even came together for a group photo. The communiqu&#xE9; acknowledged the toll of the war in Ukraine and advocated for peace, yet stopped short of directly naming Russia. &quot;If we want good, normal relations between our nations, between our peoples, then, we should probably support people first, not aggressors, leaders of aggression in the world, like (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, like today&apos;s modern Russia,&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky added that a lack of a strong, unified condemnation by G20 leaders led Putin to strike Ukraine with new weapons, including Russia&apos;s use of the new type of intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) against Dnipro on Nov. 21. &quot;Without a clear stance from major countries &#x2013; the United States, Brazil, Asian and African states &#x2013; agreements with Putin will amount to mere stalling tactics and further intimidation by Russia,&quot; the Presidential Office wrote in a news release.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-criticizes-brazil-g20-leaders-for-showing-weak-position-on-war/	2024-11-23T15:00:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1636007322.jpg
Russia damaged over 300 port facilities, 20 foreign vessels in the past year, Zelensky says	Russia has damaged 321 port infrastructure facilities, as well as 20 foreign merchant vessels since July 2023, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 23 at the International Conference on Food Security in Kyiv. Traveling along the Black Sea route, ships are regularly at risk of being attacked by Russia. Since the beginning of the all-out war, mines have also been drifting along the trade route, which also poses a risk to maritime transport. As a major grain producer, Ukraine exports about 6 million tons of grain per month through ports along the Black Sea. Following an initial blockade at the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Russia unilaterally terminated the Black Sea grain deal last year forcing Kyiv to set up a new export route in the Black Sea. Initially envisioned as a humanitarian corridor to allow the departure of ships stranded there since the start of the full-scale war, it has since grown into a full-blown trade route. Last month, Russian forces struck a foreign civilian ships in Odesa, killing a 60 year-old Ukrainian port employee and injuring five foreign nationals. &quot;By attacking civilian vessels, Russia tries to weaken Ukraine&#x2019;s economy and put millions around the world at risk of hunger,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote on social media following the attack in October. Speaking at the Grain from Ukraine conference during a program that included journalists from 10 different African countries, Zelensky said that the country&apos;s &quot;food exports provide food for 400 million people in 100 countries around the world.&quot; &quot;Food prices in Egypt, Libya, Nigeria, and other countries in Africa directly depend on whether farmers and agricultural companies in Ukraine can operate normally,&quot; Zelensky added. Attempting to strengthen ties with African nations amid Russia&apos;s continued influence in the region, Zelensky said that seven of the ten embassies that the country announced it was opening in African nations in December 2022 have already been opened, with an additional three opening in the near future.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-damaged-over-300-port-facilities-20-foreign-vessels-in-the-past-year-zelensky-says/	2024-11-23T12:36:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1243863298.jpg
West should 'not set red lines' on providing military support for Ukraine, French foreign minister says	France&apos;s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told the BBC in an excerpt of an interview published on Nov. 23 that Western allies should &quot;not set and express red lines&quot; on providing Ukraine with military support against Russian aggression. The comments come just days after U.S. President Joe Biden approved Ukraine&apos;s use of U.S.-supplied long-range missile to strike targets within Russia, many months after President Volodymyr Zelensky first made the request. Days before the approval, the leaders of France and the U.K. met in Paris on Nov. 11 to discuss a last-ditch attempt to persuade the U.S. to allow Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia with Western weapons before Donald Trump enters the White House in January. Barrot&apos;s comments come as EU Parliament President Roberta Metsola, on Nov. 23, also called on German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to send long-range Taurus missiles to Ukraine &#x2014; even as Scholz has repeatedly denied the possibility of supplying Ukraine with the weaponry, fearing that Germany would be brought into the war with Russia. &quot;(France) will support Ukraine as intensely and as long as necessary. Why? Because it is our security that is at stake. Each time the Russian army progresses by one square kilometre, the threat gets one square kilometre closer to Europe,&quot; Barrot said. Barrot stated that Ukraine could use French-supplied long-range missiles &quot;in the logics of self defence&quot; to strike targets within Russia, but did not elaborate as to whether Kyiv has already used the French-provided weapons. During the interview Barrot also hinted France may eventually invite Ukraine to join NATO as part of Zelensky&apos;s five-point victory plan. &quot;We are open to extending an invitation, and so in our discussions with friends and allies, and friends and allies of Ukraine, we are working to get them to closer to our positions.&quot; Earlier this year, French President Emmanuel Macron said he would consider sending French troops to Ukraine in the case of a Russian breakthrough at the front or if Ukraine requested it. When asked by the BBC whether sending French troops would constitute a so-called red-line, Barrot said that France would &quot;not discard any option.&quot; Barrot&apos;s comments comes as Russia continues to intensify its attacks along the eastern front in recent weeks, putting Ukrainian forces under mounting pressure as they struggle to defend key positions. In total, almost 580,000 Russian soldiers are participating in combat against Ukraine, Vadym Skibitskyi, the deputy head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), told Interfax Ukraine on Nov. 21.	https://kyivindependent.com/west-should-not-set-red-lines-on-providing-military-support-for-ukraine-french-foreign-minister-says/	2024-11-23T11:22:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/gettyimages-2185007597-612x612.jpg
Ukraine has lost over 40% of territory previously gained in Kursk incursion, Reuters reports	Ukraine has lost over 40 per cent of the territory it previously gained in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast due to Russian counterattacks, Reuters reported on Nov. 23, citing a source in Ukraine&apos;s General Staff. &quot;At most, we controlled about 1,376 square kilometres, now of course this territory is smaller. The enemy is increasing its counterattacks,&quot; the source told Reuters. &quot;Now we control approximately 800 square kilometres. We will hold this territory for as long as is militarily appropriate.&quot; Ukraine first gained a foothold in Kursk Oblast during a surprise incursion into the Russian region in early August. Since then, Russia has launched extensive counterattacks in an effort to take back the region. NATO allies believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin is aiming to recapture territory lost in Kursk Oblast before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on Jan. 20, The Telegraph reported, hoping to gain leverage in future peace negotiations. The source added that nearly 60,000 Russian army personnel are currently stationed in Kursk Oblast, planning to reach the border with Sumy Oblast to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; there, as Ukraine looked to do with its incursion into Kursk Oblast. Kyiv has previously said that about 11,000 North Korean soldiers have joined the counteroffensive in Kursk, with the General Staff source noting that the majority of North Korean soldiers was finalizing training along Russian forces. The Kyiv Independent has not been able to verify the information provided by the General Staff source. As Russia&apos;s attempt to take back Kursk continues to progress, Russia has also intensified its attacks along the eastern front in recent weeks, putting Ukrainian forces under mounting pressure as they struggle to defend key positions. In total, almost 580,000 Russian soldiers are participating in combat against Ukraine, Vadym Skibitskyi, the deputy head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), told Interfax Ukraine on Nov. 21.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-has-lost-over-40-of-territory-previously-gained-in-russias-kursk-oblast-reuters-reports/	2024-11-23T09:48:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1258245894.jpg
Russia's Oreshnik missile likely had no explosives and didn't cause much damage, Bild analyst claims	Russia&apos;s Oreshnik missile that targeted Dnipro on Nov. 21 likely carried no explosive charge and did not cause any significate damage, German media outlet Bild reported on Nov. 23, citing Bild military analyst Julian Ropcke. The Oreshnik nuclear-capable intermediate-range ballistic missile was likely a modification of Russia&apos;s RS-26 Rubezh missile, he said. Ropcke came to this conclusion by analyzing the available footage of the strike. The RS-26 missile would not contain explosives or a warhead and would have been equipped with a substitute of the same size and weight to simulate the appearance of a nuclear warhead, according to Ropcke. &quot;This demonstrates that it was a propaganda and political action rather than a military one. There was neither a nuclear charge nor explosives inside. That&#x2019;s why the damage is so insignificant,&quot; Ropcke said. Russian President Vladimir Putin previously claimed in an address on Nov. 21 that the Oreshnik missile was a newly designed weapon and that there was &quot;no way&quot; of countering this weapon with air defense. Putin went on to say that the missile could be equipped with a nuclear warhead but that missile launched at Dnipro had been a &quot;test launch&quot; which did not include one.	https://kyivindependent.com/bild-russias-oreshnik-missile-that-targeted-dnipro-was-actually-modified-rubezh-missile/	2024-11-23T09:15:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185260447.jpg
Zaluzhnyi: Use of technological advancements will prevent 'serious' front line breakthrough until 2027	Newfound technological advancements during wartime will prevent serious front line breakthroughs along the Ukraine-Russia border until around 2027, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K., told Ukrainska Pravda in an interview published on Nov. 23. &quot;When robots began to appear massively on the battlefield, they made any movement of soldiers impossible. The inability to fight robots led to a standstill. We couldn&#x2019;t move forward towards the Russians, and the Russians, accordingly, couldn&#x2019;t move forward either,&quot; Zaluzhnyi said. Zaluzhnyi added that this was a temporary period of adaptation and, based on his predictions, by around 2027, the use of such technology could become so commonplace that the potential to achieve serious breakthroughs on the front line would resume. Russia has intensified its attacks along the eastern front in recent weeks, putting Ukrainian forces under mounting pressure as they struggle to defend key positions. Russia also continues to increase its attacks against civilian targets, amid an expected harsh winter plagued by energy shortages. On Nov. 21, in a show of force, Russia launched a new type of intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) against Dnipro. The attack comes as news that Russia has began producing thermobaric drones to target Ukraine, which are capable of causing &quot;simply terrifying&quot; hard to civilian populations, including collapsed lungs, crushed eyeballs, and brain damage, according to a source familiar with Russian drone production. Despite the onslaught of attacks and use of new weaponry, Russian troops have sustained record casualties since the start of the full-scale war and have yet to fully breach Ukrainian defenses to seize the entirety of Donetsk Oblast and continue their assault. According to estimates by Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, Russia suffered a staggering 1,420 casualties on Nov. 22. &#xA0; Despite Russia tapping about 11,000 North Korean soldiers to support its attempt to regain territory in Kursk Oblast, questions surrounding their effectiveness remains amid significant language barriers as well as a lack of active combat experience. According to Zaluzhnyi, Russia is not able to expand the front line, as it would require huge resources &quot;which the Russians no longer have.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zaluzhnyi-technological-advancements-during-wartime-prevent-serious-front-line-breakthrough-until-2027/	2024-11-23T08:43:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173728155.jpg
Media: EU parliament speaker calls for sending Taurus missiles to Ukraine	EU Parliament President Roberta Metsola is in favor of Germany sending long-range Taurus missiles to Ukraine in light of Russia&apos;s recent escalatory measures, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported on Nov. 23. &quot;Yes, that is also the position of the EU Parliament,&quot; Metsola said in an interview, as quoted by FAZ. &quot;There is broad support for this demand. We will see whether there will be a corresponding change of course after the (German) federal election.&quot; Calls for Germany to supply Ukraine with long-range Taurus missiles were renewed once the U.S. authorized Ukraine to use its ATACMS long-range missiles against targets in Russia earlier in November. A German government spokesperson told the AFP news agency on Nov. 18 that Scholz &quot;made his position clear&quot; on the matter following news from the U.S. and would &quot;not change his stance anymore.&quot; German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has repeatedly denied the possibility of supplying Ukraine with the weaponry, fearing that Germany would be brought into the war with Russia. However, Germany is set to hold elections in late February, and center-right CDU/CSU chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz has conveyed his openness to the delivery of Taurus missiles under certain conditions.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-broad-support-in-eu-parliament-for-germany-to-supply-ukraine-taurus-missiles/	2024-11-23T08:34:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1905669539.jpg
NATO Secretary General Rutte meets with Trump	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte met with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in Florida on Nov. 23, the military alliance reported. Rutte and Trump discussed a range of security issues facing NATO, according to the press release. No details were immediately available as to the specifics of the discussions. Rutte also reportedly met with U.S. Congressman Mike Waltz, who Trump picked as his national security adviser, as well as other members of Trump&apos;s incoming national security team. &#xA0;Waltz has previously expressed reservation over U.S. military aid for Ukraine, believing Europe should increase its spending. Rutte and Trump&apos;s meeting occurred against the backdrop of concerns that Trump&apos;s second term in office could see diminished support for Ukraine&apos;s war effort or even a lesser role played by the U.S. in the military alliance. In February, Trump stirred up controversy when, on the campaign trail, he said that Russia could do &quot;whatever the hell they want&quot; to NATO member countries failing to meet NATO&apos;s 2% defense spending criteria. Allies remain cautiously optimistic that Trump will continue supporting Ukraine and NATO, particularly if the efforts are framed as a demonstration of U.S. strength. During a meeting with European leaders in Budapest on Nov. 7, Rutte previously backed Trump&apos;s earlier attempts to get NATO countries to spend more on defense, beyond the current 2% of GDP target. After congratulating Trump on winning the election, Rutte wrote on Nov. 6 on X that &quot;his leadership will again be key to keeping our Alliance strong. I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through NATO.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-defense-secretary-mark-rutte-meets-with-trump/	2024-11-23T08:17:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/241123-SG-Trump_rdax_775x440s.jpg
Zelensky marks Holodomor Remembrance Day	President Volodomor Zelensky marked Holodomor Remembrance Day on Nov. 23, honoring the victims of the Soviet man-made famine that killed an estimated three to five million Ukrainians. The Holodomor occurred from 1932 to 1933 under Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin&apos;s rule. The Ukrainian government has called on the international community to recognize it as a genocide against the Ukrainian people. On Holodomor Remembrance Day, Ukrainians traditionally light a candle at 4 p.m. and place it in their window to honor the memories of those who perished in the famine. &quot;They wanted to destroy us. To kill us. To subjugate us. They failed. They wanted to hide the truth and silence the terrible crimes forever. They failed,&quot; Zelensky wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. &quot;They wanted to confuse us, mislead us, make us doubt&#x2014;to forget, and in forgetting, to forgive. They failed.&quot; Several of Ukraine&apos;s European allies also marked Holodomor Remembrance Day. European Parliament President Roberta Metsola wrote that &quot;Europe joins the people of Ukraine to remember and pay tribute (to the victims).&quot; &quot;Russia continues what it started 91 years ago &#x2013; trying to erase the Ukrainian nation from the Earth.

Bloomberg: Declassified US intelligence memorandum details Russia's suspected targeting of political adversaries abroad	A declassified U.S. intelligence memorandum sheds light on Russia&apos;s suspected assassination attempts of political adversaries abroad, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 23. The intelligence assessment, which Bloomberg obtained through the U.S.&apos;s Freedom of Information Act, details how U.S. intelligence believed in 2016 that suspected Kremlin-ordered assassinations abroad would likely persist. The document includes well-known cases, such as the murder of Alexander Litvinenko, a former FSB agent who defected to the U.K. Litvinenko accused Putin&apos;s regime of a number of crimes, including that the FSB was allegedly behind the 1999 bombings of apartment buildings in Moscow and other Russian cities that were originally blamed on Chechen rebels. Among other things, he also said Putin and his circle had ties to organized crime. Litvinenko died of radiation poisoning in 2006 and blamed Putin before his death. British intelligence concluded that Russia likely carried out the assassination, according to the U.S. intelligence memorandum. The document also lists former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko, who was poisoned on the campaign trail during the 2004 presidential election, leaving his face temporarily disfigured. It does not purport that Moscow was directly involved in his poisoning but states that his supporters believe Moscow was behind it. Yushchenko, a pro-West politician, barely survived a poising during his election campaign in which he faced pro-Russian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, backed by Putin. Following the poising, Yushchenko went on to lead the Orange Revolution, a public uprising sparked by mass election fraud that saw Yanukovych being declared the winner. Following a new round of voting Yushchenko won and became Ukraine&apos;s third president only to lose to Yanukovych in the next election. Bloomberg noted that, although the document was dated, it showed that the U.S. believed Moscow&apos;s willingness to target people abroad&#x2014;ranging from Caucasus rebels to intelligence defectors and dissidents.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-document-about-assassinations-suspected-by-russia/	2024-11-23T06:32:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185260447.jpg
Media: Polish farmers block Ukrainian border crossing	Polish farmers staged a protest in the village of Medyka on the morning of Nov. 23, blocking the road leading to the Shehyni border crossing with Ukraine, Polish media outlet RMF24 reported. Farmers are protesting the Polish government&apos;s failure to maintain the agricultural tax rate in 2024 at the same level as in 2023, according to RMF24. They are also reportedly protesting over concerns about the European Union signing a free trade agreement with South American countries in the Mercosur bloc. Only one truck per hour traveling from Poland to Ukraine will be allowed to pass, according to RMF24. Trucks coming from Ukraine are not allowed to pass, but cars, buses, vehicles with humanitarian aid, and military convoys can pass the crossing. The protest is expected to last 48 hours, but if their concerns are not met, they are reportedly ready to protest &quot;around the clock&quot; until the end of the year, RMF24 wrote. Polish farmers have staged multiple protests at border crossings between Poland and Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war, including protests against Ukrainian agricultural imports in the EU.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-polish-farmers-stage-protest-at-medyka-shehyni-border-crossing-unrelated-to-ukraine/	2024-11-23T05:20:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2025718523--1-.jpg
Ministry: Lithuania to fund production of Ukrainian long-range drones	Lithuania will fund the production of Ukrainian long-range drones, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Nov. 23. The long-term agreement between Ukraine and Lithuania includes an initial tranche of 10 million euros which has already been agreed upon and focuses particularly on Ukraine&apos;s Palianytsia missile-like drones. &quot;I expressed gratitude to the Republic of Lithuania for its steadfast support during these challenging times and personally thanked (Defense Minister Laurynas) Kasciunas for his leadership,&quot; Umerov wrote. Umerov and his Lithuanian counterpart also reportedly discussed plans to equip Ukrainian brigades, provide ammunition, strengthen air defense, and expand defense industry cooperation between the two countries as &quot;key priorities&quot; for 2025. The Defense Ministry previously announced on Nov. 22 that Sweden had also agreed to finance the production of long-range drones for Ukraine to aid the country in its defense against Russia&apos;s war of aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/ministry-lithuania-to-fund-production-of-ukrainian-long-range-drones/	2024-11-23T03:56:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/467809228_965309755417365_1519841508642714684_n.jpg
Russian forces reportedly advance near 5 settlements in Donetsk Oblast	Russian forces are reportedly advancing near five settlements in Donetsk Oblast, the crowd-sourced monitoring website Deep State reported on Nov. 23. The settlement of Velyka Novosilka was targeted directly by a military column of &quot;at least&quot; five armored fighting vehicles, as well as two others through tree lines south of the settlement of Rozdolne, according to Deep State. Ukrainian forces pushed Russian troops out of Rozdolne, but the situation in the area remains &quot;extremely challenging,&quot; Deep State reported. In addition to Velyka Novosilka and Rozdolne, Russian forces are advancing near Maksymivka, Pustynka, and Toretsk, Deep State wrote. Russia has been mounting increasingly intense attacks along multiple areas of the eastern front, attempting to breach Ukraine&apos;s defenses in Donetsk Oblast and to reach the cities of Kurakhove and Pokrovsk.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-reportedly-advance-near-5-settlements-in-donetsk-oblast/	2024-11-23T02:25:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183828650-1.jpg
Ministry: Sweden agrees to finance production of long-range drones for Ukraine	Sweden has agreed to finance the production of Ukrainian long-range drones, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry reported on Nov. 22. The announcement came during Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov&apos;s working visit in Sweden and his talks with his Swedish counterpart Pal Jonson. The defense ministers also discussed plans for military aid to Ukraine in 2025, including efforts to equip military units with hardware, which Umerov said are in the &#x201C;final stages&#x201D; of negotiation. &#x201C;For us, this is not just about partnership but also about shared security,&#x201D; Umerov said, as quoted by the Defense Ministry. According to the Defense Ministry, Umerov also met with representatives of Swedish defense companies. Sweden announced a new aid package for Ukraine worth 9 million euros ($9.8 million) in early November, which included two vessels designed to enhance maritime security.	https://kyivindependent.com/defense-ministry-sweden-agrees-to-finance-production-of-long-range-drones/	2024-11-23T00:57:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/1_467842476_3de048d004.webp
General Staff: Russia has lost 729,720 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 729,720 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Nov. 23. This number includes 1,420 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,419 tanks, 19,192 armored fighting vehicles, 29,850 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,760 artillery systems, 1,254 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,004 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 19,365 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-729-720-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-11-22T23:10:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2003914665.jpg
Republican senator, Trump ally rejects idea of negotiating with Putin	U.S. Senator Mike Rounds, a Republican and ally of President-elect Donald Trump, said on Nov. 22 that Russia could not be trusted to engage in peace negotiations to end the full-scale war in Ukraine. &#xA0; &quot;As much as I would like to believe we can negotiate with a tyrant, I suspect we may be deceiving ourselves,&quot; Rounds said at the Halifax Security Forum, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Rounds&apos; remarks stand in stark contrast to the views expressed by Trump, who has repeatedly pressed for a swift deal to end the war. Trump has also spoken admiringly of Putin on a number of occasions. &quot;Do you believe that this tyrant, if you offer him a part of a free country, do you think he&apos;s gonna stop?&quot; Rounds said, as reported by Politico. &quot;I wish I could say there&#x2019;s an easy way out, there&apos;s not.&quot; While many of Trump&apos;s congressional allies have opposed ongoing military aid to Ukraine, Senate Republicans are generally pro-Ukraine and skeptical of negotiating with Moscow. Rounds went so far as to express frustration that the U.S. has not provided more weapons to Kyiv. &quot;I just feel so frustrated that we have not been able to provide them all of the equipment that they need, and all of the weapons systems that they need, in order to respond to the absolute tyranny coming from Russia,&quot; he said. &quot;I wonder why we haven&apos;t done more more quickly than we have.&quot; Rounds did not criticize Trump directly and pointed out that his views were not those of the incoming presidential administration. Trump takes office on Jan. 20, 2025. His push for speedy negotiations has sparked fears that Washington will pressure Kyiv to accept a deal that favors Moscow, including territorial concessions and a possible promise not to join NATO.	https://kyivindependent.com/republican-senator-trump-ally-rejects-idea-of-negotiating-with-putin/	2024-11-22T21:48:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1850051282.jpg
Whoever enters parliament enters Russia,' Georgian president says	Entering the Georgian parliament following the widely disputed results of Tbilisi&apos;s October parliamentary elections is the same as entering Russia, Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili said during an interview with local television on Nov. 22. &quot;Whoever enters the parliament today will enter Russia,&quot; she told the Georgian broadcaster Mtavari Arkhi. Zourabichvili has accused the ruling pro-Russian Georgian Dream party of rigging the recent elections and refused to accept the stated results. Along with other opposition party leaders, she has called for public demonstrations and a parliamentary boycott. &quot;I am sure that the parties will not enter the parliament,&quot; she said. According to Zourabichvili, the 2024 elections were defined by fraud on an unprecedented scale. &quot;There was, as always, what I call &apos;normal rigging,&apos; and they make fun of me for it, but the feeling that the elections and the country were stolen from us did not exist,&quot; she said. &quot;The situation is very different. Today, whoever enters the parliament will enter Russia.&quot; Official results of the October election show Georgian Dream securing nearly 54% of the vote, but pro-EU opposition leaders and international observers have highlighted widespread allegations of intimidation, ballot-stuffing, and vote-buying. The disputed results triggered large-scale protests in Tbilisi. Police began dispersing and arresting demonstrators on Nov. 18, though organizers promised to continue protesting. Zourabichvili also insists that if Georgian Dream continues to stand by the allegedly fraudulent election results, they will govern alone. &quot;They are alone,&quot; she said. &quot;They are alone in the parliament, they are alone in the government. The government, the parliament, is one-party, under the vertical of one person, and all the institutions that exist in the country are completely dependent on this one party.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/whoever-enters-parliament-enters-russia-georgian-president-says/	2024-11-22T21:13:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175488096-1.jpg
Crimean Tatar editor goes missing in occupied Crimea	Ediye Muslimova, the editor-in-chief of a Crimean Tatar children&apos;s magazine, disappeared in Russian-occupied Crimea on Nov. 21, according to the NGO Crimean Solidarity. Lutfiye Zudiyeva, a journalist and human rights activist, said Muslimova was seen being put into a white GAZelle vehicle by three unknown men near her home the morning of Nov. 21. Crimea has been under Russian occupation since 2014. Following Moscow&apos;s illegal annexation, Russia began targeting the peninsula&apos;s indigenous Tatar population, which has been particularly vocal in resisting the occupation. Muslimova&apos;s family became concerned after Muslimova, 61, would not answer or return calls, according to her niece, Elzara. &quot;I started calling &#x2014; she has two phones (a work phone and her regular phone), both phones are turned off,&quot; Elzara Muslimova said. &quot;There is no connection: no Telegram, no WhatsApp, no Viber.&quot; Zudiyeva&apos;s account of an apparent abduction was supported by Zarema Bariieva, manager of the Crimean Tatar Resource Center (CTRC). &quot;Recently, it became known that a 61-year-old woman is being held in the FSB (Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service) building,&quot; she said in a Facebook post. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these reports at the time of publication. Muslimova is the daughter of Crimean Tatar activitst Refat Muslimov and editor of the children&apos;s magazine &quot;Armanchyk,&quot; which has been published monthly since 2011. It is reportedly the only glossy children&apos;s magazine in the Crimean Tatar language. According to the CTRC, 70% of all political prisoners in occupied Crimea are Crimean Tatars.	https://kyivindependent.com/crimean-tatar-editor-goes-missing-in-occupied-crimea/	2024-11-22T19:50:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/armanchyk.jpeg
NASAMS air defense systems delivered to Ukraine, Canadian defense minister says	A promised shipment of air defense systems purchased with the assistance of the Canadian government has reached Ukraine, Canada&apos;s Defense Minister Bill Blair announced on Nov. 22. The U.S.-made National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) were first pledged to Kyiv back in January 2023. While Canada reportedly paid for the system, worth approximately $289 million, later in the spring, its delivery has been delayed. Blair said the NASAMS are now in Ukrainian hands. &quot;This ground-based air defense system will help Ukraine protect itself against destructive air attacks,&quot; Blair said. &quot;Canada&apos;s support for Ukraine is steadfast and we will continue to step up and build on our contributions to Ukraine in their fight against Russia&apos;s invasion.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky previously said on Nov. 4 that Ukraine expected to receive the defense system &quot;by the end of this year.&quot; The NASAMS delivery arrives as Ukraine faces intensified Russian aerial attacks, including the recently deployed &quot;Oreshnik&quot; intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), launched against Dnipro on Nov. 21. Following the strike on Dnipro, Zelensky reiterated the importance of advanced Western air defense systems, directing Defense Minister Rustem Umerov to begin new talks with partners on acquiring additional equipment. Ukrainian forces have been using NASAMS systems since November 2022, when the U.S. delivered the first batteries amid escalating Russian airstrikes.	https://kyivindependent.com/nasams-air-defense-systems-delivered-to-ukraine-canadian-defense-minister-says/	2024-11-22T18:54:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2002538371.jpg
Trump may name former intelligence director Richard Grenell as Ukraine peace envoy, Reuters reports	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is considering naming his former intelligence director, diplomat Richard Grenell, as a special Ukrainian peace envoy to lead negotiations on an end to Russia&apos;s war, Reuters reported on Nov. 22. Fox News previously reported on Nov. 13 that Trump planned to announce a special envoy to take the lead on peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv. Throughout his campaign, Trump insisted he would negotiate a swift end to Russia&apos;s all-out war in Ukraine if reelected. Grenell is a contender for the new position, four sources close to Trump&apos;s transition plans told Reuters. Grenell served as U.S. Ambassador to Germany during Trump&apos;s first presidential term and &#xA0;as acting National Intelligence Director for a period in 2020. He was also appointed Special Presidential Envoy for Serbia and Kosovo Peace Negotiations from 2019-2021. In July, Grenell told Bloomberg that a path to peace in Ukraine could include the creation of &quot;autonomous zones,&quot; though he did not explain what this would entail. &quot;Autonomous regions can mean a lot of things to a lot of people, but you got to work through those details,&quot; he said. Grenell also said he did not think Ukraine should become a member of NATO in the near future. The sources who spoke to Bloomberg said it was still possible Trump could change his mind about establishing the Ukraine envoy position.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-may-name-former-intelligence-director-richard-grenell-as-ukraine-peace-envoy-reuters-reports/	2024-11-22T17:58:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2162458237.jpg
Lukashenko threatens internet blackout during 2025 elections to prevent protests	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has stated that he may completely shut down the internet during the 2025 presidential elections if protests similar to those in 2020 arise, state-run news outlet Belta reported on Nov. 22. &quot;If this [the protests] happens again, we will shut the internet down completely,&quot; Lukashenko said, admitting that internet shutdowns during the 2020 protests were carried out with his approval. Speaking at Minsk State Linguistic University, he justified the 2020 internet blackout by claiming it was necessary to protect the country&#x2019;s stability, as protests were allegedly organized online, particularly from abroad. Lukashenko also denied allegations of violence against demonstrators, asserting, &quot;No one was holding down or beating anyone,&quot; despite widespread reports of police brutality during the 2020 protests. Lukashenko, the country&apos;s leader since 1994 and Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s closest ally, has long been accused of staging fraudulent elections in Belarus. In 2020, during the last presidential election, Lukashenko maintained power despite the country&apos;s most prominent opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, receiving popular support &#x2014; claiming she won with 60 percent of the vote. Following the fabricated results, mass protest erupted in Minsk but were ultimately quelled with the support of Russia. According to the Belarusian human rights group Viasna, over 50,000 citizens have been detained for political reasons since the 2020 election. His remarks come as Belarus approaches its next presidential election, amid ongoing international scrutiny of his 30-year rule and the repression of dissent.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-threatens-internet-blackout-during-2025-elections-to-prevent-protests/	2024-11-22T16:29:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2162854097.jpg
Ukraine begins talks with partners about advanced air defense systems, following Russia's ICBM strike	President Volodymyr Zelensky has directed Defense Minister Rustem Umerov to engage with partners on acquiring advanced air defense systems, according to Zelensky&#x2019;s statement on Nov. 22. This initiative is in response to Russia launching a new type of intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) called &#x201C;Oreshnik&#x201D; against Dnipro, east Ukraine, on the morning of Nov. 21. The attack came in the wake of what appeared to be Ukraine&apos;s first successful strike of a military target inside Russia using the U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles. The IRBM missiles are only guided during the initial stages of launch, so they can be less accurate than cruise missiles, but have the advantage of reaching incredibly high speeds &#x2014; sometimes more than 3,200 kilometers per hour &#x2014; as they approach their targets. &quot;The Minister of Defense of Ukraine is already holding meetings with our partners regarding new air defense systems&#x2014;precisely such systems that are capable of protecting lives from new risks,&quot; Zelensky said on Telegram. He emphasized that Russia&apos;s testing of experimental missiles constitutes an international crime and criticized Moscow for escalating aggression despite global calls for peace. Zelensky promised to share details about the missile attack on Dnipro with international media, so that the full extent is known to global audiences.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-begins-talks-with-partners-about-advanced-air-defense-systems-following-russias-icbm-strike/	2024-11-22T14:14:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/Fwg-DGnWIAkfPD2.jpg
Hungary criticizes US sanctions on Gazprombank as 'threat to energy security', Bloomberg reports	Hungary criticized U.S. sanctions on Gazprombank, stating that they pose a threat to the energy security of Central European countries, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 22. The move is an &#x201C;attack on our sovereignty,&#x201D; Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said, speaking at the Istanbul Energy Forum. &#x201C;Hungary is grateful to Turkey, Bulgaria, and Serbia for ensuring a very safe, very reliable, and very stable transit.&#x201D; Along with Slovakia and Austria, Hungary remains reliant on Russian gas, paid for through the now-sanctioned Gazprombank. Hungary receives roughly 4.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas on an annual basis under a 15-year deal signed in 2021. Gazprom and Hungary&apos;s MVM energy company signed a memorandum of understanding on increasing gas supplies at a forum in St. Petersburg on Oct. 10. Budapest is broadly seen as the most Moscow-friendly country within the EU and NATO, repeatedly obstructing aid to Kyiv and sanctions against Russia. Szijjarto has also repeatedly visited Russia throughout the full-scale war, a step that his European colleagues avoided.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-criticizes-us-sanctions-on-gazprombank-as-threat-to-energy-security-bloomberg-reports/	2024-11-22T13:22:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/upd_GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
What is Russia's Oreshnik missile, and what happens next?	Russian President Vladimir Putin on Nov. 21 announced his country had launched a new type of missile in an attack on Ukraine, a demonstration of military might meant to deter Kyiv&apos;s allies from further support against his full-scale invasion. &quot;There are currently no ways of countering this weapon. The missiles attack targets at a speed of 10 Mach, that&apos;s 2.5-3 km per second,&quot; he said. &quot;We are ready for any developments. If anyone still doubts this, they shouldn&apos;t. There will always be a response.&quot; Putin said the &quot;new missile&quot; was called &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; but analysts and officials have since questioned the novelty of the weapon, as well as how effective it could be to prevent allies&apos; support of Ukraine. According to Putin, Oreshnik, which means &quot;hazel&quot; in English, is a new invention that Western air defense systems would not be able to intercept. The Oreshnik is designed to carry nuclear weapons. However, Putin said it was not armed with a nuclear warhead during this attack. &quot;In combat conditions, a test was carried out of one of the latest Russian intermediate-range missile systems. In this case, with a non-nuclear hypersonic version of a ballistic missile,&quot; he said in a live speech on Nov. 21. The Oreshnik described by Putin is so new that barely anything is known about it other than what he claimed during his speech. The reality however, appears to be slightly different. &quot;I&apos;d be extremely shocked if this missile system had more than 10% new parts,&quot; Fabian Hoffmann, a defense expert and doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;I think basically they just took apart the RS-26 or just cannibalized it, and then put together this new missile with a couple of upgrades, and a new paint job.&quot; The RS-26 Hoffman refers to is the RS-26 Rubezh, of which quite a bit is known. First produced in 2011, and successfully tested in 2012, the Rubezh is a 36,000 kilogram, nuclear capable, intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) with a known range of 5,800 kilometers. Its declared but undemonstrated range of 6,000 kilometers would only just nudge it into the category of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Its development and deployment was actually halted in 2018 in favor of the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle. The Rubezh is equipped with a MIRV payload, which stands for Multiple Independent Reentry Vehicles, which can be seen in videos of the attack on Dnipro. Footage shows multiple projectiles hitting the ground, but without the large explosions normally associated with conventional missiles or payloads, suggesting it was carrying essentially a dummy warhead. On Nov. 22, HUR provided further details of Oreshnik, claiming it is actually just a different name for a previously known missile called &quot;Kedr,&quot; translated as &quot;cedar,&quot; which Russia tested in October 2023 and June 2024. The missile that struck Dnipro was equipped with six warheads, each containing six submunitions, and reached speeds exceeding Mach 11 (around 13,500 kilometers per hour) as it descended, HUR added. &quot;I think it&apos;s really important that we don&apos;t overreact,&quot; Hoffman said, adding the missile itself isn&apos;t anything particularly new despite what Putin said on Nov. 21. &quot;I like his &apos;hypersonic&apos; comment &#x2014; of course he had to put that in, but every medium-range ballistic missile will reach hypersonic velocity at one point, so this is just nothing,&quot; he adds. A U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity echoed the sentiment, telling the Kyiv Independent that while &quot;we take all threats against Ukraine seriously, it is important to keep a few key facts in mind.&quot; &quot;Ukraine has withstood countless attacks from Russia, including from missiles with significantly larger warheads than this weapon. &quot;Let me be clear: Russia may be seeking to use this capability to try to intimidate Ukraine and its supporters, or generate attention in the information space, but it will not be a game changer in this conflict.&quot; What is potentially new is the global geopolitical situation, the level of tension, and the threats of escalation. The deployment of the missile came shortly after Russia adopted changes to its nuclear deterrence doctrine, which lowered the threshold for a nuclear response. The Kremlin was very clear that the doctrine changes were a signal to the West. &quot;While the doctrine serves as a signal to decision-makers and national security apparatuses, the missile strike is aimed at the general public,&quot; says Matej Kandr&#xED;k, the executive director at the Adapt Institute. Russia has deployed nuclear-capable missiles in Ukraine before, but Oreshnik&apos;s features, like its MRV (multiple reentry vehicle) capability, &quot;invoke the scary, apocalyptic image of nuclear war and therefore allow our imaginations to do a lot of the work for Putin,&quot; Jenny Mathers, senior lecturer in international politics at Aberystwyth University, told the Kyiv Independent. Russia has been employing covert or overt nuclear threats to deter international support for Ukraine since day one of the full-scale invasion. The Kremlin&apos;s &quot;red lines&quot; failed to influence the West from supplying tanks, fighter jets, and long-range missiles. Putin is now attempting to demonstrate strength after U.S. and British missiles struck targets on Russian sovereign territory. &quot;Putin&apos;s problem is that he is running out of ways to convey this message, given all the times that he and other senior Russian officials have warned against certain courses of action&#x2026; and hinted at dire consequences but then confined their escalation of the war to increasingly brutal attacks on Ukraine&apos;s civilian population and infrastructure,&quot; Mathers said. According to Kandrik, Putin&apos;s &quot;ideal outcome would be a prohibition on the use of U.S.-provided deep-strike weapons within its territory and restrictions on future deliveries of such systems.&quot; Mathers also sees it as an attempt to deter broader Western support for Ukraine. Western officials denounced the IRBM launch as an escalation but also made clear that it would not deter their support for Ukraine. &quot;Deploying this capability will neither change the course of the conflict nor deter NATO allies from supporting Ukraine,&quot; NATO spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah said. The calculus may change after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January, as his team is likely to seek a quick settlement to &quot;get out&quot; of the conflict. It remains unclear whether the incoming president, who has often criticized military aid for Ukraine, will keep the long-range strikes policy in place if it could spark further escalatory moves by Russia. &quot;Putin knows that the clock is ticking for both Russia and Ukraine as we get closer to Jan. 20 and Donald Trump&apos;s return to the U.S. presidency,&quot; Mathers said. &quot;Therefore, what Putin needs is to convey the impression that Russia is in a commanding position and can continue to fight for as long as it needs to in order to achieve victory.&quot; Experts say, however, that Oreshnik&apos;s launch is not the start of an escalation chain leading to a nuclear apocalypse. &quot;Let&apos;s keep a cool head&#x2026; . We have a mechanism in place. It&apos;s called an escalation ladder with a lot of steps to go through between nuclear saber-rattling or nuclear messaging, which is what&apos;s happening now, and the nuclear first use of preemptive strike,&quot; Mathieu Boul&#xE8;gue, a senior fellow at the CEPA think tank, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The Russian leadership is not suicidal. The moment they start going a bit too far in nuclear escalation&#x2026; this will be the end for the Russian regime.&quot; Federico Borsari, a resident fellow at CEPA, pointed out that Russia warned the U.S. about the missile&apos;s use in advance and that Iskander and Kinzhal missiles that Russia regularly uses in Ukraine can carry a nuclear warhead as well. Oreshnik&apos;s use &quot;is clearly a political message,&quot; but not one indicating a nuclear escalation, he concludes.	https://kyivindependent.com/what-is-russias-oreshnik-missile-and-what-happens-next/	2024-11-22T12:13:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2006245916.jpg
Russian military shoot 5 Ukrainian POWs near Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast	Russian troops shot dead five captured Ukrainian Armed Forces soldiers near Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast in early October, the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor&apos;s Office said on Nov. 22. The killing of prisoners of war (POWs) is a violation of the Geneva Conventions and is classified as a serious international crime. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has launched an investigation into the killing of Ukrainian soldiers near Vuhledar, from which Ukrainian forces withdrew on Oct. 2. Investigators believe the soldiers were shot dead on the day the Ukrainian army retreated as Russian troops stormed their positions, according to the statement. During one of the attacks, the Russian military captured five unarmed Ukrainian servicemen. &quot;They (the Russian military) killed one of them in a forest belt and took four of them to the road at gunpoint, where they also shot them dead,&quot; the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor&apos;s Office said. The regional prosecutor&apos;s office earlier reported that in a separate incident the Russian military had shot dead two Ukrainian POWs in Donetsk Oblast&apos;s Pokrovsk district in mid-November. They were stripped naked and shot dead, according to the prosecutors. In a picture published by the prosecutors, two blurred naked bodies are seen lying on the ground. Law enforcement officers are currently investigating 53 criminal proceedings over the executions of 177 Ukrainian soldiers, while 37 proceedings of 109 executions were registered in 2024 alone, according to the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-military-shoot-5-ukrainian-pows-near-vuhledar-in-donetsk-oblast/	2024-11-22T11:59:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-22-21_48_07.jpeg
Ukraine war latest: Russia likely used ballistic missile from 'Kedr' complex to strike Dnipro, intelligence says	Key developments on Nov. 22: The ballistic missile launched by Russia on Nov. 21 against the city of Dnipro was likely part of the &quot;Kedr&quot; missile complex tested in recent years, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. Several companies part of the Russian military-industrial complex were involved in developing &quot;Kedr,&quot; which was tested at the Kapustin Yar test site in 2023 and 2024, HUR said on Nov. 22. HUR&apos;s statement comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin said in his televised address to the nation on Nov. 21 that the attack was a test of Russia&apos;s &quot;newest missile,&quot; an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) called &quot;Oreshnik.&quot; The missile was launched at Dnipro from Russia&apos;s Astrakhan Oblast and covered nearly 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) in 15 minutes, according to HUR. The missile was equipped with six warheads, each carrying six submunitions. The speed on the final section of the missile&apos;s trajectory was over Mach (&#x41C;) 11. At a temperature of 15&#xB0;C (59&#xB0;F), the speed of 1 M in the atmosphere is 1,225 kilometers per hour (716 miles per hour). &quot;It is an experimental system. Let&apos;s just say it&apos;s a medium-range ballistic missile. It is a carrier of nuclear weapons. The fact that they used it in a non-nuclear version is, as they (Russians) say, a warning from them that they have not gone completely crazy,&quot; military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said at an event on Nov. 22. Budanov called Russia&apos;s latest development &quot;a prototype,&quot; adding that it is not currently in mass production. Russian media circulated information about the development of a missile system called &quot;Kedr&quot; in 2021, labeling it &quot;a new-generation strategic complex.&quot; Initial reports by Ukrainian authorities suggested that Russia had test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile to target Dnipro. Later that evening, Putin said the new &quot;Oreshnik&quot; IRBM had allegedly been used. Little is known about the &quot;Oreshnik&quot; missile referred to by Putin, but military expert Yan Matveev told Russian independent media outlet IStories that it could be a modified version of the &quot;Rubezh&quot; IRBM. The RS-26 &quot;Rubezh&quot; is reported to have a range of up to 6,000 kilometers and can carry four warheads, each with an estimated payload of 0.3 megatons. Russia aims to launch the &quot;Oreshnik&quot; intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) into mass production, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Nov. 22 during a meeting with the representatives of the Russian Defense Ministry and the national military-industrial complex. Putin denied that the Oreshnik is a modernization of old Soviet systems, as the missile is allegedly based on &quot;the latest Russian developments.&quot; The Russian president added that there are no analogs of such weapons in the world, nor are there any means to intercept them. &quot;Given its striking power, especially in mass use, and combined with other high-precision long-range systems Russia also has, its use against enemy targets will be comparable to strategic weapons. Although the system is not a strategic weapon,&quot; Putin claimed. Russian forces still have a stockpile of these missile systems ready for use, according to Putin. The Russian president also said that Russia will continue to test the Oreshnik missile, including in combat conditions. Putin added that Russia is working on a series of medium- and short-range missiles. Several Russian systems are allegedly being tested and planned for mass production. Russia gave North Korea oil and anti-aircraft missiles in return for military support in Ukraine, according to a South Korean official, and satellite imagery analysis. North Korea has dispatched 10,000 troops to Russia, with most of them deployed in Kursk Oblast and taking part in combat, a Pentagon spokesperson said during a press briefing on Nov. 12. South Korea&apos;s national security advisor Shin Won-sik on Nov. 22 said Moscow had provided Pyongyang with economic and military technology in exchange for the troops. &quot;It is understood that North Korea has been provided with related equipment and anti-aircraft missiles to strengthen Pyongyang&apos;s weak air defense system,&quot; Shin said in an interview with South Korea&apos;s SBS News. Elsewhere, the BBC on Nov. 22 reported that Russia is estimated to have supplied North Korea with more than a million barrels of oil since March this year, a breach of international sanctions. Pyongyang is subject to a strict cap on oil transfers, imposed by the U.N. Security Council in 2017 after a series of nuclear weapons tests. The claim was based on an analysis of satellite imagery by the Open Source Center, a non-profit research group based in the U.K. U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy told the BBC that the oil is payment for weapons and troops sent to Moscow to fuel the war in Ukraine. North Korean leader Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a strategic partnership agreement in June. Under the treaty, the two countries pledge to help each other if either is attacked. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui visited Moscow and met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Nov. 4. &quot;Our country will stand firmly by our Russian comrades until the day of victory,&quot; Choe said, calling Moscow&apos;s offensive against Ukraine a &quot;sacred struggle.&quot; Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K., claimed that the direct involvement of Russia&apos;s allies, such as North Korea, in the war against Ukraine was evidence of a global conflict. Nearly 60,000 Russian army personnel are currently stationed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Suspilne reported on Nov. 22, citing its undisclosed source in the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. Earlier reports from Ukrainian authorities said Russia had amassed 50,000 troops in Kursk Oblast, including North Korean soldiers, to attempt to push the Ukrainian military out of its territory. Ukrainian forces will remain in Kursk Oblast as long as &quot;militarily possible,&quot; the source said. According to the source, the General Staff believes that the Russian troops are planning to reach the border with Sumy Oblast to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; there, as Ukraine looked to do with its incursion into Kursk Oblast. Kyiv launched the surprise offensive into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6. Russian forces have managed to reclaim around half of the territory initially captured by Ukrainian troops. Russia has also deployed thousands of North Korean troops in the embattled region, with some reportedly already clashing with Ukraine in small-scale battles. Around 11,000 North Korean soldiers were stationed in Kursk Oblast as of Nov. 4. According to Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, Russian forces have suffered 7,905 soldiers killed, 12,220 injured, and 717 captured during the three months of the Kursk offensive. The war in Ukraine has reached a &quot;decisive phase,&quot; and the latest events demonstrate the real threat of a &quot;global conflict,&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Nov. 22. Tusk&apos;s comments came in the wake of Russia&apos;s attack on Dnipro a day earlier, in which Moscow claims a new missile, an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) called &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; was tested. Speaking at the Congress of the Polish Teachers&apos; Union, Tusk referred to what he called &quot;the events of the last dozen hours&quot; as demonstrating there is a &quot;serious and real threat of global conflict.&quot; &quot;It would be hard for me not to say a few fundamental words today about the situation, because it is historic,&quot; he said in comments reported by Polish outlet Radio Zet. &quot;The war in the east is entering its decisive phase. We all know it. We feel that the unknown is approaching. None of us knows the end of this conflict, but we know that it is currently taking on very dramatic dimensions.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin on Nov. 21 said his country had launched its &quot;newest missile&quot; in the attack on Dnipro, eastern Ukraine that morning. He said the test was in response to Ukraine targeting facilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk and Bryansk oblasts with long-range, Western-supplied ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles on Nov. 19 and 20. The Oreshnik missile is designed to carry nuclear weapons. However, Putin said it was not armed with a nuclear warhead in this instance. Poland, one of Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters, is being pressured by Russia over the new U.S. missile defense base that opened in northern Poland on Nov. 13, as reported by Reuters. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski also announced on Nov. 19 that key EU countries are ready to increase military and financial aid to Ukraine if the U.S. reduces its support.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-likely-used-ballistic-missile-from-kedr-complex-to-strike-dnipro-intelligence-says/	2024-11-22T11:23:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2151313411.jpg
Russia plans to launch mass production of Oreshnik missile, Putin says	Russia aims to launch the &quot;Oreshnik&quot; intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) into mass production, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Nov. 22 during a meeting with the representatives of the Russian Defense Ministry and the national military-industrial complex. A day prior, Putin said in an evening address that Russian forces had used the &quot;Oreshnik&quot; to attack the city of Dnipro in Ukraine&apos;s Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Ukrainian authorities have not yet provided an official report on Russia&apos;s weapon used in the recent attack. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) suggested that this was not a new Russian design but part of Russia&apos;s Kedr missile complex that has been in development since at least 2021. Putin denied that the Oreshnik is a modernization of old Soviet systems, as the missile is allegedly based on &quot;the latest Russian developments.&quot; The Russian president added that there are no analogs of such weapons in the world, nor are there any means to intercept them. &quot;Given its striking power, especially in mass use, and combined with other high-precision long-range systems Russia also has, its use against enemy targets will be comparable to strategic weapons.

It was my first revolution' — Ukrainians look back on the Orange Revolution 20 years later	Two weeks before Ukraine&apos;s pivotal 2004 presidential election, 22-year-old filmmaker Iryna Tsilyk found herself at the center of a heated exchange during a trip to Moscow. The upcoming elections were a topic of group conversation and one Russian woman, bristling with anger, demanded, &#x201C;How dare you Ukrainians think you are independent?&#x201D; &#x201C;It was the first time in my life that I realized how much some Russians really hate the idea that we Ukrainians live in an independent country,&#x201D; Tsilyk told the Kyiv Independent. That animosity toward Ukrainian sovereignty would later come to manifest itself in the election results. Pro-Russian candidate Viktor Yanukovych was declared the winner over the pro-Western reformer Viktor Yushchenko in the Nov. 21, 2004 runoff, following widespread documented voter intimidation and electoral fraud. Outraged by the stolen election, Tsilyk and hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians poured into the streets of Kyiv on the day after the election, demanding justice and a return to democratic principles. The Orange Revolution &#x2014; a two-month wave of peaceful protests, strikes, and sit-ins centered in Kyiv &#x2014; ultimately forced a new vote. Yushchenko triumphed, signaling a victory for Ukraine&#x2019;s democratic aspirations. &#x201C;It was a turning point when Ukrainians, myself included, understood that if we are united, we have the power to bring about positive change in our country,&#x201D; Tsilyk said. Twenty years after the Orange Revolution, as Ukrainians continue to resist Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war of aggression, many are looking back on the anniversary of that uprising as the first battle in their enduring fight for the nation&#x2019;s independence. The 2004 presidential election that sparked the Orange Revolution was perhaps the most heated election in Ukraine&#x2019;s recent history. Sitting President Leonid Kuchma, whose time in office had been overshadowed by a high level of corruption and events like the brutal murder of journalist Georgiy Gongadze, threw his support behind Yanukovych&#x2019;s candidacy as a continuation of the status quo. A wave of televised political smear campaigns attempting to portray Yushchenko as a fascist, coupled with his shocking poisoning in September 2004, defined the fraught lead-up to the initial vote. For many Ukrainians, all this underscored the high stakes of the election. Six weeks before the election, Yanukovych updated his campaign platform to include proposals for dual citizenship, elevating Russian to the status of a second state language, and rejecting NATO membership. On top of that, Russian leader Vladimir Putin arrived in Kyiv under the pretense of celebrating the anniversary of Ukraine&#x2019;s Soviet liberation from the Nazis on Oct. 28, but it soon became clear that he had other intentions, as he made a return visit leading up to the runoff vote. People shout during a celebration at Maidan Nezalezhnosti Square (Independence Square) as Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko, the 50-year-old hero of the &quot;Orange Revolution,&quot; arrives there after an inaugural ceremony in the Parliament in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Jan. 23 , 2005. (Yuri Kadobnov /AFP via Getty Images)Supporters of opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko in Kyiv, Ukraine on Dec. 3, 2004. (Sergei Supinsky / AFP via Getty Images)Appearing on Ukrainian national television, Putin tried to make it appear that he had no preferred candidate. He talked about how much he liked the Ukrainian language, poorly recited lines from 19th century national poet Taras Shevchenko&#x2019;s pivotal work &#x201C;Kobzar,&#x201D; and told Ukrainians to &#x201C;vote for the candidate they liked.&#x201D; But it was clear that Moscow favored Yanukovych as the next president of Ukraine, and the Yuschenko campaign publicly accused Putin of foreign election interference. In Kharkiv, Ukraine&#x2019;s second-largest city, English teacher and interpreter Hennadii Tsupin recalled seeing people putting up posters with Yuschenko sporting a Hitler mustache as well as posters of Ukraine divided between East and West. &#x201C;We could also see that the nomenklatura &#x2014; employees of the state &#x2014; were ordered to support Yanukovych. Teachers and doctors, because they are paid by the state budget, were forced to attend meetings in support of Yanukovych. Workers of the state-owned enterprises, too,&#x201D; Tsupin said. When Yuschenko had come earlier in 2004 to visit Kharkiv with the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, some pro-Yanukovych agitators were waving the Russian flag and shouting angrily at Yuschenko supporters. The police had to separate them, and there was &#x201C;a lot of passion and anger in the air.&#x201D; Tsupin didn&apos;t consider himself an active participant in the Orange Revolution when it started, as he remained in Kharkiv, but he did his part to be an informed citizen during the election. He tied an orange ribbon to his Lada, the color of Yuschenko&#x2019;s campaign. He also went to Yuschenko&#x2019;s campaign headquarters and got some campaign stickers to distribute around the city. &#x201C;Because I am 1.90 meters (6 foot 2) I could stick them quite high up on metal posts, out of reach of Yushchenko haters,&#x201D; he recalled. When Yanukovych garnered 39.3% of the vote and Yushchenko 39.8%, the run-off vote was triggered, as presidential candidates needed to secure more than 50% of the vote to win. Journalist Olga Tokariuk was a 19-year-old university student in Kyiv during the 2004 election when she and three of her friends volunteered to work as election observers on behalf of Yuschenko&#x2019;s campaign during the Nov. 21 runoff vote. When asked where they would prefer to serve, their answer was simple: &quot;Anywhere.&quot; They were sent to Luhansk Oblast, having been told that &quot;nobody wanted to go there.&quot; The group arrived in Stanytsia Luhanska, a town that is under Russian occupation today. Tokariuk recalled how local residents were kind toward the outsiders and engaged in conversation with them in Ukrainian. At the polling station, Tokariuk witnessed firsthand how pro-Yanukovych people were trying to stuff the ballots. Election observers in support of Yanukovych&#x2019;s campaign also forced out pro-Yushchenko observers across numerous polling stations, Tokariuk among them, so they couldn&#x2019;t register any violations. &#x201C;It was really shocking how well-coordinated it all was,&#x201D; she told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Almost all of our observers were expelled.&#x201D; &#x201C;Some of them were even taken to the forests with a sack put over their heads, intimidated, threatened with automatic weapons. Those elections were absolutely not free and transparent. We saw it with our own eyes.&#x201D; Returning from Luhasnk to Kyiv after observing the election fraud and voter intimidation in the runoff, Tokariuk and other election observers discussed their concerns over the experience. Exit polls suggested that Yuschenko had secured 52% of the run-off vote and Yanukovych only 43%, but the next morning, the Central Election Commission declared Yanukovych the winner by 2.5%. &#x201C;We decided that we had to do something,&#x201D; Tokariuk said. &#x201C;We soon learned that a lot of people had the same idea.&#x201D; An estimated 500,000 people gathered in central Kyiv in the days following the election results, many coming from cities across Ukraine to take part in the Orange Revolution. &quot;On the first day after the victory was declared for Yanukovych, I knew that I had to be there,&#x201D; said Khrystia Vengryniuk, who was a 17-year-old university student in the western city of Chernivtsi. Like many of her fellow Ukrainians, she understood that the election results had been rigged. &quot;I told my classmates that all of us needed to be there, not in class, because our future depended on it,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;There were a few other like-minded students in my group, and we stood on the central square in Chernivtsi. Later, we traveled to Kyiv to join (other protesters on) the Maidan.&quot; Vengryniuk had only brought her autumn coat with her to Kyiv but she was determined to stand on the central square day and night despite the cold. &#x201C;I had to fight for what I believed in,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;It felt like everything in Ukraine would finally be okay, that we were breaking away from Russia for good.&#x201D; Tsilyk and her friends also took part in the Orange Revolution from the very first days. &#x201C;We got creative coordinating orange in our outfits,&#x201D; Tsilyk said, referring to the color of Yushchenko&#x2019;s campaign that later came to symbolize the revolution. The streets of Kyiv were a sea of orange. &#x201C;The entire atmosphere was vibrant and festive &#x2014; people were singing and chanting pro-Yushchenko slogans.&#x201D; Supporters of opposition presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko surround the parliament building in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Nov. 27, 2004. (Uriel Sinai/Getty Images)Despite the frigid weather and the high stakes of the protests, many Ukrainians remember the Orange Revolution as a largely peaceful, even celebratory moment. In stark contrast to the EuroMaidan Revolution, also known as Revolution of Dignity, a decade later, which saw over 100 protesters killed by the security forces of then-President Yanukovych, the Orange Revolution remained remarkably nonviolent. &#x201C;The biggest difference between the Orange Revolution and the Revolution of Dignity was that we actually felt safe,&#x201D; Tsilyk said. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t recall ever feeling a sense of impending danger during that time.&#x201D; Many protesters also looked for ways to use their skills to support the revolution. As a journalism student, Tokariuk helped deliver a newspaper produced three times a day for the demonstrators who had gathered from all over the country. With no social media and few smartphones at the time, providing access to reliable information was essential. &#x201C;I was shouting, &#x2018;Latest news! Latest news!&#x2019; just like how newspapers were delivered in the old days,&#x201D; Tokariuk recalled. &#x201C;It felt incredible to be among the people, seeing how genuine our efforts were and how many had traveled from all over Ukraine to defend their choice (of Yuschenko). It was my first revolution. For many of us, it was our first experience of standing up for democracy.&#x201D; Ukraine&apos;s Supreme Court ruled on Dec. 3 that the election results could not be validated due to documented fraud, thereby annulling the results and triggering a second runoff vote. Under the watchful eye of both domestic and international election monitors, Ukrainians returned to the polls for a third time on Dec. 26. The Central Election Committee announced that Yuschenko had earned 51.99% of the vote and Yanukovych 44.20%. Yanukovych&#x2019;s inauguration as president occurred on Jan. 23, 2005, marking the end of the Orange Revolution. Vengryniuk recalled that the crowd was so massive at Yuschenko&#x2019;s inauguration that she began to worry that she would be crushed. Her friend&#x2019;s father helped move her through the swarms of people to a place where she could catch some air. &#x201C;Later, all of us &#x2014; adults and university students who had come together &#x2014; drank wine and pomegranate juice to regain our strength because the crowd had been so overwhelming,&#x201D; she said. Yushchenko would go on to face numerous challenges during his presidency, including infighting with political rivals and interference from powerful oligarchs whose influence he had hoped to subdue. The 2008 global financial crisis further compounded these setbacks in effective policy-making, as well as ongoing gas disputes with Russia, deepening his unpopularity among Ukrainians. During this period, Yanukovych and his pro-Russian Party of Regions planned their political comeback. &#x201C;Unfortunately, Russian propaganda was incredibly strong back then, and people voted for Yanukovych the next time around. I still believe Yushchenko was a good president, though &#x2014; second only to Petro Poroshenko,&#x201D; Vengryniuk said. Yanukovych won against Yuschenko&#x2019;s prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko in the 2010 presidential election, and Ukrainians, as Vengryniuk lamented, &#x201C;had no idea what Ukraine would still have to endure in the years to come.&#x201D; Nevertheless, the Orange Revolution served as a crucial moment of political awakening for those involved.

(Mladen Antonov / AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;The Orange Revolution helped me realize freedom and democracy are not free,&#x201D; Tokariuk said. &#x201C;They need to be protected and people need to defend their right to have free and fair elections.&#x201D; The success of the Orange Revolution also equipped many Ukrainians who participated with the resolve needed to face future challenges, including the Revolution of Dignity, the illegal annexation of Crimea, and the invasion of Donetsk and Luhansk a decade later, as well as Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war that erupted in 2022. &#x201C;Back then, I was overcome by this beautiful feeling that I am Ukrainian and we Ukrainians can do anything,&#x201D; Tsilyk said. &#x201C;Facing even bigger challenges today, I still carry this feeling with me today.&#x201D; Hi, this is Kate Tsurkan, thanks for reading this article. It was really empowering to hear from Ukrainians about their political awakening two decades ago and how that moment of triumph helped them brace for the hard times that would later come.

Ukraine to receive $4.8 billion from World Bank	Ukraine and the World Bank signed a loan agreement worth $4.8 billion, which Kyiv will use for priority budget expenditures, the Finance Ministry said in a statement. Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko and the World Bank&apos;s Eastern Europe Operations Manager Kevin Tomlinson signed the agreement for the loan on Nov. 22, which falls under the Public Expenditures for Administrative Capacity Endurance (PEACE) project. As the ongoing full-scale Russian invasion continues to put pressure on Ukraine&apos;s economy, the World Bank plays a crucial role in supporting the country. The agreement provides for financial assistance from the U.S. and other partners. The U.S. government provides funding through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and in coordination with the U.S. Departments of the Treasury and State. The funds are then transferred to Ukraine&apos;s State Budget within the PEACE project and have gone primarily to the payment of pensions for the elderly, grants to internally displaced persons, and wages for teachers, first responders and emergency services staff. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, about $35.5 billion has already been allocated through the PEACE project to support social expenditures of Ukraine&apos;s State Budget, Ukraine&apos;s Finance Ministry said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-receive-4-8-billion-from-world-bank/	2024-11-22T10:02:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1243546154.jpeg

According to Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, Russian forces have suffered 7,905 soldiers killed, 12,220 injured, and 717 captured during the three months of the Kursk offensive.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-has-deployed-nearly-60-000-troops-to-kursk-oblast-media-reports-2/	2024-11-22T09:48:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168599470.jpg
Nearly 580,000 Russian troops fighting against Ukraine, military intelligence says	Russia&apos;s ground forces participating in combat against Ukraine amount to almost 580,000 soldiers, Vadym Skibitskyi, the deputy head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), told Interfax Ukraine on Nov. 21. Russia has been looking to increase the number of personnel to fight its war against Ukraine. The Russian government&apos;s recently exempted defendants from criminal liability if they join the Russian army and introduced additional financial rewards for contract service to shore up more manpower. Skibitskyi clarified that the number of Russian troops includes those serving in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast as they fight off Ukraine&apos;s incursion into the area, Interfax Ukraine reported. About 60,000 Russian military personnel are currently serving in Kursk, Suspilne reported previously, citing its undisclosed source in the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. Skibitskyi added that a grouping of almost 35,000 Russian Guard troops, also known as Rosgvardia, was also deployed to the Russian-occupied territories in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in June that nearly 700,000 Russian troops were fighting in Ukraine. In October, Russian casualties amounted to 600,000 since the start of the full-scale invasion, according to Pentagon estimates. The figure came at a particularly deadly stage of the war for Russian troops. According to reports from the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, September was the second-most lethal month for Russian soldiers since February 2022. As casualties climb, Russian forces continue to press on in eastern Ukraine, focusing on the cities of Pokrovsk and Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast. Outnumbered and outgunned, Ukrainian soldiers are slowly losing ground under Russian pressure.	https://kyivindependent.com/nearly-580-000-russian-troops-engaged-in-combat-against-ukraine-military-intelligence-says/	2024-11-22T08:27:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1239919502-1.jpg
Russia likely used ballistic missile from 'Kedr' complex to strike Dnipro, intelligence says	The ballistic missile launched by Russia on Nov. 21 against the city of Dnipro was likely part of the &quot;Kedr&quot; missile complex tested in recent years, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. Several companies part of the Russian military-industrial complex were involved in developing &quot;Kedr,&quot; which was tested at the Kapustin Yar test site in 2023 and 2024, HUR said on Nov. 22. HUR&apos;s statement comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin said in his televised address to the nation on Nov. 21 that the attack was a test of Russia&apos;s &quot;newest missile,&quot; an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) called &quot;Oreshnik.&quot; The missile was launched at Dnipro from Russia&apos;s Astrakhan Oblast and covered nearly 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) in 15 minutes, according to HUR. The missile was equipped with six warheads, each carrying six submunitions. The speed on the final section of the missile&apos;s trajectory was over Mach (&#x41C;) 11. At a temperature of 15&#xB0;C (59&#xB0;F), the speed of 1 M in the atmosphere is 1,225 kilometers per hour (716 miles per hour). &quot;It is an experimental system. Let&apos;s just say it&apos;s a medium-range ballistic missile. It is a carrier of nuclear weapons. The fact that they used it in a non-nuclear version is, as they (Russians) say, a warning from them that they have not gone completely crazy,&quot; military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said at an event on Nov. 22. Budanov called Russia&apos;s latest development &quot;a prototype,&quot; adding that it is not currently in mass production. Russian media circulated information about the development of a missile system called &quot;Kedr&quot; in 2021, labeling it &quot;a new-generation strategic complex.&quot; Initial reports by Ukrainian authorities suggested that Russia had test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile to target Dnipro. Later that evening, Putin said the new &quot;Oreshnik&quot; IRBM had allegedly been used. Little is known about the &quot;Oreshnik&quot; missile referred to by Putin, but military expert Yan Matveev told Russian independent media outlet IStories that it could be a modified version of the &quot;Rubezh&quot; ICBM. The RS-26 &quot;Rubezh&quot; is reported to have a range of up to 6,000 kilometers and can carry four warheads, each with an estimated payload of 0.3 megatons.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-likely-used-ballistic-missile-from-kedr-complex-to-strike-against-dnipro-on-nov-21-intelligence-says/	2024-11-22T08:16:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2006245916.jpg
Opinion: Berlin's coalition drama puts Ukraine — and Europe — at risk	Donald Trump&#x2019;s re-election has sent political shockwaves across the Atlantic, pushing Germany &#x2014; Ukraine&#x2019;s second-largest donor &#x2014; into a decisive moment. The election has intensified internal divides and sparked a reckoning over Germany&#x2019;s role in European security. For years, German leaders deferred tough decisions on Ukraine, relying on U.S. leadership to navigate international crises. But Trump&#x2019;s isolationist rhetoric and unpredictable foreign policy have disrupted that balance, forcing Berlin to confront its priorities. The fallout has already upended Germany&#x2019;s ruling coalition, setting the stage for early elections in February. At the heart of this crisis is a budgetary impasse that exposes deep divisions within Germany&#x2019;s coalition government over how to address economic stagnation, inflation, and the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war. Trump&#x2019;s victory raised urgent questions about Germany&#x2019;s capacity &#x2014; and willingness &#x2014; to lead Europe in the face of Russian aggression. Germany&#x2019;s recent political turmoil stems from a long-standing constitutional constraint: the &#x201C;debt brake,&#x201D; which limits public borrowing. The Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens, part of the country&#x2019;s ruling coalition, pushed for loosening these rules to counter economic stagnation and fund critical programs, including aid for Ukraine. The fiscally conservative Free Democrats (FDP), the coalition&#x2019;s third component, resisted, insisting on strict adherence to fiscal discipline. While the coalition eventually agreed to breach the debt brake under extraordinary circumstances &#x2014; such as a dramatic escalation in Ukraine &#x2014; Trump&#x2019;s return tipped the scales. His re-election reignited fears of a more isolationist U.S., prompting Chancellor Olaf Scholz to frame Trump&#x2019;s victory as a &#x201C;fundamental change&#x201D; that demanded increased military and financial commitments to Ukraine. Yet, these proposals met resistance from the FDP, which suggested alternative funding mechanisms, such as using frozen Russian assets. The standoff proved insurmountable, leading to the coalition&#x2019;s collapse. Scholz has consistently emphasized Germany&#x2019;s 30 billion euros ($31.7 billion) in aid to Ukraine, framing the support as vital for both European security and long-term stability. &#x201C;A Russian victory would cost us much more,&#x201D; he asserted in a televised address following the coalition&#x2019;s collapse. However, his actions often fell short of his rhetoric. Over the past two years, Germany&#x2019;s contributions to Ukraine &#x2014; including tanks, air defense systems, and humanitarian aid &#x2014; have been incremental and politically contentious. Key military systems, like Taurus missiles, remain undelivered despite growing calls for stronger support. Public opinion has also shifted. Far-left and far-right voices now question the cost of the war, advocating negotiations with Russia. Parties like the far-left B&#xFC;ndnis Sarah Wagenknecht and the far-right Alternative f&#xFC;r Deutschland (AfD) have gained traction, particularly in economically weaker regions, by appealing to voters frustrated with rising gas prices and prolonged military involvement. Meanwhile, Germany&#x2019;s mainstream parties have struggled to articulate a clear endgame for the war or its broader implications.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Trump&#x2019;s re-election has thrust Germany into an uncomfortable spotlight, forcing it to reassess its reliance on U.S. leadership. For Ukrainians, who have tirelessly campaigned for German military support, this moment feels both urgent and uncertain. Activists continue to demand the delivery of advanced systems, like the Taurus missile, which could change the trajectory of the war. Yet Germany&#x2019;s hesitancy remains, with many decisions still tied to Washington&#x2019;s lead. The upcoming February elections could mark a decisive shift. Conservatives, currently leading in polls, have signaled stronger support for Ukraine, including commitments to deliver more military aid if Russian attacks on civilians persist. However, there&#x2019;s a catch: If the SPD joins the next government as a junior coalition partner, its pacifist leanings could again temper Germany&#x2019;s response at a critical juncture. Even within the SPD, opinions are evolving. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius recently acknowledged that Germany must become &#x201C;ready for war,&#x201D; signaling a potential shift in the party&#x2019;s stance. Yet Scholz&#x2019;s recent phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin &#x2014; criticized by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as &#x201C;opening Pandora&#x2019;s box&#x201D; &#x2014; underscores the precariousness of Germany&#x2019;s position. Trump&#x2019;s return to power has exposed Germany&#x2019;s vulnerabilities and its dependence on American leadership. The collapse of its coalition government is both a symptom and a consequence of these pressures, as economic, political, and geopolitical challenges collide. Germany now faces a stark choice: step into a leadership role in supporting Ukraine or remain reactive, paralyzed by internal divisions and external unpredictability. The February elections will be pivotal in determining Germany&#x2019;s future course. While a conservative-led government could bring renewed vigor to Ukraine&#x2019;s cause, the specter of continued SPD influence looms large. For Europe, this moment demands bold action and a departure from past hesitations. For Germany, it&#x2019;s an opportunity to define its legacy &#x2014; not as a reluctant actor, but as a leader shaping a new chapter for Ukraine and Europe.

Opinion: With soaring interest rates and stagflation risks, Russia will face deep economic crisis regardless of war’s outcome	The recent hike in Russia&#x2019;s key interest rate to 21% by the Central Bank in late October has stirred renewed debate among media and economists about the Russian economy&#x2019;s outlook and how economic trends could influence Kremlin policies. Today, few predict an &quot;imminent collapse&quot; of the Russian economy. However, signs of deteriorating trends and economic challenges confront Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s regime with a dilemma: continuing the aggressive war or quickly ending it are both likely to lead to an economic crisis. Observers point out several unique features of the Russian economy that cast doubt on claims of its &quot;sustainable development&quot; and &quot;prosperity.&quot; First, the current key rate is more than double the official annual inflation rate, resulting in a double-digit real interest rate &#x2014; an unusual scenario. This could suggest that actual inflation is much higher than official reports indicate and that inflation expectations among the public and businesses exceed the Russian Central Bank&apos;s estimates (over 13%). Even if official inflation figures aren&#x2019;t distorted, the calculation methods don&#x2019;t account for changes in the consumer basket due to sanctions, such as the replacement of Western goods with cheaper Chinese alternatives. Second, despite the high interest rate, loan volume continues to grow, as noted by Elvira Nabiullina, governor of the Bank of Russia &#x2014; a concern for the central bank. Credit growth is currently driven by increased business lending, while consumer lending has declined in response to high rates and the end of the subsidized &#x201C;preferential&#x201D; mortgage program in summer 2024. Commercial lending rates have risen to 25&#x2013;30% and above, signaling heightened inflation expectations, a shortage of working capital due to increased sanctions-related costs, and labor shortages. These factors create significant risks of defaults and bankruptcies. Third, the planned increase in budget spending for 2025 significantly exceeds even optimistic GDP growth projections. The Russian government has forecast real GDP growth at 2.5% for 2025. However, even Russian analysts suggest growth will likely not exceed 2%, and the International Monetary Fund recently lowered its 2025 forecast to 1.3%. Meanwhile, planned federal expenditures are set to rise by nearly 12% (from 37.2 trillion rubles in 2024 to 41.5 trillion in 2025). Direct military spending for 2025 is expected to reach an unprecedented 13.5 trillion rubles (about $140 billion). Even within Russia, economists doubt that the government&#x2019;s projected budget deficit of under 1% of GDP is realistic. This is reflected in declining liquid assets in the so-called &quot;National Wealth Fund,&quot; which, as of summer 2024, stood at just over $55 billion &#x2014; less than half of what it was at the start of the full scale war in 2022. The revival of the Russian economy in 2023&#x2013;24 is attributed to two main factors: stable oil and gas revenues and significant growth in war-related government spending. Despite sanctions, Russia has found new markets (mainly China and India), and has employed a &#x201C;shadow fleet&#x201D; and other strategies to evade sanctions. However, both the Russian Central Bank and the Russian parliament are now warning of stagflation (recession combined with high inflation). Resources are dwindling, fiscal stimuli are no longer effective, supply-side constraints (labor shortages and lack of access to technology and modern equipment) are intensifying, and production cannot keep up with demand, driving inflation. This trajectory will likely lead to a severe economic crisis; the only question is when. Ending the war also carries significant risks for the Russian economy. Exiting the &quot;Keynesian trap&quot; of increased budget expenditures will be painful, as a decrease in aggregate demand could worsen stagflation tendencies and trigger a major downturn and crisis.

(Alexander Kazakov / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)Over the course of the war, a significant &#x201C;war party&#x201D; has formed in Russia, involving both elites and ordinary citizens. Officials have gained new avenues for corrupt enrichment through sanctions circumvention schemes, while businesses have filled market gaps left by Western companies. Families of soldiers or those working directly or indirectly for the military-industrial complex are earning incomes they couldn&#x2019;t have imagined pre-war. By various estimates, direct war beneficiaries include 15 million people or more, comprising over 10% of the Russian population. Additionally, increased payouts in the contract army and military-adjacent sectors, coupled with an obvious labor shortage, have driven up wages in other parts of the economy. Though public opinion polls indicate broad support for the war, it&#x2019;s evident that the conflict has allowed a sizable portion of the population to escape the &quot;poverty trap.&quot; A return to pre-war conditions and the end of war-related expenditures will inevitably trigger an economic crisis and heightened social tension. By launching the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian regime set itself up for a dilemma in which both continuing and ending the war will almost certainly lead to an economic &#x2014; and possibly political &#x2014; crisis. Given this, it seems prudent for Ukraine&#x2019;s allies to make Russia&#x2019;s continued aggression significantly more painful. Enhancing sanctions to meaningfully reduce Russia&#x2019;s export revenues and restricting imports of critical technologies and equipment would serve this goal. The problem is not that sanctions &#x201C;don&#x2019;t work&#x201D; but that they&#x2019;ve been applied slowly and inconsistently, with enforcement often lacking. Sometimes, sanctions inadvertently benefit Russia; for example, capital outflow restrictions have consolidated capital domestically, providing Putin&#x2019;s regime with additional resources. A better approach would be to encourage the maximum outflow of capital &#x2014; including financial and human resources &#x2014; by avoiding restrictions on emigration opportunities for Russians opposing the regime. By intensifying sanctions and closing enforcement loopholes, the prospects for Russia&#x2019;s &#x201C;celebration&#x201D; of a prolonged, low-cost war will be sharply reduced, far below the five years or more predicted by a recent analysis in The Economist.

War in Ukraine at 'decisive stage,' risk of 'global conflict,' Poland's Tusk says	The war in Ukraine has reached a &quot;decisive phase,&quot; and the latest events demonstrate the real threat of a &quot;global conflict,&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Nov. 22. Tusk&apos;s comments came in the wake of Russia&apos;s attack on Dnipro a day earlier, in which Moscow claims a new missile, an intermediate-range ballistic missile (ICBM) called &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; was tested. Speaking at the Congress of the Polish Teachers&apos; Union, Tusk referred to what he called &quot;the events of the last dozen hours&quot; as demonstrating there is a &quot;serious and real threat of global conflict.&quot; &quot;It would be hard for me not to say a few fundamental words today about the situation, because it is historic,&quot; he said in comments reported by Polish outlet Radio Zet. &quot;The war in the east is entering its decisive phase. We all know it. We feel that the unknown is approaching. None of us knows the end of this conflict, but we know that it is currently taking on very dramatic dimensions.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin on Nov. 21 said his country had launched its &quot;newest missile&quot; in the attack on Dnipro, eastern Ukraine that morning. He said the test was in response to Ukraine targeting facilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk and Bryansk oblasts with long-range, Western-supplied ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles on Nov. 19 and 20. The Oreshnik missile is designed to carry nuclear weapons. However, Putin said it was not armed with a nuclear warhead in this instance. Poland, one of Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters, is being pressured by Russia over the new U.S. missile defense base that opened in northern Poland on Nov. 13, as reported by Reuters. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski also announced on Nov. 19 that key EU countries are ready to increase military and financial aid to Ukraine if the U.S. reduces its support.	https://kyivindependent.com/war-in-ukraine-at-decisive-stage-risk-of-global-conflict-polands-tusk-says/	2024-11-22T06:48:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183928589.jpg
Belarus Weekly: New Russian military doctrine to cover Belarus with nuclear umbrella	Belarus&#x2019; authorities are on full alert ahead of upcoming presidential elections in January 2025, new wave of police raids target relatives of political prisoners. Belarusian police conduct counter-protest drills to prevent &#x201C;manifestations of extremism and terrorism&#x201D; during the election campaign. Russia&#x2019;s military doctrine was updated, covering Belarus with a Russian nuclear umbrella. No change in the U.S. nuclear posture. Polish broadcaster TVP appoints new leadership to flagship Belarusian-language channel Belsat amid heated debate over the channel&apos;s independence and future. Record 49 Russian Shahed-type drones entered Belarus&#x2019;s airspace in October, Belarusian Hajun monitoring group reports. The Belarusian authorities have launched another wave of raids and arrests across the country ahead of the presidential elections scheduled for Jan. 26, 2025, targeting political prisoners&#x2019; relatives, human rights activists reported on Nov. 15. Since the previous presidential elections in 2020, which sparked nationwide protests, over 3,500 individuals have been recognized as political prisoners by human rights organizations. Nearly 1,300 of them remain behind bars. Over the four-year-long crackdown on dissent in Belarus, 65,000 people have been subjected to politically motivated persecution. Belarus&#x2019;s KGB security agency unleashed a new round of raids on Nov. 14, targeting the relatives of political prisoners in the country&#x2019;s Hrodna and Brest regions, and in the capital Minsk, according to reports by human rights groups Viasna, Dissidentby, and the &#x201C;Country to Live In&#x201D; foundation. The raids constitute the third attack in a &#x201C;terror campaign&#x201D; this autumn, potentially targeting several hundred people, says Andrei Stryzhak, the head of Solidarity Foundation BYSOL, a group helping to evacuate dissidents from Belarus and assisting those suffering from persecution in the country. The activist said the raids were occurring against the backdrop of an &#x201C;imaginary thaw&#x201D; in relations between the regime and its opponents, coinciding with the release of 31 political prisoners and the permitting by the authorities of a family visit to Maria Kalesnikava, a prominent opposition leader who had been held incommunicado for over 600 days. According to BYSOL&#x2019;s leader, this round of repression has hit the northern Belarusian regions of Polatsk and Navapolatsk. With the rapid approach of the presidential election, to be held ahead of schedule on Jan. 26, 2025, the regime of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has launched a &#x201C;pre-election intimidation campaign,&#x201D; human rights activists from the Viasna Center report. Belarusian police are to conduct exercises in Minsk and regional centers to ensure &#x201C;the prevention of manifestations of extremism and terrorism&#x201D; ahead of the January presidential elections, the Interior Ministry announced on Nov. 19. The 2025 Belarusian presidential elections, scheduled for Jan. 26, are intended to extend the rule of the country&#x2019;s dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, for a seventh consecutive term in office. The previous presidential race sparked protests nationwide after the pro-Lukashenko Central Elections Committee announced his victory amid widespread claims of vote rigging. The police drills, which were scheduled to take place between Nov. 19 and 22, were to &#x201C;demonstrate the readiness&#x201D; of the police to respond to possible &#x201C;complications of the situation in the country during the election campaign.&#x201D; The exercises involve practicing street closures, and using smoke, flash and gas bombs and special equipment to disperse protests. &#x201C;The goal (of the exercises) ... is to prevent manifestations of extremism and terrorism, the involvement of citizens in illegal actions, and the suppression of violations of public order,&#x201D; the Interior Ministry said in a post on its official Telegram channel. A video accompanying the post shows the detention of alleged offenders, scenes from a polling station, and shots of riot police countering groups of people with placards. Belarus Security Council Secretary Alexander Volfovich said the exercises were routine ones, but claimed that exiled opponents of the Lukashenko regime &#x201C;are using all levers and opportunities to try to sway the situation again.&#x201D; Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the Belarusian opposition leader who claimed to have beaten Lukashenko in the 2020 presidential election, said the exercises were intended to intimidate the opposition. &#x201C;Training to suppress citizens isn&#x2019;t a sign of strength &#x2013; it&#x2019;s a sign of fear,&#x201D; she wrote on X. Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed Russia&#x2019;s updated nuclear doctrine, providing for nuclear retaliation in the case of armed aggression against Belarus, according to a presidential decree published on the government website on Nov. 19. The revised deterrence policy suggests that &#x201C;aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies by a non-nuclear state with the support of a nuclear state&#x201D; could trigger a nuclear response. The updated doctrine also considers any large-scale cross-border attack involving aircraft, missiles, or drones to be grounds for consideration of a nuclear strike. The publication of the doctrine comes on the heels of the United States giving Ukraine permission to strike targets in Russia with the U.S.-supplied long-range missiles. The White House National Security Council said that Russia&#x2019;s lowered threshold for nuclear retaliation did not come as a surprise, but also provided no reason for the United States to adjust its own nuclear posture. Putin first proposed making changes to the doctrine on Sept. 25 amid discussions in the United States and the U.K. about allowing Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory with Western-supplied long-range conventional missiles. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, an ally of the Kremlin, welcomed the inclusion of Belarus under Russia&#x2019;s nuclear umbrella, saying it was &#x201C;long overdue.&#x201D; &#x201C;An attack on Belarus is World War III,&#x201D; Lukashenko said on Sept. 27, alleging NATO countries were deploying troops at the border with Belarus. Although a non-nuclear state, Belarus reportedly has Russian nuclear weapons deployed on its territory following the signing of the agreement on May 25, 2023 on placing Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. Lukashenko also attended Russian nuclear military drills, during a sudden inspection of the country&#x2019;s tactical nuclear weapons launchers in May 2024. Forty-nine Russian Shahed-type combat drones entered Belarus&#x2019;s airspace in October &#x2014; the highest number recorded in a month, the Belarusian Hajun war monitoring project wrote. Russian Shahed-type drones began to cross regularly into Belarus in July this year, with Ukraine reportedly using electronic warfare measures to send the drones off course. Amid intensified attacks against Ukraine in subsequent months, incursions of Russian drones into Belarus surged from infrequent, isolated instances to 27 stray drones being spotted over Belarus in September. Throughout October, 33 stray drones returned from Belarus to Ukrainian territory, while the location of 14 was lost, according to the monitoring group. One drone crashed in Kalinkavichy, roughly 60 kilometers from the Ukrainian border, overnight on Oct. 3, after three Shahed drones flew into Belarusian airspace. Lukashenko was traveling by helicopter over the country at the time of the drone incursion. Another UAV was downed by the Belarusian Air Force over the country&#x2019;s Homel Oblast overnight on Oct. 20. It was the second instance of the Belarusian military downing a Russian UAV since the incursions began. &#x201C;At the moment, there is no reason to believe that Russian UAVs of the Shahed-136/131 type will stop flying into Belarus in the near future,&#x201D; Belarusian Hajun said in its report. Lukashenko claimed on Oct. 4 that the Belarusian Air Force downs &#x201C;a lot of drones,&#x201D; both Russian and Ukrainian, and attributed the incursions to the work of radio-electronic warfare equipment and mistakes by drone operators. No proof of Ukrainian drones entering Belarusian airspace has ever been presented. Minsk, Russia&#x2019;s staunchest ally, has never publicly raised objections with Moscow over the reported drone incidents. Polish Public Broadcaster TVP has appointed new leadership to its flagship broadcaster for Belarus, Belsat, in a move to integrate the exiled Belarusian-language television channel into its Center for Foreign Language Programs &#x2013; despite calls for Belsat&#x2019;s operations to remain independent. On Nov. 15, TVP appointed Alina Koushyk, a former anchor and producer at Belsat, as the head of the Belarusian editorial office. Koushyk, who had left Belsat two years ago for a role in Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya&#x2019;s shadow cabinet, said, &#x201C;We aimed to advocate for Belsat to remain an independent channel, but unfortunately, our efforts did not succeed.&#x201D; The merger comes amid broader restructuring of Poland&#x2019;s state media following the defeat of the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party in the 2023 parliamentary elections, with the new government saying it was seeking to &#x201C;restore impartiality&#x201D; to TVP. The restructuring implies Belsat&#x2019;s formerly separate airtime will be split into three sections &#x2013; six hours each for Belarusian-language programming, the Russia-focused news channel Vot Tak, and a Ukrainian-language broadcaster that has yet to be formed. Koushyk replaces Aleksy Dzikawicki, a co-founder and acting director of Belsat, who on Nov. 19 requested that his contract be terminated. Dzikawicki said he had requested early dismissal to avoid having to carry out an order to formally liquidate Belsat as an independent entity within TVP. Belsat started broadcasting in 2007 as the first Belarusian-language TV channel, offering coverage in the Belarusian language, which has been gradually excluded from Belarusian public life by the Lukashenko regime. Belarus is low in the press freedom rating, ranking 157th among 180 countries in 2023. Almost no independent media are left in Belarus due to the Lukashenko regime&#x2019;s efforts to stamp out a free press, which have seen 40 media professionals prosecuted, outlets being branded as &#x201C;extremist,&#x201D; and punishments introduced for sharing &#x201C;extremist&#x201D; content. The potential downsizing of Belsat to only one of several editorial offices within the Center for Foreign Language Programs has drawn criticism from Belarusian opposition leaders. However, TVP World director and editor-in-chief Micha&#x142; Broniatowski has denied that Belsat will lose its independence after the merger, saying &#x201C;Belsat&#x2019;s editorial office will be fully Belarusian, there will be no &#x2018;orders&#x2019; to cover what the Foreign Ministry wants, or not to cover what it does not want covered.&#x201D; In March, Belsat, lost 47% of its total financing from the Foreign Ministry and Poland&#x2019;s TVP, and its longtime director, Agnieszka Romaszewska-Guzy, was dismissed. The International Press Institute (IPI) has urged Poland&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry to reconsider the decision, warning of the &#x201C;disastrous impact&#x201D; on the accessibility of independent Belarusian news. While acknowledging Poland&#x2019;s financial burden, the IPI called for measures to ensure Belsat&#x2019;s survival as a vital platform for European security. The restructuring is set to be finalized on March 1, 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-new-russian-military-doctrine-to-cover-belarus-with-nuclear-umbrella/	2024-11-22T04:46:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1798032839.jpg
North Korea received anti-aircraft missiles, oil from Russia in exchange for troops, reports say	Russia gave North Korea oil and anti-aircraft missiles in return for military support in Ukraine, according to a South Korean official, and satellite imagery analysis. North Korea has dispatched 10,000 troops to Russia, with most of them deployed in the western Kursk Oblast and taking part in combat, a Pentagon spokesperson said during a press briefing on Nov. 12. South Korea&apos;s national security advisor Shin Won-sik on Nov. 22 said Moscow had provided Pyongyang with economic and military technology in exchange for the troops. &quot;It is understood that North Korea has been provided with related equipment and anti-aircraft missiles to strengthen Pyongyang&apos;s weak air defense system,&quot; Shin said in an interview with South Korea&#x2019;s SBS News. Elsewhere, the BBC on Nov. 22 reported that Russia is estimated to have supplied North Korea with more than a million barrels of oil since March this year. The claim was based on an analysis of satellite imagery by the Open Source Centre, a non-profit research group based in the U.K. U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy told the BBC that the oil is payment for weapons and troops sent to Moscow to fuel the war in Ukraine. North Korean leader Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a strategic partnership agreement in June. Under the treaty, the two countries pledge to help each other if either is attacked. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui visited Moscow and met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Nov. 4. &quot;Our country will stand firmly by our Russian comrades until the day of victory,&quot; Choe said, calling Moscow&apos;s offensive against Ukraine a &quot;sacred struggle.&quot; Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K., claimed that the direct involvement of Russia&apos;s allies such as North Korea in the war against Ukraine was evidence of a global conflict.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-received-anti-aircraft-missiles-oil-from-russia-in-exchange-for-troops-reports-say/	2024-11-22T03:41:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157652819.jpg
Shahed drones that hit Sumy equipped with shrapnel munitions, regional governor says	Russian Shahed-type drones that attacked Sumy overnight were equipped with shrapnel munitions, Regional Governor Volodymyr Artiukh reported on Nov. 22. Russia struck a residential area in the city killing two people and injuring 12, according to local officials. &quot;These weapons are used to kill people. Not to destroy structures, just to kill more people,&quot; Artiukh said in a video uploaded to the Sumy Regional Military Administration&apos;s Telegram channel. &quot;Just as the previous missile strike [had] cluster munitions, today again drones [are] equipped with shrapnel,&quot; he added. &quot;The same goes for other strikes, in other places where private homes were hit, people were injured and killed. This is pure genocide.&quot; The Sumy regional prosecutor&apos;s office is conducting a pre-trial investigation into potential &quot;war crimes resulting in the deaths of people.&quot; Sumy Oblast borders Russia&apos;s Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod oblasts. Residents of the vulnerable border communities experience multiple attacks per day.	https://kyivindependent.com/shahed-drones-that-hit-sumy-equipped-with-shrapnel-munitions-regional-governor-says/	2024-11-22T02:32:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-22-at-12_24_00.png
White House sees no indication of Russia preparing to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine	The Biden administration has not seen any &quot;indications of Russia preparing to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine,&quot; &#xA0;White House Press Secretary Karin Jean-Pierre said on Nov. 21. Speaking at a press briefing, Jean-Pierre also said the administration was &quot;not surprised by Russia&apos;s announcement that it would update its nuclear doctrine,&quot; and they believed it was &quot;irresponsible rhetoric.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the country&apos;s new nuclear doctrine on Nov. 19. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the changes should be seen as a &quot;certain signal&quot; to the West. &quot;This is more of the same irresponsible rhetoric that we continue to hear from Russia, which we have seen for more than two years now, if you think about their aggression, their war against Ukraine,&quot; Jean-Pierre said. &quot;We haven&#x2019;t seen any indications of Russia preparing to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine. &#xA0;We just have not seen that. &quot;And observing no changes to Russia&#x2019;s nuclear posture, we have not seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear posture or doctrine in response to Russia&#x2019;s statements.&quot; Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh on Nov. 20 also dismissed Russia&#x2019;s rhetoric surrounding its nuclear policy as a continuation of its behavior over the past two years. Since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has made a series of nuclear threats against Ukraine and the West, none of which have materialized.	https://kyivindependent.com/white-house-sees-no-indication-of-russia-preparing-to-use-nuclear-weapons-in-ukraine/	2024-11-22T02:00:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2036341931.jpg
Russia's experimental weapons 'will not change the course of the war,’ NATO says	Russia&apos;s use of a purported new ballistic missile &quot;will not change the course of the conflict, or deter NATO allies from supporting Ukraine,&quot; NATO spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah said on Nov. 21. Dakhlallah&apos;s comments came after Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country had launched its &quot;newest missile,&quot; an IRBM called &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; in an attack on Dnipro in eastern Ukraine earlier that day. &quot;The Russian attack on Dnipro on Thursday is yet another example of Russia&apos;s attacks on Ukrainian cities,&quot; Dakhlallah said in comments reported by the Guardian and AFP. Putin said the attack was in response to Ukraine targeting facilities in Russian oblasts using Western-supplied long-range missiles. On Nov. 17 U.S. President Joe Biden allowed Ukraine to use ATACMS missiles to strike deep into the territory of the Russian Federation. On Nov. 19, Ukraine launched ATACMS missiles for the first time in Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast, and on Nov. 20, it made its first use of UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles. After depicting such a move as crossing another &quot;red line&quot; the Kremlin had drawn, Russian President Vladimir Putin previously said his country would respond. &quot;They probably considered testing a nuclear warhead, which was also rumored to happen soon, but decided that&apos;s too intense, and that could invite too much backlash, especially from partners, such as China and India,&quot; Fabian Hoffmann, a defense expert and doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;They probably thought that (the IRBM strike) is the next best option because it sends a clear signal to the West, while potentially not antagonizing critical international partners,&quot; he added. &quot;So this strike is not for military value, this is purely, purely for political purposes.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-experimental-weapons-will-not-change-the-course-of-the-war-nato-says/	2024-11-22T01:31:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185213511.jpg
Ukrainian parliament meeting canceled due to credible threat of Russian strike in Kyiv, source confirms	A Ukrainian parliament meeting scheduled for Nov. 22 has been canceled due to the credible threat of a targeted Russian strike on government buildings in Kyiv, a Ukrainian lawmaker speaking on condition of anonymity told the Kyiv Independent. Lawmakers were planning to hold an hour-long Q&amp;A session at the Verkhovna Rada, the source added. An air raid alert was on in Kyiv and several central and eastern oblasts in the late morning of Nov. 22 due to a reported drone threat. The development comes amid escalating tensions in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Nov. 21 said his country had launched its &quot;newest missile,&quot; an IRBM called &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; in an attack on Dnipro, eastern Ukraine that morning. He said the test was in response to Ukraine targeting facilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk and Bryansk oblasts with long-range, Western-supplied ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles on Nov. 19 and 20. The Oreshnik missile is designed to carry nuclear weapons. However, Putin said it was not armed with a nuclear warhead in this instance. Putin warned that Russia would use weapons against any country whose arms are used to strike Russian targets.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-parliament-meeting-canceled-due-to-threat-of-russian-strike-source-confirms/	2024-11-22T00:59:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167201231.jpg
North Korea's Kim accuses US of stoking potential 'thermonuclear war'	North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Nov. 21 accused the U.S. of stoking global tensions that could escalate &quot;into the most destructive thermonuclear war.&quot; Speaking at a military exhibition in Pyongyang, Kim claimed his previous experience of negotiating with Washington had proved to him that the U.S. was &quot;aggressive and hostile&quot; towards his country. &quot;Never before have the warring parties on the Korean peninsula faced such a dangerous and acute confrontation that it could escalate into the most destructive thermonuclear war,&quot; he said in comments reported by Reuters. &quot;We have already gone as far as we can on negotiating with the United States, but what we became certain of from the result is not the superpower&apos;s willingness to coexist, but its thorough stance of power and aggressive and hostile policy toward us that can never change.&quot; Kim&apos;s comments came on the same day that Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country had launched its &quot;newest missile,&quot; an IRBM called &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; in an attack on Dnipro, eastern Ukraine that morning. He said the test was in response to Ukraine targeting facilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk and Bryansk oblasts with long-range, Western-supplied ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles on Nov. 19 and 20.

2 killed, 12 injured in Russia's attack on Sumy	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia struck a residential area in the city of Sumy overnight on Nov. 22 with Shahed drones, killing two people and injuring 12, local authorities reported. First responders have been dispatched to the site of the attack, and rescue operations continue as of 7 a.m. local time. Sumy Oblast Military Administration did not provide further details at the time of publication. Russian strikes against Ukraine&apos;s northeastern Sumy Oblast have become increasingly destructive in recent months amid fears that Russia may launch a new attack on Sumy Oblast in the coming months. Russia&apos;s overnight missile attacks on Sumy on Nov. 18 killed 11 and injured 89, including 11 children, after a ballistic missile struck a residential building. Sumy Oblast borders Russia&apos;s Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod oblasts.

Ukraine's former commander-in-chief says Russia’s allies’ involvement signals global conflict	Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K., claimed that World War III is underway. Speaking at the Ukrainska Pravda-100 award ceremony on Nov. 20, Zaluzhnyi pointed to the direct involvement of Russia&apos;s allies in the war against Ukraine as evidence of a global conflict. &quot;I believe that in 2024, we can absolutely assume that World War III has begun,&quot; Zaluzhnyi said. He emphasized that Ukraine is no longer fighting Russia alone. &quot;Ukraine is facing soldiers from North Korea. Let&apos;s be honest. Iranian-made Shaheds [loitering munitions] are killing civilians in Ukraine quite openly. It&apos;s missiles made in North Korea that are being launched onto Ukraine, and they are openly declaring this. Chinese-made shells are exploding in Ukraine, and Chinese parts are used in Russian missiles.&quot; Zaluzhnyi argued that military experts widely agree these developments signify a world war. He urged global leaders to recognize the situation and take decisive action. &quot;What we&apos;ve expected for so long has started. But I want to say that God Himself is giving a chance, not only to Ukraine but to the whole world, to have time to draw the correct conclusions now,&quot; Zaluzhnyi said. &quot;It&apos;s still possible to stop it here, on the territory of Ukraine. But for some reason, our partners do not want to understand this. It&apos;s obvious that Ukraine already has too many enemies. Ukraine will survive through technology, but it is unclear whether it can win this battle alone. So I believe that the world war has already begun.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-former-commander-in-chief-says-russias-allies-involvement-signals-global-conflict/	2024-11-21T20:30:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173728155.jpg
US warned Ukraine, other allies ahead of Putin's 'experimental intermediate-range ballistic' attack	Russia launched a new type of intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) against Dnipro, eastern Ukraine, on the morning of Nov. 21. A U.S. official confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that the U.S. warned Kyiv ahead of the attack that this type of weapon may be used against Ukraine. &quot;Russia likely possesses only a handful of these experimental missiles,&quot; the official said, adding that Ukraine has withstood countless attacks from Russia, including from missiles with significantly larger warheads than this weapon. Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed in a televised address to the nation later that day that the attack was a test of Russia&apos;s &quot;newest missile,&quot; an IRBM called &quot;Oreshnik.&quot; The attack came in the wake of Ukraine&apos;s apparent first successful strike on a military target inside Russia using the U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles. Putin said the strike was a direct response to the U.S. and the U.K. jointly approving Ukraine&#x2019;s use of Western-supplied long-range missiles to target Russia. The Russian missile targeted an industrial enterprise in the city, and two fires broke out following the attack, Governor Serhii Lysak said. A rehabilitation center for people with disabilities was damaged as well. At least two people are reported to have been injured. &quot;Russia may be seeking to use this capability to try to intimidate Ukraine and its supporters or generate attention in the information space, but it will not be a game-changer in this conflict,&quot; the official told the Kyiv Independent. Little is known about the &quot;Oreshnyk&quot; missile referred to by Putin, but military expert Yan Matveev told IStories that it could be a modified version of the Rubezh. The RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile is reported to have a range of up to 6,000 kilometers and can carry four warheads, each with an estimated payload of 0.3 megatons. Fabian Hoffmann, a defense expert and doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo, told the Kyiv Independent that the Rubezh is equipped with a MIRV payload, which stands for Multiple Independent Reentry Vehicles. Ukraine&apos;s U.S.-supplied Patriots have been effective at intercepting the ballistic missiles launched by Russia to date, but according to Defense Express, they are not currently optimized to intercept ICBMs. If Russia began to regularly launch ICBMs, Ukraine&apos;s air defenses would need to be bolstered by more advanced air defense systems like the THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense), the outlet reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-warned-ukraine-other-allies-ahead-of-putins-experimental-intermediate-range-ballistic-attack/	2024-11-21T18:36:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-21_10-53-05--3-.jpg
High-ranking North Korean general injured in Ukrainian strike on Kursk, WSJ reports	A high-ranking North Korean general was wounded in a recent Ukrainian missile strike on Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Nov. 21, citing undisclosed sources. This marked the first injury of a senior North Korean military figure confirmed by Western officials. The WSJ source noted that the attack may have targeted a command post used by Russian and North Korean forces near the Bariatinsky estate in Maryino. The general&#x2019;s identity and the circumstances of the injury remain undisclosed. North Korea has dispatched 10,000 troops to Russia, with most of them deployed in the western Kursk Oblast and taking part in combat, a Pentagon spokesperson said during a press briefing on Nov. 12.

Russia pre-notified US of 'Oreshnik' missile strike before attack on Dnipro	Russia gave the U.S. a brief advance warning of the intermediate-range ballistic missile strike on Dnipro before the attack, according to comments a U.S. administration official made at a briefing on Nov. 21. &#x201C;The United States was pre-notified briefly before the launch, through nuclear risk reduction channels,&#x201D; Defense Department Deputy Spokesperson Sabrina Singh said. The warning, sent 30 minutes before the launch, was also confirmed by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. The U.S. had previously alerted Ukraine and its allies that Russia might test such an experimental missile. In the early hours of Nov. 21, a country-wide air raid alert sounded due to the threat of ballistic missiles, and later, the launch of several Russian Tu-95MS bomber aircraft. According to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force, the attack targeted the city of Dnipro using a number of different missile types. Late on Nov. 21, Putin said in a televised address that the attack was a test of Russia&apos;s &quot;newest missile,&quot; an IRBM called &quot;Oreshnik.&quot; Russia regularly uses close, and short range ballistic missiles in aerial attacks against Ukraine, but IRBMs and ICBMs are far larger, can be equipped with nuclear payloads, and are designed to hit targets at far longer ranges.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-pre-notified-us-of-oreshnik-missile-strike-before-attack-on-dnipro/	2024-11-21T14:47:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1228238620.jpg
UK sanctions Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash and others in anti-corruption crackdown	The U.K. has sanctioned Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash, along with Angolan billionaire Isabel dos Santos, and Latvian politician Aivars Lembergs, according to the U.K. government&#x2019;s website statement on Nov. 21. The statement noted that freezing their assets is part of a crackdown on global corruption and &quot;dirty money.&quot; Firtash allegedly laundered hundreds of millions of pounds from Ukraine and invested significant amounts of the gains in U.K. property. His wife, Lada Firtash, was also sanctioned as she &#x201C;profited from his corruption and holds UK assets on his behalf.&#x201D; Foreign Secretary David Lammy emphasized the sanctions as a step toward holding corrupt elites accountable for exploiting public resources. Firtash, formerly a close associate of pro-Russian ex-President Viktor Yanukovych, accumulated much of his wealth by buying Russian gas and selling it in his home country. U.S. prosecutors charged Firtash with racketeering and bribery in 2014 and he was briefly arrested in Austria before posting bail. The Ukrainian tycoon has so far avoided extradition from Austria&apos;s capital, where he resides.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-sanctions-ukrainian-oligarch-dmytro-firtash-and-others-in-anti-corruption-crackdown/	2024-11-21T13:33:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/WhatsApp-Image-2023-10-03-at-11.25.04.jpg
Recent Russian attacks hit 3 of Ukrainian energy giant DTEK's 5 operational thermal power plants, Reuters reports	Russia&#x2019;s missile strikes on Nov. 16-17 hit three of the five operational thermal power plants owned by Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy company, DTEK, leaving one plant offline, Reuters reported on Nov. 21, citing unnamed sources. The strikes targeted energy facilities across Ukraine in one of the heaviest assaults on the country&#x2019;s power grid since the start of the full-scale war, with Russia launching approximately 120 missiles and 90 drones. DTEK reported &#x201C;heavy damage&#x201D; to its equipment following the attack, marking the eighth mass assault on its energy plants this year. According to the source, two of the damaged facilities have resumed partial electricity production, while the third remains offline. An unnamed official confirmed to Reuters that power plants and distribution stations were damaged during the Nov. 17 strikes but declined to provide specific figures on power losses, calling the information &#x201C;too sensitive.&#x201D; Ukraine reintroduced rolling blackouts on Nov. 18, with outages lasting four to eight hours at a time and occurring multiple times daily. Officials have warned that Russia may continue targeting the energy grid as winter approaches, repeating a strategy used during spring and summer and throughout the autumn-winter season of 2022-2023. In September, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian attacks had destroyed all of Ukraine&#x2019;s thermal power plants and most of its hydroelectric capacity. Ukrainian authorities and energy companies have been working to repair and reinforce the grid in anticipation of renewed attacks. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), Ukraine&#x2019;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter&#x2014;around one-third of peak demand. By comparison, the summer shortage was 2.5 GW, which already resulted in prolonged blackouts in Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/recent-russian-attacks-hit-3-of-ukrainian-energy-giant-dteks-5-operational-thermal-power-plants-reuters-reports/	2024-11-21T12:22:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2147766702.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia launched new 'Oreshnik' intermediate-range ballistic missile against Ukraine, Putin claims	Key developments on Nov. 21: Russian President Vladimir Putin said that during the Nov. 21 strike on Dnipro, Russia tested a new intermediate-range ballistic missile &#x2014; Oreshnik (Hazel). Russian forces launched a missile attack on the city earlier in the day, reportedly using a new type of ballistic missile. Ukrainian authorities have not confirmed the type of missile used in the strike. Putin claimed Ukraine targeted facilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk and Bryansk oblasts with long-range ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles on Nov. 19 and 20. In response, Russian forces launched a combined attack on a defense industry facility in Dnipro, according to the Russian president. The Oreshnik missile is designed to carry nuclear weapons. However, Putin said it was not armed with a nuclear warhead in this instance.Putin warned that Russia would use weapons against any country whose arms are used to strike Russian targets.Putin claimed that the U.S. was allegedly planning to produce and deploy medium- and shorter-range missiles in Ukraine. The Russian president also promised that he would warn Ukrainian civilians and citizens of other countries in advance to leave the area of possible weapons impact.President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier that Putin is using Ukraine as &quot;a testing ground&quot; by launching missiles at Ukrainian cities.The recent attack against damaged an industrial enterprise, two houses, and nine garages and caused two fires, said Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Governor Serhii Lysak. A rehabilitation center for people with disabilities was also damaged, Mayor Borys Filatov said.Two people were injured in the strike. Russian authorities reported Ukrainian drone strikes against the border regions of Rostov and Voronezh on Nov. 21, claiming that an industrial facility had been hit. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed that its forces intercepted two drones over the two regions, making no mention of possible damage or whether some of the drones slipped through the defenses. Yuri Slyusar, the acting governor of Rostov Oblast, said on his Telegram channel that a fire broke out at an industrial facility in the central Konstantinovsky district because of a &quot;drone crash.&quot; Slyusar claimed that firefighters quickly extinguished the fire. The type of the facility and the full extent of damage were not specified. Another drone was reportedly downed in Rostov Oblast&apos;s Myasnikovsky district, inflicting no damage. No casualties were reported. The airport in the city of Volgograd, lying northeast of Rostov Oblast, temporarily suspended operations due to safety concerns, the Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) reported. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all of the claims. Kyiv launches regular drone strikes against Russian territory, targeting military and industrial facilities to undermine Russia&apos;s war effort in Ukraine. Two industrial facilities &#x2013; including a factory producing cargo drones for the Russian military &#x2013; and a military arsenal were allegedly hit during drone attacks overnight on Nov. 20. Hungary is deploying air defense systems near the Ukrainian border, citing increased risks after the West allowed the use of long-range weapons inside Russian territory, Defense Minister Kristof Szalay-Bobrovniczky said on Nov. 20. The minister ordered the deployment of air defense systems in the country&apos;s northeastern regions, saying that &quot;the war has entered its most dangerous phase.&quot; Szalay-Bobrovniczky attributed this escalation namely to the easing of restrictions on Ukrainian strikes with Western arms and linked it to Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s approval of an updated nuclear doctrine. This decision comes after two Russian missiles were shot down on Nov. 17 in Zakarpattia Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s westernmost region bordering Hungary and home to an estimated 75,000 ethnic Hungarians. On that occasion, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that it was necessary to &quot;strengthen efforts to bring peace&quot; as &quot;each day brings with it the risk of escalating war.&quot; Budapest has consistently criticized and obstructed Western military support for Ukraine, claiming it would lead to an escalation, and has maintained warm ties with Moscow throughout the full-scale war. Previously, Russian drones and missiles launched during strikes on Ukraine have crossed into the airspace of other countries, namely Poland, Latvia, Romania, Moldova, and Belarus. The latest development in Hungary follows a series of increasingly strong resolutions by Ukraine&apos;s Western allies. After U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken pledged that the Biden administration would bolster support for Kyiv before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, President Joe Biden on Nov. 17 allowed Ukraine to use ATACMS missiles to strike deep inside Russian territory. Ukraine reportedly used ATACMS missiles to strike a Russian military arsenal in Bryansk Oblast on Nov. 19 and allegedly also used U.K.-supplied Storm Shadow on Nov. 20, marking the first instance of these weapons being used on Russian soil. Other Western allies have expressed their position on their own supplied weapons. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Nov. 18 that Paris &quot;remained open&quot; to allowing Ukraine to use French long-range missiles to strike military targets inside Russia, reported Le Monde. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said that she &quot;understands&quot; the U.S. response to Russia, but Rome makes a &quot;different choice&quot; and focuses on air defenses for Ukraine. Russian forces are suspected of summarily executing a group of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POW) in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets reported on Nov. 20. Lubinets said that the prisoners were &quot;surrounded&quot; but gave no other details, in particular on the number of victims. Reports of murders, torture, and ill-treatment of Ukrainian POWs are received regularly by Ukrainian authorities and have spiked in recent months. &quot;I have sent letters to the U.N. and the ICRC about this crime,&quot; Lubinets said, reporting the suspected crime on his Telegram channel. &quot;The international community must act immediately. The occupying country has once again violated the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war,&quot; he added. The Armyinform news outlet ties this announcement to a video taken by a drone camera purporting to show the execution. It shows 10 unarmed people lying on the ground with at least five armed men standing over them. &#xA0;At one point, they start shooting at the people on the ground. Heavy fighting has been ongoing in the Russian border region of Kursk since Ukraine launched an offensive there in early August. Earlier the same day, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office announced another shooting of captured Ukrainian military personnel by Russian troops in the Pokrovsk area in Ukraine. Former Prosecutor General Kostin on Oct. 15 called the killing of captured Ukrainian service members in captivity a &quot;deliberate policy of the Russian Federation.&quot; The execution of prisoners of war constitutes a grave violation of the Geneva Convention. Russian forces had executed at least 124 Ukrainian prisoners of war since 2022 as of Nov. 6, authorities said at the time, while the number continues to grow. On top of that, at least 177 Ukrainian prisoners have died in Russian captivity, according to a representative of the Ukrainian Coordination Center for the Treatment of Prisoners of War. The Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is on the verge of a blackout after Russian attacks on power lines left the plant connected to only one line, the Energy Ministry reported on Nov. 21. This is the second time this week that the plant has been seriously threatened by a blackout, which could compromise conditions for safe operation and cause an accident. At the moment, the plant is connected to the Ukrainian power grid by only one transmission line. Similar incidents have been reported throughout the full-scale war, with Kyiv accusing Russia of threatening the security of the plant. Russia has occupied the Zaporizhzhia plant, the largest nuclear station in Europe, since March 2022. Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko confirmed that if the last line is cut off, there will be a complete blackout, as reported by the Energy Ministry&apos;s Telegram channel. The Zaporizhzhia plant is not the only one causing concern. The Khmelnytskyi, Rivne, and Southern Ukrainian plants were forced to decrease output on Nov. 17 after a massive Russian aerial strike targeted several substations critical to their power supply. Greenpeace warned that Ukraine&apos;s power grid was at &quot;heightened risk of catastrophic failure&quot; after the mass missile and drone attack targeted the electrical substations. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, confirmed in a statement on Nov. 17 that Ukraine&apos;s nuclear power plants had to reduce their electricity production as a precautionary measure due to large-scale missile attacks. The attacks on Ukraine&apos;s infrastructure led to &quot;increased nuclear safety and security risks,&quot; Grossi agreed. Allowing Ukraine to regain control &quot;is the only way to ensure the safe operation of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant,&quot; Halushchenko said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-launches-new-oreshnik-intermediate-range-ballistic-missile-against-ukraine/	2024-11-21T12:12:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-21_10-53-05.jpg
UK prepared to fight Russia if it invades Eastern European NATO member, British general says	The U.K. is prepared to send its soldiers to fight Russia if it invades a NATO country on the alliance&apos;s eastern flank, Rob Magowan, the deputy chief of the British defense staff, said on Nov. 21, Politico reported. Concerns over rising Russian aggression are growing in Europe, fueled by Moscow&apos;s advances in eastern Ukraine. Uncertainty about Europe&#x2019;s readiness to defend itself has been compounded by Republican Donald Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. presidential election. During his campaign, Trump repeatedly stated that the U.S. might not support allies that fail to meet NATO defense spending commitments. When asked how many British brigades could be deployed to NATO&apos;s eastern flank in the event of significant Russian escalation, Magowan assured lawmakers that the U.K. would respond immediately if called upon. &quot;I don&apos;t think anybody in this room should be under any illusion that if the Russians invaded Eastern Europe tonight, then we would meet them in that fight,&quot; Magowan told the House of Commons defense committee. Magowan noted that the British Armed Forces possess &quot;a range of operational risks and operational strengths.&quot; His comments follow the U.K. Defense Ministry&apos;s announcement on Nov. 21 that the British Army had completed live-fire testing of its Archer mobile howitzer, a rapidly deployable artillery system. The tests were conducted during a 12-day NATO exercise in Finland. Despite this, the British government has expressed concern over the state of its military, with the British Army now at its smallest size since the 1700s, Politico reported. In an interview last month, U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said the condition of the armed forces was &quot;far worse than we thought&quot; when his Labor Party took office this summer. The government is currently conducting a Strategic Defense Review, according to the outlet.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-prepared-to-fight-russia-if-it-invades-eastern-european-nato-member-british-general-says/	2024-11-21T11:33:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1253226504.jpg
Investigation: Who helped Russians increase production of domestic attack drones despite sanctions	An American-made HIMARS artillery system races down a Ukrainian road as a kamikaze drone hunts it down. The drone flies into the vehicle, followed by an explosion. The scene was caught on video by a Russian reconnaissance drone in mid-November. The drone that hit the HIMARS was a Lancet &#x2014; one of Russia&#x2019;s most used unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Russia has used thousands of them against Ukraine. The weapons are produced by Zala Aero Group, a privately-owned group of Russian companies, with the state holding a minority stake in one of its entities. It is one of the largest manufacturers of Russian combat drones attacking Ukraine. Like other Russian defense producers, the group has been targeted by Western sanctions and export restrictions that seek to undercut the Russian war effort by prohibiting the sale of defense-related parts and tech to Russia. In theory, the sanctions are supposed to be effective against the production of drones, which are highly dependent on imported parts. In reality, the use of Zala Aero&#x2019;s drones in the Russian war against Ukraine has been growing. Over the past year, it tripled. An investigation by the Kyiv Independent has found that Zala Aero has managed to continue to grow, despite sanctions, by feeding its production through a reliable system of Chinese suppliers. The investigation started when the Kyiv Independent obtained emails of Zala Aero Group employees that were hacked by Ukrainian intelligence. The emails illustrate how much Zala Aero&apos;s drone production depends on imported components. The Kyiv Independent tracked down Russian tax data on the suppliers of the Zala Aero Group and Russian customs records on the imported goods it was purchasing. This revealed the ecosystem of suppliers &#x2014; foreign and domestic &#x2014; that feed Zala Aero&#x2019;s drone production. Having read through thousands of lines of Zala Group business transactions and hundreds of work papers, the Kyiv Independent can now show how China came to the aid of this part of the Russian military machine, likely supplying it with more than just Chinese components. We also looked into what can be done to close the loopholes and stop Russia&apos;s deadly drone production, which is still dependent on imports. The most well-known military products of the Russian Zala Group are the Lancet attack drones and Zala reconnaissance UAVs. The Lancet kamikaze drones attack Ukrainian infantry and military vehicles, while the reconnaissance drones work alongside them, serving as the eyes of the Russian army to help identify targets. L: Russian Lancet attack drone. R: Zala reconnaissance drone. (Zala Aero)Lancet kamikaze drones can&#x2019;t fly as far as Iranian Shaheds and their Russian-made versions, the Geran, which attack Ukrainian cities far from the battlefield every night. Instead, Lancet drones are used on the battlefield, targeting the Ukrainian military along the entire front line. Lancets can carry 3-5 kilograms of explosives and fly 20-40 miles &#x2014; enough to damage, and sometimes destroy, large military vehicles, including tanks, artillery systems, and planes on the ground. Russia first used them in Syria. Since mid-2022, Lancets have been a mainstay of the Russian drone arsenal in Ukraine. Zala doesn&#x2019;t just supply the Russian war &#x2014; it appears to fully align itself with it. Zala Aero Group publicly brags about fresh Lancet attacks on equipment provided to Ukraine by its partners. The group claims Lancets have hit German Leopard and American Abrams tanks, American Paladin, British M777, and French Caesar howitzers, as well as Ukrainian-made vehicles. &#x201C;Targets are being hit round-the-clock,&#x201D; one of the company&#x2019;s social media posts boasted of the use of Lancets in October 2024. &#x201C;The work is carried out along the entire front line and in the rear.&#x201D; Among the hacked emails obtained by the Kyiv Independent, there is a letter by a Russian army commander, dated April 2023. In the letter, he addresses the CEO of Zala Aero, commending the company&#x2019;s instructors who help in training the Russian military to operate their drones. &#x201C;I look forward to further cooperation,&#x201D; the letter concludes, &#x201C;and increasing the production and supply of unmanned aerial vehicles and loitering munitions.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s exactly what happened next &#x2014; Zala began producing more drones. Russia has used around 7,000 Lancet drones against Ukraine as of early November 2024, the Ukrainian Air Force told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;There is a steady increase in the use of these munitions,&#x201D; they added. A Russian site monitoring military equipment losses, Lostarmour, lists over 2,500 Lancet drone attacks against Ukraine, confirmed by video evidence. Even this limited data is enough to spot a clear trend: The confirmed use of Lancet drones in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine in the first 10 months of 2024 increased almost threefold compared to the same period in 2023: 1,654 cases versus 629, according to Lostarmour. &#x201C;Up to eight Lancets can fly over us per day, and they always work in tandem with Zala drones that guide attack drones,&#x201D; a Ukrainian soldier currently participating in the operation in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Region told the Kyiv Independent. The soldier is not publicly identified due to security restrictions. Besides the effect on the battlefield, there is another indicator that Zala is growing its output: The group has been investing in production. Since mid-2022, they started building new production facilities and buying equipment, according to Agiya Zagrebelska, a Ukrainian expert on sanctions policy who has been closely watching Zala. The internal documents obtained by the Kyiv Independent also show that, after the start of the full-scale war, the company has bought new equipment. In September 2022, one of the Zala Aero Group&apos;s key companies, Aeroscan, ordered seven milling machines for a total of nearly $800,000. These machines are used in drone production that were manufactured by the Chinese company YangSen. There wouldn&#x2019;t be anything odd about a military manufacturer growing in the time of war &#x2014; except that this manufacturer can&#x2019;t work without imported parts, which international sanctions have cut off &#x2014; in theory. Like all kamikaze drones, Lancets self-destruct when they attack, making it difficult to analyze their hardware. One thing is certain: A lot of their parts aren&#x2019;t of Russian origin. The internal correspondence contains an audio recording of a meeting between representatives of the Russian government and drone manufacturers that offers a glimpse into just how concerned they were with the industry&#x2019;s dependence on imports. The meeting most likely took place in Moscow in February 2023. At one point, Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s special representative for technological development, and a namesake of the Russian president&#x2019;s notorious spokesman, appears to pop up into the room &#x2014; the meeting&#x2019;s chairman notes his brief appearance, but Peskov isn&#x2019;t heard talking. The meeting focused on the upcoming Unmanned Aircraft Systems project &#x2014; a Russian state program that aims to support and grow the Russian drone industry from 2024 to 2030. The project has since been approved and launched. Almost every person speaking at the meeting raised the problem of drone manufacturers&apos; dependence on imported electronic components and engines. &#x201C;I&apos;m very much concerned about components, I&apos;m very much concerned about onboard electronic equipment,&#x201D; the meeting&#x2019;s chairman, whom we identified as Vasilii Shpak, deputy industry and trade minister of Russia, said at the beginning of the meeting, setting the tone. During the conversation, Shpak noted he had a wealth of experience in delivering components from anywhere in the world to meet the needs of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. &#x201C;The more serious difficulties we face are the lack of domestic motors for our heavy machines that we want to launch&#x2026; and the fact that some of the components we want to replace are not always available in Russia,&#x201D; said Nickolay Burdin, commercial director of the Russian private company Aeromax. &#x201C;We can&#x2019;t do without imports for now,&#x201D; the chairman summarized. Another document the Kyiv Independent found in the correspondence also illustrates Zala Group&apos;s dependence on imports. The document is a 2019 Microsoft Word file titled &#x201C;List of electronic components.&#x201D; It apparently refers to the electronic components that Zala Aero Group was using or was going to use in the production of its drones back then. The document lists 24 components manufactured by Keysight Technologies, a U.S. company. Five years later, the Lancet drones still use foreign parts of mixed origin. Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence agency, known in Ukraine as HUR, maintains a public register of foreign components discovered in captured Russian weapons and military equipment. It includes a list of components found in three Lancet models that were downed in Ukraine. Among them, there are no components from Keysight Technologies. But there are products from many others. The Lancets had components from a number of American companies: Nvidia, National Semiconductor, Microchip Technology, Micron Technology, Xilinx, Texas Instruments, Atmel Corporation, Analog Devices, Qorvo, Maxim Integrated Products, Bel Fuse, and Semtech Corporation. There were also components from other countries: Swiss companies STMicroelectronics, U-blox, and TE Connectivity; the German company Infineon Technologies; Dutch companies NXP Semiconductors and Skoopia; and South Korea&#x2019;s Ricci Microwave and SK Hynix, and others. Some of the components remained unidentified, their origin unknown. Among the imported components required by Zala Aero, one will find chips, microprocessors, cameras, video encoders and decoders, microcontrollers, transceivers, resistors, transistors, and batteries. A screenshot from the website, run by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence, that lists some of the components found in a Russian Lancet drone in Ukraine. (War-sanctions.gur.gov.ua)So the question is: How did Zala Aero Group, so dependent on imported components, manage to increase drone production despite the sanctions and export restrictions that were meant to stop the flow of microelectronics and machine tools into Russia? Following the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war, a number of countries imposed export controls, prohibiting the sale of microelectronics, motors, and machine tools to Russia. Instead of getting the necessary supplies from America or Europe, Russian producers now buy them from third countries. Russia&#x2019;s biggest helper here is China. This country makes up for Russia&apos;s deficit both with its own production and as a distributor of foreign manufacturers. China has become the lifeline of the Zala Aero Group. We have studied the import data of several Zala Aero Group companies in 2022-2024, received with the help of OCCRP, an international investigative journalism group. We identified the two companies that imported foreign parts for Zala Aero&#x2019;s drone production &#x2014; OMP and Spetstechnotrade. The two companies have different owners than the rest of the group. One was founded by a Zala Aero employee and another &#x2014; by an employee&#x2019;s father. The ownership structure appears to be an attempt to safeguard the companies from a direct association with military production, which could have complicated foreign trade for them. These two companies are suppliers to Zala Aero&#x2019;s two main drone manufacturers &#x2014; Aeroscan and CST, according to Russian Tax Service data. The import records indicate they have purchased goods from a number of Chinese and Hong Kong suppliers: Jiangxi Xintuo Enterprise, Bestop Globle MFG, Star Rapid Manufacturing, Microblock technology, Gpcomm technology, and M-Function investment management. Chinese and Hong Kong partners supplied Zala Aero&#x2019;s companies with motors, electrical conductors, carbon fiber products, aluminum alloy frames, and aluminum products worth millions of dollars. These components are used in drone production. Some of these Chinese and Hong Kong entities are listed in customs databases not only as sellers but also as manufacturers of the sold products, including motors. The Kyiv Independent sent out inquiries to several Chinese and Hong Kong companies selling components to Zala Aero Group, asking about the products they sell ending up in Russian drone production during the war. Other companies from the list of suppliers have no public representation or contact details. One of the suppliers, Star Rapid Manufacturing, responded. According to their reply, the Russian company OMP misinformed the company, claiming its business activities were not related to military production. &#x201C;At the time of our dealings, OMP presented itself as an independent entity, and OMP confirmed that the parts were not related to military equipment,&#x201D; wrote the company. &#x201C;Upon becoming aware of OMP&#x2019;s association with Zala Aero Group, which we were previously not aware of, and their inclusion in sanctions, we promptly ended our business relationship with OMP.&#x201D; Sanctions against the Zakharov family and Zala Aero Group companies. (The Kyiv Independent)But the two affiliated companies, OMP and Spetstechnotrade, don&#x2019;t cover all of Zala Aero&#x2019;s needs for imported components. Zala Aero also uses other, unaffiliated external Russian suppliers. These Russian intermediaries import and resell components, both Western and Asian-made. One of them is a Moscow-based supplier named Online Trade. In 2024, this company repeatedly sold goods to several entities of Zala Aero Group: CST, Aeroscan, and Spetstechnotrade. Evidence of these deals is found in the leaked data of the Russian Tax Office. The data doesn&#x2019;t specify which items Online Trade supplies to Zala Aero, but the import database shows that Online Trade has been bringing large volumes of video cameras and lenses, as well as microelectronics, to Russia. The Russian company bought the cameras from a number of companies, including the Hong Kong-based companies Angco International Trading and Union Camera Hong Kong. They are distributors, not producers: They resell cameras, including Western-made ones. Its chains like that &#x2014; a Hong Kong reseller, a Russian broker, and finally a Russian drone manufacturer &#x2014; that put a Western-made camera inside a drone that hunts down Western-donated equipment on the battlefield in Ukraine. Online Trade is not the only Russian intermediary reselling imported components to Zala Aero Group. Other Russian companies also supplied it with items in 2024: Chip and Dip, Hartis DV, Raidecs, San Susi, Fotopark, and others. Among the Hartis DV suppliers was a Hong Kong company Izzition E-Technology which calls itself a distributor of Western brands like NXP, Altera, and Xilinx. The NXP and Xilinx products were found in Russian Lancets downed in Ukraine. For details about the import procurement of Zala Aero&#x2019;s Russian suppliers, see the following chart: Supply chains of some of the imported components for Zala Aero. (The Kyiv Independent)Sanctions against the suppliers of Zala Aero Group and its intermediaries. (The Kyiv Independent)The China problemChina has become a convenient back door for Russian companies in need of the goods that fall under export restrictions, imposed by a number of countries to deprive Russian military production of key components. Before selling sensitive goods to China, companies from those countries have to check that they will not be heading to Russia. In reality, often, only the &#x201C;first-tier&#x201D; buyer ends up checked, and not the end consumer to whom goods will be resold. In an effort to publicly distance itself from Russia&#x2019;s, China promised to tighten restrictions on the supply of drones and components to Russia. But experts are somewhat skeptical about the actual impact of these statements, given previous experience. &#x201C;China has proven itself unwilling to strictly enforce export restrictions on electronic goods, especially those produced by Western firms, from going to Russia,&#x201D; Spencer Faragasso, a senior research fellow with the Institute for Science and International Security (U.S.), told the Kyiv Independent. China has positioned itself as neutral in the ongoing war but has been supplying Russia with materials that directly boost its war machine, receiving military technology support from Russia in return, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said recently. &#x201C;The sanctions coalition countries have three options for responding to China&apos;s role in supporting Russia&apos;s military machine,&#x201D; says Agiya Zagrebelska, the Ukrainian sanctions expert. &#x201D;The first is to escalate economic restrictions with China. But let&apos;s be honest, no one is ready to take this step, because China is too big a market. The second option is to leave everything as it is. And the third is what we are proposing: the implementation of real penalties against component and machine tool manufacturers (in the form of) investigations and fines.&#x201D; Zagrebelska says that manufacturers pay attention only to the first buyer in the chain because no one punishes them for turning a blind eye to where the goods end up. &#x201C;We call it willful blindness. We are convinced that with all the modern capabilities of big data and artificial intelligence, a manufacturer is able to identify risky buyers by their typical characteristics,&#x201D; says Zagrebelska. A similar idea of fines for Western producers combined with government support to move their plants outside of China has also been proposed by the American Institute for Science and International Security. &#x201C;The unfortunate reality is that Western electronics companies, particularly those based in the U.S., have not done enough. They can legitimately be accused of helping to arm Russia in its bloody attacks on Ukraine,&#x201D; the Institute writes in a recent report. &#x201C;Western countries are supplying Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars worth of military equipment to defend Ukraine from Russian weapons that could not function without Western electronic goods. Halting the flow of these items can have a meaningful impact on Russia&#x2019;s ability to field its weapons against Ukraine.&#x201D; The owners of Zala Aero Group, Aleksandr Zakharov and his family, are among the main beneficiaries of the Russian war&#x2019;s insatiable hunger for drones. In the first quarter of 2024 alone, Aeroscan, a company part of the Zala Aero Group, earned nearly $90 million by supplying the Russian Defense Ministry, military units, and the logistics center of Russia&#x2019;s National Guard with products, according to Russian Tax Service leaked data. The leaked emails of Zala Aero&apos;s employees allow us to map out the roles that members of the Zakharov family play in the business. The elder Zakharov is the main owner and chief designer of Zala Aero. His son Nikita Zakharov is the founder of several Zala Aero Group companies, mostly involved in software development. Recently, the Russian tax authorities closed public access to the data on the founders and managers of the companies created by Nikita Zakharov in the Russian company register. This is done for companies that perform state defense contracts or are under international sanctions. Zala Aero founder Aleksandr Zakharov with Russian President Vladimir Putin in an undated photograph. (Kommersant)Aleksandr Zakharov&apos;s son Nikita Zakharov, co-owner of Zala Aero, with Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia&apos;s Security Council, in an undated photo. (Russian Research and Development Institute of Robotics and Control System)Aleksandr Zakharov&apos;s wife Svetlana (L), daughter Maria (R). (Social media)The father and the son appear to be the brains behind Zala Aero Group. In the email leak available to us, there is a document called &#x201C;Structure.&#x201D; It contains a list of employees of the entire group as of February 2021. Some of the employees are marked as supervised by Aleksandr Zakharov, others are supervised by his son Nikita. It marks employees as subordinated to AV, which it explains stands for Aleksandr Vladislavovich Zakharov, or NZ, for Nikita Zakharov. Zakharov&apos;s wife Svetlana is in charge of the administrative side of the business, including renting production facilities. Their daughter Maria is the founder of several software development and research companies that until recently were part of the group, but that are now being dissolved. Until recently, Zakharov&apos;s younger son Lavrentii was not publicly listed among the founders of any Russian companies. He resided in Europe and attended a London university, occasionally visiting Russia. However, our documents show that he was involved in his Russian family&#x2019;s business even while studying in London. The leaked correspondence contains his reports on the flaws in the TiEn unmanned flight simulator, another development of the Zala Aero Group, which he apparently tested. The reports date back to July 2019, when Lavrentii Zakharov was 20 years old. At the time, he was studying at University College London and was a member of the UCL Eurasian Business Society, an organization that unites the Russian-speaking community in London. At the same time, he managed to test a drone simulator developed by his family&#x2019;s company. Lavrentii Zakharov seen in a group photo posted by the Instagram account of the UCL Eurasian Business Society on Nov. 22, 2018. (UCLEBS/Instagram)Lavrentii&#x2019;s European life was marred in the summer of 2023, when independent Russian investigative outlet iStories revealed that the son of the Russian drone tycoon had interned at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Affairs in Geneva. The story also found that the Zakharov family owned an apartment in central London worth 1.5 million pounds. The investigation also revealed that none of the family members were under personal international sanctions at the time, despite their business&#x2019;s role in Russia&#x2019;s war effort. After the story ran, the Zakharovs were sanctioned by the U.K. and the U.S., which means that their assets in these countries should be frozen. The UN Institute has removed the page that mentioned Lavrentii Zakharov&apos;s internship. He has the internship marked as completed in September 2023 on his LinkedIn page. Lavrentii Zakharov seen in group photos taken at the United Nations offices in Geneva in June 2023. (ibei.org)London building where the Zakharov family bought their apartment in 2018. (Google Maps)Alleged view of the apartment apartment at 47 Marsham Street, London, UK.&#xA0;The EU and other Western and non-Western countries haven&#x2019;t imposed personal sanctions on the Zakharovs yet. Our investigation shows that after the scandal, the youngest Zakharov apparently returned to Russia. In December 2023, Lavrentii Zakharov founded his own company in Moscow called Zakharov and Grek Technical Bureau, a technology consulting firm. And in 2024, we spotted him in a photo with Russian model Natalia Kozyreva, taken in Moscow, apparently on her birthday. Lavrentii Zakharov with Russian model Natalia Kozyreva in Moscow in 2024. A Google Street View screenshot from the same location confirms the photo was taken in Moscow. (Instagram, Google Maps)The sanctions seem to have brought the entire Zakharov family to Russia. This is where their effect has been exhausted, for now. But this does not mean that the channels that feed the Russian military machine can&#x2019;t be cut off. Western suppliers could stop selling critical components to Chinese intermediaries that resell them to Russia. Chinese companies could also adhere to their government&apos;s stated policy of not selling drones and components to the aggressor. Together, these steps would deprive Russia of some of the key weapons it uses to wage its war in Ukraine. Hey! This is Alisa Yurchenko, I wrote this story. Thank you for reading this far, it was a long one to get through. It&#x2019;s upsetting that the Russian manufacturer at the center of the story can still produce weapons that attack Ukraine, even though Russia doesn&#x2019;t make critical components for them domestically. But I&apos;m glad that I was able to demonstrate how the manufacturer imports the components from abroad. I hope this will draw attention to the problem, which is actually much broader than a single drone manufacturer. This by no means signals that sanctions are useless. On the opposite: The story shows how dependent Russian manufacturers are on imported components, and how vulnerable they really are to trade limitations. It means that if sanctions and exports controls are improved, and enforced, they have real potential of severely undermining Russia&#x2019;s war effort.

US imposes sanctions on over 50 Russian banks, including Gazprombank	The U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on dozens of Russian banks, including Gazprombank, securities registrars, and financial officials, according to a Nov. 21 statement. The U.K. and Canada sanctioned Gazprombank during the first weeks of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. The U.S., however, had previously avoided strict measures against the bank. &quot;Today&apos;s sanctions targeting Russia&apos;s largest remaining non-designated bank, as well as dozens of other financial institutions and officials in Russia, will further diminish and degrade Russia&apos;s war machine,&quot; U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. The U.S. had refrained from targeting Gazprombank to allow European countries to continue paying for Russian gas supplies, as the bank is the primary channel for energy-related payments, Financial Times reported. &quot;This sweeping action will make it harder for the Kremlin to evade U.S. sanctions and fund and equip its military.&quot; The outlet also noted that Russia used Gazprombank to purchase military equipment, pay soldiers, and compensate the families of those killed in the war in Ukraine. The new U.S. sanctions will close one of Russia&apos;s few remaining avenues for international banking, barring Gazprombank from conducting transactions in dollars. In addition to Gazprombank, the U.S. Treasury Department&apos;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has sanctioned over 50 Russian banks connected to the international financial system, more than 40 securities registrars, and 15 financial officials. OFAC also issued an alert detailing the sanctions risks associated with Russia&#x2019;s financial messaging system, which the Kremlin is using to evade existing restrictions.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-imposes-sanctions-on-over-50-russian-banks-including-gazprombank/	2024-11-21T10:50:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1258690185.jpg

Russia used intermediate-range ballistic missile against Ukraine, Putin says	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated Russia tested its new intermediate-range ballistic missile, the Oreshnik, in a strike on Dnipro on Nov. 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin said. Russian forces launched a missile attack on the city earlier in the day, reportedly using a conventional intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Ukrainian authorities have not confirmed the type of missile used in the strike. Putin claimed Ukraine targeted facilities in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk and Bryansk oblasts with long-range ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles on Nov. 19 and 20. In response, Russian forces launched a combined attack on a defense industry facility in Dnipro, according to the Russian president. The Oreshnik missile is designed to carry nuclear weapons. However, Putin said it was not armed with a nuclear warhead in this instance.Putin also warned that Russia would use weapons against any country whose arms are used to strike Russian targets.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-used-intermediate-range-ballistic-missile-against-ukraine-putin-says/	2024-11-21T10:00:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1246327671.jpg
Russian FM spokesperson asked not to comment on ballistic missile strike on Ukraine during briefing	Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova received a call during her Nov. 21 press briefing instructing her not to comment on the latest ballistic missile attacks on Ukraine. Zakharova gave the briefing following a Russian missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro earlier that day, allegedly involving an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). If confirmed, it would mark the first use of an ICBM in war, a weapon primarily designed for long-range nuclear strikes. During the briefing, Zakharova stood near the microphone, allowing a man&apos;s voice on the phone to be heard saying: &quot;Masha, our strikes with ballistic missiles, which we did not talk about , are not commented on at all.&quot; Zakharova replied, &quot;Yes, thank you.&quot; Zakharova stood near the microphone, so an unnamed man on the phone could be heard telling her: &quot;Masha, our ballistic missile strikes, which we didn&apos;t talk about, we don&apos;t comment on at all.&quot; Zakharova replied: &quot;Yes, thank you.&quot; A recording of the exchange has circulated online and through various media outlets. Zakharova later told Russia&apos;s state-owned TASS news agency that the call was to &quot;clarify whether the Foreign Ministry could comment on the topic.&quot; She added, &quot;The answer was received during the briefing &#x2014; the Foreign Ministry does not comment. So, there is no intrigue.&quot; Russia allegedly used the Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile, capable of carrying nuclear warheads, during the Nov. 21 attack, Ukrainian broadcaster Suspilne reported, citing unnamed law enforcement sources. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the report. President Volodymyr Zelensky said an investigation is ongoing but noted that the missile&apos;s &quot;speed and altitude suggest intercontinental ballistic capabilities.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-fm-spokesperson-asked-not-to-comment-on-ballistic-missile-strike-on-ukraine-during-briefing/	2024-11-21T08:57:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1237721878.jpg

Ukraine first country to face intercontinental ballistic missile use, Ukraine's Stratcom agency claims	Ukraine is the first country in the world against which an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) has been used, Ukraine&apos;s Center for Strategic Communications (Stratcom) said on Nov. 21. &quot;We will do everything to ensure that Russia is remembered in history only for its crimes,&quot; Stratcom said in a statement. Russian forces launched a missile attack on the city of Dnipro earlier in the day, allegedly using a conventional ICBM. The attack injured two people. If Russia did use an ICBM against Ukraine, it would be the first use in war of a weapon designed to deliver long-range nuclear strikes. The missile was launched from Astrakhan Oblast, a Russian region 740 kilometers (460 miles) from Dnipro, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. The attack damaged an industrial enterprise, two houses, and nine garages and caused two fires, said Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Governor Serhii Lysak. A rehabilitation center for people with disabilities was also damaged, Mayor Borys Filatov said. Russia allegedly used the Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile, which is capable of carrying nuclear warheads, Ukrainian broadcaster Suspilne reported, citing unidentified law enforcement sources. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the report. President Volodymyr Zelensky said an investigation is ongoing but noted that the missile&apos;s &quot;speed and altitude suggest intercontinental ballistic capabilities.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s clear that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is using Ukraine as a testing ground. It&apos;s also clear that he is terrified of normal life next to him. A life where people live with dignity,&quot; Zelensky said on the occasion of Ukraine&apos;s Day of Dignity and Freedom, commemorating the Orange Revolution in 2004 and the EuroMaidan Revolution in 2013-14.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-first-country-to-face-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-use-ukraines-stratcom-agency-claims/	2024-11-21T07:11:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-21_10-53-05--2-.jpg
Nikki Haley slams Trump's top intelligence pick Gabbard, calls her 'Russian sympathizer'	U.S. Republican politician Nikki Haley on Nov. 20 criticized Tulsi Gabbard, Donald Trump&apos;s nominee for the director of national intelligence, for her foreign policy stances, including her favorable positions towards Russia and other authoritarian regimes. Gabbard&#x2019;s nomination comes as part of Trump&#x2019;s proposed cabinet, a choice that has sparked concern in Kyiv due to the former Hawaii congresswoman&apos;s Ukraine-skeptic views. Speaking on her podcast Nikki Haley Live, the ex-South South Carolina governor slammed Gabbard&#x2019;s past statements and actions, particularly her criticism of NATO and her remarks about Russia&#x2019;s &quot;legitimate security concerns&quot; regarding Ukraine&#x2019;s potential NATO membership. &quot;After Russia invaded Ukraine, Tulsi Gabbard literally blamed NATO, our Western alliance that&#x2019;s responsible for countering Russia,&quot; said Haley, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination before conceding to Trump. &quot;She blamed NATO for the attack on Ukraine, and the Russians and the Chinese echoed her talking points and her interviews on Russian and Chinese television.&quot; When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Gabbard posted the video of her Fox News comments about U.S. sanctions against Russia on Twitter (now X) and suggested that &quot;doing anything to press Putin to stop the invasion of Ukraine could lead to a nuclear war.&quot; Gabbard also argued that the eastward expansion of NATO had provoked Moscow and claimed that the U.S. was fueling a proxy war with Russia that could lead to a &quot;forever war.&quot; A former congresswoman from Hawaii and Iraq War veteran, Gabbard has faced longstanding scrutiny for her foreign policy views. Haley also criticized Gabbard&#x2019;s broader foreign policy record, highlighting her 2017 meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which she called disgusting.&quot; She also questioned Gabbard&#x2019;s ability to handle national security responsibilities, accusing her of being &quot;overly sympathetic&quot; to authoritarian regimes. &quot;This is not a place for a Russian, Iranian, Syrian, or Chinese sympathizer,&quot; Haley said. She also added that Gabbard has consistently failed to denounce her controversial positions. Neither Gabbard nor her team has responded to Haley&#x2019;s comments.	https://kyivindependent.com/haley-gabbard/	2024-11-21T06:22:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182701925.jpg
Russian ICBM strike would be 'clear escalation,' EU says	Russia using an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) against Ukraine would be a &quot;clear escalation&quot; by Moscow, EU foreign affairs spokesperson Peter Stano told reporters on Nov. 21 after Kyiv said Russian forces deployed the weapon. &quot;While we&apos;re assessing the full facts, it&apos;s obvious that such (an) attack would mark yet another clear escalation from the side of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,&quot; Stano said, according to AFP. The Ukrainian Air Force said that Russia launched nine missiles, including a conventional ICBM, against the central-eastern city of Dnipro on the morning of Nov. 21, injuring at least two people and damaging several buildings. President Volodymyr Zelensky later clarified that the investigation is ongoing but that the missile&apos;s &quot;speed and altitude suggest intercontinental ballistic capabilities.&quot; If confirmed, it would mark the first occasion of Russia deploying an ICBM in the war against Ukraine, coming shortly after the U.S. permitted Ukraine to carry out strikes in Russia with Western long-range missiles and after Russia updated its nuclear deterrence policy. While an undisclosed Ukrainian official told ABC News that Ukraine was &quot;95%&quot; certain Russia deployed an ICBM, a Western official quoted by the news outlet disputed the claim, saying it resembled a regular ballistic missile. It remains unclear what type of ICBM was reportedly deployed. The missile was launched from Astrakhan Oblast in southern Russia, over 700 kilometers (435 miles) east of Dnipro. Russia has not immediately commented. In a video clip widely shared in the media, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova received a phone call during a press conference apparently asking her not to comment on reports about &quot;ballistic missile strikes.&quot; Zakharova later claimed she was merely asking &quot;experts whether this was our topic,&quot; and the &quot;answer came during the briefing: the Foreign Ministry does not comment. There is no conspiracy.&quot; If the use of such a weapon is confirmed, it would mark &quot;quantitative and qualitative change&quot; in the war, according to Stano. According to the spokesperson, Russia is &quot;playing a nuclear gamble. Whether they really mean it, it&apos;s very hard to foresee.&quot; &quot;We only know that this is irresponsible and this constitutes a global threat,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-russia-icbm/	2024-11-21T05:44:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1205267788.jpeg
Ukraine '95% ready' to resume flights but needs adequate air defenses, minister says	Ukraine is &quot;95%&quot; ready to resume commercial flights, but the key remaining factor is to ensure the safety of passengers, Communities and Territories Development Minister Oleksii Kuleba said on Nov. 21. Speaking with the &#xA0;Suspilne broadcaster, the minister said: &quot;The security architecture requires very serious air defenses... so when we have enough air defense for this or that airport, we will be able to talk about it. Unfortunately, today it is impractical.&quot; Ukraine closed its sky for civilian aviation at the start of martial law and the full-scale invasion in 2022, but some recent statements suggest the country could restart commercial flights as early as next year. When asked if it is possible to hope for the opening of air traffic in 2025, Kuleba said that it will depend on the situation on the front. &quot;Of course, we can hope. But if we are realistic, then in principle, we can only talk about it with respect to the front-line situation. As with all other issues concerning the development of our country: first the front, then anything else,&quot; Kuleba said. Crispin Ellison, a senior partner at the Marsh McLennan insurance and risk management firm, said on Nov. 7 that at least one of Ukraine&apos;s airports, either in Lviv or Boryspil near Kyiv, could resume operations by the end of January 2025. &quot;Opening Lviv is the beginning of a journey to opening up Boryspil,&quot; Ellison told a Kyiv Independent reporter at the Kyiv International Economic Forum. &quot;What we need is a confirmation around the (air) defenses and the military situation, which allows regulatory sign-off,&quot; Ellison added. Under favorable circumstances, according to Ellison, five or six airlines could agree to operate flights from Ukraine in January. Lviv lies in the western part of the country. While it has suffered a number of deadly attacks during the full-scale war, it has been targeted considerably less often than other major cities like Kyiv, Kharkiv, or Odesa. Ukrinform reported that insurance companies are ready for political decisions on the resumption of air traffic with Ukraine. At the end of October, Ukraine presented a roadmap for the partial reopening of its airspace under martial law, outlining a step-by-step plan and requirements. International airlines, including LOT Polish Airlines, SkyUp Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Wizz Air, and others, also joined the discussion on opening airspace in Ukraine during martial law.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-flights/	2024-11-21T05:03:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-973341882.jpg
Putin is using Ukraine as training ground,' Zelensky says after reported ICBM strike	Russia&apos;s apparent deployment of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) against Dnipro on Nov. 21 shows that Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;is using Ukraine as his training ground,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said. &quot;Today (on Nov. 21), there was a new Russian missile. All its features &#x2013; speed, altitude &#x2013; show it was an intercontinental ballistic missile. An analysis is underway,&quot; Zelensky said in a video address on his Telegram channel. Russian forces launched the conventional ICBM, along with seven cruise missiles and a Kinzhal ballistic missile, against the central-eastern city of Dnipro on the morning of Nov. 21, the Air Force reported earlier. At least two people were injured, and several buildings, including a rehabilitation center for people with disabilities, were damaged. The Air Force reported downing six of the cruise missiles. This would mark the first occasion of Russia deploying an ICBM in the war against Ukraine, coming shortly after the U.S. permitted Ukraine to carry out strikes in Russia with Western long-range missiles and Russia updated its nuclear deterrence policy. It remains unclear what type of ICBM was launched. The missile was launched from Astrakhan Oblast in southern Russia, over 700 kilometers (435 miles) east of Dnipro. &quot;We can see that Putin is using Ukraine as a training ground. We can see that he is afraid when people lead a normal life. When people have dignity,&quot; Zelensky said on the occasion of Ukraine&apos;s Day of Dignity and Freedom, commemorating the Orange Revolution in 2004 and the EuroMaidan Revolution in 2013-14. Ukraine&apos;s head of state reminded that Moscow seeks to obtain new missiles around the world, namely from North Korea and Iran. &quot;Putin is doing everything he can to prevent his neighbor from slipping out of his hands. And I thank all Ukrainian men, all Ukrainian women who protect Ukraine from this evil - steadfastly, bravely, firmly,&quot; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-icbm/	2024-11-21T04:14:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2176416230-1.jpg
Merkel describes Trump as 'fascinated by Putin' in her memoir	Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel described Donald Trump as &quot;fascinated by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&quot; and &quot;by other authoritarian leaders,&quot; with a &quot;winner-or-loser mentality&quot; in excerpts from her new memoir published by Die Zeit on Nov. 21. Trump&apos;s relationship with Putin is coming into the spotlight as the former U.S. president is set to return to the White House in January, with far-ranging implications for Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. &quot;(Trump) saw everything from the point of view of a property developer, which is what he was before he came into politics. Every plot of land could only be sold once, and if he didn&apos;t get it, someone else would. That&apos;s how he saw the world,&quot; writes the former German politician in the book titled &quot;Freedom: Memories 1954-2021.&quot; &quot;Donald Trump asked me a series of questions, including about my East German origins and my relationship with Putin,&quot; she said. &quot;He was clearly fascinated by the Russian president.&quot; These assertions seem to align with what the U.S. president-elect, who had already sat in the Oval Office between 2017 and 2021, has shown so far. At the Helsinki summit in 2018, Trump went so far as to say publicly that he was prepared to trust the word of this dictator over his own intelligence services. During his time out of office, after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Trump again praised Putin for his audacity, and he told a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago, Florida, that &quot;Putin is pretty smart,&quot; calling him a &quot;genius&quot; and &quot;savvy,&quot; as reported by Bloomberg. Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward reported that Trump spoke to Putin &quot;as many as seven times&quot; after he left the presidency and that at one point in 2024, Trump told a senior aide to leave the room at his mansion in Mar-a-Lago so &quot;he could have what he said was a private phone call&quot; with the Russian leader. Trump also said he could end the war in a day, something widely taken to mean he would force President Volodymyr Zelensky to make painful territorial concessions. Similarly, Putin has made positive comments about Trump recently. Commenting on the attempted assassination of Trump while he was speaking at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania in July, Reuters reported Putin saying: &quot;He behaved, in my opinion, in a very correct way, courageously, like a real man.&quot; After his election, the Washington Post reported on Nov. 10 that Trump had a direct phone call with Putin, in which Trump allegedly advised Putin not to escalate the situation in Ukraine. The Kremlin denied that the call ever took place. On Nov. 20, Reuters reported that Putin was willing to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine with Donald Trump, citing five former and current Russian officials. Trump is a person &quot;under the spell of politicians with autocratic and dictatorial tendencies,&quot; Merkel described. The same tendency was supported by Politico, which described the U.S. president-elect as &quot;heaping praise on leaders who have praised him and gotten along with him in the past, or who he sees as strong figures on the world stage.&quot; In Trump&apos;s eyes, Putin probably possessed these qualities, as Merkel described him as &quot;a man who does not want to be disrespected and who is ready to pounce at any moment.&quot; Merkel also says Putin is determined to ensure that &quot;Russia will never disappear from the world map,&quot; a stance that would presumably embody Trump&apos;s vision of a &quot;strong figure on the world stage.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/merkel-trump-putin/	2024-11-21T03:40:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1060146212.jpg
Parliament passes bill allowing first-time deserters to return to military service	Ukraine&apos;s parliament passed a bill on Nov. 21 that will enable soldiers who deserted or were absent without leave (AWOL) for the first time to return and continue serving in the military. The contracts of these soldiers will continue to be valid if they voluntarily decide to return to their units. The bill comes amid broader legislative changes pertaining to draft and military service as Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces seek to replenish their ranks amid a grueling war with Russia. The legislation, supported by 253 lawmakers, will also ensure that the provision of relevant payments, social security, and other benefits to the soldiers resumes. The parliament previously decriminalized the first instances of desertion or going AWOL in August, provided the soldiers returned to their units. Earlier this month, the 53rd and the 57th mechanized brigades called on soldiers who left their units to return, saying that the &quot;door is open.&quot; &quot;We can all make mistakes - it&apos;s part of life. It&apos;s important to remember that one mistake does not define us completely,&quot; the statement of the 53rd Brigade read. &quot;We have one country, one goal, and we can only win together.&quot; Although Ukraine adopted a major bill reforming the draft in April, the mobilization draft slowed down in autumn, leaving many front-line units undermanned in the face of more numerous Russian troops. A further 160,000 people are to be drafted into the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which will raise the manning of units to 85%, National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksandr Lytvynenko said on Oct. 29.	https://kyivindependent.com/parliament-passes-bill-allowing-first-time-deserters-return-to-military-service/	2024-11-21T03:17:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1643784971.jpg
Ukrainian UAVs reportedly strike Russian border regions, industrial facility hit	Russian authorities reported Ukrainian drone strikes against the border regions of Rostov and Voronezh on Nov. 21, claiming that an industrial facility had been hit. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed that its forces intercepted two drones over the two regions, making no mention of possible damage or whether some of the drones slipped through the defenses. Yuri Slyusar, the acting governor of Rostov Oblast, said on his Telegram channel that a fire broke out at an industrial facility in the central Konstantinovsky district because of a &quot;drone crash.&quot; Slyusar claimed that firefighters quickly extinguished the fire. The type of the facility and the full extent of damage were not specified. Another drone was reportedly downed in Rostov Oblast&apos;s Myasnikovsky district, inflicting no damage. No casualties were reported. The airport in the city of Volgograd, lying northeast of Rostov Oblast, temporarily suspended operations due to safety concerns, the Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) reported. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all of the claims. Kyiv launches regular drone strikes against Russian territory, targeting military and industrial facilities to undermine Russia&apos;s war effort in Ukraine. Two industrial facilities &#x2013; including a factory producing cargo drones for the Russian military &#x2013; and a military arsenal were allegedly hit during drone attacks overnight on Nov. 20.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-uavs-reportedly-strike-russian-border-regions/	2024-11-21T02:37:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1690787546.jpg
Hungary deploys air defenses near Ukraine, cites war escalation after US allows strikes in Russia	Hungary is deploying air defense systems near the Ukrainian border, citing increased risks after the West allowed the use of long-range weapons inside Russian territory, Defense Minister Kristof Szalay-Bobrovniczky said on Nov. 20. The minister ordered the deployment of air defense systems in the country&apos;s northeastern regions, saying that &quot;the war has entered its most dangerous phase.&quot; Szalay-Bobrovniczky attributed this escalation namely to the easing of restrictions on Ukrainian strikes with Western arms and linked it to Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s approval of an updated nuclear doctrine. This decision comes after two Russian missiles were shot down on Nov. 17 in Zakarpattia Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s westernmost region bordering Hungary and home to an estimated 75,000 ethnic Hungarians. On that occasion, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that it was necessary to &quot;strengthen efforts to bring peace&quot; as &quot;each day brings with it the risk of escalating war.&quot; Budapest has consistently criticized and obstructed Western military support for Ukraine, claiming it would lead to an escalation, and has maintained warm ties with Moscow throughout the full-scale war. Previously, Russian drones and missiles launched during strikes on Ukraine have crossed into the airspace of other countries, namely Poland, Latvia, Romania, Moldova, and Belarus. The latest development in Hungary follows a series of increasingly strong resolutions by Ukraine&apos;s Western allies. After U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken pledged that the Biden administration would bolster support for Kyiv before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, President Joe Biden on Nov. 17 allowed Ukraine to use ATACMS missiles to strike deep inside Russian territory. Ukraine reportedly used ATACMS missiles to strike a Russian military arsenal in Bryansk Oblast on Nov. 19 and allegedly also used U.K.-supplied Storm Shadow on Nov. 20, marking the first instance of these weapons being used on Russian soil. Other Western allies have expressed their position on their own supplied weapons. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Nov. 18 that Paris &quot;remained open&quot; to allowing Ukraine to use French long-range missiles to strike military targets inside Russia, reported Le Monde. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said that she &quot;understands&quot; the U.S. response to Russia, but Rome makes a &quot;different choice&quot; and focuses on air defenses for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-deploys-air-defenses-near-ukraine/	2024-11-21T02:14:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1228238620.jpg
Russian attack on Kryvyi Rih injures 2, damages residential buildings	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched an attack against the city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast on Nov. 21, injuring at least two people, officials said. A 32-year-old man and a 24-year-old woman have been hospitalized and are in condition of moderate severity, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. An administrative building and two two-story residential buildings were damaged. The attack comes on the same day after Russia launched a large-scale missile attack against Dnipro, the regional center of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. According to the Air Force, Russia launched nine missiles against the city, including an intercontinental ballistic missile. This would mark the first time such a weapon was deployed in the war against Ukraine. Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of President Volodymyr Zelensky, remains a frequent target of Russia&apos;s missile attacks. With a population of around 660,000, it is the second-largest city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. The city lies about 70 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of the nearest front-line zone.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-kryvyi-rih/	2024-11-21T01:13:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1221388130.jpg
Russia reportedly launches intercontinental ballistic missile against Ukraine — what we know so far	Editor&apos;s note: This is a breaking story and will be updated regularly. Russia launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) against Dnipro, east Ukraine on the morning of Nov. 21, Kyiv&apos;s Air Force reported. If confirmed, it would be the first time the Kremlin has used such a weapon in an attack on Ukraine. In the early hours of Nov. 21, a country-wide air raid alert sounded due to the threat of ballistic missiles, and later, the launch of several Russian Tu-95MS bomber aircraft. According to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force, the attack targeted the city of Dnipro using a number of different missile types. &quot;In particular, an intercontinental ballistic missile was launched from the Astrakhan region of the Russian Federation, an Kh-47M2 &apos;Kinzhal&apos; aeroballistic missile from a MiG-31K fighter jet was launched from the Tambov region, and seven Kh-101 cruise missiles were fired from Tu-95MS strategic bombers,&quot; the report said. The report did not specify what type of ICBM was launched. An industrial enterprise was damaged, and two fires broke out in the city, Governor Serhii Lysak said. A rehabilitation center for people with disabilities was damaged in the attack, Mayor Borys Filatov said. At least two people are reported to have been injured. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force said six of the Kh-101 missiles were reportedly shot down, but did not say if the reported ICBM had caused any of the damage in Dnipro. Russia regularly uses close, and short range ballistic missiles in aerial attacks against Ukraine, but ICBMs are far larger, can be equipped with nuclear payloads, and are designed to hit targets at far longer ranges.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-reportedly-launches-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-against-ukraine-what-we-know-so-far/	2024-11-21T01:09:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/IMG_7583.JPG
Russian troops suspected of executing Ukrainian POWs in Kursk Oblast, ombudsman says	Russian forces are suspected of summarily executing a group of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POW) in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets reported on Nov. 20. Lubinets said that the prisoners were &quot;surrounded&quot; but gave no other details, in particular on the number of victims. Reports of murders, torture, and ill-treatment of Ukrainian POWs are received regularly by Ukrainian authorities and have spiked in recent months. &quot;I have sent letters to the U.N. and the ICRC about this crime,&quot; Lubinets said, reporting the suspected crime on his Telegram channel. &quot;The international community must act immediately. The occupying country has once again violated the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war,&quot; he added. The Armyinform news outlet ties this announcement to a video taken by a drone camera purporting to show the execution. It shows 10 unarmed people lying on the ground with at least five armed men standing over them. &#xA0;At one point, they start shooting at the people on the ground. Heavy fighting has been ongoing in the Russian border region of Kursk since Ukraine launched an offensive there in early August. Earlier the same day, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office announced another shooting of captured Ukrainian military personnel by Russian troops in the Pokrovsk area in Ukraine. Former Prosecutor General Kostin on Oct. 15 called the killing of captured Ukrainian service members in captivity a &quot;deliberate policy of the Russian Federation.&quot; The execution of prisoners of war constitutes a grave violation of the Geneva Convention. Russian forces had executed at least 124 Ukrainian prisoners of war since 2022 as of Nov. 6, authorities said at the time, while the number continues to grow. On top of that, at least 177 Ukrainian prisoners have died in Russian captivity, according to a representative of the Ukrainian Coordination Center for the Treatment of Prisoners of War.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-suspected-of-executing-ukrainian-pows-in-kursk-oblast-ombudsman-says/	2024-11-21T00:51:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1752126648.jpg
Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant faces 2nd blackout of the week after Russian attacks	The Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is on the verge of a blackout after Russian attacks on power lines left the plant connected to only one line, the Energy Ministry reported on Nov. 21. This is the second time this week that the plant has been seriously threatened by a blackout, which could compromise conditions for safe operation and cause an accident. At the moment, the plant is connected to the Ukrainian power grid by only one transmission line. Similar incidents have been reported throughout the full-scale war, with Kyiv accusing Russia of threatening the security of the plant. Russia has occupied the Zaporizhzhia plant, the largest nuclear station in Europe, since March 2022. Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko confirmed that if the last line is cut off, there will be a complete blackout, as reported by the Energy Ministry&apos;s Telegram channel. The Zaporizhzhia plant is not the only one causing concern. The Khmelnytskyi, Rivne, and Southern Ukrainian plants were forced to decrease output on Nov. 17 after a massive Russian aerial strike targeted several substations critical to their power supply. Greenpeace warned that Ukraine&apos;s power grid was at &quot;heightened risk of catastrophic failure&quot; after the mass missile and drone attack targeted the electrical substations. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, confirmed in a statement on Nov. 17 that Ukraine&apos;s nuclear power plants had to reduce their electricity production as a precautionary measure due to large-scale missile attacks. The attacks on Ukraine&#x2019;s infrastructure led to &quot;increased nuclear safety and security risks,&quot; Grossi agreed. Allowing Ukraine to regain control &quot;is the only way to ensure the safe operation of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant,&quot; Halushchenko said.	https://kyivindependent.com/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-faces-2nd-blackout-of-the-week-after-russian-attacks/	2024-11-20T23:57:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1249892066.jpg
Belarusian who fought for Ukraine extradited from Vietnam to Belarus	Vasil Verameichyk, a former soldier of the Kalinouski Regiment fighting on Ukraine&apos;s side, was extradited from Vietnam to Belarus last week, the independent Belarusian outlet Zerkalo reported on Nov. 20. Verameichyk now faces imprisonment, as the Kalinouski Regiment was recently declared a terrorist organization by the Supreme Court of Belarus. The Belarusian regime under dictator Alexander Lukashenko has backed Russia in its aggression against Ukraine and cracked down on Belarusian citizens actively supporting Kyiv. Verameichyk supported the 2020 protests against the electoral fraud in Belarus and then fled to Ukraine. There he joined Kastus Kalinouski&apos;s regiment at the beginning of the full-scale war and fought on the Ukrainian side, according to Ukrainska Pravda. Verameichyk later moved from Ukraine to Lithuania, where he was allegedly denied a residence permit because of his past service in the Belarusian army. According to Belarusian media, he was arrested in Vietnam on Nov. 13 and extradited to Belarus the following day. The Kalinouski Regiment is a military formation within Ukrainian forces, created in March 2022 to protect Ukraine from Russian invasion. It is composed of Belarusian volunteers. In September, another fighter from the regiment who had been held in Russian captivity for two years was charged with mercenarism by Russian proxy authorities in the occupied part of Donetsk Oblast. Following the Supreme Court&apos;s decision, Alexander Karpovich, head of the Belarusian Prosecutor General&apos;s Office, said that members of the regiment had allegedly recruited, armed, and trained &quot;terrorists&quot; and had been involved in financing &quot;terrorist activities.&quot; &quot;On the basis of the provided evidence, the involvement of extremist-minded citizens, who are part of this formation, in the organization, planning, preparation, and commission of acts of terrorism on the territory of the Republic of Belarus was established,&quot; he added. The Belarusian regime brutally suppresses dissent at home, using surveillance, violence, and trumped-up charges with lengthy sentences to intimidate any opposition.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarusian-who-fought-for-ukraine-extradited-from-vietnam-to-belarus/	2024-11-20T23:33:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1473663322--2-.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 3, injure 22 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least three people and injured at least 22 over the past day, including a child, regional authorities reported on Nov. 21. Russian forces launched a large-missile missile early on Nov. 21, reportedly lifting Tu-95 bombers and MiG-31K Kinzhal carriers and attacking the city of Dnipro. According to Telegram monitoring channels, Russian forces attacked the city with ballistic, cruise, and air-launched Kinzhal missiles. An industrial enterprise was damaged, and two fires broke out in the city, Governor Serhii Lysak said. A rehabilitation center for people with disabilities was damaged in the attack, Mayor Borys Filatov said. No casualties were reported at the moment. In Donetsk Oblast, a Russian attack against the village of Pershomarivka killed one person and injured two, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Six people were reportedly injured during an attack against the town of Kostiantynivka. Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast overnight and on Nov. 20 killed one person and injured 10, including a child, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. A 62-year-old woman was also killed during an attack against the Darivka village on the morning of Nov. 21, the governor said. In Kharkiv Oblast, a 64-year-old woman was injured in an attack against the village Vysokyi, and two men aged 42 and 64 were wounded in strikes against the town of Kupiansk, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. A civilian was injured during Russian attacks against the Krasnopillia community in Sumy Oblast, the regional military administration said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-2/	2024-11-20T22:57:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-21_06-37-10.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 727,250 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 727,250 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Nov. 21. This number includes 1,510 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,398 tanks, 19,143 armored fighting vehicles, 29,745 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,731 artillery systems, 1,253 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,003 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 19,259 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-727-250-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-11-20T22:10:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2003914665.jpg
Russia, North Korea agree to increase charter flights following trade discussions, media reports	North Korea and Russia have signed a protocol on cooperation following discussions on trade, the economy, science, and technology, North Korean state media KCNA reported on Nov. 21. While the KCNA report provided few specifics, Russia&#x2019;s state-owned TASS news agency reported that the two countries had agreed to boost charter flights. The agreement was confirmed by Russia&#x2019;s Ministry of Natural Resources, which noted that between January and September, over 5,000 tourists traveled between the two countries, with more than 70% of them flying. North Korea and Russia have significantly strengthened their relations over the past two years, particularly in the context of mutual military support and geopolitical alignment against Western nations, posing significant challenges to international stability. The increased charter flights will operate not only from Russia&#x2019;s eastern regions near North Korea but also from major cities across the country, Russia&apos;s TASS added. The Russian delegation, led by Minister of Natural Resources Alexander Kozlov, met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Nov. 18. During the visit, the Russian government also presented zoo animals, including an African lion and two brown bears, sent from Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin as gifts to North Korea. In April, Russia donated eagles, cranes, and parrots to the Pyongyang Central Zoo, according to Reuters. During Putin&#x2019;s visit to North Korea in June, the leaders agreed on a mutual defense pact. The strengthening of defense relations has raised concerns internationally, with Washington, Kyiv, and Seoul condemning North Korea for supplying military equipment and sending over 10,000 troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-north-korea-agree-to-increase-charter-flights-following-trade-discussions-media-reports/	2024-11-20T19:49:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157649988.jpg
SBU exposes corruption scheme by two Ukrainian army logistics officers	Ukraine&#x2019;s Security Service (SBU) has uncovered a corruption scheme involving two logistics command officers of the Armed Forces, according to a Nov. 20 report. Investigators, working with the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and with support from Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and senior military leaders, found that the suspects signed contracts in 2022 and 2023 to purchase fighter jet spare parts at inflated prices. The investigation revealed that the parts were supplied by a company linked to the officers. To secure the contracts, the suspects allegedly used multiple affiliated commercial entities, some registered abroad, to simulate a competitive bidding process. The scheme is believed to have defrauded the state of Hr 27.3 million ($662,000), which was funneled through a network of shell companies. If convicted, the accused face up to six years in prison. This is not the first investigation by NABU into high-profile corruption. On July 16, then-Prosecutor General Andrii Kostin said that two prosecutors from the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office were under investigation for allegedly accepting a $170,000 bribe to close a criminal case. One of the prosecutors was charged and detained at their workplace following a probe by NABU and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&#x2019;s Office (SAPO).	https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-exposes-corruption-scheme-by-two-ukrainian-army-logistics-officers/	2024-11-20T18:30:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/79903c7fcbd4195421755ad52552f162.jpg
UK defense secretary does not confirm Ukraine's Storm Shadow strike in Russia	U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey on Nov. 20 declined to confirm reports that Ukraine used British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles to strike targets within Russia. &quot;We have seen, over recent weeks, a significant change in the action and in the rhetoric on Ukraine, and Ukraine&apos;s action on the battlefield speaks for itself,&quot; Healey told members of parliament on Nov. 20. &#xA0; Healey&apos;s comments followed reports that Ukraine struck a military facility in Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast with Storm Shadows, marking the first time Kyiv has used the long-range British missiles on Russian soil. Healey did not confirm the reports, but said he had met with Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov the previous day to discuss &quot;Ukraine&apos;s robust response to recent Russian escalations.&quot; Those escalations, Healey said, include Russia&apos;s mass attacks against Ukrainian cities and the deployment of North Korean troops alongside Russian forces in Kursk Oblast. The ministers discussed the U.K.&apos;s plans to continue supporting Ukraine through the end of 2025, Healey said. &quot;(A)t this point, I am not able to go into any further operational details,&quot; he said. The reported Storm Shadow strike came a day after Ukraine allegedly used U.S.-made ATACMS to attack Russian territory for the first time, following outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s approval on Nov. 17. Different versions of Storm Shadow missiles have a range of 250-560 kilometers. Storm Shadows have previously been used to hit Russian military targets in occupied Crimea, a sovereign Ukrainian territory illegally annexed by Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-defense-secretary-does-not-confirm-ukraines-storm-shadow-strike-in-russia/	2024-11-20T16:00:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184908975.jpg
Russian attack in Donetsk Oblast kills 11-year-old boy	Russia attacked a village in Donetsk Oblast on Nov. 20, killing an 11-year-old boy and seriously injuring his 13-year-old sister, regional police reported. A 63-year-old man was also hospitalized with multiple injuries following the attack, police said. Russia launched Tornado multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS) armed with cluster munitions at Pershomaryivka in Donetsk Oblast&apos;s Kramatorsk district at around 3:45 p.m. local time, police reported. The attack struck the yard of a home, instantly killing an 11-year-old boy. His sister, age 13, sustained shrapnel wounds and is in serious condition. She is being treated at a medical facility in Dnipro. A 63-year-old man was also injured and hospitalized. Russian artillery and aerial attacks against Donetsk Oblast settlements are a daily occurrence, regularly resulting in civilian deaths and injuries. The region is also the main target of Russia&apos;s latest offensive push. The district center of Kramatorsk is currently located around 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of the front line.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-in-donetsk-oblast-kills-11-year-old-boy/	2024-11-20T15:13:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/donetsk.jpg
Ukraine to pursue 'diplomatic' liberation of Crimea, will not acknowledge occupied territories as Russian, Zelensky says	Ukraine &quot;cannot legally acknowledge any occupied territory of Ukraine as Russian,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said when asked about ceding land to Russia in exchange for peace during an interview with Fox News published Nov. 20. While Kyiv has consistently rejected territorial concessions as the basis of peace talks, the election of Donald Trump has raised fears that Ukraine may be pushed to the negotiating table under threat of the withdrawal of U.S. aid. Fox News correspondent Trey Yingst asked Zelensky if he would accept loss of territory to Russia as part of a peace deal. &quot;We cannot legally acknowledge any occupied territory of Ukraine as Russian,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;That is about those territories... occupied by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin before the full-scale invasion, since 2014. Legally, we are not acknowledging that, we are not adopting that.&quot; Yingst also asked Zelensky if he would be willing to give up Russian-occupied Crimea, illegally annexed since 2014, in order to &quot;stop the bloodshed in Europe.&quot; Zelensky said Ukraine was prepared to pursue a diplomatic approach to Crimea&apos;s liberation. &quot;I was already mentioning that we are ready to bring Crimea back diplomatically,&quot; he said. &quot;We cannot spend dozens of thousands of our people so that they perish for the sake of Crimea coming back ... We understand that Crimea can be brought back diplomatically.&quot; This is not a new line for Zelensky, who told Reuters in 2022 that Crimea could be returned by diplomatic means.&quot; Following the unveiling of Zelensky&apos;s five-point victory plan for Ukraine this fall, Ukrainian lawmakers also acknowledged that some territories might be returned through diplomacy rather than military means. Republican party strategist Bryan Lanza said on Nov. 9 that Zelensky should accept that &quot;Crimea is gone&quot; ahead of any future peace talks, though the Trump team later distanced itself from Lanza&apos;s comments. Putin said on Nov. 20 that he is willing to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine with Trump, but would not make major territorial concessions and would insist that Kyiv abandon plans to join NATO. Moscow currently holds the advantage on the battlefield in Ukraine, and it is unclear why Russia would choose to pause at its current phase. A growing number of Ukrainians favor a negotiated end to the war, according to a recent Gallup poll. A significant majority of respondents said they would prefer peace talks be brokered by Europe or the U.K. over the U.S. led by Trump.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-pursue-diplomatic-liberation-of-crimea-will-not-acknowledge-occupied-territories-as-russian-zelensky-says/	2024-11-20T14:41:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178140389.jpg
Biden seeks to cancel over $4.5 billion in Ukraine's debt	U.S. President Joe Biden has submitted to Congress a statement of intent to cancel half of Ukraine&apos;s economic aid debt, a sum of around $4.65 billion, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a press briefing on Nov. 20. The supplemental security assistance package worth $61 billion that Congress provided to Ukraine in April included about $10 billion in economic aid as a loan, rather than a grant. The terms of the offer gave Biden the authority to forgive up to 50 percent of the loan. &quot;We have taken the step that was outlined in the law to cancel those loans, provide that economic assistance to Ukraine, and now Congress is welcome to take it up if they wish,&quot; Miller told reporters. Miller said Biden&apos;s statement of intent was delivered to Congress within the last week. While Congress does have the option to overturn the president&apos;s request, Miller said he expected U.S. lawmakers to support the debt cancellation. &quot;I would be surprised if Congress took that step (to overturn the request) given the overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress for providing assistance, but we will follow the law,&quot; he said. With only two months until President-elect Donald Trump takes office, the Biden administration has pledged to shore up support for Kyiv before the presidential transition. Biden has promised to deliver the remaining $6 billion in allocated aid to Ukraine before Trump&apos;s inauguration. He has also approved the delivery of anti-personnel land mines to Ukraine and reportedly authorized Kyiv to strike targets in Russia with long-range ATACMS missiles.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-seeks-to-cancel-over-4-5-billion-in-ukraines-debt/	2024-11-20T13:54:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1850718732.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine reportedly strikes Russia with Storm Shadow missiles for first time	Key developments on Nov. 20: Ukraine has struck targets inside Russia with British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles for the first time, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 20, citing a Western official familiar with the matter. According to the source, the strikes were approved as a response to the presence of North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, a sign of escalation by Russia. Different versions of Storm Shadow missiles have a range of between 250 and 560 kilometers. Storm Shadows have been used to hit Russian military targets in Crimea, a sovereign Ukrainian territory illegally annexed by Russia. The reported strikes come a day after Ukraine reportedly used U.S.-made ATACMS long-range missiles to attack Russian territory, following outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s approval on Nov. 17. That strike reportedly hit a Russian military facility in Karachev, Bryansk Oblast. U.S. President Joe Biden has approved the provision of anti-personnel mines to Ukraine, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Nov. 20. The decision is expected to help slow down Russia&apos;s advance in the east of the country. The move follows the Biden administration&apos;s authorization of the use of U.S.-made long-range missiles to strike Russian territory. Kyiv has not officially confirmed the claims, but recent reports indicate Ukraine deployed U.S. ATACMS missiles in Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast. The transfer of anti-personnel mines could be controversial, as it contradicts the Ottawa Convention, also known as the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Treaty, which has been signed by more than 160 countries. Russia and the U.S. are not signatories to this initiative. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Washington has been supplying Kyiv with anti-tank mines, while Ukrainian forces have been looking for opportunities to obtain infantry mines over the past three years. Moscow has used anti-personnel mines without restriction at the front line, hampering the progress of the Ukrainian military. Biden was reluctant to supply Ukraine with mines due to doubts in his administration and the risk to civilians. Yet Washington is now concerned about Russia&apos;s rapid advance in eastern Ukraine and sees the need to halt it, U.S. officials told the WP. &quot;Russia is attacking Ukrainian lines in the east with waves of troops, regardless of the casualties that they&apos;re suffering,&quot; one of the officials said. &quot;So, the Ukrainians are obviously taking losses, and more towns and cities are at risk of falling. These mines were made specifically to combat exactly this.&quot; One U.S. official described the mines for Ukraine as &quot;non-resistant,&quot; meaning that they self-destruct or lose battery power to render them inactive within days or weeks, reducing the danger to civilians, the WP reported. The official said Kyiv had committed to not installing these mines in densely populated areas. Ukraine reportedly targeted Russian facilities with drones as the Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Nov. 20 that air defense forces shot down 44 drones overnight. Belgorod Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said that drone wreckage damaged the premises of an enterprise in the town of Alekseevka on Nov. 19. Media reports identified the facility as an EFKO plant, officially a sauce manufacturer. Separately, drone strikes were reported also in Voronezh Oblast, with local authorities claiming that five drones struck a civilian industrial facility, starting a fire. The Voronezh and Belgorod oblasts lie at the border with Ukraine and are regularly targeted in cross-border drone strikes. Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council&apos;s counter-disinformation center, said that the EFKO plant also secretly produces cargo drones used by the Russian military. The official said that Ukrainian drones also attacked the 13th Arsenal of the Main Missile and Artillery Directorate of Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry (GRAU) near Kotovo in Novgorod Oblast, some 680 kilometers (420 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s border. According to Kovalenko, the arsenal stores critical military supplies, including artillery shells, multiple-launch rocket system (MLRS) missiles, Iskander and anti-aircraft missiles, and ammunition for various systems, including the Tor complex. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed that 22 drones were shot down over Novgorod Oblast overnight. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. These strikes come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced plans on Nov. 19 to scale up domestic production of long-range drones and missiles. As part of Ukraine&apos;s resilience plan, the country aims to manufacture at least 30,000 long-range drones in the coming year and establish a new technology center to enhance its defense capabilities. Ukrainian forces struck a military arsenal in Karachev, Bryansk Oblast, overnight on Nov. 19, with some reports indicating that Kyiv deployed U.S. ATACMS missiles for the first time on Russian soil. Colonel General Kim Yong Bok, one of the generals accompanying North Korean troops in Russia, is a mystery-shrouded figure close to dictator Kim Jong Un, The Wall Street Journal reported on Nov. 20. Kim Yong Bok, officially the Deputy Chief of the Army General Staff, is expected to oversee the integration of North Korean troops into Russian forces, gain combat experience, and establish a framework for future deployments, the outlet reports. A Ukrainian envoy listed him, along with Major General Sin Kum Cheol and Colonel General Ri Chang Ho, during a U.N. Security Council meeting on Oct. 30 as one of the generals commanding some over 10,000 North Korean troops in Russia. Kim&apos;s role in Pyongyang&apos;s military has long been shrouded in secrecy. He previously commanded a special forces unit of 200,000 soldiers tasked with covert missions on the Korean Peninsula. His profile was elevated after Russian President Vladimir Putin visited North Korea in June, with reports identifying him as the No. 3 figure in the Korean People&apos;s Army, according to the Wall Street Journal&apos;s reporting. In July 2020, Kim was seen alongside Kim Jong Un at a ceremony honoring military officials but largely disappeared from public view until recently. This deployment coincides with North Korea&apos;s formalized mutual defense treaty with Russia, announced on Nov. 12. The agreement obligates the nations to assist each other in the event of an armed attack. The development follows reports of initial clashes between Ukrainian forces and North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. The Western countries denounced the deployment of North Korean troops as an escalation, with the U.S. reportedly responding by permitting Ukraine to launch ATACMS missiles against Russian and North Korean troops amassing in the region. Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump but rejects major territorial concessions and insists that Ukraine abandon plans to join NATO, Reuters reported on Nov. 20, citing five former and current Russian officials. The Kremlin&apos;s terms reportedly include freezing the conflict roughly along current front lines and &quot;dividing control&quot; of eastern regions, including the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts. Moscow, which illegally declared annexation of these regions in September 2022, currently controls only 70-80% of them, with approximately 26,000 square kilometers (10,000 square miles) under Ukrainian control. Putin issued a demand in June that Ukraine must withdraw from the four regions completely before any ceasefire talks. Russia currently occupies roughly a fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory &#x2013; including Crimea &#x2013; as its forces continue to steadily advance in the east. Publicly, the Kremlin has rejected freezing the front line or any concessions on its part, with Putin saying any peace deal must be in Moscow&apos;s favor. According to Reuters, Russian officials suggested that Moscow might consider withdrawing from smaller occupied areas in Ukraine&apos;s Kharkiv and Mykolaiv regions but emphasized that any deal must reflect &quot;realities&quot; on the ground. Moscow remains firmly opposed to NATO membership for Ukraine or the presence of foreign troops on Ukrainian soil, the officials said. Additional demands could reportedly include limiting Ukraine&apos;s military size and guaranteeing unrestricted use of the Russian language. Ukraine has rejected territorial concessions and said any peace talks should be based on its 10-point peace formula, which includes a Russian withdrawal and full territorial integrity and sovereignty. Officials acknowledged that some territories might be returned through diplomacy rather than military means. Kyiv also said that NATO membership is the only way to prevent further Russian aggression. Without a ceasefire, Russia will continue the war, Kremlin sources told Reuters. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the U.S. authorization of ATACMS missiles a &quot;very dangerous escalation.&quot; Trump has positioned himself as a potential peace broker, claiming he could negotiate an end to the war. The contours of Trump&apos;s peace plan remain unclear, though media reports indicate it might entail postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership for 20 years, freezing the front line, and establishing a demilitarized zone in the east manned by European troops. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Nov. 19 that Moscow &quot;will respond accordingly&quot; to Washington&apos;s permission for Ukraine to strike Russian soil with U.S. weapons. Speaking at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Lavrov referred to Russia&apos;s updated nuclear doctrine, which permits nuclear retaliation for attacks by non-nuclear states supported by nuclear powers. When asked during the summit if the U.S. had authorized Ukraine to use long-range weapons to target Russia, Lavrov responded, &quot;I don&apos;t know whether it&apos;s true or not. We are focused on ensuring our security.&quot; &quot;We have already stated everything necessary to those considering this, officially. The president said it, and now it&apos;s confirmed in an official document,&quot; he said, according to TASS. On Nov. 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin approved an updated nuclear deterrence policy that expands the conditions for a nuclear strike. The revised doctrine outlines scenarios that could justify a nuclear strike, suggesting that this could include &quot;aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies by a non-nuclear state with the support of a nuclear state&quot; and large-scale non-nuclear attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-strikes-russia-with-british-for-first-time-media-reports/	2024-11-20T13:15:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2163690000.jpg
Trump names Matthew Whitaker as next US ambassador to NATO	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump named Matthew Whitaker, former acting attorney general, as the next U.S. ambassador to NATO, according to a statement released Nov. 20. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, 25, has been assembling appointees for his upcoming administration, often prizing loyalty over policy expertise. Some nominees have raised alarm, particularly the choice of Fox News host Pete Hegseth as defense secretary and Congressman Mike Waltz as national security advisor. Whitaker&apos;s nomination comes amid concerns that a Trump administration would dramatically reduce U.S. investment in the NATO alliance. &quot;Matt will strengthen relationships with our NATO Allies, and stand firm in the face of threats to Peace and Stability &#x2014; He will put AMERICA FIRST,&quot; Trump&apos;s statement read. There is little known about Whitaker&apos;s foreign policy positions. He worked as a U.S. attorney for the southern district of Iowa before joining the Justice Department in 2017 as Attorney General Jeff Sessions&apos; chief of staff. He then served briefly as acting attorney general after Sessions resigned at Trump&apos;s request. Whitaker has no evident experience in national security, diplomacy, or foreign policy. Whitaker will be a key figure in selling Trump&apos;s much-touted peace deal between Russia and Ukraine to NATO member nations. Trump frequently promised to effect such a deal within &quot;24 hours&quot; of his election. One idea Trump&apos;s team has put forth for ending Russia&apos;s war involves delaying Kyiv&apos;s NATO membership for at least 20 years in exchange for continued arms supplies, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Nov. 6, citing three sources close to Trump. Ukraine submitted a request for NATO membership in 2022 but has not received an invitation, in part because the country is actively at war. NATO accession is also a core component of President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s five-part victory plan, but Kyiv&apos;s bid for membership received a cold response from U.S. President Joe Biden, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and other leaders.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-names-matthew-whitaker-as-next-us-ambassador-to-nato/	2024-11-20T13:11:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2165596076.jpg
Russian troops killed 2 Ukrainian POWs near Pokrovsk, prosecutors say	Russian troops have killed two Ukrainian prisoners of war in Donetsk Oblast&apos;s Pokrovsk District, the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor&apos;s Office said on Nov. 20. They were stripped naked and shot dead, according to the prosecutors. In a picture published by the prosecutors, two blurred naked bodies are seen lying on the ground. &#x201C;On Nov. 10, the enemy stormed our fortifications near the village of Novodmytrivka, Pokrovsk district,&#x201D; the prosecutors said. &#x201C;After the Russian army captured two Ukrainian soldiers, they forced the men to strip naked. After being led at gunpoint through a forest plantation, the prisoners were shot dead.&#x201D; The prosecutor&#x2019;s office said that it is also investigating whether Russian soldiers killed three more Ukrainian prisoners. Reports of murders, torture, and ill-treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war are received regularly by Ukrainian authorities and have spiked in recent months. Most cases were recorded in embattled Donetsk Oblast. Russian forces had executed at least 124 Ukrainian prisoners of war since 2022 as of Nov. 6. On top of that, at least 177 Ukrainian prisoners have died in Russian captivity, according to a representative of the Ukrainian Coordination Center for the Treatment of Prisoners of War. On one occasion, a photo of an apparently executed Ukrainian soldier with a sword in his chest and the inscription &quot;For Kursk&quot; has appeared on social media, with remnants of gray tape visible on the soldier&apos;s hand. Executing prisoners of war is a gross violation of the Geneva Conventions.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-military-reportedly-stripped-and-shot-two-ukrainain-pows-in-the-pokrovsk-region/	2024-11-20T12:36:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2075450212.jpg
Secret Russian plan sees Ukraine cut into 3 parts, intelligence source confirms	Russia will try to convey to U.S. leadership its plan for a new world order up to the year 2045, including a scheme to break Ukraine up into three parts, the Interfax Ukraine news agency reported on Nov. 20. An intelligence community source confirmed the existence of the plan to the Kyiv Independent. According to the plan, developed by the Russian Defense Ministry, Ukraine would be divided into thirds. The country&apos;s western lands would be offered to neighboring countries, including Poland, Hungary, and Romania. The eastern regions, including partially and fully Russian-occupied territories, &#xA0;would be annexed by Russia. The remaining territory, including Kyiv, would become a Russian-controlled puppet state. The plan envisages the effective dissolution of the independent Ukrainian state. The Russian Defense Ministry also put forward four different scenarios of global world order development &#x2014; two seen as favorable to Moscow and two disadvantageous. Two of the scenarios, labeled &quot;Formation of a multipolar world and the division of spheres of influence by leading actors&quot; and &quot;Regionalization/chaotization,&quot; involve a Russian victory over Ukraine. The others, &quot;Dominance of the USA and the West&quot; and &quot;Acquisition by China of the status of the world&apos;s leading power,&quot; presuppose a military defeat in Ukraine. The latest plan marks another Russian attempt to put forward suggestions for the disruption and recreation of a global world order. The Kremlin convened meetings in 2022 and 2023 to find ways to dismantle the post-World War II global financial system and undermine U.S. power over global transactions, according to documents obtained by the Washington Post. &quot;One of the most important tasks is to create a new world order,&quot; one of the documents dated April 3, 2023, reportedly said. &quot;Western countries led by the United States have tried to impose their own structure, based on their dominance.&quot; The new plan&apos;s proposed breakup of Ukraine reflects the maximalist goals of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, which include regime change in Kyiv and &quot;demilitarization&quot; of the Ukrainian state.	https://kyivindependent.com/secret-russian-plan-sees-ukraine-cut-into-3-parts-intelligence-source-confirms/	2024-11-20T12:35:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1251911412.jpg
Panic grips Kyiv as embassy closures and Telegram rumors fuel fears of imminent attack	Ukrainians woke up on Nov. 20 to a message that a number of foreign embassies were closing their Kyiv offices &#x2014; a stark reminder of the departure of foreign diplomats from Kyiv days before the start of the all-out war. The U.S. Embassy in the capital said it had received &quot;specific information&quot; about a &quot;potential significant air attack&quot; planned for that day. &quot;Out of an abundance of caution, the Embassy will be closed, and Embassy employees are being instructed to shelter in place,&quot; the statement read. The announcement came in the wake of what appeared to be Ukraine&apos;s first successful strike of a military target inside Russia using the U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles. After depicting such a move as crossing another &quot;red line&quot; the Kremlin had drawn, Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country would respond. A mass attack using cruise and ballistic missiles, as well as drones, was the most expected outcome. Throughout the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin has repeatedly laid down red lines, the crossing of which it has said could provoke various responses, sometimes invoking the threat of nuclear weapons. In an attempt to deter Ukraine&apos;s Western allies from further arming Kyiv, the Kremlin issued warnings related to the supply of Patriot air defense systems, F-16 fighter jets, and ATACMS to be used in occupied areas of Ukraine, among others. Despite crossing multiple red lines on multiple occasions, Russia has yet to follow through with any of its threats. What has spooked some observers about the latest crossing is that it happened just hours before Putin approved the updated principles of Russia&apos;s nuclear deterrence policy. One of the provisions of the new policy states that &quot;aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies by a non-nuclear state with the support of a nuclear state&quot; could justify a nuclear strike &#x2014; Ukraine using ATACMS to strike deep inside Russia would appear to qualify. Shortly after the U.S. Embassy issued its warning, the Spanish, Greek, and Italian embassies followed suit, and the news quickly spread on Ukrainian Telegram channels. Most of them urged that on this day, it&apos;s especially worth taking shelter during air raid alerts. In central Kyiv, there were mixed responses to the reports. Nina Stupak, 83, said she hadn&apos;t seen the specific warning from the U.S. embassy, but her neighbors had called her to tell her about it. &quot;Of course, I am really scared about this threat, and especially I am worried about the lives of my children and grandchildren,&quot; she told the Kyiv Independent while out shopping in the city&apos;s Podil district. Petro Karpenko, an 18-year-old student, was more blas&#xE9;. &quot;I am not worried because there is a stable situation in Kyiv,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;There have already been massive attacks on Kyiv from May to July. I&apos;ve got used to it more or less.&quot; Shortly after midday, Andrii Kovalenko of Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, repeated an appeal he issued earlier in the morning, stating that Russian mass aerial attacks have been in the planning for months, and the embassy closures shouldn&apos;t mean Ukrainians act any differently. &quot;Ukrainians already understand the situation &#x2014; you need to plan your time and prepare safe places for yourself in case of alarm, calculate the route and the time it takes to reach these safe places can be reached,&quot; he said in a post on Telegram. Kovalenko, who heads the counter-disinformation department, added that Russia was trying to exploit the situation by &quot;stoking panic against the backdrop of the closing of embassies.&quot; Local residents take shelter in a metro station during an air strike alarm in Kyiv, Ukraine on Nov. 20, 2024, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. (Roman Pilipey / AFP via Getty Images)But the warnings weren&apos;t just limited to diplomats and Telegram channels &#x2014; Ukrainian soldiers were also alerted about a potential Russian mass ballistic missile attack, a source in the Ukrainian military told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;According to intelligence reports, a massive missile attack using ballistic missiles is possible today,&quot; a message received by Ukrainian soldiers said. When asked about the alert, at least one Ukrainian soldier was unmoved by the apparent threat. &quot;In case anyone hasn&apos;t noticed, we are at war with Russia,&quot; Lieutenant Colonel Bohdan Krotevych, chief of staff of Azov 12th Special Forces Brigade, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Yesterday was no different from the days before it or those to come. Russia doesn&apos;t need to adopt any doctrines to use one weapon or another. This topic isn&apos;t even worth discussing.&quot; Further stoking tensions were reports in Ukrainian media about rumors of Russia testing new weapons as part of their planned retaliation. &quot;According to unconfirmed information, it is an RS-26 &apos;Rubezh&apos; intercontinental (ballistic) missile,&quot; one outlet wrote in an article published at 1:45 p.m. At 1:49 p.m., the air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv and several other oblasts. An almost everyday occurrence, after more than two-and-a-half years of full-scale war, they rarely cause anyone to blink, let alone head to a shelter. But today was different &#x2014; many of those on the streets changed direction and quickened their pace, heading to the nearest metro station, the safest place to be during an attack.&quot; Usually, I do not go down to the metro or shelter because I am not really worried about attacks,&quot; 24-year-old Andriy Bohdantsov told the Kyiv Independent from the underground metro station where hundreds of people had gathered. &quot;But today, due to the U.S. Embassy warning, I&apos;ve decided to come here. &quot;For me, this situation today is like a flashback of past events, specifically, when people were saying that war wouldn&apos;t start, but it had started,&quot; he added, referring to the days leading up to the launch of the full-scale invasion in 2022 when constant U.S. intelligence assessments warning of an imminent attack were played down by Ukrainian authorities. The closure of the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv on Feb. 14, 2022, ten days before the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, has been engraved in the memories of many Ukrainians who were left to witness the unfolding war. Telegram channels that monitor Russian missile launches reported two ballistic missiles heading for Kyiv, but shortly after said they had &quot;ceased to exist&quot; &#x2014; either being intercepted, or being fake launches using electronic warfare (EW). At 2:21 p.m. the all clear sounded, and hundreds of people filed out of the metro to resume their day as best they could. At exactly the same time, Kovalenko&apos;s warnings about a Russian disinformation campaign aimed at stoking panic in Kyiv appeared to be confirmed. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) warned on its Telegram channel that Russian intelligence services were amplifying the panic by spreading fake messages in messengers and social media about the supposedly upcoming attack. The agency showed one message about the attack spread in messengers and social media, saying it was &quot;fake and contains grammatical errors typical for Russian psychological operations.&quot; &quot;The enemy, unable to subjugate Ukrainians by force, resorts to measures of intimidation and psychological pressure on society. Please be vigilant,&quot; the statement read. &quot;Do not ignore air raid signals&#x2014;it is safer to wait in a shelter. However, we urge you not to panic.&quot; A woman walks past the US Embassy in Kyiv on Nov. 20, 2024, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. (Tanya Dzafarowa / AFP via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent&apos;s military source clarified that the aerial strike threat remains relevant, but Russia is carrying out a parallel psychological operation to sow panic. At around 3 p.m., Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry released a statement criticizing the decision of Western embassies to issue warnings and close earlier in the day, describing the moves as &quot;information overreaction.&quot; &quot;On this 1,001st day of the full-scale invasion, the threat of Russian strikes remains just as relevant as it has been for the past thousand days,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi said. Around the same time, Telegram monitoring channels reported seven Russian Tu-95 bombers were redeploying to the Engels airbase, a possible indication of preparation for an attack. At 7:46 p.m., other channels reported they had been joined there by a further two Tu-95s. Around an hour later, the U.S. Embassy &#xA0;it had &quot;resumed services following a temporary shelter-in-place suspension earlier today.&quot; &quot;We continue to encourage U.S. citizens to remain vigilant, monitor official Ukrainian sources for updates, and be prepared to shelter in place if an air alert is announced,&quot; it added. At the time of writing, 10:00 p.m., there have been no further air raid alerts in Kyiv, no further embassy warnings, and little further information on the Russian bombers, and even less on what their plans for attack might be. Martyniuk Oksana, a 26-year-old mother currently on maternity leave, told the Kyiv Independent that given all the information being pumped out by embassies, social media, and government officials, it was &quot;understandable that there is confusion. &quot;Of course, I am scared of this situation, and I can only hope there will not be a massive attack.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/panic-grips-kyiv-as-embassy-closures-and-telegram-rumors-fuel-fears-of-imminent-attack/	2024-11-20T12:19:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185112049.jpg
Russia only wins if the West quits' — Gen. Ben Hodges	The first reports of Ukraine striking deep inside Russia with U.S.-supplied ATACMS emerged on Nov. 19, marking a long-awaited shift in White House policy that could bolster Ukraine&apos;s defense against a 50,000-strong joint Russian-North Korean force assembled against them. President Joe Biden&apos;s decision to finally grant Kyiv permission to use ATACMS is likely one of the last significant contributions to the war in Ukraine before Donald Trump takes up residence in the White House on Jan. 20. With election promises of ending the war in &quot;24 hours,&quot; and cabinet appointments marked equally by inexperience and disdain for the fate of Ukraine, a Trump-led U.S. will have a profoundly different stance towards Kyiv than the previous administration. A few hours before reports of the strikes in Bryansk Oblast, the Kyiv Independent sat down with retired U.S. General Ben Hodges for his take on ATACMS, the prospect of peace negotiations, and how he feels personally about Ukraine&apos;s future. Editor&apos;s note: This is a transcript of the video interview that has been edited for clarity and brevity. The Kyiv Independent: This week, we heard the news that the Biden administration is going to authorize long-range strikes inside Russia. What do you think is the significance of the timing? Ben Hodges: I&apos;m not sure why this finally happened. Obviously this is something that should have happened two years ago. I&apos;m glad it did happen, but I&apos;m not sure what finally caused it. Perhaps it had something to do with North Korea&apos;s involvement. I&apos;m not sure. I am still frustrated that it&apos;s not a complete lifting of restrictions, that it still applies only to use against Russian and North Korean forces that are attacking the Kursk bridgehead. So it&apos;s better than nothing, but it still falls short of what&apos;s actually needed. The Kyiv Independent: A lot of people have pointed out that this probably won&apos;t be a game changer, but what will Ukraine be able to do now that it wasn&apos;t able to do before? Ben Hodges: I&apos;ve never liked the phrase &apos;game changer&apos; because the only thing that would really be a game changer would be if the Bidenadministration, and other European governments would say, &quot;we want Ukraine to actually win this war&quot; and then commit to that. New weapons or permissions by themselves are not game changing. Nonetheless, this is still a positive step. I would anticipate that the Ukrainian General Staff will use these to target Russian headquarters, logistics, and artillery. That&apos;s how you defeat mass, and mass is the only advantage that the Russian forces have, the big numbers (of troops). And if you can destroy the headquarters that are necessary to coordinate their movements and their support, if you can destroy the artillery that enables their attacks, and if you can destroy the logistics that provide the artillery ammunition, then I think you can really degrade the effectiveness of Russian mass attacks.

(Yevhenii Vasyliev/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: With the election of Donald Trump, there&apos;s a sort of a deadline now. Trump has said he&apos;s going to try and stop or freeze the war quickly. Do you think the timing of the decision for ATACMS has that in mind? Ben Hodges: The Biden administration would certainly have been very conscious of the fact that the inauguration is only two months away, and that possibly influenced the thinking somehow. I&apos;m not sure. But as I reflected on this all day yesterday, this is actually a gift from the Biden administration to the Trump administration, to have this policy in place so the Trump administration can just leave it (in place) or use it as a point of increased leverage against the Russians &#x2014; or not. Of course, I don&apos;t know what the Trump administration is going to do based on everything they&apos;ve said during the campaign. I&apos;m not hopeful that they&apos;re going to be supportive of Ukraine, but I am hopeful that the leadership of the Republican Party in Congress, both in the Senate and in the House, who are mostly pro-Ukraine, pro-NATO, pro-transatlantic, will be able to convey to the new administration how important it is that the United States to not turn its back on Ukraine. We&apos;ll see if they have the ability and the courage to push back against Trump&apos;s designs to end the war in 24 hours. And, of course, these kinds of ridiculous assertions that he can end the war in 24 hours or freeze it somehow assume that Ukraine will just go along with it or that Eastern European countries &#x2014; who are not confused about the threat that is Russia &#x2014; that they&apos;ll just go along with it. I doubt that&apos;s the case because most of them know that they will end up paying the price if this conflict is frozen. None of them believe for a second that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin would ever live up to any agreement. So I think once the Trump administration is in place, and they&apos;re faced with the reality of owning the situation and the implications, then perhaps that will moderate some of the language that comes from the incoming administration. The Kyiv Independent: And how important is it that Ukraine retains some territory in Kursk Oblast by the time that Trump comes into office? Because if Trump does try to impose a freeze of the front lines, obviously Ukrainian troops on Russian soil greatly complicates things for the Kremlin. Ben Hodges: This was one of the reasons I have been a supporter of the Ukrainian decision to launch the Kursk counteroffensive because it does create a real problem for the Kremlin. Both in terms of whether or not to commit forces to try and eliminate this bridgehead and in terms of some sort of negotiations coming up. So, it does create a problem, and I think this was a brilliant move by the Ukrainian General Staff. Now, at the end of the day, the Ukrainian General Staff will have to decide if it is worth it. Are they getting the benefit of this versus the casualties and the costs of hanging onto it? We&apos;ll see. They will know much better than I ever will. But again, Trump cannot impose a freeze on this conflict. There are no American soldiers there. Europe is providing more aid combined than the United States is. So I think the idea that somehow Trump can impose a freeze or impose a ceasefire, that&apos;s just not what&apos;s going to happen. He can, of course, demand it. He can, of course, stop all aid. But I think that people with cooler heads will understand that it&apos;s in our interest that Europe remains stable, secure, and prosperous for our own economic reasons. And China is watching to see how we handle this. The Kyiv Independent: What sort of leverage will Trump have over Putin to try to get him to stop? Obviously, in Donbas, the Russian offensive is still relatively slow, but it&apos;s gaining pace. So Putin does have the upper hand there. So what kind of thing can Trump do to try and force Putin into a deal? Ben Hodges: There are so many things that we have not done yet. We have not imposed all the sanctions that could have been imposed. We have not taken steps to block Russia from exporting oil and gas to China and India, which is what generates the money necessary for Russia to be able to buy ammunition and weapons from Iran and North Korea. We&apos;ve done nothing against those things. So there are still economic tools remaining for the incoming administration. And, of course, he could say, &apos;I&apos;m going to accelerate delivery of ATACMs,&apos; for example, or other capabilities. So, the incoming president has a lot of leverage to build on what the Biden administration has already done, which has fallen well short of what I think could have been done. So, Trump will have a lot of leverage against Putin. Does he want to use that? That&apos;s what remains to be seen. The Kyiv Independent: You mentioned China just before. What do you think China is hoping to see when Trump takes office? Ben Hodges: I think the Chinese are waiting to see if the U.S. and our allies have the political will to actually defend these post-war constructs of respect for sovereignty, freedom of navigation, respect for international law, respect for international agreements. If we&apos;re not willing to do that in Europe, they may think we&apos;re not willing to do that out in the Indo-Pacific region, where, frankly, it will be much more difficult to do &#x2014; it takes nine days for a U.S. Navy ship to go all the way from Hawaii to Japan, for example. I think the Chinese are going to be watching that. They&apos;ll be watching to see if Trump follows through on the threat to impose these massive tariffs that will have a significant impact. I think, like everyone, they want to know how much of what was said in the campaign is actually going to happen in reality. The Kyiv Independent: Earlier on, you alluded to the differences in how particularly Eastern European states perceive the Russian threat and how America perceives the Russian threat. How do you think that&apos;s going to play out with an increasingly isolationist U.S.? Is Europe going to be able to fill that gap if aid slows or if they reduce support in other ways? Ben Hodges: Well, they certainly can. The combined economies of the European Union &#x2014; forget Canada and the U.K. &#x2014; the combined economies of the European Union are about eight times greater than Russia. So this is about political will. It&apos;s not about economic capacity or industrial capacity. It&apos;s about political will. And so what I would hope is that Europe, led by a new German government coming in February, probably led by Friedrich Merz and the CDU, Poland under Donald Tusk, Finland under Alexander Stubb, and Italy under Prime Minister Meloni, that together they could convince the American president &apos;hey, don&apos;t turn your back on Europe.&apos; We still need an American nuclear deterrent. But we, Europe, can pick up the slack if the U.S. needs to back away from its support for Ukraine. There&apos;s a lot of potential in Europe. The question is, do they have the political will? The Kyiv Independent: And just to finish with, how do you personally feel about the future for Ukraine? Ben Hodges: I&apos;ve always believed in the eventual victory of Ukraine, not because I want it to be so, but because I have seen what Ukraine has been able to accomplish over the last 11 years, that they have stopped Russia without consistent, decisive aid from the U.S. or from Europe. I mean, this war started in 2014. So all the people talking about how today is 1,000 days &#x2014; that&apos;s only 1,000 days since the large-scale invasion. It&apos;s been almost 7,000 days since Russia first invaded Ukraine. And after 11 years, almost 7,000 days, Russia still only controls about 20% of Ukraine, and they have suffered devastating losses. Russian industry is in tatters. And so I think it&apos;s clear to me that there&apos;s no way Russia can just knock Ukraine out of the war unless we in the West quit. So this sort of resilience and determination by Ukrainian soldiers and people, emergency services, is something that we&apos;re all going to be studying and admiring for a very long time.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-only-wins-if-the-west-quits-gen-ben-hodges/	2024-11-20T11:56:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2175488443.jpg
Court jails Russian actor in absentia, confiscates his Odesa apartment	A Ukrainian court has sentenced Russian actor Vladimir Mashkov to 10 years in prison in absentia and ordered the confiscation of his apartment in Odesa, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) reported on its Telegram channel on Nov. 20. Mashkov, who was convicted for war propaganda and for encouraging the violation of Ukraine&#x2019;s territorial integrity, owned a 147 square meter apartment on the seacoast in Odesa. He has performed in various Russian pro-war events and is a vocal supporter of President Vladimir Putin and Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. He was also a co-chairman of Putin&apos;s election headquarters during Russia&apos;s 2024 presidential election. &#x201C;As head of a leading theater, he used theatrical and media resources to propagate the Kremlin&apos;s ideology to a large audience,&#x201D; Ukraine&#x2019;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office wrote on Telegram. Mashkov, who currently resides in Russia, did not appear at the court.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-court-sentences-russian-actor-vladimir-mashkov-to-10-years-of-prison-and-confiscation-of-apartment-in-absentia/	2024-11-20T11:21:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/--------_-------_2019-1.jpg
Delayed by war, Ukraine’s long-awaited 'S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2' surges to the top of video game purchases	More than two years after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion delayed its release and upended its developers&#x2019; lives, Ukraine&#x2019;s &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&quot; &#x2014; one of the most anticipated video games of the year &#x2014; was released on Nov. 20. Employees of GSC Game World, the Ukrainian company behind its creation, completed the game while navigating blackouts, missile strikes, scattered employees, and the challenge of restarting operations from a new office in Prague. Originally set for a release in April 2022, the game experienced several delays when many of its staff were forced to flee Ukraine that February. Ahead of the release this week, presales of the game took it to the top spot for games sold on the popular video game platform Steam. Like the 2007 original in the series, which has been played by millions, &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&quot;: Heart of Chornobyl is a first-person immersive shooter game set in a fictionalized version of Chornobyl&apos;s exclusion zone after an apocalyptic nuclear disaster. The war affected more than just the timing of the game&apos;s release. After the full-scale invasion, the game&apos;s name was changed to use the Ukrainian spelling of Chornobyl, instead of the Russian version, &quot;Chernobyl.&quot; GSC Game World also removed Russian voiceovers and has refused to sell the game in Russia. The game developers have spoken about facing Russian threats and frequent hacking attempts because of their decisions. In a documentary about the game&#x2019;s creation released in October, Anton Kukhtytskyi, the game&#x2019;s lead concept artist, described his first weeks of the full-scale war. For two weeks, he had no electricity, internet, or connection outside his village.

(GSC Game World)A significant portion of the staff still remains in Ukraine. Because of the developers&apos; vocal support for Ukrainian armed forces and the content of the game, a Russian official suggested this month that purchases of the game in Russia could be criminalized after its release. (While GSC Game World products are not officially available in Russia, users have reported workarounds online.) Prior to the full-scale invasion, Ukraine was home to hundreds of video game companies and an estimated tens of thousands of Ukrainian video game developers. GSC Game World was founded in Kyiv in 1995 and is one of the oldest and most prominent video game developers in the country. In addition to &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.,&quot; the company is known for its &quot;Cossacks&quot; strategy game franchise. Since 2020, the company is co-owned by Maksym Krippa, a wealthy Ukrainian businessman who has kept a low profile and mostly avoided public attention. Krippa&apos;s career is reportedly connected with casinos and gambling businesses, though GSC Game World distanced itself from his former activities, stating his portfolio no longer holds gambling companies. In the past several years, Krippa has built up significant stakes in online gaming and real estate, including the 2018 purchase of Ukraine&apos;s major e-sports league NAVI and a subsequent deal to become co-owner of Maincast, an e-sports broadcasting studio. &#xA0; He made headlines recently with real estate purchases of the Parus business center in Kyiv last year, which Forbes Ukraine dubbed &quot;the largest deal since the start of the full-scale war,&quot; and purchases of major hotels in downtown Kyiv.

UN World Food Program allocates $2.1 billion to Ukraine until 2027	The U.N.&#x2019;s World Food Program has allocated $2.1 billion for Ukraine between 2025 and 2027, Ukraine&#x2019;s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Telegram on Nov. 20. &#x201C;The plan provides for humanitarian assistance, support for civilians, continuation of the demining process and support for Ukraine&apos;s export potential in supplying agricultural products to international markets,&#x201D; he said. According to a U.N. estimate, Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine has caused $80 billion worth of damage to its agricultural sector. Before the war, Ukraine&#x2019;s agricultural output could feed 400 million people worldwide. Russia&#x2019;s invasion, however, disrupted supply chains and trade routes, driving up food prices globally.	https://kyivindependent.com/un-world-food-program-allocates-2-1-billion-to-ukraine-until-2027/	2024-11-20T10:14:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173387817.jpg
US announces $275 million military aid package for Ukraine	The United States will send a new military package worth $275 million to Ukraine, the Pentagon said in a statement on Nov. 20. It will include HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) ammunition, artillery shells, and Javelin surface-to-air missiles, in addition to a wide range of spare parts and equipment. &#x201C;The United States will continue to work together with some 50 Allies and partners to meet Ukraine&apos;s urgently needed battlefield requirements and defend against Russian aggression,&#x201D; the statement read. Outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration has supported Ukraine with $60 billion in military aid. However, the future of the U.S. commitment to providing arms to Ukraine remains uncertain as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office in January 2025. Trump has promised a quick end to the war, but did not elaborate on how he intends to achieve this. A likely scenario is using the suspension of aid as a tool to force Ukraine into negotiations with Russia. Since his rival&#x2019;s election victory, Biden has vowed to provide Ukraine with additional aid &#x201C;to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position,&#x201D; according to the Pentagon&#x2019;s statement. Biden has also authorized the delivery of anti-personnel land mines to Ukraine, his Secretary of Defense Austin Loyd told reporters on Nov. 20 in Laos. The decision is expected to help slow down Russia&apos;s advance in the east of the country. The move follows the Biden administration&apos;s authorization of the use of U.S.-made long-range missiles to strike Russian territory. Kyiv has not officially confirmed the claims, but recent reports indicate Ukraine struck targets in Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast with ATACMS missiles.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-announces-275-million-military-aid-package-for-ukraine/	2024-11-20T08:50:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184603402.jpg
Ukraine strikes Russia with Storm Shadows for the first time, Bloomberg reports	Ukraine has struck targets inside Russia with British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles for the first time, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 20, citing a Western official familiar with the matter. According to the source, the strikes were approved as a response to the presence of North Korean troops in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, a sign of escalation by Russia. Different versions of Storm Shadow missiles have a range of between 250 and 560 kilometers. Storm Shadows have been used to hit Russian military targets in Crimea, a sovereign Ukrainian territory illegally annexed by Russia. The reported strikes come a day after Ukraine reportedly used U.S.-made ATACMS long-range missiles to attack Russian territory, following outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s approval on Nov. 17. That strike reportedly hit a Russian military facility in Karachev, Bryansk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-russia-with-storm-shadows-for-the-first-time-bloomberg-reports/	2024-11-20T07:35:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2163689551.jpg
ATACMS boost for Ukraine as Trump inauguration looms	The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Nov. 19 that Ukraine had launched the U.S.-made ATACMS missiles against Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast. Hours prior, Ukraine struck a Russian military facility in Karachev, Bryansk Oblast, a two-hour drive from the Ukrainian-controlled part of Russia. President Joe Biden&apos;s decision to finally allow Ukraine to use ATACMS against Russian and North Korean forces comes with a looming deadline &#x2014; the inauguration of Donald Trump on Jan. 20. The new president is widely expected to lead a dramatic shift in U.S. policy towards the war, focused on attempts to get Kyiv and Moscow to negotiate. Both sides will be looking to enter any possible talks in the most favorable position possible, with territory in Kursk Oblast potentially being some of the most politically valuable of all. &quot;Many of our fellow citizens will be hurt by these words, but the defense of Kursk Oblast is a higher priority than the Kurakhiv bridgehead, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts,&quot; Dmytro Zhmailo, a military expert and executive director of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center, told the Kyiv Independent. The ability to finally use the long-range missiles to attack military facilities in Kursk Oblast and its surroundings is expected to give Ukraine a better chance to hold on to the Russian territories that are said to be the last major ace in Kyiv&apos;s rather unfavorable hand. The Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) is a U.S.-made, short-range, supersonic ballistic missile. The ATACMS have a range of up to 300 kilometers, can be equipped with either high explosive or cluster munition warheads, and are fired from U.S.-made 142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). They&apos;re not new to the war in Ukraine &#x2014; in the fall of 2023, the U.S. began supplying Kyiv with an older model of ATACMS with a range of around 165 kilometers. In the spring of 2024, the New York Times (NYT) reported that the U.S. had shipped around 100 updated versions of ATACMS missiles, which can reach up to 300 kilometers. Ukraine has put both variants into effect on the battlefield, striking targets in occupied Crimea and other parts of Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine.

(South Korean Defense Ministry via Getty Images)How could ATACMS help in Kursk?After Ukraine launched its incursion into Kursk Oblast, Kyiv said one of the main aims of the operation was to prevent Moscow from sending additional reinforcements to the front in Ukraine&apos;s east. Yet, Russia&apos;s grinding advances in Donetsk Oblast have only gained pace in the months since, with large chunks of Ukrainian territory, sometimes including entire towns, lost on a near-daily basis in southern Donetsk Oblast. Without diverting troops from eastern Ukraine, Russia has been able to assemble a force of nearly 50,000 troops in Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 11, including more than 10,000 soldiers from North Korea. Militarily, this particular aim in Kursk Oblast has failed, but Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. presidential election has dramatically changed the calculus. The president-elect has long promised to bring a swift end to the war in Ukraine, and although he has not elaborated on his plans, it&apos;s been widely reported that it will involve a freezing of the front lines shortly after he takes office.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)According to experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent, Ukraine&apos;s territory in Kursk has now soared in political value and would be a strong bargaining chip in any negotiations. &quot;Moscow wants to go into any negotiations with the dominant narrative that Ukraine is getting progressively weaker and less able to sustain the war, with allies that are growing tired of supporting Kyiv, whereas Moscow can keep up this level of effort forever,&quot; Jenny Mathers, senior lecturer in international politics at Aberystwyth University, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Anything that raises questions about that narrative, such as a newly empowered Ukrainian force in Russia, or the easing of restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of Western weapons, or greater energy and enthusiasm for the fight on the side of Ukraine&apos;s allies, is a danger to Russia&apos;s position.&quot; If Ukraine can hold on until Trump takes office, it could make the idea of Russian President Vladimir Putin agreeing to any proposal to freeze the war unfeasible, as freezing the war with a front line inside Russia would likely be a non-starter for the Kremlin. &quot;Our presence in Russia negates its power,&quot; Zhmailo said. &quot;It also strengthens our negotiating position, and offsets the principle of the Russians, various peace doves, the Chinese-Brazilian initiative, and the African initiative to freeze the actual front line. &quot;That is why the Russians have become so active now.&quot; But this all relies on one thing &#x2014; Ukraine being able to hold on to territory in Kursk Oblast, and fend off the 50,000-strong force now assembled to assault Kyiv&apos;s positions. According to John Foreman CBE, the U.K.&apos;s former defense attache in Moscow from 2019 to 2022, the decision to allow Ukraine to use ATACMS against Russian and North Korean forces in Kursk Oblast is at least in part an effort to help Kyiv hold on to as much territory as possible before Trump takes office and tries to freeze the front lines. &quot;Plus a reaction to North Korea sending troops and Russia pummeling Ukrainian cities,&quot; he added. &quot;Like with any weapon introduced it will not win the war by itself,&quot; Sascha Bruchmann, a military analyst at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;But it will make it more difficult for the Russians to command their troops effectively and supply them adequately from even further afar.&quot; Bruchmann points to the effect U.S.-supplied HIMARS had in Ukraine when they first arrived in the summer of 2022, compelling Russian forces to move command centers and logistical nodes out of their 80-kilometer range after a series of devastating Ukrainian strikes. &quot;It will make it more difficult for the Russians to command their troops effectively, and supply them adequately from even further afar,&quot; Bruchmann said. &quot;For example, Russian transport hubs such as train junctions that feed the front lines in Kursk or Belgorod are now more vulnerable.&quot; Ukrainian reported an attack against a Russian arsenal in Karachev&#x431; overnight on Nov. 19, reportedly &#x435;&#x444;&#x43A;&#x43F;&#x443;&#x435;&#x443;&#x432; stored artillery ammunition, including North Korean munitions, KAB guided bombs, anti-aircraft missiles, and rocket launcher ammunition. Retired U.S. Lieutenant General Ben Hodges agreed with Burchman, saying while strikes like this won&apos;t be a &quot;game changer,&quot; it is nonetheless &quot;still a positive step.&quot; &quot;I would anticipate that the Ukrainian General Staff will use these to target Russian headquarters, logistics, and artillery,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;That&apos;s how you defeat mass and mass is the only advantage that the Russian forces have, the big numbers.&quot; On the ground in Kursk Oblast, the political machinations of Biden&apos;s ATACMS decision prompted more questions than answers from at least one soldier. &quot;I look at it all, and it&apos;s all a big show to me,&quot; Dmytro, a medic with Ukraine 61st Mechanized Brigade who has been stationed in Kursk Oblast since the start of the incursion, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Why didn&apos;t they give it earlier? Why did we take so long? Because it was simply profitable for someone to drag it all out, that&apos;s all. That is, human life is not valued, human resources are not valued, but something else is valued.&quot; A Ukrainian drone Unit commander with the call sign Boxer (right) stands in front of Ukrainian vehicles parked at a Ukrainian military position and former Russian military position in the Ukrainian-controlled territory of Sudzha, Kursk Oblast, Russia, on Aug. 18, 2024. (Ed Ram/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)What is Kyiv saying?Officially, holding territory in Kursk Oblast is not about holding a bargaining chip in future negotiations but defending Ukraine&apos;s Sumy Oblast from attacks, Ukrainian lawmaker and the chair of the parliament&apos;s foreign affairs policy Oleksandr Merezhko told the Kyiv Independent. But he added that as well as having a military purpose, it does hold political weight in the context of peace talks. &quot;It might help to force Putin to negotiate in earnest,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;Because holding this territory shows the weakness of Putin, his inability to guarantee security within the country.&quot; While it may not be the official position, Zelensky has alluded to the bargaining power of holding territory in Kursk Oblast, saying on Sept. 4 that the &quot;same attitude&quot; was applied to trading captured territories as trading captured prisoners of war (POWs). And the mood music in Kyiv has shifted dramatically since the Nov. 5 election, with Zelensky saying on Nov. 16 that the war will &quot;end faster&quot; under a Trump administration, adding that Ukraine must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means. &quot;There is a tendency to see Trump&apos;s election and looming presidency as nothing but bad news for Ukraine, but the sense that this stage of the war is coming to some kind of a resolution may have created some urgency and pace that may work in Ukraine&apos;s favor,&quot; Mathers said. &quot;Without the sense of the ticking clock produced by Trump&apos;s approaching inauguration, there is the risk that Ukraine&apos;s territorial gains in Russia could have just dwindled to little or nothing, gradually over time. &quot;So, by creating a new momentum, I think Trump has affected events quite a lot.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/atacms-boost-for-ukraine-as-trump-inauguration-looms/	2024-11-20T06:58:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182505497.jpg
Parliament adopts bill to strip individuals supporting Russia of state awards	Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament adopted a law on Nov. 20 allowing the deprivation of state awards from individuals who &quot;popularize or propagandize&quot; Russia or commit other illegal actions against the Ukrainian state. The law, supported by 283 lawmakers, was introduced as a presidential bill and enables the National Security and Defense Council to revoke state awards through sanctions enacted by a presidential decree, according to Ukrainian MP Pavlo Frolov. European Solidarity MP Iryna Herashchenko explained that the law amends the Criminal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure, and other legislation to target individuals convicted of serious crimes, actions against Ukraine&#x2019;s national security, or the promotion and justification of Russia&apos;s occupation of Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky initiated the draft law on July 16, aiming to address cases where state honors were awarded to individuals later found supporting Russia or violating Ukrainian laws. In 2022, a petition to strip pro-Russian Ukrainian lawmaker Yurii Boyko of the Hero of Ukraine title surpassed the threshold for presidential review. However, the process stalled, highlighting the need for a formal legal mechanism to revoke state honors.	https://kyivindependent.com/state-awards/	2024-11-20T06:26:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167201231.jpg
Latest strikes on Ukraine’s electricity substations threaten ‘power failure,' Greenpeace warns	Greenpeace has warned that Ukraine&#x2019;s power grid faces a &quot;heightened risk of catastrophic failure&quot; after a mass missile and drone attack on Nov. 17 targeted electrical substations essential for nuclear power plants, the Guardian reported on Nov. 20. The strikes highlight Russia&#x2019;s strategy to weaken Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure, intensifying the strain on the country&#x2019;s nuclear power plants, which supply two-thirds of its electricity. Experts warn that disrupting power to these facilities could lead to severe safety risks. The recent Russian strikes targeted substations vital for the operation of the three remaining Ukraine-run nuclear power plants: Rivne, Khmelnytskyi, and South Ukraine. While the reactors were not directly hit, Greenpeace claims that the damage to substations could destabilize the grid, increasing the likelihood of dangerous shutdowns at the nuclear sites. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed that trunk power lines connecting the substations to the nuclear plants were severed, with explosions reported near the Khmelnytskyi plant. As a result, six of nine reactors were operating at reduced capacity by Nov. 17. Russia launched around 210 missiles and drones during the attack, Ukrenergo said, causing &#x201C;serious damage&#x201D; to thermal power plants and triggering nationwide electricity rationing. Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy company, DTEK, called the assault one of the most destructive to date. Ukraine&#x2019;s energy system has been repeatedly targeted since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war. Earlier strikes devastated coal, oil, and hydroelectric power plants, making the remaining nuclear facilities critical to the country&#x2019;s electricity supply. Greenpeace&#x2019;s analysis, which aligns with assessments from Ukrainian authorities, underscores the urgency of securing these vital energy resources.	https://kyivindependent.com/latest-strikes-on-ukraines-electricity-substations-threaten-power-failure-greenpeace-warns/	2024-11-20T06:13:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1239680001.jpg
Opinion: Europe’s 2% defense benchmark is an illusion, not a solution	With Donald Trump back in office, Europe faces a new era of uncertainty. The once-reliable comfort of American support &#x2014; a cornerstone of European security &#x2014; is now more in question than ever. For decades, Europe has assumed the U.S. would always be there to pick up the slack. But those days are over. Trump&apos;s administration openly questions NATO&#x2019;s role and views American involvement in European security with skepticism. Europe must now confront a new reality: it can no longer sit back, assuming the U.S. will handle its defense. Now is the time to act. Some in Europe may feel isolated in the challenge of supporting Ukraine, but this view underestimates Europe&#x2019;s own strength. The European Union is the world&#x2019;s largest trading bloc, one of the top three global economies, and home to four of the 10 largest economies on the planet. Russia, by comparison, ranks as the world&#x2019;s 11th largest economy &#x2014; its size comparable to Italy, with Spain not far behind. Europe&#x2019;s challenge is not a lack of resources, but the will to use them. Supporting Ukraine is not a cost; it&#x2019;s an investment in Europe&#x2019;s security and stability. The 2% GDP goal for NATO members was once a practical way to measure commitment to the alliance. But today, with threats evolving and new challenges emerging, that target is outdated. True security isn&#x2019;t about budget percentages; it&#x2019;s about capabilities &#x2014; about building a Europe that can defend itself and respond swiftly to crises. Russia&#x2019;s brutal assault on Ukraine has shown us that a spending target doesn&#x2019;t protect us &#x2014; actionable resources, modern defense systems, and readiness to act do. Europe has already seen this firsthand. Financial pledges to Ukraine are important, but on the ground, specific resources like anti-air systems, secure communications, and logistical support have made the difference. Europe now faces this same reality: leaders must move beyond symbolic spending goals and prioritize real capabilities to meet today&#x2019;s urgent security needs. Polish and Romanian military personnel stand next to military vehicles and a NATO flag on the sidelines of a press conference near the Suwalki Gap in Poland on July 7, 2022. (Wojtek Radwanski/AFP via Getty Images)Trump&#x2019;s return to office is Europe&#x2019;s wake-up call. The idea of &#x201C;strategic autonomy&#x201D; has circulated in policy circles for years, but Europe can no longer afford to keep it theoretical. Europe already has what it takes. It boasts a tier-one defense industry with advanced R&amp;D that rivals the capabilities of the U.S., China, and Russia. The talent, resources, and infrastructure are all in place. With the right focus, Europe&#x2019;s defense industry can deliver the advanced technologies and autonomous capabilities required to protect the continent. If Europe accelerates its initiatives, strategic autonomy can shift from a policy concept to a concrete reality. Ukraine&#x2019;s resistance to Russian aggression makes Europe&#x2019;s role in its defense indispensable, especially as American support becomes uncertain. Ukraine is not only defending its sovereignty but also the stability of Europe. This moment tests Europe&#x2019;s resolve &#x2014; not just in its support for Ukraine, but in its commitment to its own values and regional stability. Europe must act independently. The stakes are high: a retreat would hand Putin a critical advantage in his obsessive quest to redraw borders by force. The implications extend beyond Ukraine. With Trump&#x2019;s administration setting new precedents, other authoritarian states may be emboldened to challenge Europe. China, Iran, and others may interpret diminished U.S. involvement as an invitation to advance their interests in ways that threaten European stability. Europe&#x2019;s leaders must confront these growing risks, prepared to act decisively with or without U.S. backing. The lesson from Ukraine is stark: alliances are powerful, but self-reliance is essential for survival. Europe&#x2019;s defense future cannot be outsourced. This is a test of political will and unity. As Europe faces its greatest threat in a generation, it&#x2019;s time to rise to the occasion. The era of dependency is over &#x2014; our sovereignty demands it, our future depends on it. Europe has the talent, the resources, and the drive to make this vision a reality. The time has come for European leaders to adopt a security strategy that reflects the gravity of the moment. This isn&#x2019;t just about adapting to an unpredictable U.S. stance; it&#x2019;s about establishing a Europe that can defend itself, stand with Ukraine, and lead in a world of shifting alliances. Security isn&#x2019;t a budget line item; it&#x2019;s the bedrock of our shared European future and a free Ukraine. It&#x2019;s time to make it a priority.

Parliament backs bill to dissolve medical commissions in 1st reading after corruption scandals	The Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, supported a draft law on the elimination of the system of medical examination commissions (MSEC) for determining the severity of disabilities in the first reading on Nov. 20. President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a decree in October to liquidate the commissions in the wake of accusations of Ukrainian officials using corrupt schemes to acquire falsified disability certifications. A total of 260 members of parliament voted in favor of the bill, said Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a member of the Holos party. Obtaining disability status through medical examination commissions allows one to avoid military service and receive a higher pension, among other social benefits. The draft law&apos;s authors proposed replacing the system of medical examination commissions with &quot;an assessment of a person&apos;s daily functioning.&quot; &quot;The system of medical and social expertise that currently exists in Ukraine was formed before Ukraine gained independence. It does not meet the current challenges that our country faces during the armed aggression by the Russian Federation, nor the current approaches to establishing disability adopted in the world,&quot; the explanatory note to the draft law read. The draft law&apos;s authors expect that the new system will help create a transparent procedure for assessing the needs of the applicants. The replacement of commissions is expected to reduce the administrative burden and help reduce appeals against their decisions. Following the National Security and Defense Council meeting on Oct. 22, Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) head Vasyl Maliuk said that the SBU had exposed corruption schemes at medical examination commissions in 2024, resulting in the cancellation of 4,106 fake disability status certificates. Maliuk added that 64 officials at medical examination commissions have been charged with committing crimes, while another nine suspects have been convicted. According to Zelensky&apos;s October decree, all commissions in Ukraine are to be eliminated by Dec. 31, 2024. Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General Andrii Kostin submitted his resignation on Oct. 22 following the reports of prosecutors illegally obtaining disability status.	https://kyivindependent.com/parliament-bill-to-eliminate-medical-commissions/	2024-11-20T06:00:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170188731.jpg
Russia's FSB detains German citizen over alleged 'terrorist plot'	Russia&#x2019;s Federal Security Service (FSB) announced on Nov. 20 the detention of German citizen Nikolai Gaiduk, accusing him of planning terrorist attacks on energy infrastructure in the Kaliningrad region. Russia accused Gaiduk, a resident of Hamburg, Germany, of orchestrating the March 2024 bombing of a low-pressure gas distribution station in Kaliningrad using an improvised explosive device. The Kaliningrad region is Russia&apos;s heavily-armed exclave at the Baltic Sea coast, lodged between NATO members Poland and Lithuania. The FSB claims Gaiduk was detained after entering the Kaliningrad region from Poland, allegedly to conduct further sabotage. A search of his vehicle reportedly uncovered 0.5 liters of liquid explosive material. According to the FSB, Gaiduk received instructions and materials from Alexander (Oleksandr) Zhorov, a Ukrainian citizen residing in Hamburg. A criminal case has been opened against Gaiduk on terrorism and explosives smuggling charges. The independent Russian news outlet Agentstvo identified Gaiduk as a 57-year-old native of Ukraine who had lived in Konotop in Sumy Oblast before moving to Germany. The German Foreign Ministry said it is keeping itself informed but declined to comment on the allegations. The FSB announced on Nov. 19 the detention of two residents of Russian-occupied Crimea, accused of involvement in a Nov. 13 car bombing in Sevastopol that killed Russian Navy officer Valery Trankovsky.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-fsb-detains-german-citizen-over-alleged-terrorist-plot/	2024-11-20T05:45:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1249616715--1-.jpg
Germany delivers new military aid to Ukraine, including howitzers, Gepards	Germany has delivered fresh military aid to Ukraine, including four self-propelled Panzerhaubitze 2000 howitzers, three Gepard anti-aircraft guns, and more, the German government said on Nov. 20. Initially criticized for its sluggish delivery of military aid to Ukraine following the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Berlin has become the second-largest provider of military equipment after the U.S. Germany has handed over ammunition for infantry fighting vehicles Marder, 41,000 rounds of 155 mm ammunition, and several reconnaissance drones, including Vector, Hornet XR, Golden Eagle, VT-4 Rochen, Songbird, and others. Ukraine received medical equipment, 47 mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles (MRAP), seven howitzer tubes M109 155 mm, three mine clearing tanks Wisent 1, two bridge-laying tanks Beaver, as well as eight air assault vehicles Caracal. The tranche also included 340 precision rifles HLR 338 with 74,000 rounds of ammunition, 8,000 rounds of 40 mm ammunition, and 100,000 rounds of ammunition for firearms from Bundeswehr and industry stocks. According to an agreed-upon federal budget, Germany&apos;s military aid to Ukraine will be cut by half next year when compared to 2024. Berlin has allocated around 8 billion euros ($8.7 billion) to Kyiv in 2024, whereas the next year&apos;s support is currently set at 4 billion euros ($4.35 billion). Several media outlets reported on Nov. 17 that U.S. President Joe Biden permitted Ukraine to use its ATACMS missiles to strike against targets on Russian soil. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, in turn, is not planning to supply Ukraine with Taurus missiles despite the U.S. easing restrictions on long-range strikes. Berlin&apos;s policy may soon shift as Germany heads toward snap elections on Feb. 23, with the center-right opposition alliance CDU/CSU currently leading the polls and threatening to oust Scholz.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-military-aid/	2024-11-20T05:25:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1258715984.jpg
Russian officials threaten US over long-range strikes, allude to nuclear doctrine changes	Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Nov. 19 that Moscow &quot;will respond accordingly&quot; to Washington&apos;s permission for Ukraine to strike Russian soil with U.S. weapons. Speaking at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Lavrov referred to Russia&#x2019;s updated nuclear doctrine, which permits nuclear retaliation for attacks by non-nuclear states supported by nuclear powers. When asked during the summit if the U.S. had authorized Ukraine to use long-range weapons to target Russia, Lavrov responded, &quot;I don&#x2019;t know whether it&#x2019;s true or not. We are focused on ensuring our security.&quot; &quot;We have already stated everything necessary to those considering this, officially. The president said it, and now it&#x2019;s confirmed in an official document,&quot; he said, according to TASS. On Nov. 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin approved an updated nuclear deterrence policy that expands the conditions for a nuclear strike. The revised doctrine outlines scenarios that could justify a nuclear strike, suggesting that this could include &quot;aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies by a non-nuclear state with the support of a nuclear state&quot; and large-scale non-nuclear attacks. The alleged use of U.S. ATACMS missiles by Ukraine to strike Russia&#x2019;s Bryansk Oblast was reportedly the catalyst for Lavrov&apos;s remarks. &#xA0; Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chairman of Russia&apos;s Security Council known for his provocative and often extreme outbursts, also weighed in, threatening to use weapons of mass destruction against Ukraine and NATO. According to the official, the updated doctrine could qualify Ukraine&apos;s use of NATO-supplied missiles in Russia as a trigger for &quot;a mass retaliatory strike with weapons of mass destruction on Kyiv and main NATO facilities.&quot; &quot;This is already World War III,&quot; Medvedev wrote on his Telegram channel. Russia has repeatedly set supposed &quot;red lines&quot; on Western assistance for Ukraine, sometimes accompanied by veiled or overt nuclear threats. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock dismissed the Kremlin&apos;s blackmail, calling them a tactic to exploit the West&#x2019;s fears. The Pentagon stated there are no indications of Russia preparing to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine despite its revised nuclear doctrine. Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh called Russia&apos;s rhetoric &quot;irresponsible&quot; and consistent with its behavior over the past two years.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-officials-threaten-us-over-long-range-strikes-allude-to-nuclear-doctrine-changes/	2024-11-20T05:14:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1485172048.jpg
Russia strikes humanitarian aid distribution point in Kherson Oblast	Russian forces struck a humanitarian aid distribution point in Novodmytrivka, Kherson Oblast, on Nov. 20, the Kherson Regional Military Administration reported. The attack targeted a building where volunteers were distributing bread to residents, officials said. A projectile struck the roof, damaging windows, the facade, and the roof itself. No injuries were reported. A Russian drone also attempted to attack the volunteers&apos; vehicle, with the aircraft striking near the car, the administration said. Novodmytrivka lies in the Ukraine-held part of Kherson Oblast, less than 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of the regional center, Kherson. Across Ukraine, Russian attacks over the past day killed at least two people and injured 30, according to local authorities. In Kherson Oblast, 21 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, came under fire. The attacks killed two people and injured 15 others, the military administration reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-strikes-humanitarian-aid-distribution-point-in-kherson-oblast/	2024-11-20T04:23:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/466747406_960061486155681_8414494342139342985_n.jpg
Russian forces attack 10 times per day as they push toward Kurakhove, military says	The Russian military conducts up to 10 assaults daily in an attempt to approach the town of Kurakhove in Donetsk Oblast, Oleksandr Nevidomyi, spokesperson of the 46th Airmobile Brigade, told Suspilne on Nov. 20. Russia is carrying out intense attacks in multiple sections of the eastern front, with attempts to break through Ukraine&apos;s defenses in Donetsk Oblast toward the towns of Kurakhove and Pokrovsk. &quot;Every day, there can be up to 10 assaults, both by infantry groups and armored vehicles. There are also attempts to cross the river (Vovcha) on rubber boats,&quot; Nevidomyi said. The Ukrainian serviceman added that Russian forces are actively using kamikaze drones, particularly to drop ammunition from a height. The estimated Russian advance near Kurakhove, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Nov. 19, 2024, according to the DeepState monitoring group. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)According to Nevidomyi, the Russian military is based north of Kurakhove at a high altitude, from where they launch drones to attack Ukrainian positions and logistics. &quot;And, of course, Russian artillery does not stop working,&quot; he added. &quot;They (the Russian military) are recovering. They are getting new troops who are training at the training ground. They have no problems with people, they have a lot of them.&quot; Russian forces damaged the dam holding the Kurakhove Reservoir in Donetsk Oblast on Nov. 11, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Russian forces also claimed to have taken the front-line village of Novoselydivka, which lies some 7 kilometers (4 miles) north of Kurakhove, on Nov. 19. Ukraine has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified. The Russian advance in Ukraine&apos;s east has picked up a long-unseen pace in the past few months, with outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian defenders steadily forced to retreat. The U.S. election victory of Donald Trump adds to the uncertainties, casting a shadow on Ukraine&apos;s ability to hold back Russian forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-conduct-up-to-10-assaults-daily-near-kurakhove-military-says/	2024-11-20T04:12:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158420470.jpg
Carmaker forecasts 30% collapse in Russian car market by 2025	Sales of new cars and light commercial vehicles in Russia could decline by 21-30% in 2025 if high interest rates persist, Avtovaz CEO Maxim Sokolov said on Nov. 19, according to the state-owned TASS news agency. Sokolov attributed the anticipated decline to customers diverting savings from car purchases to bank deposits due to elevated interest rates. Russia&apos;s central bank raised its key interest rate to 21% in October, its highest level since 2003, aiming to curb inflation caused by massive wartime spending to meet its 2026 target. &quot;This will undoubtedly have a negative impact on the market and production plans in the medium term,&quot; he said, warning that Avtovaz&#x2019;s current production levels will not be sustainable under such economic conditions. The state-owned Avtovaz is Russia&apos;s largest carmaker, best known for its flagship Lada vehicle series. The high rates are not only affecting the automotive sector but also threatening Russia&#x2019;s broader economy. Izvestia reported on Nov. 13 that about 30 Russian airlines, responsible for 26% of domestic passenger traffic, are at risk of bankruptcy in 2025 due to economic pressures.	https://kyivindependent.com/carmaker-forecasts-30-collapse-in-russian-car-market-by-2025/	2024-11-20T03:24:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-454250652.jpg
Parliament passes bills on military service, including draft deferral for civilians released from captivity	The Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, passed several bills on Nov. 20 changing the mobilization rules for some of the citizens who had suffered due to Russian aggression. Ukrainian authorities have been revising the legal framework for military service to make mobilization processes more equitable as the grueling war continues for almost three years. The Verkhovna Rada passed bills that grant the right to defer mobilization to civilians who have been released from Russian captivity, as well as the right to discharge from service to those military personnel whose step-family members were killed or went missing in the war. The key change is that military personnel are now granted the right to be released from service after the death or disappearance of their half-siblings. The parliament also passed a draft law to clarify rules for a draft deferral to people whose close relatives were killed or went missing while participating in hostilities. The purpose of the bill is to eliminate &quot;legal uncertainty&quot; regarding the grounds for granting a deferral from military service during mobilization to women and men whose close relatives were killed or went missing during the war. The draft law proposes that women and men whose close relatives were killed or went missing under &quot;special circumstances&quot; or during hostilities provoked by Russian aggression could receive a deferral. Earlier, secretary of the parliamentary defense committee Roman Kostenko said the Defense Ministry planned to finalize the bill defining the procedure and conditions for discharging military personnel from service by Dec. 18 this year. Ukraine&apos;s parliament adopted an updated mobilization law in mid-April to ramp up mobilization amid Russia&apos;s ongoing war. The new law simplifies the process for identifying eligible conscripts and includes additional penalties for those dodging the draft. The parliament voted to remove provisions on demobilization, which previously foresaw soldiers having the right to leave the military after 36 months of service, from the bill so that they could be considered separately. The parliament obliged the Defense Ministry to develop a relevant draft law within eight months.	https://kyivindependent.com/parliament-bills-military-service/	2024-11-20T03:12:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178721575.jpg
Sweden investigating Chinese ship's possible role in Baltic Sea cable damage, FT reports	Swedish authorities are investigating damage to two communication cables in the Baltic Sea and whether the Chinese cargo ship Yi Peng 3 may have been involved, the Financial Times reported on Nov. 20, citing undisclosed sources. Data from maritime tracking group MarineTraffic shows the Yi Peng 3, traveling from Russia to Egypt, passed near the Swedish-Lithuanian and Finnish-German cables on Nov. 17 and Nov. 18, the dates the cables were damaged. The Swedish government has declined to publicly comment specifically on the ship but confirmed that a police investigation, supported by the Coast Guard and the Armed Forces, is underway. The Yi Peng 3 is owned by the Ningbo Yipeng Shipping company based near Ningbo in eastern China. A company spokesperson confirmed to the Financial Times that the Chinese government had asked the company to cooperate with the investigation but declined to provide further details. Telecom cables linking two Nordic countries with Germany and Lithuania were cut at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, raising suspicion of sabotage, various media outlets reported on Nov. 18. This incident comes a little more than two years after unknown actors blew up the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, as well as amid mounting warnings of Russian hybrid and sabotage operations across Western countries, namely in the Baltic Sea region. China is Russia&apos;s leading geopolitical partner, and NATO countries have accused Beijing of directly supporting Moscow&apos;s war of aggression in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/sweden-investigates-chinese-ship-possible-role-in-baltic-sea-cable-damage/	2024-11-20T02:44:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182217094--1-.jpg
Putin is weaker than US' — Zelensky outlines US role in ending war in Ukraine	The end of the war in Ukraine depends more on the United States than on Russia, as the Russian president &quot;is weaker,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with Fox News published on Nov. 19. Zelensky talked to the U.S. outlet when Ukraine marked the 1,000th day of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The milestone comes as the U.S. military aid to Ukraine is in question as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office in January. Answering the question of whether Putin is the person who can decide to end the war, Zelensky said that a lot depends on the Russian president but even more on the U.S. &quot;I&apos;m sure that, as of today, it depends on Putin, really a lot. He can do that. He can be willing and end this war,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;But it also depends on the U.S. much more. Putin is weaker than the U.S. The U.S. president has the strength, authority, and weapons, and he can decrease the price of energy resources. By the way, I heard the signal in the media from President Trump that he is thinking of decreasing the prices for energy resources, for oil, and it is needed to be done.&quot; Zelensky also believes that Trump will be able to influence Putin to end the war, although it will not be &quot;simple.&quot; The Ukrainian president added that Trump is &quot;stronger&quot; than Putin, as is the U.S. &quot;He&apos;s stronger. The U.S. is stronger. The economy is stronger. The U.S. has a very big influence.&quot; Zelensky suggested that Ukraine risks losing the war if aid from the new U.S. administration is cut. &quot;Of course, anyway, we will stay, and we will fight. We have production, but it&apos;s not enough to prevail. And I think it is not enough to survive.&quot; During the campaign, Trump promised to end Russia&apos;s war with Ukraine if elected, saying in September that he would negotiate a deal &quot;that&apos;s good for both sides.&quot; Trump also said he had not spoken with Putin but added: &quot;I think we&apos;ll speak.&quot; Trump&apos;s election has intensified uncertainty around Ukraine&apos;s war efforts at a critical time, as Russian forces make their fastest gains in months and North Korean troops are stationed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Zelensky was among the first to congratulate the president-elect, who had criticized the extent of U.S. military and financial aid to Kyiv during his campaign and pledged to end the war swiftly without providing details on how he would achieve this.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-is-weaker-than-us-zelensky-says/	2024-11-20T02:23:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2176416230-1.jpg
North Korean troops in Russia to be led by secrecy-shrouded general close to Kim Jong Un, WSJ reports	Colonel General Kim Yong Bok, one of the generals accompanying North Korean troops in Russia, is a mystery-shrouded figure close to dictator Kim Jong Un, The Wall Street Journal reported on Nov. 20. Kim Yong Bok, officially the Deputy Chief of the Army General Staff, is expected to oversee the integration of North Korean troops into Russian forces, gain combat experience, and establish a framework for future deployments, the outlet reports. A Ukrainian envoy listed him, along with Major General Sin Kum Cheol and Colonel General Ri Chang Ho, during a U.N. Security Council meeting on Oct. 30 as one of the generals commanding some over 10,000 North Korean troops in Russia. Kim&#x2019;s role in Pyongyang&#x2019;s military has long been shrouded in secrecy. He previously commanded a special forces unit of 200,000 soldiers tasked with covert missions on the Korean Peninsula. His profile was elevated after Russian President Vladimir Putin visited North Korea in June, with reports identifying him as the No. 3 figure in the Korean People&apos;s Army, according to the Wall Street Journal&apos;s reporting. In July 2020, Kim was seen alongside Kim Jong Un at a ceremony honoring military officials but largely disappeared from public view until recently. This deployment coincides with North Korea&#x2019;s formalized mutual defense treaty with Russia, announced on Nov. 12. The agreement obligates the nations to assist each other in the event of an armed attack. The development follows reports of initial clashes between Ukrainian forces and North Korean troops in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. The Western countries denounced the deployment of North Korean troops as an escalation, with the U.S. reportedly responding by permitting Ukraine to launch ATACMS missiles against Russian and North Korean troops amassing in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/kim-yong-bok/	2024-11-20T01:45:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1125139920.jpg
Putin open to discussing Ukraine ceasefire with Trump, Reuters reports	Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump but rejects major territorial concessions and insists that Ukraine abandon plans to join NATO, Reuters reported on Nov. 20. For the first time, five current and former Russian officials outlined to Reuters the Kremlin&#x2019;s potential terms for a Trump-brokered peace deal. These could include freezing the conflict &quot;broadly&quot; along current front lines and &quot;dividing control&quot; of eastern regions, including the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts. Moscow, which illegally declared annexation of these regions in September 2022, currently controls only 70-80% of them, with approximately 26,000 square kilometers (10,000 square miles) under Ukrainian control. Putin issued a demand in June that Ukraine must withdraw from the four regions completely before any ceasefire talks. Russia currently occupies roughly a fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory &#x2013; including Crimea &#x2013; as its forces continue to steadily advance in the east. Publicly, the Kremlin has rejected freezing the front line or any concessions on its part, with Putin saying any peace deal must be in Moscow&apos;s favor. According to Reuters, Russian officials suggested that Moscow might consider withdrawing from smaller occupied areas in Ukraine&#x2019;s Kharkiv and Mykolaiv regions but emphasized that any deal must reflect &quot;realities&quot; on the ground. Moscow remains firmly opposed to NATO membership for Ukraine or the presence of foreign troops on Ukrainian soil, the officials said. Additional demands could reportedly include limiting Ukraine&#x2019;s military size and guaranteeing unrestricted use of the Russian language. Ukraine has rejected territorial concessions and said any peace talks should be based on its 10-point peace formula, which includes a Russian withdrawal and full territorial integrity and sovereignty. Officials acknowledged that some territories might be returned through diplomacy rather than military means. Kyiv also said that NATO membership is the only way to prevent further Russian aggression. Without a ceasefire, Russia will continue the war, Kremlin sources told Reuters. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the U.S. authorization of ATACMS missiles a &quot;very dangerous escalation.&quot; Trump has positioned himself as a potential peace broker, claiming he could negotiate an end to the war. The contours of Trump&apos;s peace plan remain unclear, though media reports indicate it might entail postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership for 20 years, freezing the front line, and establishing a demilitarized zone in the east manned by European troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-trump-ceasefire/	2024-11-20T01:01:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-872780694.jpg

Ukrainian drones allegedly strike Russian factories, weapons arsenal	Ukraine reportedly targeted Russian facilities with drones as the Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Nov. 20 that air defense forces shot down 44 drones overnight. Belgorod Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said that drone wreckage damaged the premises of an enterprise in the town of Alekseevka on Nov. 19. Media reports identified the facility as an EFKO plant, officially a sauce manufacturer. Separately, drone strikes were reported also in Voronezh Oblast, with local authorities claiming that five drones struck a civilian industrial facility, starting a fire. The Voronezh and Belgorod oblasts lie at the border with Ukraine and are regularly targeted in cross-border drone strikes. Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&#x2019;s National Security and Defense Council&apos;s counter-disinformation center, said that the EFKO plant also secretly produces cargo drones used by the Russian military. The official said that Ukrainian drones also attacked the 13th Arsenal of the Main Missile and Artillery Directorate of Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry (GRAU) near Kotovo in Novgorod Oblast, some 680 kilometers (420 miles) from Ukraine&#x2019;s border. According to Kovalenko, the arsenal stores critical military supplies, including artillery shells, multiple-launch rocket system (MLRS) missiles, Iskander and anti-aircraft missiles, and ammunition for various systems, including the Tor complex. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed that 22 drones were shot down over Novgorod Oblast overnight. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage that purports to show drone strike against Voronezh Oblast, Russia, overnight on Nov. 20, 2024.

These strikes come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced plans on Nov. 19 to scale up domestic production of long-range drones and missiles. As part of Ukraine&#x2019;s resilience plan, the country aims to manufacture at least 30,000 long-range drones in the coming year and establish a new technology center to enhance its defense capabilities. Ukrainian forces struck a military arsenal in Karachev, Bryansk Oblast, overnight on Nov. 19, with some reports indicating that Kyiv deployed U.S. ATACMS missiles for the first time on Russian soil.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-russia-factory-weapons-arsenal/	2024-11-19T23:42:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2165561187.jpg
Biden reportedly approves delivery of anti-personnel mines to Ukraine in light of Russian gains in east	U.S. President Joe Biden approved the provision of anti-personnel mines to Ukraine, which is expected to help slow down Russia&apos;s advance in the east of the country, the Washington Post (WP) and several other outlets reported on Nov. 19, citing undisclosed U.S. officials. The move follows the Biden administration&apos;s authorization of the use of U.S.-made long-range missiles to strike Russian territory. Kyiv has not officially confirmed the claims, but recent reports indicate Ukraine deployed U.S. ATACMS missiles in Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast. The transfer of anti-personnel mines could be controversial, as it contradicts the Ottawa Convention, also known as the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Treaty, which has been signed by more than 160 countries. Russia and the U.S. are not signatories to this initiative. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Washington has been supplying Kyiv with anti-tank mines, while Ukrainian forces have been looking for opportunities to obtain infantry mines over the past three years. Moscow has used anti-personnel mines without restriction at the front line, hampering the progress of the Ukrainian military. Biden was reluctant to supply Ukraine with mines due to doubts in his administration and the risk to civilians. Yet Washington is now concerned about Russia&apos;s rapid advance in eastern Ukraine and sees the need to halt it, U.S. officials told the WP. &quot;Russia is attacking Ukrainian lines in the east with waves of troops, regardless of the casualties that they&apos;re suffering,&quot; one of the officials said. &quot;So, the Ukrainians are obviously taking losses, and more towns and cities are at risk of falling. These mines were made specifically to combat exactly this.&quot; One U.S. official described the mines for Ukraine as &quot;non-resistant,&quot; meaning that they self-destruct or lose battery power to render them inactive within days or weeks, reducing the danger to civilians, the WP reported. The official said Kyiv had committed to not installing these mines in densely populated areas.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-anti-personnel-mines-to-ukraine/	2024-11-19T23:16:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1903200714.jpg
No signs Russia is preparing to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Pentagon says	The Pentagon said on Nov. 19 that while Russia has updated its nuclear doctrine, there are no indications that it is preparing to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh dismissed Russia&#x2019;s rhetoric surrounding its nuclear policy as a continuation of its behavior over the past two years. The comments came shortly after Russia updated its nuclear doctrine, lowering the threshold for a nuclear retaliation in an open warning to the West. &quot;It&#x2019;s the same irresponsible rhetoric that we&#x2019;ve seen before,&quot; Singh said. &quot;We&#x2019;re going to continue to monitor, but we don&#x2019;t have any indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon within Ukraine.&quot; The spokesperson stressed that Russia&apos;s involvement of troops from a third country marks a clear escalation. According to her, the administration warned Moscow that if North Korean troops were deployed, the United States would help Ukraine respond and &quot;provide Ukraine with what it needs.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin approved updates to Russia&#x2019;s nuclear deterrence policy, which were published on a government website on Nov. 19.The revised doctrine expands scenarios justifying a nuclear strike, including &quot;aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies by a non-nuclear state with the support of a nuclear state&quot; and large-scale non-nuclear attacks, such as those involving drones.	https://kyivindependent.com/pentagon-russia-nuclear-weapons/	2024-11-19T23:00:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1459767214.jpg
US Embassy in Kyiv warns of 'potential significant' Russian aerial attack on Nov. 20	The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said it had received &quot;specific information&quot; about a possible major Russian aerial attack on Nov. 20, urging U.S. citizens to be ready to take shelter. &quot;Out of an abundance of caution, the Embassy will be closed, and Embassy employees are being instructed to shelter in place,&quot; the statement read. The warning comes shortly after Russia launched one of its largest combined missile and drone attacks on Nov. 17, firing 210 drones and missiles. Russia has ramped up the frequency of its drone strikes against Ukraine over the past few months, with air raid alerts sounding off in the capital nearly on a daily basis. As a result of an overnight drone attack on Nov. 20, debris fell in the Dniprovskyi district of Kyiv, starting a fire, officials reported. Moscow&apos;s forces also launched a number of deadly attacks against Ukrainian cities and towns in the past week, including Odesa, Sumy, and Hlukhiv in Sumy Oblast. Six &#xA0;Russian missile carriers capable of launching Kalibr cruise missiles are currently delpoyed in the Black Sea, the Navy warned in the morning.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-embassy-in-kyiv-warns/	2024-11-19T22:31:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1221111502.jpg

Increasing number of Ukrainians favor peace talks, poll suggests	As attitudes around potential future peace negotiations continue to shift in Ukraine, 52% of Ukrainians now say that they would like to see their country negotiate an end to the war &quot;as soon as possible,&quot; according to a survey published by Gallup on Nov. 19. The survey, released ahead of the anticipated harsh winter months amid Russian energy attacks, highlights that approximately 10% to 12% of Ukraine&apos;s population living in Russian-occupied territories were excluded from the poll. The poll, released on the 1,000th day of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, indicates a progressive shift in sentiments surrounding the end of the war, with only about four in ten, 38%, respondents saying that the country should &quot;continue fighting until it wins the war.&quot; In 2022, following the start of the all-out war, a record 73% of respondents believed Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins, dropping to 63% in 2023, according to Gallup&apos;s finding. The shift represents a 25 percentage point decrease year-over-year between 2023 and 2024. The poll, which did not ask about details regarding a timeline for negotiations, falls in contrast with another survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) released on Nov. 4 that showed that 63% of Ukrainians ready to endure the war as long as necessary. Among those surveyed in the Gallup poll who would be open negotiating peace as soon as possible, 52% would be open to making territorial concessions as part of a peace deal with 38% against concessions &#x2014; though the specifics of the potential territorial concessions were not outlined in the survey. The responses to the survey likely fall in line with comments made by President-elect Donald Trump, who pledged to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine &quot;within 24 hours.&quot; Mike Waltz, Trump&apos;s pick for a national security advisor, told Voice of America on Nov. 13 that Trump wants to bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table to end the war. The change in sentiment is also likely reflected in comments made by Ukrainian officials over the past year. Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksandr Lytvynenko said in May that Ukraine &quot;clearly understands&quot; that Russia&apos;s full-scale war will end with negotiations. President Volodymyr Zelensky has more recently said that the country must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means in 2025, adding that a war would &quot;end faster&quot; under a Trump administration. Support for an immediate end to the war through negotiations is most popular among Ukraine&apos;s front-line eastern regions, with just 27% of respondents in Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk, and Kharkiv oblasts saying that Kyiv should continue to fight until it wins the war &#x2014; down from 63% in 2022. Despite Trump&apos;s insistence on quickly settling the war, 70% of respondents most trust European Union countries to play a significant role in a potential negotiated peace, with only 49% of supportive of the United States under a Trump administration having a significant role. A further 63% of respondents were in favor of having the United Kingdom play a significant role. The Gallup poll involved approximately 1,000 Ukrainian adults from all regions of the country and has a margin of error of 3 percentage points 19 times out of 20.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-poll/	2024-11-19T22:07:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/peace-summit.jpg
US to announce $275 million military aid package to Ukraine, AP reports	The U.S. is preparing to announce a military aid package for Ukraine worth about $275 million, the Associated Press (AP) reported on Nov. 19, citing U.S. officials. The latest aid package comes as the Biden administration rushes to deliver the remaining approximately $7 billion in military aid to Ukraine ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, amid concerns that a future Trump administration would halt weapons shipments before they reach Kyiv. Two administration officials told Politico on Nov. 6 that the White House plans to expedite the weapons delivery ahead of the January 2025 inauguration, as Trump has previously said he would cease military aid to Ukraine unless it agrees to hold peace negotiations with Russia. The new aid package will include HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) ammunition, artillery shells, and Javelin surface-to-air missiles, in addition to a wide range of spare parts and equipment, according to officials. The new aid package, which is expected to be announced this week, will be provided under presidential drawdown authority, pulling weaponry from existing U.S. stockpiles. The U.S. most recently announced the delivery of a $425 million military aid package for Kyiv on Nov. 1. Despite the president&apos;s ability to deliver existing weapons stocks through presidential drawdown authority, White House officials are concerned that the delivery of the large amount of undelivered weapons may take months to reach Ukraine &#x2014; well past Trump&apos;s inauguration into office. President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 30 said the U.S. has transferred to Ukraine only about 10% of the $61 billion aid approved by Congress in April 2024. Of the $61 billion aid package, only $4.3 billion remains to pull existing weapons stocks, while a further $2.1 billion in funding remains to put weapons on contract with U.S. defense companies. The latest military aid package comes amid a significant shift in U.S. policy as President Joe Biden authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles for strikes inside Russia on Nov. 17. Ukraine reportedly used ATACMS to strike Russian territory for first time on Nov. 19, striking a Russian military facility in Karachev, Bryansk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-announce-275-million-military-aid-package-to-ukraine-ap-reports/	2024-11-19T19:17:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184603402.jpg
Russia behind recent bomb threats at Czech, Slovak schools, Czech intelligence chief says	Michal Koudelka, the director of the Czech Security Information Service, said on Nov. 18 that Russia was behind a flurry of bomb threats made against schools in Czechia and Slovakia in recent months. Intelligence agencies across Europe have warned that Russia is plotting violent acts of sabotage across the continent in response to countries&apos; support for Ukraine. Hundreds of Czech and Slovak schools received bomb threats sent over email after schools returned from their summer break in September, leading to multiple school closures, local media reported. Following the threat, local police found no credible evidence of explosives or improvised devices surrounding the schools. &quot;There is a clearly visible Russian trace&quot; concerning the bomb threat, Koudelka told Czech parliamentarians during a briefing on the threats posed by Russian cyberattacks to the country&apos;s national security. Russia has long engaged in a variety of disruptive behavior toward Europe, also using its cyber capabilities to target civilian infrastructure. Prague has regularly been targeted by Russia through cyberattacks beginning in 2023. At a conference in Prague on Oct. 9, Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said that Moscow is responsible for 80% of all the foreign influence operations in the world. Ahead of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Czechia authorities expelled 18 Russian diplomats in response to deadly 2014 warehouse blast that Russia was reportedly responsible for. Various media outlets reported on Nov. 18 that several Telecom cables linking two Nordic countries with Germany and Lithuania were cut at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, raising suspicion of Russian sabotage.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-behind-recent-bomb-threats-at-czech-slovak-schools-czech-intelligence-chief-says/	2024-11-19T18:21:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169317481.jpg
Poland signs deal with domestic companies to kickstart ammunition production	Poland has signed a letter of intent with domestic companies to begin producing nitrocellulose and multi-base powders essential for ammunition manufacturing, according to a Polish government report published on Nov. 18. This marks a significant step in rebuilding Poland&apos;s ammunition production capabilities, which currently rely on imports from several European countries and Canada. The government plans to invest 3 billion zlotys ($750 million) to enhance ammunition production, in response to observations from Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine. &quot;No one who observes the war in Ukraine and other conflicts in the world today can have any doubts about how important it is to have access to a large amount of ammunition for modern weapons,&quot; Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said. State-owned companies, including Grupa Azoty and PGZ, agree on the need to establish a factory for the development of these materials. PGZ board member Marcin Idzik highlighted the need to produce 155mm artillery rounds, to prepare for potential future conflicts involving NATO. Poland has been one of the strongest supporters of Ukraine since the start of all-out war in February 2022, providing billions of dollars in military, economic, and humanitarian aid and hosting millions of Ukrainian refugees. The country has also been a vocal supporter of Ukraine on the world stage, campaigning for Ukraine to receive all the required weaponry to win the war that Russia had begun.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-signs-deal-with-domestic-companies-to-kickstart-ammunition-production/	2024-11-19T16:43:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1242568859.jpg
Ukrnafta acquires 51% share in Shell's gas station network in Ukraine	Ukrnafta, a state-owned oil and gas extraction company that is a subsidiary of Naftogaz, has bought a 51% stake in Shell&apos;s gas station network in Ukraine, the press service of Naftogaz reported on Nov. 19. Ukrnafta will now hold a majority stake in a network of 118 operational gas stations. Shell, one of Ukraine&#x2019;s top 10 fuel networks, ranks number 9 in fuel sales and number 7 in station numbers, with most stations located in high-traffic areas. All 1,550 employees will keep their jobs, and rebranding is set to be completed within a year. According to Oleksiy Chernyshov, CEO of Naftogaz Group, the profits from this business will be directed to the national budget as dividends. Natural gas production in Ukraine in October increased to the highest level since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, exploration and production consulting company EXPRO reported on its website on Nov. 6. According to EXPRO&#x2019;s calculations, gross natural gas production rose by 2.3% in October 2024 compared to the same month last year, reaching 1.663 billion cubic meters, the highest level since January 2022. Ukraine&#x2019;s gas production also grew by 2% this year, while daily production rates rose by 1.3%.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrnafta-acquires-51-share-in-shells-gas-station-network-in-ukraine/	2024-11-19T15:16:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1153940142.jpg
Ukraine beats Albania 2:1, earns chance to advance to Nations League top tier	The Ukraine national football team scored two goals to Albania&apos;s one, earning the second-place spot in the Nations League&apos;s Group B1. Ukraine&apos;s Oleksandr Zinchenko opened the score on the 5th minute after a shot from outside the box. Five minutes later, Roman Yaremchuk doubled the score. Despite having eight shots on target compared to Albania&apos;s two, the ending was tense following a successfully converted penalty by Nedim Bajrami on the 75th minute. Ukraine struggled through the tournament, losing the first two games of the group stage to Albania and the Czech Republic. Following a victory over Georgia and two draws with the Czech Republic and Georgia, Ukraine found a chance to avoid finishing last in the group.Following the victory over Albania and the Czech win over Georgia, Ukraine secured second place with 8 points. Ukraine now awaits a future draw that will pair it with the third-placed team from one of the tournament&apos;s top-tier groups for a chance at promotion. The UEFA Nations League is a tournament held every two years in between the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship for national teams to be in shape for major tournaments. The league is divided into four tiers, with Ukraine currently competing in the second one and having a chance to return to the top one after a four-year gap.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-beats-albania-2-1-earns-chance-to-advance-to-nations-league-top-tier/	2024-11-19T14:01:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185013367.jpg
UK, Germany, Canada, Luxembourg announce additional $30 million for drone coalition funding	Multiple drone coalition countries have pledged additional funding to support Ukraine with strike and reconnaissance drones, the U.K. government website reported on Nov. 19. The contributors include the U.K. with $9.5 million, Germany with $12.7 million, and Canada and Luxembourg, each providing $3.8 million. The overall fund has surpassed $85 million, with $19 million of the funds coming from the U.K. The coalition, co-led by Latvia and the UK, was launched on February 17, 2024, to strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s drone capabilities. The coalition was established to bolster Ukraine&apos;s arsenal of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Seven countries, apart from the founding states, have joined the alliance, including Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Sweden, Estonia, and Denmark. Ukraine is also working to scale up domestic production, aiming to produce at least 1 million drones in 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-germany-canada-luxembourg-announce-additional-30-million-for-drone-coalition-funding/	2024-11-19T13:35:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2068302945.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine reportedly uses ATACMS on Russian territory for first time; Zelensky presents resilience plan	Key developments on Nov. 19: The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Nov. 19 that Ukraine launched U.S.-made ATACMS missiles against Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast, according to the state news agency TASS. This coincides with several Ukrainian media outlets reporting that, according to undisclosed military sources, Ukraine successfully struck a Russian military facility in Karachev, Bryansk Oblast. If confirmed, this would mark the first instance of Ukraine using U.S.-made long-range missiles on Russian territory since Washington eased the restrictions last week. Kyiv&apos;s forces have previously deployed the weaponry only against Russian targets in occupied Ukrainian territories. The claims could not be independently verified. A Ukrainian military representative declined to comment on the reports for the Kyiv Independent. Ukrainian officials previously reported an attack with unspecified weaponry against a Russian arsenal in Karachev overnight on Nov. 19, which reportedly stored artillery ammunition, including North Korean munitions, KAB guided bombs, anti-aircraft missiles, and rocket launcher ammunition. Twelve secondary explosions could be heard at around 2:30 a.m., the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. Karachev residents reported explosions and detonations, including an alleged attack on a &quot;military base,&quot; as shared in local chats and reported by Russian media outlet Astra. The town lies more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the Ukrainian border. ATACMS missiles have a maximum range of 300 kilometers (190 miles). In turn, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed that its forces shot down five and damaged one ATACMS missile. Missile fragments fell on a military facility in Bryansk Oblast and started a fire but inflicted &quot;no casualties or damage,&quot; the ministry claimed. Unnamed U.S. officials, as well as a source familiar with the decision, who spoke to Reuters following the decision earlier this week, said that Kyiv plans to conduct its first long-range strikes in the coming days. Commenting on the reports, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the &quot;missiles will speak for themselves.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky unveiled Ukraine&apos;s 10-point plan for internal resilience in an address to the parliament on Nov. 19. &quot;Ukraine may need to outlive someone in Moscow to achieve all the goals,&quot; Zelensky said, according to lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&apos;s Telegram channel. &quot;We do not trade security or sovereignty. We will not give up our rights to our entire territory.&quot; The resilience plan follows some criticism Zelensky received after presenting a victory plan this fall that primarily focused on requests from external partners and lacked domestic reforms. &quot;While the whole world is waiting for a miracle from Trump, God willing, we should get to work,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Ukraine may need to outlive someone in Moscow to achieve all the goals,&quot; Zelensky said. The individual points of the new resilience plan were focused on the country&apos;s unity, front-line situation, arms, finances, energy, security, communities, human capital, cultural sovereignty, and veterans, according to Zhelezniak&apos;s Telegram channel. In his presentation to parliament, Zelensky emphasized he is not preparing to lower the mobilization age. Instead, he called for new approaches to management, establishing a military ombudsman, and creating a new contract system for citizens below the age of mobilization. With Ukraine facing sharp manpower shortages, Zelensky has come under pressure both from citizens at home and from U.S. lawmakers abroad to reduce the age of mobilization. Zelensky also said that Ukraine will produce at least 30,000 long-range drones next year, and noted that Ukraine has already struck targets using their domestically-produced Neptune cruise missiles. In his speech, he set a goal of producing 3,000 cruise missiles. For veterans, Zelensky proposed new efforts to recruit veterans for public service, creating rehabilitation centers in every community in 2025, introducing 11,000 veteran support specialists in the next year, providing supplementary payments to family physicians treating veterans, and establishing dedicated veteran housing. Financial aspects of the plan included deregulation, insuring military risks, and increased security for businesses from law enforcement pressures. Zelensky also proposed a cultural &quot;Ramstein&quot; to reinforce and export Ukraine culture abroad, including helping to establish Ukrainian studies departments in foreign universities. In regards to unity, Zelensky reportedly restated that the country will not hold any elections until martial law is lifted, and said that further aspects of the plan will be developed in detail in coordination with civil society members, business leaders, and experts. Russian forces claim to have taken the front-line village of Novoselydivka in Donetsk Oblast on Nov. 19. Ukraine has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified. Novoselydivka lies some 7 kilometers (4 miles) north of Kurakhove, an important stronghold of Ukrainian forces in the area that has seen increasingly heavy Russian assaults in the past months. If confirmed, this will be the latest village that the Russian forces took in their attempt to encircle Kurakhove by driving their forces towards Konstiantynopil with a north-south pincer movement. With the best Ukrainian brigades holding Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Russian troops move forward along the Donetsk front line at a rate not seen since the early weeks of the war. The victory of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in early November adds further uncertainty to Kyiv&apos;s military prospects to hold its defenses across the 1,200-kilometer-long (750 miles) front line as doubt over Washington&apos;s future military aid looms. Outgoing President Joe Biden&apos;s decision to allow Ukraine to use Western-supplied ATACMS to strike targets deep inside Russia may help in the short run but will not change the general course of the war, observers said. Russian President Vladimir Putin approved updated principles of Russia&apos;s nuclear deterrence policy, according to a presidential decree published on a government website on Nov. 19. The revised doctrine outlines scenarios that could justify a nuclear strike. It implies that this could include &quot;aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies by a non-nuclear state with the support of a nuclear state&quot; and large-scale non-nuclear attacks, such as those carried out with drones. Putin first proposed changes to the nuclear doctrine during a Sept. 25 Security Council meeting on nuclear deterrence. He claimed that Russia does not need a preventative strike as part of its nuclear doctrine &quot;because, in a retaliatory strike, the enemy will be guaranteed to be destroyed.&quot; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the changes should be seen as a &quot;certain signal&quot; to the West. &quot;This is a signal that warns these countries of the consequences if they take part in an attack on our country by various means, not necessarily nuclear,&quot; Peskov told the state-run RIA Novosti on Sept. 26. Since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has repeatedly issued nuclear threats against Ukraine and the West. The threats have failed to materialize, and Russia continues to wage its all-out war without using its nuclear arsenal. More than 50,000 Ukrainian recruits have undergone training in the U.K. as part of the British-led Operation Interflex since June 2022, the U.K. Defense Ministry announced on Nov. 19. &quot;Kosovo, Romania, and Estonia are the latest nations to join this global effort, standing united for freedom and resilience,&quot; the Defense Ministry said on X. The project, also supported by 10 other partner countries, including Canada, New Zealand, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Lithuania, the Netherlands, and Australia, provides essential military training to Ukrainian recruits at various facilities. Operation Interflex, led by the U.K., is one of the key programs aimed at preparing Ukrainian troops to defend against Russian aggression. Ukrainian service members have also been receiving military training under other initiatives led either by national governments of partner countries or the EU. British soldiers have been warned that Russia may be using spies and drones to gather intelligence on Ukrainian service members trained in the U.K., according to a report by The Times on Aug. 5. Denmark will allocate 130 million euros ($137.5 million) for the development of the Ukrainian defense industry, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announced on Nov. 19 during a joint press briefing with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Frederiksen came to Kyiv on Nov. 19 in a surprise visit and met Zelensky on the 1,000th day of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;It is important to me that our own industry, not only in Denmark but in all neighboring countries, can visit Ukraine and learn from your experience and your ability to expand and develop your production lines,&quot; Frederiksen said. Denmark became the first country to offer to donate arms to Ukraine via direct purchases from the Ukrainian defense industry, as Kyiv&apos;s defense budget does not match the capacities of domestic weapons production. According to the president, the Ukrainian defense industry has already attracted over $1 billion in line with this financing model from partners, including Norway, which recently joined. Zelensky added that Ukraine should open the defense industry to full cooperation with partners. Denmark, one of Kyiv&apos;s key supporters throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, announced on Oct. 18 a new 2.4 billion kroner ($350 million) military aid package for Ukraine. This was Denmark&apos;s 21st military aid package since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Copenhagen previously provided Ukraine with a military aid package worth around $115 million in August.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-reportedly-uses-atacms-on-russian-territory-for-first-time-zelensky-presents-resilience-plan/	2024-11-19T12:31:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1430567940.jpg
Ukrainians optimistic about Trump feel a mix of Biden fatigue and hope for change	Despite warnings from some analysts ahead of the U.S. elections that a win by the Republican nominee Donald Trump could become a &#x201C;worst-case scenario&#x201D; for Ukraine, the mood in Kyiv after his victory was far more mixed. Some Ukrainians are optimistic that the president-elect could improve Kyiv&#x2019;s standing amid Russian ongoing onslaught. &#x201C;I am generally up for changes,&#x201D; said a Special Operations sniper with the callsign Bart, who is currently rehabilitating in Kyiv. &#x201C;I believe that (President Joe) Biden and his administration are impotent,&#x201D; he told the Kyiv Independent the day after the election, adding that a Trump victory could spell more decisive action. The recurring theme among Ukrainian residents hopeful that Trump will turn the tide of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion was an overarching sense of fatigue with the pace of Biden&#x2019;s support for Ukraine and a desire for quicker action. After Trump&#x2019;s victory in 2016, there was &#x201C;huge disappointment and frustration in the air,&#x201D; recalled Oleksiy Melnyk, the co-director of foreign policy and international security at the Kyiv-based think tank Razumkov Center. This year, however, he said he noticed &#x201C;no big expectations, so no big disappointment.&#x201D; &#x201C;Ukrainians are extremely grateful to the United States still, but at the same time, we do understand that part of our problems are because of the Biden administration&#x2019;s policy of escalation management and self-restrictions,&#x201D; Melnyk said. Many Ukrainians predicted that a Kamala Harris election would not have brought about any radical change, he said, while &#x201C;in the case of Trump, this unpredictability gives some people hope.&#x201D; Serhii Fursa, deputy managing director at Kyiv-based investment firm Dragon Capital, said, &#x201C;I feel bad. But markets feel okay, assuming he will end the war.&#x201D; Fursa described the market signal as &#x201C;total uncertainty.&#x201D; Trump has repeatedly said he would end the war within 24 hours, though has not provided details on how he plans to achieve such a result. Not all experts had predicted that a Trump win would be devastating for Ukraine, with some urging a &#x201C;wait-and-see&#x201D; attitude. &quot;We&#x2019;re going to work very hard on Russia and Ukraine. It&#x2019;s gotta stop. Russia and Ukraine&#x2019;s gotta stop,&quot; Trump said at an event in Florida on Nov. 14. Optimism in Ukraine following the election was nonetheless cautious and came from three main reasons, said Timothy Garton Ash, an Oxford professor of European Studies, historian, and commentator. &#x201C;First, they were so disappointed with the Biden administration&#x2019;s self-deterrence that they thought something else might be better,&#x201D; he said. Secondly, he added, U.S. politicians who genuinely supported Ukraine signaled that a Trump victory would work out all right. U.S. President Joe Biden meets with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S. on Nov. 13, 2024. (Saul Loeb / AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;And the third reason is probably the most important of all,&#x201D; noted Ash. &#x201C;If you&apos;re fighting a war for your survival, you&apos;ve got to believe that you can win. And if it looks as if your most important single ally is going to pull the rug on you, you know you&apos;re going to keep hoping and put a brave face on it that it&apos;s going to be okay.&#x201D; Still, Ash noted, he believes the optimism is &#x201C;misplaced.&#x201D; &#x201C;It&apos;s quite clear from the first conversations that Trump has had with people, he wants to get the issue off the table. He wants to go as fast as possible for that deal so he can get on to other things,&#x201D; said Ash. &#x201C;So now, optimism or pessimism focuses on the Europeans. Whether the Germans, the French, the British, the Poles and others can step into the breach.&#x201D; Oleksiy Haran, professor of comparative politics at Kyiv Mohyla Academy, however, noted that there was very little concrete data to show how widespread &#x2014; or limited &#x2014; support for Trump was among ordinary Ukrainians. Without polling data, he added, it was difficult to draw conclusions about Ukrainians&#x2019; attitudes. &#x201C;I wouldn&#x2019;t generalize any sentiments for Trump among ordinary Ukrainians,&#x201D; Haran noted. &#x201C;Clearly, there are some people who wanted Trump to win. But we cannot say that this is the majority, or even that this is a significant number of citizens of Ukraine.&#x201D; Even among Ukrainians who expressed positive sentiment about a Trump win, enthusiasm was tempered. &#x201C;The pace of decision-making (in the Biden administration), especially on critical military support, has sometimes been slower than the reality of the situation required,&#x201D; said Vitalii Ivanov, a communications and investment manager at Kyiv-based UFuture. &#x201C;The Trump presidency is likely to introduce a more practical and pragmatic approach to policy making, which could lead to faster decision-making by the administration,&#x201D; Ivanov said. &#x201C;Still, I would like to underline that we need to focus on solving our domestic problems and acting to make our country successful rather than worrying about who wins the U.S. election and what this or that president will do for us.&#x201D; Part of the response in Kyiv can be attributed to Ukraine&#x2019;s recent and historical experience dealing with radical changes, said Melnyk from Razumkov Center. &#x201C;In general, this is kind of the Ukrainian attitude: Ok, it happened. Life goes on.&#x201D; &#x201C;We can speculate about more general things like the peace formula through power or force,&#x201D; said Melnyk. &#x201C;But we have about two months before (Trump&#x2019;s) inauguration to get prepared for different scenarios. Hope is not a strategy.&#x201D; The Kyiv Independent business editor Liliane Bivings and business reporter Dominic Culverwell contributed to this report.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-fatigue-gives-some-ukrainians-optimism-for-trump-while-analysts-warn-hope-is-not-a-strategy/	2024-11-19T12:19:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184603537.jpg
South Korea has not participated in Czech shell initiative for Ukraine, official says	South Korea did not contribute to the Czech initiative to purchase artillery shells for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Tomas Kopecny, Czech government commissioner for the restoration of Ukraine, said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on Nov. 19. Czechia unveiled its initiative to jointly purchase artillery shells for Ukraine from undisclosed third countries earlier this year, amid shell shortages caused mainly by delays in U.S. assistance. In October, Ukraine received over one-third of the 500,000 155 mm shells expected to be delivered under the Czech initiative by the end of 2024. South Korea did not provide artillery shells of its own production, nor did it make financial contributions to the purchase of shells from other countries under the Czech initiative to purchase ammunition for Ukraine from third countries, according to Kopecny. &quot;So far, South Korea has not participated in the Czech initiative. From a financial point of view, they were not among the 16 countries that contributed, and they were not among the supplier countries from which we received the shells. This is the situation as of now,&quot; Kopecny said. Thus, the official denied the information previously published in the German media Bild that South Korea was probably one of the ammunition suppliers under the Czech initiative. Earlier, South Korea&apos;s Yonhap news agency reported that South Korea had no plans to supply 155 mm shells to Ukraine amid reports of North Korean soldiers participating in the war. Since the start of the full-scale war though, South Korean shells have reportedly been sent to Ukraine, but this was done so indirectly, through undisclosed U.S. purchases. On Oct. 22, Seoul announced a possible revision of its support for Kyiv, including the provision of lethal weapons and personnel, depending on the situation in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/south-korea-has-not-participated-in-czech-initiative-to-purchase-shells-for-ukraine-official-says/	2024-11-19T11:39:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1251756590.jpg
Deputy energy minister: How Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has endured over 1,000 attacks in 1,000 days of full-scale war	Over nearly 1,000 days of full-scale war, Russia has attacked Ukraine&#x2019;s energy system more than 1,000 times. Despite this relentless onslaught, Ukrainian power engineers have achieved a historic feat: maintaining energy supply stability by repeatedly repairing equipment, sometimes three or four times after consecutive strikes. This remarkable effort has not only ensured light and heat for Ukrainian homes but has also created a model of resilience and expertise that will be studied by future generations and international energy experts alike. The energy system is stable and prepared for the heating season under normal conditions. However, one constant risk looms: massive Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. The only effective defense remains bolstering Ukraine&#x2019;s air defenses. Russia&#x2019;s primary goal in targeting Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure is to create social unrest and destabilize the nation&#x2019;s rear by cutting off electricity and heating &#x2014; critical for household comfort and economic stability. Since 2022, the nature of these attacks has evolved. Early strikes reflected pre-war planning and Russia&#x2019;s initial military strategy. Over the course of 2023 and 2024, however, the attacks grew more widespread and destructive, with Russia employing more advanced weapons. This year alone, 9 GW of power generation capacity from thermal, combined heat and power, and hydro plants have been disabled. During the largest attack, on Aug. 26, 236 missiles and drones targeted Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure. Russia used its most expensive weaponry, including ballistic missiles and cluster munitions valued at over $1 billion, damaging substations critical to nuclear power plants. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has since expanded monitoring at these facilities. In 2023, after extensive destruction, Ukraine began a robust repair campaign and received critical support from international partners. Spare parts from decommissioned European power plants, notably those supplied by Baltic nations, played a vital role in restoring operations quickly, as the production time for new equipment is lengthy. The European Union Delegation to Ukraine launched a platform to provide surplus energy equipment from EU warehouses, offering essential short-term solutions. Additionally, electricity import capacity has increased from 200 MW to 1.7 GW, thanks to prolonged negotiations with EU governments and the G7. This milestone was reached just before the heating season commenced. The foundation of Ukraine&#x2019;s preparedness lies in the restoration of power generation and transmission equipment that could be brought back online before the heating season. This effort included the largest repair campaign in the history of independent Ukraine. Notably, our nuclear power plants (NPPs), which supply around 60% of the country&#x2019;s electricity, are set to operate at full capacity this winter, with nine power units in operation in Ukraine-controlled areas &#x2014; despite the Russian occupation of the Zaporizhzhia NPP, Europe&#x2019;s largest nuclear plant.

(Andrew Kravchenko/Bloomberg via Getty Images)A critical factor in meeting demand during the 2024/2025 heating season was the increase in electricity imports. Following assessments of the decisions made in 2023 and their effectiveness, as well as high-level negotiations with EU partners and the European Commission, we successfully raised our import capacity to 2.1 GW on a commercial basis, with an additional 250 MW available for emergency assistance. While the Power System Integration Action Plan, adopted in 2019, outlined a five-year timeline for technical and legal measures to integrate Ukraine into the EU&#x2019;s energy system, Ukraine has accelerated this process and is now de facto integrated, becoming a full member of the EU energy network. Another vital component of our energy strategy is the expansion of distributed generation across the country. The government has created favorable conditions for this development, implementing key decisions to simplify construction and environmental regulations and streamline the process for connecting to electricity and gas networks. Moreover, a series of financial measures have been introduced to support households, condominium associations (COAs), and public utilities in building their own generation facilities. These include interest-free loans for households and low-interest loans for utilities, as well as a zero-rate import duty and VAT on energy goods used for electricity generation. These measures have made it more affordable and efficient to purchase and install the necessary equipment without excessive bureaucracy. In parallel, a collaborative initiative led by the Office of the President, Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Regional Development, and regional authorities is underway to develop &#x201C;regional energy independence passports.&#x201D; This effort will assess local energy consumption and identify the needs for backup power, particularly for critical infrastructure. It also takes into account changes in consumption patterns due to internal displacement, population migration, and damage caused by the war. These passports will focus on the development of local gas and electricity networks, ensuring that solutions like solar panels, geothermal energy, wind power, and gas generation are tailored to the region&apos;s specific needs and climate conditions. As a result of these efforts, nearly 2 GW of new generation capacity is already being commissioned, largely driven by commercial and business interests. Simultaneously, international donors have provided local governments and utilities with a significant number of gas generators, cogeneration units, and mobile boiler houses to ensure backup power for critical infrastructure. The success of distributed generation depends on a coordinated effort among local communities, regional administrations, national authorities, and energy companies. This integrated approach is key to ensuring economic independence for communities and fostering energy resilience. Despite the challenges ahead, we have prepared for the 2024/25 heating season. Russia will &#xA0;persist in its efforts to plunge Ukraine into darkness and cold &#x2014; as it did in its 10th mass attack on Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure on Nov. 17 &#x2014; but thanks to the tireless work of power engineers, the collaboration of central and local authorities, and unwavering international support, we are prepared to keep Ukrainian homes warm and well-lit throughout the winter. Trust in the power engineers &#x2014; they have done more than could have been imagined.

Ukraine deserves to make next year a year of peace' — Zelensky addresses European Parliament	Ukraine deserves to make next year a year of peace, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 19 during the European Parliament&apos;s extraordinary session dedicated to the 1,000th day of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. &quot;A thousand days of war is a tremendous challenge. Ukraine deserves to make next year a year of peace,&quot; Zelensky said. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, extending their aggression beyond the occupied Donbas region in attempt to effectively end the statehood of independent Ukraine. In his online address, Zelensky thanked the partners for their support and urged them not to forget that &quot;the united strength of Europe&quot; is greater than Russian President Vladimir Putin. &quot;If we could stop Europe&apos;s way of life from falling, then we can surely push Russia towards a just peace,&quot; Zelensky added. The president also stressed the need for tougher sanctions, especially against Russia&apos;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet&quot; that transports crude oil and oil products in circumvention of existing restrictions. &quot;If anyone in Europe thinks they can sell Ukraine &#x2014; or any other country, like the Baltic states, the Balkans, Georgia, or Moldova &#x2014; to Moscow and gain something in return, let them remember this simple truth &#x2014; no one can enjoy calm waters amid a storm.&quot; The milestone comes as Ukraine braces for a difficult and uncertain winter. Russia, on Nov. 17, launched one of its largest aerial attacks yet against Ukraine&apos;s energy grid, leaving civilians dead and injured across multiple regions. The future of U.S. military aid to Ukraine is also in question as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office in January. Meanwhile, thousands of Russian and North Korean forces have amassed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, preparing to launch a counteroffensive against Ukrainian troops. The escalating situation in Kursk reportedly prompted U.S. President Joe Biden to grant Ukraine permission to use American long-range weapons on Russian territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-deserves-to-make-next-year-a-year-of-peace-zelensky-addresses-european-parliament/	2024-11-19T10:49:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1850792057.jpg
1,000 days of full-scale war: Reflections from the Kyiv Independent team	As we mark 1,000 days since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, members of the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s staff have paused to reflect. These reflections offer a glimpse into the profound impact of war &#x2014; not only on a nation&#x2019;s struggle for survival but on those who bear witness to its unfolding. War reporter Although I was in Lviv when the full-scale war started, the first months of the war were something I experienced mostly from the outside &#x2014; through news, at a safe distance from the front line. Those first months had a frantic, superlative energy to them: a time of heroes and legends, but also of horrors and depravity we thought impossible in the 21st century. I joined the Kyiv Independent during the season of liberations &#x2014; a time that remains the most powerful experience of my life. Light and dark existed together: the unbridled jubilation of Kherson&#x2019;s liberation made possible by what Russia had put the city through &#x2014; the tortured, the deported, the stolen, the murdered. Even now, my iPhone suggests musical slideshows of &#x201C;The Great Outdoors: Autumn 2022,&#x201D; filled with pictures of the mass graves in Izium. Back then, we all thought that the next big counteroffensive was just around the corner, and we screamed at the West to act with greater courage and urgency. We knew the road ahead wouldn&#x2019;t be easy, but we didn&#x2019;t anticipate what came next. First, Bakhmut: Russia&#x2019;s dress rehearsal for wave attacks paired with the complete annihilation of cities. Then, the summer counteroffensive, which had taken on such a biblical weight in the lead-up that it left me with a pit in my stomach before it even started. The counteroffensive taught me some important lessons &#x2014; the greatest being the danger of wishful thinking and the necessity of clinging tightly to reality while navigating the darkness of war. Since then, the darkness has only deepened: realizing the West&#x2019;s fear of Ukrainian victory, reckoning with Kyiv&#x2019;s failure to fix internal issues in the military that could turn a stable defense into collapse, and understanding that no amount of individual heroism can stop a glide bomb. Now, winter is coming, bringing with it what feels like a reckoning for Ukraine and the free world. It&#x2019;s a bit hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel at the moment. But, in the meantime, there&#x2019;s no shortage of light to be found around the place &#x2014; in Ukrainians, and especially in Ukrainian soldiers, thanks to whom I can still type this out in free Kyiv.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)Anna BelokurSocial media managerOne thousand days ago, I woke up in Helsinki, Finland, to a phone full of messages. The top one just said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m so sorry.&#x201D; My friends and I joined hundreds of others holding signs outside the Russian embassy, standing in the snow and dark after the sun set in the early afternoon. Every time someone peeked through the embassy&#x2019;s blinds, the crowd would scream angrily. Finns are deeply reserved people who rarely make eye contact with strangers, but in the days that followed, other dog walkers began nodding at me and exchanging startled looks when cars backfired. There was a heightened awareness that Finland&#x2019;s trademark peacefulness is a gift, not a guarantee. Finns &#x2014; like Ukrainians, Latvians, and a handful of others &#x2014; have a joke: they don&#x2019;t have to deal with deadly insects or hurricanes, but they suffer from the greatest natural disaster of all &#x2014; sharing a border with Russia. Finland has defenses woven into every part of society, from the spots under ordinary bridges designed for detonating explosives to the mandatory year of military service required of every Finnish man. One man told me that training exercises are always based on the assumption of an attack from the east. I don&#x2019;t know a single Finn who wants to fight, but I also don&#x2019;t know a single one who isn&#x2019;t prepared to. Feb. 24, 2022, is the only time I ever heard Finns scream in anger. Writing this from Kyiv 1,000 days later, I draw strength from the fact that Ukraine still has allies who understand what&#x2019;s at stake. These are nations that have closed their borders with Russia, advocated against any form of appeasement, and trained to defend against attacks from the east. Just as I wasn&#x2019;t alone that day, we aren&#x2019;t alone now.

When the war began in 2014, I was in middle school. Growing up in Donetsk Oblast, I remember those early days vividly &#x2014; a child surrounded by adults grappling with the reality of Russian terror. The news of the full-scale invasion came while I was in university in Bulgaria. By then, the decision to return to Ukraine after graduation felt natural. Now an adult, it&apos;s my turn to confront the terror. I do so as part of the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s War Crimes Investigations Unit. In these 1,000 days, the Russian army has committed thousands of war crimes. My team works tirelessly on cases of sexual violence, torture of prisoners of war, civilian murders, and child deportation. People often ask if I&#x2019;m exhausted by the constant exposure to such horror. My answer: my motivation outweighs the exhaustion. Justice is an essential part of Ukraine&#x2019;s victory. It will come when the voices of war crimes victims are heard, and the names of perpetrators are spoken clearly and without fear. Ultimately, our unity and determination will decide whether my children&#x2019;s generation will have to face Russian terror. My hope is that they never will.

(Roman Pilipey / AFP via Getty Images)4o miniAsami TerajimaWar reporter A year ago today, I received a Facebook message from a friend serving in the mortar unit of the Ukrainian military&#x2019;s 93rd Separate Mechanized Brigade near embattled Chasiv Yar. &#x201C;We have suffered a great tragedy today,&#x201D; he said. I felt a chill, already dreading what he might say. I immediately asked what had happened. I was scrambling to finish packing for a work trip to Kherson, but my mind spiraled toward worst-case scenarios. After a pause, he replied: &#x201C;Three 200s.&#x201D; The military code for killed in action in Ukraine. Any loss is devastating, but you always hope it&#x2019;s not someone close. I opened WhatsApp to check who had been online last and realized my dear friend Vladyslav hadn&#x2019;t logged on since early morning. I soon discovered that three men, including the unit commander and 28-year-old Vladyslav, had been killed by a Russian anti-tank missile. Another friend, who miraculously survived, had to pull out the charred remains of Vladyslav&#x2019;s body from their position. The shock was unbearable. My mind replayed bittersweet summer memories: fishing in the dark before dawn, celebrating birthdays with late-night barbecues. Those golden days &#x2014; despite their nearness to the front line &#x2014; are now irretrievably gone. It&#x2019;s strange how the warm smiles you once took for granted fade into distant memories. Even now, it doesn&#x2019;t feel real that they&#x2019;re gone forever. The cottage-turned-military base where we spent those summers was damaged by Russian shelling this year. What remains are fleeting memories and low-quality iPhone photos. A thousand days into Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war, you develop a numbness to pain &#x2014; a survival mechanism that feels both unsettling and inevitable. It&#x2019;s hard to believe it&#x2019;s been less than three years since I was a 21-year-old university student-turned-journalist on Feb. 24, 2022, questioning whether I had what it took to cover the war. Long gone are the days when World War I-style trench warfare and cluster munitions were only scenes from films. Now, death feels ever-present, a constant reminder of how fragile and fleeting life is.

(Roman Pilipey / AFP via Getty Images)Daryna ShevchenkoCEO It&#x2019;s been exactly 1,000 days since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began, and I&#x2019;ve been sleeping like a baby the entire time. I know that&#x2019;s not what you expect to hear from a Ukrainian living in Kyiv, especially when most news reports focus on how Russian attacks deprive the nation of sleep and rest. On Feb. 24, 2022, I woke up to my alarm clock, ready for a normal workday. My phone was buzzing with hundreds of missed calls and messages from colleagues and family. I slept through the explosions, air raid sirens, the noise in my building, kids crying, and dogs barking. It was the last morning in the next 999 days that I woke up feeling rested. Since then, I&#x2019;ve slept through hundreds of overnight attacks, drones flying by my window, and air defense missiles nearby. I thought I was lucky &#x2014; or perhaps more resilient than others &#x2014; until I realized that I had also lost my mornings. Returning to reality became a real challenge over the past three years. I drink coffee, work out, and take walks in fresh air, but nothing helps. I still spend most of my energy fighting for moments of concentration and trying to live life to the fullest. My psychiatrist says excessive sleep under stress isn&#x2019;t normal, just as insomnia isn&#x2019;t. My attempts to convince myself that this is a &#x201C;good sign&#x201D; are a futile search for normalcy. And guess what? Normalcy has nothing to do with war. I&#x2019;ve been lucky not to lose anyone close to me in this war &#x2014; yet. But none of us, here in Ukraine, are emerging unscarred. Lately, I&#x2019;ve seen more comments on social media from foreigners doubting the horrors of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, looking at photos and videos from Kyiv, Lviv, or Odesa, where dressed-up crowds attend concerts or sit at cafe terraces, appearing so normal. Sleep or no sleep, makeup or blood and bruises, our reality is never normal. Not in the last 1,000 days. The truth is, the only way for the world to preserve its normalcy is to help us recover ours.

(Maxym Marusenko/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Teah PelechatyOpinion editor I wrote this poem in the early months of the full-scale war, before moving to Kyiv in August 2023. At the time, I worked on the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s news desk from Toronto, bearing witness to the war through a relentless stream of images and reports. A war fought in real time on my screen while the world outside my window remained indifferent, untouched. Rereading this poem now, I realize how the exhaustion of carrying this grief for 1,000 days remains just as heavy as the day I wrote it &#x2014; grief not only for what has been lost but for the unbearable contrast of living in between. Even as I sit here writing, I&apos;ve forgotten.I tend to forget these days. The city I care not to see assaults my eyes,my ears,my nose,with its relentless permanence. The billboard at the corner thrashes red,abrasive and blinking,and in its glare, I see her fingernails &#x2014;also red, but still now, lifeless. At the club,dim lights scatter across the throng,fracturing faces, bodies, limbs &#x2014;suffocating. As bodies crush and contort around me,swaying to a cacophony of Canada&#x2019;s Top Hits,each appendage belongs at once to everyone,to no one. In a mass grave,each appendage belongs at once to everyone,to no one. They are perfect, her fingernails.So meticulously crafted and polished,amaranth red and adhered to a hand that has long gone limp.I wonder if they will remain as her body withers. I forget her face.I tend to forget these days.I forget her face &#x2014;the woman with the red fingernails &#x2014;and yet, I do not search for it. With each subsequent grave &#x2014;Bucha, Mariupol, Izium &#x2014;and with each subsequent face,in my mind&#x2019;s eye,there remain only red fingernails.

(Roman Pilipey /AFP via Getty Images)Kate TsurkanCulture reporter Focusing too much on how many days have passed since the start of the full-scale war only deepens the sorrow I feel when confronted with news of more innocent people who were killed by Russia. In such moments, the future seems distant, fragile &#x2013; a thread barely visible. Counting days can seem meaningless when time itself feels distorted. Plus, this war stretches back over a decade for some Ukrainians, and we can&#x2019;t forget that. What keeps me awake at night is thinking about how this war will shape my daughter and every Ukrainian child, leaving its shadow on their lives long after it ends. (Will it ever truly end?) The only thing I can count on is how I will try to bring kindness and goodness into the world.	https://kyivindependent.com/1-000-days-of-full-scale-war-reflections-from-the-kyiv-independent-team/	2024-11-19T09:13:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1620281416.jpg

German opposition criticizes Scholz for refusing to transfer Taurus missiles to Ukraine	Florian Hahn, a member of the German opposition CDU/CSU bloc, criticized Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos;s decision not to transfer long-range Taurus missiles to Ukraine, German media outlet Tagesschau reported on Nov. 19. Berlin is Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor under Scholz, but the chancellor has been adamant about not providing Taurus missiles, fearing it could draw his country into the war. &quot;The chancellor is once again putting party interests above the interests of Germany&apos;s foreign and security policy,&quot; Hahn said. Scholz wants to enlist the support of the left wing of his Social Democratic Party in the upcoming election campaign, Hahn claimed. Because of his stubborn resistance to providing the missiles, the chancellor was once again perceived as an &quot;indecisive and unreliable&quot; partner on the international level, the politician added. Friedrich Merz, leader of the opposition center-right CDU/CSU alliance and potential future Chancellor, said he would allow the delivery of Taurus missiles but only after issuing an ultimatum to Russian President Vladimir Putin and lifting restrictions on already provided arms. Current Vice Chancellor and former Green party leader Robert Habeck, also said that if elected, he would also greenlight the delivery of Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine. The German-Swedish-built, air-launched Taurus missiles have a range of up to 500 kilometers (310 miles), which is more than the U.S.-built ATACMS or the Storm Shadow/SCALP missiles provided to Ukraine by the U.K. and France.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-opposition-cdu-csu-bloc-criticizes-scholz-for-refusing-to-transfer-taurus-missiles-to-ukraine/	2024-11-19T08:24:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2076693556.jpg
Denmark to provide over $137 million for Ukrainian defense industry	Denmark will allocate 130 million euros ($137.5 million) for the development of the Ukrainian defense industry, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announced on Nov. 19 during a joint press briefing with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Frederiksen came to Kyiv on Nov. 19 in a surprise visit and met Zelensky on the 1,000th day of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;It is important to me that our own industry, not only in Denmark but in all neighboring countries, can visit Ukraine and learn from your experience and your ability to expand and develop your production lines,&quot; Frederiksen said. Denmark became the first country to offer to donate arms to Ukraine via direct purchases from the Ukrainian defense industry, as Kyiv&#x2019;s defense budget does not match the capacities of domestic weapons production. According to the president, the Ukrainian defense industry has already attracted over $1 billion in line with this financing model from partners, including Norway, which recently joined. Zelensky added that Ukraine should open the defense industry to full cooperation with partners. Denmark, one of Kyiv&apos;s key supporters throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, announced on Oct. 18 a new 2.4 billion kroner ($350 million) military aid package for Ukraine. This was Denmark&apos;s 21st military aid package since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Copenhagen previously provided Ukraine with a military aid package worth around $115 million in August.	https://kyivindependent.com/denmark-to-provide-over-137-million-for-ukrainian-defense-industry/	2024-11-19T07:55:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161108238.jpg
Putin is playing with our fears' — German FM on Russia's updated nuclear doctrine	Russian President Vladimir Putin seeks to intimidate the West by expanding the conditions for using nuclear weapons in Russia&#x2019;s updated nuclear doctrine, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Nov. 19. Speaking at a news conference in Poland during a meeting of foreign ministers from Germany, Poland, France, and Italy, Baerbock emphasized that Berlin would heed warnings from Ukraine&apos;s neighboring countries.&quot;We will not let ourselves be intimidated,&quot; she said, adding that this is not the first time the Kremlin has resorted to nuclear threats. Putin&#x2019;s approval of the updated nuclear deterrence policy was confirmed through a presidential decree published on Nov. 19. The revised doctrine expands scenarios that could justify a nuclear strike, including &quot;aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies by a non-nuclear state with the support of a nuclear state&quot; and large-scale non-nuclear attacks, such as drone strikes. Baerbock accused Russia of exploiting the West&#x2019;s fears but highlighted Europe&#x2019;s unprecedented unity.&quot;After February 2022, the federal government said it would not repeat this mistake a second time. That&apos;s why we are here together, cooperating as Europeans and representing the strongest European countries,&quot; she said.	https://kyivindependent.com/baerbock-putin-nuclear-doctrine/	2024-11-19T05:59:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/baerbock.jpeg
Ukraine state-owned enterprises weekly — Issue 154	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This is issue 154 of Ukrainian State-Owned Enterprises Weekly, covering events from Oct. 24-Nov. 17, 2024. The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission. Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure under attack, first in almost three months; power outage schedules are back. On Nov. 17, Ukraine&#x2019;s energy minister Herman Galushchenko reported that Russia launched another massive missile and drone attack on Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure. According to the minister, Russian troops attacked electricity generation and transmission facilities all over Ukraine. Russia&#x2019;s attack came on the night and morning of Nov. 17, characterized by the use of combined weapons, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force said. Russia launched 210 aerial weapons, with Ukraine&#x2019;s air defence downing 102 missiles and 42 drones. Air defense units were responding to Russian aerial targets in almost every Ukrainian region. Ukrenergo reported damaged power facilities and later said that two of its employees were killed in an attack on a substation in Odesa Oblast. Due to the attacks, the company was forced to introduce emergency power outages in several regions. The outages were cancelled later that day, but Ukrenergo announced power outage schedules for Nov. 18 in all Ukrainian oblasts from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. local time. Rinat Akhmetov&#x2019;s DTEK, Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy holding, reported that Russia attacked its thermal power plants (TPPs) again, severely damaging equipment. This is the eighth massive attack on its TPPs in 2024, DTEK added. From March 22 to Aug. 26 Ukraine had faced seven massive missile and drone strikes on electricity facilities. See our Issues 124, 125, 127, 129, 131, 134, and 145 for more detail. The Nov. 17 attack was the first massive one since then. After every Russian mass missile attack on Ukraine&#x2019;s vital infrastructure, emergency outages take place, lasting for days due to the ongoing repair works. During such outages, people in Ukraine are often left without electricity, heating, water supply, or access to mobile phone networks. Ukrenergo in technical default on &#x201C;green&#x201D; bonds. On Nov. 6, Ukrenergo reported that, starting from Nov. 9, it will temporarily suspend payments on debt obligations for green sustainable development bonds ($825 million) issued in 2021 under a state guarantee. Ukrenergo emphasized that this technical measure will remain in effect until the debt restructuring is completed, which is planned in the coming months. &#x201C;The bondholders of the company have been and will continue to be important partners of Ukrenergo. In 2022, the parties agreed to defer bond repayments, which helped to support the company during wartime and significantly contributed to its financial resilience over the past two years. In the near future, the company intends to engage with the group of bondholders to agree on fair and mutually acceptable amendments to the terms of the bonds to ensure long-term financial stability,&#x201D; the company said. The Helsinki District Court freezes Russian assets in Finland at Naftogaz&#x2019;s request. On Oct. 28, Naftogaz announced that the Helsinki District Court had granted its motion, ordering the freezing of certain assets owned by Russia in Finland. These include real estate and other assets valued in the tens of millions of dollars. This decision is part of Naftogaz&#x2019;s global strategy to recover compensation for losses resulting from the seizure of its assets in Crimea, as ordered by the Hague Arbitration Tribunal, the company explained. It is also the first publicly known successful asset freeze outside Ukraine in the enforcement of arbitration awards filed by Ukrainian companies against Russia for the expropriation of property in Crimea in 2014. This is an interim step toward the actual recovery of assets in favour of Naftogaz, the press release reads. &#x201C;Since Russia refuses to voluntarily pay Naftogaz the compensation stipulated by the Hague ruling, we continue to leverage all available mechanisms to recover these funds. Today, we are one step closer to restoring justice. Simultaneously, we are actively pursuing enforcement of the arbitration award in other target jurisdictions where Russian assets are located,&#x201D; Naftogaz&#x2019;s CEO Oleksiy Chernyshov said. As we wrote in April 2023, the Hague&#x2019;s Arbitration Tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration ordered Russia to pay $5 billion to cover Naftogaz&#x2019;s losses in Crimea when Russia seized them in 2014. See our Issue 83 for more detail. Ukraine increases gas production to its highest level since the start of the full-scale war, Ukrgasvydobuvannya and Ukrnafta top the list. According to ExPro&#x2019;s calculations, in October 2024, Ukraine&#x2019;s gas production increased by 2.3% year-on-year to 1.6 billion cubic meters (bcm). This is the highest monthly production since January 2022, prior to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, the media oulet added. According to ExPro, Ukrgasvydobuvannya, a Naftogaz subsidiary, increased gas production by 1.6% to 1.24 bcm in October 2024. Ukrgasvydobuvannya produced 12.1 bcm in 10 months of 2024, 5.4% more than in 2023. Ukrnafta, another Naftogaz company, increased its gas production by 4.6% to 96.4 million cubic meters in October 2024. The company produced 967 million cubic meters in 10 months of 2024, up 7% year-on-year. At the same time, private companies increased gas production by 4.4% year-on-year to 324 million cubic meters. In total, private companies produced 2.75 bcm in 10 months of 2024, 12% less than in 2023. According to ExPro&#x2019;s forecasts, total gas production in Ukraine may increase by 2.2% to 19.1 bcm in 2024. Chornomornaftogaz receives new contract terms for managing Firtash&#x2019;s gas distribution companies. On Nov. 13, the Asset Recovery and Management Agency (ARMA) announced that it had signed a modification agreement with Chornomornaftogaz as the manager of Firtash&#x2019;s seized regional gas distribution companies. According to ARMA, Chornomornaftogaz paid Hr 172 million to the state budget from managing Firtash&#x2019;s companies in 2022 [5.01 million euros at the average exchange rate over that period). At the same time, the manager guaranteed to pay more than Hr 500 million from managing these assets in 2023 [12.6 million euros at the average exchange rate over that period, ARMA added. In our earlier issues, we reported on the wave of taking over fugitive tycoon Dmytro Firtash&#x2019;s gas distribution companies by Naftogaz: As a result, Naftogaz Group now operates 27 gas distribution companies, which were planned to be transferred to state control by the end of 2023, Naftogaz explained. As we wrote in Issue 113, the integration of regional gas companies positioned Naftogaz as a monopoly in gas distribution, but it is a wartime measure, and they should be privatized via public auctions when &#x201C;the situation allows this,&quot; Naftogaz&#x2019;s CEO Oleksii Chernyshov said one year ago. As we wrote in Issue 126, Chornomornaftogaz, as the manager of Firtash&#x2019;s seized regional gas distribution companies, paid Hr 63.6 million, or 1.5 million euros at the going exchange rate, in 2022 dividends. As we wrote in Issue 138, on June 25, the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) revoked the seizure of shares in gas distribution companies held by Firtash&#x2019;s Regional Gas Company (RGC). On the same day, ARMA reported that it had already appealed to the Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office to re-arrest the companies. Later that day, ARMA said that Kyiv&#x2019;s Pechersk District Court returned them to state ownership. The winning bidder pays $60.5 million for Ukraine Hotel in Kyiv. On Oct. 30, the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) announced that Ola Fine LLC, the winner of the privatization auction, had fully paid Hr 2.5 billion ($60.5 million) for the hotel itself and Hr 502 million ($12 million) in VAT. These funds will be used, in particular, to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the SPFU added. According to the Economy Ministry, as of the end-March 2024, the hotel&#x2019;s wage arrears amounted to Hr 3.9 million ($94,000), budget arrears stood at Hr 10.8 million ($261,000), and overdue accounts payable totaled Hr 21 million ($508,000). In addition, the buyer must provide social guarantees in accordance with the law and may not lay off employees for six months. As we wrote in Issue 148, on Sept. 18, the SPFU sold Kyiv&#x2019;s four-star Ukraine Hotel for Hr 2.5 billion ($60.5 million). According to the SPFU, Ukraine Hotel has 363 rooms, six conference halls, meeting rooms, a shelter with a separate auditorium for events for 50 people, and a parking lot for 80 cars. Ola Fine LLC is owned by businessman Maksym Krippa. The auction winner had 30 working days to pay the lot price. As we reported in Issue 148, Maksym Krippa, a businessman that avoids publicity, became famous in 2022 when Forbes Ukraine wrote that he had acquired a major Ukrainian e-sports brand, the NAVI team. Later, the businessman&#x2019;s representatives confirmed that the deal was concluded back in 2018. Krippa also owns Maincast e-sports broadcasting studio. In 2023, he acquired GSC Game World, a company that developed the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. cyber game. Krippa, who acquired the Brovary Wholesale Market back in 2009, has recently started buying up significant real estate objects in Kyiv. In 2020, he purchased the Dnipro Hotel in Kyiv, which is located near Ukraine Hotel; and at the end of 2023, the Parus Business Center, previously owned by businessman and former MP Vadym Stolar. See more on Krippa in Issue 148. The sale of Ukraine Hotel increased privatization proceeds to Hr 5.7 billion ($138 million), the Economy Ministry reported on Oct. 31. This is already Hr 1.7 billion more than the revenue planned for 2024, the Ministry added. As we wrote in Issue 114, the 2024 state budget projected the privatization revenue at Hr 4 billion (around &#x20AC;95 million). According to a recent SPFU report, privatization generated UAH 2 billion (&#x20AC;46.7 million) in January-August 2024. All these proceeds were from small-scale privatisation. In other words, as we wrote, the privatization of Ukraine Hotel alone has generated more revenue than all small-scale privatisations since the beginning of this year. After Ola Fine paid up as required by the regulations, the SPFU&#x2019;s privatization revenue plan for 2024, however modest, was achieved for the first time in many years. Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi port finally sold. According to Prozorro.Sale, the twelfth attempt to sell the port was held on Oct. 31, and it failed again due to the absence of bidders. The starting price was Hr 178 million ($4.3 million). As we explained earlier in October, it was doubtful that the asset would attract bidders this time. See Issue 152 for detail. However, the thirteenth attempt, on Nov. 8, was successful. The starting price was halved to Hr 89 million ($2.1 million), and only one bidder, Top Offer LLC, took part in the auction. The company offered Hr 90 million ($2.2 million) for the asset. To complete the privatization, the bidder must pay that price and the VAT, a total of Hr 108 million ($2.6 million). Despite abundant releases on privatization on the SPFU&#x2019;s website, including news on minor events, there is no dedicated release on the successful sale of Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, in which the SPFU would provide more detail. According to YouControl, Top Offer LLC was registered in late 2023 in Kyiv. Its primary registered line of business is the lease and operation of owned or leased real estate. The company is owned by Yevhen Boguslavskyi, who also owns the financial company Inkam. At the beginning of 2023, commissioned by an unnamed investor, Inkam acquired MR Bank&#x2019;s lot which included the rights to a loan secured by the Tsarsky fitness club in Kyiv. Later, Top Offer LLC participated in the privatization auction for the Kyiv Prosthetic Plant but lost to another bidder. Boguslavskyi said he could not disclose the details of the privatization due to his NDA with the investor. According to him, the name of the seaport&#x2019;s new owner may become known within a month. Boguslavsky also refused to discuss the origin of the money for the purchase. &#x201C;In this project, I am acting in the investor&#x2019;s interest. He did not share all his plans with me. But I can say that he would restore the bridge across the Dniester estuary in Zatoka (which was destroyed by Russian missile attacks. It would not be this year, though, because not everything would happen at once,&#x201D; Boguslavsky explained. The first privatization auction for Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi in March 2023 failed as no one registered. At the second auction, the seaport was sold for Hr 220 million (around 5.6 million euros at the time) to Ukrdoninvest LLC, a company owned by Ukrainian businessman Vitaliy Kropachov. However, Ukrdoninvest decided not to pay up. As we reported in April 2023 (Issue 85), the company said that it backed out while hashing out the terms of the purchase agreement with SPFU&#x2019;s regional office in Odesa and Mykolaiv oblasts. In June 2023, SPFU announced that it would put Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi up for privatization for a third time, another attempt that failed (see Issue 93).&#x202F;In Issues 99 and 100, we reported about the following failed attempts to sell the port. As we wrote in August 2024 (Issue 144), former deputy infrastructure minister Viktor Dovhan posted on Facebook suggesting that Polish investors were considering participating in the privatization of the port. However, the ninth attempt to sell Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi also failed (see Issue 147), as did the tenth and eleventh (see Issue 148). As we also wrote in Issue 147, according to CASE Ukraine, despite the attractiveness of the asset, there were no bidders because the port had debts of Hr 151.3 million ($3.6 million as of today), which the winner would normally also have to settle, in addition to paying the purchase price and VAT (20%). If that information is (still) correct, the winning bidder would have to spend a total of Hr 259 million ($6.2 million) on the asset, including the seaport&#x2019;s purchase price, VAT, and outstanding debts. However, we are not aware of any information from the SPFU on this matter. For more on the history of Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi&#x2019;s privatization, see SOE Weekly&#x2019;s Issues 74, 78, 79, 84, 85, 87, 93, 99, 100, 144, 147, 148, and 152. SPFU officially takes over 49% of Shell petrol station chain in Ukraine, previously owned by sanctioned Khudainatov. On Nov. 5, the SPFU reported that it had become the owner of 49% of the share capital of Alliance Holding LLC, which operates Shell petrol station chain in Ukraine. Eduard Khudainatov, a former top manager of the Russian state-owned company Rosneft, owns Independent Oil and Gas Company. In June 2022, he was sanctioned by the European Union, and in October 2022, by Ukraine. Following a ruling by the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC), Khudainatov&#x2019;s Ukrainian assets, including his share in Alliance Holding LLC, were seized by the state. Pursuant to this ruling, the previous owners of Alliance Holding LLC, Cicerone Holding B.V., and Bogstone Holding B.V. were removed from the company&#x2019;s list of founders, liga.net added. The new ownership structure was approved: Shell Overseas Investments B.V., 51%; and the SPFU, 49%. The SPFU also noted that it was preparing to privatize its 49% stake in the Shell petrol station chain. As we wrote in Issue 130, the SPFU reported that it obtained control over 49% over Shell chain in April 2024. According to Forbes Ukraine, before Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Shell had 131 petrol stations in Ukraine, 118 of which still operated in April 2024. See Issue 130 for more detail.

Ukraine readies to start 1st cluster of EU accession talks in early 2025, Zelensky says	Ukraine is preparing to begin the first cluster of accession talks with the EU in early 2025, President Volodymyr Zelensky told Ukrainian lawmakers on Nov. 19. &quot;Ukraine should have the fastest accession process in the EU,&quot; Zelensky said while unveiling the country&apos;s internal resilience plan. According to the president, the EU will soon complete the screening of Ukraine&apos;s legislation, which is the first step on the integration path. Ukraine applied for EU membership days after Russia launched its full-scale war in February 2022 and received candidate status in June of that year. In December 2023, EU leaders agreed to open accession negotiations with Ukraine, marking a pivotal step in its integration efforts. The accession process formally began in June with opening talks in Luxembourg. According to Commissioner for Enlargement Oliver Varhelyi, Ukraine could join the European Union by 2029 if it completes the necessary reforms. To advance this goal, the EU has introduced specific initiatives, such as the &quot;Growth Plan&quot; and the &quot;Ukraine Plan,&quot; aimed at accelerating reform processes in Ukraine, Moldova, and the Western Balkans. Ukraine submitted its plan on March 20, detailing its vision for reconstruction, modernization, and reforms essential to its EU accession journey. The European Commission has recently praised Ukraine&#x2019;s progress on critical reforms, including those related to the rule of law, judicial system, and anti-corruption measures, though it emphasizes that further reforms are still required.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-readies-to-start-1st-cluster-of-eu-accession-talks-in-early-2025-zelensky-says/	2024-11-19T05:35:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177959215-1.jpg
EU ready to step up support for Ukraine if US reduces aid, Polish FM says	Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski announced on Nov. 19 that major EU countries are prepared to step up military and financial assistance to Ukraine if the U.S. reduces its support under President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s administration. Sikorski, speaking after a meeting of European foreign ministers in Poland, stressed the importance of Europe taking greater responsibility for its security. &quot;Strengthening Europe&#x2019;s defense capabilities must go hand in hand with maintaining the United States&#x2019; commitment to enhancing our security,&quot; noted Sikorski, as quoted by the Polish magazine Wprost. The statement comes amid growing uncertainties about Western support for Ukraine as Trump has previously criticized military aid for Kyiv and voiced intention to push toward a quick peace deal. Sikorski said that he and Kaja Kallas, the incoming EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, discussed strategies to bolster support for Ukraine. &quot;I gratefully acknowledge the readiness of the largest EU countries to take on the burden of military and financial support for Ukraine in the event of a potential reduction in U.S. involvement,&quot; he added. Trump said at a Mar-a-Lago event in Florida on Nov. 14 that his administration will focus on the Russia-Ukraine war. He hinted on Nov. 13 at appointing a peace envoy to lead negotiations aimed at ending the war, according to Fox News.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-ready-to-step-up-sikorski-says/	2024-11-19T05:21:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158687722.jpg

Over 50,000 Ukrainian recruits have received training in UK	More than 50,000 Ukrainian recruits have undergone training in the U.K. as part of the British-led Operation Interflex since June 2022, the U.K. Defense Ministry announced on Nov. 19. &quot;Kosovo, Romania, and Estonia are the latest nations to join this global effort, standing united for freedom and resilience,&quot; the Defense Ministry said on X. The project, also supported by 10 other partner countries, including Canada, New Zealand, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Lithuania, the Netherlands, and Australia, provides essential military training to Ukrainian recruits at various facilities. Operation Interflex, led by the U.K., is one of the key programs aimed at preparing Ukrainian troops to defend against Russian aggression. Ukrainian service members have also been receiving military training under other initiatives led either by national governments of partner countries or the EU. British soldiers have been warned that Russia may be using spies and drones to gather intelligence on Ukrainian service members trained in the U.K., according to a report by The Times on Aug. 5.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-50-000-ukrainian-recruits-receive-training-in-uk/	2024-11-19T04:49:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1635574120.jpg
Better late than never: Israeli companies finally reach out to Ukraine to help fight Iranian drones	Editor&#x2019;s note: This article was originally published in the Israeli investigative outlet Shomrim. The Kyiv Independent is republishing it with permission. After Israeli officials earlier ignored Ukrainian warnings and offers to help counter the threat of Iranian drones, the tides appear to be turning as Israel faces increased drone attacks amid escalating tensions in the region. After talking with dozens of officials and key individuals in the defense technology sector, Israeli investigative outlet Shomrim has found that contacts and early signs of collaboration are emerging in this field. Israeli defense tech companies are seeking proven solutions that have been tested in real combat situations. Shomrim and N12 revealed earlier this year that long before the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, Ukrainian officials had reached out to their counterparts in Israel to share their experience countering the threat of Iranian-made drones since Russia began using the weapon against Ukraine in 2022. A former senior Ukrainian official said that at least one Ukrainian company developing anti-drone technology sent representatives to Israel before the outbreak of the war in Gaza &#x2014; but could not find a single counterpart from the defense sector in Israel willing to meet with them. &#x201C;Not a single company agreed to meet with them at their office,&#x201D; said the former official, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversations. &#x201C;Someone did agree to meet with them at a fast-food restaurant and I believe that was the only meeting. It was a humiliating experience.&#x201D; Both current and former Israeli and Ukrainian officials said that Israel paid a heavy price for dismissing those warnings. The Iranian-made drones that are being launched at Israel from Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, and Iran itself have led to casualties, destruction, fires, and panic and are now the main challenge currently facing Israel&#x2019;s aerial defense systems. The extent of the threat was underscored by the drone that hit and damaged the private residence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Caesarea. The Ukrainian companies, for their part, are hoping to grow and profit from the Israeli companies&#x2019; international contacts. Ukraine gained experience from almost three years of war, with over 7,000 drones launched from Russia into Ukraine since the beginning of 2024, including about 2,000 in October alone.

(Sergey Bobok / AFP via Getty Images)For comparison, the Israeli army recently reported that since Oct. 7, 2023, about 1,300 drones have been launched against Israel from all fronts combined: Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Iran. The war against Russia, together with large investments from both the private and public sectors, has turned Ukraine into a hotbed of global innovation when it comes to the defense tech sector, with a proliferation of companies offering groundbreaking solutions to identify and intercept drones. The industry has attracted the attention of Western nations, including private companies. Some firms have opened business offices in Ukraine, while others have forged close ties with Ukrainian companies. Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 led to an exponential and fast-paced development of the Ukrainian defense industry, said Olena Bilousova, a senior researcher at the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE). When Ukraine first started dealing with the challenge posed by drones from Russia, it set up a dedicated national industry, spearheaded by its Digital Transformation Ministry, to find a solution. There are now more than 200 Ukrainian companies working in the field. &#x201C;As far as military companies are concerned, there is nowhere in the world like Ukraine, since it offers them an opportunity to test their products on the battlefield against an enemy as mighty as Russia, which also has advanced technologies,&#x201D; said Bilousova. Zvook, a ground-breaking Ukrainian start-up in the field of AI-powered acoustic detection of incoming drones, missiles, and other aerial threats, is among the companies establishing ties with Israeli partners. Maryan Sulym, head of Zvook and a Ukrainian military air defense sergeant, said that his company relies on small acoustic sensors the size of a small box placed on cellphone towers and in hidden locations along the front line. Each sensor can detect Iranian Shahed drones within a range of three to five kilometers and cruise missiles within five to seven kilometers. Today, Sulym said, Zvook&#x2019;s network covers about 5% of the territory of Ukraine &#x2014; an area larger than the whole of Israel. The data collected from the sensors is impressively accurate, with false positive rates of only 2.5%. According to Sergeant Sulym, Zvook&#x2019;s innovative approach has attracted attention from international actors, including NATO countries. U.S. Air Force General James Hecker, commander of U.S. air operations in Europe, recently commended Ukraine&apos;s acoustic detection systems, highlighting how these low-cost devices &#x2014; about a thousand dollars per sensor &#x2014; can accurately gauge the speed, direction, and velocity of incoming drones. Zvook has also attracted interest in Israel and has been approached by at least three Israeli defense technology firms. One of the inquiries was made in recent weeks, shortly after a drone crashed into the Israeli Prime Minister&apos;s residence. Representatives of this Israeli company are set to visit Ukraine in the near future, in order to closely examine Zvook&#x2019;s acoustic technology. Another meeting was held last month online, between a Ukrainian company specializing in first-person-view drones and robotics and a group of Israeli entrepreneurs in the security field. It is not yet known whether the meeting will lead to actual contracts, but one of the participants in the call said that there was a definite interest in the transfer of knowledge and that the Israelis asked the Ukrainian entrepreneur numerous questions concerning, among other things, Ukrainian efforts to intercept Iranian Shahed drones, according to the paricipant, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity to freely discuss the call. Vladimir Davidoff, founder and CEO of Dronex Israel, which manufactures reusable interceptor drones, cautions that the technologies developed by Ukrainian companies are not necessarily suitable for Israel&apos;s needs. &#x201C;In Ukraine, response time from detection to action can be hours, whereas here in Israel, we have minutes or even seconds,&#x201D; he said, due to the vast size difference between the two countries. The Ukrainian experience can still prove meaningful, according to Davidoff. The lack of direct encounters with drones in real combat situations has proven detrimental to the Israeli Defense Force&#x2019;s readiness against drones, Davidoff said. &#x201C;You can only be certain your system works after it is tested in real combat conditions,&quot; said Davidoff. &quot;In Israel, our expectations (about how well it was protected from drones) were somewhat inflated, and we need more solutions specifically tailored to the complexities of drone threats.&#x201D; Davidoff is well acquainted with the war zones in both Israel and Ukraine. He worked in Ukraine after the start of the Russian full-scale invasion and redirected his company&apos;s activities to the defense sector. He recently relocated his activity in Israel, and has been working alongside MAFAT &#x2014; the IDF&#x2019;s Directorate of Defense, Research, and Development &#x2014; while relying on his experience in Ukraine and the knowledge he acquired there.

(Fatemeh Bahrami/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)One of his companies, which operates in Europe, recently concluded an agreement and bought samples from a Ukrainian manufacturer of acoustic sensors that operates from another nearby country in Europe. He did not name the country, citing security concerns. &quot;If the sensors pass tests in Israel, we can produce them together in Israel,&quot; he said, in an example of direct cooperation between Ukrainian and Israeli defense companies. The cooperation between Davidoff&#x2019;s firm and his Ukrainian counterpart illustrates a type of circumvention that Ukrainian companies are currently employing given Ukraine&apos;s ban on military exports since the outbreak of the war. Ukraine adopted this ban to ensure that all available Ukrainian weaponry would be used against the Russian invasion. According to Bilousova of KSE, more and more Ukrainian companies are already circumventing the export ban by transferring production to other countries and opening their headquarters in countries close to Ukraine, such as Poland and Estonia. The Ukrainian government has recently indicated that it may be willing to overturn the ban and allow arms exports, including anti-drone systems. This could pave the way for broader cooperation between Ukrainian companies and Israel. Yevhen Korniychuk, Ukraine&#x2019;s ambassador in Israel, confirmed the ongoing cooperation between Israel and Ukrainian companies but declined to go into details, citing the sensitivity of the subject. &#x201C;Israeli private companies and state defense firms are quite actively communicating with their Ukrainian counterparts right now,&#x201D; he said. In this context, Elbit, one of Israel&#x2019;s largest military companies, was mentioned by Korniychuk. Ukraine&#x2019;s ambassador helped introduce Elbit representatives to officials from the Ukrainian Defense Ministry. Another Israeli company is R2, which has developed a product for identifying and locating drones and is taking part in exercises with NATO. R2 is currently in touch with Brave1, a Ukrainian government platform whose purpose is to test and develop advanced military technology. Western governments usually tend to encourage and support such collaborations between private defense companies in their countries and Brave1, but the CEO of the Israeli company noted that the connection to the Ukrainian platform has been made independently and without the involvement of the IDF or the Defense Ministry. The Ukrainian ambassador describes the cooperation between Ukrainian and Israeli firms as a force multiplier, emphasizing that this synergy should have been initiated long ago. &#x201C;One plus one&#x2014;Israel plus Ukraine&#x2014;equals three or four, not two. Israel brings technological knowledge as well as access to American technologies. We have vast combat experience. We need to combine all of that, of course. This cooperation should have taken place long ago,&#x201D; the ambassador said.	https://kyivindependent.com/better-late-than-never-israeli-companies-finally-reach-out-to-ukraine-to-help-fight-iranian-drones/	2024-11-19T04:49:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1682387939.jpg
Ukraine used ATACMS on Russian territory for first time, according to Moscow, media	The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Nov. 19 that Ukraine launched U.S.-made ATACMS missiles against Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast, according to the state news agency TASS. This coincides with several Ukrainian media outlets reporting that, according to undisclosed military sources, Ukraine successfully struck a Russian military facility in Karachev, Bryansk Oblast. If confirmed, this would mark the first instance of Ukraine using U.S.-made long-range missiles on Russian territory since Washington eased the restrictions last week. Kyiv&apos;s forces have previously deployed the weaponry only against Russian targets in occupied Ukrainian territories. The claims could not be independently verified. A Ukrainian military representative declined to comment on the reports for the Kyiv Independent. Ukrainian officials previously reported an attack with unspecified weaponry against a Russian arsenal in Karachev overnight on Nov. 19, which reportedly stored artillery ammunition, including North Korean munitions, KAB guided bombs, anti-aircraft missiles, and rocket launcher ammunition. Twelve secondary explosions could be heard at around 2:30 a.m., the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. Karachev residents reported explosions and detonations, including an alleged attack on a &quot;military base,&quot; as shared in local chats and reported by Russian media outlet Astra. The town lies more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the Ukrainian border. ATACMS missiles have a maximum range of 300 kilometers (190 miles). In turn, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed that its forces shot down five and damaged one ATACMS missile. Missile fragments fell on a military facility in Bryansk Oblast and started a fire but inflicted &quot;no casualties or damage,&quot; the ministry claimed. Unnamed U.S. officials, as well as a source familiar with the decision, who spoke to Reuters following the decision earlier this week, said that Kyiv plans to conduct its first long-range strikes in the coming days. Commenting on the reports, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the &quot;missiles will speak for themselves.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-media-claim-ukraine-used-atacms-in-russia-for-first-time/	2024-11-19T04:24:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1430567925.jpg
Russia's FSB reports detentions over Crimea car bombing	Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB) on Nov. 19 announced the detention of two residents of Russian-occupied Crimea in connection with a car bombing in Sevastopol on Nov. 13 that killed Russian Navy officer Valery Trankovsky. A source from the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent at the time that Trankovsky was responsible for missile strikes against Ukrainian cities and his killing was a result of an SBU operation. According to the FSB, a 38-year-old resident of Sevastopol tracked Trankovsky&#x2019;s car, while a 47-year-old resident of Yalta reportedly constructed and placed an improvised explosive device under the vehicle. Authorities claimed to have found 1.2 kilograms of explosives, equivalent to TNT, in the 47-year-old suspect&apos;s garage. Trankovsky was chief of staff of the 41st Missile Boat Brigade and a &quot;war criminal who has ordered cruise missile launches from the Black Sea against civilian sites in Ukraine,&quot; the source said. The officer was allegedly responsible for the Kalibr missile strike against the city of Vinnytsia in July 2022 that killed 29 people and injured over 200 more. He also oversaw strikes against Odesa and other cities, leaving many civilians dead, the source said. This incident is part of a broader pattern of Russian military officers involved in the war against Ukraine being killed in Russia or Russian-occupied territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-fsb-reports-detentions-over-crimea-car-bombing/	2024-11-19T04:03:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Baza-2.jpg
Ukraine aims to produce 30,000 long-range drones, 3,000 missiles, Zelensky says	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Nov. 19 that Ukraine plans to increase the production of long-range drones and missiles as part of the country&apos;s resilience plan. In a speech to the parliament, Zelensky said that the drones would help compensate for the army&#x2019;s lack of artillery. Ukraine aims to produce at least 30,000 long-range drones next year, and a new technology center will be established. The president also set the task of producing 3,000 cruise missiles and drone-missile hybrids and finding an effective countermeasure to Russian Shahed-type drones. The statement follows an earlier announcement on Oct. 21, when Zelensky revealed that the U.S. is preparing to allocate an aid package worth $700-800 million to support Ukraine&#x2019;s domestic production of long-range capabilities. In addition to drones, Ukraine is advancing its missile development. Zelensky previously said that the country successfully tested its first domestically made ballistic missile. Zelensky has also revealed that Ukraine had developed another domestic-made weapon, a missile-drone Palianytsia. He said it has already been used against Russia. The first successful use of the Palianytsia missile was confirmed by Zelensky during his Independence Day speech on Aug. 24. Ukraine has been developing its own long-range capabilities in lieu of Western long-range arms, the use of which has been restricted by Kyiv&apos;s international partners. Only last week did Washington allow the use of ATACMS missiles on Russian soil, marking a significant policy shift.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-missiles-drones/	2024-11-19T03:37:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177157663.jpg
Russian attack against Kharkiv injures 3	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched an attack against the Kyivskyi district of Kharkiv on Nov. 19, injuring three people, Mayor Ihor Terekhov reported. The full consequences of the attack are being determined.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-against-kharkiv/	2024-11-19T03:27:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2114357693.jpg
Long-range strikes can help push Russia toward peace, US official says	U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Brian A. Nichols indirectly acknowledged on Nov. 18 that U.S. President Joe Biden had authorized Ukraine to use American weapons to strike Russian territory. &quot;The weapons President Biden authorized Ukraine to use will give it more capabilities to defend itself and, hopefully, make the Russian Federation understand that using force to seize Ukrainian territory will not succeed,&quot; Nichols said in an interview with the Brazilian newspaper O Globo, responding to a question about Biden easing restrictions. His comments followed reports saying Biden had authorized Ukraine to use American-supplied ATACMS missiles for strikes inside Russia, marking a notable shift in U.S. policy. Officials in Kyiv and Washington have been largely evasive when asked about the reports. Nichols reiterated that the war could end immediately if Russia withdrew its forces and respected Ukraine&apos;s borders, calling Moscow&#x2019;s invasion &quot;unprovoked.&quot; &quot;The war began with Russia&#x2019;s new unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. The conflict in Ukraine could end right now if Russia withdrew its troops from Ukraine and respected Ukraine&#x2019;s borders,&quot; Nichols said. The EU&apos;s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, said after a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Nov. 18 that Washington had &quot;authorized the use of its weapons up to 300 kilometers (190 miles) inside Russian territory.&quot; This distance coincides with the estimated range of ATACMS missiles. Unnamed U.S. officials and a source familiar with the decision told Reuters that Ukraine plans to conduct its first long-range strikes in the coming days without providing operational details. Another source confirmed to Axios that the strikes are limited to Kursk Oblast and that the decision was communicated to Kyiv three days earlier, Axios reported on Nov. 18.	https://kyivindependent.com/long-range-strikes-can-help-push-russia-toward-peace-us-official-says/	2024-11-19T03:12:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1494251875.jpg
Russia claims to capture village near Kurakhove, Kyiv hasn't confirmed	Russian forces claim to have taken the front-line village of Novoselydivka in Donetsk Oblast on Nov. 19. Ukraine has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified. Novoselydivka lies some 7 kilometers (4 miles) north of Kurakhove, an important stronghold of Ukrainian forces in the area that has seen increasingly heavy Russian assaults in the past months. If confirmed, this will be the latest village that the Russian forces took in their attempt to encircle Kurakhove by driving their forces towards Konstiantynopil with a north-south pincer movement. The estimated Russian advance in Novoselydivka, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Nov. 18, 2024, according to the DeepState monitoring service (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)With the best Ukrainian brigades holding Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, Russian troops move forward along the Donetsk front line at a rate not seen since the early weeks of the war. The victory of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in early November adds further uncertainty to Kyiv&#x2019;s military prospects to hold its defenses across the 1,200-kilometer-long (750 miles) front line as doubt over Washington&#x2019;s future military aid looms. Outgoing President Joe Biden&#x2019;s decision to allow Ukraine to use Western-supplied ATACMS to strike targets deep inside Russia may help in the short run but will not change the general course of the war, observers said.	https://kyivindependent.com/novoselydivka/	2024-11-19T02:54:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2176747572.jpg
Severed internet cables raise suspicion of sabotage in Baltic Sea	Telecom cables linking two Nordic countries with Germany and Lithuania were cut on the bottom of the Baltic Sea, raising suspicion of sabotage, various media outlets reported on Nov. 18. While the circumstances of the incident remain unclear, the reports come amid mounting warnings of Russian hybrid and sabotage operations across Western countries, namely in the Baltic Sea region. One of the cables, a 1,200-kilometer (750-mile) long one linking Helsinki with the German port of Rostock, stopped working on Nov. 18, while the shorter, a 218-kilometer-long (135 miles) link between Lithuania and Sweden&#x2019;s Gotland Island, went out of service on Nov. 17, The Guardian reported. Gotland, Sweden&apos;s largest island, is located about 330 kilometers (around 200 miles) north of the Russian exclave Kaliningrad, the headquarters of Russia&apos;s Baltic Fleet, and is strategically important for the defense of the Baltic Sea region. &quot;We are deeply concerned about the severed undersea cable connecting Finland and Germany in the Baltic Sea. The fact that such an incident immediately raises suspicions of intentional damage,&quot; a joint statement by Germany and Finland read. The parties announced an investigation. &quot;Our European security is not only under threat from Russia&apos;s war of aggression against Ukraine but also from hybrid warfare by malicious actors,&quot; the statement added. This incident comes a little more than two years after unknown actors blew up the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines.	https://kyivindependent.com/severed-internet-cables-raise-suspicion-of-sabotage-in-baltic-sea/	2024-11-19T02:32:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182217094--1-.jpg
Zelensky presents Ukraine's resilience plan to parliament	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky unveiled Ukraine&apos;s 10-point plan for internal resilience in an address to the parliament on Nov. 19. The individual points were focused on the country&apos;s unity, front-line situation, arms, finances, energy, security, communities, human capital, cultural sovereignty, and veterans, lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said on his Telegram channel.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-presents-ukraines-resilience-plan-to-parliament/	2024-11-19T01:58:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/29feee4480122502cb728f1cc8bdac91_1659015958_extra_large.jpeg
Duda accuses Scholz of sidelining Trump in Ukraine peace efforts	Polish President Andrzej Duda accused German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Nov. 18 of undermining U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s potential role in Ukraine peace negotiations to rebuild Germany&#x2019;s ties with Russia. Duda suggested that Scholz&#x2019;s recent phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin was an attempt to secure a ceasefire in Ukraine before Trump takes office. &quot;I believe it was an attempt to bring about a ceasefire in Ukraine before Donald Trump took office,&quot; Duda said in an interview in Warsaw, as quoted by Bloomberg. Scholz defended the call as an effort to encourage peace talks with Ukraine, but it drew criticism from Kyiv and its allies. The Polish president has traditionally fostered warm ties with Trump, who pledged to end the war &quot;within 24&quot; hours and bring both sides to the negotiating table. Duda sought to dispel concerns about Trump abandoning Ukraine, saying the U.S. president-elect &quot;does not like to lose.&quot; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned on Nov. 15 against negotiations that might ease Russia&apos;s isolation without achieving meaningful results. &quot;It is extremely important for Putin to loosen his isolation, Russia&apos;s isolation, and to conduct ordinary negotiations that will not result in anything &#x2014; as he has been doing for decades,&quot; Zelensky said. Earlier, Trump announced that he may &quot;soon&quot; appoint a Ukrainian peace envoy to lead negotiations on ending Russia&apos;s war, Fox News reported on Nov. 13. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia held talks in Belarus and Turkey in early 2022, but the negotiations were eventually abandoned after Ukraine retook the north of the country and mass war crimes were discovered in the liberated areas.	https://kyivindependent.com/duda-scholz-trump/	2024-11-19T01:50:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1251957530.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 25, injure 79 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least 25 people and injured at least 79 over the past day, with children and police officers among the casualties, regional authorities reported on Nov. 19. Russian forces launched a ballistic missile attack against the port city of Odesa on Nov. 18, killing at least 10 people and injuring 55. &#x200B;&#x200B;The fatalities included seven police officers, a medic, and two civilian residents. Among the injured were at least 14 law enforcement officers and four children, two of them aged 7, 10, and two 11-year-olds. A Russian drone attack in Sumy Oblast late on Nov. 18 killed at least 10 people, including a child, and injured at least 13 people, including three children, the State Emergency Service reported on Nov. 19. The drone attack struck a dormitory building of an educational institution in the town of Hlukhiv at around 11:20 p.m. local time, authorities said. More people may remain trapped under the rubble. In Kharkiv Oblast&#x2019;s Hoptivka village, Russian attacks injured a 52-year-old man and a 59-year-old woman, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported on his Telegram channel. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian attacks killed three people and injured seven, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on his Telegram channel. In Kherson Oblast, dozens of villages and the city of Kherson came under attack, as a result of which two people were killed and two were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. Russia launched at least 87 drones overnight, of which Ukrainian air defenses shot down 51 across nine regions, the Air Force said. Thirty drones were lost across Ukraine thanks to active countermeasures, the statement read.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-6/	2024-11-19T01:35:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Odesa-Nov-18.jpg
Putin approves Russia's updated nuclear doctrine	Russian President Vladimir Putin approved updated principles of Russia&apos;s nuclear deterrence policy, according to a presidential decree published on a government website on Nov. 19. The revised doctrine outlines scenarios that could justify a nuclear strike. It implies that this could include &quot;aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies by a non-nuclear state with the support of a nuclear state&quot; and large-scale non-nuclear attacks, such as those carried out with drones. Putin first proposed changes to the nuclear doctrine during a Sept. 25 Security Council meeting on nuclear deterrence. He claimed that Russia does not need a preventative strike as part of its nuclear doctrine &quot;because, in a retaliatory strike, the enemy will be guaranteed to be destroyed.&quot; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the changes should be seen as a &quot;certain signal&quot; to the West. &quot;This is a signal that warns these countries of the consequences if they take part in an attack on our country by various means, not necessarily nuclear,&quot; Peskov told the state-run RIA Novosti on Sept. 26. Since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has repeatedly issued nuclear threats against Ukraine and the West. The threats have failed to materialize, and Russia continues to wage its all-out war without using its nuclear arsenal.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-approves-russias-updated-nuclear-doctrine/	2024-11-19T00:41:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2151313411.jpg
West marks 1,000 days of Russia’s full-scale war with solidarity with Ukraine	Western leaders, officials, and diplomats expressed support for Ukraine on Nov. 19, the 1,000 days since Russia launched its full-scale invasion. On Feb. 24, 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, extending its aggression beyond the partially occupied Donbas region and Crimea in an attempt to seize the entire country. Ukraine on Nov. 19 marked 1,000 days of full-scale war with Russia. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that EU buildings were illuminated with Ukrainian flags in tribute to the country&apos;s defenders. &quot;In 2022, Russia thought its full-scale invasion would end in days. 1,000 days later, Ukraine bravely resists. On the battlefield. And against criminal attacks on civilian targets. Tonight our buildings adorn the Ukrainian flag to honor the brave men and women of Ukraine,&quot; von der Leyen wrote on X. Patrick Turner, NATO&apos;s senior representative in Ukraine, praised Ukraine&apos;s resilience, calling it a powerful inspiration for the world. &quot;NATO remains by your side, today and every day,&quot; Turner said. Lithuanian Defense Minister Laurynas Kasciunas highlighted Ukraine&#x2019;s steadfastness and reiterated Lithuania&#x2019;s continued support. &quot;Ukraine can always count on us. Together, we will celebrate victory,&quot; he said. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield announced plans for new defense assistance for Ukraine &quot;in the coming days,&quot; calling on U.N. member states to back Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s peace formula. &quot;Until then, and at the direction of the President, the United States will continue to surge security assistance to Ukraine, including artillery, air defense, armored vehicles, and other needed capabilities and munitions. And we will announce additional security assistance for Ukraine in the days to come,&quot; the ambassador said.	https://kyivindependent.com/west-marks-1-000-days-of-russias-full-scale-war-with-solidarity-with-ukraine/	2024-11-19T00:27:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Europe.jpg
Ukraine strikes Russian ammunition depot in Bryansk Oblast, military says	Ukrainian forces struck an arsenal of a Russian logistics center in the town of Karachev in Bryansk Oblast overnight on Nov. 19, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. The announcement comes shortly after Russian authorities reported drone strikes against the border region, claiming there has been no damage or casualties. Twelve drones were destroyed over the territory of Bryansk Oblast by Russian air defenses on Nov. 19, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed. Bryansk Oblast Governor Alexander Bogomaz said the attack caused no casualties or significant damage. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the reports. Karachev residents reported explosions and detonations, including an alleged attack on a &quot;military base,&quot; as shared in local chats and reported by Russian media outlet Astra. Twelve secondary explosions could be heard at around 2:30 a.m., the General Staff reported. &quot;The destruction of Russian ammunition warehouses in order to stop Russian aggression against Ukraine will continue,&quot; the military said in a statement. Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s counter-disinformation center at the National Security and Defense Council, claimed the attack targeted the 67th arsenal of Russia&apos;s Main Missile and Artillery Directorate. The official said the facility stored artillery ammunition, including North Korean munitions, KAB guided bombs, anti-aircraft missiles, and rocket launcher ammunition. Russia attacked Ukraine&#x2019;s northeastern Sumy Oblast on Nov. 18, which borders Bryansk Oblast, killing at least seven people, including a child, and injuring 12 others. Ukrainian forces have frequently targeted Russian border regions to diminish Russian attacks within Ukraine&apos;s borders.	https://kyivindependent.com/bryansk-oblast-arsenal/	2024-11-18T23:31:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2150742300.jpg
Georgian police disperse protesters in Tbilisi	Georgian police dispersed a protest in Tbilisi demanding new elections on the eve of Nov. 18, but organizers promised a quick resumption elsewhere. The protests came as part of the pro-EU opposition&#x2019;s refusal to recognize the electoral victory claimed by the ruling Georgian Dream party, which has close ties to Russia. The disputed results have triggered large-scale protests in Tbilisi. &quot;We will liberate this country from them without using force. This is Georgia, this is Europe, this is not Russia. How long should we educate freedom-loving people? It will never end, it has not ended for thousands of years, and it will not end even now,&quot; Nika Melia, one of the opposition leaders, was quoted as saying by News Georgia. Protesters occupied a busy junction of downtown Tbilisi on Nov. 17 with tents, but the police dispersed them a day later, citing an insufficient number of protesters. &quot;A representative of the Interior Ministry previously warned the political leaders about the planned measures. He urged them to leave the territory, justifying the demand by the fact that there were not enough demonstrators to block the road,&quot; Georgia&#x2019;s Interior Ministry was quoted as saying by Interfax Ukraine in a statement. Official election results showed Georgian Dream securing nearly 54% of the vote, but opposition leaders and international observers have highlighted widespread allegations of intimidation, ballot-stuffing, and vote-buying. Georgian Dream has faced accusations of democratic backsliding and steering the South Caucasus country closer to the Kremlin. Earlier this year, the controversial &quot;foreign agents&quot; law sparked mass protests and violent crackdowns by police. Following the election, the European Commission announced the suspension of Georgia&#x2019;s EU accession process, highlighting the growing rift between Tbilisi and the West.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-police-disperse-protesters-in-tbilisi/	2024-11-18T23:15:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2181587481.jpg
Macron praises Biden's decision to ease limits on Ukraine's long-range strikes	French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s decision to allow Ukraine to strike targets in Russia with long-range American missiles, calling it &quot;a good decision&quot; on Nov. 18. Macron said the move was a response to Russia escalating the war by deploying North Korean soldiers. &quot;Russia is the only power that made an escalatory decision ... it&apos;s really this break that led to the U.S. decision,&quot; Macron said, as reported by Politico on Nov. 19. Media reports on Nov. 17 suggested that President Biden allowed Ukraine to use ATACMS missiles against military targets in Russia, focusing on Russian and North Korean forces in Kursk Oblast. The EU&apos;s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, confirmed on Nov. 18 that the &quot;Biden administration had authorized the use of its weapons up to 300 kilometers (190 miles) inside Russian territory.&quot; Earlier this year, Macron backed Ukraine&#x2019;s right to strike military targets in Russia, saying Moscow was taking advantage of Western missile restrictions. France has previously supplied Ukraine with its SCALP/T missiles, which have been deployed against Russian targets in occupied territories. Ukraine has repeatedly urged Western allies for long-range missiles and approval to target Russia, a crucial part of President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s five-point victory plan. Biden&#x2019;s decision comes just weeks before leaving office. President-elect Donald Trump will take over on Jan. 20, 2025, possibly overturning years of U.S. policy on Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-praises-biden/	2024-11-18T22:59:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2033880055.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 724,050 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 724,050 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Nov. 19. This number includes 1,610 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,382 tanks, 19,092 armored fighting vehicles, 29,548 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,632 artillery systems, 1,252 multiple launch rocket systems, 999 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 19,111 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-724-050-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-11-18T22:23:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1958294777.jpg
Ukraine marks 1000 days of full-scale war	Ukraine on Nov. 19 marked 1,000 days of full-scale war with Russia. Russian forces launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, extending their aggression beyond the occupied Donbas region in an attempt to bring the entire country under Moscow&apos;s control. &quot;For 1,000 days, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have been confronting the enemy on the front line, which stretches over 1,000 kilometers,&quot; Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Nov. 19. &quot;In the frozen trenches of Donetsk Oblast and in the burning steppes of Kherson Oblast under shells, hail, and anti-aircraft guns, we are fighting for the right to life. For us and our children.&quot; The milestone comes as Ukraine braces for a difficult and uncertain winter. Russia on Nov. 17 launched one of its largest aerial attacks yet against Ukraine&apos;s energy grid, leaving civilians dead and injured across multiple regions. The future of U.S. military aid to Ukraine is also in question, as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office in January. Meanwhile, thousands of Russian and North Korean forces have amassed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, preparing to launch a counteroffensive against Ukrainian troops. The escalating situation in Kursk reportedly prompted U.S. President Joe Biden to grant Ukraine permission to use American long-range weapons on Russian territory. &quot;Every dark night, even if there are a thousand of them, always ends with dawn,&quot; Syrskyi said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-marks-1000-days-war/	2024-11-18T21:59:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184805574.jpg
Russian attack on Sumy Oblast kills 6, injures 12, including children	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story. A Russian drone attack in Sumy Oblast on Nov. 18 killed at least six people, including a child, and injured at least 12 others, the regional military administration reported. The drone struck an apartment building in the town of Hlukhiv at around 11:20 p.m. local time, authorities said. Six people were killed in the attack, including one child, the administration reported. At least 12 others were injured, including two children, as of 7 a.m. on Nov. 19. Rescue workers are still searching for more people who may be buried beneath the rubble. Ukraine&apos;s northeastern Sumy Oblast borders Russia&apos;s Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod oblasts. Residents of the vulnerable border communities endure daily Russian attacks, prompting mass evacuations from the region. During Russia&apos;s large-scale aerial attack against Ukraine overnight on Nov. 17, the regional capital Sumy &#xA0;came under heavy fire, with Russia launching multiple missile strikes on the city. The attack targeted residential areas, killing 11 people, including two children.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-sumy-oblast/	2024-11-18T21:39:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/drone.jpg
Dutch FM welcomes US decision to allow long-range strikes against Russia	U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s reported decision to allow Kyiv to strike targets in Russia with long-range American missiles is a welcome step in support of Ukraine&apos;s defense, Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp said on Nov. 18. Veldkamp only regrets that the decision was leaked to the media. &quot;I would have preferred it to be a surprise for the Russians,&quot; Veldkamp said, according to the Dutch news outlet NL Times. &#xA0; Several media outlets reported on Nov. 17 that Biden has granted permission for Ukraine to use its ATACMS missiles to strike military targets on Russian soil. According to some reports, the permissions extend only to Russian and North Korean forces amassing in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. The decision has not been publicly confirmed by Kyiv or Washington, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying that the &quot;missiles will speak for themselves.&quot; Speaking on the sidelines of the EU foreign ministers&apos; meeting in Brussels, Veldkamp said he approved of Washington&apos;s change in policy. &quot;This is an adequate response to the North Korean troop presence on the Russian side,&quot; he said. Moving the war onto the aggressor state&apos;s territory is valid under international law, Veldkamp said. &quot;The Netherlands has repeatedly advocated that weapons that we supply to Ukraine can also be deployed on Russian territory. After all, that is the territory of the aggressor.&quot; Ukraine has long pressed Western partners for long-range missiles and the permission to use them on Russian soil. Long-range strikes are a key component of Zelensky&apos;s five-point victory plan for Ukraine. Biden&apos;s decision comes in the final weeks of his presidency, as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to again take office on Jan. 20, 2025, potentially overturning years of U.S. policy on Ukraine. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/dutch-fm-welcomes-us-decision-to-allow-long-range-strikes-against-russia/	2024-11-18T20:41:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2162501104.jpg
Ukrainian musician Khlyvnyuk rejects Magnitsky Award, declines to share honor with Navalnaya	Ukrainian musician Andriy Khlyvnyuk on Nov. 18 declined to accept the Magnitsky Human Rights Award due to the statements of his co-recipient, Yulia Navalnaya, regarding Western military aid to Ukraine. Khlyvnyuk, lead singer of the Ukrainian music group BoomBox, joined Ukraine&apos;s Territorial Defense Force after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022 and now serves in the National Police. In a Facebook post published Nov. 18, Khlyvnyuk thanked the jurors of the Magnitsky Award, which honors journalists, activists, and politicians working to advance human rights. &quot;I sincerely thank all the founders and jury of the influential international Magnitsky Award in London,&quot; he said. &quot;You have noticed and noted my contribution to the race for freedom of speech and fundamental human rights, as part of the struggle for the independence of the Ukrainian state, which is insignificant compared to other people and foundations.&quot; Khlyvnyuk then explained that despite his gratitute, he could not accept the award, which was also offered to Russian opposition figure Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of the late dissident Alexei Navalny. &quot;(A)s the father of two children living under missile strikes and a private in the defense forces of Ukraine ... I cannot receive this award together with other laureates who are &apos;not sure&apos; of the need to provide my country with Western weapons, vitally necessary to repel Russian aggression,&quot; Khlyvnyuk said. Navalnaya said in an interview with the German outlet Zeit that she was not sure whether or not it was correct to supply arms to Ukraine. &quot;It&apos;s difficult to say,&quot; she said. &quot;The war was unleashed by Vladimir Putin, but the bombs are hitting Russians too.&quot; Following her husband&apos;s death in a Russian penal colony, Navalnaya has become a more visible leader in the Russian opposition movement. She received a 2024 Magnitsky Award under the category &quot;Courage Under Fire.&quot; Khlyvnyuk&apos;s statement comes a day after Russia on Nov. 17 unleashed one of its largest aerial attacks against Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war. The combined missile and drone attack targeted the country&apos;s energy grid and left multiple civilians dead or injured.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-musician-khlyvnyuk-rejects-magnitsky-award-declines-to-share-honor-with-navalnaya/	2024-11-18T19:53:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2162098256.jpg
President of Russian-occupied Abkhazia resigns amid protests	Aslan Bzhania, president of Georgia&apos;s Russian-occupied Abkhazia region, submitted a letter of resignation on Nov. 19 in an effort to make a deal with anti-government protesters. A controversial investment agreement with Russia sparked mass demonstrations in the regional capital city of Sukhum on Nov. 15, with demonstrators storming government buildings. The proposed law seeks to permit Russians to purchase property in Abkhazia. Abkhazia is internationally recognized as part of Georgia, but is under illegal Russian control. According to a resignation letter and announcement published by the Abkhaz president&apos;s press service, Bzhania&apos;s resignation will take effect once protesters withdraw and disperse from government property. If demonstrators do not comply, Bzhania said he would withdraw his resignation. The region&apos;s current vice president, Badra Gunba, is now acting president of Abkhazia, according to the announcement. Protesters in recent days began rallying outside the proxy parliament, denouncing the proposed law as one-sided and advantageous only to Russia. As demonstrations intensified, protesters reportedly threw eggs and bottles at police officers and used a car to breach part of the fence. The AMRA-Life Telegram channel also reported that Abkhaz opposition leader Levan Mykaa announced protesters would occupy the building until the president resigned.	https://kyivindependent.com/president-of-russian-occupied-abkhazia-resigns-amid-protests/	2024-11-18T19:00:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1718754754.jpg
Polish FM criticizes Hungary for supporting Russian aggression	Hungary is aiding Russian aggression by continuing to block military aid from the European Union, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said on the sidelines of the EU foreign ministers&apos; meeting in Brussels on Nov. 18. Budapest has been blocking the disbursement of Kyiv-bound assistance under the European Peace Facility (EPF) for more than a year, causing frustration among other member states. &quot;I would like to understand the reasons why Hungary does not want to help Ukraine, which is fighting for freedom, and wants to assist the aggressor in this conflict,&quot; Sikorski told reporters. Sikorski and other ministers from EU member nations convened in Brussels on Nov. 18 to address developments in Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, including U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s recent reported decision to allow Kyiv to use long-range American missiles on Russian targets and the future of military aid to Ukraine following the election of Donald Trump. The ministers did not come to a solution on releasing EPF funds for Ukraine, Sikorski said. &quot;Unfortunately, I cannot tell you today that the European Peace Facility has been unblocked, because unfortunately it is still being vetoed by the Hungarian side, despite the fact that a mechanism has been created thanks to which Hungarian money would not have to go to help Ukraine.&quot; Sikorski said he appealed to members of Poland&apos;s Law and Justice party (PiS) to work with Hungary&apos;s ruling Fidesz party, with whom they share political ties, to convince Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to change his position on EPF funds for Ukraine. &quot;I hope that (Polish) President Andrzej Duda will be more influential towards his friend, as he calls him, Donald Trump, than PiS has been so far towards Viktor Orban,&quot; he said. The EPF has been a key tool for supporting Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities since 2022 but was largely depleted earlier this year as member states disagreed on the best way to replenish it and unlock further cash for Ukraine. While the EU approved an additional 5 billion euros ($5.5 billion) for Ukraine in the spring, Budapest has been blocking their disbursement. A reform proposed in October would make financial contributions voluntary, potentially bypassing Hungary&apos;s veto. France and Germany remain skeptical of the plan&apos;s effectiveness, according to media reports. Orban is considered the EU&apos;s most Kremlin-friendly leader and has repeatedly stalled EU aid for Ukraine while blocking sanctions against Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-fm-criticizes-hungary-for-supporting-russian-aggression/	2024-11-18T17:59:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1241114232-1.jpg
EU widens sanctions on Iran for supporting Russia's war	The European Union expanded sanctions against Iran on Nov. 18 in response to Tehran&apos;s support for Russia in its war against Ukraine, according to the European Council. The council announced a &quot;transaction ban prohibiting any transaction with ports and locks that are owned, operated or controlled by listed individuals and entities or are used for the transfer of Iranian UAVs or missiles or related technology and components to Russia.&quot; The new measures also target the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) and its director, Mohammad Reza Khiabani. Reuters reported, citing Iran&apos;s official IRNA News Agency, that Ali Akbar Safaei, Managing Director of Iran&apos;s Ports and Maritime Organization, rejected the sanctions as &quot;baseless. &quot; The EU also imposed sanctions on three Russian shipping companies&#x2014;MG Flot, VTS Broker, and Arapax&#x2014;for delivering Iranian weapons, including drone components, across the Caspian Sea to bolster Russian troops in Ukraine. Earlier on Oct. 14, the EU adopted sanctions against seven individuals and seven entities over Iran&apos;s missile and drone shipments to Russia. Brussels joined the U.S. and other Western powers that have slapped sanctions on Iran after it was revealed that Tehran supplied Fath-360 close-range ballistic missiles to Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-widens-sanctions-on-iran-for-supporting-russias-war/	2024-11-18T15:22:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178315304.jpg
UNESCO condemns recent Russian attack on historic center of Odesa	UNESCO has condemned Russia&apos;s overnight strikes on Odesa&apos;s historic center overnight on Nov. 15, which damaged numerous architectural monuments, according to a statement on its official website. As a result of the Russian attack overnight on Nov. 15, a 35-year-old was killed. The strike also injured 10 people, with eight of them hospitalized with injuries of varying severity. &quot;UNESCO condemns these strikes, which contravene international law, and expresses its support for the victims, the population, and the local authorities,&quot; reads the statement published on Nov. 18. The historical center of the southern city of Odesa was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in January 2023. &quot;Once again, UNESCO is calling for an end to all attacks on cultural property protected under widely ratified international standard-setting instruments.&quot; A UNESCO mission led by Chiara Dezzi Bardeschi, head of the UNESCO Office in Ukraine, arrived on Nov. 16 to inspect the recently damaged cultural heritage sites. The organization has not yet provided the results of the assessments. Since the beginning of the all-out war, Russia has destroyed over 1,000 cultural heritage sites in Ukraine, including those under the protection of UNESCO, according to the Culture Ministry. In July 2023, the Russian missile strike damaged more than 20 architectural monuments in the historical center of Odesa and heavily damaged the Transfiguration Cathedral. On Oct. 28, &#xA0;the Russian bomb hit an iconic 13-story building situated in the very heart of Kharkiv, known as Derzhprom, or the State Industry House. Derzhprom was added to UNESCO&apos;s preliminary list in 2017 and was placed under provisional enhanced UNESCO protection after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. As of Oct. 21, UNESCO confirmed the damage to 457 sites, including 143 religious sites, 231 buildings of historical or artistic interest, 32 museums, 33 monuments, 17 libraries, and one archive.	https://kyivindependent.com/unesco-condemns-russian-recent-attack-on-historic-center-of-odesa/	2024-11-18T13:45:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/odesa2.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia hits residential area in Odesa, kills 10, injures 55	Key developments on Nov. 18: Russian forces launched a ballistic missile attack against the port city of Odesa on Nov. 18, killing at least 10 people and injuring 55. The killed included seven police officers, a medic, and two civilian residents. Among the injured were at least 14 law enforcement officers and four children, two of them aged 7, 10, and two 11-year-olds. The children are hospitalized and are in condition of moderate severity, Governor Oleh Kiper said. Thirty other people are hospitalized, of which three are in critical condition. Local authorities declared Nov. 19 a day of mourning in Odesa, Kiper said. The aftermath of a Russian missile attack against Odesa, Ukraine, on Nov. 18, 2024. (State Emergency Service/Telegram)The aftermath of a Russian missile attack against Odesa, Ukraine, on Nov. 18, 2024. (State Emergency Service/Telegram)&quot;After calls and meetings with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, after false media gossip about &apos;refraining&apos; from strikes, Russia shows what it is really interested in: only war,&quot; Zelensky said. The attack occurred shortly after Russia launched one of its largest mass strikes against Ukraine on Nov. 17 and deadly missile attacks against the city of Sumy overnight on Nov. 18. Odesa, lying on the Black Sea coast in southern Ukraine, is home to some 1 million residents. The port city has been repeatedly targeted throughout the full-scale war. The outgoing U.S. administration intends to provoke an escalation of the war in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the media on Nov. 18 following reports that Washington eased restrictions on long-range strikes. Peskov&apos;s words come as a Russian missile attack on Odesa hit a residential area, killing 10, and injuring 55 more. Several media outlets reported on Nov. 17 that U.S. President Joe Biden permitted Ukraine to use its ATACMS missiles to strike against targets on Russian soil. According to some reports, this so far concerns only Russian and North Korean forces amassing in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. &quot;You know, with the reports in Western media, it is obvious that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps... to add fuel to the fire and continue to provoke further escalation of tensions,&quot; Peskov said in response to a question whether the Kremlin can confirm that Washington took the step, RIA Novosti reported. The statement comes as Biden is set to leave office in January, with Donald Trump replacing him in the Oval Office. The Biden administration has pledged to deliver as much support to Ukraine as possible before Trump takes office. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is not planning to supply Ukraine with Taurus missiles despite the U.S. easing restrictions on long-range strikes, a government spokesperson told the AFP news agency on Nov. 18. Scholz has &quot;made his position clear&quot; on the matter and will &quot;not change his stance anymore,&quot; spokesperson Wolfgang Buchner said. Ukraine has previously received U.S.-made ATACMS and Storm Shadow/SCALP missiles from the U.K. and France, with a range of 300 kilometers (190 miles) and 250 kilometers (150 miles), respectively. In contrast, Scholz has been adamant about not supplying the Taurus cruise missiles, which boast a range of 500 kilometers (310 miles), fearing an escalation with Russia. Berlin&apos;s policy may soon shift as Germany heads toward snap elections on Feb. 23, with the center-right opposition alliance CDU/CSU currently leading the polls and threatening to oust Scholz. CDU/CSU&apos;s chancellor candidate, Friedrich Merz, said he would allow the delivery of Taurus missiles, but only if necessary after issuing an ultimatum to Russian President Vladimir Putin and lifting restrictions on arms that had already been provided. Similarly, Vice Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habeck, who is running for the chancellery for the Greens, said he would greenlight the delivery of the missiles if elected in February. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will propose his peace plan for Ukraine during the G20 talks commencing on Nov. 18, Bloomberg reported, citing undisclosed sources. Erdogan&apos;s proposal would include Ukraine foregoing joining NATO for at least 10 years, freezing the current front line, providing Ukraine with weapons, and deploying international troops to a demilitarized buffer zone in the Donbas, Bloomberg reported. The Turkish leader&apos;s proposal comes as NATO countries prepare for a Donald Trump presidency, which many fear will lead to the U.S. pressuring Ukraine to end the war quickly, even at the cost of territorial concessions. The G20 countries are set to convene in Brazil without the participation of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Brazil is a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which issued an arrest warrant for Putin last year for the abduction of Ukrainian children. &#x200C;&#x200C; Zelensky will also not be present, despite numerous appeals to receive an invitation.&#x200C;&#x200C; Zelensky said on Nov. 16 that Ukraine must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means in 2025.&#x200C;&#x200C; Zelensky&apos;s words followed Scholz&#x2019;s phone conversation with Putin, during which he condemned Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine and called to withdraw Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. He also urged Russia to negotiate with Ukraine to achieve a &quot;just and lasting peace.&quot; The call sparked anger in Ukraine, with Zelensky saying it could open a &quot;Pandora&apos;s Box&quot; for further engagement with the Russian leader. In the wake of Trump&apos;s election, Kyiv has urged its partners to adopt a &quot;peace through strength&quot; approach to pressure Russia toward a just peace. President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, currently lying some 6-7 kilometers from the front line, his Telegram channel reported on Nov. 18. Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub for Ukrainian forces in the east, has come into artillery and drone range of Russian forces moving relentlessly forward in Donetsk Oblast. With Moscow&apos;s troops drawing near, losing the town would be a serious blow to other parts of the front line&apos;s defense as well. &quot;A tense sector. It is only thanks to the strength of the soldiers that the east (of Ukraine) is not completely occupied by Russia. The enemy receives a response every day,&quot; &#xA0;Zelensky said. The head of state also visited the base of the 25th Airborne Brigade and handed out awards to soldiers. During his trip, Zelensky was accompanied by Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin, who called Pokrovsk &quot;one of the hottest spots&quot; of the front line. Zelensky has previously visited the most critical sectors of the front line during the full-scale war, including now Russian-occupied Bakhmut or Avdiivka. His visit aims to boost the morale among Ukrainian troops, who are increasingly on the back foot in the face of a Russian advance. The inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in January adds further uncertainty regarding the future of Ukrainian defense capabilities. Russian forces use cheap decoy drones with foreign components to overload Ukraine&apos;s air defense system, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Nov. 18. Russia has recently increased the number of large-scale drone attacks against Ukrainian cities, depleting Ukraine&apos;s air defense systems and targeting critical infrastructure. According to HUR, Russian manufacturers use components from the U.S., China, the Netherlands, and Switzerland to produce the Gerbera drone, a cheaper and less deadly equivalent of Iran&apos;s Shahed, at a plant in Yelabuga, in the Republic of Tatarstan, central Russia. The Gerbera drone can carry a combat payload similar to that of a kamikaze drone and conduct reconnaissance missions, particularly to detect air defense positions and record hits from other attack drones. The Gerbera is ten times cheaper than the Shahed or Geran drones due to the use of simple materials, such as plywood and foam. Yet, the drone contains a set of components from foreign manufacturers that &quot;are common for Russian weapons,&quot; according to HUR. Examination of the downed drones showed that Russia manufactures Gerberas based on a Chinese prototype using foreign components imported from China. The Gerbera drones were developed by the Chinese model aircraft manufacturer Skywalker Technology Co., Ltd., which also produces fuselages and organizes the supply of kits to Russia. The Gerbera&apos;s jamming-resistant antenna (CRPA) contains chips from Analog Devices and Texas Instruments, both made in the U.S., and NXP Semiconductors, made in the Netherlands. The flight controller also uses components manufactured by Texas Instruments, Atmel (USA), STMicroelectronics, U-Blox (Switzerland), NXP Semiconductors (Netherlands), and XLSEMI (China). The DLE60 engine is manufactured by the Chinese company Mile Hao Xiang Technology Co, Ltd. In the summer of 2024, the U.S. sanctioned this company for supplying Russia. Supplies are made through third-party companies, according to HUR. &quot;At this point, the biggest advantage that Russia may have in such attacks is sheer numbers of drones,&quot; Samuel Bendett, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security think tank, told the Kyiv Independent. Bendett mentioned the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in Russia&apos;s Republic of Tatarstan, where a Shahed-type drones plant is located. In May, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported, citing a contract leaked by the Prana Network hacker group, that the factory already produces 4,500 Shaheds and aims to increase this number to 6,000. &quot;It appears that Russian efforts in Alabuga have ensured that the Russian military has thousands such UAVs at its disposal along with other simpler, smaller variance identified recently that fly alongside these official Geran (Russian name for Shahed-type) UAVs,&quot; Bendett said. On Nov. 17, Russian forces launched one of the heaviest aerial strikes against the country throughout the full-scale war, primarily targeting the energy grid. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 102 of the 120 missiles and 42 of the 90 drones launched by Russia overnight.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russian-missile-attack-on-odesa-hits-residential-area-kills-10-injures-47/	2024-11-18T13:28:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-18_14-56-15.jpg
Ukraine aid key to battling Russian invasion — Can Europe fill the gap if Trump pulls the plug?	Amid rising fears of U.S. aid being cut off under a second Donald Trump presidency, Ukrainians are left wondering whether Europe can rise to the challenge and fill the gap. Trump has promised to swiftly end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, speaking highly of Russian President Vladimir Putin and making unflattering comments about his Ukrainian counterpart. Fears that Ukraine&apos;s top Western ally could pull the plug on aid that is key to fending off Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, now in its third year, swelled this past weekend when those close to the president-elect made a few jabs at Ukraine and its president. Donald Trump Jr., the son of the president-elect with a seemingly increasing influence, has publicly stated his opposition to Ukraine&apos;s right to use Western-provided weapons to hit targets inside Russia. &quot;The Military Industrial Complex seems to want to make sure they get World War III going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives,&quot; Trump Jr. wrote on X on Nov. 17, commenting on reports that outgoing President Joe Biden had authorized the use of U.S.-made ATACMS against targets inside Russia. As the decision came in the last months of Biden&apos;s term in office, it remains unclear whether Trump will uphold the policy after he returns to the White House.

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)And while Ukraine has a number of influential allies in Europe that would have the power to pick up where the U.S. might leave, doing so in the upcoming year would be a near-impossible task. &quot;Trump&apos;s victory could scarcely have come at a worse time,&quot; Nick Witney, a security expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Most European governments are in economic or political difficulties, or both.&quot; Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was a wake-up call for Europe. Since then, Europe&apos;s defense industry has increased its ammunition production capacity by 50%. It aims to produce over 2 million shells per year by the end of 2025 &#x2014; double its capacity in February 2022, according to the European Council of Foreign Relations. Stefan Wolff, professor of international security at the University of Birmingham, said that &quot;the EU defense industrial base has improved and will continue to improve, not least because it is now possible to allocate structural/cohesion funding to security projects within the EU.&quot; &quot;This will not benefit Ukraine directly, but it will likely mean more investment into defense capacity in general,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;This could then also benefit Ukraine but again not necessarily in the timeframe dictated by events in the U.S.&quot; Fabian Hoffmann, a defense policy expert at the University of Oslo&apos;s Oslo Nuclear Project, agreed that &quot;Europe has significantly ramped up production of some capabilities, such as 155mm artillery shells and other types of ammunition.&quot; &quot;In these areas, Europe could compensate relatively well, although the absence of U.S. assistance would, of course, still be felt,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. Hoffmann argued that, compared with the U.S., Europe does not have some crucial types of weapons needed by Ukraine. He said that the &quot;U.S. maintains a large reserve arsenal of tanks and infantry fighting vehicles that could be made available to Ukraine, whereas Europe lacks such reserves.&quot; The U.S. also has about 2,000 AGM-158A JASSM cruise missiles and another 2,000+ AGM-158B JASSM-ER cruise missiles in its arsenal, while &quot;European states do not have anywhere near that number of cruise missiles,&quot; he added. Moreover, the U.S. is &quot;the sole producer of interceptors for Patriot and NASAMS air defense systems,&quot; he said. &quot;If the U.S. were to withdraw as a supplier, Ukraine would face severe challenges in missile defense, particularly against ballistic missile threats,&quot; Hoffmann added.

(Lithuanian MOD / X)Europe producing more weaponry, but it&apos;s not enoughEven with the increase in military production of those weapons Europe is capable of offering without U.S. oversight, the deliveries have not been large enough to meet Ukraine&apos;s needs, analysts say. Pavel Havlicek, an expert on Russia and Ukraine at the Czech Republic&apos;s Association of International Affairs, argued that &quot;over the past two and half years, the EU proved very slow, even somehow lenient, to expand military production, massively increase military spending and investments, or boost its military industry.&quot; &quot;If you ask me if the EU can overnight replace the role of the U.S., it is absolutely no &#x2014; since the American backing is multilayered and strategic, including the air protection &#x2014; Patriot (air defense systems), mid- and long-range missiles that operate on the U.S. tech, including with their precision or intelligence gathering, which is key with limited resources at the battlefield,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Lucian Kim, senior analyst for Ukraine at the International Crisis Group, also said that Europe would not be able to fill the gap because &quot;Europe&apos;s militaries &#x2014; Germany&apos;s in particular &#x2014; are themselves under-armed, and Western allies lack both the stocks and production capacity to match the assistance Ukraine has been receiving from the U.S.&quot; He cited problems with the Czech-led initiative to supply artillery shells to Ukraine. The initiative, which was announced in early 2024, aims to deliver 1 million shells to Ukraine by the end of this year but it has faced delays. European Union&apos;s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, announced on Nov. 11 that the bloc had delivered 980,000 artillery shells to Ukraine out of the 1 million promised. He explained the shortfall, citing unexpected production capacity limits. Samantha de Bendern, an associate fellow at the Royal Institute of International Affairs at Chatham House, agreed that the EU was unlikely to fill the gap if the U.S. pulled the plug on aid. &quot;While the EU and its member states have made strides in increasing military aid and production, the stark reality remains that Europe cannot yet fill the void left by the United States, either in terms of its own defense or that of Ukraine,&quot; she told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;As long as perceived national interests continue to diverge and political stability wavers, particularly in key countries like Germany and France, Europe will struggle to forge a unified and effective response to the war raging on its continent.&quot; She also said that &quot;Europe is now in a position in which it cannot defend the country that has sacrificed tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of lives to defend not only its own territory but Europe as a whole.&quot; De Bendern said that European governments were under pressure from the electorate to spend money on health infrastructure and other public projects rather than Ukraine. &quot;The question for them is whether you spend money on Ukraine or build another hospital,&quot; she added. Apart from technical limitations, there are political problems that obstruct a further increase in Europe&apos;s aid for Ukraine. These include political instability in Germany, where Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos; coalition has collapsed. &quot;Germany, Europe&apos;s largest military donor to Ukraine, has plunged into political chaos with the collapse of the Scholz-led coalition. France&apos;s Emmanuel Macron, a staunch defender of Ukraine in spite of his initial impulses to seek a dialog with (Vladimir) Putin, has lost much of his freedom of action since the parliamentary elections in June in which he lost his parliamentary majority,&quot; De Bendern said. &quot;Elsewhere in Europe, political parties on the far right or far left of the political spectrum with pro-Russian sympathies are rising,&quot; De Bendern added. &quot;Already-fragile EU unity, a stalled Franco-German motor, a Trojan Horse in the shape of (Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor) Orban holding the presidency,&quot; Witney said, listing the problems the EU is facing. &quot;(All) will come under further pressure as individual states delude themselves they can build &apos;special relationships&apos; with Trump, and that supporting his agenda for Ukraine would be a good way to win favor.&quot; When asked for a comment, a spokesperson for the European Commission referred the Kyiv Independent to a Nov. 18 statement by Borrell, who said that &quot;we have to continue supporting Ukraine as much as we can and quicker, as quick as we can.&quot; France&apos;s President Emmanuel Macron (R) shakes hands with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky as he arrives prior to their meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris on Oct. 10, 2024.

In the EU, Germany is the biggest donor, with 12%. &quot;These figures speak for themselves: for the EU to replace the U.S., it would have to double the amount of military aid it gives to Ukraine,&quot; De Bendern said. &quot;The current political situation in Europe, as well as the real military capabilities of individual European countries, mean that Europe will not be able to step up in the short term.&quot; But it all boils down to the presence of political will. If there is a will, Europe will be able to at least partially fill the gap in case of a U.S. withdrawal, according to analysts. &quot;There is so much more Europe can afford to do or could do creatively with some more money, including the frozen Russian assets,&quot; Sascha Bruchmann, a military analyst at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It is the lack of political will and geopolitical na&#xEF;vet&#xE9;, not financial weakness, that holds Europe back.&quot; Susan Stewart, an expert at the Eastern Europe and Eurasia Division of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, said that, although the EU may not be able to undertake some projects as a bloc, some of its member states could create a coalition to boost support. &quot;There could be a sort of &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; of those states that see their own security as severely threatened and/or have shown unwavering support for Ukraine,&quot; she said. &quot;A possible beginning of this coalition may be indicated by the meetings Donald Tusk is planning with the leaders of the UK, France, and the Baltic and Nordic states. And it will certainly not hurt that Poland will take over the presidency of the EU for six months in January 2025.&quot; Stephen Hall, lecturer in Russian and post-Soviet politics at the University of Bath, argues that supporting Ukraine is vital for Europe&apos;s survival. &quot;Europe has to step up for its own safety as well,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. Yet it&apos;s up to the countries that understand the risks to do so, no matter what U.S. policy come January will be. A spokesperson for Rheinmetall, one of Germany&apos;s largest defense companies, said that it &quot;is a strategic partner of Ukraine and intends to support the country in the long term.&quot; &quot;This applies regardless of the outcome of the U.S. election,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Should the countries of Europe decide to increase their support for Ukraine in the future, Rheinmetall will do everything in its power to meet these increased demands as well.&quot; Martin Fornusek and Chris York contributed to this story.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-aid-key-to-battling-russian-invasion-can-europe-fill-the-gap-if-trump-pulls-the-plug/	2024-11-18T13:02:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2181862302.jpg
Borrell confirms US authorization for Ukraine to strike deep into Russia with missiles up to 300 km in range	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. The U.S. has authorized Ukraine to strike military targets deep inside Russian territory, the European Union&apos;s top diplomat Josep Borrell confirmed on Nov. 18 following a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels. &quot;The Biden administration has authorized the use of its weapons up to 300 kilometers inside Russian territory,&quot; he said. &quot;The American administration said no for a long time, and they ended up saying yes.&quot; Several media outlets reported on Nov. 17 that U.S. President Joe Biden permitted Ukraine to use its ATACMS missiles to strike against targets on Russian soil. According to some reports, this so far concerns only Russian and North Korean forces amassing in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Kyiv and Washington did not provide a clear statement on whether the authorization to strike deep into Russia with US-made missiles was granted. Borrell was the first official to confirm the move.Answering the question of why Joe Biden&apos;s administration decided to authorize long-range strikes against Russia now, Borrell said he did not know why the White House made this decision after the presidential election and not before. Borrell also confirmed that this permit was indeed granted and is spread over a distance of 300 kilometers (187 miles). &quot;It&apos;s not that much by way of a distance. It&apos;s not a very long distance. It doesn&apos;t go deep into the country, but this is the decision by the administration,&quot; the diplomat said. &quot;I think it&apos;s reasonable to provide arms, not just to stop the arrows, but also to fight the bowmen,&quot; Borrell added. The diplomat also highlighted that in the EU, each country makes its own decisions on the use of its weapons by Ukraine.Biden has been long adamant about not allowing Western-supplied weapons to be used on Russian soil, fearing an escalation. He first eased the restrictions in May to allow Ukraine to use certain weaponry like HIMARS to strike at Russian troops just across the border in the wake of the Kharkiv offensive. Unnamed U.S. officials, as well as a source familiar with the decision, who spoke to Reuters following the decision, said that Kyiv plans to conduct its first long-range strikes in the coming days. As the decision came in the last months of Biden&apos;s term in office, it remains unclear whether Trump will uphold the policy after he returns to the White House.	https://kyivindependent.com/borrell-confirms-us-authorization-for-ukraine-to-strike-deep-into-russia-with-missiles-up-to-300-km-in-range/	2024-11-18T11:41:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2154346451.jpg
Duda criticizes Scholz's call to Putin, saying 'it's a mistake'	Polish President Andrzej Duda called German Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos;s phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;a mistake&quot; in his post on X on Nov. 18. Scholz spoke with Putin on Nov. 15 for the first time in nearly two years. The German chancellor condemned Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, urged Putin to withdraw his troops, and discussed potential talks with Kyiv. President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Scholz&apos;s call with Putin opens a &quot;Pandora&apos;s box,&quot; potentially leading to &quot;other conversations and other calls.&quot; &quot;I doubt that the German Chancellor&apos;s conversation with Putin was agreed with the allies,&quot; Duda said. &quot;Russia is brutally attacking Ukraine, and one of the leaders of European countries, a strong economy, is holding talks with the aggressor. I think this is a mistake,&quot; Duda added. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia held talks in Minsk and Istanbul in March 2022, but the negotiations were eventually abandoned after Ukrainian retook the north of the country and mass war crimes were discovered in the liberated areas. In remarks during Ukraine&apos;s Peace Summit in June this year, Zelensky said the Istanbul talks failed because of the Russian side&apos;s &quot;ultimatums.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/duda-criticizes-scholzs-call-to-putin-saying-its-a-mistake/	2024-11-18T10:22:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1676988608.jpg
UN watchdog confirms riot control agent used on Ukraine battlefield	The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) confirmed on Nov. 18 that a riot control agent known as CS has been used in Ukraine, as evidence mounts that Russia has scaled up its attacks using chemical weapons in recent months. The United Nations watchdog OPCW&apos;s first confirmation about the tear gas usage comes as Russia has intensified its use of chemical agents since the beginning of the year to advance forward across Ukraine&apos;s front line. Russian drones throw gas grenades into dugouts or trenches in an attempt to force Ukrainian soldiers out into the open field, making them easy prey for drone or artillery attacks. The U.S. and the U.K. have confirmed Russia&apos;s deployment of chemical weapons against Ukrainian soldiers, slapping sanctions on Russia&apos;s troops of Radiological, Chemical and Biological Defense, their chief, Russian Defense Ministry scientific centers, and companies involved. The Ukrainian military has reported that it recorded over 4,600 cases of Russia using gas attacks on the battlefield since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in 2022, including 323 incidents in November. Without naming Russia nor directly confronting Moscow for violating the Chemical Weapons Convention, the OPCW said that samples from both the grenade and the soil sample retrieved from a September incident at a specific trench &quot;contained the riot control agent 2-Chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile, known as CS.&quot; While often used to disperse riots and considered nonlethal, the OPCW says that tear gas, including CS, is &quot;considered chemical weapons if used as a method of warfare.&quot; The samples &#x2014; which underwent separate testing in two OPCW-designated laboratories &#x2014; were collected from a trench &quot;located along the confrontation lines with the opposing troops&quot; in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, according to the report. The OPCW said in the Nov. 18 report that the watchdog&apos;s Director-General, Ambassador Fernando Arias, &quot;expressed grave concern over the findings.&quot; &quot;All 193 OPCW Member States, including the Russian Federation and Ukraine, have committed never to develop, produce, acquire, stockpile, transfer or use chemical weapons,&quot; Arias said. He stressed that the parties have declared that &quot;any use of chemical weapons is totally unacceptable and would violate the legal norms and standards of the international community.&quot; Earlier in May, OPCW said that Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of deploying chemical weapons, but &quot;the information provided to the Organization so far by both sides, together with the information available to the Secretariat, is insufficiently substantiated.&quot; While Russia&apos;s usage of chemical agents has slightly decreased since August, when 447 cases were recorded by the Ukrainian military within a month, Kyiv has been concerned about unidentified gas being deployed against its soldiers. Lacking &quot;hundreds&quot; of complex detectors that cost $100,000 to $600,000 to identify the chemicals used by Russian troops, the Ukrainian military has struggled to name the new or mixed types of gas to find a solution to how to protect its personnel, Ukrainian Colonel Artem Vlasiuk told the Kyiv Independent in October. Of the 323 recorded cases of Russia&apos;s chemical attacks in October, all except 15 incidents were &quot;unidentified,&quot; according to Vlasiuk from the Support Forces&apos; Radiation, Chemical, and Biological Protection Command, a branch of the army responsible for inspecting chemical warfare. The officer said that Ukraine struggled to identify the new types of gas because it lacked sophisticated high-end detector technology to diagnose beyond the few prototypes in its library &#x2014; which includes CS, CN, chloropicrin, and ammonia. It is often very difficult to send specialists to the front line for evidence collection, as it would mean risking their lives by having them walk kilometers to reach the positions. And when soldiers come under gas attacks, gathering the remains of the grenades used is usually not the priority. The concerns over the unidentified gas come as dozens of Ukrainian soldiers interviewed by the Kyiv Independent across the front over the summer acknowledged their lack of preparedness to face chemical warfare. Many said they were only given the poor quality Soviet-era gas masks and that they do not take it to positions because they are skeptical of its effectiveness. Often, comparing the danger of chemical agents to KAB guided-aerial bombs, artillery, and precise FPV drones, the infantrymen interviewed often downplayed the threat of gas &#x2014; arguing that they had more chance of being killed or wounded by conventional arms. At least three Ukrainian soldiers died from Russia&apos;s gas attacks, and almost 2,100 soldiers sought medical care after such incidents, according to the Support Forces. Many more could have gone unrecorded.	https://kyivindependent.com/un-watchdog-confirms-riot-control-agent-used-on-ukraine-battlefield/	2024-11-18T09:58:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1240855736.jpg
Unprecedented escalation' — Fico criticizes US for permitting use of ATACMS to strike Russia	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico criticized the U.S. decision to allow Ukraine to strike Russia with long-range ATACMS missiles in his Nov. 18 statement posted on Facebook. Several media outlets reported on Nov. 17 that U.S. President Joe Biden permitted Ukraine to use its ATACMS missiles to strike against targets on Russian soil. According to some reports, this so far concerns only Russian and North Korean forces amassing in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Fico claimed that Biden has authorized the use of ATACMS against targets in Russia &quot;to disrupt or delay peace talks completely.&quot; &quot;This is an unprecedented escalation of tension,&quot; Fico said, echoing the Kremlin&apos;s stance. The prime minister added that he had instructed Slovak Foreign Minister Juraj Blanar and Defense Minister Robert Kalinak not to support the U.S. decision &quot;in any international forum or in any way.&quot; &quot;Those who want to see the war in Ukraine continue are harming national and state interests,&quot; Fico said, adding that it is &quot;extremely important&quot; for Slovakia, as a neighbor of Ukraine, to achieve peace there. Fico is known for inflammatory statements on Ukraine and the war that often echo Moscow&apos;s talking points. He has repeatedly criticized military aid for Ukraine and called for restoring relations with Russia after the war. On Nov. 18, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the outgoing U.S. administration intends to &quot;provoke an escalation of the war&quot; in Ukraine. Several Russian lawmakers called the step an escalation that could &quot;lead to World War III&quot; and the end of Ukrainian statehood. Russia has repeatedly set supposed &quot;red lines&quot; on Western assistance for Ukraine, sometimes accompanied by veiled or overt nuclear threats. Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously said that long-range strikes against Russia with Western arms would mean NATO&apos;s involvement in the war, adding that Moscow is preparing &quot;various responses&quot; to such a step.	https://kyivindependent.com/unprecedented-escalation-fico-criticizes-us-for-permitting-use-of-atacms-to-strike-russia/	2024-11-18T09:33:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2152712934.jpg

Russia uses cheap decoy drones to overload Ukraine's air defense, Ukrainian intelligence says	Russian forces use cheap decoy drones with foreign components to overload Ukraine&apos;s air defense system, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Nov. 18. Russia has recently increased the number of large-scale drone attacks against Ukrainian cities, depleting Ukraine&apos;s air defense systems and targeting critical infrastructure. According to HUR, Russian manufacturers use components from the U.S., China, the Netherlands, and Switzerland to produce the Gerbera drone, a cheaper and less deadly equivalent of Iran&apos;s Shahed, at a plant in Yelabuga, in the Republic of Tatarstan, central Russia. The Gerbera drone can carry a combat payload similar to that of a kamikaze drone and conduct reconnaissance missions, particularly to detect air defense positions and record hits from other attack drones. The Gerbera is ten times cheaper than the Shahed or Geran drones due to the use of simple materials, such as plywood and foam. Yet, the drone contains a set of components from foreign manufacturers that &quot;are common for Russian weapons,&quot; according to HUR. Examination of the downed drones showed that Russia manufactures Gerberas based on a Chinese prototype using foreign components imported from China. The Gerbera drones were developed by the Chinese model aircraft manufacturer Skywalker Technology Co., Ltd., which also produces fuselages and organizes the supply of kits to Russia. The Gerbera&apos;s jamming-resistant antenna (CRPA) contains chips from Analog Devices and Texas Instruments, both made in the U.S., and NXP Semiconductors, made in the Netherlands. The flight controller also uses components manufactured by Texas Instruments, Atmel (USA), STMicroelectronics, U-Blox (Switzerland), NXP Semiconductors (Netherlands), and XLSEMI (China). The DLE60 engine is manufactured by the Chinese company Mile Hao Xiang Technology Co, Ltd. In the summer of 2024, the U.S. sanctioned this company for supplying Russia. Supplies are made through third-party companies, according to HUR. &quot;At this point, the biggest advantage that Russia may have in such attacks is sheer numbers of drones,&quot; Samuel Bendett, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security think tank, told the Kyiv Independent. Bendett mentioned the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in Russia&apos;s Republic of Tatarstan, where a Shahed-type drones plant is located. In May, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported, citing a contract leaked by the Prana Network hacker group, that the factory already produces 4,500 Shaheds and aims to increase this number to 6,000. &quot;It appears that Russian efforts in Alabuga have ensured that the Russian military has thousands such UAVs at its disposal along with other simpler, smaller variance identified recently that fly alongside these official Geran (Russian name for Shahed-type) UAVs,&quot; Bendett said. On Nov. 17, Russian forces launched one of the heaviest aerial strikes against the country throughout the full-scale war, primarily targeting the energy grid. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 102 of the 120 missiles and 42 of the 90 drones launched by Russia overnight.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-trying-to-overload-ukraines-air-defense-with-decoy-drones-made-of-plywood-foreign-parts-ukrainian-intelligence-says/	2024-11-18T09:17:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1489472156.jpg
Not waiting for Ukraine’s reconstruction, a U.S. entrepreneur is expanding his business in small-town Ukraine	When Chicagoan Chris Exline decided to expand his furniture rental company to Ukraine, he did not expect to relocate his life to a small town of 20,000 people in Ternopil Oblast. The businessman and CEO of Home Essentials initially planned to rent furniture to expats and organizations flooding in to help Ukraine&#x2019;s reconstruction and EU assimilation. The New Jersey-headquartered company had previously furnished the offices and residents of diplomats and embassies in war zones like Iraq and Afghanistan. When it became apparent that reconstruction was a long way off, Exline altered his business plan to go beyond his usual clients like USAID, a U.S. governmental aid agency. He opened a store in Kremenets in western Ukraine selling home goods from beds to scented candles with the option to pay in monthly installments through a layaway plan. While many investors are staying away from Ukraine until the end of the war, Exline has calculated a fruitful blueprint for smaller Ukrainian towns that have historically been ignored by foreign entrepreneurs. He has permanently relocated to Kremenets and has secured a stable client base of local homeowners while also donating mattresses to internally displaced people and soldiers on the front. &#x201C;Being based in Kremenets heightened my sensitivity and urgency to saving and creating jobs. That was a primary reason for locating here,&#x201D; he told the Kyiv Independent in an interview on the sidelines of the Kyiv Mayor&#x2019;s Summit on Nov. 8. Exline has since funneled hundreds of thousands of euros into his Ukrainian venture and will launch a factory producing upholstered furniture at the end of the year for the domestic and European markets. For now, the company has one shop in Kremenets and operations in Kyiv for corporate offices and diplomats. But Exline says there is an opportunity to expand rapidly in the next two years and bring the furniture rental business model to the mainstream, despite initial suspicion from locals. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Kyiv Independent. Why did you choose to open your business in Ukraine? &#xA0; Chris Exline: Like the entire world, I was shocked on Feb. 24, 2022. Then, four to six weeks later, I was shocked again that Ukraine was not going to capitulate. Simultaneously, there were estimates of reconstruction costs and EU integration talks. I realized we needed to get in early to be prepared (for reconstruction). We announced plans to enter the market and started receiving investment profiles from different oblasts in the summer of 2022. I got offers from all these towns with castles and 500-year-old monasteries. I thought, &#x201C;This is like a Disney movie!&#x201D; We knew that reconstruction would be happening in lots of different areas. A primary reason was also to get closer to a supply base. Bringing furniture in from China was a nonstarter because of shipping, cost of logistics, and timing. Home Essentials mattresses at the factory. (Home Essentials&apos;s private archive)We teamed up with a mattress factory in Kremenets, Ternopil Oblast, and were going to buy it but that fell through. I struck a deal with the owner to buy mattresses every month but we didn&apos;t really have an outlet to sell them in Kremenets, which is a town of 20,000 people, with 40% unemployment back in October 2022. The town also had 3,500 IDPs. I arrived on Oct. 3, 2022, and the next day I donated hundreds of mattresses to children who were sleeping on cardboard in a school and their families. &#xA0; We started the mattress donations and from that period I realized why I should be in Kremenets. The multiplier effect of what we did here would be much greater than if we were in Lviv, Ternopil, or Kyiv. &#xA0; By February 2023, it was obvious that the pace and scale of reconstruction weren&apos;t going to be as anticipated. &#xA0;I had to do something so I opened a Home Essentials store on May 1, 2023 &#x2014; the first home decor shop in Kremenets. I hope to open in Kopychyntsi (Ternopil Oblast) and Zolochiv (Lviv Oblast) before the end of the year. Afterward, we&apos;re going to open 25 stores within the next 25 months. Kyiv Independent: How do you find the locations? Chris Exline: Our staff did an exhaustive study and identified about a hundred towns. In those surveys, we look at the population, employment, the percentage of people on pensions, age, industries, and competitors. We identified towns all over Ukraine with similar demographics to Kremenets. Right now, it&apos;s our preference to do something more concentric and close to a fulfillment center. Once we have those stores, then we have sales and economies of scale to support our own manufacturing and then we&apos;re able to pass those savings on to the customers. Kyiv Independent: How does your business model work and could it become more commonplace in Ukraine? Chris Exline: It will be. We&apos;ve brought in an innovative new way of doing business. We have zero percent interest, we have no credit checks, it&apos;s a two-page agreement, and we don&apos;t use any banks. When I was figuring out how to change the business and align it with market expectations, I looked at a core component of Ukrainian culture, which is not to trust anyone at first. In Kremenets, the fact that I keep coming back again and again has built up trust. I tailored our business model. We don&#x2019;t accept cash until we deliver, we have stores so people can come in and see and touch, and we give them certain flexibility. We never turn their paper over to a bank. We don&apos;t ask troubling questions like proof of income, bank statements, or typical things that you would need to get a loan or finance. When people realize that we&apos;re not dependent on a bank and that we do this through our own cash flow, it shows them that we are a strong company. &#xA0; There was one customer who had a faulty mattress. She was shocked when we replaced it free of charge without an argument. She was expecting a confrontation.

(Alexey Furman/Getty Images)Kyiv Independent: How many people do you currently employ? Chris Exline: Currently 25. We will easily have 100-150 people when we have 25 stores. &#xA0; After we realized that the original premise for our market entry was not going to happen, a.k.a. really assisting in reconstruction, I stayed and continued to invest. I&apos;ve been here when we went four days without water and I had to use snow to clean plates. I chose to look at business setbacks and business reorientations and adapt. When hostilities cease, Ukrainians are going to know who was here and who is just coming in. When you&apos;re building a brand, people will remember. Had I stayed in Kyiv or Lviv, I wouldn&apos;t get a sense of what real Ukraine is going through. I think it&apos;s made me a better businessman. Our brand has very high goodwill with our customer base because we offer a very good service: We deliver on time, we charge less than other people, and we&apos;re plowing money back in through charitable efforts and helping those in need. That&apos;s why we&apos;re growing. Kyiv Independent: Do foreign investors need to reassess their understanding of business in Ukraine? Chris Exline: There are a lot of small companies in Europe that want to come in, but they don&apos;t have the financial resources. Denmark has a fund for Danish companies, and the same with the Netherlands and Poland. That business model is flawed. You have to make a business case to bureaucrats in Copenhagen, Amsterdam, and Warsaw, that you&apos;re going to come here and make money in doing so. But they&apos;re small companies, so they don&apos;t really have the resources. Large companies would never think of asking their government for seed capital or funding to come into Ukraine. They have the resources to do it but they are waiting until the end of the war. There&apos;s also a huge disconnect. Companies don&apos;t know how to come in because there&apos;s no clarity and no one to talk to. The Reconstruction Agency&#x2019;s director (Mustafa Nayyem) tried to attend the Recovery Conference in Berlin on this very subject. But he couldn&apos;t leave the country (to attend the conference) and then it took four months to find his replacement. What kind of message are you sending? You&apos;ve got all these people in Berlin, wanting to talk to the head of restoration, and he&apos;s not allowed to leave the country. The Home Essentials store in Kremenets, Ternopil Oblast.

(Home Essentials&apos;s private archive)The Kyiv Independent: How do you assess the business environment in Ukraine for foreign investors? Chris Exline: I think the opportunities for foreign investors are enormous and our (furniture rental) market is going to be very big. I would find it extremely hard to justify being here if the market was only in the tens of millions. I believe that our businesses in Ukraine could eclipse the businesses that we&apos;ve had combined over the past 25 years. If I see an opportunity in this small niche of furniture retail in towns of about 20,000 people in Ukraine, what are all the other opportunities that people can do? I&apos;m here because of the sacrifices of 2003, 2014, and obviously today. I know that Ukraine, no matter what happens, is never going back into a Russian system.	https://kyivindependent.com/not-waiting-for-ukraines-reconstruction-a-u-s-entrepreneur-is-expanding-his-business-in-small-town-ukraine/	2024-11-18T09:17:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1244363669.jpg
Nothing new under the sun' — German, French foreign ministers react on Ukrainian long-range strikes	German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot reacted on Nov. 18 to Washington easing restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s long-range strikes. Several media outlets reported on Nov. 17 that U.S. President Joe Biden permitted Ukraine to use its ATACMS missiles to strike against targets on Russian soil. According to some reports, this so far concerns only Russian and North Korean forces amassing in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Baerbock welcomed that U.S. President Joe Biden allowed Kyiv to use US long-range missiles against targets in Russia, the German news agency DPA reported, citing German broadcaster RBB Inforadio. &quot;Ukrainians shouldn&apos;t have to wait for rockets to cross the border &#x2014; &#xA0;they should be able to destroy launch sites directly,&quot; Baerbock said. Baerbock, who represents the Greens, said her party stands with its Eastern European partners, as well as the British, French, and American governments, in allowing Ukraine to strike deep into Russia. Barrot, during a meeting with journalists in Brussels, recalled that French President Emmanuel Macron had expressed his willingness to consider using French missiles to strike at Russian territory back in May. The French minister added that Paris remains &quot;open&quot; to allowing Ukraine to use French long-range missiles to hit military targets in Russia after the U.S. allowed Kyiv to use American missiles for the same purpose. &quot;We openly said that this was an option that we would consider if it was to allow to strike targets from where Russians are currently aggressing Ukrainian territory,&quot; Barrot told reporters in Brussels, Le Monde reported. &quot;Nothing new under the sun,&quot; Barrot added ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers. Ukraine has previously received U.S.-made ATACMS and Storm Shadow/SCALP missiles from the U.K. and France, with a range of 300 kilometers (190 miles) and 250 kilometers (150 miles), respectively. Yet, Paris and London have not permitted Kyiv to use their long-range weapons to strike deep into Russia amid Washington&apos;s doubts. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, in turn, is not planning to supply Ukraine with Taurus missiles despite the U.S. easing restrictions on long-range strikes. Berlin&apos;s policy may soon shift as Germany heads toward snap elections on Feb. 23, with the center-right opposition alliance CDU/CSU currently leading the polls and threatening to oust Scholz.	https://kyivindependent.com/nothing-new-under-the-sun-german-french-foreign-ministers-react-on-ukrainian-long-range-strikes/	2024-11-18T08:12:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/baerbock.jpeg
Turkey's peace plan for war in Ukraine 'unacceptable,' Russia says	The Kremlin on Nov. 18 dismissed a peace plan for Ukraine reportedly to be put forward by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, describing it as &quot;unacceptable.&quot; Erdogan&apos;s proposal would include Ukraine abstaining from joining NATO for at least 10 years, freezing the current front line, providing Ukraine with weapons, and deploying international troops to a demilitarized buffer zone in the country&apos;s east, Bloomberg reported. The news outlet also said Erdogan would propose the plan during G20 talks commencing on Nov. 18. Reacting to the reports, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed the proposal. &quot;The option of freezing the line of military conflict is unacceptable for the Russian side,&quot; he said in comments reported by Interfax. Erdogan&apos;s proposal comes as NATO countries prepare for a Donald Trump presidency, which many fear will lead to the U.S. pressuring Ukraine to end the war quickly, even at the cost of territorial concessions. The G20 countries are set to convene in Brazil without the participation of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Brazil is a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which issued an arrest warrant for Putin last year for the abduction of Ukrainian children. &#x200C; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will also not be present, despite numerous appeals to receive an invitation.&#x200C;&#x200C; Zelensky said on Nov. 16 that Ukraine must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means in 2025.&#x200C;&#x200C;	https://kyivindependent.com/turkeys-peace-plan-for-war-in-ukraine-unacceptable-russia-says/	2024-11-18T07:24:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1258775915.jpg
‘Battle-tested in Ukraine’ — How US drone makers turned Ukraine into a tagline to sell west	The biggest weapons makers in the world convened in Washington, D.C. for the 70th meeting of the Association of the United States Army in early October. It was the third year in a row where Ukraine remained at the center of the event&apos;s enormous buzz. Synchronized press releases ensued. Anduril, a heavy hitter among Silicon Valley&#x2019;s new generation of miltech unicorns, put out a flurry of announcements touting its generalized &#x201C;success in Ukraine&#x201D; as a pitch for new drone systems that were receiving lucrative contracts with the U.S. Defense Department. Western militaries are not shy about viewing Ukraine as a &#x201C;laboratory&#x201D; or &#x201C;testing ground&#x201D; for high-tech weapons. Given both the unprecedented use of drones in Ukraine and the novelty of the industry globally, U.S. manufacturers are keen to headline their work at the Ukrainian frontline. &#x201C;You cannot field an American drone system today that doesn&apos;t have the moniker of &#x2018;battle-tested in Ukraine&#x2019; on it. You can&#x2019;t. Which is why everybody&#x2019;s trying to do it,&#x201D; says James Acuna, a 20-year CIA operations officer and former naval architect, currently consulting on drones from Estonia. A combination of Silicon Valley PR machines and military secrecy makes total impact tough to gauge, but reports indicate that Western drones have not been particularly helpful to Ukraine, proving weak in the face of Russian electronic warfare. That has not stopped U.S. drone makers from constantly advertising product impact and C-suite man-hours logged in Ukraine as a pitch to better-heeled Western militaries, especially the U.S. &#x201C;Because you don&apos;t have success in Ukraine, you need to start embellishing, speaking half-truths. And it doesn&#x2019;t matter, because nobody can fact-check,&#x201D; Acuna says. Ukrainian soldier operates a drone during training of the 22nd Brigade in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, 3 May 2024. (Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu via Getty Images)The Ukrainian government has accepted foreign-funded weapons packages including Western drones, but has shown little interest in buying the weapons as they are exorbitantly expensive compared to domestically-produced drones. &#x201C;My problem with some of these drone companies is they&apos;ve been preaching about how much they&apos;ve been helping Ukraine for years or whatever, and what they did is they sold the U.S. government a bunch of stuff, made a bunch of money, and didn&apos;t support the end users,&#x201D; Bryan Sardoch told the Kyiv Independent from the AUSA conference. Sardoch is an American working for U.S-Ukrainian drone developer Bavovna.AI, which itself recently closed a $2.7 million seed round. U.S. weapons producers have treated inclusion in arms packages to Ukraine as a form of field testing since the war&#x2019;s outset. Performance in Ukraine &#x201C;validates&#x201D; production quality, as one Army officer put it. But while testing in Ukraine intuitively implies battlefield use, there are shortcuts. Remote fields across Ukraine have been designated as polyhony &#x2014; testing sites which Ukrainians use to try out their own drones. A cottage industry has cropped up resembling &#x201C;cruises&#x201D; for new Western drone companies looking to say they&#x2019;ve been tested in Ukraine, says Acuna. &#x201C;American companies will find &#x2014; and I&apos;ve butted heads with some of these people that offer this &#x2014; They&apos;ll say oh, three days, 3,800 euros, including assistance with customs and getting your drones into Ukraine, providing a unit that will evaluate your systems, a driver, hotels, mostly in Zhytomyr Oblast,&#x201D; says Acuna, referring wryly to a region some 70 miles west of Kyiv. &#x201C;It&apos;s a three-day package, 3,800 bucks, and inevitably, you get up-charged.&#x201D; Acuna says there is no comprehensive national certification for drone testing and a host of various letters of recommendation that units offer that are useless. He noted in particular claims that companies have passed &#x201C;rigorous specifications that the Defense Ministry has established for drone operations,&#x201D; or a similar standardized certifications. &#x201C;There&apos;s no gauntlet test that you do. Everything&apos;s informal, and everything is dependent on the unit or the brigade that you may talk to,&#x201D; says Acuna. Because of this systemic informality, it is impossible to say that a drone company has never been used at the front. Since the war&#x2019;s start, however, U.S. drone makers have fallen short, both in terms of the products delivered and their responsiveness to complaints from Ukrainian users. &#x201C;I got angry at how our stuff wasn&#x2019;t working,&#x201D; says Sardoch of the early days. He found himself in Ukraine at the start of Russia&#x2019;s invasion trying to link Ukrainian soldier complaints with American drone companies, &#x201C;fixing a lot of stupid stuff, honestly, with the American and U.K. drones that came over.&quot; &#x201C;There were a lot of issues with them both physically on the hardware or the software setup that were generally oversights.&#x201D; Ivan Kaunov, a drone pilot for the Ukrainian military turned developer of his own recon drones, recalls trying to hassle Western manufacturers about their equipment falling to Russian jammers two years ago only to be brushed off. &#x201C;They told me to tighten the antenna,&#x201D; he recalls one condescending response to navigation failing in the face of Russian electronic warfare. &#x201C;Western companies weren&#x2019;t listening about GPS. Now everybody knows that you can&#x2019;t use GPS (due to Russian EW).&#x201D; Those early issues have been the subject of prior reporting. Due to demand from the front that far surpassed foreign drone packages, Ukraine proceeded to build up its own drone industry massively. Digital Transformation Minister Mikhaylo Fedorov recently wrote that 96% of the million drones to reach the frontlines in 2024 have been Ukrainian-made. The remainder are predominantly Chinese, with limited Western drones on the ground.

Aerovironment saw 700 of its highly portable Switchblade 300s sent to Ukraine as part of a U.S. defense package early in the war. Aerovironment makes frequent mention of &#x201C;lessons learned from the conflict in Ukraine&#x201D; in announcements of sales to other countries. But the U.S. Army said it would no longer buy the Switchblade 300s a year after their first appearance in Ukraine, potentially due to limited success against Russian vehicles and their high cost. Aerovironment&#x2019;s newer 600s are better at taking out armor. Some have come to Ukraine but in quantities unknown. Russia has already downed and likely reverse-engineered them. The firm did not respond to multiple requests for clarification. At the start of October, Aerovironment said it plans to start production of Switchblade 600s in Ukraine. But like a number of foreign weapons producers ranging from the U.S. Northrop Grumman to the Turkish Bayraktar setting up factories in Ukraine, those facilities aren&#x2019;t necessarily going to be in production in time to provide weapons to Ukraine before President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January and a ceasefire deal is potentially negotiated. Major factories take time to set up in the best of circumstances, let alone when Russian missiles and drones crisscross Ukrainian skies nightly in search of targets to blow up. General Atomics, the maker of the $32 million Reaper drone, spent the duration of the 2023 counteroffensive trying to sell Ukraine two of those drones for a dollar in a marketing stunt that never resulted in those drones reaching Ukraine. The Wall Street Journal noted that it would cost $10 million to transport the two drones and another $8 million annually to maintain them. The Ukrainian government recently requested Shield AI&#x2019;s V-BAT drones &#x2014; in a request for the U.S. government to pay for 200 of the $1 million apiece units that the Californian drone startup advertised heavily. It is indicative of the general trend: Ukraine does not pay for US drones. They&#x2019;ll take them for free, but U.S. quality does not stack up to U.S. pricing relative to Ukrainian producers. &#x201C;Even with Skydio, like the X10, if you give it to me, it&apos;d be great, we&apos;re definitely gonna do good things with it, but at the cost, I&apos;d rather spend that money on several thousand of these smaller, cheaper, but still somewhat effective systems,&#x201D; says Sardoch. Founded in 2014, Skydio is likely the largest drone maker in the U.S. CEO Adam Bry appeared before Congress in June, mentioning Ukraine 65 times in his written remarks, making sure to introduce the country as &#x201C;where I recently visited.&#x201D; &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve shared our findings with colleagues in the Defense Department, and the U.S. military has begun to field new capabilities we developed with feedback from Ukraine and other customers, including resilient communications features,&#x201D; wrote Bry. &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1E6; We&#x2019;re deeply honored to have the &#x1D5D4;&#x1D5FF;&#x1D5FA;&#x1D5F2;&#x1D5F1; &#x1D5D9;&#x1D5FC;&#x1D5FF;&#x1D5F0;&#x1D5F2;&#x1D600; &#x1D5FC;&#x1D5F3; &#x1D5E8;&#x1D5F8;&#x1D5FF;&#x1D5EE;&#x1D5F6;&#x1D5FB;&#x1D5F2; senior officials tour Skydio HQ and our manufacturing facilities, and share their perspective with us on how drones are making a difference on the frontlines.From our experience serving incredible,&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/gUnfQoj3HM Bry continues to make appearances touting Ukraine as the future of defense &#x2014; as well as Skydio&#x2019;s eagerness to sell its drones to Ukraine. That is despite Skydio&#x2019;s drones proving &#x201C;not a very successful platform on the front lines,&#x201D; as Bry admitted to the Wall Street Journal in April, as part of an investigation into the overall failures of U.S. drones in Ukraine. In addition to heavy marketing from companies like Teledyne FLIR and Palantir, Acuna named two firms as the worst offenders of PR over substance in Ukraine: Skydio and Anduril. In the run-up to AUSA, Anduril announced a $250 million contract for 500 anti-drone &#x201C;RoadRunner&#x201D; drones to the U.S. Defense Department. Two days later, Anduril announced the Bolt, a loitering surveillance drone that the firm says can also carry a munition. The product is up for a $250 million contract with the Marine Corps. The firm puts its cost in the low tens of thousands of dollars per unit. &#x201C;Anduril, as a venture startup, is a wonderful company, except they give too much credit to their PR guys that are just saying how successful they are in Ukraine and hoping that nobody really fact-checks them,&#x201D; says Acuna. &#x201C;Ghost was an absolute failure &#x2014; one of their tactical drone systems in Ukraine, this abject failure. To their credit, they came back with this Ghost X, which is fine, but then when that started failing, they just steered into the nonsense curve, as opposed to trying to fix it,&#x201D; Acuna said of Anduril&#x2019;s Ukraine marketing strategy. In July, Anduril CEO Palmer Luckey told NPR that &#x201C;Anduril has had hardware in Ukraine since the second week of the war,&#x201D; for a story headlined &#x201C;This U.S. company is helping arm Ukraine against Russia.&#x201D; Of five Ukrainian drone pilots and builders that the Kyiv Independent spoke with, none had seen an Anduril product on the front with Russia. &#x201C;This is the first time I&#x2019;m hearing their name,&#x201D; says Serhiy from his post in Vovchansk when asked about Anduril. Serhiy has been in the Ukrainian military for five years and started piloting drones just before Russia&#x2019;s February 2022 full-scale invasion. &#x201C;If they&#x2019;re out here, it&#x2019;s a couple of artificial test flights.&#x201D; Soldiers of the Armed Forces inspect the FPV drones during the handover from the volunteer organization in Lviv, Ukraine on Sep. 13, 2024. (Stanislav Ivanov/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)&#x201C;What&#x2019;s flying today is almost all Ukrainian. Also, there are still a lot of Chinese drones,&#x201D; says Serhiy, who is identified by first name only as Ukrainian servicemen are not authorized to speak to the press. Anduril did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Anduril&#x2019;s long-time insistence that it is repatriating the best drones to the U.S. is an open question. Anduril&#x2019;s new Bolt, for example, looks exactly like various models from DJI &#x2014; the much cheaper Chinese drone maker whose commercial Mavics were the first drones to see widespread combat use in Ukraine. Charles Johnson, a former far-right influencer, sometimes conspiracy theorist and more recently an investor in aerospace and defense companies like Clearview AI and Umbra Space, disparaged Anduril&#x2019;s patriotism. &#x201C;Anduril has Chinese parts. In particular, they have a Chinese motor. They have failed in a lot of ways in Ukraine, but failure has been no deterrent for them and all the marketing around Ukraine,&#x201D; Johnson tells the Kyiv Independent. Johnson describes himself as &#x201C;the first non-blood relation to invest in Anduril after Palmer Luckey&#x2019;s mother, Julie Luckey,&#x201D; an investment he claims he made at the behest of the U.S. government. He says he sold his stake back to Luckey in early 2023 as a response to the company&#x2019;s work in Ukraine. &#x201C;The American Silicon Valley tech sector has more or less failed in Ukraine. And the DoD has more or less failed in Ukraine.&#x201D; Business Insider reported that Johnson recruited Peter Thiel &#x2014; whose Founder&#x2019;s Fund remains a major backer of Anduril &#x2014; to become an FBI informant. A civil lawsuit recently alleged that Johnson has used his former ties to intel as the basis for an extortion scheme. &#x201C;A lot of the contractor class has deliberately made a real mess of this Ukraine conflict,&#x201D; says Johnson, saying these contractors and the U.S. military benefit from a protracted war. William Hartung of the anti-war Quincy Institute warned two years ago of &#x201C;the larger push to exploit the war in Ukraine to jack up Pentagon spending for things that have nothing to do with defending Ukraine, or any likely future scenario.&#x201D; Despite limited use in Ukraine, Anduril has seen its valuation in private funding jump from $4.6 billion in June 2021 to $8.5 billion last December to $14 billion in August. Skydio&#x2019;s valuation more than doubled in private investments between March 2021 and February 2023. Unlike Anduril, Skydio and most other drone makers, Aerovironment is publicly traded. After a long slide throughout 2021, Aerovironment&#x2019;s stock dipped below $60 in February 2022. Today, it is over $215. Those valuations are the result of more than just marketing &#x2014; they are also riding the tide of rising geopolitical tensions. Upon its August fundraising round, Anduril wrote, &quot;The conflict in Ukraine has exposed a critical vulnerability in the United States&#x2019; ability to respond to crisis. In a major conflict, use of weapons and munitions would quickly exceed supply &#x2014; it is projected that the United States would run out of weapons in the first few weeks.&#x201D; The US federal lobbying of these companies is also telling. Per Senate disclosures, Skydio reported $100,000 in lobbying contracts per quarter at the end of 2021. That number grew to $170,000 by the present day, including the hiring of Joe Bartlett as director of federal policy. Bartlett previously served as national security advisor to Representative Elise Stepanik, now President elect Trump&#x2019;s pick as UN ambassador.

(Genya Savilov / AFP via Getty Images)Aerovironment&#x2019;s figures jumped from $40,000 a quarter to $230,000 the first quarter of 2024, though that figured has dropped to $130,000 since. Anduril, meanwhile, dropped $210,000 on lobbying in Q4 2021. In Q3 2024, that number was up to $490,000. The Lobbying Disclosure Act&#x2019;s definitions of what qualifies as lobbying are surprisingly limited, so these figures are a low limit for these companies&#x2019; spending on government interactions. &#x201C;I hate to say that intent is important to me, but it is,&#x201D; says Sardoch. &#x201C;If you&apos;re testing (in Ukraine) in order to provide better products to Ukraine to mess Russia up a little better, great. If you&apos;re going in there to do that so that you can sell it to the South Koreans, saying &#x2018;hey, this will help you defend your country, look, we went and tested it in Ukraine,&#x2019; using Ukraine as a tagline, or using Ukraine as an advertising tool, that&apos;s a problem.&#x201D; Acuna summarized U.S. drone makers&#x2019; intentions succinctly. &#x201C;They do not offer competitive cost-effective solutions and they ain&#x2019;t trying out for the Ukrainian team. They are looking to get DoD contracts.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/battle-tested-in-ukraine-how-us-drone-makers-turned-ukraine-into-a-tagline-to-sell-west/	2024-11-18T07:21:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2159781855.jpg
Opinion: What Trump’s past statements reveal about the future of US-Ukraine relations	Ukraine and the rest of Europe anxiously followed the U.S. presidential election results on Nov. 6, which ultimately reported Donald Trump and J.D. Vance as the winners, with the Republican Party also securing majorities in the House and Senate. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky quickly called the president-elect to offer congratulations and express interest in strengthening ties. But what does a Trump-Vance administration mean for Europe and Ukraine? Looking at past actions and campaign statements may provide insight. During his 2016-2020 term, Trump&#x2019;s stance toward NATO and Ukraine often raised eyebrows. He called NATO &#x201C;obsolete&#x201D; and argued that the U.S. should not be the world&#x2019;s police force. Trump withdrew American soldiers from Europe and opposed expanding the U.S. military presence there. He declined to fully endorse NATO&#x2019;s Article 5, which commits members to collective defense, and former aides reported that Trump even considered pulling out of the alliance. Trump&#x2019;s views on Ukraine also emerged during the 2016 election when he accused Ukraine of interfering in the U.S. election against him &#x2014; a claim later disproven by the FBI. Then, in 2019, he withheld defense assistance to Ukraine and requested that Zelensky investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his family. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) later ruled that withholding aid passed by Congress was illegal. The House of Representatives impeached Trump, though the Senate ultimately acquitted him. After losing the 2020 election, Trump vowed a political comeback and eventually secured the 2024 Republican nomination. During his campaign, Trump&#x2019;s positions on NATO and Ukraine remained unchanged &#x2014; and even hardened. At a recent rally, Trump reiterated that NATO members must meet the 2% defense spending threshold, stating he would not protect allies who fail to do so. &quot;You don&#x2019;t pay your bills, you get no protection,&quot; he said. Trump suggested he would let Russia &quot;do whatever the hell they want&quot; if a country falls short on payments. Many former officials from the Trump-Pence administration believe Trump is likely to withdraw from NATO, jeopardizing European security. A woman holds a sign saying &quot;Trump will end the Ukraine war&quot; at the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S. on July 17, 2024. (Patrick T. Fallon /AFP via Getty Images)Regarding Ukraine, Trump pledged to end the war in one day by forcing Ukrainian officials to negotiate with Russia and cede territory. He has argued that U.S. aid to Ukraine is excessive and has called for cuts. Now, with the election behind him, Trump is expected to push for a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine that would likely reduce U.S. support. Trump has also said he would seek to delay Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership bid. Vance shares Trump&#x2019;s critical views on NATO and Ukraine. He has argued that European countries should handle their own security issues without U.S. involvement. Vance, who has opposed every bill supporting Ukraine since Russia&#x2019;s invasion, has said he &#x201C;doesn&#x2019;t really care&#x201D; about Ukraine and that the U.S. should stop its aid. He also opposes Ukraine&#x2019;s potential NATO membership, arguing it should remain neutral. With Republicans in control of Congress, Trump and Vance will find support for their isolationist policies. House Speaker Mike Johnson, for example, has called on Europe to take more responsibility for its own security and suggested that NATO allies increase their defense spending. Johnson also backs Trump&#x2019;s forced peace plan for Ukraine, stating he does &#x201C;not have an appetite for further Ukraine funding&#x201D; and expressing confidence that Trump can end the war by pushing for negotiations with Russia. While most Senate Republicans support NATO and aid to Ukraine, their stance could clash with Trump, Vance, and Johnson&#x2019;s agenda. These differences could lead to friction between the White House, House, and Senate. The Trump-Vance administration is poised to reduce U.S. involvement in NATO and foreign conflicts. Trump, Vance, and Johnson argue that the U.S. has done enough for Ukraine and Europe. They intend to work with Russia on a peace agreement that may require Ukraine to adopt neutrality and forego NATO membership. In other words, Europe and Ukraine may soon find themselves without U.S. support. Facing Russian aggression alone, European nations and Ukraine will have to strengthen their cooperation and resilience amid an increasingly uncertain future. Only time will reveal whether they will succeed.

Ukraine's GDP grows by 4.2% in 10 months of 2024	Ukraine&#x2019;s economy grew by 4.2% year-on-year in the first 10 months of 2024 thanks to the construction, transportation, and manufacturing sectors, the country&apos;s Economy Ministry said on Nov. 18. The 4.2% growth aligns with earlier government forecasts. Russia&apos;s invasion caused a major hit to Ukraine&apos;s economy, which suffered a whopping 29.1% fall in GDP in 2022. Recovery programs aimed at rebuilding damaged and destroyed housing boosted the construction industry, fueling the growth. The transportation and manufacturing sectors were also among the drivers, mainly thanks to the restored Black Sea trade corridor and increased defense production, respectively, First Deputy Economy Minister Oleksii Sobolev said in a statement. Ukraine&apos;s GDP grew by 1.3% between October 2023 and the same month this year. According to the ministry, this figure was negatively affected by a lower-than-usual output of agriculture this time of the year due to an early harvest. &quot;By October, farmers had already finished harvesting some crops,&quot; the ministry said. The economy stabilized faster than expected in 2023 due to several successful government programs, as well as international support, and grew by 5.3% in 2023. In July 2024, the Economy Ministry reported a 4.1% growth over the past six months compared to the first six months of 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-gdp-grows-by-4/	2024-11-18T06:49:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/Dream-4.jpg
Opinion: With Trump back, Europe can’t afford to guess on sanctions against Russia	The implications of Donald Trump&#x2019;s imminent return to the White House on Russia&#x2019;s illegal war in Ukraine are being minutely dissected. Will he deliver on his boast that he can end the war within 24 hours? How will he do that &#x2014; if he can? At what cost to the long-suffering citizens of Ukraine? And how should Ukraine&#x2019;s European allies anticipate and respond to whatever the new president &#x2014; with all his unpredictability &#x2014; chooses to do? One area that will inevitably draw attention in any future Trump strategy on Ukraine is the continued imposition and enforcement of sanctions on Russia&#x2019;s ability to fund and resource its full-scale invasion. What might we expect, and how should Ukraine and its European allies prepare? The first important point to note is that Trump is no stranger to sanctions and other coercive economic tools of statecraft. During his first presidency, he used sanctions aggressively against Iran, pulling the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action), which provided some nuclear-related sanctions relief for Iran, and doubled down on sanctions in his &#x201C;maximum pressure&#x201D; campaign against Tehran. Other countries, such as Venezuela and North Korea, also saw an uptick in U.S. sanctions. Of course, Trump&#x2019;s addiction to tariffs was also on display. Second, Trump&#x2019;s love of deals, his desire to win and not appear weak, and his obsession with &#x201C;value for money&#x201D; for the American people are likely to play an important role in his future use of sanctions on Russia. Based on these criteria, it is not certain that, even if he could roll back sanctions on Russia, he necessarily would. For the U.S., sanctions on Russia are an almost costless tool given the limited connection between the U.S. and Russian economies; imposing sanctions allows Trump to look tough and support his drive for whatever deal he wants to secure with the Kremlin. Third, the U.S. legislative landscape may hamper his ability to lift sanctions unilaterally. For example, the 2017 Countering America&#x2019;s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) places certain restrictions on the president&#x2019;s ability to lift sanctions on Russia &#x2014; something Trump acknowledged during his previous term in the White House, noting that signing CAATSA into law would restrict his ability &#x201C;to strike good deals&#x201D; for the American people. But whatever transpires, European nations must assume that the transatlantic coordination and collaboration that has worked so well on the design, implementation, and enforcement of sanctions on Russia since February 2022 may not continue. So, what should Brussels and London do? European Commissioner President Ursula von der Leyen holds a press conference during a European Union summit in Brussels, Belgium, on March 23, 2023. (John Thys / AFP via Getty Images)The first point to acknowledge is that across Europe, the commitment to sanctions against Russia remains strong, despite nearly three years of effort. The lessons from 2014 have been learned. As European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen noted in an address to the Verkhovna Rada in November 2023, &#x201C;we shall not repeat the mistakes of 2014. And we will continue to apply maximum pressure against Russia, until the end of the aggression, until Ukraine has re-established a just peace.&#x201D; As von der Leyen begins a new term as Commission president, with key sanctions staff such as EU Sanctions Envoy David O&#x2019;Sullivan still in place, and with Poland taking on the presidency of the Council of the EU from January 2025, there is no doubt that the EU&#x2019;s commitment to sanctions will remain visible and strong. The same is true of the new government in London, where Sir Keir Starmer and his foreign secretary see cross-channel collaboration on sanctions as a key opportunity for rapprochement with Brussels. But rhetoric will not, by itself, suffice. Despite the scale of sanctions imposed on Russia, spiraling inflation, and an overheating economy, the Kremlin continues to secure the funding and resources it needs. With this in mind, and particularly if the U.S. becomes an unreliable partner, Europe needs to learn from Washington and adopt a far more muscular approach to its application of sanctions, leveraging its extensive trade relations with third countries and the use of the euro and pound sterling. This will require Europe to accelerate its domestic enforcement efforts and ensure the sanctions criminalization directive is swiftly enacted and enforced. It will also require diplomatic dialogue with third countries facilitating circumvention, balanced with jeopardy for those countries &#x2014; and, importantly, their private sector actors &#x2014; that choose to continue to fund and resource Russia&#x2019;s military. Finally, it calls for a more proactive, intelligence-led mindset among those charged with ensuring sanctions effectiveness. Europe has had three years to get match-fit on sanctions, and while the application of sanctions may be a marathon, not a sprint, changes in the White House mean that Europe can no longer jog behind Uncle Sam. It&#x2019;s time for Europe to shed its timidity and show what it has learned. Anything less will be a betrayal of the Ukrainian people at a time when they need Europe more than ever.

Zelensky visits key front-line town of Pokrovsk	President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, currently lying some 6-7 kilometers from the front line, his Telegram channel reported on Nov. 18. Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub for Ukrainian forces in the east, has come into artillery and drone range of Russian forces moving relentlessly forward in Donetsk Oblast. With Moscow&apos;s troops drawing near, losing the town would be a serious blow to other parts of the front line&apos;s defense as well. &quot;A tense sector. It is only thanks to the strength of the soldiers that the east (of Ukraine) is not completely occupied by Russia. The enemy receives a response every day,&quot; &#xA0;Zelensky said. 0:00/1&#xD7;President Volodymyr Zelensky visits Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on Nov. 18, 2024. (Presidential Office)The head of state also visited the base of the 25th Airborne Brigade and handed out awards to soldiers. During his trip, Zelensky was accompanied by Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin, who called Pokrovsk &quot;one of the hottest spots&quot; of the front line. Zelensky has previously visited the most critical sectors of the front line during the full-scale war, including now Russian-occupied Bakhmut or Avdiivka. His visit aims to boost the morale among Ukrainian troops, who are increasingly on the back foot in the face of a Russian advance. The inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in January adds further uncertainty regarding the future of Ukrainian defense capabilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-visits-pokrovsk/	2024-11-18T06:19:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Zelensky-Pokrovsk.jpeg
Scholz's stance on Taurus unchanged despite US permission on long-range strikes	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is not planning to supply Ukraine with Taurus missiles despite the U.S. easing restrictions on long-range strikes, a government spokesperson told the AFP news agency on Nov. 18. Scholz has &quot;made his position clear&quot; on the matter and will &quot;not change his stance anymore,&quot; spokesperson Wolfgang Buchner said. Several media outlets reported on Nov. 17 that U.S. President Joe Biden permitted Ukraine to use long-range U.S. arms against targets on Russian soil. According to some reports, this concerns ATACMS missiles to be deployed against Russian and North Korean forces amassing in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Ukraine has previously received U.S.-made ATACMS and Storm Shadow/SCALP missiles from the U.K. and France, with a range of 300 kilometers (190 miles) and 250 kilometers (150 miles), respectively. In contrast, Scholz has been adamant about not supplying the Taurus cruise missiles, which boast a range of 500 kilometers (310 miles), fearing an escalation with Russia. Berlin&apos;s policy may soon shift as Germany heads toward snap elections on Feb. 23, with the center-right opposition alliance CDU/CSU currently leading the polls and threatening to oust Scholz. CDU/CSU&apos;s chancellor candidate, Friedrich Merz, said he would allow the delivery of Taurus missiles, but only if necessary after issuing an ultimatum to Russian President Vladimir Putin and lifting restrictions on arms that had already been provided. Similarly, Vice Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habeck, who is running for the Chancellery for the Greens, said he would greenlight the delivery of the missiles if elected in February.	https://kyivindependent.com/scholz-taurus-long-range-strikes/	2024-11-18T05:10:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175014888.jpg
Zelensky to present resilience plan to Ukrainian MPs 'in coming days,' media reports	President Volodymyr Zelensky will present his &quot;internal resilience plan&quot; to lawmakers as early as Nov. 19, Ukrainska Pravda reported on Nov. 18, citing sources from the ruling Servant of the People party. The 10-point plan will address the front-line situation, the military-industrial complex, the economy and finance, regional development, and other strategic sectors. The outlet wrote that Zelensky will present the plan &quot;in the coming days,&quot; with his speech preliminarily planned for Nov. 19. The government&apos;s latest plan will focus on internal solutions and is not an alternative to the five-point victory plan oriented toward Kyiv&apos;s international partners. &quot;There are 10 points in total, which will be presented next week, and for each point, together with Ukrainian civil society, together with everyone who is ready to add rational ideas, with business, we will prepare a basic, doctrinal document for Ukraine, for our sustainability,&quot; Zelensky said on Nov. 14. Facing Russian military advances and increasingly uncertain Western support, Zelensky previously pitched to Ukraine and its allies a five-step victory plan containing steps that should supposedly end the war by 2025. Some points of the plan met with a lukewarm response from partners, with several countries resisting key steps like a NATO invitation for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-present-resilience-plan-to-ukrainian-mps/	2024-11-18T04:34:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Zelensky.jpeg
Biden administration aims to 'provoke further escalation' — Kremlin comments on long-range strikes	The outgoing U.S. administration intends to provoke an escalation of the war in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the media on Nov. 18 following reports that Washington eased restrictions on long-range strikes. Several media outlets reported on Nov. 17 that U.S. President Joe Biden permitted Ukraine to use its ATACMS missiles to strike against targets on Russian soil. According to some reports, this so far concerns only Russian and North Korean forces amassing in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. &quot;You know, with the reports in Western media, it is obvious that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps... to add fuel to the fire and continue to provoke further escalation of tensions,&quot; Peskov said, according to the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. The statement comes as Biden is set to leave office in January, with Donald Trump replacing him in the Oval Office. The Biden administration has pledged to deliver as much support to Ukraine as possible before Trump takes office. Several Russian lawmakers called the step an escalation that could &quot;lead to World War III&quot; and the end of Ukrainian statehood. Russia has repeatedly set supposed &quot;red lines&quot; on Western assistance for Ukraine, sometimes accompanied by veiled or overt nuclear threats. Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously said that long-range strikes against Russia with Western arms would mean NATO&apos;s involvement in the war, adding that Moscow is preparing &quot;various responses&quot; to such a step. Biden has been long adamant about not allowing Western-supplied weapons to be used on Russian soil, fearing an escalation. He first eased the restrictions in May to allow Ukraine to use certain weaponry like HIMARS to strike at Russian troops just across the border in the wake of the Kharkiv offensive. Unnamed U.S. officials, as well as a source familiar with the decision, who spoke to Reuters following the decision, said that Kyiv plans to conduct its first long-range strikes in the coming days. As the decision came in the last months of Biden&apos;s term in office, it remains unclear whether Trump will uphold the policy after he returns to the White House.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-long-range-strikes/	2024-11-18T03:59:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245735181.jpeg
Germany to provide Ukraine with 4,000 AI-powered 'Mini-Taurus' drones, Bild reports	Ukraine is set to receive new German-developed AI-powered kamikaze drones in the coming weeks, the German tabloid Bild reported on Nov. 18. The German government is reportedly funding a contract concluded in September between the Munich-based tech defense firm Helsing and Ukraine for the supply of 4,000 attack drones. Drones are an increasingly vital capability on Ukrainian battlefields. Russia has widely used kamikaze drones like Iranian Shaheds to target Ukrainian cities and infrastructure or domestically-made Lancets against Kyiv&apos;s troops. The previously top-secret high-tech drones have been nicknamed &quot;Mini-Taurus&quot; in reference to Germany&apos;s powerful cruise missiles, which Berlin refused to supply to Ukraine. According to Bild&apos;s source, the drone can &quot;orient&quot; itself in the terrain and is resistant to GPS jamming. After the operator orders a strike on a target, the aerial vehicle can fly to it independently, even when the radio connection is lost. #ScoopGermany delivers 4.000 &#x201C;#MiniTaurus&#x201D; strike drones to Ukraine.Comparable to the American SwitchBlade and the Russian Lancet, the &#x201C;Helsing&#x201D; product is cheaper, can fly longer and uses terrain matching AI for its entire cruise and terminal guidance.All exclusive details&#x2935;&#xFE0F; https://t.co/1kFDzkSTQt The drone boasts four times the range of kamikaze drones used by the Ukrainian military and carries warheads powerful enough to destroy Russian tanks, the outlet writes. It is also said to be comparably cheaper than foreign equivalents, like U.S.-made Switchblades or Russian Lancets. The weapons are reportedly being tested and improved &quot;under real operational conditions&quot; in eastern Ukraine. Full-scale deliveries are expected in December, with hundreds to be delivered per month. The supply of the new drones was confirmed for the outlet by German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. In the wake of the latest Russian mass attack against Ukraine on Nov. 17, the minister told Bild he was &quot;very happy that the delivery of these AI-powered strike drones is starting right now.&quot; Helsing signed a memorandum with Ukraine on cooperation in the field of defense technology in February 2024. The company has been active in Ukraine since 2022. In October, France announced that it would deliver newly developed Colibri project kamikaze drones to Kyiv, further boosting Ukraine&apos;s drone capabilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/mini-taurus-bild/	2024-11-18T03:26:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2158978909.jpg
Turkish president to propose freezing Ukraine front line, Bloomberg reports	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will propose his peace plan for Ukraine during the G20 talks commencing on Nov. 18, Bloomberg reported, citing undisclosed sources. Erdogan&apos;s proposal would include Ukraine foregoing joining NATO for at least 10 years, freezing the current front line, providing Ukraine with weapons, and deploying international troops to a demilitarized buffer zone in the Donbas, Bloomberg reported. The Turkish leader&apos;s proposal comes as NATO countries prepare for a Donald Trump presidency, which many fear will lead to the U.S. pressuring Ukraine to end the war quickly, even at the cost of territorial concessions. The G20 countries are set to convene in Brazil without the participation of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Brazil is a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which issued an arrest warrant for Putin last year for the abduction of Ukrainian children. &#x200C;&#x200C; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will also not be present, despite numerous appeals to receive an invitation.&#x200C;&#x200C; Zelensky said on Nov. 16 that Ukraine must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means in 2025.&#x200C;&#x200C; Zelensky&apos;s words followed German Chancellor Olaf Scholz&#x2019;s phone conversation with Putin, during which he condemned Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine and called to withdraw Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. He also urged Russia to negotiate with Ukraine to achieve a &quot;just and lasting peace.&quot; The call sparked anger in Ukraine, with Zelensky saying it could open a &quot;Pandora&apos;s Box&quot; for further engagement with the Russian leader. In the wake of Trump&apos;s election, Kyiv has urged its partners to adopt a &quot;peace through strength&quot; approach to pressure Russia toward a just peace.	https://kyivindependent.com/erdogan-peace-plan/	2024-11-18T03:02:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1410425074.jpg
Russia launches missile attack on Odesa, casualties reported	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russian forces launched a missile attack against the port city of Odesa on Nov. 18, killing and injuring people, Governor Oleh Kiper reported. Residential buildings were damaged in the attack, the governor said. The number of casualties and the full extent of damage are being determined. The attack occurred shortly after Russia launched one of its largest mass strikes against Ukraine on Nov. 17 and deadly missile attacks against the city of Sumy overnight on Nov. 18.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-missile-attack/	2024-11-18T02:41:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1587644884.jpg
German Greens chancellor candidate says he would send Taurus to Ukraine if elected	The German Greens&apos; candidate for chancellor, incumbent Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, told the ARD television channel on Nov. 17 that if elected, he would greenlight the delivery of Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine. &quot;The answer to this question is: yes!&quot; said Habeck in response to a question about whether he would authorize the missiles&apos; delivery. The vice chancellor has served as the economy minister in a coalition government with Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos;s Social Democrats and, until recently, the FDP liberals. Germany is heading toward snap elections on Feb. 23, 2025, after Scholz fired FDP&apos;s Finance Minister Christian Lindner, leading to the coalition&apos;s collapse. German assistance to Ukraine, which has become a topic of the electoral campaign, is increasingly crucial amid fears that the U.S. might withdraw its support after Donald Trump&apos;s recent election victory. Berlin is Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor under Scholz, but the chancellor has been adamant about not providing Taurus missiles, fearing it could draw his country into the war. Habeck said in the interview that deciding on arms deliveries has been part of his job as the economy minister, adding that those &quot;were some of the most difficult decisions (he) had to make.&quot; The German-Swedish air-launched Taurus missiles have a range of up to 500 kilometers (310 miles), which is more than the ATACMS or Storm Shadow/SCALP missiles provided to Ukraine by the U.S., the U.K., and France. Friedrich Merz, the chancellor candidate of the opposition center-right CDU/CSU alliance, also said he would allow the delivery of Taurus missiles but only after issuing an ultimatum to Russian President Vladimir Putin and lifting restrictions on already provided arms. CDU/CSU is currently leading the polls with 33%, followed by the Russian-friendly, far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) with 18%, the Social Democrats at 16%, and the Greens with 11%.	https://kyivindependent.com/habeck-taurus/	2024-11-18T01:52:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185227954--1-.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 18, injure more than 100 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least 18 civilians and injured at least 108 over the past day, including children, regional authorities reported on Nov. 18. Ukrainian forces shot down eight of the 11 drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force said. Russian forces also reportedly attacked Sumy Oblast with two Iskander-M ballistic missiles and a Kh-59 aerial guided missile. Russia launched multiple missile attacks on the city of Sumy overnight, targeting residential areas. Eleven people were killed, including two children, the regional military administration reported. Eighty-four people were injured in Russian overnight attacks against the city, including 11 children, authorities said. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, two people were killed, and six people were injured during the day on Nov. 17, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. Attacks against the Nikopol district with drones and artillery killed a 58-year-old man and a 62-year-old woman. Three women aged 67, 72, and 57, and two men aged 40 and 32 were injured. A high-rise building, a transport company building, a medical facility, and other buildings and civilian infrastructure sites were damaged. A 45-year-old man was also injured and hospitalized with shrapnel wounds following a Russian attack against the Synelnykove district, Lysak said. Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast injured one person in the town of Siversk, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Three people were injured during Russian attacks against Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. An 84-year-old man was injured in the village of Hlushkivka, and two women aged 50 and 65 were injured in the town of Kupiansk. Four people were killed, and 10 were injured in Russian attacks overnight and on Nov. 17 in Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. One more person &#x2013; a 46-year-old man &#x2013; was killed during an attack in the morning of Nov. 18, according to the governor. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, three women aged 52, 55, and 61, as well as a 59-year-old man, were injured during attacks against the Polohy district, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. Luhansk, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, and Kyiv oblasts also came under attack, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-105/	2024-11-18T00:49:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Sumy-Nov-18.jpg
Step toward World War III,' Russian MPs say after long-ranke strike permission reports	Senior Russian lawmakers threatened on Nov. 17 that outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s decision to allow Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory with ATACMS missiles could lead to World War III and the loss of Ukrainian statehood. &quot;This is a very big step towards the start of World War III,&quot; lawmaker Vladimir Dzhabarov said, according to Russia&#x2019;s state-owned TASS state news agency. Biden has authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles for strikes inside Russia, marking a significant shift in U.S. policy, several media outlets reported on Nov. 17. Ukraine will likely initially use the missiles against Russian and North Korean forces in Kursk Oblast, but Washington could also authorize their use elsewhere, undisclosed official sources told the New York Times. The decision has not been publicly confirmed by Kyiv or Washington, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying that the &quot;missiles will speak for themselves.&quot; &quot;The West has decided on a level of escalation that could end with the remnants of Ukraine completely losing their statehood,&quot; Andrei Klishas, a member of Russia&#x2019;s Federation Council, wrote on his Telegram channel. The Kremlin has yet to comment officially on the latest reports. Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously said that long-range strikes against Russia with Western arms would mean NATO&apos;s involvement in the war, adding that Moscow is preparing &quot;various responses&quot; to such a step. Russia has repeatedly set supposed &quot;red lines&quot; on Western assistance for Ukraine, sometimes accompanied by veiled or overt nuclear threats. The policy change follows Biden&apos;s previous hesitance to provide such weapons out of concern for escalating tensions with Russia. While U.S. officials do not expect this move to &quot;change the overall course of the war,&quot; Biden reportedly aims to help Ukraine target critical Russian and North Korean military assets and send a deterrent message to Pyongyang, the New York Times wrote. Proponents of the decision have long argued that this authorization would significantly enhance Ukraine&#x2019;s defense capabilities, especially with Russia ramping up military offensives on many fronts and intensifying drone and missile attacks in recent months.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-mps-long-range/	2024-11-18T00:01:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2030058312.jpg
Russian drones, missiles violate Moldova's airspace during strike on Ukraine, Chisinau says	Russia&#x2019;s large-scale missile and drone attack on Ukraine overnight on Nov. 17 also violated Moldovan airspace, Moldova&apos;s foreign minister said on X on Nov. 17. Russia&#x2019;s latest large-scale aerial attack left at least seven civilians dead and around 20 injured across multiple regions, targeting power generation and transmission facilities throughout Ukraine, authorities said. &quot;We strongly condemn the violation of Moldova&#x2019;s airspace by Russia&#x2019;s missiles and drones targeting Ukraine&#x2019;s critical infrastructure today,&quot; Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mihai Popsoi said.

In a video attached to his post, a house is seen with an increasingly loud sound of a jet engine, claimed to be a Russian projectile. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. Popsoi&#x2019;s reaction was the latest in a long row of diplomatic spat between Moldova and Russia, with the former handing a note of protest to the newly appointed Russian ambassador on Nov. 12. over Russian interference in the recent presidential election and the crashing of two Russian drones on Moldovan territory earlier.

Missiles will speak for themselves' — Zelensky reacts to long-range strike permission reports	President Volodymyr Zelensky commented on Nov. 17 on recent reports that the U.S. eased restrictions on long-range strikes within Russia, saying that &quot;such things are not announced.&quot; The president made the statement shortly after the New York Times reported that the Biden administration had permitted the use of U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles across the border, namely against Russian and North Korean forces amassing in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. The report has not been publicly confirmed by Washington or Kyiv. &quot;Today, there&#x2019;s a lot of talk in the media about us receiving permission for respective actions,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address. &quot;But strikes are not carried out with words. Such things are not announced. Missiles will speak for themselves.&quot; The decision would come as a major shift in U.S. policy as President Joe Biden has been long adamant about not allowing Western-supplied weapons to be used on Russian soil, fearing an escalation. Biden first eased the restrictions in May to allow Ukraine to use certain weaponry like HIMARS to strike at Russian troops just across the border in the wake of the Kharkiv offensive.

Nordic countries equipping citizens with pamphlets offering advice in case of war	The governments of Norway, Sweden, and Finland have begun the distribution of informative pamphlets to citizens, providing them with advice in case of the outbreak of war or other emergency situations, BBC reported on Nov. 17. Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine exacerbated fears among neighboring countries of a potential open conflict between Moscow and NATO. Citizens of Sweden will begin to receive pamphlets in the mail on Nov. 18, providing basic information on a &quot;worsening security situation&quot; amid Russia&apos;s ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In recent months, both Finland and Norway also provided pamphlets to its citizens. Helsinki provided a virtual pamphlet, as opposed to a physical copy, in an effort to save taxpayer money, while Oslo distributed 2.2 million paper pamphlets, &quot;one for each household in Norway,&#x201D; according to a spokesperson for Norwegian Directorate for Civil Protection, the BBC reported. The advice provided in the pamphlets &#x2014; which have been reprinted and updated from earlier versions &#x2014; provides basic survival information, including information on meals and medicines, while stressing that the Nordic countries are prepared for &quot;self-defense&quot; in case of a war. &#x201C;If Sweden is attacked by another country, we will never give up. All information to the effect that resistance is to cease is false,&#x201D; Stockholm&apos;s advice reads. Both Sweden and Finland joined the NATO alliance in the two years following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Both countries abandoned their non-alignment policy, concerned that they may become a target of Russia&apos;s expansionist ambitions. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova previously threatened Sweden in February 2024 saying there would be a Russian response to the country&apos;s then-prospects of joining NATO, but did not clarify what it would entail. Russian President Vladimir Putin also made similar vague threats to Finland after it joined the alliance, saying in December 2023 that Finland is &quot;now going to have problems&quot; because it joined NATO. NATO militaries have strengthened their capacity and preparedness since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While the prospect of the war escalating to an all-out clash between the alliance and Russia has so far been averted, there are concerns that the West has not truly accepted that it may still be a possibility. In Lithuania, the LRT public broadcaster reported on July 25, citing the country&apos;s Interior Ministry, that the country&apos;s authorities are drawing up plans for mass evacuations of civilians in case of an armed conflict. Several NATO commanders and other alliance leaders have warned in increasingly stark terms in recent months about the dangers of such a war and what impact it could have across Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/nordic-countries-equipping-citizens-with-information-advice-in-case-of-war/	2024-11-17T21:28:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1839741170.jpg
Multiple drones shot down on outskirts of Moscow, mayor claims	Russian air defense intercepted multiple drones on the outskirts of Moscow, the city&apos;s mayor, Sergey Sobyanin, said overnight on Nov. 18. At least one drone was shot down over the Ramensky district of the city, while another was downed over the Pavlovsky Posad district around 4:30 a.m. local time, Sobyanin claimed. The Kyiv Independent could not verify Sobyanin&apos;s claims, and Ukraine&apos;s military has not yet commented on the attack. The alleged attack on the Russian capital comes one night after Russia launched a large-scale missile and drone attack on different cities across Ukraine, leaving seven civilians dead and at least 19 injured. In recent months, Russia has continued to increase its use of attack drones, targeting cities and towns across Ukraine on a near daily basis since the start of September. The Ukrainian Air Force previously said that Russia launched at least 4,300 Shahed-type attack drones and similar UAVs imitating Shaheds against Ukraine between August and October 2024. Ukraine has previously hit targets within Russia, aiming primarily at the country&apos;s oil infrastructure and defense industry. On Nov. 10, Russian air defense shot down 70 Ukrainian drones, including 34 in Moscow Oblast, in Ukraine&#x2019;s largest drone attack on the Russian capital. At least one person was reported injured in Moscow Oblast in that attack. The day before the largest attack on Moscow, Russia launched its own largest overnight drone attack on Ukraine on Nov. 9-10, with 145 drones entering Ukrainian airspace.	https://kyivindependent.com/multiple-drones-shot-down-on-outskirts-of-moscow-mayor-claims/	2024-11-17T19:41:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1259010576.jpg
Trump Jr. ridicules US decision to authorize Ukraine to target Russia with long-range missiles	President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s son, Donald Trump Jr., ridiculed U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s decision to authorize Kyiv&apos;s use of U.S.-supplied long-range missiles for strikes inside Russia. According to media reports, Biden authorized the decision on Nov. 17, marking a significant shift in U.S. policy. Unnamed U.S. officials, as well as a source familiar with the decision, who spoke to Reuters following the decision said that Kyiv plans to conduct its first long-range strikes in the coming days. While reposting a news item of the policy change on X, Trump Jr. referred to the Biden administration as &quot;imbeciles&quot; for allowing the decision to go forward. The Military Industrial Complex seems to want to make sure they get World War 3 going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives. Gotta lock in those $Trillions. Life be damned!!! Imbeciles! https://t.co/ZzfwnhBxRh &quot;The Military Industrial Complex seems to want to make sure they get World War 3 going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives,&quot; Trump Jr. wrote. President-elect Trump has repeatedly criticized U.S. aid to Ukraine, calling President Volodymyr Zelensky &quot;the greatest salesman on earth&quot; and vowing to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the war as soon as possible. Trump also led congressional Republicans to obstruct aid to Kyiv in a drawn-out legislative battle while Ukrainians on the front lines suffered an ammunition shortage. While Donald Trump Jr. does not hold a formal position within his father&apos;s White House transition team, President-elect Trump has been known to regularly consult family members on a number policy decisions. Trump Jr. has previously taunted Ukrainian officials on social media, having shared an Instagram clip on Nov. 10 mocking President Volodymyr Zelensky and indicating that Ukraine would soon lose aid from the United States. Another incoming Trump administration official, billionaire Elon Musk, also mocked on Nov. 16 Zelensky for saying that Ukraine is an independent country that cannot be forced to &quot;sit and listen.&quot; It was not immediately clear if President-elect Trump will reverse Biden&apos;s decision on Kyiv&apos;s use of long-range missiles as neither Trump nor his transition team have commented on the move.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-jr-ridicules-us-decision-to-authorize-ukraine-to-target-russia-with-us-long-range-missiles/	2024-11-17T18:57:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2162154614.jpg
Finnish foreign minister urges Western leaders to refrain from calling Putin, calls for coordinated communication with Kremlin	Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen urged Western leaders to refrain from making additional phone calls to Russian President Vladimir Putin following German Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos;s recent call, Valtonen said on German TV on Nov. 17. &quot;The most important thing is that we understand we must not engage in another race for attention from the Kremlin right now,&quot; Valtonen said on ARD. &quot;It won&#x2019;t help if the leaders of European states make coordinated or uncoordinated phone calls with Putin,&quot;Valtonen added, urging Western cooperation with Kyiv on the matter. Scholz spoke with Putin on Nov. 15 for the first time in nearly two years. The German chancellor condemned Russia&#x2019;s war, urged Putin to withdraw his troops, and discussed potential talks with Kyiv. The call sparked anger in Ukraine, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying the conversation opens a &quot;Pandora&apos;s box&quot; for further engagement and that &quot;it is extremely important for Putin to loosen his isolation, Russia&apos;s isolation.&quot; The call drew a mixed reaction from Western leaders. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau indicated support for Scholz&apos;s phone call with Putin, though adding his trust in the Russian leader is &quot;at an all-time low.&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on X that Western phone calls to the Kremlin will not stop Russian aggression. &quot;No-one will stop Putin with phone calls. The attack last night, one of the biggest in this war, has proved that telephone diplomacy cannot replace real support from the whole West for Ukraine,&quot; Tusk said. In defense of his conversation with Putin, Scholz told the media on Nov. 17 that the phone call was meant to dispel any illusions Putin might hold about the West withdrawing support for Ukraine. &quot;The conversation was very detailed but contributed to a recognition that little has changed in the Russian president&apos;s views of the war - and that&apos;s not good news,&quot; Scholz said, according to Sky News. He also added it would not be good if no European leader were in contact with Moscow if the new U.S. administration will be. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to swiftly end the war by bringing Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table. His imminent return to the White House has also sparked fears that Washington might withdraw its support, forcing Europe and other partners to radically step up their contributions.	https://kyivindependent.com/finnish-foreign-minister-urges-western-leaders-to-refrain-from-calling-putin-calls-for-coordinated-communication-with-kremlin/	2024-11-17T17:16:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/--------------2024-05-29-165945.png
Russian attacks on Ukraine in October killed nearly 200, injured over 900 civilians	Russian attacks on various regions of Ukraine in October led to the deaths of 183 civilians and injured a further 903 people, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine reported. According a report issued by the monitoring mission, 80 per cent of the causalities were recorded along Ukraine&apos;s eastern front, particularly in Kherson, Kharkiv, and Donetsk oblasts. A total of nine children were killed in the attacks and a further 49 children injured. The report noted that 45 per cent of victims of the Russian attacks were over the age of 60. The casualties incurred in October were predominantly caused by aerial bombardment, artillery shelling, and drone and missile attacks. The mounting death toll among civilians comes as Russia continues to increase its use of attack drones, targeting cities and towns across Ukraine on a near daily basis since the start of September. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 2 that Russia launched over 2,000 Shahed-type drones at Ukraine in October. The Ukrainian Air Force previously said that Russia launched at least 4,300 Shahed-type attack drones and similar UAVs imitating Shaheds against Ukraine between August and October 2024. While missile attacks are a common occurrence in Ukraine&apos;s eastern oblasts, most Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, have largely been spared from large-scale Russian missile attacks on infrastructure in recent months. Russia missile bombardments began again on Nov. 17 with a mass aerial attack targeting major cities and energy infrastructure around the country. The latest attack left at least seven civilians dead and at least 19 injured across multiple regions.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-on-ukraine-in-october-killed-nearly-200-injured-over-900-civilians/	2024-11-17T14:43:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2001069533.jpg
Russian attacks on Sumy kill 8, injure 49	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. On the evening of Nov. 17, a Russian ballistic missile hit Sumy, killing eight people and injuring at least 49, regional authorities reported. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack on Telegram. &#x201C;A rocket attack on a nine-story building in Sumy. We know about the dead and wounded, including children. My condolences to the families and friends. The criminal must be punished for killing innocent people,&#x201D; he said. The rocket also hit the yard of the building, causing extensive damage and leaving surrounding homes without windows, the city&apos;s acting mayor, Artem Kobzar, said. Emergency services are continuing to assist the victims, as local media report the ongoing impact of the attack. Russian strikes against Sumy Oblast have become increasingly destructive in recent months, amid fears that Russia may launch a new attack on Sumy Oblast in the coming months. Shelling is a daily occurrence for the communities near Ukraine&apos;s northeastern border with Russia, with residents in the region&apos;s vulnerable border settlements experiencing multiple attacks per day.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-on-sumy-kill-8-injure-49/	2024-11-17T13:19:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/IMG_1117.JPG
UK, France approve Ukraine's use of long-range missiles for strikes inside Russia, Le Figaro reports	France and the U.K. have granted Ukraine permission to conduct deep strikes into Russian territory using their SCALP and Storm Shadow missiles, Le Figaro reported on Nov. 17. This decision coincides with U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s authorization for Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles for strikes inside Russia, a significant shift in U.S. policy following months of hesitation. Ukraine had received several long-range systems from its partners, including U.S.-made ATACMS, French SCALP, and British Storm Shadow, but was not permitted to use them against targets within Russian territory. Ukraine&apos;s partner countries often cited fears of Russian escalation as a reason to withhold approval for firing the provided missiles. The changes in policy from the three countries were long-awaited. Proponents of the decision have long argued that this authorization would significantly enhance Ukraine&#x2019;s defense capabilities, especially with Russia increasing military offensives on many fronts, and intensifying drone and missile attacks in recent months. One of the aspects of Ukraine&apos;s victory plan included a request for greater numbers of ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles and permission to launch them against military targets in Russia, presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak told the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) in comments published on Oct. 14. According to the advisor, permission to strike military targets deep inside Russian territory could ramp up domestic pressure in Russia, weaken Russian forces, and thus change Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s strategic calculus.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-france-approve-ukraines-use-of-long-range-missiles-for-strikes-inside-russia-le-figaro-reports/	2024-11-17T11:58:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/scalp-10.004.jpg
NYT: Biden authorizes Ukraine to target Russia with US long-range missiles	U.S. President Biden has authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles for strikes inside Russia, marking a significant shift in U.S. policy, the New York Times reported on Nov. 17. The decision comes as Russia, with the support of North Korean troops, prepares a large-scale assault on Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region. While the U.S. officials do not expect this move to &#x201C;change the overall course of the war&#x201D;, Biden aims to help Ukraine target critical Russian and North Korean military assets and send a deterrent message to Pyongyang. The policy change follows Biden&apos;s previous hesitance to provide such weapons, out of concern for escalating tensions with Russia. Proponents of the decision have long argued that this authorization would significantly enhance Ukraine&#x2019;s defense capabilities, especially with Russia increasing military offensives on many fronts, and intensifying drone and missile attacks in recent months. The talks on loosening U.S. restrictions reportedly began after Defense Minister Rustem Umerov on Aug. 30 visited Washington and presented senior officials with a list of high-value targets in Russia that Ukraine wants to hit with Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS).	https://kyivindependent.com/nyt-biden-authorizes-ukraine-to-target-russia-with-us-long-range-missiles/	2024-11-17T10:51:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2030058326.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia launches one of the largest aerial strikes on Ukraine, energy grid damage	Key developments on Nov. 16-17: Russia launched a large-scale missile and drone attack on Ukraine overnight on Nov. 17, leaving at least seven civilians dead and at least 19 injured across multiple regions. Multiple loud explosions were reported in the capital, Kyiv, between 6:30 and 7:15 a.m. local time, according to a Kyiv Independent journalist on the ground. Russia&apos;s latest barrage of missile strikes marks the first mass missile attack on Kyiv in over 2 months, with Russia instead utilizing more frequent drone strikes in recent months to attack the capital. Further explosions were also heard in the cities of Kropyvnytskyi, Rivne, Ivano-Frankivsk, Cherkasy, Dnipro, Vinnytsia, Kryvyi Rih, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia, as well as in the Khmelnytskyi and Volyn oblasts. Russia targeted &quot;power generation and transmission facilities throughout Ukraine,&quot; according to Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko. &quot;The transmission system operator has urgently introduced emergency shutdowns,&quot; Halushchenko said. Officials have been warning that Russia may resume strikes on the energy grid as temperatures drop, mirroring the strategy used in the spring and summer of this year and in the autumn-winter season of 2022-2023. Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said that as a result of falling drone debris, an apartment on the fourth floor of a five-story residential building caught fire in the Pechersk neighborhood of the city. One person was hospitalized as a result of the attack, while one other person received medical treatment on-site. Debris was also reported in the Holosiivskyi and Dniprovskyi districts of the capital, according to the Kyiv City Military Administration. Several residential and commercial buildings, a club building, and a library were damaged in the capital. A 45-year-old woman was injured in Kyiv Oblast, suffering a head wound, Governor Ruslan Kravchenko reported. Fallen debris damaged industrial facilities, 21 houses, and other buildings across the region. In addition to the attack on Kyiv, at least two people were killed and seven injured, including two children, in the city of Mykolaiv amid Russia&#x2019;s mass drone and missile attack, regional governor Vitalii Kim reported. In the city of Dnipro, a 42-year-old man suffered shrapnel wounds as a result of the attack. High-rise buildings, an educational institution, and a car were damaged, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. Russia also struck a railway depot in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, killing two railway workers and injuring three, Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia) said on its Telegram channel. It is not immediately clear whether the number of injured includes the 42-year-old man reported previously by the governor. Critical infrastructure facilities were hit in the Vinnytsia, Odesa, and Volyn oblasts, leading to power outages and emergency shutdowns, regional authorities said. Odesa also faced problems with the water supply. Infrastructure facilities were also targeted in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Two people were reported injured in the regional center, the city of Zaporizhzhia. A 59-year-old man was hospitalized, and an 18-year-old man received medical assistance on the spot, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. In Lviv Oblast, 12 garages caught fire due to fallen missile debris. A 66-year-old woman was killed in her car by the debris in the Sheptytskyi (formerly Chervonohrad) district, Governor Maksym Kozytskyi reported. Two more people were injured. Two people were killed, and a 17-year-old boy was injured in Odesa Oblast, Governor Oleh Kiper reported. One civilian was reportedly hospitalized with serious injuries in Poltava Oblast. An outbuilding and a house were damaged in Zhytomyr Oblast. Regional authorities also reported that a critical infrastructure site was damaged in Rivne Oblast, and a house was damaged by fallen debris in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. &quot;Cruise, ballistic, and air-launched ballistic missiles, Zirkons, Iskanders, Kinzhals. In total, around 120 missiles and 90 drones (were launched by Russia),&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said following the attack. This makes it one of the most massive strikes launched at Ukraine throughout the full-scale war. &quot;Our air defenses destroyed more than 140 aerial targets... We are grateful to our air defense forces involved in the attack, our aviation &#x2013; F-16, Sukhoi, and MiG pilots &#x2013; mobile fire groups, electronic warfare units, everybody worked in an organized manner,&quot; Zelensky said. In response to the mass attack, the Operational Command of the Polish Armed Forces scrambled fighter jets to protect the country&apos;s own airspace. &quot;Ground-based air defense and radar reconnaissance systems have reached the highest state of readiness,&quot; the Operational Command added. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force issued air raid alerts across all regions of the country around 6 a.m. local time, warning of the attack. The alert ended in much of Ukraine at around 9:30 a.m. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported earlier in the night that Tu-95 strategic bombers took off from the Russian airfields of Olenya in Murmansk Oblast. Later in the night, the War Monitor Telegram channel reported that a total of 17 Tu-95 strategic bombers were in flight, with seven taking off at the Engels airbase in Saratov Oblast. In recent months, Russia has primarily focused on large-scale drone attacks to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses in cities across the country. The Ukrainian Air Force previously said that Russia launched at least 4,300 Shahed-type attack drones and similar UAVs imitating Shaheds against Ukraine between August and October 2024. While missile attacks are a common occurrence in Ukraine&apos;s eastern oblasts, most Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, have largely been spared from large-scale Russian missile attacks on infrastructure in recent months &#x2014; with the last large-scale missile attack occurring in late August. The EU&apos;s top diplomat Josep Borrell reportedly informed European nations of &quot;convincing&quot; evidence of Chinese production &quot;of lethal aid&quot; to Russia, ahead of an upcoming meeting of EU foreign ministers, the German media outlet Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported on Nov. 15, citing three EU officials. The lethal aid in question reportedly refers to a Chinese firm&apos;s role in attack drone production for Russia in its war against Ukraine. Reuters reported on Sept. 25 citing European intelligence sources that Russia has secretly established a development and production program in China for attack drones to be used in the war. &quot;We have had reports from intelligence sources on the existence of a factory inside China producing drones which are shipped to Russia,&quot; a senior EU official told Politico on Nov. 15. The official told Politico that the EU has yet to determine whether Beijing is aware of the firm&apos;s drone production. China&apos;s foreign ministry has previously denied knowledge of the project. In a separate comment to FAZ, a EU diplomat acknowledged that while there is not any direct evidence to implicate Beijing in the drone production, the official said it was difficult &quot;to imagine that something like this would happen and the Chinese government wouldn&apos;t know anything about it at all.&quot; China has positioned itself as neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war but has simultaneously deepened economic ties with Moscow and backed the country against Western sanctions. Beijing has also emerged as one of Russia&apos;s leading sources of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry. In an interview with ABC News aired on Sept. 24., President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is using Chinese satellites to take pictures of Ukraine&apos;s nuclear facilities for possible future attacks. Although it is unclear what concrete steps the EU will take in response to the reported drone production, implementing additional sanctions may be on the table for the European bloc &#x2014; including adding more Chinese companies to a list of firms facing EU sanctions, an EU diplomat told Politico. U.S. President Joe Biden is also expected to discuss China&apos;s support for Russia on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Peru on Nov. 16. According to the White House, Biden is expected to voice his &quot;deep concern&quot; regarding China&apos;s &quot;support for Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine.&quot; Russia recently began producing thermobaric drones to be used alongside decoy drones in Ukraine, which are capable of causing severe damage to civilians, an investigation by the Associated Press (AP) revealed on Nov. 16. While thermobaric warheads have reportedly been previously used by Russia in Ukraine on missiles, their use on attack drones would mark an escalation of the warhead&apos;s use. Thermobaric warheads create a wave of high pressure and heat that is capable of penetrating thick walls, AP reported. The damage caused by thermobaric attack drones would cause damage that would be &quot;simply terrifying&quot; for civilian populations to endure, including collapsed lungs, crushed eyeballs, and brain damage, according to a source familiar with Russian drone production. While controversial, thermobaric munitions are not prohibited under international law. According to the AP investigation, the thermobaric weapons would be deployed alongside decoy drones meant to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. Decoy drones have been regularly used in recent months as Russia has increased its drone attack on Ukrainian cities since the beginning of September. The Ukrainian Air Force previously said that Russia launched at least 4,300 Shahed-type attack drones and similar UAVs imitating Shaheds against Ukraine between August and October 2024. The Russian production of thermobaric drones, codenamed Operation False Target, is currently in production in Russia&#x2019;s Alabuga Special Economic Zone in the country&apos;s Tatarstan Republic. Russia continues to use drones to overwhelm Ukrainian cities ahead of expected attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities ahead of the winter months. The use of thermobaric drones would likely be used primarily to penetrate thick walls and underground energy substation, ideal for targeting energy facilities. In recent months, Iran and China have continued to supply components for Russian attack drones. Reuters reported on Sept. 25 citing European intelligence sources that Russia has secretly established a development and production program in China for attack drones to be used in the war in Ukraine. While Iran has continuously produced Shahed-type drones for Russia&apos;s use in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war. The EU&apos;s top diplomat Josep Borrell reportedly informed European nations of &quot;convincing&quot; evidence of Chinese production &quot;of lethal aid&quot; to Russia, ahead of an upcoming meeting of EU foreign ministers on Nov. 18, the German media outlet Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported, citing three EU officials. China has positioned itself as neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war but has simultaneously deepened economic ties with Moscow and backed the country against Western sanctions. Beijing has also emerged as one of Russia&apos;s leading sources of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry. The Atesh partisan group sabotaged a key railway in occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast, disabling electrical equipment and causing disruptions to Russia&apos;s military supply chain, the group claimed on Nov. 16. An Atesh operative burned a relay cabinet near the Russian-occupied city of Tokmak, the partisans said, publishing purported footage of the sabotage without specifying the date. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. According to the group, the sabotage occurred between two rail stations in occupied Tokmak. 0:00/0:151&#xD7;Purported footage of a sabotage of a railway cabinet relay near the occupied city of Tokmak. Video published on Nov. 16 2024. (Atesh/Telegram) &quot;Russian forces are intensifying their offensive in the Zaporizhzhia direction. This makes sabotage operations a serious problem for them, complicating logistics and disrupting the regular supply of ammunition and fuel,&quot; the group said on Telegram. &quot;These interruptions gradually undermine the combat effectiveness of Russian troops, slow their offensive actions, and increase losses, ultimately reducing their chances of achieving their objectives,&quot; the group added. In early October, Russian troops reportedly renewed their attack in the Zaporizhzhia sector. Kyiv warned of a potential Russian push in the southern region, just as Moscow&apos;s troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. Amid increased attacks in the region, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command, told the news outlet Suspilne on Nov. 12 that the Russian army is deploying trained assault groups to frontline positions in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The Atesh movement regularly commits sabotage attacks in both occupied areas of Ukraine and inside Russia itself. On at least two different occasions, the saboteurs have previously claimed to attack rail lines inside Russia, targeting North Korean ammunition transported throughout the country. A drone strike damaged a factory on Nov. 17 in the Russian city of Izhevsk, more than 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) from the Ukrainian border, according to Alexander Brechalov, head of Russia&apos;s Udmurt Republic. The factory produces air defense systems, radars, and other equipment for the Russian military, said Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. &quot;Uknown drones attacked the Izhevsk Electromechanical Plant Kupol in Russia. There, Russia produces the Tor air defense systems, as well as radars and other components,&quot; Kovalenko wrote on his Telegram channel. Brechalov reported an explosion and a &quot;drone crash&quot; at an unnamed &quot;factory workshop&quot; on the city&apos;s Lenina Street. One person was injured, and the crash damaged the facility&apos;s windows, the official claimed, adding that there &quot;was no serious damage.&quot; Citing local residents, the Russian Telegram channel Astra also reported that the 300th production unit of the Kupol defense plant, standing at the intersection of Lenina and 40 Let Pobedy streets, was targeted. The claims could not be independently verified. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) says it cannot provide any information at the moment in response to the Kyiv Independent&apos;s request for comment. Izhevsk is the regional center of the Udmurt Republic, lying in central Russia west of the Ural Mountains. This would mark the first drone attack against the region during the entire war. Throughout the full-scale invasion, Ukraine has carried out a number of long-range strikes deep inside Russian territory, primarily targeting the country&apos;s oil and defense industries.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-launches-one-of-the-largest-aerial-strikes-on-ukraine-energy-grid-damage-eu-has-convincing-evidence-of-reported-chinese-attack-drone-production-for-russia/	2024-11-17T10:12:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1239680001.jpg

Sign up here to start your week with an agenda of Ukraine-related events, delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday.The G20 Summit will take place in Brazil on Nov. 18-19. Brazil aims to use the summit to position itself as a lead voice for Latin America and the Global South. Foreign Minister Lavrov will represent Russia (Brazil&#x2019;s Lula da Silva shifted responsibility over the ICC arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin). US President Joe Biden and China&#x2019;s leader Xi Jinping are both set to attend. The G20 summit comes on the heels of the APEC meeting in Peru. China was at the center of multiple major topics discussed: fighting protectionism (and looming &#x201C;Trump tariffs), Korean peninsula security (notably in light of North Korea&#x2019;s entering the war), and Brazil&#x2019;s economic pivot to Beijing. The Verkhovna Rada has scheduled a plenary week for Nov. 19-22, during which the adoption of the 2025 budget is planned. The budget hinges on the president signing the tax hike bill passed by parliament over a month ago (which may be further delayed by prospects of elections). The IMF mission currently in Ukraine emphasizes this necessity. However, the Rada committee meeting meant to approve the bill&apos;s final version was postponed from Friday to an unspecified date. Expect discussions on budget-connected issues next week: porn decriminalization (mostly as a distraction, but also for tax reasons), salaries for prosecutors and teachers, the road fund and local government finances, among others. A second reading vote may take place on a bill defining the legal status of military paramedics, and another one streamlining the procedure for writing off military property (which could simplify decommissioning of various drones and ground-based electronic warfare kit). The first round of Romania&apos;s presidential elections is set for Nov. 24. Current polls show Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu in the lead. Top contenders for the second round include Nicolae Ciuc&#x103; (PNL), George Simion (AUR), and Elena Lasconi (USR). Despite Ciolacu&apos;s lead, polls suggest these three have a real chance of advancing to the runoff. Ciolacu is a strong advocate for Ukraine, supporting its EU and NATO aspirations. The primary threat to Ukraine may be George Simion&apos;s potential advancement to the second round, given his far-right party&apos;s growing support. Simion is barred from entering Moldova and Ukraine for three years, partly due to suspected FSB connections. He staunchly opposes aid to Ukraine, especially military assistance. Reports indicate Russian interference attempts in the elections, involving the use of proxies and social media bot networks. Other events and milestones:	https://kyivindependent.com/the-week-ahead-by-ki-insights-what-we-are-watching-this-week/	2024-11-17T10:04:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/ciolacu.jpg
Ukrainian nuclear power plants lower output following Russian strikes, IAEA reports	Ukraine&#x2019;s nuclear power plants reduced their electricity production as a precautionary measure due to large-scale missile strikes targeting the country&#x2019;s energy infrastructure, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement on Nov. 17. The attacks on Ukraine&#x2019;s infrastructure led to &#x201C;increased nuclear safety and security risks,&#x201D; Grossi said. While the Khmelnytskyi, Rivne, and South Ukrainian plants remained operational and avoided direct hits, several substations critical to their power supply were damaged. Grossi emphasized the vulnerability of Ukraine&#x2019;s energy network and reiterated the importance of securing a reliable external power supply to nuclear facilities, a key IAEA safety principle. Russia launched a large-scale missile and drone attack on Ukraine overnight on Nov. 17, leaving at least seven civilians dead and at least 19 injured across multiple regions. Russia targeted &quot;power generation and transmission facilities throughout Ukraine,&quot; according to Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko. Officials have been warning that Russia may resume strikes on the energy grid as temperatures drop, mirroring the strategy used in the spring and summer of this year and in the autumn-winter season of 2022-2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-nuclear-power-plants-lower-output-following-russian-strikes-iaea-reports/	2024-11-17T09:22:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1239680001.jpg
Russian opposition holds anti-war march in Berlin	A march organized by Russian opposition exiled leaders Yulia Navalnaya, Vladimir Kara-Murza, and Ilya Yashin in protest against Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine and President Vladimir Putin&apos;s regime began in Berlin on Nov. 17. The event&apos;s participants are calling for Russia&apos;s withdrawal from Ukraine, the release of political prisoners, and to try Putin as a war criminal, Deutsche Welle reported. The event, which had been planned in advance, took place the same day as Russia launched one of its largest strikes on Ukrainian cities and the energy grid, killing and injuring civilians. While the German police estimated the initial number of participants to be 1,800, the independent news outlet Meduza counted up to 6,000-7,000 people. The march moved from the Potsdamer Platz (Square) to the Brandenburg Gate, ending the procession at the nearby Russian embassy building. Navalnaya, Kara-Murza, and Yashin were in attendance. Russian opposition politicians in exile Yulia Navalnaya (C), Vladimir Kara-Murza (L), and Ilya Yashin (R) attend an anti-war demonstration they organized on Nov. 17, 2024, in Berlin, Germany. They were demanding an end to the rule of Russian President Vladimir Putin and an end to Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. (Axel Schmidt/Getty Images)Navalnaya took up a more visible public role after the death of her husband, Alexei Navalny, in a Russian penal colony in February. She has directly accused Putin of being responsible for her husband&apos;s death. Kara-Murza and Yashin, who were jailed in Russia as political prisoners, were released on Aug. 1 in a large-scale prisoner swap between Moscow and the West. Videos shared by the media show participants waving both Ukrainian and blue-and-white Russian opposition flags and chanting &quot;No to war,&quot; &quot;Putin is a murderer,&quot; and &quot;Russia without Putin.&quot; Others held banners with pro-Ukrainian statements, such as &quot;Ukraine&apos;s victory is also ours&quot; and &quot;We stand with Ukraine.&quot; According to Deutsche Welle, an incident broke out when two participants brought the tricolor of the Russian Federation to the march, leading to angry protests from other demonstrators. &quot;Putin is not Russia. Russia is us. We are against the war, against aggression. We support free, peaceful Russia,&quot; Yashin said in a speech. Russian opposition leaders have denounced the war and Putin&apos;s regime but have also come under criticism from Ukraine for calling for reduced sanctions against Russia as a whole, urging instead more targeted measures against the leadership. Asked in an interview with the German outlet Zeit whether it is correct to supply arms to Ukraine, Navalnaya responded: &quot;It&apos;s difficult to say. The war was unleashed by Vladimir Putin, but the bombs are hitting Russians too.&quot; &quot;All Russian troops must be withdrawn from the territory of Ukraine immediately. The war must end immediately,&quot; she added. Oleksii Makeiev, Ukraine&apos;s ambassador to Germany, called the march &quot;dignified and inconsequential&quot; and a &quot;PR campaign whose target group is not the Russian population, but German media and politicians.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-opposition-holds-anti-war-march-in-berlin/	2024-11-17T07:40:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184593713.jpg
Canada's Trudeau signals support for Scholz-Putin call, Poland's Tusk says phone calls won't stop Russia	Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau indicated support for German Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos;s recent phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, though adding his trust in the Russian leader is &quot;at an all-time low,&quot; Bloomberg reported on Nov. 17. &quot;We all understand how important it is to see an end to the violence in Ukraine, to see an end to conflicts around the world,&quot; Trudeau told Bloomberg during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru, which took place between Nov. 15-16. &quot;That requires a level of engagement with counterparts who in many cases we disagree with.&quot; Scholz spoke with Putin on Nov. 15 for the first time in nearly two years. The German chancellor condemned Russia&#x2019;s war, urged Putin to withdraw his troops, and discussed potential talks with Kyiv. The call sparked anger in Ukraine, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying the conversation opens a &quot;Pandora&apos;s box&quot; for further engagement and that &quot;it is extremely important for Putin to loosen his isolation, Russia&apos;s isolation.&quot; Trudeau added that Canada and other partners are closely engaging with Zelensky and that &quot;it&apos;s a good thing that there are conversations around this, but the level of trust that I have for Vladimir Putin is probably at an all-time low right now.&quot; The phone call came under fresh criticism from Ukraine and elsewhere following a mass Russian drone and missile strike early on Nov. 17. &quot;No-one will stop Putin with phone calls. The attack last night, one of the biggest in this war, has proved that telephone diplomacy cannot replace real support from the whole West for Ukraine,&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on X. &quot;This is war criminal Putin&#x2019;s true response to all those who called and visited him recently. We need peace through strength, not appeasement,&quot; Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha commented. In his defense, Scholz told the media on Nov. 17 that the phone call was meant to dispel any illusions Putin might hold about the West withdrawing support for Ukraine. &quot;The conversation was very detailed but contributed to a recognition that little has changed in the Russian president&apos;s views of the war - and that&apos;s not good news,&quot; Scholz said, according to Sky News. He also added it would not be good if no European leader were in contact with Moscow if the new U.S. administration will be. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to swiftly end the war by bringing Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table. His imminent return to the White House has also sparked fears that Washington might withdraw its support, forcing Europe and other partners to radically step up their contributions.	https://kyivindependent.com/canadas-pm-trudeau-signals-support-for-scholz-putin-call/	2024-11-17T06:41:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1683460359.jpg
Musk mocks Zelensky for comments about Ukraine's independence	Elon Musk, a billionaire and close ally of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, mocked on Nov. 16 President Volodymyr Zelensky for saying that Ukraine is an independent country that cannot be forced to &quot;sit and listen.&quot; Initially a supporter of Ukraine, the SpaceX and Tesla CEO and one of the world&apos;s richest people has made progressively controversial remarks about the besieged country as the war progressed. The billionaire reposted a modified excerpt from Zelensky&apos;s interview with the Suspilne broadcaster shared on X, which read: &quot;The U.S. cannot force us to &apos;sit and listen&apos; at the negotiating table. We are an independent country.&quot; Musk added his own comments, mockingly saying, &quot;(His) sense of humor is amazing.&quot; He also attached a link to a BBC article published in 2021, presenting Zelensky as a &quot;comedian who had no experience of politics when elected.&quot; The article was updated after the outbreak of the full-scale invasion, saying that the president &quot;has suddenly emerged as a convincing war leader.&quot; He sense of humor is amazing &#x1F602;https://t.co/4BL4rTXaZS https://t.co/pacq5vNkza In the interview with Suspilne, Zelensky was asked what messages he received from Trump regarding possible negotiations with Russia. The U.S. president-elect previously said he would end the war within &quot;24 hours,&quot; and his team pledged to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table. &quot;We are independent Ukraine. I think that during this war, our people and I personally, in negotiations with the U.S., with Trump, Biden, and European leaders, have shown that the rhetoric &apos;sit and listen&apos; does not work with us,&quot; Zelensky responded. Musk made the post shortly after two U.S. Democratic senators called upon the government to investigate reports of Musk&apos;s communications with Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin. The Wall Street Journal&#x2019;s recent report cited U.S., European, and Russian officials who claimed Musk had several conversations with Putin and Russian Deputy Chief of Staff Sergei Kiriyenko. Musk responded on his X network that he is &quot;going to find out who&apos;s making these accusations and nuke them.&quot; The billionaire is seen as becoming increasingly influential in Trump&apos;s team and has been tapped to lead the &quot;Department of Government Efficiency,&quot; a newly-proposed advisory body. According to Axios, Musk joined on a phone call between Zelensky and Trump shortly after the latter&apos;s election victory, reportedly saying he would continue to support Ukraine through his Starlink satellites.	https://kyivindependent.com/musk-mocks-zelensky/	2024-11-17T06:03:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/2023-10-06-15.30.20.jpg
Russia shows it has no intention of ceasing its aggression' — Kyiv's partners condemn Russian mass attack	Ukraine&apos;s international partners have denounced Russia&apos;s most recent mass aerial strike launched against the country on Nov. 17. &quot;As we approach 1000 days since the large-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia shows it has no intention of ceasing its aggression,&quot; said Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp. Russia launched 120 missiles and 90 drones against Ukraine, hitting energy infrastructure and residential areas across the country in what became one of the largest attacks during the war. &quot;The Netherlands will continue to support Ukraine in every way: politically, militarily, financially, and morally,&quot; Veldkamp said on X. &quot;Norway condemns this illegal war and continues to #StandWithUkraine, providing arms and support against Russia&#x2019;s aggression,&quot; Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in the wake of the attack. According to U.S. Ambassador to Kyiv Bridget A. Brink, the attack underscores how &quot;Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine threatens the security of all of Europe.&quot; Moldova&apos;s recently re-elected president, Maia Sandu, joined the condemnations, saying, &quot;Weaponizing winter to freeze a nation into submission is cruel and unacceptable. Moldova stands with Ukraine.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s neighbor Moldova has felt the effect of Russian attacks more directly, with missile and drone wreckage being discovered on Moldovan territory on several occasions. Russia&apos;s latest barrage of missile strikes marks the first mass missile attack on Kyiv in over 2 months, with Russia instead utilizing more frequent drone strikes in recent months to attack the capital. Moscow targeted &quot;power generation and transmission facilities throughout Ukraine,&quot; according to Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko. &quot;The transmission system operator has urgently introduced emergency shutdowns,&quot; Halushchenko said. Officials have been warning that Russia may resume strikes on the energy grid as temperatures drop, mirroring the strategy used in the spring and summer of this year and in the autumn-winter season of 2022-2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-partners-condemn-russian-attack/	2024-11-17T04:26:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Rivne-Oblast.jpg
Russian defense plant over 1,300 km from Ukraine reportedly hit by drone strike	A drone strike damaged a factory on Nov. 17 in the Russian city of Izhevsk, more than 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) from the Ukrainian border, according to Alexander Brechalov, head of Russia&apos;s Udmurt Republic. The factory produces air defense systems, radars, and other equipment for the Russian military, said Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. &quot;Uknown drones attacked the Izhevsk Electromechanical Plant Kupol in Russia. There, Russia produces the Tor air defense systems, as well as radars and other components,&quot; Kovalenko wrote on his Telegram channel. Brechalov reported an explosion and a &quot;drone crash&quot; at an unnamed &quot;factory workshop&quot; on the city&apos;s Lenina Street. One person was injured, and the crash damaged the facility&apos;s windows, the official claimed, adding that there &quot;was no serious damage.&quot; Citing local residents, the Russian Telegram channel Astra also reported that the 300th production unit of the Kupol defense plant, standing at the intersection of Lenina and 40 Let Pobedy streets, was targeted. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Izhevsk is the regional center of the Udmurt Republic, lying in central Russia west of the Ural Mountains. This would mark the first drone attack against the region during the entire war. Throughout the full-scale invasion, Ukraine has carried out a number of long-range strikes deep inside Russian territory, primarily targeting the country&apos;s oil and defense industries.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-plant-producing-air-defenses-allegedly-hit-by-drones/	2024-11-17T03:48:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-177207745.jpg
Ukraine's air defense downs 102 missiles, 42 drones during mass Russian strike	Ukrainian air defenses shot down 102 of the 120 missiles and 42 of the 90 drones launched by Russia overnight on Nov. 17, the Air Force reported. Russian forces launched one of the heaviest aerial strikes against the country throughout the full-scale war, primarily targeting the energy grid. During the attack, Russia deployed seven Tu-160, 16 Tu-95MS, and two Tu-22M3 bomber planes, five Su-34 fighter-bombers, four Su-27 fighter jets, 10 MiG-31K Kinzhal missile carriers, and four naval missile carriers, according to the Air Force. Russia attacked Ukraine with a hypersonic 3M22 Zirkon missile, seven air-launched Kinzhal missiles, 85 Kh-101 and Kalibr cruise missiles, one Iskander-M ballistic missile, four anti-radar Kh-22/31P missiles, five Kh-59/69 aerial guided missiles, and 90 drones. The country&apos;s air defenses shot down the Zirkon missile, all of the Kinzhal, Kalibr, Kh-101, anti-radar, and Kh-59/69 missiles, and 42 drones. Forty-one drones were lost across Ukraine thanks to &quot;active countermeasures,&quot; while two flew back to Russia and occupied territories, according to the statement. Air defenses were active nearly all of Ukraine&apos;s regions: the Kyiv, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Poltava, Odesa, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia, Khmelnytskyi, Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk, Rivne, Volyn and Lviv oblasts. &quot;We are grateful to our air defense forces involved in the attack, our aviation &#x2013; F-16, Sukhoi, and MiG pilots &#x2013; mobile fire groups, electronic warfare units, everybody worked in an organized manner,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said. At least seven civilians were killed and at least 19 injured across multiple regions, according to preliminary data.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-downs-102-missiles-42-drones/	2024-11-17T03:02:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Frankiv.jpg
We need peace through strength, not appeasement' — Ukraine's FM reacts to Russian mass attack	Russia&apos;s latest mass attack on Ukraine shows Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s true response to attempts at appeasement, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Nov. 17. &quot;Russia launched one of the largest air attacks: drones and missiles against peaceful cities, sleeping civilians, critical infrastructure,&quot; Sybiha said. Ukrainian air defenses shot down around 140 of the 210 drones and missiles launched at the country, primarily targeting the energy grid. &quot;This is war criminal Putin&#x2019;s true response to all those who called and visited him recently. We need peace through strength, not appeasement.&quot; German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Nov. 15 held the first phone call with Putin in two years, during which he condemned Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine, urged Putin to withdraw his troops, and discussed potential talks with Kyiv. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry expressed concerns over the Scholz-Putin call, saying that such lengthy conversations have been a tool Putin has exploited for over 20 years, now providing him hope for easing his international isolation. The call came amid growing uncertainties about the stability of Western support and Ukraine&apos;s setbacks on the battlefield. Donald Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. election adds to the uncertainties, with some fearing that Washington might withdraw its support and force Kyiv toward painful concessions. In turn, top Ukrainian officials voiced hope for a more resolute decision-making. &quot;Certainly, with the policies of this team that will now lead the White House, the war will end faster. This is their approach, their promise to their society, and it is also very important to them,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/fm-reacts-to-russian-mass-attack/	2024-11-17T02:27:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Odesa-12.jpg
Biden meets Xi, condemns North Korean troops dispatch to Russia	Outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Lima on Nov. 16 &#xA0;to discuss a &quot;range of bilateral, regional, and global issues,&quot; the White House said. Biden met the Chinese leader on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, marking his last meeting with Xi before leaving office in January 2025. &quot;President Biden condemned the deployment of thousands of (North Korean) troops to Russia, a dangerous expansion of Russia&#x2019;s unlawful war against Ukraine with serious consequences for both European and Indo-Pacific peace and security,&quot; the White House statement read. Pyongyang has deployed around 11,000 troops to reinforce Moscow&apos;s troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, in addition to already provided artillery and missiles. China, a close partner to both Russia and North Korea, has claimed it had no knowledge of the troop transfer, though some experts disputed this statement. Biden also &quot;expressed deep concern over (China&apos;s) continued support for Russia&#x2019;s defense industrial base.&quot; While claiming neutrality in the Russia-Ukraine war, China has become Russia&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods, helping to sustain the Russian defense industry amid the invasion. The German media outlet Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) recently reported that the EU obtained evidence that this support has expanded to &quot;lethal aid,&quot; specifically the production of attack drones. During the meeting, Xi claimed that China&apos;s position regarding the war has &quot;always been fair and square,&quot; the Xinhua state news agency reported. The Chinese president also said his country would &quot;not allow conflict and turmoil to happen on the Korean Peninsula&quot; and that Beijing would &quot;not sit idly by&quot; while its strategic interests are endangered, Xinhua wrote. Biden is concluding his term before the inauguration of his political rival and former president, Donald Trump, whose return to the White House may significantly impact Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine and security worldwide.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-meets-xi/	2024-11-17T01:46:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184468400.jpg
Russia attacks thermal power plants, dealing 'serious damage,' operator says	Russia targeted thermal power plants during a mass strike on the country&apos;s power grid on Nov. 17, dealing &quot;serious damage,&quot; said the country&apos;s largest private energy company, DTEK. Russia targeted energy facilities throughout Ukraine in what was one of the heaviest strikes on the country&apos;s power grid during the entire full-scale war, with Russia launching around 120 missiles and 90 drones. &quot;DTEK thermal power plants came under attack. According to preliminary data, there were no casualties,&quot; the company said in a statement. The location of the energy stations was not specified, presumably due to security reasons. Energy equipment was heavily damaged, but DTEK employees began repair work after the end of the attack. The company says this marks the eighth mass attack on its energy plants this year. &quot;In total, since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, DTEK thermal power plants have been fired upon more than 190 times,&quot; the energy operator said. Russia targeted &quot;power generation and transmission facilities throughout Ukraine,&quot; according to Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko. &quot;The transmission system operator has urgently introduced emergency shutdowns,&quot; Halushchenko said. Energy infrastructure facilities were reported as damaged in the Volyn and Vinnytsia oblasts. Officials have been warning that Russia may resume strikes on the energy grid as temperatures drop, mirroring the strategy used in the spring and summer of this year and in the autumn-winter season of 2022-2023. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in September that past Russian attacks had destroyed all of Ukraine&apos;s thermal power plants and almost all hydroelectric capacity. Ukrainian authorities and energy companies have been repairing and reinforcing energy facilities in the expectation of renewed attacks. According to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter as a result of the attacks, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand. This summer, the power shortage was 2.5 GW when Kyiv was already experiencing long blackouts.	https://kyivindependent.com/thermal-power-plant-seriously-damaged-in-russian-attack-operator-says/	2024-11-17T00:46:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1247620233.jpg

1 killed, 6 injured in Mykolaiv amid Russia’s mass missile and drone attack	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. At least one person was killed and six injured, including two children, in the city of Mykolaiv amid Russia&#x2019;s mass drone and missile attack, regional governor Vitalii Kim reported on Nov. 17. The attack damaged several private residences, a multi-story building, cars, a shopping center, and an infrastructure facility, according to the governor. Multiple loud explosions were also reported in the capital Kyiv between 6:30 and 7:15 a.m. local time, according to a Kyiv Independent journalist on the ground. Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitshko said that as a result of falling drone debris, an apartment on the fourth floor of five-story residential building caught fire in the Pechersk neighborhood of the city. One person was hospitalized as a result of the attack, while one other person received medical treatment on-site. Further explosions were also heard in the cities of Kropyvnytskyi, Rivne, Ivano-Frankivsk, Cherkasy, Dnipro, Vinnytsia, Kryvyi Rih, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia, and Khmelnytskyi Oblast. Multiple cruise, ballistic and hypersonic missiles were reportedly launched from the Black Sea, as well as Russia&apos;s Astrakhan Oblast and Krasnodar Krai, toward multiple regions.	https://kyivindependent.com/1-killed-6-injured-in-mykolaiv-amid-russias-mass-missile-and-drone-attack/	2024-11-16T21:40:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1415735122.jpg
Russia launches large-scale missile attack on Ukraine, explosions heard in multiple cities	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched a large-scale missile attack on Ukraine overnight on Nov. 17. No information was immediately available as to any damage or casualties reported, although multiple ballistic missiles were reportedly launched from the Black Sea, as well as Russia&apos;s Astrakhan Oblast and Krasnodar Krai, toward Kyiv. Explosions were reported in the capital Kyiv around 6:30 a.m. local time, according to a Kyiv Independent journalist on the ground. Further explosions were also heard in the city of Kropyvnytskyi. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force issued the air raid alters across the country around 6 a.m. local time, warning of the attack. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported earlier in the night that Tu-95 strategic bombers took off from the Russian airfields of Olenya in Murmansk Oblast. Later in the night, the War Monitor Telegram channel reported that a total of 17 Tu-95 strategic bombers were in flight, with seven taking off at the Engels airbase in Saratov Oblast. In recent months, Russia has primarily focused on large-scale drone attacks to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses in cities across the country. The Ukrainian Air Force previously said that Russia launched at least 4,300 Shahed-type attack drones and similar UAVs imitating Shaheds against Ukraine between August and October 2024. While missile attacks are a common occurrence in Ukraine eastern oblasts, most Ukrainian regions have largely been spared from large-scale Russian missile attacks on infrastructure in recent months.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-large-scale-missile-attack-on-ukraine/	2024-11-16T20:27:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/2022-04-2560px-neptune-cruise-missile-05-1024x689.jpg
Ukrainian partisans say they sabotaged railway in occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast	The Atesh partisan group sabotaged a key railway in occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast, disabling electrical equipment and causing disruptions to Russia&apos;s military supply chain, the group claimed on Nov. 16. An Atesh operative burned a relay cabinet near the Russian-occupied city of Tokmak, the partisans said, publishing purported footage of the sabotage without specifying the date. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. According to the group, the sabotage occurred between two rail stations in occupied Tokmak. 0:00/1&#xD7;Purported footage of a sabotage of a railway cabinet relay near the occupied city of Tokmak. Video published on Nov. 16 2024. (Atesh/Telegram)&quot;Russian forces are intensifying their offensive in the Zaporizhzhia direction. This makes sabotage operations a serious problem for them, complicating logistics and disrupting the regular supply of ammunition and fuel,&quot; the group said on Telegram. &quot;These interruptions gradually undermine the combat effectiveness of Russian troops, slow their offensive actions, and increase losses, ultimately reducing their chances of achieving their objectives,&quot; the group added. In early October, Russian troops reportedly renewed their attack in the Zaporizhzhia sector. Kyiv warned of a potential Russian push in the southern region, just as Moscow&apos;s troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. Amid increased attacks in the region, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command, told the news outlet Suspilne on Nov. 12 that the Russian army is deploying trained assault groups to frontline positions in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The Atesh movement regularly commits sabotage attacks in both occupied areas of Ukraine and inside Russia itself. On at least two different occasions, the saboteurs have previously claimed to attack rail lines insides Russia, targeting North Korean ammunition transporting throughout the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-partisans-say-they-sabotaged-railway-in-occupied-zaporizhzhia/	2024-11-16T19:56:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-16_04-14-50.jpg
Estonia approves delivery of additional military aid package for Ukraine	Estonia&apos;s cabinet approved a proposal to deliver another package of military aid for Ukraine on Nov. 16, the country&apos;s Defense Ministry announced. The latest aid package will include an unspecified amount of munitions and military equipment, including naval uniforms, observation equipment, sights, and protective equipment. It was not immediately clear as to when the package is expected to arrive in Ukraine. The approval comes just days after Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur visited Kyiv on Nov. 11, where he met with President Volodymyr Zelensky and broadly announced a new aid package for Ukraine consisting of &quot;clothing&quot; and &quot;small arms.&quot; &quot;Ukraine continues to need help from Estonia and the free world to protect itself. This time, the aid package has been put together from the reserves of our defense forces, taking into account the needs of Ukraine, and still in such a way that Estonia&apos;s defense capability does not suffer,&quot; Pevkur said in a statement. &quot;This aid package will not be the last, and in the near future we will open a competition-based annual support measure for Estonian companies, which will enable Ukraine to assist with the production of the Estonian defense industry,&quot; Pevkur added. Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry announced on Nov. 8 that Estonian arms company Frankenburg Technologies will transfer air defense missiles to Ukraine for testing. Estonia has been among Kyiv&apos;s staunchest supporters since the start of the full-scale invasion began, offering humanitarian, developmental, and military assistance. Estonia and Ukraine signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement on June 26. The deal stipulates that Estonia will supply Ukraine with defense aid worth more than 100 million euros ($107 million). Estonia has provided over 500 million euros ($527 million) in military aid to Ukraine since February 2022, amounting to 1.4% of the country&apos;s gross domestic product (GDP), ranking among the top military supporters of Ukraine as a percentage of the country&apos;s GDP.	https://kyivindependent.com/estonia-approves-delivery-of-additional-military-aid-package-for-ukraine/	2024-11-16T18:27:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/estonia.jpg
Iran denies claims its UN envoy met with Elon Musk	Iran&apos;s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi on Nov. 16 dismissed reports about a meeting between Tehran&apos;s United Nations envoy and U.S. billionaire Elon Musk, who is also a close adviser to President-elect Donald Trump. U.S. media outlets, including The New York Times, reported that Musk and Iran&apos;s UN Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani had an hour-long conversation in New York on Monday. The Iranians, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss policy publicly, described the meeting as &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;good news,&quot; the New York Times reported on Nov. 14. &quot;This was a fabricated story by American media, and the motives behind this can also be speculated,&quot; Araqchi said during an interview with state television, reiterating an earlier denial from Iran&apos;s Foreign Ministry. The Iranian minister described the report of a meeting as a &quot;media fabrication&quot; intended to test the waters and gauge the potential for such an occurrence. &quot;We are still waiting for the new US administration to clarify its policies, and based on that, we will adjust our own policies. Right now, it is neither the time for such meetings nor is it appropriate,&quot; Araqchi added. He also emphasized that the leadership had not authorized such a meeting, referring to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.	https://kyivindependent.com/iran-denies-claims-its-un-envoy-met-with-elon-musk/	2024-11-16T15:57:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1678296636.jpg
North Korean delivers 70 missile launchers, artillery systems to Russia's Kursk Oblast, FT reports	North Korea has provided Russia with 50 domestically produced self-propelled howitzers and 20 multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), the Financial Times (FT) reported on Nov. 16, citing a Ukrainian intelligence assessment. The additional support by Pyongyang come as 11,000 North Korean troops are amassing in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, training alongside Russian troops in its fight against Ukraine. A Pentagon spokesperson said on Nov. 13 that some North Korean troops have already been deployed to fight along Russian forces. According to FT, some of the delivered weapons have been moved to Kursk Oblast to assist in Russia&apos;s effort to regain control of the territory it lost to Ukrainian forces earlier this year. The weapons include North Korean-made 170mm M1989 self-propelled howitzers as well as updated 240mm MLRS systems. The reliability of North Korean-made weapons has previously come into question, with reports by South Korea&apos;s intelligence agency that Pyongyang previously sent weapons made in the 1970s to Moscow. With Russia&apos;s military stocks running low and domestic production capacity simultaneously hampered by Western sanctions, North Korea has been shaping up as Russia&apos;s leading weapons supplier, providing Moscow with extensive military packages North Korea has previously provided Russia with as many as 4.8 million artillery shells, South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik said in June. Both Kyiv and Washington have previously said that Russia has been using North Korean-produced missiles to attack Ukraine. In March of this year, Ukrainian prosecutors reported that Russia had fired around 50 such missiles to attack six Ukrainian oblasts since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Increased military support by Pyongyang started rolling into Russia after the signing of an agreement in June during Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s visit to the North Korean capital. The agreement pledged to provide each other aid if either country is attacked, in addition to other military and humanitarian support. On Nov. 12, North Korea formalized the mutual defense treaty with Russia, while Russian lawmakers unanimously approved the treaty last week, and President Vladimir Putin signed it into law the week prior. As alliances between Russia and North Korea continue to deepen, South Korean relations with Ukraine also continue to grow. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said at a press conference on Nov. 7. that the country does not rule out providing arms to Ukraine. South Korea has previously provided Ukraine with humanitarian and non-lethal aid but refused to provide weapons, citing legislative restrictions.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-delivers-70-missile-launchers-artillery-systems-to-russias-kursk-oblast/	2024-11-16T12:32:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157652819.jpg
Russia producing thermobaric drones, capable of causing 'simply terrifying' damage to civilians, AP reports	Russia recently began producing thermobaric drones to be used alongside decoy drones in Ukraine, which are capable of causing severe damage to civilians, an investigation by the Associated Press (AP) revealed on Nov. 16. While thermobaric warheads have reportedly been previously used by Russia in Ukraine on missiles, their use on attack drones would mark an escalation of the warhead&apos;s use. Thermobaric warheads create a wave of high pressure and heat that is capable of penetrating thick walls, AP reported. The damage caused by thermobaric attack drones would cause damage that would be &quot;simply terrifying&quot; for civilian populations to endure, including collapsed lungs, crushed eyeballs, and brain damage, according to a source familiar with Russian drone production. While controversial, thermobaric munitions are not prohibited under international law. According to the AP investigation, the thermobaric weapons would be deployed alongside decoy drones meant to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. Decoy drones have been regularly used in recent months as Russia has increased its drone attack on Ukrainian cities since the beginning of September. The Ukrainian Air Force previously said that Russia launched at least 4,300 Shahed-type attack drones and similar UAVs imitating Shaheds against Ukraine between August and October 2024. The Russian production of thermobaric drones, codenamed Operation False Target, is currently in production in Russia&#x2019;s Alabuga Special Economic Zone in the country&apos;s Tatarstan Republic. Russia continues to use drones to overwhelm Ukrainian cities ahead of expected attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities ahead of the winter months. The use of thermobaric drones would likely be used primarily to penetrate thick walls and underground energy substation, ideal for targeting energy facilities. In recent months, Iran and China have continue to supply components for Russian attack drones. Reuters reported on Sept. 25 citing European intelligence sources that Russia has secretly established a development and production program in China for attack drones to be used in the war in Ukraine. While Iran has continuously produced Shahed-type drones for Russia&apos;s use in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war. The EU&apos;s top diplomat Josep Borrell reportedly informed European nations of &quot;convincing&quot; evidence of Chinese production &quot;of lethal aid&quot; to Russia, ahead of an upcoming meeting of EU foreign ministers on Nov. 18, the German media outlet Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported, citing three EU officials. China has positioned itself as neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war but has simultaneously deepened economic ties with Moscow and backed the country against Western sanctions. Beijing has also emerged as one of Russia&apos;s leading sources of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-producing-thermobaric-drones-capable-of-causing-simply-terrifying-damage-to-civilians-ap-reports/	2024-11-16T10:06:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1242279354.jpg
Zelensky, Japanese Foreign Minister Iwaya discuss North Korean troop presence, support for Ukraine, during surprise visit to Kyiv	Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya met with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Nov. 16 during an unannounced visit to the capital, marking his first trip to Ukraine since being appointed to the post in September. According to a statement from the President&apos;s Office, Zelensky and Iwaya discussed a number of topics in support of Ukraine, including Japan&apos;s concern regarding the presence of North Korean troops along Ukraine&apos;s eastern front. &quot;In light of what is happening with the intervention of the North Korean military in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, it is important to discuss how to prevent further escalation by Russia, already together with North Korea,&quot; Zelensky said in a statement. &#xA0; Training alongside Russian forces in Kursk Oblast, the first North Korean soldiers stationed in the region reportedly came under fire on Nov. 4. During the meeting, Iwaya noted that &quot;Japan stands with Ukraine,&quot; echoing a statement released by Group of Seven (G7) reaffirming their &quot;unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes&quot; and commitment to &quot;severe costs&quot; for Russia on Nov. 16. Iwaya further emphasized that Japan is committed to further strengthening relations with Ukraine, including the expansion of economic cooperation, as well as applying additional sanctions against Russia. Zelensky and Iwaya also discussed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;Peace Formula&quot; as well as Zelensky&apos;s five-point victory plan. &quot;Japan supports the early realization of a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, as set out in the victory plan,&quot; Iwaya said, according to a readout released by Japan&apos;s foreign ministry. Earlier in the day, Iwaya met with his Ukrainian counterpart Andrii Sybiha following a visit to Bucha &#x2014; a suburb northwest of Kyiv, occupied by Russian troops shortly after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine which saw some of Russia&apos;s worst atrocities against civilians during the war. No information was provided by either country as to any specific agreements reached at the meetings. The meeting marks the first trip to Kyiv by a Japanese minister since Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba took office last month. During the meeting with Iwaya, Zelensky invited Ishiba to a visit of the country. Japan has played a key role in providing support to Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, delivering nearly $12 billion in support for the embattled country. Ukraine&apos;s finance ministry said on Nov. 15 that Japan has provided a total of $6.3 billion in external budget financing for the embattled nation.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-japanese-foreign-minister-iwaya-discuss-north-korean-troop-presence-support-for-ukraine-during-surprise-visit-to-kyiv/	2024-11-16T09:06:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/01a42da329c0131b0e76cef1e4724858_1731762990_extra_large.jpeg

Ukraine destroys flag planted by Russian troops at border in Chernihiv Oblast	A day after videos showed Russian troops planting a Russian flag in a grey zone near the border in Ukraine&apos;s Chernihiv Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s State Border Guard Service released a video showing a drone destroying the flag on Nov. 16. &quot;Intelligence indicated that the Russian sabotage and reconnaissance group left the area even before the elimination of the established flags, not daring to take further action,&quot; the service wrote in a statement accompanying the video. &quot;This is another unsuccessful attempt by the enemy to impose its &apos;victories,&apos; and nothing more than a psychological trick that has no military meaning,&quot; the statement continued. Russian military bloggers a day earlier posted videos appearing to show Russian troops planting a flag on the bridge over the Sudost River near the border settlement of Hremiach and claimed they entered Hremiach and Muravi. A spokesperson for the Border Service denied that Russian forces entered the settlements and said that they did not cross the bridge. The spokesperson, Andrii Demchenko, added that no major defensive was detected and Ukraine has deployed additional forces in the area to fend off acts of sabotage from Russia. Chernihiv Oblast is located on Ukraine&#x2019;s northern border with Russia and Belarus. It was partially occupied during Russia&apos;s initial offensive in February 2022, but the invading force retreated in April after the Kremlin failed to take Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-destroys-flag-planted-by-russian-troops-at-border-in-chernihiv/	2024-11-16T07:39:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/--------------2024-11-15---13_55_00.png
Ukraine, US to partner on developing small modular nuclear reactors for reconstruction	The United States will partner with Ukraine to transition Ukraine&apos;s coal-fired plants to small modular nuclear reactors, and to use them to help decarbonize its steel industry, the countries announced on Nov. 16 at the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Baku, Azerbaijan. Small modular reactors (SMR) are an emerging technology that allow for reactors to be transported and assembled on site. The partnership will build a roadmap and provide technical support to &quot;rebuild, modernize, and decarbonize Ukraine&apos;s steel industry with SMRs,&quot; according to a statement from the U.S. State Department. It will also &quot;facilitate the transition of Ukraine&#x2019;s coal-fired power plants to secure and safe SMR nuclear power plants utilizing existing infrastructure and retraining the workforce,&quot; the statement read. Another project announced at the conference, known as COP29, will build a pilot plant in Ukraine to demonstrate production of clean hydrogen and ammonia using simulated SMR technology. &#xA0; Ukraine is expected to face a brutal energy crisis through its toughest winter since the start of the full-scale invasion after Russia took out capacity from half of its electricity generation sector in large-scale air strikes. The infographic showcases the countries with the top percentage share of nuclear energy production. (Lisa Kukharska / The Kyiv Independent)As Ukraine hurries to rebuild its devastated energy structure, many foreign partners are looking for ways to encourage greener and more sustainable energy solutions. Wind and solar projects are in high demand, although many of Ukraine&apos;s infrastructure projects are emergency solutions rather than part of a broader green strategy. Following the occupation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in 2022, the three nuclear plants remaining under government control provide around 60% of its power. However, Russia is eyeing attacks on Ukraine&#x2019;s nuclear infrastructure, the Energy Ministry&apos;s press office told the Kyiv Independent last month. The energy-intensive steel industry produced a tenth of Ukraine&apos;s pre-war GDP, but last year&apos;s production was less than a third of Ukraine&apos;s total 2021 steel production. Energy blackouts are a major factor in the drop in production, alongside worker shortages, high electricity prices, and disrupted supply chains as a result of the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/new-us-ukraine-energy-partnership-will-develop-small-modular-nuclear-reactors-for-ukraines-steel-industry/	2024-11-16T06:48:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1243382977.jpg
G7 leaders reaffirm commitment to 'severe costs' for Russia and 'unwavering support' for Ukraine	Leaders of the Group of Seven released a statement reaffirming their &quot;unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes&quot; and commitment to &quot;severe costs&quot; for Russia on Nov. 16. &quot;Russia remains the sole obstacle to just and lasting peace,&quot; the statement read. &quot;The G7 confirms its commitment to imposing severe costs on Russia through sanctions, export controls and other effective measures.&quot; Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose country is currently serving in the rotating presidency of the group, initiated the statement as the 1,000th day of the war approaches. In October, the G7 announced it reached an agreement to provide Ukraine with approximately $50 billion in loans backed by the revenue from foreign Russian assets. The funds will support Ukraine&apos;s economic, defense, and reconstruction needs.	https://kyivindependent.com/g7-leaders-reaffirm-commitment-to-severe-costs-for-russia-and-unwavering-support-for-ukraine/	2024-11-16T06:19:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2156753132.jpg
Russia cutting off gas sent to Austria via Ukraine, Austrian gas supplier says	Russia&apos;s Gazprom Export announced that its supply of natural gas to Austria is ending on Nov. 16, according to OMV, Austria&apos;s largest gas supply company. The Austrian energy company said it had expected this to occur and will continue to import gas from Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, according to a report from Deutsche Welle. Russia has been paying Ukraine transport fees to carry its gas to Europe through Ukrainian pipelines as part of a 2019 agreement. Russia has been raking in billions of dollars of profits selling the gas to European partners, including Austria. The transit deal between Ukraine and Russia is set to expire at the end of the year. Ukraine has repeatedly stated it will not renew the agreement. Since the outbreak of the full-scale war, European countries have taken steps to sharply reduce their dependence on Russian gas, with the share of Russian gas among EU natural gas imports dropped from 45% in 2021 to 15% last year. Austria, however, has been importing the highest share of Russian natural gas of any EU country, hitting a record of 98% in December 2023 and fluctuating above 80% in recent months. The country has pledged to eliminate Russian gas imports by 2027. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said &quot;the supply is secure&quot; and &quot;no one will freeze,&quot; according to Deutsche Welle. &quot;Our gas storage facilities are full and we have sufficient capacity to obtain gas from other regions,&quot; he added. Earlier in the week, the International Chamber of Commerce awarded OMV a $243 million award from Gazprom due to irregularities in German gas supplies the company was providing. At the time, the company said it saw the potential for a halt in the gas supply as a result.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-is-cutting-off-gas-sent-to-austria-via-ukraine-austrian-gas-supplier-says/	2024-11-16T05:14:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1230851711.jpeg
Ukraine destroys $10 million Russian Buk air-defense system, Interior Ministry says	A drone unit in the National Guard&apos;s 27th Pechersk Brigade destroyed a Russian anti-aircraft missile BUK-M1 system worth $10 million, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko reported on Nov 16. A Telegram video shared by Klymenko, whose ministry oversees the National Guard, showed the system being targeted at &quot;one of the hottest areas of the front,&quot; without specifying which exact area. On the morning of Nov. 16, the General Staff reported that Russia had lost 999 air defense systems since the start of its full-scale invasion, which would make this loss Russia&apos;s 1000th. The Soviet-era BUK-M1 surface-to-air missile systems have been used by both Ukrainians and Russians in this war. Last year, Ukraine announced it had converted the systems to shoot American missiles. Ukraine inherited Buk-M1 anti-aircraft systems from the Soviet Union, but the weapons typically use missiles that only Russia produces.	https://kyivindependent.com/interior-ministry-ukraine-destroys-a-10-million-russian-buk-air-defense-system/	2024-11-16T03:36:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1240557988.jpg
We must do everything to end this war next year through diplomatic means': Zelensky speaks on negotiations, war	Ukraine must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a wide-ranging interview with Suspilne broadcast on Nov. 16. During the interview, he told the broadcaster that he does not believe Russian President Vladimir Putin wants peace but will instead use negotiations to reintegrate himself among Western countries that have isolated him since the start of the full-scale invasion. &quot;I don&apos;t think Putin wants peace at all. But this does not mean that he does not want to sit down with one of the leaders&quot; to negotiate, Zelensky said. &#xA0; &quot;For him it destroys the political isolation that has been built since the beginning of the war. And it benefits him to sit down, talk, and not reach an agreement.&quot; The previous day, Zelensky had warned that a phone call that day between Putin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz &#x2013; their first in nearly two years &#x2013; risked opening a &quot;Pandora&apos;s Box.&quot; In the interview with Suspilne, Zelensky said that as president, he would only be able to negotiate seriously with the President of the United States, which Donald Trump does not become until he is inaugurated in January. A necessary condition for negotiations, he added, is that Ukraine would not be &quot;alone&quot; with Russia, as just speaking with Putin was a &quot;losing position.&quot; He also said that the United States could not take a neutral position as a mediator: &quot;America must maintain the position that Russia is an aggressor, that it has violated our territorial integrity and international law.&quot; Regardless, the war in Ukraine will &quot;end faster&quot; under a Trump administration, Zelensky believes. Zelensky also said that the country was &quot;grateful&quot; for the aid received, but still has not received half of the weapons allocated by the U.S. Among its own domestically-produced weapons, the country is currently testing four types of missiles, he said. When asked about the challenging situation on the frontlines, Zelensky acknowledged &quot;slow, but nevertheless advancements&quot; by the Russians. He cited fatigue among fighters, the slow pace of filling and equipping brigades, as well as delays on weapons deliveries from abroad. Regarding mobilization, Zelensky said that in general, some things need to be adjusted but some things are going as planned, though there still is a need for more mobilization as the current figures are not enough. Zelensky also said that the country expects combined strikes throughout the winter, but considers Ukraine is &quot;a very good position&quot; regarding its air defense systems.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-must-do-everything-to-end-this-war-next-year-through-diplomatic-means-zelensky-speaks-on-negotiations-war/	2024-11-16T03:01:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2169775129.jpg
Germany, China expected to discuss war in Ukraine, North Korean troops next week	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected discuss the war in Ukraine and the involvement of North Korean troops during the upcoming G20 Summit in Brazil next week, German media reported on Nov. 15. Germany also announced on Nov. 15 that Scholz had held his first call in nearly two years with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which he condemned the war and urged Putin to withdraw his troops. The Pentagon confirmed on Nov. 13 that North Korean soldiers had begun engaging in combat alongside Russian troops in Kursk Oblast. The announcement followed reports that Russia is mustering a force of 50,000 soldiers, including North Korean troops, to launch a counteroffensive against Ukraine in the Kursk region. The discussions come at a difficult time for Ukraine, as Russia holds the upper hand on the battlefield, and Donald Trump&apos;s imminent return to the White House may lead to a decreased U.S. involvement in the war. Kyiv&apos;s European partners are increasingly preparing for a deal that could include Ukraine giving up on some of its territories in return for security guarantees, the Washington Post reported on Nov. 13, citing interviews with 10 current and former Western officials. The Chinese and German leaders last met in April when Scholz visited China. &#xA0; U.S. President Joe Biden is also expected to discuss with Xi China&apos;s support for Russia, as well as North Korean troops deployed in the war, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Peru of the Nov. 16.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-china-expected-to-discuss-war-in-ukraine-and-north-korean-troops-next-week/	2024-11-16T00:26:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2147847310.jpg

EU preparing additional sanctions against Iran over missile shipments to Russia	The European Union is preparing to implement additional sanctions against Iranian individuals and entities involved in propping up Russia&apos;s war machine, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported on Nov. 15, citing a top EU official. &quot;There will be sanctions: we have a political agreement on the second package against Iran regarding the transfer of ballistic missiles to Russia,&quot; the unnamed source told RFE/RL. The EU and other Western powers have previously slapped sanctions on Iran after it was revealed that Tehran supplied Fath-360 close-range ballistic missiles to Moscow. On Oct. 14, the EU adopted sanctions against seven individuals and seven entities over Iran&apos;s missile and drone shipments to Russia. The latest sanctions package will target one Iranian individual as well as four entities involved in the delivery of Iranian military goods to Russia. Three of the companies are Russian shipping companies involved with the delivery of Iranian weaponry, RFE/RF reported. &quot;We want to continue the pressure on Iran, sending a clear message to Tehran that it should stop military cooperation with Russia,&quot; the EU official said. Moscow and Tehran have deepened military and political ties since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with Iran supplying Russia with Shahed attack drones and missiles. In addition to formalizing the Iranian sanctions package, EU foreign ministers will discuss during their meeting in Brussels on Nov. 18, readying the European bloc&apos;s 15th package of sanctions against Russia, targeting foreign-made components found in Russian weaponry.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-iran-sanctions/	2024-11-15T21:06:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2002625944.jpg
Japanese foreign minister arrives in Kyiv	Japan&apos;s Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya arrived in Kyiv for an unannounced visit overnight on Nov. 16 in a show of Tokyo&apos;s support for the besieged country. Iwaya will meet with his Ukrainian counterpart Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha in the daytime ahead of a possible meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky, Japan&apos;s foreign ministry told Kyodo news. The meeting marks the first trip by a Japanese minister since Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba took office last month, and the first to Ukraine by Iwaya who was first appointed to the post in September. The visit to Kyiv likely comes in response to the presence of North Korean troops situated along Ukraine&apos;s eastern front, as well as future uncertainty surrounding ongoing military support from the United States following the election of President-elect Donald Trump. The visit also comes ahead of the start of an expectedly grueling winter that will test Ukrainians&apos; resolve as Russian continues to target energy infrastructure across the country. In a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in the U.S. on Sept. 23, Zelensky discussed Japan&apos;s ongoing support for Ukraine, with particular focus on Ukraine&apos;s energy sector. Last month, Japan alongside the U.S. and South Korea also launched a new multinational group to monitor the implementation of sanctions against North Korea, Reuters reported on Oct. 16. Japan has played a key role in providing support to Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Ukraine&apos;s finance ministry said on Nov. 15 that Japan has provided a total of $6.3 billion in external budget financing for the embattled nation.	https://kyivindependent.com/japanese-foreign-minister-arrives-in-kyiv-2/	2024-11-15T20:00:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/gettyimages-2183531318-612x612.jpg
EU has 'convincing' evidence of reported Chinese attack drone production for Russia, media reports	The EU&apos;s top diplomat Josep Borrell reportedly informed European nations of &quot;convincing&quot; evidence of Chinese production &quot;of lethal aid&quot; to Russia, ahead of an upcoming meeting of EU foreign ministers, the German media outlet Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported on Nov. 15, citing three EU officials. The lethal aid in question reportedly refers to a Chinese firm&apos;s role in attack drone production for Russia in its war against Ukraine. Reuters reported on Sept. 25 citing European intelligence sources that Russia has secretly established a development and production program in China for attack drones to be used in the war. &quot;We have had reports from intelligence sources on the existence of a factory inside China producing drones which are shipped to Russia,&quot; a senior EU official told Politico on Nov. 15. The official told Politico that the EU has yet to determine whether Beijing is aware of the firm&apos;s drone production. China&apos;s foreign ministry has previously denied knowledge of the project. In a separate comment to FAZ, a EU diplomat acknowledged that while there is not any direct evidence to implicate Beijing in the drone production, the official said it was difficult &quot;to imagine that something like this would happen and the Chinese government wouldn&apos;t know anything about it at all.&quot; China has positioned itself as neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war but has simultaneously deepened economic ties with Moscow and backed the country against Western sanctions. Beijing has also emerged as one of Russia&apos;s leading sources of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry. In an interview with ABC News aired on Sept. 24., President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is using Chinese satellites to take pictures of Ukraine&apos;s nuclear facilities for possible future attacks. Although it is unclear what concrete steps the EU will take in response to the reported drone production, implementing additional sanction may be on the table for the European bloc &#x2014; including adding more Chinese companies to a list of firms facing EU sanctions, an EU diplomat told Politico. U.S. President Joe Biden is also expected to discuss China&apos;s support for Russia on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit summit in Peru on Nov. 16. According to the White House, Biden is expected to voice his &quot;deep concern&quot; regarding China&apos;s &quot;support for Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-china/	2024-11-15T19:15:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2153185709.jpg
Ukraine's foreign budget support surpasses $100 billion since start of full-scale war	Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has received over $100 billion in foreign-backed external financing to support Ukraine&apos;s state budget, the country&apos;s finance ministry announced on Nov. 15. In addition to military aid to support Ukrainian military efforts along its eastern border, Western countries and institutions have helped to finance Ukraine&apos;s state budget amid increased budgetary pressures on the embattled nation. Ukraine&apos;s external financing is primarily received through various cooperation programs including International Monetary Fund&apos;s (IMF) Extended Fund Facility program, the European Union&apos;s Ukraine Facility program, the World Bank, as well as directly from individual countries. European Union nations rank first in providing external budget support with a combined $40.5 billion, the finance ministry announced. EU member states are followed by the United States with $28.2 billion in support, the International Monetary Fund at $11.4 billion, Japan at $6.3 billion, and Canada with $5.4 billion in budget support &#x2014; all of which amounting to more than 90% of Ukraine&apos;s external financing. &quot;While the military campaign is financed by domestic resources, Ukraine counts on the support of international partners to finance social and humanitarian needs. No country can face challenges of this scale alone,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s finance ministry said a statement. Of the total external budget support, about 33% of the aid &#x2014; or $33.7 billion &#x2014; has come in the form of non-repayable grants, with the United States providing the plurality of the grant funding. Combining external funding with military assistance for Ukraine, the United States leads in its support allocating $175 billion to assist Ukraine &#x2014; although that number includes an number government funding projects associated with the war including domestic weapons production. In April 2024, the U.S. approved its largest foreign aid bill providing $61 billion for Ukraine. Ukraine expects to receive a total of $40.8 billion in external financing in 2024, having received $27.2 billion as of Nov. 14. The total for 2024 is in line with a record high in external financing provided in 2023 at $42.5 billion. Ukraine&apos;s Deputy Finance Minister Olha Zykova said in August that the country would need to increase its external budget support by $12-15 billion for it to meet its domestic needs. Earlier this year, Group of Seven (G7) nations finalized a framework agreement for a $50 billion loan for Ukraine backed by frozen Russian assets revenue.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-foreign-budget-support-surpasses-100-billion-since-start-of-full-scale-war/	2024-11-15T17:57:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2156753132.jpg
Kazakh companies supply electronic warfare equipment to Russia despite sanctions, media reports	Several companies in Kazakhstan are playing a significant role in helping Russia circumvent Western sanctions by supplying equipment for the development of electronic warfare (EW) systems, according to The Insider, the Russian independent investigative outlet. The outlet reported on Nov. 15 that Kazakhastan-based firms, including Askarlab, Dicosta Technologies, Panalem Technologies, and Computer Services Ltd, have been sourcing equipment from Europe, Asia, and the United States, then delivering it to Russia. From 2023 to 2024, these companies acquired products from international manufacturers, including Germany&#x2019;s Rohde &amp; Schwarz, France&#x2019;s Safran Data Systems, the U.S.-based Mini-Circuits, and Ireland&#x2019;s Farran Technology. The sourced equipment consisted of advanced components such as radio frequency filters, frequency analyzers, RF adapters, amplifiers, attenuators, frequency extenders, satellite modems, and vector network analyzers. The Insider cited customs declarations from the Zhetysu customs post in Almaty, along with Russian records and communications involving Askarlab&#x2019;s director. Since 2023, these items have been transported by air, processed through customs, and, in numerous cases, sent to Russia. Askarlab alone reportedly procured high-end radio-technical equipment valued at approximately $2 million between November 2023 and early 2024. The Insider pointed out that Russia&apos;s reliance on alternative supply routes has prompted Western countries to impose secondary sanctions on organizations involved in facilitating such activities. These measures aim to curtail the flow of restricted technology and equipment to Russia amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions.	https://kyivindependent.com/kazakh-companies-supply-electronic-warfare-equipment-to-russia-despite-sanctions-media-reports/	2024-11-15T16:37:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2170787305.jpg
Democratic senators urge investigation into Musk's calls with Russia, Reuters reports	Two senior Democratic senators are calling for the Pentagon and law enforcement agencies to investigate reports of Elon Musk&#x2019;s communications with Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin. Jeanne Shaheen, a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Jack Reed, chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, expressed national security concerns in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and the Pentagon&apos;s inspector general. In the letter seen by Reuters on Nov. 15, the senators argued that Musk&#x2019;s involvement in SpaceX programs should be reviewed for potential debarment and exclusion due to these alleged contacts. Debarment would bar him from certain contracts and privileges. &quot;These relationships between a well-known U.S. adversary and Mr. Musk, a beneficiary of billions of dollars in U.S. government funding, pose serious questions regarding Mr. Musk&#x2019;s reliability as a government contractor and a clearance holder,&quot; the senators wrote. The letter followed reports of Musk&#x2019;s conversations with Russian officials as recently as October. The Wall Street Journal&#x2019;s recent report cited U.S., European, and Russian officials who claimed Musk had several conversations with Putin and Russian Deputy Chief of Staff Sergei Kiriyenko. Shaheen and Reed found it &quot;deeply concerning&quot; that Musk reportedly spoke with Kiriyenko, who faced charges from the U.S. Justice Department this year for leading an AI-based propaganda campaign promoting Russian interests ahead of the U.S. presidential election. Musk&#x2019;s communications with Russian figures first drew attention in 2022 when Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, said Musk had spoken to Putin about the Ukraine war and the Kremlin&#x2019;s &quot;red line&quot; regarding nuclear weapon use. Musk denied Bremmer&#x2019;s claim, saying he had only discussed space-related topics with Putin 18 months prior. Musk oversees SpaceX, which holds billions of dollars in U.S. government contracts with the Pentagon and NASA, and has a $1.8-billion intelligence community contract to develop a spy satellite network. Musk has claimed he possesses a U.S. security clearance, allowing him access to classified information. &quot;Communications between Russian government officials and any individual with a security clearance have the potential to put our security at risk,&quot; Shaheen and Reed emphasized in their letter. The U.S.-Russia space rivalry has intensified since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022. Pentagon officials have condemned suspicious maneuvers by Russian satellites and accused Russia of working on a space-based nuclear weapon capable of disabling satellite networks. SpaceX&#x2019;s dominance in the U.S. space sector, with its Starlink network of almost 7,000 satellites, plays a critical role in U.S. military communications, including those of Ukraine&#x2019;s armed forces on the battlefield.	https://kyivindependent.com/democratic-senators-urge-investigation-into-musks-calls-with-russia-reuters-reports/	2024-11-15T14:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1499013387.jpeg
4 Ukrainian children return home from Russian-occupied parts of Kherson Oblast	Four children returned home from Russian-occupied parts of Kherson Oblast, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Nov. 15. &quot;Thanks to the efforts of the charity organization &apos;Save Ukraine,&apos; the children are back,&quot; the governor reported via his official Telegram channel. &quot;They are safe and receiving the necessary medical and psychological help to recover from what they&apos;ve experienced under Russian occupation.&quot; Since the beginning of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war against Ukraine, Moscow has abducted Ukrainian children from occupied territories and forcibly transferred them within the occupied territories or to Russia itself. According to the Ukrainian government&#x2019;s database, Russia has illegally abducted over 19,500 children since February 2022, and less than 390 have returned home thus far. In a statement released on Nov. 15, Prokrudin said the four children who returned home include four boys, aged between 1.7 and 17. Prokudin said that since the beginning of 2024, at least 229 children from occupied parts of Kherson Oblast have been returned home. Taking hostage people who take no active part in hostilities breaches the Geneva Conventions and constitutes a war crime. Around 1.5 million Ukrainian children who remain in occupied areas of Ukraine are at high risk of being deported to Russia, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said on Oct. 2. According to the Ombudsman&apos;s Office, those from children&apos;s homes in Kherson Oblast were first moved to the occupied territories and then deported to Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/4-ukrainian-children-return-home-from-russian-occupied-parts-of-kherson-oblast/	2024-11-15T12:40:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2030704636.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Scholz calls Putin, discusses war in Ukraine; Drone attack reported in Russia's Krasnodar region	Key developments on Nov. 15: Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke by phone on Nov. 15, their first direct call in nearly two years, according to a German government statement. Earlier in the day, Bloomberg reported that Putin and Scholz were scheduled to speak, though it did not specify the time or topics of discussion. The call, unannounced by either Moscow or Berlin, lasted about an hour, Reuters reported. The last phone call between Putin and Scholz occurred on Dec. 2, 2022. Scholz is the first head of government from a European Union country supporting Ukraine to resume direct contact with Putin. During the conversation, Scholz condemned Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, calling on Putin to end it and withdraw Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. He also urged Russia to negotiate with Ukraine to achieve a &quot;just and lasting peace.&quot; &quot;Germany has unwavering determination to support Ukraine in its defensive struggle against Russian aggression for as long as necessary,&quot; the German government&apos;s statement read. Zelensky warned later in the day that Scholz&apos;s call with Putin opens a &quot;Pandora&apos;s box,&quot; potentially leading to &quot;other conversations and other calls.&quot; Scholz had informed Zelensky in advance of his intention to call Putin. Zelensky reportedly responded, &quot;This will just make Putin feel that the isolation is decreasing,&quot; according to Suspilne, citing an undisclosed source in the Presidential Office. In his evening address, Zelensky criticized any negotiations that could ease Russia&apos;s isolation without meaningful outcomes. &quot;It is extremely important for Putin to loosen his isolation, Russia&apos;s isolation, and to conduct ordinary negotiations that will not result in anything &#x2014; as he has been doing for decades,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;This has allowed Russia to change nothing in its police, to do nothing in essence, and this is exactly what led to this war.&quot; Zelensky also reiterated that there would be no &quot;Minsk-3,&quot; referencing the Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015, which proposed creating autonomous zones in Russian-occupied areas of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts but excluded mention of occupied Crimea. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry also expressed concerns over the Scholz-Putin call, stating that such lengthy conversations have been a tool Putin has exploited for over 20 years, now providing him hope for easing his international isolation. &quot;Even if the German chancellor did not express any positions contradicting Ukraine&#x2019;s stance, conversations with the Russian dictator do not add value in achieving a just peace,&quot; the ministry said in a statement. Germany, Ukraine&apos;s main European backer, is facing internal political turmoil. The center-left coalition led by Scholz has weakened, while opposition leader Friedrich Merz is eyeing the chancellorship. Both Scholz and Merz have pledged to maintain aid to Ukraine in line with current policies. However, an expert told The Kyiv Independent that the Trump administration&apos;s stance &quot;will have a much larger impact on Germany&apos;s policies than whether the next German chancellor is Friedrich Merz, Olaf Scholz, or any other likely candidate.&quot; Russia&apos;s Krasnodar region came under a &quot;massive drone attack&quot; overnight on Nov. 15, Governor Veniamin Kondratiev reported via his Telegram channel. One of the targeted districts hosts a military airfield. The governor said that two municipalities in the region were targeted, with Russian air defense intercepting approximately 36 drones over the Krymsk and Krasnoarmeisk districts. In Krymsk, debris from a drone fell on four residential properties, damaging the roof of one house and a car, according to Kondratiev. In the Krasnoarmeisk district, drone debris allegedly caused damage to the roof of a private house. No casualties were reported. The Russian telegram channel Astra cited local sources suggesting the drones may have been targeting the Krymsk military airfield. This claim has not been confirmed by official sources, and the governor has not commented on it. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the attack. Astra noted that earlier reports from local officials claimed 46 drones had been intercepted over the Krymsk area. Astra said that his statement was later removed without explanation. The Russian Defense Ministry later said that its forces had intercepted 51 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 36 over the Krasnodar region, 10 over the Azov Sea, three over Russian-occupied Crimea, and another two over the Belgorod region. Outmanned and outgunned on the battlefield, Ukraine has turned to homemade drones to try to exhaust Russian combat capabilities as much as possible from afar, targeting Russian military-industrial complex facilities, airbases, or oil refineries. While Ukraine regularly claims attacks deep into Russia, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of the reports and the scale of the damage inflicted. State Border Guard spokesperson Andrii Demchenko confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that a Russian sabotage group planted a Russian flag near the border in Ukraine&apos;s Chernihiv Oblast, but said that the event occurred in the grey zone and Russian troops did not launch a major offensive in the region. Demchenko&apos;s statement comes on Nov. 15 after Russian military bloggers posted videos purportedly showing Russian troops planting a flag on the bridge over the Sudost River near the border settlement of Hremiach and claimed they entered Hremiach and Muravi. Demchenko denied that Russian forces entered the settlements and said that they did not cross the bridge. &quot;The territory where the (Russian) sabotage group operated from the border is actually cut off by rivers, and no one lives in the settlements located between the rivers and the border. In addition, due to the constant flooding of that territory, it is not possible to build proper fortifications there,&quot; Demchenko said in a comment. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s defense forces fully control this axis and are in the most advantageous positions to hold the defense.&quot; Demchenko added that Ukraine has deployed additional forces in the area to fend off acts of sabotage from Russia. &quot;The threat from Russian sabotage and intelligence groups has not disappeared anywhere, in particular in Chernihiv Oblast. Although the activity of saboteurs has decreased significantly recently, the terrorist country has not given up on the use of sabotage groups, including for psychological influence.&quot; The Russian service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) wrote on Nov. 15 that it had confirmed the geolocation of two Russian soldiers seen in footage shared by Russian military bloggers planting a flag on the bridge over the Sudost River. RFE/RL suggested the two soldiers were part of a larger group. Chernihiv Oblast is located on Ukraine&apos;s northern border with Russia and Belarus. It was partially occupied during Russia&apos;s initial offensive in February 2022, but the invading force retreated in April after the Kremlin failed to take Kyiv. Since then, Russian forces have been regularly shelling regional settlements near the border and launching cross-border raids into the region. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said at a Mar-a-Lago event in Florida on Nov. 14 that his administration will focus on the Russia-Ukraine war. &quot;We&apos;re going to work very hard on Russia and Ukraine. It&apos;s gotta stop. Russia and Ukraine&#x2019;s gotta stop,&quot; Trump said at an event in Florida on Nov. 14, according to CNN. &quot;Whether they&#x2019;re soldiers or they&#x2019;re people sitting in towns, we&#x2019;re going to work it.&quot; Trump secured victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, adding further uncertainty for Ukraine regarding the future of Western military aid and its defense against the ongoing Russian full-scale invasion. Reacting to the election result, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Nov. 15 interview with Suspilne that the war &quot;will end faster&quot; under the policies of Trump&apos;s administration, set to take office in January 2025. &quot;A just peace is very important for us so that there is no feeling that we have lost the best for the sake of injustice imposed on you (Ukrainians). The war will end, but there is no exact date,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Certainly, with the policies of this team that will now lead the White House, the war will end faster. This is their approach, their promise to their society, and it is also very important to them.&quot; Zelensky noted that he and Trump had a &quot;constructive interaction,&quot; during which Ukraine presented its vision for peace. &quot;He (Trump) heard the basis on which we stand. I did not hear anything contrary to our position,&quot; Zelensky said. When asked whether Trump had demanded Kyiv negotiate with Moscow, Zelensky emphasized Ukraine&apos;s independence. &quot;During this war, both our people and I personally, in negotiations with the U.S. &#x2014; with Trump, Biden, and European leaders &#x2014; have shown that the rhetoric of &apos;Sit down and listen&apos; does not work with us,&quot; he said. Trump, during a campaign event on Oct. 14, claimed to have &quot;gotten along very well with (Vladimir) Putin&quot; during his first term (2017&#x2013;2021) and suggested that Putin had expressed ambitions to control Ukraine. &quot;It (Ukraine) was the apple of his eye; he used to talk about it. But I said, &apos;You&apos;re not going in,&apos; and he wasn&apos;t going in,&quot; Trump said. Following his electoral victory, Trump allegedly warned Putin in a phone call not to escalate the war, though the Kremlin later denied that such a call had occurred. U.S.-Russia relations have soured since Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, rendering Putin a persona non grata in much of the Western world. Ukrainian soldiers will receive additional financial rewards for completing combat missions in Russia, Taras Melnychuk, the Ukrainian government&#x2019;s representative in parliament, announced on Nov. 15. The update applies primarily to those currently involved in combat in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Kyiv launched the surprise offensive into Kursk in August, and while Russian forces have recaptured about half of the territory initially lost, fighting continues. The Cabinet of Ministers has amended two resolutions regarding payments to military personnel, extending the regulations to include troops serving on Russian territory, according to Melnychuk. Ukrainian military personnel operating in Russia during martial law will receive an additional monthly payment of 100,000 hryvnias ($2,400), proportional to the time spent on combat missions there. They will also receive a lump sum payment of 70,000 hryvnias ($1,700) for every 30 days of combat, cumulatively calculated. Soldiers and officers from the State Emergency Service, National Anti-Corruption Bureau&apos;s Special Operations Department, and police officers performing missions in Russia will also receive the 100,000 hryvnias ($2,400) bonus. Additional payments of 100,000 hryvnias ($2,400) will be made to soldiers wounded while on duty in Russia. In the event of death during a combat mission in Russia, the soldier&apos;s relatives will receive a one-time payment of 15 million hryvnias ($363,000). Ukrainian forces are currently holding off nearly 50,000 Russian troops in the Kursk area, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in mid-November. The Kursk incursion was designed to preempt a Russian plan to invade Sumy Oblast in order to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; in Ukraine&apos;s north and draw Russian forces away from the steadily advancing front in Donetsk Oblast, the Ukrainian military reported. According to Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, Russian forces have lost 7,905 soldiers killed, 12,220 wounded, and 717 captured over the three months of the Kursk offensive.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-scholz-calls-putin-discusses-war-in-ukraine-drone-attack-reported-in-russias-krasnodar-region/	2024-11-15T12:13:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1238504469.jpg
Scholz’s call with Putin risks opening a 'Pandora’s Box,' Zelensky warns	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos;s call with Russian President Vladimir Putin opens a &quot;Pandora&apos;s box,&quot; potentially leading to &quot;other conversations and other calls,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky warned in his evening address on Nov. 15. Earlier today, Scholz spoke with Putin for the first time in nearly two years. The German chancellor condemned Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine, urged Putin to withdraw his troops, and discussed potential talks with Kyiv. Scholz had informed Zelensky in advance of his intention to call Putin.

At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia held talks in Istanbul in March 2022, but the negotiations were eventually abandoned after Ukrainian retook the north of the country and mass war crimes were discovered in the liberated areas. In comments to Ukraine&apos;s Peace Summit in June this year, Zelensky said the Istanbul talks failed because of the Russian side&apos;s &quot;ultimatums.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/scholzs-call-with-putin-risks-opening-a-pandoras-box-zelensky-warns/	2024-11-15T10:59:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2176416230-1.jpg

War will 'end faster' under Trump administration, Zelensky says	The war &quot;will end faster&quot; under the policies of Donald Trump&#x2019;s administration, set to take office in January 2025, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Nov. 15 interview with Suspilne. Trump&apos;s victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election has introduced new uncertainty for Ukraine regarding future Western military aid as it continues to defend against Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. &quot;A just peace is very important for us so that there is no feeling that we have lost the best for the sake of injustice imposed on you (Ukrainians).

U.S.-Russia relations have soured since Moscow&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, rendering Putin a persona non grata in much of the Western world.	https://kyivindependent.com/war-will-end-faster-under-trump-administration-zelensky-says/	2024-11-15T10:04:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1850792057.jpg
What Putin hopes to achieve in Ukraine before Trump enters the White House	Donald Trump&apos;s entrance into the White House on Jan. 20 promises to offer a seismic shift in the U.S.&apos;s approach to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and a potential &quot;freezing&quot; of the war. Trump has repeatedly pledged to end the war within &quot;24 hours,&quot; sparking fears he might push Ukraine toward painful territorial concessions to achieve a quick peace deal that could be favorable to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Although he hasn&apos;t provided any details about how he will achieve a swift peace deal, multiple media reports indicate his plan could entail freezing the war, suspending Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession, and establishing a demilitarized zone in the east of the country. A lot could change before the change in administrations, and both Ukraine and Russia will be seeking to enter any potential freezing of the front lines, and the negotiations that would follow in the strongest possible position. With a battlefield situation currently bending in Russia&#x2019;s favor, Moscow is likely hoping that recapturing territory from Ukrainian troops in its Kursk region, pushing further into eastern Ukraine, and opening a new axis in Zaporizhzhia Oblast could give it the upper hand before Trump takes office. One of the most pressing concerns for Putin will be the sizable number of Ukrainian troops still on Russian soil in Kursk Oblast. Kyiv launched a surprise offensive into Kursk Oblast in August, swiftly moving to capture around 1,000 square kilometers of Russian territory. Russian forces have taken back about half since then and are moving to recapture the rest. &quot;From what I&apos;ve seen, there seems to be this belief that he&apos;s told his military, that they have to take Kursk (back) by the beginning of the year,&quot; Dr. Stephen Hall, lecturer in Russian and post-Soviet politics at the University of Bath, told the Kyiv Independent. And all the signs point towards this &#x2014; on Nov. 11, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukrainian soldiers are holding off nearly 50,000 troops in the Kursk region, including a sizeable contingent of North Koreans. Fighting there will likely be fierce &#x2014; if Ukraine can hold on until Trump takes office, it could make the idea of Putin agreeing to any proposal to freeze the war unfeasible. Freezing the war with a front line inside Russia would likely be a non-starter for the Kremlin. &quot;Russia has amassed forces and will use the same tactics as in Donbas &#x2014; artillery and glide bombs to smash Ukrainian defenses, before small-scale infantry assaults,&quot; John Foreman, the U.K.&apos;s former defense attache in Moscow from 2019 to 2022, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It&apos;s not pretty but it has been effective.&quot; Swedish-made Archer howitzer, operated by Ukrainian members of the 45th Artillery Brigade, fires toward Russian positions in Donetsk Oblast on Jan. 20, 2024, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. (Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images) #foroleksiiDonbasOne of the stated aims of the Kusrk incursion was to draw away Russian troops from Donetsk Oblast in Ukraine&#x2019;s eastern Donbas region, where they have been making grinding advances for months now. It didn&apos;t work. Over the autumn months since the incursion was launched, chunks of Ukrainian territory in the east have been lost. Russian forces have also made operationally significant gains near Toretsk, Chasiv Yar, and Kupiansk. It was reported on Nov. 1 that Russia had seized more territory over the course of one week than at any point in 2024. Russia&apos;s gains have come at an enormous cost &#x2014; according to figures released by Kyiv on Nov. 11, Moscow&apos;s forces suffered their deadliest day since the start of the full-scale invasion, losing 1,950 men over the preceding 24 hours. The figure surpassed the previous record of 1,770 set just the day before, and marks an ever-upward trend that is now months-long. Despite this, Russia at present appears to be able to sustain the losses, even if it is having to resort to ever-higher financial incentives in order to attract new recruits. But even at the current increased pace, it would take Russia almost a year to capture the additional 10,000 square kilometers (3,860 square miles) of territory required to capture the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Putin&apos;s stated goal of the war is the taking all of Donbas, so how this measures up with a frozen war without all of it under Russian control remains to be seen. According to Hall, even if Russian forces don&apos;t take all of Donbas, Putin will use the current strength of his army to &quot;dictate his terms.&quot; &quot;He believes that negotiations will be done from the position of weakness (on the Ukrainian side), that the West is weak, and therefore he will sit down because it&apos;s a way for him to dictate his terms,&quot; he said. &quot;Which will be the end of Western sanctions, it will be Ukrainian neutrality forever, and it will be facts on the ground, these are now Russian lands, and we want a pro-Russian government in Kyiv.&quot; &quot;Russia is making steady if slow progress forward, and may try and open a new axis of advance in Zaporizhzhia Oblast,&quot; Foreman says, adding it&apos;s another way the Kremlin could use territory gained to strengthen Moscow&apos;s negotiation position. Ukraine&apos;s military has already sounded the alarm, warning on Nov. 11 that Russian assaults in Zaporizhzhia Oblast could begin &quot;any day.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence said Russia was planning to use armored vehicles and a significant number of drones, although it is not yet clear whether this will be a single offensive push or separate attacks.

Adding to the tension on the ground in cities like Kyiv, Russia has also in recent days launched simulated attacks &#x2014; launching large numbers of bombers and using electronic warfare to simulate launched missiles, prompting air raid alerts across the country. President Joe Biden has several options open to him, despite entering the lame-duck period between White House administrations traditionally seen as one of waning influence, increasing irrelevance, and menial administrative preparation for the successor. &quot;Key for Biden will now have to be spending down all the funds he committed to Ukraine in September and October,&quot; Steven Wolff, professor of International Security at the University of Birmingham, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;He needs to ensure that happens before the new Congress takes power in early January.&quot; The Pentagon on Nov. 7 said it was committed to sending Ukraine the full outstanding $6 billion in outstanding military aid before Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20. The aid includes a remaining $4 billion under the Presidential Drawdown Authority, which pulls weapons from U.S. stocks, and $2 billion from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said at a briefing on Nov. 7. When asked if the U.S. had enough weapons stockpiled to get shipments to Ukraine before Trump&apos;s inauguration, Singh said Washington was &quot;confident&quot; it could keep its commitments to Kyiv. Speaking to the Kyiv Independent last week, Ambassador Kurt Volker, who served as the U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations in 2017-2019, said there was also discussion &quot;within the administration&quot; of finally approving the use of long-range weapons to strike deep inside Russia.&quot; &quot;Something that the Biden administration has denied until now,&quot; he added. While Ukraine can already strike inside occupied areas of the country, this could have an effect on Russia&apos;s offensive in Kursk. President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that if Ukraine had permission to use Western long-range weapons on Russian territory, it could preemptively target &quot;every camp&quot; in Russia where North Korean troops are stationed. &quot;We are now issuing a warning and believe that if political pressure and corresponding weapons are not applied to Russia, the next step could be a much larger deployment of North Korean forces,&quot; he said on Nov. 7. &quot;Putin always observes the world&#x2019;s reaction. In my view, the response so far has been insufficient.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/what-putin-hopes-to-achieve-in-ukraine-before-trump-enters-the-white-house/	2024-11-15T09:51:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182768275.jpg
Ukrainian military fighting in Russia to receive additional financial rewards	Ukrainian soldiers will receive additional financial rewards for completing combat missions in Russia, Taras Melnychuk, the Ukrainian government&#x2019;s representative in parliament, announced on Nov. 15. The update applies primarily to those currently involved in combat in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Kyiv launched the surprise offensive into Kursk in August, and while Russian forces have recaptured about half of the territory initially lost, fighting continues. The Cabinet of Ministers has amended two resolutions regarding payments to military personnel, extending the regulations to include troops serving on Russian territory, according to Melnychuk. Ukrainian military personnel operating in Russia during martial law will receive an additional monthly payment of 100,000 hryvnias ($2,400), proportional to the time spent on combat missions there. They will also receive a lump sum payment of 70,000 hryvnias ($1,700) for every 30 days of combat, cumulatively calculated. Soldiers and officers from the State Emergency Service, National Anti-Corruption Bureau&apos;s Special Operations Department, and police officers performing missions in Russia will also receive the 100,000 hryvnias ($2,400) bonus. Additional payments of 100,000 hryvnias ($2,400) will be made to soldiers wounded while on duty in Russia. In the event of death during a combat mission in Russia, the soldier&apos;s relatives will receive a one-time payment of 15 million hryvnias ($363,000). Ukrainian forces are currently holding off nearly 50,000 Russian troops in the Kursk area, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in mid-November. The Kursk incursion was designed to preempt a Russian plan to invade Sumy Oblast in order to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; in Ukraine&#x2019;s north and draw Russian forces away from the steadily advancing front in Donetsk Oblast, the Ukrainian military reported. According to Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, Russian forces have lost 7,905 soldiers killed, 12,220 wounded, and 717 captured over the three months of the Kursk offensive.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-military-fighting-in-russia-to-receive-additional-financial-rewards/	2024-11-15T08:41:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166685846.jpg
At least 3 Russian oil refineries on verge of closure, Reuters reports	At least three Russian oil refineries have been forced to halt or scale back production due to significant losses and now face the risk of closure, Reuters reported on Nov. 15, citing five undisclosed sources. &quot;We expect that the actual (plant) closures may take place at the beginning of next year,&quot; one of the five sources said. The Russian fossil fuel industry is a key economic driver of Moscow&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. In response, Ukraine has targeted Russian oil production with long-range drone strikes. The Russian oil refining sector, hit by Ukrainian drones and Western sanctions, is now selling fuel at a discount and charging high interest rates. As a result, three plants &#x2014; Tuapse, Ilyich, and Novoshakhtinsk &#x2014; have either suspended or reduced production in recent months, according to Reuters. This crisis has led to a drop in fuel exports and lower revenues for companies, which in turn reduces state budget income amid high inflation and uncertainty in energy markets. According to Reuters, oil refiners posted record profits in 2021 and 2022, driven by a post-pandemic surge in travel demand and economic recovery. However, margins sharply declined as large refineries reentered the market and demand growth slowed, partly due to the gradual phase-out of fossil fuels. In this context, low-tech refineries have been hit hardest, suffering losses of up to 10,000 rubles ($102) per metric ton for several months in the second half of 2024, two sources told Reuters. State-owned Rosneft, Russia&apos;s oil giant, has been forced to suspend refining at its Tuapse plant on the Black Sea multiple times this year due to low profitability, sources said. The Ilyich and Novoshakhtinsk refineries in southern Russia have been operating at half capacity for several months, processing about 70,000 and 60,000 barrels per day, respectively, due to unprofitable conditions, four sources confirmed. All three refineries were struck by Ukrainian drones earlier this year, resulting in reduced refining volumes, according to sources. Russia&apos;s central bank raised interest rates to 21% from 19% last month, making it more difficult for many plants to survive. Another issue is the rising cost of oil, which in October traded at 50,000 rubles ($502) per ton on the domestic market, exceeding the required maximum price of 35,000 rubles ($351) per ton for independent refiners to turn a profit, Reuters reported, citing its sources.	https://kyivindependent.com/at-least-3-russian-refineries-on-verge-of-closure-reuters-reports/	2024-11-15T08:37:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1209343725--1-.jpg
Scholz condemns war, urges Russia to negotiate with Ukraine in first call with Putin in nearly 2 years	Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke by phone on Nov. 15, their first direct call in nearly two years, according to a German government statement. Earlier in the day, Bloomberg reported that Putin and Scholz were scheduled to speak, though it did not specify the time or topics of discussion. The call, unannounced by either Moscow or Berlin, lasted about an hour, Reuters reported. During the conversation, Scholz condemned Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, calling on Putin to end it and withdraw Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. He also urged Russia to negotiate with Ukraine to achieve a &#x201C;just and lasting peace.&#x201D; &quot;Germany has unwavering determination to support Ukraine in its defensive struggle against Russian aggression for as long as necessary,&quot; the German government&apos;s statement read. Before the call with Putin, Scholz spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and indicated plans to do so again. The last phone call between Putin and Scholz occurred on Dec. 2, 2022. Scholz is the first head of government from a European Union country supporting Ukraine to resume direct contact with Putin. Germany, Ukraine&#x2019;s main European backer, is facing internal political turmoil. The center-left coalition led by Scholz has weakened, while opposition leader Friedrich Merz is eyeing the chancellorship. Both Scholz and Merz have pledged to maintain aid to Ukraine in line with current policies. However, an expert told The Kyiv Independent that the Trump administration&#x2019;s stance &#x201C;will have a much larger impact on Germany&#x2019;s policies than whether the next German chancellor is Friedrich Merz, Olaf Scholz, or any other likely candidate.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/scholz-condemns-war-urges-russia-to-negotiate-with-ukraine-in-first-call-with-putin-in-nearly-2-years/	2024-11-15T07:18:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175014888.jpg
Protesters storm parliament in Georgia's Russian-occupied Abkhazia over controversial investment deal with Russia	Protests against a controversial investment agreement with Russia escalated into clashes in Sukhum, the capital of Russian-occupied Abkhazia. The proposed law seeks to permit Russians to purchase property in Abkhazia. Abkhazia is internationally recognized as part of Georgia, but is under illegal Russian control. Demonstrators rallied outside the local proxy parliament, denouncing the agreement as one-sided and advantageous only to Moscow. Despite the parliament&apos;s decision to postpone the agreement&apos;s consideration, protesters demanded an immediate vote to reject it, according to European Pravda. The protest intensified as demonstrators reportedly surrounded key government buildings. Echo of the Caucasus, a media outlet affiliated with Radio Liberty, reported that protesters threw eggs and bottles at law enforcement officers. Earlier, they used a car to breach part of the fence, gaining access to the area surrounding the building. Shots were reportedly fired during the rally, but local media stated there were no casualties. Tear gas was used to disperse the crowd, according to Echo of the Caucasus. Russian state media outlet RIA Novosti reported via Telegram that protesters managed to enter the parliament building and were advancing further inside. Additionally, the AMRA-Life Telegram channel reported that Abkhaz opposition leader Levan Mykaa announced protesters would occupy the building until the president resigns. This claim has not been officially confirmed. Abkhazia has recently drawn attention due to rumors of accelerated construction at the Ochamchire naval base, allegedly being developed by Russia. Despite satellite imagery showing construction activity, Abkhaz Foreign Minister Sergei Shamba claimed in September that there are &quot;no plans&quot; for a Russian naval base in the occupied region, which lacks a navy of its own. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Ukraine would target Russia&apos;s Black Sea Fleet &quot;wherever it is stationed,&quot; hinting at potential strikes on Russian-controlled areas of Georgia, including Abkhazia.	https://kyivindependent.com/protesters-storm-parliament-in-georgias-russian-occupied-abkhazia-over-controversial-investment-deal-with-russia/	2024-11-15T07:11:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2157386935.jpg
Tbilisi court rejects 11 lawsuits challenging Georgian election results	A Tbilisi court has dismissed all 11 lawsuits filed by Georgian opposition parties and civil society organizations seeking to invalidate protocols issued by district election commissions, News Georgia reported on Nov. 14. The plaintiffs, including the &#x201C;The Unity&#x2014;National Movement&#x201D; and &#x201C;Strong Georgia&#x201D; coalitions as well as the Association of Young Lawyers of Georgia, alleged that violations of voting secrecy occurred during the parliamentary elections. The ruling comes amid the pro-EU opposition&#x2019;s refusal to recognize the victory claimed by the ruling Georgian Dream party, which has close ties to Russia. The disputed results have triggered large-scale protests in Tbilisi. Opposition parties argue that the insufficient opacity of ballots allowed outsiders to see voters&#x2019; choices, violating secrecy. They also reported instances of voter bribery, intimidation, and interference with election observers. Judge Iveri Abashidze dismissed the lawsuits as &#x201C;groundless.&#x201D; Although filed separately, the cases were consolidated into a single trial with the Central Election Commission (CEC) as the defendant. Tamar Kordzaya, a representative of the &#x201C;The Unity&#x2014;National Movement,&#x201D; accused the judge of disregarding the evidence, claiming the issue had been &#x201C;pre-decided,&#x201D; according to News Georgia. The opposition has one final chance to challenge the results after the CEC publishes its final protocol, expected by Nov. 21. Previously, the court had invalidated the results at 30 polling stations, citing voting secrecy violations. Official results show Georgian Dream securing nearly 54% of the vote, but opposition leaders and international observers have highlighted widespread allegations of intimidation, ballot-stuffing, and vote-buying. On Oct. 27, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced that parliament would approve the government despite opposition protests. Meanwhile, opposition leaders have urged international actors not to recognize the results. Georgian Dream has faced accusations of democratic backsliding and steering the South Caucasus country closer to the Kremlin. Earlier this year, the controversial &#x201C;foreign agents&#x201D; law sparked mass protests and violent crackdowns by police. Following the election, the European Commission announced the suspension of Georgia&#x2019;s EU accession process, highlighting the growing rift between Tbilisi and the West.	https://kyivindependent.com/tbilisi-court-dismisses-opposition-lawsuits-over-election-results/	2024-11-15T06:52:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2150070873.jpg
Putin, Scholz to hold first direct phone call in two years, Bloomberg reports	Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz are set to hold their first direct phone call in nearly two years on Nov. 15, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. This call comes at a time of growing uncertainty among Ukraine&#x2019;s allies. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reassured allies during a one-day emergency visit to Brussels that the Biden administration plans to increase U.S. military assistance to Ukraine in its final months. Despite this, European allies have grown increasingly concerned about Western support for Ukraine ahead of Donald Trump&apos;s return to the White House. President-elect Trump is reportedly preparing to appoint a Ukrainian peace envoy to lead negotiations, raising concerns in Europe that such a deal would affect the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Germany, Ukraine&apos;s main European backer, is currently facing internal turmoil, with its center-left coalition weakened and opposition leader Friedrich Merz eyeing the chancellorship. Both Scholz and Merz plan to maintain aid to Ukraine in line with current policies, but an expert told the Kyiv Independent that the Trump administration&#x2019;s position &#x201C;will have a way larger impact on Germany&apos;s policies than whether the next German chancellor will be Friedrich Merz, Olaf Scholz, or any other of the probable candidates.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-scholz-to-hold-first-direct-phone-call-in-two-years-bloomberg-reports/	2024-11-15T06:09:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1238504469.jpg
SBU arrests Ukrainian officer allegedly working as a Russian mole in special forces	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has uncovered and arrested a high-ranking Ukrainian officer allegedly working as a Russian mole, the SBU reported via its Telegram channel on Nov. 15. According to the report, the officer, the commander of a unit in Special Operations Forces, had been transmitting critical military intelligence to Russian troops. The leaked information included sensitive details about sabotage and reconnaissance missions conducted by Ukrainian special forces in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts and Russian-occupied Crimea. Russian forces were reportedly using this intelligence to target Ukrainian Defense Forces stationed at the front lines and in occupied areas of southern Ukraine. The officer, whose identity was not revealed, has been arrested and is currently in custody. He faces charges of treason and espionage, which carry severe penalties, including life imprisonment and asset forfeiture upon conviction. The suspect was recruited by the Russian military intelligence agency (GRU) before Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, and started receiving tasks in the spring of 2024, according to the SBU. The command of Ukraine&#x2019;s Special Operations Forces confirmed the detention of the commander and said they had been aware of the investigative actions regarding this serviceman and &#x201C;fully facilitated their implementation.&#x201D; &#x201C;While special forces operators perform combat missions behind enemy lines in temporarily occupied territories, unfortunately, there are those who try to interfere from the inside,&#x201D; the command added. &#x201C;Special forces continue to fulfill tasks, destroy the enemy, and liberate Ukrainian land from the occupiers. And all those who think that they can interfere with this and put the lives of our soldiers in danger will be exposed and sent behind bars.&#x201D; This is not the first time the SBU has uncovered Russian infiltration within Ukrainian ranks. On Aug. 14, it uncovered a Russian intelligence cell that included two former members of ex-President Viktor Yanukovych&apos;s security detail and an active member of Ukraine&apos;s National Guard. Similarly, on Aug. 27, it arrested another individual in Kharkiv who was passing information to Russian forces about the city&#x2019;s air defense systems and the positions of Ukrainian troops and fortifications.	https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-arrests-ukrainian-officer-allegedly-working-as-a-russian-mole-in-special-forces/	2024-11-15T05:44:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/SBU-badge.jpg
US presence in Poland is 'guarantee of security,' Duda says at opening of new missile base	The U.S. has opened a new air defense base in northern Poland, underscoring a guarantee of security on NATO&apos;s eastern flank, Polish President Andrzej Duda said on Nov. 13. The facility, located in Redzikowo near the Baltic coast, is part of NATO&apos;s Europe-wide missile defense shield system. The Kremlin condemned the move as an attempt to &quot;militarily contain&quot; Russia. Construction of the base began in the early 2000s, and it forms part of NATO&apos;s &quot;Aegis Ashore&quot; missile shield, designed to protect Europe from potential missile threats. Key elements of the shield include two sites in Poland and Romania, U.S. Navy destroyers in Rota, Spain, and an early-warning radar in Kurecik, Turkey. In a NATO press release dated July 10, former Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg described the development as &#x201C;an important step for transatlantic security and NATO&#x2019;s ability to defend against the growing threat of ballistic missiles.&#x201D; He emphasized the importance of missile defense, saying that &#x201C;ballistic missiles have been widely used in conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East.&#x201D; &#x201C;As a defensive Alliance, we cannot ignore that threat. Missile defense is an essential element for NATO&#x2019;s core task of collective defense,&#x201D; Stoltenberg added. During the Nov. 13 opening ceremony, Duda reiterated that &quot;the physical presence of the United States in Poland is a guarantee of the security of Poland and the eastern flank of NATO&quot;, as cited by Polskie Radio 24. The opening of the base follows a defensive trajectory already set by Poland&apos;s &#x201C;East Shield&#x201D; program, which aims to strengthen defenses along Poland&#x2019;s borders with Belarus and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. Launched in May, the program includes physical barriers, modern surveillance systems, and infrastructure upgrades, with recent fortifications along the Kaliningrad border that the Polish authorities started building on Nov. 1. The opening of the new base has been met with mixed reactions. In particular, it comes amid concerns among NATO allies about the U.S. commitment to collective security, especially after the election of Donald Trump, who has said that the U.S. would not defend NATO members who do not spend enough on defense. Polish Gazeta Wyborcza&apos;s Mateusz Mazzini told Monocle that Poland views the situation differently and more optimistically than its allied counterparts. Polish leaders have a &quot;deeply rooted conviction&quot; that Trump&apos;s presidency could be &quot;bilaterally beneficial,&quot; he said. Admiral Stuart B. Munsch, Commander of the United States Naval Forces Europe-Africa, praised the partnership between the two nations. Quoted by Polsat News, he said &#x201C;The Polish and American nations stand shoulder to shoulder in the vanguard of defense against, in the past Soviet, and currently Russian imperialism and aggression.&#x201D; Moscow, meanwhile, criticized the base naming it &#x201C;a direct challenge to its security&#x201D; and a measure to &#x201C;militarily contain&#x201D; Russia&#x2019;s potential. &#x201C;Of course, this (step) leads to the adoption of appropriate measures to ensure parity,&#x201D; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters, though he did not elaborate on what those measures might entail.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-presence-in-poland-is-guarantee-of-security-duda-says-at-opening-of-new-missile-base/	2024-11-15T04:34:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183883812.jpg
Russian troops plant flag at border in Chernihiv Oblast, Border Guard says no major offensive detected	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated as more details emerge. State Border Guard spokesperson Andrii Demchenko confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that a Russian sabotage group planted a Russian flag near the border in Ukraine&apos;s Chernihiv Oblast, but said that the event occurred in the grey zone and Russian troops did not launch a major offensive in the region. Demchenko&apos;s statement comes on Nov. 15 after Russian military bloggers posted videos purportedly showing Russian troops planting a flag on the bridge over the Sudost River near the border settlement of Hremiach and claimed they entered Hremiach and Muravi. Demchenko denied that Russian forces entered the settlements and said that they did not cross the bridge. &quot;The territory where the (Russian) sabotage group operated from the border is actually cut off by rivers, and no one lives in the settlements located between the rivers and the border. In addition, due to the constant flooding of that territory, it is not possible to build proper fortifications there,&quot; Demchenko said in a comment. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s defense forces fully control this axis and are in the most advantageous positions to hold the defense.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-plant-flag-at-border-in-chernihiv-oblast-border-guard-says-no-major-offensive-detected/	2024-11-15T03:58:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/--------------2024-11-15---13_55_00.png
Belarus Weekly: Ukrainian, Russian ombudsmen meet in Minsk to discuss POWs exchange	Two of Alexander Lukashenko&#x2019;s &#x201C;challengers&#x201D; in upcoming 2025 presidential elections drop out before race even starts, pledge support for Belarusian dictator. Lukashenko pardons 31 political prisoners as pre-election police raids intensify. Lukashenko allows the family to visit Maria Kalesnikava in jail, ending over 600 days of holding the prominent opposition leader incommunicado. Ukraine, Russia ombudsmen meet in Belarus to exchange fallen soldiers&#x2019; bodies, discuss PoW humanitarian issues. Rights groups push for international backing of Lithuania&#x2019;s ICC referral over the Lukashenko regime&#x2019;s abuses. Two sham candidates in the 2025 Belarusian presidential elections &#x2014; Siarhei Bobrykau, Belarusian Union of Officers chair, and former spokeswoman of the Interior Ministry, Olga Chemodanova &#x2014; said on Nov. 12 that they were dropping out of the race and endorsing incumbent Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko. The first presidential election in Belarus since the contested 2020 elections, which sent the country into an unresolved political crisis, is scheduled for Jan. 26, 2025. The regime-controlled Central Elections Committee allowed six token candidates to challenge Lukashenko. Bobrykau justified his decision by saying he wanted to &#x201C;ensure the cohesion of the officer corps, and to prevent the military &#x2018;being in two minds&#x2019; about supporting the current head of state and our leader.&#x201D; Belarusian dictator Aleksander Lukashenko walks off the stage after delivering a national statement during the high level segment on day two of the UNFCCC COP29 Climate Conference at Baku Stadium on Nov. 12, 2024 in Baku, Azerbaijan. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Chemodanova withdrew and similarly endorsed Lukashenko, saying that she, like other candidates, would form a &#x201C;reliable rear&#x201D; for him. The monitoring campaign organized by the Belarusian Helsinki Committee and Viasna Human Rights Center said in a statement that &#x201C;such statements by fake presidential candidates are only to be expected, since they cannot exercise their right to participate in the country&#x2019;s governance.&#x201D; The candidates dropped out without even starting to collect the signatures in their support, roughly a week after the Central Elections Committee registered initiative groups to support their candidacies. The remaining registered candidates, Lukashenko himself and four loyalists &#x2014; Anna Kanapatskaya, a sham candidate who took part in the 2020 presidential campaign; Siarhei Syrankou, the leader of the Communist Party of Belarus; Aleh Haidukevich, the leader of the pro-Lukashenko Liberal Democratic Party; and Alexander Hizhnyak, the leader of the Republican Party &#x2014; have until Dec. 6 to gather over 100,000 signatures for their candidates in order to get on the ballot. Lukashenko is seeking a seventh consecutive term in office after over four years of brutal crackdowns on civil society that have eliminated 1,700 non-profit organizations, outlawed all but four loyal political parties, and jailed Lukashenko&#x2019;s main political opponents along with around 1,300 people who are now considered to be political prisoners. The new electoral cycle unfolds while repression continues to haunt those who signed for alternative candidates in the 2020 elections, along with police raids, searches and arrests of people who took part in public protests. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has pardoned 31 political prisoners convicted on charges of &#x201C;extremist activities&#x201D; &#x2014; even as police raids sweep the country ahead of presidential elections scheduled for Jan. 26, 2025. Two women and 29 men were released, although their criminal records were not expunged, leaving them under strict control of the Internal Affairs Ministry, Lukashenko&#x2019;s press office said on Nov. 7, without disclosing the names of those pardoned. Three of the pardoned prisoners reportedly have disabilities, and 17 have chronic diseases. Human Rights activists in Belarus report that prisoners had been deprived of timely and adequate medical help and suffered harsh detention conditions while in prison. This is the fifth round of pardons since July 2024, bringing the total number of pardoned individuals to 146. Even so, nearly 1,300 political prisoners remain behind bars, and over the same period, Human Rights Group Viasna recognized 205 more individuals as having been jailed on politically motivated charges. The release also coincided with nationwide police raids. Viasna reports that over 100 people, including 2020 protest participants, have been targeted since Oct. 31, which activists see as an intimidation effort ahead of Jan. 26, 2025 presidential elections. This will be the first presidential election since the 2020 mass public protests over the last poll, which was deemed not free or fair by the international community. The contested presidential elections in Belarus in 2020 and subsequent nationwide protests sparked an unprecedented crackdown on civil society. Independent media and all but four regime-loyal political parties were eliminated, and Lukashenko regime opponents were jailed or forced into exile. Seven political prisoners have died in custody. The father of prominent opposition figure Maria Kalesnikava has been allowed to visit her in a penal facility, breaking over 600 days of her being held in an incommunicado regime. Photos of the meeting were posted on Nov. 12 by former opposition blogger Raman Pratasievich, who was captured by Minsk in the forced landing of a commercial flight in 2021. He has since become a propagandist for the Lukashenko regime. Former political prisoners recognized the location in which the pictures were taken as the prison hospital, the independent news outlet Nasha Niva. It remains unknown whether Kalesnikava is undergoing treatment or was delivered to the facility from solitary confinement where she is reportedly held. Nasha Niva also claims video footage of Kalesnikava is to be aired on Friday, Nov. 15. Kalesnikava, who led presidential candidate Viktar Babaryka&#x2019;s campaign in 2020, was sentenced to 11 years in prison. In November 2022, she was taken to a prison hospital intensive care unit with a severe medical condition that had developed while she was in detention. Following a brief visit by her father after that hospitalization, Kalesnikava&#x2019;s family was unable to contact her for over 600 days. Incommunicado regimes were imposed on Kalesnikava as well as several other high-profile political prisoners, such as former presidential candidates Viktar Babaryka and Siarhei Tsikhanouskiy, veteran politician Mikalai Statkevich, and RFE/RL correspondent Ihar Losik. Members of Kalesnikava&#x2019;s family, who are actively seeking her release, say they were concerned for her life, and that prison food was unsuitable for her condition. The family visit comes after BBC correspondent Steven Rosenberg questioned Lukashenko on Oct. 23 about Kalesnikava&#x2019;s condition. In response, Lukashenko declared he was ready to consider Kalesnikava&#x2019;s plea for a pardon. He claimed her family hadn&#x2019;t been granted visits because &#x201C;they didn&#x2019;t want to visit her.&#x201D; Ukrainian Human Rights Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets and his Russian counterpart, Tatyana Moskalkova, met in Minsk on Nov. 8, to exchange lists of prisoners and letters from Ukrainian relatives to Ukrainian prisoners of war, and to discuss humanitarian issues amid Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war against Ukraine. The meeting in Belarus, a co-aggressor state in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, is thought to be the first since March 2022. While Belarus provided its territory for Russia&#x2019;s offensive in February 2022, it has also been part of several Ukraine-Russia POW swaps. During the meeting on Nov. 8, the parties also mutually repatriated the bodies of fallen soldiers. Kyiv received 563 bodies, while Russia received 37. One family was also reunited as a result of the meeting. &#x201C;I emphasize that I interacted with the Russian ombudsman to resolve humanitarian issues, return Ukrainians home, and obtain information about our citizens in Russia,&#x201D; Lubinets said after the meeting. The International Committee of the Red Cross also participated in the talks. After supporting the Russian war against Ukraine, Belarus took part in exchanging 103 Russian prisoners of war from Ukraine in September, and another 95 in October. Earlier, in July, the Lukashenko regime also released five Ukrainian citizens imprisoned in Belarus on politically motivated grounds as part of a Russia-Ukraine prisoner swap. Lukashenko claimed he had released a prisoner accused of a sabotage attack on a Russian radar and control aircraft in Belarus at the request of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Ukrainian prisoner was exchanged for Metropolitan Jonathan of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate, who had been sentenced to five years in prison for justifying, recognizing as legitimate Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. Aiding Russia&#x2019;s efforts to gain the release of a convicted Russian assassin, Vadim Krasikov, Belarusian dictator Lukashenko pardoned German citizen Rico Krieger, who had been sentenced in Belarus to capital punishment for espionage, and returned him as part of a historic East-West prisoner swap in early August 2024.

(Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg via Getty Images)The International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), the Norwegian Helsinki Committee, the Viasna Human Rights Center of Belarus, and nine other human rights organizations have called on state parties to the Rome Statute to endorse Lithuania&#x2019;s request to the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate the Belarusian authorities&#x2019; alleged crimes against humanity. In the open letter published on Nov. 4, the civil society organizations urged ICC state parties to &#x201C;strengthen&#x201D; Lithuania&#x2019;s referral and &#x201C;send a united message&#x201D; to the Belarusian regime that &#x201C;the international community will not tolerate impunity for such crimes.&#x201D; The International Accountability Platform for Belarus (IAPB), one of the organizations that signed the letter, reports that residents of Belarus have now sought exile in over 25 ICC State Parties, as well as at least 10 other States that have not ratified the Rome Statute. Lithuania, which became home to Belarus&#x2019;s exiled opposition and 60,000 of the Belarusian diaspora in the aftermath of Lukashenko&#x2019;s brutal crackdown on dissent in 2020, on Sept. 30 formally requested that the ICC investigate the Belarusian regime for its alleged crimes against humanity. The Lithuanian authorities maintain that by carrying out mass repression, Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime has forced hundreds of thousands of Belarusians to flee the country and settle in neighboring states &#x2014; which may constitute the crime of mass deportation. According to a UN special rapporteur&#x2019;s March 2024 report, around 300,000 Belarusian citizens have fled the country of under 10 million for fear of persecution. Despite Belarus not being a party to the Rome Statute, the ICC has jurisdiction due to the alleged crimes being committed on participating nations&#x2019; territories. The ICC prosecutor general confirmed the receipt of the referral, claiming that a preliminary examination of the request is due, and its results will determine whether an investigation will be opened.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-31-political-prisoners-pardoned-family-allowed-to-visit/	2024-11-15T02:36:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/2024-11-15-12_23_46.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 1, injure 19 over past day	Russian strikes across Ukraine killed at least one civilian and injured at least 19 others in the past day, regional authorities reported on Nov. 15. Russia attacked several regions with two X-59/69 guided missiles from the Black Sea and 29 Shahed-type attack drones from Crimea. The Air Force confirmed that one guided missile and 25 drones were shot down. Russian attacks on Odesa, where most of the air targets were intercepted, killed one woman and injured 10 people, the State Emergency Service reported. Among them, a nine-year-old boy is in moderate condition at a hospital, a 22-year-old man is in serious condition, and the rest of the wounded are in moderate condition at medical facilities throughout the city and region, according to Odesa Oblast Governor Oleh Kiper. An apartment building was destroyed, and several high-rise buildings were damaged, Kiper said. The attack also damaged the main district heating pipeline, which served 220 apartment buildings (with a population of 40,000), seven kindergartens, four schools, and a maternity hospital. In Donetsk Oblast, three people were injured in Russian attacks, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. The injuries occurred in the villages of Shcherbynivka, Vovkove, and Shevchenko. Five people were wounded by Russian attacks on Kherson Oblast, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. A critical infrastructure facility, a post office, and 12 houses were also damaged. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, the communities of Nikopol, Myrove and Marhanets were attacked, and a 51-year-old woman was injured, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, Sumy, Ternopil, Poltava, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts were also attacked, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-1-injure-19-over-past-day/	2024-11-15T01:20:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/odesa2.jpg
Drone attack reported in Russia's Krasnodar region, explosions heard near military airfield	Editor&apos;s note: This article is being updated. Russia&apos;s Krasnodar region came under a &quot;massive drone attack&quot; overnight on Nov. 15, Governor Veniamin Kondratiev reported via his Telegram channel. One of the targeted districts hosts a military airfield. The governor said that two municipalities in the region were targeted, with Russian air defense intercepting approximately 36 drones over the Krymsk and Krasnoarmeisk districts. In Krymsk, debris from a drone fell on four residential properties, damaging the roof of one house and a car, according to Kondratiev. In the Krasnoarmeisk district, drone debris allegedly caused damage to the roof of a private house. No casualties were reported. The Russian telegram channel Astra cited local sources suggesting the drones may have been targeting the Krymsk military airfield. This claim has not been confirmed by official sources, and the governor has not commented on it. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the attack. Astra noted that earlier reports from local officials claimed 46 drones had been intercepted over the Krymsk area. Astra said that his statement was later removed without explanation. The Russian Defense Ministry later said that its forces had intercepted 51 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 36 over the Krasnodar region, 10 over the Azov Sea, three over Russian-occupied Crimea, and another two over the Belgorod region. &#xA0; Outmanned and outgunned on the battlefield, Ukraine has turned to homemade drones to try to exhaust Russian combat capabilities as much as possible from afar, targeting Russian military-industrial complex facilities, airbases, or oil refineries. While Ukraine regularly claims attacks deep into Russia, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of the reports and the scale of the damage inflicted.	https://kyivindependent.com/drone-attack-reported-in-russias-krasnodar-region-explosions-heard-near-military-airfield/	2024-11-14T23:36:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1592375370.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 717,590 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 717,590 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Nov. 15. This number includes 1,520 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,330 tanks, 18,968 armored fighting vehicles, 29,167 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,492 artillery systems, 1,252 multiple launch rocket systems, 999 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 18,886 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-717-590-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-11-14T22:21:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1243747572.jpg
Austria's OMV secures $243 million arbitral award for Gazprom's irregular German gas supplies	Austrian integrated oil and gas company OMV announced on Nov. 13 that it had secured an arbitral award from the International Chamber of Commerce exceeding $243 million (230 million euros). This ruling relates to irregularities in German gas supplies provided by Gazprom. OMV noted that the award, which includes interest and costs, will help offset the financial losses it suffered in 2022. The company anticipates that its contract with Gazprom Export, a subsidiary of the Russian energy giant, could worsen, potentially resulting in a halt to gas supply. To mitigate the impact, OMV confirmed plans to offset claims against invoices under its Austrian gas supply contract with Gazprom Export. OMV estimates that the potentially affected gas volume for Austria&apos;s Virtual Trading Point could reach up to 7,400 megawatt-hours. Despite the possible disruption, the company assured customers that it would deliver the full contracted gas volumes. &quot;We have been preparing for a possible supply disruption for a long time. In any case, our country&apos;s gas supply is secure. Our gas storage facilities are full,&quot; Austrian Energy Minister Leonore Gewessler said on X. In May, OMV cautioned that Gazprom&apos;s gas supplies might face suspension due to a court ruling, although it did not specify the case. Back in April, Gazprom had taken steps to block OMV from pursuing international arbitration by appealing to a Russian court.	https://kyivindependent.com/austrias-omv-secures-243-million-arbitral-award-for-gazproms-irregular-german-gas-supplies/	2024-11-14T21:47:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1251978952.jpg
Trump says Russia-Ukraine war 'gotta stop'	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a Mar-a-Lago event in Florida on Nov. 14 that his administration will focus on the Russia-Ukraine war. &quot;We&#x2019;re going to work very hard on Russia and Ukraine. It&#x2019;s gotta stop. Russia and Ukraine&#x2019;s gotta stop,&quot; Trump said at an event in Florida on Nov. 14, according to CNN. &quot;Whether they&#x2019;re soldiers or they&#x2019;re people sitting in towns, we&#x2019;re going to work it.&quot; Trump secured victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, adding further uncertainty for Ukraine regarding the future of Western military aid, and its defense against the ongoing Russian full-scale invasion. Earlier, Trump announced that he may &quot;soon&quot; appoint a Ukrainian peace envoy to lead negotiations on ending Russia&apos;s war, Fox News reported on Nov. 13. &quot;You&apos;re going to see a very senior special envoy, someone with a lot of credibility, who will be given a task to find a resolution, to get to a peace settlement,&quot; one of the sources said, adding that the appointment will happen &quot;in short order.&quot; Kurt Volker held a similar position and served as the U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine on a volunteer basis from 2017 to 2019. The post of Ukrainian peace envoy is also expected to be unpaid.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-says-russia-ukraine-war-gotta-stop/	2024-11-14T20:55:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183214747.jpg
France-trained brigade of Ukrainian soldiers prepares for deployment, Associated Press reports	A French military task force named &quot;Champagne&quot; is concluding its mission of training a newly formed brigade of several thousand Ukrainian troops. The brigade, armed with French-supplied tanks, artillery, and heavy weaponry, is preparing to enter the battledfield following two months of rigorous training across eastern and southern France, according to Associated Press. This deployment comes at a crucial moment as Russian forces continue pushing to gain control of the entire Donetsk Oblast, with support from up to 12,000 North Korean troops stationed in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk border region, according to intelligence from the U.S., South Korea, and Ukraine. French authorities have said the newly trained brigade &quot;Anne of Kyiv,&quot; named after a Kyiv princess who became a French queen, will be a significant force on the battlefield, eventually consisting of 4,500 troops. The brigade will include infantry battalions, engineers, artillery units, and other specialists. Currently, over 2,000 soldiers are wrapping up their final training in France. Most were recently mobilized and had only received basic training before arriving in France in September. Meanwhile, Ukrainian military trainers continue preparing additional troops for the brigade back home. The &quot;Champagne&quot; task force, comprising around 1,500 French soldiers, has focused on equipping the Ukrainian troops with tactical skills and expertise in operating French weaponry. The brigade&#x2019;s arsenal includes 18 AMX 10 light tanks, 18 Caesar truck-mounted artillery systems, 128 armored troop carriers, anti-tank and anti-aircraft missile systems, and other military gear. Reporters were not permitted to interview the Ukrainian soldiers, but French officers overseeing the training expressed confidence in their progress. &quot;They have improved a lot,&quot; a colonel identified by his first name only told Associated Press. &quot;Now they are able to fight, they are able to maneuver. They are able to use the different specialists and to use the different equipment they will have on the battlefield.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/france-trained-brigade-of-ukrainian-soldiers-prepares-for-deployment/	2024-11-14T19:52:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2158959416.jpg
London-based Russian anti-war chef found dead in Serbia, AFP reports	A renowned Russian chef known for his strong criticism of Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine was found dead during a visit to Serbia&apos;s capital. The death of Alexei Zimin, who has lived in London for years, is the latest in a series of deaths involving Russian expatriates critical of the war. A source close to the investigation told AFP that Zimin&apos;s body was discovered late on Nov. 12 in a rented apartment in Belgrade, where he was staying while promoting his latest book, &quot;Anglomania.&quot; Zimin co-founded the ZIMA restaurant in London, contributed as a senior writer for various magazines, and co-authored multiple books. Serbian authorities informed the BBC that there were &quot;no suspicious circumstances&quot; surrounding his death, and that both an autopsy and toxicology report were in progress. Born in Russia in 1971, Zimin established several restaurants in Moscow before departing after Russia&apos;s 2014 annexation of Crimea. Zimin&apos;s restaurant in London, Zima, confirmed the chef&apos;s death on Instagram. &quot;For us, Alexei was not only a colleague, he was our friend, a close person with whom we were lucky to go through a lot - both good, kind and sad,&quot; the restaurant said.	https://kyivindependent.com/london-based-russian-anti-war-chef-found-dead-in-serbia-afp-reports/	2024-11-14T17:35:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-617921162.jpg
Russia threatens to expel UN monitors from Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant	Russia&apos;s Foreign Ministry on Nov. 14 warned that it can expel International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors from the occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant if it finds their work &quot;inappropriate.&quot; The statement comes a day after the agency&apos;s director, Rafael Grossi, told the German news agency DPA that IAEA monitors would remain at the Zaporizhzhia plant until the war is &quot;frozen.&quot; &quot;We will continue to be there until the conflict comes to a new phase, at least less combat and maybe a ceasefire &#x2014; no, a frozen conflict, whatever phase we enter into, but without this looming threat,&quot; Grossi said. The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement in response warning that IAEA experts are allowed at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) &quot;only with the consent of the government of the Russian Federation.&quot; The nuclear monitors may only remain &quot;as long as our country considers their stay there to be justified,&quot; the ministry said. In their statement, Russia&apos;s Foreign Ministry lambasted Grossi for mentioning a possible cessation of hostilities. &quot;It is absolutely unclear on what basis the leadership of the IAEA undertakes to judge the prospects of the notorious &apos;freeze,&apos; which clearly goes beyond its powers,&quot; the ministry said. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest nuclear plant in Europe, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. Teams of IAEA monitors have been based at the plant on a rotating basis since September 2022. Russian authorities still deny inspectors full access to the plant. The ZNPP&apos;s position near the front lines has led to heightened nuclear safety risks throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-threatens-to-expel-un-monitors-from-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant/	2024-11-14T16:19:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1258719231.jpg
EU preparing more sanctions against Russia's shadow fleet, Bloomberg says	The European Union is preparing a new round of sanctions targeting Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; Bloomberg reported on Nov. 14, citing people familiar with the plans. Russia&apos;s shadow fleet is a group of older and often uninsured vessels used to ship out Russian oil while avoiding international sanctions imposed in 2022 as part of the effort to cut Moscow&apos;s fossil fuel revenue. EU member nations hope to approve the sanctions package by the end of the year, Bloomberg reported. The new restrictions would likely include penalties for individuals involved in the shadow fleet trade. The details of the package are still being negotiated, sources said, and the final version will require unanimous approval from all 27 member states. According to Bloomberg, some members hope the sanctions will include stronger measures against Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG). The EU, U.K., and U.S. have targeted Russia&apos;s shadow fleet in previous rounds of sanctions, applying restrictions to individual tankers and shipping services. The shadow fleet helps Russia successfully evade the West&apos;s attempts to stifle its oil profits via the $60-per-barrel price cap imposed two years ago. The Group of Seven (G7) unveiled the cap in late 2022, hoping to limit the revenues that feed Russia&apos;s war machine in Ukraine. According to a report from the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) Insititute published in October, Russia has invested $10 billion in expanding its shadow fleet since the price cap was imposed in 2022. If the EU is able to approve the new package by the end of the year, it could adopt the sanctions by the symbolic date of Feb. 24, 2025 &#x2014;&#xA0;the third anniversary of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-preparing-more-sanctions-against-russias-shadow-fleet-bloomberg-says/	2024-11-14T15:35:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1477537303.jpg
Germany orders port to reject Russian LNG deliveries	The German Economy Ministry instructed its state-operated gas import terminal to reject a delivery of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG), the Financial Times (FT) reported on Nov. 14. The order comes as European countries increasingly look to replace Russian energy imports and impose sanctions on Russian gas, including LNG. The ministry told the Deutsche Energy Terminal &quot;not to accept any deliveries of Russian LNG&quot; after receiving notice that the facility was expecting a shipment in the coming days. The port was instructed &quot;to reject LNG deliveries from Russia until further notice,&quot; according to a letter from the ministry viewed by FT. The German government built its own LNG import terminals to receive gas shipments by sea after Russian President Vladimir Putin cut pipeline gas supplies to EU countries following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Germany, once Europe&apos;s largest importer of Russian gas, hastened to find alternatives. The ministry&apos;s letter said the goal of the import terminal was to help make the country &quot;independent of Russian gas,&quot; and that it therefore could not accept the delivery. The German Economy Ministry told FT that &quot;in principle, it is correct that Germany does not import Russian gas and it is also clear to the (Economy Ministry) that this must not happen via German LNG terminals.&quot; While Germany no longer imports Russian LNG directly, the German state energy company SEFE has a long-term contract with Russia&apos;s Yamal facility. The supplies from Yamal are routed to France before being fed into the European pipeline system. The European Union imposed its first major restrictions on Russian gas, including LNG, in its 14th sanctions package in June. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen brought up the matter of Russian LNG in a phone conversation with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump shortly after his Nov. 5 victory. Von der Leyen said she floated the idea of replacing Russian LNG with more imports from the U.S. &quot;We still get a whole lot of LNG via Russia, from Russia,&quot; she said. &quot;And why not replace it with American LNG, which is cheaper, and brings down our energy prices?&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-orders-port-to-reject-russian-lng-deliveries/	2024-11-14T13:54:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2147892507.jpg
Russian mass drone strike on Odesa kills 1, injures at least 2	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia attacked the city of Odesa with drones late in the evening on Nov. 14, striking a residential buildings and killing one civilian. A &quot;massive&quot; Russian drone attack targeted Odesa and the surrounding region, Governor Oleh Kiper said. One woman was killed and at least two others were injured, Kiper reported. The attack damaged residential buildings, a church, and vehicles, causing fires to break out in some areas. The strike also damaged a main heating pipeline, forcing the city to shut down one of its boiler houses. Emergency services are at work at the sites of the attack, Kiper said. Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office, called the strike on Odesa a &quot;terrorist attack.&quot; &quot;(Russian President Vladimir) Putin just likes to fight civilians,&quot; he said. Russia has ramped up its drone attacks across Ukraine, including in major cities like Odesa and the capital, Kyiv, where civilians suffer drone attacks almost daily. Consecutive drone strikes targeted Odesa on Nov. 8 and 9, killing and injuring civilians.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-mass-drone-strike-on-odesa-kills-1-injures-at-least-2/	2024-11-14T13:16:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2169439959.jpg
We are exhausted' — how Ukrainians cope with nightly Russian drone attacks	Marharyta Koldanova was standing at a bus stop in a residential area in Kyiv when a sudden loud noise went off, prompting her to take out a tourniquet from her bag and prepare to quickly apply it in case she got injured by an aerial attack. &quot;I was overwhelmed with adrenaline and stress,&quot; Koldanova told the Kyiv Independent. The air raid alarm that usually alerts Ukrainians of a threat of a Russian drone or missile strike wasn&#x2019;t on. The sound she heard wasn&#x2019;t a weapon exploding but the noise coming from a local thermal power plant &#x2014; a regular buzz for a big city like Kyiv. Yet for Koldanova, whose daily life has been disrupted by Russian aerial attacks for 2.5 years, even a regular loud noise comes with an immediate sense of danger. Like thousands of other Ukrainians struggling with mental health issues due to the war, Koldanova has developed a hypersensitivity to sounds, anxiety, and insomnia. Since Russian strikes happen most often at night, they have been robbing millions of Ukrainians of proper sleep. To target cities far from the front line, Russia has been employing a combination of missiles and drones, often launched in large-scale coordinated attacks. However, in the past couple of months, Moscow&#x2019;s forces have changed tactics, launching barrages of drones nearly every night, and largely avoiding missiles. In October alone, over 2,000 drones attacked Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian military. These drone barrages aim to exhaust and locate the country&apos;s air defenses ahead of a larger campaign of strikes targeting Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure this winter, experts say. Though not as destructive as missiles and bombs, drone attacks often stretch on for many hours and can be launched far more frequently since drones are cheap and easy to produce. For long-range drone strikes, Russia&#x2019;s weapon of choice is the Iranian-designed Shahed, which can travel up to 2,500 kilometers, reaching any settlement in Ukraine. Since Moscow first employed Shaheds in October 2022, these killer drones have contributed to the deteriorating mental health of Ukrainians, and the destruction of critical infrastructure and homes, putting an additional burden on the Ukrainian military tasked with the defense of the Ukrainian skies. &quot;If I fall asleep before the air alarm, I often wake up to explosions, panicking and confused,&quot; Koldanova, a 32-year-old copywriter, told the Kyiv Independent, describing how her nights have been lately. &quot;If the alarm starts when I&apos;m awake, I can&apos;t go to sleep until the threat is over. I just sit and wait for the all-clear.&quot; Sometimes, this wait stretches until early morning. Living close to a Kyiv air defense site, Koldanova hears explosions close-by and sees flashes of the defense system firing at drones and missiles from her window. She&apos;s too afraid to spend 10 minutes to run to a nearby shelter, fearing debris could fall nearby and injure her, so she hides in her corridor with her dog, watching red flashes and listening attentively to every sound. &quot;Every time I hear an explosion, I think how close it was to me and whether (the next one) could hit my house.&quot; Running on just 3-4 hours of sleep, Koldanova finds it hard to concentrate at work the next day. Many Ukrainians struggle with low productivity, as experts say sleep deprivation hampers decision-making, memory, and performance. &quot;Sleep deprivation makes even minor dangers feel extreme, creating the feeling that danger is literally at every step and not letting you relax for a moment,&quot; explains Nika Bielska, a sleep consultant and geneticist. &quot;This makes it difficult to study, work, and just live your everyday life, strains family relationships, and heightens the risk of PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder).&quot; Ukrainian firefighters work to put out a fire in a high-rise residential building after being reportedly hit by a drone in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Oct. 25, 2024, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

(Serhii Chuzavkov / Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images)Already in fall 2022, over 70% of Ukrainian business leaders cited the deterioration of employee mental health as the main challenge for their companies. Fatigue and tension are now the dominant feelings for Ukrainians, according to a June 2024 survey by Gradus Research. Chronic sleep loss can lead to anxiety and depression and increase risks for physical health, including cancer and diabetes, says Volodymyr Voloshyn, a Ukrainian crisis psychologist and the head of the Institute of Health Psychology. He suggests Russia may be using sleep deprivation to make Ukrainians more vulnerable to manipulation and disinformation, important tools of modern warfare. Bielska adds that the longer sleep deprivation persists, the harder it becomes to relax, creating a &quot;vicious cycle&quot; of lack of sleep. Even when Kyiv gets a rare quiet night, free from Russian attacks, any loud noise can deprive local residents of sleep due to the developed hypersensitivity to sounds. &#x200B;&#x200B;&quot;When there&apos;s a thunderstorm and rain, I can&apos;t sleep,&quot; says Koldanova. &quot;I wake up panicking and check the news to make sure it was not an explosion.&quot; Overnight on Oct. 8, during yet another Russian drone attack against Ukraine, debris hit Kira Rodkina&#x2019;s residential building in Chornomorsk, a small southern city on the Black Sea coast. A fire engulfed one of the apartments where a family with children lived. Luckily, all of them survived the attack. Rodkina&apos;s apartment got off with broken windows and a burned ceiling. She had previously moved to Odesa when her husband joined the Ukrainian army in 2023, so she learned that her building had been hit by local news. &quot;(When I saw the photos), I felt rage, and I already said goodbye to it (the apartment) in my mind. I thought it was completely burned, and I would come and see the ashes,&quot; Rodkina, a 30-year-old volunteer who has been raising money for Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces since the start of the full-scale invasion, told the Kyiv Independent.

(Odesa Oblast Prosecutor&apos;s Office/Telegram)Since Russian troops started using Shahed drones against Ukraine in the autumn of 2022, Ukrainian forces have become skilled at shooting down the loitering munitions before they reach densely populated areas. Therefore, some Ukrainians have developed a perception of Shaheds as less dangerous weapons, often neglecting to go to the shelter amid drone attacks. However, kamikaze drones like Shaheds, while flying much slower than missiles, are still capable of causing serious damage to buildings and endangering civilians as they are estimated to weigh about 200 kilograms and carry around 45 kg of explosives, with upgraded Shaheds reportedly having twice as heavy warheads. A Russian drone strike against Kharkiv on Feb. 10, 2024, caused a fire that engulfed 15 homes and killed seven people, including a family with three children, as well as led to a fuel leak contaminating over 10,000 square meters of land.

(Tanya Dzafarowa/Suspilne Ukraine/JSC &quot;UA:PBC&quot;/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Since the beginning of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, over 50% of the housing stock &#x201C;in a significant number&#x201D; of Ukrainian cities and towns has been damaged or destroyed, the Kyiv School of Economics estimated in July. Drone attacks account for a fraction of the damage, but it&#x2019;s hard to calculate how many exactly. Rodkina was &quot;lucky&quot; &#x2014; nobody was at her home during the attack on Chornomorsk, and her apartment can be repaired &#x2014; but it&apos;s still painful for her to comprehend that her home came under attack. &quot;So many parties were held on that balcony, so many memories and warmth! So much life and emotions!&quot; Rodkina wrote on Instagram under the photo of her apartment building the day after the drone strike. &quot;But I can&apos;t say there was despair (following the attack). My husband had gone to war, his mother has cancer, and my father had been hospitalized after a heart attack,&quot; Rodkina says. &quot;These were very difficult times for the family. The apartment incident felt like, &apos;it can&#x2019;t get any worse.&apos;&quot; Rodkina&apos;s family is waiting for a special state commission to evaluate the damage done to their apartment so they can receive financial support from the state. She and her husband still plan to move back to their apartment in Chornomorsk after the war is over. While civilians take shelter, hoping their loved ones stay unharmed and their homes remain intact, Ukrainian service members work tirelessly to destroy Russian drones before they can cause any trouble. One of them is Dmytro from Ukraine&#x2019;s 117th Territorial Defense Brigade, who is identified in this article only by his first name due to security reasons. He commands three mobile air defense squads, who are based in the northeastern Sumy Oblast that borders Russia. Sumy Oblast faces swarms of drones nearly every night launched from across the Russian border. The Ukrainian military created these special units to quickly shoot down Russian drones using small arms and avoid depleting expensive interceptor missiles provided by Western allies. Dmytro says his 12-member team has downed 19 drones in the past three months, compared to only seven throughout 2023. Due to a dramatic increase in workload and shortage of personnel, Dmytro&#x2019;s team is currently on constant duty, with no rotations. They take turns resting so that at least one person from a group is watching the sky at any given moment to avoid missing a potential threat. Besides drones, Sumy Oblast is regularly targeted by bombs and missiles. &quot;We are exhausted, but we hold on&#x2026; If we leave, something will surely hit (the city), leaving people without heat, electricity, or water, and we cannot allow that,&quot; Dmytro says in a phone call with the Kyiv Independent.

(Zinchenko/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)In September, for the first time since the full-scale invasion, Russia launched drone attacks on cities and towns across Ukraine every day for an entire month. Russian troops used 1,334 drones that month, compared to 75 in March 2023, according to a recent report by Kyiv-based investment bank Dragon Capital. Meanwhile, the number of missiles launched by Russia was almost twice as low as in August, the report shows. In October, drone attacks intensified even more. Russia launched 2,023 Shaheds and other kinds of attack drones at civilian and military facilities in Ukraine, out of which 1,185 were intercepted, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces wrote on Nov. 1. Russia is now using 10 times more Shahed drones than last autumn, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 4. Ukrainian officials anticipated that Russia would begin a renewed campaign of large-scale missile strikes on the country&apos;s energy infrastructure with the onset of the heating season, which started mid-autumn. After a pause of more than two months, on the morning of Nov. 11, Ukrainians across the country received warnings of a mass missile attack, but it later turned out to be a Russian aviation training exercise. Russia&apos;s recent strategy of daily mass drone barrages may be aimed at depleting Ukraine&apos;s air defense systems ahead of an intensified missile campaign, according to experts interviewed by the Kyiv Independent last month. Sidharth Kaushal, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), suggested that this tactic could also force Ukraine to expose its air defense network when intercepting drones. As Ukrainians across the country are bracing for mass missile attacks in the near future, Dmytro&#x2019;s team keeps spending their nights in the field hunting for Russian drones. Their primary motivation is protecting native Sumy, where their families live. However, the soldiers urgently need more trained and highly motivated personnel and additional weapons to keep up with the escalating workload. &quot;It hasn&apos;t become easier, it&apos;s only getting harder. Russians won&apos;t go anywhere,&quot; Dmytro concludes. &quot;We can&apos;t just hope this will end on its own. We need to destroy them (the Russian troops), and only then will it end.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/we-are-exhausted-how-ukrainians-cope-with-nightly-russian-drone-attacks/	2024-11-14T13:04:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2180281680-1.jpg
Kremlin finds new enemies to target — Russians without kids	More than a decade since Russian lawmakers banned &quot;LGBTQ+ propaganda,&quot; the Kremlin&apos;s self-declared crusade for &quot;traditional values&quot; has found a new target &#x2014; Russians who don&apos;t want children. On Nov. 12, the Russian State Duma voted to criminalize the support and promotion of &quot;childfree propaganda,&quot; effectively imposing fines on those who publicly express such views. Once approved by the upper house of the country&apos;s parliament and signed into force by Russian President Vladimir Putin, individuals can be fined around $4,000; state officials will see a $8,000 fine, while the fine for businesses can hit up to around $50,000 and get the company&apos;s license revoked for 90 days. Being vague in its interpretation, the legislation could be used to target advertising or selling of contraceptives and further restrict abortion rights. A last minute exception was made in the law for those who have chosen to remain celebate for religious reasons, such as monks, at the request of the Russian Orthodox Church. The term &quot;childfree&quot; describes adults who have consciously decided not to have children, rather than those who may not be able to give birth. While it first hit the feminist mainstream in the 1970s, interest in the term has grown in recent years as more young women discuss their own complex decisions on child-rearing online. That, according to Russian officials, is a threat &#x2014; both to Russia&apos;s social fabric and its already plummeting birth rate. In June 2024, Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Irina Yarovaya equated being childfree with a weapon &quot;aimed at Russia&apos;s younger generations.&quot; &quot;When we talk about protecting life, law enforcement officers know what to do. If you have a person with a weapon in their hands, they act as decisively as possible,&quot; she told visitors at the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum. &quot;So how should we act here when we are also dealing with weapons that are aimed at younger generations?&quot; On the surface, the law may seem superfluous. There is no wave of childfree activism in Russia and no organizations advocating for the rights of adults without children. The law is also unlikely to affect Russia&apos;s sluggish demographics: couples who wish to have children often have more pressing concerns, such as the country&apos;s uncertain economic and political scene. &quot;The law is striking in the sense that it seems so completely unnecessary; it seems like a response to something that doesn&apos;t really exist,&quot; says Dr. Valerie Sperling, professor of political science at Clark University in Massachusetts. &quot;For people who want to have children, it&apos;s not like a post from someone who says they don&apos;t want to have kids, or even a post saying that other people shouldn&apos;t have kids, is going to change their mind.&quot; But such laws do have benefits for the Russian government &#x2014; both at home and on the global stage. Russia&apos;s declining birth rate has been a key concern for the Kremlin since the 2000s. In many ways, the move to ban &quot;childfree propaganda&quot; is the latest in the long line of pro-natalist policies, which range from the practical &#x2014; such as providing cash payments to families following their children&apos;s birth &#x2014; to the repressive, such as limiting abortion rights. Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, however, has sent this long-standing policy into overdrive. State messaging on the importance of childbearing has become increasingly aggressive in recent years, says Sperling. In a speech to mark Women&apos;s Day in March 2024, Putin described motherhood as women&apos;s greatest gift and a &quot;glorious mission.&quot; A year prior, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Putin and Russian Presidential Commissioner for Children&apos;s Rights Maria Lvova-Belova, over the deportation of Ukrainian children from Russian occupiead parts of the country. Putin previously praised Lvova-Belova for her work overseeing the deportation of Ukrainian children, portraying it as a so-called &quot;humanitarian effort&quot; to &quot;protect Russian citizens.&quot; Lvova-Belova claimed that 700,000 Ukrainian children have been brought to Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion. One factor of the Russian state now going against the local population unwilling to have children is rooted in how society&apos;s image of patriotism meets with gender roles. If men are pushed to show national pride during wartime by enlisting, women are similarly expected to show their devotion by raising children loyal to the state. &quot;The reason that pro-natalism is highlighted during wartime is because women&apos;s status as mothers is what lends them their patriotism. Women are supposed to be dedicated to the cause by raising future soldiers and supporting whatever wars the state engages in,&quot; Sperling says. But it also reflects how Russian society has become increasingly repressive. Pro-natalist laws can also be used to punish or pressure those who do not conform to the state&apos;s narrow vision of what a family should be. Russian lawyers have already raised concerns that the &quot;childfree propaganda&quot; bill is vaguely worded and could be interpreted to stifle conversations on anything from abortion to birth control. It could also become an additional legal tool for the Russian security services to punish those who stand against Moscow&apos;s invasion of Ukraine &#x2014; particularly feminist activists who have become a key part of Russia&apos;s small anti-war resistance. &quot;Targeting feminists is one of the presidential administration&apos;s main goals, as they know that women&apos;s protests are currently the strongest and most powerful force within the country,&quot; says feminist activist Ira Heuvelman. On a practical level, she worries that the law will impede sex education for teenagers, resulting in a rise in unwanted pregnancies and illegal abortions. But she also believes that the law could be used to target any woman without children who is involved in opposition activity. &quot;Pregnant women or those with children are less likely to have the power to resist (the government), given the many economic and social pressures they face,&quot; she says. &quot;They will likely find some high-profile cases and imprison individuals to scare others. Even though &quot;child-free propaganda&quot; only exists in the minds of the presidential administration, they will manage to fabricate cases and bring them to trial, making the process as public as possible.&quot; Such laws, however, are not purely domestic tools. As with the ongoing persecution of the LGBTQ+, legislating against &quot;childfree propaganda&quot; is being marketed by the Kremlin as part of a global struggle for socially conservative values. When discussing the law at the end of September, Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of Russia&apos;s lower house of parliament, told journalists that childfree ideology was being promoted by the United States. &quot;Our country is vast and their (U.S.) ideology is dangerous. Under no circumstances should it be allowed to spread,&quot; he said. For the Kremlin, the image of Moscow as a conservative bastion against a degenerating &quot;liberal West&quot; is a vital soft power tool, says Dr. Jenny Mathers, senior lecturer in the International Politics Department at the University of Aberystwyth. It portrays Russia as an ally of countries and leaders that share similarly conservative, often oppressive social tastes. &quot;There are some key countries, especially in the global south, where this message of &apos;traditional values&apos; really seems to resonate,&quot; says Mathers. &quot;It serves a foreign policy purpose. It&apos;s one way of creating a more positive image of Russia in the wider world, at least for some.&quot; Socially conservative rhetoric and policies have helped Russia find common ground with countries with whom it may otherwise have little in common. These emotive topics can also be used to stress resentment towards the West. &quot;They tap into the shared sense of yes, we too are feeling oppressed by the West and their demands that we should give rights to LGBTQ+ people and so on,&quot; says Mathers. &quot;It makes some communities in the international arena more sympathetic towards Russia, more willing to listen to what Russia has to say.&quot; Once they have that sympathetic ear, Moscow can also use that opening to gain support for its own goals. The conservative rhetoric to which the &quot;childfree propaganda&quot; bill belongs does not just provide an identity for Russia on the global stage &#x2014; it is also a platform that can be used and twisted to justify the country&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. Russian officials have repeatedly spoken of the need to &quot;save&quot; Ukraine from liberal Western values by bringing it back under Russian control. When Putin announced the start of the full-scale invasion in a televised address on Feb. 24, 2022, he decried a West that &quot;sought to destroy our traditional values and force on us their false values &#x2026; attitudes that are directly leading to degradation and degeneration, because they are contrary to human nature.&quot; Days later, the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, insinuated to worshippers that Russia was protecting Ukraine&apos;s Donbas region, consisting of partly occupied Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, from Western governments angry that the region did not want to hold a pride parade. &quot;It&apos;s this idea of Western deviance versus Russian purity and morality,&quot; says Sperling. &quot;The implication is that Russia was obliged to invade Ukraine to prevent the irrational, immoral, perverse Western incursions on Russia that would take place if Ukraine remained an independent state. That is where it all ties together.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-finds-new-enemy-to-target-russians-without-kids/	2024-11-14T12:55:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182199374.jpg
EU pushing Biden for last-minute measures to support Ukraine, Bloomberg reports	European leaders are appealing to outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden in a last-minute effort to secure support for Ukraine before President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s inauguration, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 14, citing people familiar with the plans. Trump, who has opposed ongoing U.S. aid to Ukraine and pushed for a speedy deal with Moscow to end the war, will take office on Jan. 20, 2025. Some EU officials are urging the U.S. to provide more weapons and artillery to Ukraine, as well as permissions to carry out long-range strikes on Russia, sources told Bloomberg. There have also been requests for additional sanctions against Moscow. Many of the requests have been informal, sources said. The Biden administration has assured Ukraine that it will receive the full $6 billion in remaining congressionally-allotted aid before Trump returns to the White House in January. In an emergency visit to NATO headquarters in Brussels after the U.S. election, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the administration is also looking for additional assistance for Ukraine ahead of the presidential transition. Biden will &quot;continue to shore up everything we&apos;re doing for Ukraine&quot; to ensure it can either fight effectively next year or negotiate peace with Russia from a position of strength, Blinken said. Despite these assurances, the U.S. has not changed its position on Ukraine&apos;s use of long-range American weapons against military targets deep within Russia. Such permission was a key part of the five-point victory plan President Volodymyr Zelensky presented to Western leaders. &quot;When we engage with our American friends and partners, I really hope we&apos;ll continue our support to Ukrainians, including on deep strikes, to use legitimate defense when targets are used to strike Ukraine&apos;s defense and infrastructure,&quot; France&apos;s European Affairs Minister Benjamin Haddad told Bloomberg in an interview. With Washington&apos;s continued military support for Kyiv now uncertain, Europe has become Ukraine&apos;s main defense partner in the war against Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-pushing-biden-for-last-minute-measures-to-support-ukraine-bloomberg-reports/	2024-11-14T12:45:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-643099758.jpg
Ukraine's 'internal resilience plan' to be presented next week, Zelensky says	Ukraine is developing a 10-point &quot;internal resilience plan&quot; that will be presented next week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Nov. 14. In late October, Zelensky instructed the National Security and Defense Council to prepare a plan to strengthen Ukraine, covering the front line, the military-industrial complex, economy and finance, regional development, and other strategic sectors. The government&apos;s latest plan will focus on internal solutions and is not an alternative to a victory plan oriented toward Kyiv&apos;s partners. &quot;There are 10 points in total, which will be presented next week, and for each point, together with Ukrainian civil society, together with everyone who is ready to add rational ideas, with business, we will prepare a basic, doctrinal document for Ukraine, for our sustainability,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;With clear applications. Step by step.&quot; The Ukrainian government on Nov. 14 focused on drafting a plan for internal plan security that would include every community in the country, according to Zelensky. &quot;The Interior Ministry and the Security Service of Ukraine have good practices. We will implement everything,&quot; he said. &quot;We have already worked out points, in particular, on energy &#x2014; everything is prepared in detail &#x2014; and on weapons: our production, our cooperation with partners.&quot; The government has also developed a clause on cultural sovereignty, Ukraine&apos;s cultural heritage, cultural diplomacy, and the production of Ukrainian content. &quot;There are things that neither politicians, nor public figures, nor the information space can convey to others. But emotions do it, art does it,&quot; Zelensky said. Facing Russian military advances and increasingly uncertain Western support, Zelensky previously pitched to Ukraine and its allies a five-step victory plan, containing steps that should supposedly end the war by 2025. Some points of the plan met with a lukewarm response from partners, with the White House still refusing to permit long-range strikes on Russian territory and several countries resisting a NATO invitation for Ukraine.The New York Times reported on Oct. 29 that, according to undisclosed U.S. officials, the request for Tomahawk missiles with a range of 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) was part of the secretive &quot;non-nuclear deterrence package&quot; included in Ukraine&apos;s victory plan.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-internal-resilience-plan-to-be-presented-next-week-zelensky-says/	2024-11-14T12:09:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178140389.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine repels Russian attempt to enter Kupiansk, military says	Key developments on Nov. 14: Ukrainian forces successfully repelled Russian attempts to break into the city of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukrinfrom reported on Nov. 14, citing the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. &quot;All Russian attacks in this direction were successfully repelled. Russian invaders failed to enter Kupiansk. The city is under the control of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces,&quot; General Staff spokesperson Andrii Kovalev told Ukrinform. The statement came after the crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState had claimed late on Nov. 13 that some Russian units, including armored vehicles and a tank, managed to enter Kupiansk but soon suffered heavy losses. An estimated Russian advance (red) near Kupiansk as of Nov. 13, 2024, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Kupiansk is a key logistics and railway hub in the eastern part of Kharkiv Oblast. With several highways and five railway lines running through it, the town was briefly occupied by Russian forces before it was liberated during a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive in the autumn of 2022. According to Kovalev, Russian forces attempted to break through Ukrainian defenses in the area at around 2:30 p.m. local time on Nov. 13, attacking in four waves. They employed 15 vehicles, including tanks and armored fighting vehicles. The spokesperson said that Russian troops wore Ukrainian uniforms, which violates international rules of warfare. Ukrainian defenders destroyed &quot;all Russian armored vehicles&quot; and a &quot;significant part of manpower,&quot; he added. Russian troops ramped up their efforts near Kupiansk in early September and are now only 2 3 kilometers from the city&apos;s industrial outskirts in the northeast. Moscow&apos;s forces are attempting to find a footing for a final push to reach the Oskil River, dividing the city into two, before winter sets in. During his evening address, President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the soldiers defending the front line and spoke of Russia&apos;s &quot;attempts to expand their offensive, especially in the Kupiansk direction.&quot; &quot;I am grateful to all our units for their resilience,&quot; he said. Even if Russian units have not yet entered the town, regular shelling of the city creates increasingly hard conditions for the locals to continue with their lives, with no gas, water, or electricity in the city&apos;s eastern bank. Capturing the city would widen the north-to-south supply route from Russia&apos;s Belgorod Oblast, fuelling their attempt to take the entire Donbas region. The Defense Ministry plans to finalize a bill defining the procedure and conditions for discharging military personnel from service by Dec. 18 this year, secretary of the parliamentary defense committee Roman Kostenko told Ukrainska Pravda on Nov. 14. Due to the lack of a regulatory framework, Ukrainian military personnel cannot be demobilized at will, even after long service. The reasons for demobilization may include injury or the need to care for a family member with a disability. Many Ukrainian soldiers have been serving non-stop since the first day of the full-scale invasion in late February 2022. &quot;The committee addressed the Defense Ministry with an official request to develop a draft law on the procedure and conditions for the dismissal of certain categories of military personnel during martial law,&quot; Kostenko said. &quot;Recently, we received a response saying that, according to the ministry&apos;s plan, the draft will be ready by Dec. 18, 2024, within the timeframe set by the parliament.&quot; It is not yet clear what conditions the Defense Ministry will propose for discharging military personnel from service, Kostenko added. Ukraine&apos;s parliament adopted an updated mobilization law in mid-April to ramp up mobilization amid Russia&apos;s ongoing war. The new law simplifies the process for identifying eligible conscripts and includes additional penalties for those dodging the draft. The parliament voted to remove provisions on demobilization, which previously foresaw soldiers having the right to leave the military after 36 months of service, from the bill so that they could be considered separately. The parliament obliged the Defense Ministry to develop a relevant draft law within eight months. Kyiv&apos;s European partners are increasingly preparing for a deal that could include Ukraine giving up on some of its territories in return for security guarantees, the Washington Post reported on Nov. 13, citing interviews with 10 current and former Western officials. The news comes amid Ukraine&apos;s mounting setbacks on the battlefield and uncertainties about U.S. support under incoming President Donald Trump. The U.S. president-elect has pledged to end the war &quot;within 24 hours,&quot; sparking concerns he might push Ukraine toward painful concessions. While publicly declaring full support for Ukraine, the idea of ceding territory is quietly gaining more traction among Western officials, even though the details of such an agreement remain unclear, the Washington Post wrote. &quot;I think everybody has more or less reached this conclusion. It&apos;s hard to say it publicly because it would be a way of saying we are going to reward aggression,&quot; Gerard Araud, a former French ambassador to the U.S., told the news outlet. The proposal is being allegedly reframed from &quot;land-for-peace&quot; to &quot;security-for-peace&quot; to stress the necessity for security guarantees that would prevent further Russian aggression. Russia currently occupies roughly one-fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory in the south and the east. Kyiv has repeatedly said that entry to NATO is the most secure way to avert future wars, but the proposal has met cold responses from a number of allies. Quick accession seems even more unlikely now as one proposal from Trump&apos;s team reportedly includes delaying Ukraine&apos;s entry by at least 20 years and instead supplying it with sufficient arms to repel Russia on its own. Ukraine and Russia held unsuccessful negotiations in early 2022. The initial version of Russia&apos;s peace proposal issued shortly after the start of the full-scale invasion and leaked to the media this year was described as an effective surrender of Ukraine. The terms became more moderate later on and included reducing Ukraine&apos;s military size, prohibiting NATO entry but allowing EU accession, and postponing the matter of occupied territories to a later date. The treaty would be backed by international guarantors like the U.K., the U.S., China, and France. The negotiations eventually failed, and no direct talks have been held between Ukraine and Russia since then. Kyiv has insisted that a peace settlement should be based on President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s 10-point peace formula, which includes the restoration of full territorial integrity. Some Ukrainian officials acknowledged, however, that some territory would have to be liberated by diplomatic means as the country&apos;s manpower and resources dwindle in the face of unrelenting Russian attacks. There seems to be little readiness for compromise in Moscow as its forces continue steadily advancing in Donetsk Oblast. Russia&apos;s economy has largely weathered Western sanctions and managed to offset its heavy battlefield casualties better than Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in October that his country is not planning any concessions and that a peace deal must favor Moscow. Donald Trump&apos;s pick for the U.N. envoy, Elise Stefanik, dodged questions on her earlier support for Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession and on calling Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine &quot;genocidal,&quot; with her office saying her views now fully align with Trump&apos;s, CNN reported on Nov. 13. Shortly after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in 2022, the Republican Congresswoman said that Ukraine needs &quot;to be admitted into NATO and we need to do everything we can by providing them munitions and Javelins,&quot; reminding that the weaponry was first provided under the first Trump administration. When asked about the matter again by CNN after Trump tapped her for the U.N. job, Stefanik&apos;s office said the Congresswoman&apos;s views fully align with those of the president-elect, without going into details. &quot;Chairwoman Stefanik fully supports President Trump&apos;s peace through strength policy agenda and will follow his lead as Commander in Chief on best practices to end the war in Ukraine,&quot; her communications director, Ali Black, was quoted as saying by CNN. Stefanik was among the 400 members of the U.S. House of Representatives who were sanctioned by Russia, calling the sanctions a &quot;badge of honor&quot; at the time. As public opinion in the U.S. regarding aid to Ukraine shifted and some Republicans became increasingly vocal in their opposition, she also voted against the $60 billion aid package that eventually passed in April 2024. After Trump&apos;s victory in the presidential election on Nov. 5, she was appointed to lead U.S. representation at the United Nations. &quot;Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America first fighter,&quot; President-elect Trump said. Trump&apos;s support for Ukraine hangs in the air as analysts and politicians try to gauge his plans to bring peace, as he promised to end the war within &quot;24 hours&quot; after reelection without revealing details. Predictions range from Trump keeping his word and ending the war as soon as possible in a &quot;land-for-peace&quot; scheme to more optimistic views that the incoming president would not leave Ukraine behind after so much American taxpayer money was spent on its security.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-repels-russian-attempt-to-enter-kupiansk-military-says/	2024-11-14T12:08:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166158560.jpg
Construction of 2 new power units underway at South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant	Preparations for the construction of two power units based on U.S. company Westinghouse&apos;s AR1000 technology are underway at the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant, according to the plant&apos;s Nov. 13 statement. The South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant, the second largest of the country&apos;s five nuclear power stations, is located near the city of Pivdennoukrainsk in Mykolaiv Oblast. Ukraine relies on nuclear power for more than half of its energy production, which is increasingly in demand amid Russia&apos;s attacks on Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure. The nuclear power plant currently has three operating power units with a total capacity of 3,000 megawatts (MW). Geological studies were conducted to construct the new power units, and a construction site was selected, the statement read. Ukraine is also preparing to resume the construction of the previously abandoned Chyhyryn plant in Cherkasy Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s state nuclear energy operator said on Aug. 27. According to Energoatom, the plant will also be equipped with AP1000 reactors built by the U.S. company Westinghouse. The members of the Chyhyryn City Council voted to permit Energoatom to resume the plant&apos;s construction. &quot;The first steps have been taken,&quot; said Energoatom. Meanwhile, Ukraine&apos;s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe&apos;s largest nuclear power station, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. Its position near the front line has led to heightened nuclear safety risks throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Ukraine&apos;s National Resistance Center reported on Sept. 15 that Russian forces continued to use the territory of the occupied power plant to deploy military personnel and store ammunition and explosives.	https://kyivindependent.com/construction-of-2-new-power-units-underway-at-south-ukraine-nuclear-power-plant/	2024-11-14T11:54:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1583751598.jpg
European Commission approves $4.3 billion for Ukraine under Ukraine Facility program	The European Commission agreed to allocate 4.1 billion euros ($4.3 billion) to Ukraine under the Ukraine Facility program, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen confirmed on Nov. 14. The decision must be approved by the EU Council before the transfer. &quot;As we&apos;re approaching the 1000th day of Russia&apos;s atrocious war, we will help keep the Ukrainian state running while the country fights for survival. We are in it for the long haul,&quot; Von der Leyen said. The EU greenlighted the Ukraine Facility in February, and the EU Council approved the framework agreement in mid-May, setting out the Ukrainian government&apos;s tasks for recovery, reconstruction, and modernization. The European Commission also praised Ukraine&apos;s recent reforms, which allowed it to receive the latest financial tranche, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said. &quot;We expect the EU Council to approve the decision as soon as possible. After that, the total amount of support under the Ukraine Facility for this year will amount to 16.1 billion euros ($17 billion),&quot; Shmyhal added. In mid-August, Ukraine received 4.2 billion euros ($4.6 billion) as part of the EU&apos;s four-year financial support program. Kyiv also received several pre-financing &quot;bridge&quot; tranches under the assistance plan earlier this year. Ukraine was provided with $42.5 billion in external financing from various donors last year, allowing it to function amid the ongoing war. The International Monetary Fund said Ukraine will need roughly the same sum to support its budget this year. According to Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko, the current pledges are still not sufficient to cover the country&apos;s needs, adding that Ukraine will likely need an additional $12-15 billion in foreign financial support next year.	https://kyivindependent.com/european-commission-approves-4-3-billion-for-ukraine-under-ukraine-facility-program/	2024-11-14T10:50:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2157219393.jpg
Chinese oil refinery buys West African crude instead of Russian, Iranian, Bloomberg reports	Private Chinese oil refinery Landbridge Petrochemical Co. has made a rare purchase of a shipment of West African oil instead of typical import from sanctioned Iran and Russia, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 14. The Russian fossil fuel industry is a primary economic driver of Moscow&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Ukraine has made a concerted effort to target Russian oil production with long-range drone strikes. Landbridge Petrochemical Co. purchased the oil at a time when the global oil market is preparing for possible revisions to the U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil in the wake of Donald Trump&apos;s election to office. Global banks suggest that the approach to sanctions could be stricter, Bloomberg reported. The refinery&apos;s move reportedly sparked interest among traders, as small independent refineries in China typically import crude oil from sanctioned Iran and Russia. Landbridge Petrochemical Co., which recently resumed operations after a long shutdown, bought 2 million barrels, including the Mostarda variety, for delivery in January, Bloomberg reported, citing traders. Refineries like Landbridge Petrochemical Co., the so-called teapots, have mostly bought Russian ESPO and Iranian crude because they are generally cheaper and have shorter delivery routes. Yet, conditions are changing, making other flows more attractive, according to traders. Apart from that, the limited supply of spot Iranian oil &#x2014; given fears of a possible Israeli strike on Tehran&apos;s energy infrastructure &#x2014; is prompting market players to look for oil sources in other countries. Light Iranian crude was offered to Chinese refiners at a $2 per barrel discount to ICE Brent, down from $3.50 a month ago, traders said. Oil from eastern Russia from the ESPO pipeline for January loading was offered at a premium of up to $1.80 per barrel, up 50 cents from a month ago.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinese-oil-refinery-buys-west-african-crude-instead-of-russian-iranian-bloomberg-reports/	2024-11-14T09:57:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1258888534.jpg
Defense Ministry pledges to draft bill on demobilization by Dec. 18, official says	The Defense Ministry plans to finalize a bill defining the procedure and conditions for discharging military personnel from service by Dec. 18 this year, secretary of the parliamentary defense committee Roman Kostenko told Ukrainska Pravda on Nov. 14. Due to the lack of a regulatory framework, Ukrainian military personnel cannot be demobilized at will, even after long service. The reasons for demobilization may include injury or the need to care for a family member with a disability. Many Ukrainian soldiers have been serving non-stop since the first day of the full-scale invasion in late February 2022. &quot;The committee addressed the Defense Ministry with an official request to develop a draft law on the procedure and conditions for the dismissal of certain categories of military personnel during martial law,&quot; Kostenko said. &quot;Recently, we received a response saying that, according to the ministry&apos;s plan, the draft will be ready by Dec. 18, 2024, within the timeframe set by the parliament.&quot; It is not yet clear what conditions the Defense Ministry will propose for discharging military personnel from service, Kostenko added. Ukraine&apos;s parliament adopted an updated mobilization law in mid-April to ramp up mobilization amid Russia&apos;s ongoing war. The new law simplifies the process for identifying eligible conscripts and includes additional penalties for those dodging the draft. The parliament voted to remove provisions on demobilization, which previously foresaw soldiers having the right to leave the military after 36 months of service, from the bill so that they could be considered separately. The parliament obliged the Defense Ministry to develop a relevant draft law within eight months.	https://kyivindependent.com/defense-ministry-pledges-to-draft-bill-on-demobilization-by-dec-18-official-says/	2024-11-14T09:27:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2163893481.jpg
Hegseth's nomination for defense secretary 'shocks' Pentagon officials, Politico reports	Pentagon officials are &quot;shocked&quot; and &quot;alarmed&quot; by President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s decision to nominate Fox News anchor and veteran Pete Hegseth as U.S. defense secretary, Politico reported on Nov. 13. Trump named Hegseth the incoming U.S. defense secretary on Nov. 12. If approved by Congress, Hegseth will replace current Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin following Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20. Hegseth would lead 1.3 million troops and over 750,000 civilians, hold meetings with U.S. allies, and develop options for strikes against the Islamic State and Iranian proxies, according to Politico. The Pentagon is concerned that while Hegseth has military experience, he has never run a large organization, Politico reported, citing six undisclosed current and former Pentagon officials. &quot;Would you trust him to run Walmart?&quot; said a former Defense Department official. &quot;Because that&apos;s how many employees we have.&quot; &quot;Folks are shocked,&quot; said a current Defense Department official. &quot;He&apos;s just a Fox News personality that&#x2019;s never worked in the government.&quot; The sources, who spoke to Politico on condition of anonymity, doubt that Hegseth will be able to manage &quot;a complex bureaucratic system&quot; like the Pentagon. &quot;It&apos;s a deadly serious job, and this strikes me as a mainly performative person who is best known for talking about wokeness and not doing anything meaningful on national security post serving in the military,&quot; said another Defense Department official. &quot;It is a massive bureaucracy, you have to understand how that works to support national security around the globe,&quot; the official added. &quot;It is tedious and challenging, and it is not at all related to getting on Fox News and pontificating.&quot; According to current and former officials, the appointment of Hegseth could &quot;scare off&quot; candidates for over 80 other positions in the department that the Senate approves. Several foreign diplomats told the media they rushed to order Hegseth&apos;s latest book online after his nomination, as allies tried to get to know a man &quot;they had never heard of and had no idea what his priorities might be.&quot; Hegseth, 44, previously served as an infantry captain in the Army National Guard, doing multiple tours of Afghanistan and Iraq. Hegseth is the former head of the conservative organization Concerned Veterans for America and, in June 2024, released a book titled &quot;The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.&quot; Hegseth also unsuccessfully ran as a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Minnesota in 2012. Up until Nov. 12, Hegseth co-hosted Fox &amp; Friends Weekend, a morning news and talk show that Trump would call into regularly. Hegseth has also appeared as a regular contributor to the Fox News Channel, a U.S. network with a strong conservative bent.	https://kyivindependent.com/hegseths-nomination-for-defense-secretary-shocks-pentagon-officials-politico-says/	2024-11-14T08:48:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/gettyimages-1167012751-612x612.jpg
Ukraine needs ‘fast and focused’ help with energy security, ERBD Ukraine head says	Arvid Tuerkner&#x2019;s first winter in charge of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Ukraine comes with a daunting task: swiftly mobilize investment into energy companies crippled by two years of Russian attacks. Russia began targeting Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure in late 2022 and has since then pounded the energy system with drones and missiles, knocking out half of the country&#x2019;s power generation capacity by late 2024. Officials have warned this winter could be the worst yet since Russia began its campaign against the energy system. The EBRD has plowed nearly a quarter of its $4.5 billion in investments into the country&#x2019;s state-owned energy companies since late 2022. Back then, the London-based lender focused on financing repairs and defensive structures. It&#x2019;s now supporting electricity generation after attacks earlier this year decimated Ukraine&#x2019;s thermal and hydroelectric plants. &#x201C;We need to be very fast and focused to make sure (energy generation) is online as soon as possible,&#x201D; Tuerkner, who also heads the bank&apos;s efforts in Moldova, told the Kyiv Independent at the end of a two-week visit to Ukraine on Oct. 31. The bank &#x2014; Kyiv&#x2019;s largest institutional lender &#x2014; has been a lifeline for Ukrainian private and state companies, agreeing to a 4-billion-euro capital increase in December 2023 to allow it to double its lending to the war-torn nation. So far this year, it has injected more than 1.3 billion euros across 46 projects, backing schemes in energy and food security, trade, and vital infrastructure, with a focus on private sector resilience. Tuerkner says that given the current situation, however, energy has been the priority since his appointment five months ago.

(Genya Savilov/AFP via Getty Images)Electricity transmission system operator Ukrenergo, oil and gas giant Naftogaz, and hydropower company Hyrdoenergo have received the lion&#x2019;s share of the bank&apos;s investments, receiving at least 1 billion euros ($1.053 billion) since 2022. Naftogaz told the Kyiv Independent the bank is a &#x201C;steadfast and invaluable partner&#x201D; that is &#x201C;instrumental&#x201D; in Ukraine&#x2019;s energy security. The state-owned company has received EBRD loans totaling 500 million euros ($527 million) since the start of the full-scale invasion. Energy rationing necessary to mitigate the impact of Russian attacks is expected to leave Ukrainians without power for large parts of the day. Executive Director of DTEK &#x2014; Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy company that the EBRD has so far stayed away from due to its ownership by Ukrainian billionaire Rinat Akhmetov &#x2014; told the Kyiv Independent in June that in a worst-case scenario, Ukrainians could face up to 20 hours of blackouts a day. The country has moved to decentralize its energy system as quickly as possible by replacing some of the power generated by coal-powered thermal plants destroyed or heavily damaged by Russia with gas-powered turbines, solar panels, and &#x201C;mini thermal plants,&#x201D; among other quick solutions. To bolster government efforts, the bank has extended loans for equipment like generators through a 700-million-euro shared risk program. While the EBRD is working with Europe&#x2019;s green energy transition to move away from fossil fuels, Ukraine&#x2019;s urgent energy needs take priority, Tuerkner said. The bank asked shareholders for an exemption for Ukraine&#x2019;s gas generation construction. Tuerkner believes short-term solutions, like gas engines, will help balance power for intermittent renewables in the long run. The EBRD is continuing to invest in Ukraine&#x2019;s clean energy sector this year to support the transition, including a 62-million-euro loan to the fuel-retail company Galnaftogaz for a 147-megawatt (MW) wind farm. The bank is additionally financing new players entering the energy generation market, such as state railway operator Ukrzaliznytsia, which announced plans in June to build dozens of gas-generating plants with a total capacity of up to 250 MW across the country. &#xA0;Ukrnafta, a state-owned oil and gas extraction company that is a subsidiary of Naftogaz, is also constructing gas-burning electricity and heat generation facilities covering 70 MW with support from the EBRD. &#xA0;The Ukrnafta and Ukrzaliznytsia projects won&#x2019;t be up and running until 2025, Tuerkner said. &#x201C;The (energy) situation will not be so different in six months&apos; time. It&apos;s still very much needed because there is a gap in generation,&#x201D; he said. In addition to a ticking clock as winter settles in, the largest wartime government reshuffle in September has disrupted EBRD projects with the public sector, according to Tuerkner. With ministers being fired and hired, including the sacking of Ukrenergo CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, decision-making has been slow but is still on a &#x201C;good track,&#x201D; he said.

(Yevhenii Vasyliev/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Private-sector support Despite breaking with the EBRD&#x2019;s long-standing mandating of focusing primarily on the private sector by investing in Ukraine&#x2019;s state-owned companies, the bank has also been one of the few investors to continue backing big-ticket investments. In the largest foreign direct investment since the start of the full-scale invasion, the EBRD provided a $435 million loan alongside the International Finance Corporation for a $600 million merger. &#xA0;French billionaire Xavier Niel&#x2019;s company NJJ Capital purchased Ukraine&#x2019;s third-largest mobile operator Lifecell and service provider Datagroup-Volia earlier this year, merging the companies under a new entity, Lifecell-Datagroup-Volia.&#x201C;That (investment) shows everything is possible,&#x201D; Tuerkner said. Kyiv-based private equity firm Horizon Capital, an equity partner on the NJJ capital merger, told the Kyiv Independent that the EBRD &#x201C;serves as a powerful anchor to private investors&#x201D; as the bank looks to encourage more money into Ukraine. Attracting investment has been lackluster as Russia&#x2019;s war rages into its third year. Tuerkner doesn&#x2019;t expect a lot of investment during the war &#x2014; the uncertainty and hazards amid the invasion are too high and local banks have seen a plunge in lending, despite record-high profits. &#x201C;There&apos;s a war environment which makes it riskier to lend, so there&apos;s a certain hesitation,&#x201D; Tuerkner said. &#xA0; Ukrainian first responders work at the site of a Russian missile attack on a publishing factory in Kharkiv, Ukraine on May 23, 2024. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)The EBRD is encouraging local banks to lend through portfolio risk-sharing programs focusing on energy needs, veteran-run businesses, and small and medium-sized businesses impacted by the war. By the year&apos;s end, the EBRD will have facilitated lending in the banking market of 1.1 billion euros. To mold an attractive investment climate in the long run, Tuerkner said Ukraine must strengthen anti-corruption measures and combat the harassment of businesses by tax authorities. Leaders in Ukraine&#x2019;s business sector have raised the alarm over the past year over heavy-handed pressure and intimidation on businesses. The government earlier this year implemented a set of reforms of the Bureau of Economic Security, the agency widely seen as responsible for the pressure. &#xA0;The bank also backs projects with a focus on anti-corruption trainings with institutions like the Restoration Agency, where Tuerkner said Ukraine is making steps in the right direction. The biggest driver for change is the EU integration process as well as conditions set by donors, he added. &#x201C;Businesses see the EU integration process and that might make investors change their minds,&#x201D; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-needs-fast-and-focused-help-with-energy-security-erbd-ukraine-head-says/	2024-11-14T07:39:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2156629152.jpg
Ukraine's sovereign bonds surge after Trump victory as investors expect peace talks, FT reports	Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereign bonds rose in price after Donald Trump&#x2019;s win in the U.S. presidential elections as investors expect a quicker end to the war, the Financial Times reported on Nov. 14. Over the past month, the country&apos;s dollar-dominated bonds have risen 12%, FT reported, as investors anticipate Trump will push for a ceasefire that could jumpstart Ukraine&apos;s recovery and ability to repay its creditors. The outlet pointed out that the jump in Ukrainian bonds began in mid-October when markets began to believe in a Trump victory. Trump has pledged to end the war within &quot;24 hours,&quot; sparking fears he might push Ukraine toward painful territorial concessions to achieve a quick peace deal. The rise in price follows an agreement reached in September between Ukraine and its creditors to restructure more than $20 billion in international debt. The deal shrank Ukraine&apos;s state debt by $9 billion, allowing it to avert default and helped its economy stay afloat amid Russia&apos;s full-scale war. The country&apos;s bond maturing in 2036 rose from 44 to 49 cents on the dollar in the past month, FT reported. GDP-warrants, a growth-related fixed-income instrument, also jumped to a record high following Trump&#x2019;s election since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion began in February 2022. The FT also reported that a bond owned by Ukraine&apos;s state-owned grid operator Ukrenergo rallied more than 160% to 67 cents on the dollar. Bloomberg reported last week that Ukrenergo announced it would suspend bond payments on its dollar-denominated notes that mature in 2028 and would seek a restructuring agreement with creditors. Not all investors are so bullish about Ukraine&apos;s recovery prospects. Portfolio Manager at Federated Hermes Mohammed Elmi told the FT that &quot;There is still a significant amount of unanswered questions&#x201D; about the country&apos;s future after any potential negotiated settlement.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-sovereign-bonds-jump-after-trumps-victory-as-investors-expect-peace-deal-ft-reports/	2024-11-14T07:30:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182537136.jpg
Russian soldiers murdered civilian in Donetsk Oblast village, prosecutors say	Russian soldiers shot dead an unarmed woman walking on the street of the front-line village of Terny in Donetsk Oblast, the Donetsk Oblast Prosecutor&apos;s Office reported on Nov. 14. Numerous cases of Russian troops murdering or abusing civilians have surfaced since the start of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, underscoring the humanitarian disaster wrought by the war. Pictures shared on the prosecutor&apos;s office&apos;s Telegram channel show a woman in a pink jacket walking on the outskirts of the village, with a subsequent picture showing her lying on the ground with her face in the mud. &quot;Russian soldiers saw a local resident walking down the street along the houses destroyed by the enemy. The soldiers opened fire on the woman. A shot from small arms killed the civilian,&quot; the statement read. According to the prosecutors, the killing took place on Nov. 10. Ukrainian authorities have launched a war crime investigation. Terny is a front-line village in northern Donetsk Oblast, some 35 kilometers (20 miles) northeast of the city of Sloviansk. Russia has committed 137,000 war crimes in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the United for Justice conference in Kyiv in September. The International Criminal Court (ICC) announced in June that it had issued arrest warrants for Sergei Shoigu, Russia&apos;s former defense minister, and Valery Gerasimov, chief of the General Staff of the Russian army, for intentionally harming civilians and other charges related to Russian strikes on Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure. The court also issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin in March 2023 over the forced deportation of Ukrainian children.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-soldiers-murdered-civilian-in-donetsk-oblast-village-prosecutors-say/	2024-11-14T05:55:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Donetsk-Oblast-prosecutors-Nov-14.jpg
Trump's nominee for UN envoy dodges question on earlier support for Ukraine's NATO accession	Donald Trump&apos;s pick for the U.N. envoy, Elise Stefanik, dodged questions on her earlier support for Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession and on calling Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine &quot;genocidal,&quot; with her office saying her views now fully align with Trump&apos;s, CNN reported on Nov. 13.

Opinion: Aid to Ukraine is now a 2-way street empowering US drone warfare	Before the election, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said he had &quot;little appetite&quot; for further military aid to Ukraine. While the sentiment is somewhat understandable, it misses a critical point: the nature of warfare has fundamentally changed over the past year, and Ukraine&#x2019;s aid no longer needs to be a one-way street. Ukraine can now offer its expertise and technology to the U.S. in return. Ukraine possesses the world&#x2019;s most advanced tactical unmanned and autonomous weaponry, along with the hard-won experience to deploy it in the world&#x2019;s most sophisticated battle space. The technology and training Ukraine can offer far outweigh the value of the aid Johnson is hesitant to provide. He may be missing the deal of the century. It is becoming increasingly clear to the American defense establishment just how dramatically unmanned and autonomous systems (UAS) warfare has shifted the battlefield &#x2014; and how precarious the U.S. security posture is as a result. Former U.S. General David Petraeus and former U.S. Army special-operations commander Andy Yakulis note that the pace of drone operations in Ukraine &quot;highlights the urgency with which the U.S. must overhaul its defense system, from operational concepts, structures, and training to weapons systems, procurement, and manufacturing.&quot; Recognition of the problem is widespread, but systematic solutions to address the problem are slow in coming. Matthew Rose and Kathryn Levantovscaia of the Atlantic Council say that &quot;Despite the rapid evolution of drone technology over the last two decades, the United States military did not release its first Counter-Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Strategy until 2021, and it&#x2019;s vastly insufficient to address the new security challenges afoot.&quot; Opinion on Capitol Hill is much the same &#x2014; staffers warn that the U.S. has a serious problem on its hands and is &#x201C;way behind the curve&#x201D; in addressing the unmanned threat. Meanwhile, Ukraine is leading the charge. By necessity, it has become the world&#x2019;s preeminent developer in this new battle space, only whiskers ahead in a breakneck race with Russia. Both sides have adapted unmanned systems in ways thought inconceivable just a few short years ago. Ukraine is on track to produce 1.2 million drones this year, with plans to grow toward 4 million annually. Although security restrictions make it difficult to say for certain, this likely surpasses U.S. Defense Department acquisitions by orders of magnitude. The number of drone manufacturers in Ukraine has increased from seven in 2022 to over 100 in 2024. Ukraine&#x2019;s rapid research and development cycle, built upon a decentralized &#x201C;lev&#xE9;e en masse&#x201D; production system, allows it to lead the global UAS market and deliver innovative solutions to the battlefield at an astonishing rate.

(Sergei Supinsky/AFP via Getty Images)The pace of this development is only accelerating. Ukraine is rapidly advancing artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and sensor technologies, swarm technology, and the integration of computer vision and real-time data processing, as well as diversifying its UAS portfolio with specialized developments drones for carriers, targets, electronic warfare, and kamikaze attacks. In short, Ukraine has earned its fearsome reputation for multi-domain drone operations, and it&#x2019;s time for the U.S. to fully embrace this fact. Ukrainian technical creativity has reshaped modern warfare, and the U.S. defense establishment should be eager to exchange some of its war materiel for the tactical lessons Ukraine has learned. Other global actors have already recognized the strategic potential of partnering with Ukraine&#x2019;s defense sector. Prominent players like U.S.-based Skydio, Germany&#x2019;s Quantum-Systems, and Turkey&#x2019;s Baykar have quickly set up offices or drone manufacturing plants in Ukraine. They understand, as American politicians do not, that Ukraine is the new global center for technical innovation. Vast, well-funded military-industrial complexes like in the U.S. are predictably slow to adapt to new realities. Russia, China, and the U.S. must now reckon with the fact that their expensive, high-tech weapons systems &#x2014; the result of decades of acquisition &#x2014; are vulnerable to relatively inexpensive systems. Ukraine&#x2019;s naval drones, which cost just $200,000 each, have already destroyed two dozen Russian warships in the Black Sea, forcing Russia to retreat from the Crimean coast. Estimates suggest the Russian Army has lost approximately 9,000 tanks, 18,000 armored vehicles, 20,000 artillery systems, 369 aircraft, 329 helicopters, and over 700,000 personnel &#x2014; many of these losses due to drone attacks. In October alone, Ukraine&#x2019;s UAS &quot;destroyed or damaged&quot; over 52,000 Russian targets, including 129 artillery systems, 221 pieces of radio equipment, and more than 4,000 Russian troops. Ukrainian drone strikes have also targeted over 30 oil refineries, reducing Russian crude processing capacity by as much as 14.5%. Ukrainian drone swarms have played key roles not only in standoff attacks on oil refineries and military bases but also in Ukraine&#x2019;s successful incursion into the Kursk oblast. It has become a joke among Ukrainians that while Russia &#x201C;shoots down all incoming drones,&#x201D; the &quot;falling debris&quot; is bleeding its war machine dry. But if U.S. defense planners believe Russia will remain passive or static in its response, they are in for a rude awakening. Russia has been investing in domestic drone production since 2008 and announced plans this year to ramp up production by nearly tenfold to 1.4 million units. While Russia&#x2019;s reliance on foreign components and its failure to implement decentralized production models give Ukraine an advantage, it remains a formidable competitor in the drone space. Its partnerships with Iran, North Korea, and possibly China mean there&#x2019;s no time to waste for the U.S. The pace of technological development on the Ukrainian battlefield is pushing both sides to innovate rapidly. Russians continue to try to replicate Ukraine&#x2019;s drone technologies and tactics, motivating Ukrainians to develop even more sophisticated innovations. This accelerated arms race demands that the U.S. stay updated on developments such as &quot;dragon drones&quot; that release molten thermite on enemy positions and the Palianytsia, a hybrid rocket-drone with a long-range strike capability of 435 miles (700 km). Ukraine still desperately needs key investments in its defense sector and continued military aid, while the U.S. must learn to operate effectively in the newest battle domain. As Ukraine seeks foreign capital for its military-defense complex, Russia&#x2019;s attacks persist, fueled by fresh transfers from North Korea and Iran. As these autocratic nations push the world toward potential conflict, it&#x2019;s vital for the U.S. and Ukraine to work out bilateral defense arrangements that serve both countries&apos; vital interests. This two-way partnership would be relatively simple to establish: Ukraine can already supply tens of thousands of the most advanced First-Person-View (FPV) attack drones to the U.S. Defense Department, along with training from some of the world&#x2019;s most skilled drone pilots. Many of these courses can be taught virtually, allowing Ukrainian instructors to continue fighting while sharing tactical and technical updates with their American counterparts. The initiative has strong political backing. Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks&#x2019; Replicator Initiative aims to equip operational units with &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of drones by next year. Outsourcing this monumental acquisition to Ukraine would be a straightforward proposition, provided red tape is eliminated in the national interest. After all, Ukraine is the best place to buy drones right now &#x2014; not only are they the most advanced, but they&#x2019;re also comparatively cheap. Allied weapons have given Ukraine the time to build its defense frameworks, and it is now developing new technologies and tactics at a rapid pace. Ukraine can now offer the U.S. a tremendous asset in exchange for the aid it has received: deep, relevant experience in the world&#x2019;s most advanced battle space. Now that the election is over, sending Ukraine the weapons and funds it needs in exchange for cutting-edge technology, tactics, and training is a bargain Speaker Johnson would be foolish to ignore.

We asked experts to review Russia's Su-57 fighter jet performance at Airshow China 2024	The long and troubled history of Russia&apos;s prized Su-57 fighter jet appeared to take another turn for the worse in recent days when what should have been an opportunity for the Kremlin to flex some military muscle turned into global ridicule and embarrassment. The aircraft made an impressive aerobatic display during a demonstration flight at the Airshow China 2024 aerospace exhibition in Zhuhai. Russia&apos;s official X account lauded the performance as &quot;jaw-dropping,&quot; adding its &quot;fifth-gen Sukhoi Su-57 fighter jet can do just about anything in capable hands.&quot; But the triumph was short-lived. A flurry of close-ups of the parked fighter jet taken by members of the public suggested its build quality and stealth capabilities were suspect, to say the least. Some far from hi-tech bolts and what appeared to be filler between panels prompted mockery on social media. Apart from aesthetics and safety, this would render the plane&apos;s fuselage detectable to radars, negating its stealth ability. The Su-57 was meant to rival the fifth-generation fighter jets of other countries, particularly the U.S. But despite a decades-long development and testing program, it has yet to prove itself. Russia claims the aircraft has fifth-generation capabilities, which means it should have ultra-high maneuverability, supersonic speed without using afterburners, and, most importantly, stealth technology. The plane has been presented as Russia&apos;s most modern fighter jet. Only a few units are in service within the Russian Air Force. Sergei Shoigu, now head of Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s security council, said in 2022, while serving as defense minister, that the Su-57 has &quot;shown itself brilliantly&quot; in attacks against Ukraine. Yet, it has not played a particularly large role in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion launched early that year. An assessment from the British Defense Ministry in January 2023 said Russia&apos;s risk-averse approach to using the Su-57 was &quot;symptomatic&quot; of the military&apos;s wider approach to the war. &quot;Russia is highly likely prioritizing avoiding the reputational damage, reduced export prospects, and the compromise of sensitive technology which would come from any loss of (a Su-57) over Ukraine,&quot; it said. We asked aviation experts what they made of the Su-57s performance in China. The close up view was interesting in that it showed a poor level of engineering workmanship that you would expect on a stealth aircraft. Every overlap, every gap increases your radar cross section and there were plenty on view. It&apos;s indicative of a poor manufacturing and quality control process. And we know that the real advances are inside a modern combat aircraft. If they can&apos;t get the simple external bits right then it&apos;s unlikely the internal systems will fare much better. What can I say that&apos;s publishable? It&apos;s not very good. This was meant to be the big unveiling of the Russian fifth-generation equivalent of the (U.S.-made) F-35, and it hasn&apos;t gone down as well as I think the Russians would have been hoping. I think one of the big mistakes Russia made was that they allowed people at the air show to essentially get really up close to this aircraft. They want to take pictures. Those pictures have now appeared on social media. And they show the version that&apos;s been taken to the air show, perhaps it&apos;s not quite as fifth-generation as has been claimed by the Russians. So it has done some sort of flight demonstrations and has shown its capabilities as a conventional fighter aircraft, and in that I think it&apos;s done a relatively good job. It&apos;s shown its capabilities, it&apos;s shown what it can do. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s exceeded expectations but I certainly don&apos;t think it&apos;s diminished, or gone below the expectations of what was expected. Russia&apos;s Sukhoi Su-57 stealth fighter jet flies during the 15th China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition, or Airshow China 2024, on November 12, 2024 (Fu Tian/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images)The way it&apos;s been assembled looks very slapdash, and there aren&apos;t smooth lines on the aircraft which is what you&apos;d expect from a stealth aircraft to reduce that radar signal. If you&apos;re looking at aircraft performance in terms of maneuverability, it can do the job that you would expect it to do. But of course the problem comes when you&apos;re trying to maneuver in a hostile airspace where your opponent has got the ability to track you by radar. Okay, you can maneuver, you can do all of that. But you&apos;re going to put yourself in more harm and create more challenges to yourself by the fact that you&apos;re more easily seen by those radar systems. So yeah, it&apos;s a capable aircraft. It&apos;ll do a very good job, I think, of what the Russians would want it to do in terms of perhaps air-to-air combat. But when it comes to the crunch, you&apos;re going to have to do this in an engaged, hostile airspace where things like radar are going to be widely used. And is that maneuverability enough for you to survive both as the pilot and to maintain the airframe? As with other weapon systems such as the T-14 Armata Main Battle Tank (MBT), Russia seems unwilling to use the Su-57 in its purported high-capability role. It has &apos;countered&apos; the Patriot (air defense) system by using standoff missiles from outside Patriot&apos;s range, suggesting the operators are aware of the aircraft&apos;s weaknesses. Whether these will be successfully eliminated remains to be seen. This situation is most likely an artifact of internal politics. Facing demands to present an operational aircraft, those responsible for the development of the Su-57 have cut corners in order to, apparently, give their superiors what they want. Build quality issues can be addressed later, or the blame deflected once the pressure is off. Russia&apos;s Sukhoi Su-57 stealth fighter jet conducts adaptive training for the upcoming 15th China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition, or Airshow China 2024, on November 10, 2024 in Zhuhai, Guangdong Province of China (Chen Jimin/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images)Peter Layton, associate fellow at the Royal United Services InstituteMy understanding is that the aircraft at the airshow was a tester, and so it wasn&apos;t of the build standard you&apos;d expect. It was just a prototype used to try out and test things. Also, it probably wasn&apos;t full of the guidance systems and electronics that you&apos;d expect in an in-service airplane. It was a sort of lightweight, pilot-fun version. Its aerodynamic performance was certainly sparkling, but probably doesn&apos;t represent what the actual in-service aircraft could do because it would be more heavily loaded down. And it wasn&apos;t made to the same build standards as the production models, presumably. Having said that, the Russians&apos; aerodynamics have always been superior to the West&apos;s since about the late 1960s. Western aviation companies had superior computers, so they could make anything fly. The Russians didn&apos;t have all those computers, so they had to specialize in the mathematics of making the aircraft actually fly well purely as a structural issue and not be reliant on computers as much. So, the fact that it performs well is probably no surprise at all. Of course, this always brings up the argument that maneuverability is all well and good if you&apos;re doing close fights in a telephone booth kind of warfare. But these days, they standoff at 50-60 nautical miles (90-110 kilometers) and use their radars to shoot off long-range missiles at you. So the maneuverability might be good for avoiding missiles in their terminal phase, but it&apos;s more of a trick for air shows rather than any practical combat value. There&apos;s an argument that this was a test plane and it was built shoddily. The other argument is, of course, maybe they didn&apos;t want to send their latest and best possible build on the off-chance the Chinese perhaps learn something from it. So they may have needed to ensure the industrial espionage side of things had been taken care of because air shows are places where all sorts of people get to crawl all over aircraft. So, from a security point of view, if you do have something sensitive, it&apos;s probably not the best idea to send it to one.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-asked-experts-to-review-russias-su-57-fighter-jet-performance-at-airshow-china-2024/	2024-11-14T04:09:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184134178.jpg
Trump's victory offers chance for renewed dialogue with US, Russia's UN envoy says	Donald Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. election will do &quot;little to alter&quot; Washington&apos;s policy toward Moscow but might open up a chance for a dialogue, Russia&apos;s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva said on Nov. 14, Reuters reported. Trump&apos;s imminent return to the White House has prompted anxiety in Ukraine and European allies over the president-elect&apos;s amiable views on Russian President Vladimir Putin. &quot;The only shift (that) might be possible is (a) dialogue between our countries, something that has been lacking during the last several years,&quot; Ambassador Gennady Gatilov said, according to Reuters. At the same time, Gatilov does not expect any tectonic shift in future relations between the U.S. and Russia. &quot;Regardless of domestic political shifts, (Washington) consistently pursues a sense of containing Moscow...the change of administration does little to alter it,&quot; the ambassador added. In the past, Trump has called Russian President Vladimir Putin a &quot;genius&quot; and someone who &quot;respects&quot; him. Trump also claimed on Oct. 14 that he &quot;(got) along very well with Putin&quot; during his first presidential term in 2017-2021. He implied that the Russian leader told him about his ambitions to control Ukraine. &quot;It (Ukraine) was the apple of his eye; he used to talk about it. But I said, &apos;You&apos;re not going in,&apos; and he wasn&apos;t going in,&quot; Trump said at a campaign event. In a phone call shortly after his electoral victory, Trump allegedly warned Putin not to escalate the war, but the Kremlin later flat-out denied that the call took place. U.S.-Russia relations sank over Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, rendering Putin a persona non grata in much of the Western countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-victory-offers-chance-for-renewed-dialogue-with-us-russias-un-envoy-says/	2024-11-14T04:03:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1238897378.jpg
Opinion: How EU nations can prevent the worst-case outcome for Ukraine	Russian President Vladimir Putin clearly hopes to exploit any effort by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to enforce a de facto capitulation of Ukraine. How might this plan unfold, and what should EU countries do now? This is how an ideal scenario might look for Russia: Step 1: Trump wants a deal, so Putin might agree if a ceasefire recognizes Russia&#x2019;s &#x201C;legitimate interests&#x201D;: around one-fifth of Ukraine&#x2019;s territory would fall under Russian control, including Crimea, and Western economic sanctions would ease partially. Russia would also secure a guarantee that Ukraine won&#x2019;t join NATO. Russia has less concern about Ukrainian EU membership, expecting that Western European states would block it for years due to commercial interests. Additionally, Ukraine would face limits on certain offensive weapons. Step 2: Putin has little reason to stop; victorious dictators rarely do. If Trump imposes any of these surrender demands on Ukraine, it would mean geostrategic disaster. Without U.S. support, Ukraine&#x2019;s military struggle would become unsustainable, as European aid alone is insufficient. Any Ukrainian leader would be forced to accept these terms under U.S. pressure. Step 3: Russia expects these conditions to fuel intense anti-Western sentiment in Ukraine, driven by a sense of betrayal after years of brave fighting and heavy losses in Europe&#x2019;s defense. Step 4: Ultimately, Russia hopes this would lead to Ukraine&#x2019;s internal political collapse. Ukrainians and parts of the leadership would resist such terms, potentially ousting any leader forced to agree to them, or that leader might resign &#x2014; much like Czechoslovak President Edvard Bene&#x161; did after the 1938 Munich betrayal by France and Great Britain. Russia expects millions of Ukrainians to flee to the EU &#x2014; particularly to Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic &#x2014; out of fear of Russian reprisals. At that point, Russia would only need to rebuild its offensive forces, continue destabilizing Ukraine through hybrid tactics, and watch as a wave of Ukrainian refugees strains EU resources and fuels pro-Russian factions in Germany and beyond. What can EU states do to prevent this worst-case scenario? First, increase defense spending to 3% of GDP. Whether to prepare for a potential Russian attack on NATO or to defend Europe without U.S. support, it&#x2019;s a critical step. Second, provide Ukraine with all available weapons that Europe can supply, purchasing them from global sources as necessary. Third, deploy EU troops &#x2014; several divisions totaling tens of thousands &#x2014; along the contact line between Ukrainian and Russian forces once any deal is reached to freeze the Russian assault. Without this presence, any border on a map would rely entirely on Russia&#x2019;s will. Fourth, confiscate frozen Russian assets held under EU sanctions. Auction these assets and use the proceeds to fund critical defense measures, including support for Ukraine. And fifth, offer Trump a compromise: If he refrains from throwing Ukraine overboard, the EU could allocate these funds from these assets to purchase American weapons for Ukraine and for European NATO states. All of the above measures are technically and legally feasible. Their success depends on Europe&#x2019;s political will to prevent a Russian strategic victory. The more we act, the stronger our efforts will be.

European officials opening up to 'land-for-security' deal in Ukraine, WP reports	Kyiv&apos;s European partners are increasingly preparing for a deal that could include Ukraine giving up on some of its territories in return for security guarantees, the Washington Post reported on Nov. 13, citing interviews with 10 current and former Western officials. The news comes amid Ukraine&apos;s mounting setbacks on the battlefield and uncertainties about U.S. support under incoming President Donald Trump. The U.S. president-elect has pledged to end the war &quot;within 24&quot; hours, sparking concerns he might push Ukraine toward painful concessions. While publicly declaring full support for Ukraine, the idea of ceding territory is quietly gaining more traction among Western officials, even though the details of such an agreement remain unclear, the Washington Post wrote. &quot;I think everybody has more or less reached this conclusion. It&apos;s hard to say it publicly because it would be a way of saying we are going to reward aggression,&quot; Gerard Araud, a former French ambassador to the U.S., told the news outlet. The proposal is being allegedly reframed from &quot;land-for-peace&quot; to &quot;security-for-peace&quot; to stress the necessity for security guarantees that would prevent further Russian aggression. Russia currently occupies roughly one-fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory in the south and the east. Kyiv has repeatedly said that entry to NATO is the most secure way to avert future wars, but the proposal has met cold responses from a number of allies. Quick accession seems even more unlikely now as one proposal from Trump&apos;s team reportedly includes delaying Ukraine&apos;s entry by at least 20 years and instead supplying it with sufficient arms to repel Russia on its own. Ukraine and Russia held unsuccessful negotiations in early 2022. The initial version of Russia&apos;s peace proposal issued shortly after the start of the full-scale invasion and leaked to the media this year was described as an effective surrender of Ukraine. The terms became more moderate later on and included reducing Ukraine&apos;s military size, prohibiting NATO entry but allowing EU accession, and postponing the matter of occupied territories to a later date. The treaty would be backed by international guarantors like the U.K., the U.S., China, and France. The negotiations eventually failed, and no direct talks have been held between Ukraine and Russia since then. Kyiv has insisted that a peace settlement should be based on President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s 10-point peace formula, which includes the restoration of full territorial integrity. Some Ukrainian officials acknowledged, however, that some territory would have to be liberated by diplomatic means as the country&apos;s manpower and resources dwindle in the face of unrelenting Russian attacks. There seems to be little readiness for compromise in Moscow as its forces continue steadily advancing in Donetsk Oblast. Russia&apos;s economy has largely weathered Western sanctions and managed to offset its heavy battlefield casualties better than Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in October that his country is not planning any concessions and said that a peace deal must favor Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/european-officials-peace-deal-wp/	2024-11-14T03:20:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1958294777.jpg
Opinion: Trump could actually be good for Europe	Before the U.S. presidential election, it seemed like no one but Donald Trump&#x2019;s staunchest supporters believed he could win. After all, the man is a convicted felon, a putschist-provocateur, an agent of chaos, and a walking scandal who has been disowned by almost all his former advisors, some of whom describe him as a fascist. Moreover, the incumbent Democratic administration presides over an economy with low inflation, low unemployment, high economic growth, a record-high stock market, and major new investments in infrastructure, technology, and green energy. Yet it happened. Much has already been written about the reasons for the Democrats&#x2019; failure, and about the dire implications of another Trump presidency. With Trump, it is difficult to predict anything, especially now that he is no longer surrounded by serious, reasonable advisors and seasoned politicians. Nor is his Republican Party what it used to be. Like Poland&#x2019;s Law and Justice (PiS) party under Jaros&#x142;aw Kaczy&#x144;ski, the GOP has effectively become the property of its leader. Still, let&#x2019;s try to think of something positive, if only to ward off fatalism or despair. First, there is the war in Ukraine. Although the Biden administration has devoted plenty of attention to this issue, one thing is certain: continuing the same policy would not lead to an outright victory for Ukraine. Biden&#x2019;s approach did not guarantee success, and may instead have guaranteed only a slow bleed in Eastern Europe. Trump&#x2019;s unpredictability may therefore have a silver lining. It was he, after all, who sent the first shipment of anti-tank Javelin missiles that later aided Ukraine&#x2019;s initial defense. When Ukraine approached Barack Obama&#x2019;s administration to purchase lethal arms after Russia&#x2019;s 2014 incursions into its territory, it was turned down. And when Russia began amassing troops and military equipment near the Ukrainian border in March 2021, the Biden administration approved only $125 million in aid, followed by another $60 million that May. Yes, Trump threatened to withhold aid unless Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky helped him implicate the Biden family in corrupt dealings. But this plot blew up in his face and led to his first impeachment. Looking ahead, it is rather hard to imagine that a man with such a big, all-consuming ego would simply hand over Ukraine. What would he get out of it? Putin has nothing to offer, and he has become a junior partner to China, Trump&#x2019;s b&#xEA;te noire. As for the broader transatlantic relationship, America&#x2019;s pivot away from Europe was going to happen sooner or later. It has been dragging on since the Obama years, and now the European Union may finally get the jolt it needs. You cannot drag your feet forever when it comes to investing in your own arms industry and defense. If South Korea can afford it, why can&#x2019;t Germany and the EU as a whole? The COVID-19 shock already significantly reshaped the EU for the better, proving &#x2014; finally &#x2014; that is possible to incur common debt to finance necessary investments. Equally, the war in Ukraine showed that the EU should also have a common defense policy. Now it will finally have to pursue this goal in earnest. Since Europeans can afford it, there is no reason to rely on support from someone else. Poland has been a leader in this respect, having already put its defense spending on track to reach 5% of GDP by 2025. Again, why can&#x2019;t Germany do the same? If properly armed, the EU is fully capable of defending its eastern flank. Considering that the risks are distributed unevenly (with Poland and other Eastern European countries being the most exposed), the least that the rest of the EU can do is share the expense of a common defense budget. Poles also can be somewhat reassured by the fact that Trump&#x2019;s Euroskepticism is directed primarily at Western Europe, since it is Germany and France that compete economically with the United States. While the new American right has little patience for &#x201C;Old Europe,&#x201D; it loves &#x201C;New Europe,&#x201D; owing to its own right-wing populist leanings. Perhaps these political impulses can finally be of some use. Hitherto, Poland&#x2019;s PiS-aligned president, Andrzej Duda, has only hurt the country; but as a good friend of Trump&#x2019;s, he may now have a beneficial role to play. In any case, the leadership crises in Germany, France, and Spain have brought Poland and Italy to the fore. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni can help lead while Western Europe gets its act together. With many allies and a budget 10 times larger than Russia&#x2019;s, Europeans can easily take care of themselves as long as they maintain a united front. We no longer have any excuse not to tackle our own problems. Editor&#x2019;s Note: Copyright, Project Syndicate.

Abandoning Ukraine would be worse for US than Afghanistan withdrawal, ex-UK chief diplomat says	Ukraine&apos;s collapse would be a bigger humiliation for the U.S. than its withdrawal from Afghanistan, former U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague said at The Telegraph&apos;s podcast on Nov. 13. &quot;(Donald) Trump highlighted (Joe) Biden&apos;s humiliation over Afghanistan&#x2026; but if he ends up with the collapse of Ukraine, that&#x2019;ll be a far bigger humiliation for the U.S. and the power of the U.S. in the world,&quot; the former foreign secretary said at the Daily T podcast. U.S. President-elect Trump&#x2019;s support for Ukraine hangs in the air as analysts and politicians try to gauge his plans to bring peace to Ukraine, as he promised to end the war within &quot;24 hours&quot; after reelection without revealing details. The U.S. withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021 under the Biden administration, ending 20 years of military presence. The Taliban movement quickly overran the country soon after. &quot;It is in Trump&#x2019;s best interest, his own best interest, to maintain the strength of the West of these things,&quot; said the foreign secretary in David Cameron&apos;s cabinet between 2010-2014. &quot;It&#x2019;s really worrying that President-elect Trump is coming in with what seems to be a pretty strong view that this can be settled quickly, but settled on terms that would overwhelmingly favor Russia,&quot; Hague said, adding that any such freezing of the war along the current front lines would only pave the way for another war, as &quot;Putin would come back for the rest of Ukraine.&quot; Kyiv&apos;s allies have been trying to &quot;Trump-proof&quot; their support for Ukraine, with Poland coordinating with the U.K. to maintain the support after Trump takes office in 2025. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk intends to hold talks with his British counterpart Keir Starmer in the coming days. The Biden administration also plans to increase U.S. military assistance to Ukraine in the final months of its term to give as much support as possible before Trump takes office in January 2025, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Brussels on Nov. 13. &quot;The lesson of that should not be lost on us now, which is that we should not go soft on (Russia) them now,&quot; Hague said, referring to the period of 2014-2015 when Western countries did little to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for his annexation of Crimea and starting a war in eastern Ukraine. &quot;We should have been more tough then and resolute now,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/hague-on-ukraine-afghanistan/	2024-11-14T02:31:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183101820.jpg
Ukraine repels Russian attempt to enter Kupiansk, military says	Ukrainian forces successfully repelled Russian attempts to break into the city of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukrinfrom reported on Nov. 14, citing the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. &quot;All Russian attacks in this direction were successfully repelled. Russian invaders failed to enter Kupiansk. The city is under the control of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces,&quot; General Staff spokesperson Andrii Kovalev told Ukrinform. The statement comes after the crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState claimed late on Nov. 13 that some Russian units, including armored vehicles and a tank, managed to enter Kupiansk but soon suffered heavy losses. Kupiansk is a key logistics and railway hub in the eastern part of Kharkiv Oblast. With several highways and five railway lines running through it, the town was briefly occupied by Russian forces before it was liberated during a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive in the autumn of 2022. An estimated Russian advance (red) near Kupiansk as of Nov. 13, 2024, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)According to Kovalev, Russian forces attempted to break through Ukrainian defenses in the area at around 2:30 p.m. local time on Nov. 13, attacking in four waves. They employed 15 vehicles, including tanks and armored fighting vehicles. The spokesperson said that Russian troops wore Ukrainian uniforms, which violates international rules of warfare. Ukrainian defenders destroyed &quot;all Russian armored vehicles&quot; and a &quot;significant part of manpower,&quot; he added. Russian troops ramped up their efforts near Kupiansk in early September and are now only 2 to 3 kilometers from the city&#x2019;s industrial outskirts in the northeast. Moscow&apos;s forces are attempting to find a footing for a final push to reach the Oskil River, dividing the city into two, before winter sets in. During his evening address, President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the soldiers defending the front line and spoke of Russia&apos;s &quot;attempts to expand their offensive, especially in the Kupiansk direction.&quot; &quot;I am grateful to all our units for their resilience,&quot; he said. Even if Russian units have not yet entered the town, regular shelling of the city creates increasingly hard conditions for the locals to continue with their lives, with no gas, water, or electricity in the city&#x2019;s eastern bank. Capturing the city would widen the north-to-south supply route from Russia&#x2019;s Belgorod Oblast, fuelling their attempt to take the entire Donbas region.	https://kyivindependent.com/kupiansk-russian-attack/	2024-11-14T01:39:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2151152486.jpg
Trump wants to bring Ukraine, Russia to negotiating table, national security advisor nominee says	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump wants to bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table to end the war, Mike Waltz, Trump&apos;s pick for a national security advisor, told Voice of America (Voa) on Nov. 13. Speaking to a VoA correspondent, the Florida Congressman said that Trump is interested in ending the war instead of continuing it. Waltz stressed that Washington&apos;s future policy does not depend on him but on Trump&apos;s decisions. Trump has pledged to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine &quot;within 24 hours&quot; once reelected without explaining how he plans to achieve it. Multiple media reports indicated that this plan might entail freezing the war, suspending Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession, and establishing a demilitarized zone in the east of the country. Russia and Ukraine have not held direct talks since the unsuccessful negotiations in Belarus and Turkey in early 2022. Publicly, there appears to be little room for compromise as Kyiv has repeatedly rejected territorial concessions, while Russia has little reason to negotiate as it currently holds the upper hand on the battlefield. Waltz is set to replace Jake Sullivan in the senior White House advisory role. In this position, he will brief Trump on main security issues and have a chance to influence key policy decisions. Trump&apos;s nominee has previously expressed reservations about continued extensive U.S. military aid to Ukraine, arguing that European nations should increase their support to ensure regional stability. His stance includes backing a peace plan aimed at drawing Ukraine closer to Western alliances while diplomatically isolating Russian President Vladimir Putin. This view, while reflective of a significant portion of Republican thought, contrasts with positions held by many Senate Republicans and most Democrats who continue to advocate for sustained or increased aid to Ukraine. Trump&apos;s cabinet picks have been met with mixed reactions in Ukraine. While some officials and observers reacted to Waltz and Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio with &quot;moderate optimism,&quot; other choices sparked surprise and even concern. The president-elect tapped military veteran and Fox News host Pete Hegseth to lead the Defense Department, a move that stunned Pentagon officials. Trump&apos;s nomination of openly Ukraine-skeptic ex-Democrat Tulsi Gabbard to the position of director of national intelligence is also not a positive signal for the besieged country. The former Congresswoman and Army National Guard veteran has echoed Putin&apos;s justification for the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, attributing the cause not to Moscow but to the Biden administration&apos;s failure to acknowledge &quot;Russia&#x2019;s legitimate security concerns.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-waltz-negotiations/	2024-11-14T01:05:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2162467139.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure 28 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least two civilians and injured at least 28 others, regional authorities reported on Nov. 14. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 21 of the 59 drones launched by Russia overnight, while 38 drones were &quot;lost&quot; across Ukraine, the Air Force said. Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast killed two people and injured eight, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. One person was killed and two wounded in the village of Novotroitske, and one civilian was killed and another injured in the Shevchenko village. Four residents were injured in the city of Kostiantynivka and one in Predtechyne, Filashkin said. A Russian drone struck an apartment building in Kharkiv on Nov. 13, with two people suffering shrapnel wounds. A 67-year-old driver of a medical facility was also wounded in Kupiansk, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. In Kherson Oblast, 15 people were injured in Russian attacks, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. A utility company, a fire station, and residential buildings were damaged. Two civilians were injured during Russian attacks against the Myropillia community in Sumy Oblast, the regional military administration reported. Dnipropetrovsk, Kyiv, Poltava, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts were also attacked, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-104/	2024-11-13T23:45:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Donetsk-Oblast-Nov-14.jpg
Marco Rubio confirmed as Trump's secretary of state pick	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 13 officially confirmed Republican Senator Marco Rubio as his nominee for the secretary of state, the U.S.&apos;s top diplomacy job. Rubio thanked Trump for the nomination in a statement on social media. &quot;Leading the U.S. Department of State is a tremendous responsibility, and I am honored by the trust President Trump has placed in me,&quot; Rubio wrote on X. His imminent nomination was reported in the media earlier this week. Rubio publicly praised the bravery of Ukrainian defenders but was among the 15 Republican lawmakers in the Senate who voted against the $61 billion aid package for Ukraine, which was eventually passed in April 2024. The 53-year-old Florida Senator will replace Antony Blinken in the position, and as the top U.S. diplomat, he would be at the forefront of any peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. Shortly after Trump&#x2019;s election victory, Rubio said on air that Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine has reached a &quot;stalemate&quot; and &quot;needs to be brought to a conclusion.&quot; On the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly said he could end Russia&apos;s war within 24 hours if elected president, without elaborating on how he plans to achieve it. Rubio described Ukrainians as &quot;incredibly brave and strong&quot; but said that there is still &quot;the reality of the war.&quot; &quot;That doesn&apos;t mean we celebrate what Vladimir Putin did or are excited about it, but I think there has to be some common sense here,&quot; he said. &quot;We are funding a stalemate that&apos;s costing lives... and Ukraine is going to take 100 years to rebuild with everything they&apos;re facing.&quot; Judging by his recent comments, Rubio is expected to take a more nuanced position that is tweaked to Trump&#x2019;s stance, as suggested by earlier reports by the &#xA0;Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/marco-rubio-confirmed-as-trumps-secretary-of-state-pick/	2024-11-13T23:15:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182884073.jpg
I can't imagine Trump abandoning Ukraine, Polish president says	President-elect Donald Trump will not allow Russia to destroy Ukraine because he &quot;does not like to lose&quot; and because the U.S. has already invested too many resources to let them go to waste, Polish President Andrzej Duda told a press conference on Nov. 13. &quot;President Donald Trump &#x2014; I cannot imagine that he would allow Russia to destroy Ukraine, in which the United States, in which the American taxpayer, for whose money President Donald Trump will soon be held accountable when he takes office, has invested such huge amounts,&#x201D; Duda said. Trump&#x2019;s support for Ukraine hangs in the air as analysts and politicians try to gauge his plans to bring peace to Ukraine, as he promised to end the war within &quot;24 hours&quot; after reelection without revealing details. The president-elect is a &quot;born fighter, he likes to fight and, above all, he does not like to lose,&quot; Duda noted. The Biden administration plans to increase U.S. military assistance to Ukraine in the final months of its term to give as much support as possible before Trump takes office in January 2025, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Brussels on Nov. 13. To &quot;Trump-proof&quot; their support for Ukraine, Poland began building an alliance with the U.K. to continue helping Ukraine after Donald Trump takes office in 2025. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk intends to hold talks with his British counterpart Keir Starmer in the coming days. Tusk will also meet President Emmanuel Macron of France and Mark Rutte, secretary-general of NATO, earlier reporting suggested. Outgoing President Biden has seen the handling of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine as a defining element of his presidency. He gradually gave more military aid to Ukraine as Kyiv emerged victorious from the early battle of Kyiv in April 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/i-cant-imagine-trump-abandoning-ukraine-polish-president-says/	2024-11-13T23:00:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1676988608.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 716,070 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 716,070 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Nov. 14. This number includes 1,690 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,319 tanks, 18,947 armored fighting vehicles, 29,090 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,472 artillery systems, 1,252 multiple launch rocket systems, 997 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 18,852 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-716-070-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-11-13T22:15:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2176223422.jpg
Biden, Xi to discuss China's support for Russia at upcoming summit in Peru	U.S. President Joe Biden will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Lima, Peru on Nov. 16, the White House announced Nov. 13. The summit likely marks the two leaders&apos; final presidential meeting, as Biden will be replaced by President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 20, 2025. Ukraine is on the agenda for Biden&apos;s talks with Xi, according to the White House. Biden is expected to voice his &quot;deep concern&quot; regarding China&apos;s &quot;support for Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine.&quot; This extends to North Korea&apos;s escalating military involvement, including the deployment of 10,000 troops &#xA0;who &quot;have begun engaging in combat operations with Russian forces.&quot; The Pentagon confirmed on Nov. 13 that North Korean soldiers had begun engaging in combat alongside Russian troops in Kursk Oblast. The announcement followed reports that Russia is mustering a force of 50,000 soldiers, including North Korean troops, to launch a counteroffensive against Ukraine in the Kursk region. &quot;We are increasingly concerned about the consequences for longer-term stability in both Europe and the Indo-Pacific of this deployment,&quot; a senior White House official said, regarding Biden&apos;s upcoming talks with Xi. While the U.S. has criticized China&apos;s support for Russia, including sanctioning Chinese companies for producing drones used in Russia&apos;s war, Biden&apos;s status as a lame-duck president weakens his position ahead of the meeting with Xi. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken pledged on Nov. 13 that the outgoing administration would &quot;continue to shore up everything we&apos;re doing for Ukraine&quot; and that NATO would issue &quot;a firm response&quot; to North Korea&apos;s deployment, but he did not say what the response would entail. Biden and Xi last met in person on the sidelines of the 2023 APEC Summit in San Francisco, California. Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine was one of the key topics during those talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-xi-to-discuss-chinas-support-for-russia-at-upcoming-summit-in-peru/	2024-11-13T20:39:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1784317745.jpg
Senate Republicans pick John Thune as new majority leader	Republicans in the U.S. Senate elected Sen. John Thune of South Dakota as their next majority leader in a 29-24 vote on Nov. 13. The Republican party took back control of the 100-seat chamber in the U.S. elections on Nov. 5. Republicans claimed a sweeping victory, securing control of the Senate, House of Representatives, and the White House. Thune represents the establishment wing of the conservative party, as opposed to those closely associated with President-elect Donald Trump. Trump allies including Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson advocated for Florida Sen. Rick Scott, a Trump loyalist, to win the majority leader role. Thune will officially become the majority leader when the new Senate is sworn in on Jan. 3, 2025. &quot;We are excited to reclaim the majority and to get to work with our colleagues in the House to enact President Trump&apos;s agenda,&quot; Thune told reporters after his election. In previous statements, Thune has expressed support for Ukraine, including backing continued U.S. aid to Kyiv amid a Republican-led congressional obstruction campaign. &quot;America cannot retreat from the world stage,&quot; he said in March 2024. &quot;American leadership is desperately needed ... and we need to make sure that Ukraine has the weaponry and the resources that it needs to defeat the Russians.&quot; While Thune has criticized Trump in the past, he reportedly told senators that he was willing to cooperate with Trump, including on issues relating to Ukraine, according to the Washington Post.	https://kyivindependent.com/senate-republicans-pick-john-thune-as-new-majority-leader/	2024-11-13T19:04:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184621649.jpg
Trump team plans to fire Pentagon officers, Reuters reports	Members of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s transition team are drawing up a list of potential military officers to fire at the Pentagon, Reuters reported on Nov. 13, citing unnamed sources familiar with the transition. Trump takes office on Jan. 25, 2025, and has begun selecting nominees to top positions in his cabinet from among his loyal supporters. The list of those to dismiss may include the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sources told Reuters, but the plans for the firings are still in the early stages of development. The Joint Chiefs of Staff comprise the highest-ranking officers in the U.S. military, including the heads of the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, National Guard, and Space Force. One source told Reuters that the Trump administration would look to get rid of any military officer connected to Mark Milley, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Trump and U.S. President Joe Biden. &quot;Every single person that was elevated and appointed by Milley will be gone,&quot; the source said. Milley reportedly described Trump as &quot;fascist to the core,&quot; according to the book &quot;War&quot; by journalist Bob Woodward, published in October. &quot;There&apos;s a very detailed list of everybody that was affiliated with Milley. And they will all be gone,&quot; the source said. Mass firings at the Pentagon and dismissal of the Joint Chiefs are unprecedented moves in a U.S. presidential transition. Reports of the potential firings come one day after Trump named Fox News host Pete Hegseth as his pick for U.S. Defense Secretary, stirring alarm among defense officials.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-team-plans-to-fire-pentagon-officers-reuters-reports/	2024-11-13T18:01:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/--------------2024-03-19-202210.png
Foreign Ministry responds to rumors of Kyiv's plans to build nuclear bomb	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry on Nov. 13 denied media reports suggesting that Kyiv was planning to develop weapons of mass destruction. &quot;Ukraine is committed to the NPT (the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons); we do not possess, develop, or intend to acquire nuclear weapons,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said via X. &quot;Ukraine works closely with the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) and is fully transparent to its monitoring, which rules out the use of nuclear materials for military purposes.&quot; The Times reported on Nov. 13 that Ukraine could develop a rudimentary nuclear bomb &quot;within months&quot; if U.S. military assistance under President-elect Donald Trump were to cease, according to a briefing paper prepared for the Ukrainian Defense Ministry seen by the outlet. The report suggests that Ukraine could swiftly build a basic device using plutonium and technology similar to that of the atomic bomb the U.S. dropped on Nagasaki in 1945. &quot;Creating a simple atomic bomb, as the United States did during the Manhattan Project, would not be a difficult task 80 years later,&quot; the document reads. The Foreign Ministry has previously denied media reports that Ukraine plans to develop its own weapons of mass destruction. Speculation about Ukraine&apos;s nuclear options increased after President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 17 said that he told Trump in September that Ukraine must either join NATO or pursue nuclear capabilities for the country&apos;s protection. Zelensky later walked back the comments, saying that Kyiv is not pursuing nuclear weapons and the remarks were made to emphasize the failures of the Budapest Memorandum. Under the 1994 agreement, Ukraine willingly surrendered its nuclear arsenal in exchange for receiving security guarantees from the U.S., the U.K., and Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-foreign-ministry-responds-to-rumors-of-kyivs-potential-to-build-nuclear-bomb/	2024-11-13T17:14:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166117330.jpg
Donald Trump tells New York Post he and Biden discussed Ukraine war at DC meeting	President-elect Donald Trump told The New York Post on Nov. 13 that he and President Joe Biden discussed the war in Ukraine during their historic post-election meeting in the Oval Office. &quot;We really had a really good meeting,&quot; Trump said, adding that both men &quot;enjoyed seeing each other&quot; and had a productive conversation. &quot;It&#x2019;s been a lot of work on both sides, and he did a very good job with respect to campaigning and everything else,&quot; Trump said, according to the outlet. He described Biden as &quot;very gracious,&quot; noting that &quot;We got to know each other again.&quot; Trump&#x2019;s support for Ukraine hangs in the air as analysts and politicians try to gauge his plans to bring peace to Ukraine, as he promised to end the war within &quot;24 hours&quot; after reelection without revealing details.

In the meeting, Trump and Biden discussed the transition of power, with Trump assuring the press on Jan. 20 that it would be &quot;as smooth as can be,&quot; despite his earlier attempts to contest the 2020 election results, which led to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. He also mentioned the &quot;very, very good relationship&quot; between the Republican transition team and the Biden White House. Trump revealed that their conversation included not only Ukraine but also the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. &quot;I wanted &#x2014; I asked for his views and he gave them to me,&quot; Trump said. &#x201C;Also, we talked very much about the Middle East, likewise. I wanted to know his views on where we are and what he thinks. And he gave them to me, he was very gracious.&quot; Trump also shared that he and Biden are expected to meet again just before his inauguration, which Biden has already indicated he will attend.	https://kyivindependent.com/donald-trump-tells-new-york-post-he-and-biden-discussed-ukraine-war-at-dc-meeting/	2024-11-13T15:10:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183897067.jpg
Trump nominates loyal backer Matt Gaetz as attorney general	President-elect Donald Trump announced Republican U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz as his nominee for attorney general, as he moves quickly to form his Cabinet. &quot;Matt will end Weaponized Government, protect our Borders, dismantle Criminal Organizations and restore Americans&#x2019; badly-shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department,&quot; Trump said in a statement about the nomination on X. Gaetz&apos;s selection will need further confirmation by the Republican-controlled Senate. Gaetz replied that &quot;It will be an honor to serve as President Trump&#x2019;s Attorney General!&quot; According to Trump&#x2019;s advisers, The attorney general is regarded as the most critical member of the administration after Trump himself, essential for executing mass deportations, pardoning Jan. 6 rioters, and pursuing retribution against those who have prosecuted him over the past four years. During his first term, Trump grew frustrated with what he viewed as an uncooperative Justice Department, including attorneys general Jeff Sessions, who allowed an investigation into potential 2016 campaign ties to Russia, and Bill Barr, who publicly contradicted Trump&#x2019;s false claims of fraud in the 2020 election. A bipartisan committee on Capitol Hill has been investigating Gaetz over longstanding allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use, and other potential ethical violations, the committee announced in June. The House ethics committee, which is composed of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans, reignited public attention on the scandal surrounding Gaetz, which had quieted after a previous criminal investigation into similar allegations was dropped. In its statement, the committee noted that it had interviewed dozens of witnesses, issued 25 subpoenas, and reviewed thousands of pages of documents as part of the extensive investigation into Gaetz&#x2019;s behavior, which originally began in April 2021. Gaetz has also consistently opposed additional aid to Ukraine and has been vocal about redirecting such funds to domestic priorities, particularly border security. Earlier this spring, Gaetz proposed an amendment to the Ukraine aid bill that would redirect any funds the U.S. might recover from Ukraine toward building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border&#x2014;a longstanding objective of President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-nominates-loyal-backer-matt-gaetz-as-attorney-general/	2024-11-13T14:36:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2170592053.jpg
Trump taps Ukraine-skeptic Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence	President-elect Trump announced on Nov. 13 that Tulsi Gabbard would take on the role of director of national intelligence, marking a notable shift for the former Democrat who has opposed U.S. support for Ukraine and had previously been accused of promoting Russian narratives. &quot;For over two decades, Tulsi has fought for our Country and the Freedoms of all Americans. As a former Candidate for the Democrat Presidential Nomination, she has broad support in both Parties - She is now a proud Republican!&quot; Trump said in a statement announcing Gabbard&#x2019;s selection. &quot;I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our Constitutional Rights, and securing Peace through Strength.&quot; Gabbard, a veteran of the Army National Guard, ran unsuccessfully for president as a Democrat in 2020 but announced her departure from the Democratic Party in 2022. She later campaigned alongside Trump and was part of his transition team. In early 2022, she echoed Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s justification for the invasion of Ukraine, attributing the cause not to Moscow but to the Biden administration&apos;s failure to acknowledge &quot;Russia&#x2019;s legitimate security concerns.&quot; &quot;This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden Admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia&#x2019;s legitimate security concerns regarding Ukraine&#x2019;s becoming a member of NATO, which would mean US/NATO forces right on Russia&#x2019;s border,&quot; Gabbard wrote on X. Gabbard also claimed that the U.S. is fueling a proxy war with Russia that could lead to a &quot;forever war.&quot; A 2022 report by The Intercept highligthed that in the days leading up to the 2022 invasion, Russian news reports have featured translated clips of Tucker Carlson, a conservative political commentator, or his guest Gabbard attacking the Biden administration. After Russia launched its military assault on Ukraine, Gabbard posted the video of her Fox News comments about U.S. sanctions against Russia on Twitter (now X) and suggested, without evidence, that &quot;doing anything to press Putin to stop the invasion of Ukraine could lead to a nuclear war.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-taps-ukraine-skeptic-tulsi-gabbard-for-director-of-national-intelligence/	2024-11-13T13:40:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182701925.jpg
Ousted by Merkel, potential Chancellor Friedrich Merz is looking to fix the country she broke	For the second time in his life, Friedrich Merz is a step away from taking charge of Germany. Losing the fight to control the Christian Democratic Union in 2002 to future Chancellor Angela Merkel and forced to retire from politics a few years later, Merz is now the frontrunner to lead the Union back into government. With Germany&apos;s ruling center-left coalition in tatters, Ukraine&apos;s leading European backer is heading toward snap elections set for Feb. 23. And it&apos;s all but certain that Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat, will lose his post as a result. The domestic turmoil comes at a critical moment for Ukraine as Russia holds the upper hand on the battlefield, and Donald Trump&apos;s imminent return to the White House may lead to a decreased U.S. involvement in the war. Yet, not all is grim for Kyiv. Polls predict a sweeping victory for the center-right Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU), whose leader Merz seems ready to ditch Scholz&apos;s cautious Ukraine strategy. Merz has called for an ultimatum to Moscow after which Ukraine could receive the much-desired Taurus missiles, powerful weapons that Scholz refused to provide. He also urged Europe to take up leadership in the pro-Kyiv coalition amid uncertainty about Trump&apos;s presidency. For that, the 69-year-old conservative has his work cut out for him. With a real possibility of a U.S. withdrawal, rising Ukraine-skeptic parties in Germany on the left and right, and an increasingly tight budget, Merz must cross a string of obstacles to deliver on his plans. &quot;Even an outspoken Merz and a strong CDU/CSU showing in the next elections will not be able to defy gravity when it comes to providing Ukraine with additional military capabilities, defense-industrial capacity, and budgetary support,&quot; Jorn Fleck, senior director with the Europe Center at the Atlantic Council, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Germany&apos;s capacity on all three is lagging and shifting the needle in all these areas &#x2014; more kit, more ammo, more macro-financial assistance &#x2014; &#xA0;is measured in years, not weeks or months.&quot; But for Merz, whose main rival Merkel has pushed the country into a painful dependence on Russia, solving the problems ultimately created by the former chancellor&apos;s policies is worth the fight. The coalition of Scholz&apos;s Social Democratic Party (SPD), the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), and The Greens fell apart on Nov. 6 after the chancellor dismissed Finance Minister Christian Lindner, the FDP leader. Scholz and Lindner were at odds on nearly all questions concerning the way to handle the staggering budget deficit and the country&apos;s vast economic problems. According to Lindner, however, the final nail in the coffin of mounting disputes was the ex-finance minister&apos;s proposal to send Ukraine Taurus missiles instead of an additional 3 billion euros ($3.2 billion) in military aid requested by Scholz. The chancellor now leads a minority government and will have to seek Merz&apos;s party support to pass the budget. While the government&apos;s dramatic collapse sparked some concern about the flow of support from Europe&apos;s largest military donor, arms for Ukraine seem to be safe at the moment. Both Scholz and Merz agree to provide Kyiv with the necessary aid. Germany allocated around 8 billion euros in military aid to Ukraine in 2024. The federal budget for 2025 contains only half of that, with Berlin hoping that the G7 loan can cover additional assistance. &quot;The previously planned and initiated support for Ukraine can continue without restriction,&quot; and additional aid can be theoretically approved under provisional budget management, said Michael Wustmann, a research assistant to German lawmaker Sebastian Sch&#xE4;fer, who sits on Bundestag&apos;s budget committee. But Germany heads towards months of political wrangling that will keep its leaders distracted from Ukraine. Even if Merz&apos;s CDU/CSU secures the expected victory, difficult coalition negotiations are likely to follow. &quot;Germany will be preoccupied with itself until the election and then for another four to six months, depending on how long it takes to form a coalition,&quot; says Martin Bialecki, editor-in-chief of the journals Internationale Politik (IP) and Internationale Politik Quarterly (IPQ). &quot;There will be no momentum, no leadership in Europe, and also no reaching out to France, Poland, and the U.K., which is so urgently needed. And all this before (and after) Trump takes office, under whom freezing of the war would be the most likely scenario,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. Merz, a former corporate lawyer and multimillionaire representing CDU/CSU&apos;s right wing is the most likely candidate to enter the chancellery early next year. His party currently enjoys the support of 32% of Germans, more than the entire ruling coalition combined. Ascending to the party leadership in early 2022, Merz presents a sharp break from the 16-year era of his centrist predecessor, Merkel, who ruled Germany from 2005 until 2021. Merkel&apos;s legacy has been tainted by Germany&apos;s deepened energy dependence on Russia and the neglect of the Bundeswehr, the country&apos;s military. In contrast, her main critic within the CDU/CSU Merz has called on Europe to stand up decisively to Russian aggression and pledged to maintain defense spending above 2% of GDP, as per NATO&apos;s requirements.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Germany expects to hit the 2% threshold in 2024 for the first time in three decades, though its ability to maintain this level remains in question. In a recent op-ed, Merz also rejected Scholz&apos;s policy of caution as a &quot;desperate hope of being able to portray himself as a &apos;peace chancellor&apos;&quot; while urging Europe to assert leadership in aiding Ukraine. &quot;I believe Merz thinks more &apos;European&apos; than is currently apparent&#x2026; Among the many mistakes Scholz has made, his lack of interest in Europe is one of the more consequential,&quot; Bialecki said. The CDU/CSU leader addressed the most widely discussed subject to highlight his differences with the incumbent chancellor: the Taurus missiles. Lawmakers from Merz&apos;s party have repeatedly urged the government to provide Ukraine with the following cruise missiles, which can strike targets at a distance of 500 kilometers (300 miles). Scholz has been adamant, however, fearing such a move could draw Berlin into the war. &quot;The delivery of Taurus is anything but an entry into war,&quot; Merz said last month on the ARD television channel. In an interview with the Stern magazine, Merz proposed giving Russian President Vladimir Putin an ultimatum &#x2014; if he does not stop his war within 24 hours, Kyiv&apos;s partners would lift restrictions on long-range strikes. If even that step is not sufficient, Germany would deliver Taurus missiles a week later. Ukraine&apos;s military currently operates long-range missiles like SCALP/Storm Shadow and ATACMS provided by the U.S., the U.K., and France but is not allowed to use them against targets on Russian soil. Under Merz&apos;s helm, &quot;Kyiv could expect more vocal and decisive messaging&#x2026; on why Germany should see it in its vital national interest that Ukraine succeeds,&quot; Fleck commented. &quot;Making the case to the German public will be crucial if Berlin is to sustain its support for Ukraine in the long term, and such public diplomacy at home is where the outgoing government failed significantly.&quot; The question remains to what extent Merz&apos;s rhetoric will transform into real steps beyond the electoral campaign. Whoever becomes chancellor in 2025 will face serious obstacles, namely the economic downturn and budget constraints. &quot;Merz maintains the CDU/CSU&apos;s key tenet, which is upholding the debt brake,&quot; said Zuzana Zavadilova, a Germany researcher at the Prague-based Association for International Affairs think tank. The opposition leader &quot;has called for an enormous defense budget hike, but it remains unclear how it will be funded without increasing the debt.&quot; Another challenge is the growing support for Ukraine-skeptic parties like the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) or the left-populist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW). Some AfD members are under investigation for allegedly taking money from Russian agents, while Wagenknecht sought to leverage her success in regional elections to undermine support for Ukraine. Merz has previously said that a pro-NATO, pro-Kyiv course is non-negotiable in any coalition talks.

(Alexandra Beier/Getty Images)But the rising support for BSW and the AfD signals a growing Ukraine fatigue in Germany, with some hesitant voices growing louder also within the CDU itself, said Jakub Eberle, a senior researcher at the Institute of International Relations Prague. A recent poll showed that the popular support for German military aid for Ukraine has dropped from 66% to 57% compared to last year, while 43% of respondents said that Kyiv should cede territory to achieve peace. The question of a post-election coalition remains open. Some prominent CDU/CSU leaders have rejected an alliance with decisively pro-Ukraine Greens, while the FDP may struggle to even cross the 5% threshold to enter parliament. Paradoxically, the SPD now appears to be Merz&apos;s most likely coalition partner, &quot;which puts additional constraints on any significant moves away from the status quo,&quot; Eberle told the Kyiv Independent. The expert also raised doubts about how feasible Merz&apos;s aim of an independent European leadership is: &quot;The position of the Trump administration will have a way larger impact on Germany&apos;s policies than whether the next German chancellor will be Friedrich Merz, Olaf Scholz, or any other of the probable candidates.&quot; While it may be more decisive in some concrete issues like Taurus missiles, Merz&apos;s government will likely &quot;stick with Germany&apos;s current policies (of) steady support of Ukraine with both military and financial assistance, but probably also the reluctance to move in much quicker or decisive manner,&quot; Eberle concluded.	https://kyivindependent.com/ousted-by-merkel-potential-chancellor-friedrich-merz-is-looking-to-fix-the-country-she-broke/	2024-11-13T12:43:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2170614252.jpg
Republican party secures House of Representatives in election clean sweep	The Republican Party has managed to maintain control of the U.S. House of Representatives, unofficial results show, securing the required 218 out of 435 seats in the chamber according to projections published by CNN on Nov. 13. With a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump would be able to promptly appoint his Cabinet and other key administration officials, facilitating the advancement of his agenda for at least the next two years. However, Democrats, holding narrow majorities in both the House and Senate, would still maintain some influence. On the same day, President-elect Donald Trump reportedly endorsed sitting House Speaker Mike Johnson to retain his position. Johnson will still need to secure 218 votes on the House floor on the first day of the new Congress to win his first full term as speaker. &quot;If there&#x2019;s unified government &#x2026; &#xA0;if we have a bicameral approach &#x2014; Republicans in both chambers working together to develop that agenda and implement it, and President Trump is guiding the way &#x2014; I think you will certainly have a lot less dissension in the ranks on our side,&quot; Johnson said in an interview with NBC News at a Pennsylvania campaign stop before the election. Republicans most recently gained control of the House in the 2022 midterm elections securing 222 of the 435 seats in the chamber. With these results, since the year 2000, Republicans have managed to secure control of the House in nine of the last 13 sessions of congress. Facing pressures from the far-right wing of his party, including from former president and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Johnson has at times been skeptical of providing U.S. support for Ukraine. In early 2024, Johnson led House Republicans in blocking a $61 billion aid package for Ukraine, arguing that domestic immigration policies at the U.S.-Mexico border should instead be prioritized. Following concessions from Johnson and fellow House Republicans after repeatedly being pressured by U.S. and Ukrainian government officials, the aid package was approved by the House in April 2024. A total 101 Republican House members voted in favor of the Ukraine aid bill, 112 voted against, and one voted present. Meanwhile, among Democrats, 210 House members voted yes, with none opposing the bill. Some of the most outspoken Republican opponents of U.S. aid for Ukraine, such as Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who won re-election on Nov. 5, have categorically said they will not vote for any future funding for Ukraine. Coming together with Republican victory in the Senate and the presidency itself, the House win cements a commanding mandate for President-elect Trump&apos;s second term.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-house-results/	2024-11-13T12:21:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/main-27.jpeg
Ukraine war latest: Trump to appoint Ukrainian peace envoy 'soon' to lead talks on ending war with Russia	Key developments on Nov. 13: President-elect Donald Trump may &quot;soon&quot; appoint a Ukrainian peace envoy to lead negotiations on ending Russia&apos;s war, Fox News reported on Nov. 13, citing its multiple undisclosed sources. &quot;You&apos;re going to see a very senior special envoy, someone with a lot of credibility, who will be given a task to find a resolution, to get to a peace settlement,&quot; one of the sources said, adding that the appointment will happen &quot;in short order.&quot; Kurt Volker held a similar position and served as the U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine on a volunteer basis from 2017 to 2019. The post of Ukrainian peace envoy is also expected to be unpaid. Over the past few days, Trump has announced new members of his future administration. Meanwhile, some of Trump&apos;s picks have made controversial statements about the war in Ukraine and opposed further provision of military aid for Kyiv. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 12 selected Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the &quot;Department of Government Efficiency,&quot; a new body designed to &quot;drive large-scale structural reform.&quot; Ramaswamy, a wealthy entrepreneur, and Musk, one of the world&apos;s richest people and owner of SpaceX, Tesla, and X (formerly known as Twitter), have no background in politics apart from Ramaswamy&#x2019;s brief running for the Republican presidential nomination. While Musk has repeatedly echoed pro-Russian talking points on Ukraine, including proposals to cede territory to Moscow, Ramaswamy was among the most vocal opponents of military aid for Kyiv. Trump also named South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as the leader of Homeland Security, who earlier called Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine &quot;Europe&apos;s fight, not ours.&quot; Earlier, Trump named Michael Waltz his national security advisor. Waltz&apos;s views on Ukraine evolved from an ardent supporter of U.S. military aid to questioning it and advocating for relocating these resources against China. Trump&apos;s defense secretary is confirmed to be Pete Hegseth, an army veteran and current Fox News host. His secretary of state, overseeing U.S. diplomacy, is reported to be Marco Rubio. Ukraine will receive the sixth German IRIS-T air defense system by the end of the year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 13 after a call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Ukraine has lobbied international partners for more air defense capabilities in the wake of intensifying Russian strikes targeting energy infrastructure. Germany ordered an additional 17 IRIS-T air defense systems for Ukraine, Scholz said on Sept. 4. Berlin handed over the most recent IRIS-T system to Kyiv in early October. During the call, Zelensky and Scholz discussed further cooperation in the defense sector, particularly the volume of air defense supplies for the next year and possible additional assistance with air defense systems from Germany. The counterparts also agreed that the meetings of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, also known as the Ramstein format, should be maintained, the Presidential Office&apos;s statement read. Zelensky also said that Ukraine&apos;s vision of a just and lasting peace should be presented at the Group of Twenty (G20) meeting in Brazil and thanked Germany for its support. Initially a hesitant partner, Berlin has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. However, Scholz is still reluctant to supply some key capabilities, namely Taurus long-range missiles. Russian President Vladimir Putin approved on Nov. 13 a reduction in compensation for wounded soldiers participating in the war against Ukraine. The current maximum amount of compensation is 3 million rubles (nearly $29,000), but the severity of the injury is not considered for its allocation. The change approved by Putin classifies injuries into three categories. The payment for a &quot;severe&quot; injury is 3 million rubles (nearly $29,000), and for a &quot;minor&quot; injury, 1 million rubles (nearly $10,000). For &quot;other minor injuries,&quot; soldiers will receive compensation of 100,000 rubles ($960), according to Russian state news agency TASS. The decree signed by Putin does not specify how the severity of a given injury is classified. Deputy Defense Minister Anna Tsivileva said at a meeting with the ministry&apos;s head, Andrei Belousov, on Nov. 13 that the current rules on payments for injuries create a &quot;sense of distortion&quot; among the soldiers. In October, Russian forces in Ukraine suffered their deadliest month since the start of the full-scale invasion. U.K. Defense Minister John Healey said that Moscow&apos;s troops suffered 41,980 killed and wounded during October, according to British defense intelligence figures. While Russian forces are suffering record losses, they&apos;re also making increasingly swift gains in the east of Ukraine. According to a Bloomberg analysis published on Nov. 1, Ukraine has lost 1,146 square kilometers of its own territory since the launch of the Kursk Oblast incursion in early August, with the week up until Nov. 1 reported as the worst in terms of lost territory in all of 2024. Meanwhile, Russia encourages its citizens to sign contracts with the army, offering financial benefits. Instead of ordering a new wave of conscription, Putin ordered an increase in the sign-on bonus for new military recruits to serve in Ukraine to 400,000 rubles (over $4,600), effectively doubling the lump-sum payment of 195,000 ($2,260) rubles initially promised to recruits in September 2022. Belgorod Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov announced on Oct. 7 that residents in the region will be paid a nationwide record 3 million rubles (about $31,200) through a one-time signing bonus for joining the military. The additional payments are in line with efforts by Russian officials to entice more citizens to join the military as the country seeks to replenish its military, decimated by high losses in Ukraine. Military donations in Ukraine have fallen sharply amid rising financial pressures and war weariness, with major charities reporting drops by 20% or more in 2024, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 13. Prominent organizations such as Come Back Alive and the Serhiy Prytula Foundation, headed by the well-known Ukrainian TV personality of the same name, have seen contributions decrease by approximately one-fifth in 2024, Bloomberg reported. Other groups supporting the Armed Forces report even steeper declines. While these charities provide essential support, they cover only a fraction of Ukraine&#x2019;s total military needs. In 2024, Prytula&#x2019;s foundation raised Hr 1.4 billion ($34 million), a figure that pales in comparison to Ukraine&#x2019;s $50 billion military budget. Come Back Alive, one of Ukraine&apos;s largest charitable foundations, reported a 15% drop in donations in the same year, based on its reports on the receipt of donations. Meanwhile, Reactive Post, another non-governmental organization, told Bloomberg that its contributions have decreased by over 40% this year compared to the same period in 2023. Prytula cited economic challenges and the hardships brought on by power outages as likely reasons for the downturn. In an interview with Ukrainska Pravda, Taras Chmut, the head of Come Back Alive, expressed concern over 2024&#x2019;s fundraising efforts, saying they &quot;have not started as well as we would like.&quot; Chmut explained that as more Ukrainians leave the country, incomes decline, and living costs rise, donations are inevitably impacted. Oleh Karpenko, the head of partnerships at Come Back Alive, told the BBC that donation patterns vary based on events such as shelling in Ukraine, drone strikes in Russia, power outages, battlefield developments, and military successes or setbacks. On Oct. 25, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced a new eSupport initiative scheduled to launch on Dec. 1. Under this program, each Ukrainian will receive Hr 1,000 ($24) in aid, which can be used for specific expenses. Deputy Economy Minister Oleksii Soboliev clarified that these funds could be redirected to the military through donations, even if foreign aid itself cannot be directly allocated for military purposes, as reported by the NV news outlet.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-trump-to-appoint-ukrainian-peace-envoy-soon-to-lead-talks-on-ending-war-with-russia/	2024-11-13T12:11:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182677887.jpg
MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak: Developments in Ukraine’s parliament on economic reforms, international obligations — Issue 81	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 81 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief&#x201D; newsletter, covering events from Nov. 4-10, 2024. The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. The 2025 state budget could be at risk as draft law on tax increase still hasn&#x2019;t come into force. Last week the Cabinet of Ministers submitted draft law #12000 on the 2025 State Budget for the second reading. It has to be adopted in the second reading by Nov. 20. The revised text includes Hr 120 billion ($2.9 billion) in expenses which are expected to be covered by tax increase. However, the draft law on a tax increase still hasn&#x2019;t been signed by President Volodymyr Zelensky. It creates certain risks that the Cabinet will be forced to cut military expenses, raise internal borrowings or look for other sources to cover this budget gap. The Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, will consider the draft law on the 2025 State Budget in the second reading next week. Ukraine ensured an opportunity meeting one of Ukraine Facility requirements. The mandate of the Public Council of International Experts which will check candidates to the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) has been prolonged. The president signed the relevant draft law to ensure an opportunity to finish the ongoing selection process of new HACC judges. The latter is among obligations of the Ukraine Plane for the 1st quarter 2025. Meetings of the parliament are scheduled for next week. The next meetings of the Verkhovna Rada are scheduled for Nov. 19-22. Among other issues, the parliament will consider draft law #12131 on resuming monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in the first reading. Resignation of the Ukrenergo supervisory board results in technical default of the SOE. Ukrenergo suspended eurobond payments for $825 million as the planned debt restructuring hasn&#x2019;t been completed yet. The company can&#x2019;t complete the restructuring process until a new supervisory board is formed. This step is required as two independent members of the previous supervisory board resigned due to disagreement with the dismissal of Ukrenergo ex-Head, calling this decision a political one.	https://kyivindependent.com/mp-yaroslav-zhelezniak-developments-in-ukraines-parliament-on-economic-reforms-international-obligations-issue-81/	2024-11-13T12:10:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170188731.jpg
Trump's administration picks – what do they mean for Ukraine?	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s first team picks have both positive and negative implications for Ukraine, with Kyiv left guessing what kind of policy they will pursue, according to Ukrainian and Western analysts. Some appointments seem to lean in Kyiv&#x2019;s favor, while others hint at a more Moscow-friendly stance. Analysts say that Trump has assembled a team of China hawks focused primarily on countering Beijing, which they see as the main economic and military threat to the U.S. They are less concerned with opposing Russia and view its war against Ukraine as a distraction from China. &quot;These are not the best choices (for Ukraine) but not the worst either,&quot; Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko told the Kyiv Independent. On Nov. 12, Trump chose Peter Hegseth, a conservative talk show host on Fox News, as his defense secretary. The move prompted concerns in Kyiv because Hegseth is an isolationist who has called for reducing the U.S. commitment to the NATO military alliance. On the same day, Trump also picked billionaire Elon Musk and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy to run a new Department of Government Efficiency. The department, which is supposed to cut bureaucracy and reduce regulation, will &#x201C;provide advice and guidance from outside of government,&#x201D; Trump said. Ramaswamy has made statements highly critical of Ukraine. Musk has prompted controversy by suggesting that Ukraine cede the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula to Russia and agree to a vote on the status of other occupied territories accounting for some 20% of state territory. However, it is not clear if Ramaswamy and Musk will have any influence on Trump&#x2019;s foreign policy. The decisions on Hegseth, Ramaswamy, and Musk were preceded by Trump&apos;s announcement on Nov. 9 that ex-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley would not join his team. Pompeo and Haley are among the most pro-Ukrainian Republicans, and analysts say that Trump&apos;s decision not to hire them may point in the direction of a more Kremlin-friendly policy and a peace deal on Russia&apos;s terms. Trump&#x2019;s other decisions are seen as less negative for Ukraine. He said on Nov. 12 that Michael Waltz would be appointed as his national security advisor. Reuters and other media also reported on Nov. 12 that Trump was expected to appoint Marco Rubio as secretary of state but this decision has not been officially announced yet. Some commentators described Rubio and Waltz as more pro-Ukrainian and hawkish on Russia than other Trumpists. Others warned, however, that their record on Ukraine has been ambiguous, and it has yet to be seen to what extent they will back Kyiv. &quot;(Rubio and Waltz understand) that the U.S.&apos; global position depends in part on its network of allies and partners, and on collaborating with them, which is good news for Ukraine,&quot; Charly Salonius-Pasternak, lead researcher at the Center on U.S. Politics and Power at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Both (Waltz and Rubio) do think Europe should spend more on its own defense and have become more skeptical of unlimited assistance to Ukraine&#x2026; so both Waltz and Rubio have aligned themselves more with Trump&#x2019;s policy ideas during the recent past. I think it&#x2019;s reasonable news for Ukraine, but doesn&#x2019;t change the overall picture,&quot; Salonius-Pasternak said. Trump&apos;s pick for defense secretary, Hegseth, is a co-host of Fox &amp; Friends Weekend, a talk show on the conservative TV channel Fox News. Hegseth previously served as an infantry captain in the Army National Guard and as the executive director of two veteran organizations, Vets for Freedom and Concerned Veterans for America. Hegseth&apos;s views on foreign policy and Ukraine in particular are controversial. He has defended Trump&apos;s statement made during the invasion of Ukraine that Russian President Vladimir Putin was &quot;savvy&quot; and a &quot;genius.&quot; Hegseth argued that Trump was solely trying to &quot;troll&quot; the media amid the coverage of the war. Hegseth has also stirred controversy by suggesting that Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion &quot;pales in comparison&quot; to &quot;wokeness&quot; &#x2014; a conservative pejorative term for left-wing ideology in the U.S. Pete Hegseth as Nick Lachey Visits &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; to discuss the &quot;American Kennel Club&quot; show at Fox News Channel Studios on Feb. 5, 2019, in New York City, U.S. (Roy Rochlin/Getty Images)He is also skeptical about the NATO military alliance. &quot;Why should America, the European &apos;emergency contact number&apos; for the past century, listen to self-righteous and impotent nations asking us to honor outdated and one-sided defense arrangements they no longer live up to?&quot; Hegseth wrote in his 2024 book titled &quot;The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.&quot; Unlike Rubio and Waltz, Hegseth is an outsider without any prior background in government. Fesenko, the Ukrainian political analyst, said that Trump&#x2019;s decision on Hegseth was &#x201C;surprising,&#x201D; adding that it&#x2019;s not clear what to expect from him. Musk, who will co-run the Department of Government&#x2019;s Efficiency, also has controversial views on Ukraine. Musk helped Ukraine in 2022 by providing Starlink satellite Internet terminals. But he prompted a scandal the same year by suggesting a peace plan that included Ukraine&apos;s neutral status, recognizing occupied Crimea as Russian, and holding a UN-supervised vote on the status of other occupied territories. Musk&#x2019;s portfolio will be focused on domestic policy. But Volodymyr Dubovyk, an expert on U.S.-Ukrainian relations and head of Odesa National University&apos;s Center for International Studies, argued that he could have considerable influence on foreign policy as well. Musk joined Trump&apos;s call with Zelensky on Nov. 6, CNN and the New York Times reported, citing their sources.

(Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images)Ramaswamy, Musk&#x2019;s future colleague at the Department of Government Efficiency, was a candidate in the Republican primaries for the 2024 presidential election. He has made a number of virulently anti-Ukrainian statements. &quot;Joe Biden needs to man up to his bully-friend (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky and clearly state that we are dead-set opposed to the Ukrainian admission to NATO,&#x201D; Ramaswamy wrote on X in 2023. &#x201C;This should be a hard red line.&#x201D; In another attack on Zelensky, he said that, if elected president, he would &#x201C;refuse to be bullied by an anti-democratic comedian-turned-leader and it&#x2019;s truly mystifying to me that the rest of the West is eating out of this Pied Piper&#x2019;s hand every day.&#x201D; Trump&apos;s decisions on Ramaswamy, Musk, and Hegseth mean that &quot;all policy will be under the White House&apos;s direct control,&quot; Dubovyk said. &quot;All of them are loyal to Trump,&quot; he added. Trump&apos;s Nov. 11 decision to nominate U.S. Representative Elise Stefanik as ambassador to the UN has also triggered concerns because she voted against a $61 billion aid package for Ukraine in April. A group of Republicans blocked U.S. military aid for Ukraine for half a year from late 2023 to early 2024, hampering Ukraine&#x2019;s defense. Trump&#x2019;s other personnel decisions are seen in a more positive light. Tymofiy Mylovanov, president of the Kyiv School of Economics and former advisor to Zelensky&#x2019;s office, wrote on X on Nov. 12 that both Rubio and Waltz were &quot;good for Ukraine,&#x201D; adding that Waltz had called for stepping up support for Kyiv. Peter Rough, director of the Center on Europe and Eurasia at the conservative Hudson Institute, told the Kyiv Independent that Rubio and Waltz were &quot;foreign policy professionals of the highest order&quot; who &quot;will defend U.S. interests vigorously, which requires a clear-eyed understanding of the threat posed by Russia.&quot; Daniel Kochis, a senior fellow in the Center on Europe and Eurasia at the Hudson Institute, told the Kyiv Independent that he &#x201C;wouldn&#x2019;t read the expected appointments of Rubio and Waltz as necessarily a bad sign for Ukraine.&#x201D; &quot;The appointment of Rubio in particular may bode well&quot; for Ukraine, he said. Others were more skeptical about Trump&apos;s first picks. &quot;I would not read too much into Trump&#x2019;s picks for specific posts,&quot; Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Unlike during his first term, when he to some extent followed the advice of his more experienced advisers, in his second term, I expect Trump to call the shots. He is picking people that he believes will be loyal and follow the leader.&quot; Waltz, Trump&apos;s pick for national security advisor, is a congressman from Florida and a retired Army Green Beret. His views on Ukraine have changed since 2022. In 2022, he called on Biden&apos;s administration to provide more weapons to Kyiv and argued that the majority of the Republican caucus supported U.S. assistance to Ukraine amid concerns that they could block aid. &#x201C;I think the vast majority of the conference realizes that we either pay now or pay later, that Russian President Vladimir Putin fully intends, if he takes Ukraine, to move on to NATO-allied countries like the Baltics, Poland, and Finland,&#x201D; he said. In this July 15th photo Rep. Mike Waltz speaks on the first day of the Republican National Convention at the Fiserv Forum on July 15, 2024 in Milwaukee, (Leon Neal/Getty Images)However, in October 2024, Waltz said that there must be a reassessment of the United States&#x2019; aims in Ukraine. &#x201C;Is (involvement in Ukraine) in America&#x2019;s interest, are we going to put in the time, the treasure, the resources that we need in the Pacific right now badly?&#x201D; Waltz asked. Waltz is one of the leading U.S. critics of China, with Trump and his allies focusing more on opposing China than the Kremlin. &quot;The Trump-aligned foreign policy world has been hyper-focused on China and defense policy, as well as reducing U.S. commitments to NATO,&quot; Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;There is not a prominent Russia hand that I can think of in his orbit. Russia policy has not been a focus at all. As for Ukraine, there is some sympathy but it is also seen as a distraction from the China focus and there is a general desire to shift responsibility for supporting Ukraine to Europe.&quot; Dubovyk said that Waltz &quot;has both expressed support for Ukraine and voiced doubts about continuing it.&#x201D; &quot;I think we&#x2019;ll also need to wait and see which sentiments prevail overall in the White House, as Waltz could go either way regarding Ukraine,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. Oleksandr Kraiev, head of the North America program at the Ukrainian Prism think-tank, also said that it was difficult to say to what extent Waltz would support Ukraine. He told the Kyiv Independent that Waltz was seen as a staunch Trump loyalist. Rubio, a senator from Florida and a Republican candidate in the 2016 presidential election, initially condemned Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine and supported its efforts to push back Russian troops. However, in April, he voted against the $61 billion aid package for Ukraine passed by Congress. Kochis emphasized that, according to Rubio, he voted against the bill due to a lack of compromise with Biden on immigration, not due to his opposition to support for Ukraine. In September, Rubio also called for achieving a peaceful settlement instead of helping Ukraine regain Russian-occupied territories. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not on Russia&#x2019;s side &#x2014; but, unfortunately, the reality of it is that the way the war in Ukraine is going to end is with a negotiated settlement,&#x201D; Rubio told NBC. Dubovyk and Kraiev said that Rubio is considered to be more pro-Ukrainian, compared to other Trump supporters. &quot;For us, it&apos;s a positive signal,&quot; Kraiev said. &quot;He has made statements supportive of Ukraine.&quot; Kraiev argued that Rubio, who criticized Trump in the Republican primaries, is seen as independent and is not a Trumpist &quot;fanatic.&quot; However, according to Dubovyk, he will likely coordinate his actions with Trump&#x2019;s close allies. &quot;So he (Rubio) may not be one of those making key decisions,&quot; Dubovyk said. Ruth Deyermond, senior lecturer in post-Soviet security at King&apos;s College London, argued that, regardless of Rubio&apos;s possible appointment, Trump&apos;s administration &quot;seems likely to be dominated by individuals &#x2013; including the president and vice president &#x2013; who maintain positions so strongly favorable to the Kremlin.&quot; &quot;Even some of those individuals mentioned as possible picks who used to be very hawkish on Russia, such as Rubio, have changed their positions in recent years, aligning themselves much more with Trump,&quot; she told the Kyiv Independent.

Dorton Arena on November 04, 2024 in Raleigh, North Carolina (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Another Trump pick, John Ratcliffe, also has a mixed record. Ratcliffe, who is expected to become director of the CIA, was a Congressman from 2015 to 2020 and Trump&apos;s director of national intelligence from 2020 to 2021. Like Waltz, he is known as a China hawk. In 2020, Ratcliffe sparked controversy by declassifying Russian disinformation that Hillary Clinton had personally approved a scheme to associate Trump with Putin and the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee. In 2022, however, Ratcliffe was supportive of Ukraine and criticized the Biden administration for what he saw as its weak response to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Dubovyk described Ratcliffe as a Trump loyalist who has &#x201C;no independent political weight.&#x201D; Both Waltz and Rubio are seen as more ambiguous on Ukraine than Pompeo and Haley, who are among the most pro-Ukrainian Republicans, according to analysts. As a result, Trump&apos;s decision not to hire them has prompted concerns in Kyiv. Pompeo was a member of Trump&apos;s team during his first term: as head of the Central Intelligence Agency from 2017 to 2018 and as secretary of state from 2018 to 2021. In July, Pompeo published an op-ed claiming that Trump would support Ukraine if elected. He suggested driving down energy prices to shrink &quot;Putin&#x2019;s war-crimes budget,&quot; imposing &#x201C;real&#x201D; sanctions on Russia, revitalizing NATO, creating &quot;a $500 billion lend-lease program for Ukraine,&quot; and lifting &quot;all restrictions on the type of weapons Ukraine can obtain and use.&quot; &quot;(Trump&apos;s) early disclosure that he does not intend to tap Haley or Pompeo suggests he will stay away from more hawkish Republicans,&quot; Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said. &quot;That news is hardly surprising given Trump&#x2019;s apparent determination to steer clear of the &apos;adults in the room&apos; that tried to tame his isolationist and unilateralist impulses during his first term.&quot; Former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks during the last day of the 2024 Republican National Convention at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on July 18, 2024.

(Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images) #forowenDeyermond agreed with this assessment. &quot;The announcement that Trump won&apos;t be appointing either Pompeo or Haley (together with H.R. McMaster, the strongest critics of Russia in the first Trump administration) is a confirmation of what was already obvious,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;The new Trump administration is likely to align much more with Russia than with the U.S. allies on Ukraine,&quot; he added. Commenting on Trump&apos;s decision not to appoint Pompeo and Haley, Bergmann said that &quot;few in his administration will want to prioritize or focus on Ukraine because of where Trump is on Russia.&quot; &quot;Any committed Russia hawks in the administration &#x2013; if there are any &#x2013; are unlikely to have much influence,&quot; he added. &quot;The challenge will be convincing Trump to ask Congress for more military aid to Ukraine.&quot; Meanwhile, Mykhailo Minakov, head of the Ukrainian Research Program at the Kennan Institute, said that he &quot;would have been surprised if (Pompeo and Haley) had been invited (to join Trump&apos;s team)&quot; because they &quot;strongly criticized Donald Trump and did not actively support him during his campaign.&quot; &quot;I think it&apos;s more personal than ideological,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-administration-picks-what-do-they-mean-for-ukraine/	2024-11-13T12:08:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183218031.jpg
Notorious Ukrainian judge temporarily suspended from justice administration	Former judge of the Kyiv District Administrative Court (OASK) Pavlo Vovk was temporarily suspended from the administration of justice on Nov. 13 after the decision of the High Council of Justice. The High Qualification Commission of Judges of Ukraine recognized Vovk as having failed to prove his ability to administer justice in the Administrative Court of Cassation within the Supreme Court earlier this year. Vovk&apos;s suspension will remain in effect until the High Council of Justice dismisses the judge or the Third Disciplinary Chamber of the body that suspended the judge reverses its decision, the statement read. The Third Disciplinary Chamber unanimously decided on Vovk&apos;s future dismissal, according to the Dejure Foundation. Vovk has become a symbol of injustice, lawlessness, and impunity in Ukraine. Cases against him have been blocked and sabotaged by prosecutors, investigators, and courts for several years. Vovk and other judges of his court have been charged with usurpation of power, obstruction of justice, organized crime, and abuse of authority. In December 2022, the parliament voted on liquidating the Kyiv District Administrative Court, whose chairman, Vovk, had previously been subject to U.S. personal sanctions. President Volodymyr Zelensky signed the document, making it effective.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-most-notorious-judge-temporarily-suspended-from-justice-administration/	2024-11-13T11:48:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/25299831_147735009333709_387239191894146183.jpg
6th German IRIS-T to arrive in Ukraine by end of 2024, Zelensky says	Ukraine will receive the sixth German IRIS-T air defense system by the end of the year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 13 after a call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Ukraine has lobbied international partners for more air defense capabilities in the wake of intensifying Russian strikes targeting energy infrastructure. Germany ordered an additional 17 IRIS-T air defense systems for Ukraine, Scholz said on Sept. 4. Berlin handed over the most recent IRIS-T system to Kyiv in early October. During the call, Zelensky and Scholz discussed further cooperation in the defense sector, particularly the volume of air defense supplies for the next year and possible additional assistance with air defense systems from Germany. The counterparts also agreed that the meetings of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, also known as the Ramstein format, should be maintained, the Presidential Office&apos;s statement read. Zelensky also said that Ukraine&apos;s vision of a just and lasting peace should be presented at the Group of Twenty (G20) meeting in Brazil and thanked Germany for its support. Initially a hesitant partner, Berlin has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. However, Scholz is still reluctant to supply some key capabilities, namely Taurus long-range missiles.	https://kyivindependent.com/6th-german-iris-t-to-arrive-in-ukraine-by-end-of-2024-zelensky-says/	2024-11-13T11:46:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169575198.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — Aid to Ukraine in an uncertain future	The following is the Nov. 12, 2024 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. As Donald Trump prepares to reenter the White House, the biggest question hanging over Ukraine is what his return means for future U.S. financial and military aid to Kyiv as it fights Russia&#x2019;s war. Trump has repeatedly said, without saying how, that he would end the war on day one of becoming president and criticized aid to Ukraine, calling President Volodymyr Zelensky a great &#x201C;salesman.&#x201D; His son, Donald Trump Jr., mocked aid to Ukraine on Instagram with an image of Zelensky and the caption: &quot;You&apos;re 38 days from losing your allowance.&quot; It is still uncertain what Trump will actually do to address Russia&#x2019;s ongoing invasion of Ukraine, and whether he will manage to end the war as quickly as he hopes remains to be seen. One thing is for certain: U.S. aid to Ukraine has been a lifeline that has allowed Ukraine to keep fighting and keep its economy afloat &#x2014; if Trump decides to block further aid to Ukraine and Kyiv&#x2019;s European allies also pull back, it could seriously threaten Ukraine&#x2019;s survival. Ukraine&#x2019;s government said earlier this year that it is predicting a budget deficit of 19% as defense spending remains high, leaving a hole of around $35 billion that will have to be filled by external financing. While more than half of that amount will come from the International Monetary Fund, the rest &#x2014; around $15 billion &#x2014; will likely need to be sourced from loans from G7 countries, Bloomberg earlier reported, citing officials close to the matter. As President Joe Biden&#x2019;s time in office runs out, Ukraine&#x2019;s allies on both sides of the Atlantic are urging him to act quickly to get Kyiv badly needed aid. The Telegraph reported on Nov. 12 that British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is preparing to press Biden to release $20 billion in funds that are part of a $50 billion loan agreed by G7 world leaders back in June, funded in part on the interest earned on Russian assets seized at the start of the full-scale invasion. Speaking of Russian assets &#x2014; no decision has been made on seizing the $300 billion in immobilized Russian Central Bank assets and getting them to Ukraine. Most of the assets are tied up in Europe where policymakers claim the risks are too high to make a move on confiscating them and releasing them to Kyiv. Biden&#x2019;s team has already announced it&#x2019;s going to appeal to Congress to approve more aid to Ukraine before his time is up and is reportedly moving to send Ukraine as much military aid as possible in the upcoming months. If Biden is interested in cementing his legacy as the president who showed up for Ukraine, the time is now. Passenger planes sit next to terminals at Kyiv Boryspil International Airport. (Boryspil International Airport/Facebook)Air travel could return early next yearUkraine is planning to reopen one airport by the end of January 2025, just shy of three years after all airports shuttered at the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Marsh McLennan Senior Partner Crispin Ellison said at the Kyiv International Economic Forum on Nov. 7. It is unknown exactly which airport will open first, but according to Ellison, the likely scenario is Lviv first, followed by Kyiv&#x2019;s Boryspil. Securing insurance for aviation will be easier if planes use Lviv Airport as it&apos;s close to the country&apos;s western border and far from the front lines, but President Volodymyr Zelensky insists that Boryspil International Airport be opened first, Ellison said. It&#x2019;s unclear why Zelensky is so dead set on Boryspil opening first. It&#x2019;s up to the Presidential Office to make the final decision on flights as it needs to take into account the security situation and the performance of Ukrainian air defenses. Given Russia has been attacking Kyiv and its suburbs, which includes Boryspil, with drones on a daily basis, it&#x2019;s hard to imagine the security situation would allow for air travel any time soon. &quot;What we need is a confirmation around the (air) defenses and the military situation, which allows regulatory sign-off,&quot; Ellison said.

Through its Brave1 initiative to spur defense tech development, the country has already attracted $25 million in investments from international investors, Fedorov said. By the end of the year, the figure may reach $50 million, according to the minister. International Monetary Fund (IMF) headquarters in Washington, D.C. on Sept. 17, 2024. (Valerie Plesch/picture alliance via Getty Images)IMF back in townThe International Monetary Fund has arrived in Kyiv to kick off its latest assessment of a four-year $15-billion loan program for Ukraine, which could allow for the release of another $1.1 billion tranche if the government has fulfilled its commitments under the program. &#x201C;The in-person mission to Kyiv ends on Nov. 18, with discussions expected to continue virtually thereafter,&#x201D; Priscilla Toffano, the IMF&#x2019;s resident representative in Ukraine, told Bloomberg. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, the IMF has released some $9.8 billion in loans to Kyiv &#x2014; the first time the fund has loaned to a country at war. There&#x2019;s one thing the IMF isn&#x2019;t too happy about and will likely raise in conversations &#x2014; why President Volodymyr Zelensky still hasn&#x2019;t signed a law passed last month on a tax increase &#x2014; a move the IMF is expecting from its borrower.

(Vertigo Games)Ukrainian Metro game series ventures into VRMetro Awakening, the fourth video game in the popular Ukrainian-born post-apocalyptic survival franchise set in Russia&#x2019;s underground subway, was released on Nov. 7 by the virtual reality (VR) company Vertigo Games. In what may be one of the few remaining public collaborations between Ukrainians and Russians in the creative industries, exiled Russian writer Dmitry Glukhovsky, whose novels formed the basis of the franchise, contributed to scripting this standalone prequel. Prior to the full-scale invasion, Ukraine was home to hundreds of video game companies and an estimated tens of thousands of Ukrainian video game developers. Though the war has disrupted the young and booming industry, many companies have continued their operations, including the globally successful GSC Game World, whose S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is set to release Nov. 20.

Ukraine reacts with optimism, worry after Trump taps top administration members	Ukrainians awoke on Nov. 13 to news that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump had tapped Fox News host Pete Hegseth as his defense secretary &#x2014; the most eyebrow-raising appointment announced so far by the incoming administration of Kyiv&#x2019;s top Western ally. Some in the U.S. expressed shock at the appointment of the 44-year-old veteran with little military leadership experience. But lawmakers and experts in Ukraine, a country dependent on foreign assistance in battling Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion now in its third year, reacted cautiously and looked for signs of optimism. Hegseth&#x2019;s appointment follows news that Trump plans to appoint Congressman Mike Waltz as National Security Advisor and, reportedly but not confirmed yet by Trump&#x2019;s team, Senator Marco Rubio as his next Secretary of State. Billionaire Elon Musk and wealthy entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy will head a new &quot;Department of Government Efficiency&quot; focused on government reforms, among other announcements. Following Trump&#x2019;s inauguration in January, appointees that require confirmation will take positions in the government if approved by U.S. legislators. Some positions, including national security advisor, do not require confirmation. Donald Trump watches as U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) speaks during a campaign rally at the J.S. Dorton Arena on November 04, 2024 in Raleigh, North Carolina (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)&quot;I am quite optimistic about Trump&#x2019;s recent appointments. First, some of these people have either a pro-Ukrainian or anti-Russian position,&quot; Andriy Lyubka, a writer and director of the Institute for Central European Strategy, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Secondly, in these chaotic, unmotivated appointments of people without professional political backgrounds, Trump is very similar to (President Volodymyr) Zelensky. They are both showmen, and I think that after a brief and unsuccessful attempt to get along with Putin, Trump will find in Zelensky a partner who is suitable for him and close in spirit.&quot; Zelensky rose to power in 2019, winning more than 70% of the vote after decades as a comedian and entertainer, while Trump was well-known as a TV personality and entrepreneur before his first election as U.S. president in 2016. Their relationship has been strained since Trump&#x2019;s first term when a 2019 phone call between the two led to Trump&#x2019;s impeachment over allegations he pressured Zelensky to investigate political rivals by withholding military aid. David Arakhamia, head of Zelensky&#x2019;s Servant of the People parliamentary group, told the Kyiv Independent he did not have enough information to assess Hegseth&#x2019;s appointment. However, the appointments of Rubio and Waltz provided &quot;moderate reasons for optimism&quot; in Ukraine, he added. One reason is that the lawmakers on both sides have already been in contact, Arakhamia said. &#x201C;Second, neither of these (politicians) are isolationists. But in the end, we have to understand that the main things will be decided personally by President Trump,&#x201D; he said. After Trump&#x2019;s election, Zelensky praised Trump&#x2019;s approach of &quot;peace through strength,&quot; saying, &quot;This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer.&quot; The biggest surprise among the recent appointments was Hegseth. He previously served as an infantry captain in the Army National Guard doing multiple tours of Afghanistan and Iraq but lacks significant military leadership experience. To become defense secretary, Hegseth must be confirmed by a majority in the Senate, which Trump&#x2019;s Republican Party will now hold following the elections. If confirmed, he will replace Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin after Trump&apos;s inauguration in January. His slim experience could make it challenging for him to pass the necessary 50% threshold. &quot;We have a bit of a wait-and-see&quot; to see how his positions toward Ukraine take shape &#x2014; as well as how long his term in office lasts, said Lada Roslycky, founder and managing partner of the Ukraine-focused defense and security consulting group Black Trident. &quot;We&apos;ve seen that Trump did fire his heads of department &#x2014; particularly the defense &#x2014; in the past. So how long he&apos;s actually going to be there, we don&apos;t know,&quot; she said. Former U.S. President Donald Trump holds a campaign rally at Lancaster Airport on November 03, 2024 in Lititz, Pennsylvania. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Overall, she said, Trump&#x2019;s messaging and appointees indicate that Ukraine will have to become more self-reliant and produce more of its own weapons. In the first weeks of the full-scale invasion, Hegseth called Russian President Vladimir Putin an &quot;authoritarian&quot; and criticized Biden for not providing weapons fast enough. &quot;What&#x2019;s at stake is repelling an authoritarian who basically is saying &apos;I want the Soviet Union back,&apos;&quot; Hegseth said on a March 7, 2022 Fox News broadcast. He added that the U.S. needed to be &quot;equipping and supplying Ukraine faster than we have.&quot; However, he has also stirred significant controversy with his comments about Ukraine and NATO. Just days after the full-scale invasion began, Hegseth described the war as &quot;important,&quot; but added, &quot;It pales in comparison to the crime I see in my streets, to the wokeness I see in my culture, to the inflation I see at my pocketbook, to the real border I care about, which is the southern border, which is wide open.&quot; He has also echoed Trump&#x2019;s skepticism toward NATO&#x2019;s mutual defense commitments. &quot;Why should America, the European &apos;emergency contact number&apos; for the past century, listen to self-righteous and impotent nations asking us to honor outdated and one-sided defense arrangements they no longer live up to?&quot; Hegseth wrote in a book released this year. Caught off-guard by the unexpected announcement, many Ukrainians are waiting to see how he will behave in office.

(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)&quot;It&#x2019;s hard to say now what kind of defense secretary he will be. I understand that one of the main criteria for Trump when he selects people for his administration is their loyalty, which is quite natural,&quot; said Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee in Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament. &quot;At the end of the day, what matters is how he will perform his functions and whether he will be an efficient defense secretary.&quot; Western analysts have noted that Trump&#x2019;s reported picks of Waltz and Rubio elevate two known China hawks to key foreign policy positions, signaling that future U.S. foreign policy may center on China. Serhii Fursa, the deputy managing director at Kyiv-based investment firm Dragon Capital, echoed views that the appointments announced so far &quot;sound better than expected for Ukraine.&quot; &quot;When we see appointments that are connected to external policies, it&apos;s not people who are known as Russian sympathizers,&quot; Fursa said. &quot;For us, the main problem is Musk&apos;s influence &#x2026; If he focuses on domestic U.S. problems instead of external policy, we will be very happy.&quot; Musk has repeatedly echoed pro-Russian talking points on Ukraine, including proposals to cede territory to Moscow. While his Starlink satellite company has played a crucial role in helping Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces, he has called to reduce aid to Ukraine and also reportedly has been communicating with Putin and other Kremlin officials since late 2022, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Responding to the appointment of Musk and Ramaswamy, Arakhamia told the Kyiv Independent, &quot;We will work with everyone.&quot; &quot;Once all the new appointees have access to intelligence reports and other classified material, I suppose a lot can change in their own assessments of the situation,&quot; Arakhamia added.

Putin cuts payments for wounded in war against Ukraine	Russian President Vladimir Putin approved on Nov. 13 a reduction in compensation for wounded soldiers participating in the war against Ukraine. The current maximum amount of compensation is 3 million rubles (nearly $29,000), but the severity of the injury is not considered for its allocation. The change approved by Putin classifies injuries into three categories. The payment for a &quot;severe&quot; injury is 3 million rubles (nearly $29,000), and for a &quot;minor&quot; injury, 1 million rubles (nearly $10,000). For &quot;other minor injuries,&quot; soldiers will receive compensation of 100,000 rubles ($960), according to Russian state news agency TASS. The decree signed by Putin does not specify how the severity of a given injury is classified. Deputy Defense Minister Anna Tsivileva said at a meeting with the ministry&apos;s head, Andrei Belousov, on Nov. 13 that the current rules on payments for injuries create a &quot;sense of distortion&quot; among the soldiers. In October, Russian forces in Ukraine suffered their deadliest month since the start of the full-scale invasion. U.K. Defense Minister John Healey said that Moscow&apos;s troops suffered 41,980 killed and wounded during October, according to British defense intelligence figures. While Russian forces are suffering record losses, they&apos;re also making increasingly swift gains in the east of Ukraine. According to a Bloomberg analysis published on Nov. 1, Ukraine has lost 1,146 square kilometers of its own territory since the launch of the Kursk Oblast incursion in early August, with the week up until Nov. 1 reported as the worst in terms of lost territory in all of 2024. Meanwhile, Russia encourages its citizens to sign contracts with the army, offering financial benefits. Instead of ordering a new wave of conscription, Putin ordered an increase in the sign-on bonus for new military recruits to serve in Ukraine to 400,000 rubles (over $4,600), effectively doubling the lump-sum payment of 195,000 ($2,260) rubles initially promised to recruits in September 2022. Belgorod Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov announced on Oct. 7 that residents in the region will be paid a nationwide record 3 million rubles (about $31,200) through a one-time signing bonus for joining the military. The additional payments are in line with efforts by Russian officials to entice more citizens to join the military as the country seeks to replenish its military, decimated by high losses in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-approves-reduction-of-payments-for-injured-in-war-against-ukraine/	2024-11-13T09:31:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2176697941.jpg
Trump to appoint Ukrainian peace envoy 'soon' to lead talks on ending war with Russia, Fox News reports	President-elect Donald Trump may &quot;soon&quot; appoint a Ukrainian peace envoy to lead negotiations on ending Russia&apos;s war, Fox News reported on Nov. 13, citing its multiple undisclosed sources. &quot;You&apos;re going to see a very senior special envoy, someone with a lot of credibility, who will be given a task to find a resolution, to get to a peace settlement,&quot; one of the sources said, adding that the appointment will happen &quot;in short order.&quot; Kurt Volker held a similar position and served as the U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine on a volunteer basis from 2017 to 2019. The post of Ukrainian peace envoy is also expected to be unpaid. Over the past few days, Trump has announced new members of his future administration. Meanwhile, some of Trump&apos;s picks have made controversial statements about the war in Ukraine and opposed further provision of military aid for Kyiv. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 12 selected Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the &quot;Department of Government Efficiency,&quot; a new body designed to &quot;drive large-scale structural reform.&quot; Ramaswamy, a wealthy entrepreneur, and Musk, one of the world&apos;s richest people and owner of SpaceX, Tesla, and X (formerly known as Twitter), have no background in politics apart from Ramaswamy&#x2019;s brief running for the Republican presidential nomination. While Musk has repeatedly echoed pro-Russian talking points on Ukraine, including proposals to cede territory to Moscow, Ramaswamy was among the most vocal opponents of military aid for Kyiv. Trump also named South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as the leader of Homeland Security, who earlier called Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine &quot;Europe&apos;s fight, not ours.&quot; Earlier, Trump named Michael Waltz his national security advisor. Waltz&apos;s views on Ukraine evolved from an ardent supporter of U.S. military aid to questioning it and advocating for relocating these resources against China. Trump&apos;s defense secretary is confirmed to be Pete Hegseth, an army veteran and current Fox News host. His secretary of state, overseeing U.S. diplomacy, is reported to be Marco Rubio.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-to-appoint-ukrainian-peace-envoy-soon-to-lead-talks-on-ending-war-with-russia-fox-news-reports/	2024-11-13T08:35:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183214747.jpg
Nearly 30 Russian airlines may go bankrupt in 2025, media reports	About thirty Russian airlines, accounting for 26% of domestic passenger traffic, may go bankrupt in 2025, Russia&apos;s Izvestia newspaper reported on Nov. 13. Since the full-scale invasion has begun, most Russian airlines came under Western sanctions. As a result, in 2022, several industry players stopped making lease payments. Russian airlines fear a deterioration in their financial condition and the revocation of their operator&apos;s certificates due to accumulated debts for leasing foreign aircraft, the media reported. In 2025, the government allowed the companies to write off their debts, but these amounts will be subject to a 25% income tax. This financial burden may force them to close their operations, according to Izvestia. Almost the entire fleet of Russian carriers was registered in Bermuda, Ireland, as well as other European countries, with monthly payments for a used Airbus A320s running up to around $80-150,000. Only major airlines, including Aeroflot, Ural Airlines, and S7 Airlines, were able to buy back leased aircraft with funds from the National Welfare Fund. In the first quarter of 2024, 165 out of 400 were repurchased. Since the written-off accounts payable are classified as &quot;non-operating income&quot; and the &quot;saved&quot; money is recognized as profit and taxed, this causes dissatisfaction among market participants, the media reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/nearly-30-russian-airlines-may-go-bankrupt-in-2025-media-reports/	2024-11-13T08:11:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2156713346.jpg
Slovakia signs pilot contract for purchase of natural gas from Azerbaijan	Slovak state-owned energy supplier Slovensky plynarensky priemysel (SPP) has signed a short-term pilot contract to purchase natural gas from Azerbaijan, the company told Reuters on Nov. 12. Russian gas continues to flow through Ukraine to the European Union as part of a deal signed in 2019, which is set to expire in December 2024. European states and Ukraine have been in talks with Azerbaijan to replace Russia as a supplier. SPP may also consider a longer-term agreement, as it is also preparing to cut off Russian gas supplies through Ukraine. SPP said it had diversified its gas purchase contracts with BP, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Eni, and RWE and has up to 150% of its customers&apos; consumption as a &quot;safety cushion.&quot; The company added that this volume could grow. &quot;Due to the high risk of stopping gas supplies via the eastern pipeline, we are taking measures to guarantee safe gas supplies to our customers, from large industrial customers to households, in any situation,&quot; SPP CEO Vojtech Ferencz said. The southern transit route through the Turk Stream pipeline across the Black Sea will be important if transit through Ukraine is stopped and some Russian or Azerbaijani gas could go through this pipeline, according to SPP. SPP said that with the loss of Russian supplies, it would have to buy all the volume it needs from another source and physically transport it to Slovakia, costing it at least 140 million euros ($148.6 million) more. Slovakia is among the countries most reliant on Russian energy supplies. While Moscow cut much of its pipeline gas transit to Europe in 2022, Slovakia, Austria, and Hungary remain heavily dependent on Russian imports. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said on Sept. 6 that negotiations are underway with the EU, Moscow, and Kyiv to transport Azeri gas after Ukraine stops transiting Russian gas. Gas supplies from Azerbaijan would have to first transit through southern Russia before reaching Ukraine. Europe is &quot;fully committed&quot; to phasing out Russian gas and is &quot;ready to live without this Russian gas coming from the Ukrainian transit route,&quot; EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson said on Sept. 11. However, with Azerbaijan itself increasing imports of Russian gas since the start of the full-scale war, the EU&apos;s turn to Azerbaijan has been criticized for simply bringing the same gas to Europe but with extra steps.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovakia-signs-pilot-contract-for-purchase-of-natural-gas-from-azerbaijan/	2024-11-13T07:58:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1229695308.jpg
Ukrainian FM meets Blinken in Brussels as new US administration looms	Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha met with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Brussels on Nov. 13 for bilateral talks. The officials met after the U.S. administration pledged to ramp up support before President Joe Biden leaves the White House on Jan. 20, 2025. Blinken said in Brussels before meeting Sybiha that the Biden administration plans to increase U.S. military assistance to Ukraine in the final months of its term to give as much support to Ukraine as possible before Donald Trump takes office. Western countries also seek to &quot;Trump-proof&quot; their support for Kyiv. One such effort reportedly includes U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer pressuring Biden to permit Ukraine to strike with Western-supplied long-range weapons deep into Russian territory, as well as releasing $20 billion in aid. The urgency is fueled by the ambiguity of Trump&#x2019;s plans for Ukraine as he did not elaborate on his plans but vowed to end the war &quot;24 hours&quot; after winning the election, leaving analysts and capitals all over the world guessing. In a phone call shortly after his victory, Trump allegedly warned Russian President Vladimir Putin not to escalate the war, but the Kremlin later flat-out denied that the call took place.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-fm-meets-blinken-in-brussels-as-new-us-administration-looms/	2024-11-13T06:08:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Sybiha-Blinken.jpg
Military donations in Ukraine plummet as war pressure mounts, Bloomberg reports	Military donations in Ukraine have fallen sharply amid rising financial pressures and war weariness, with major charities reporting drops by 20% or more in 2024, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 13. Prominent organizations such as Come Back Alive and the Serhiy Prytula Foundation, headed by the well-known Ukrainian TV personality of the same name, have seen contributions decrease by approximately one-fifth in 2024, Bloomberg reports. Other groups supporting the Armed Forces report even steeper declines. While these charities provide essential support, they cover only a fraction of Ukraine&#x2019;s total military needs. In 2024, Prytula&#x2019;s foundation raised Hr 1.4 billion ($34 million), a figure that pales in comparison to Ukraine&#x2019;s $50 billion military budget. Come Back Alive, one of Ukraine&apos;s largest charitable foundations, reported a 15% drop in donations in the same year, based on its reports on the receipt of donations. Meanwhile, Reactive Post, another non-governmental organization, told Bloomberg that its contributions have decreased by over 40% this year compared to the same period in 2023. Prytula cited economic challenges and the hardships brought on by power outages as likely reasons for the downturn. In an interview with Ukrainska Pravda, Taras Chmut, the head of Come Back Alive, expressed concern over 2024&#x2019;s fundraising efforts, saying they &quot;have not started as well as we would like.&quot; Chmut explained that as more Ukrainians leave the country, incomes decline, and living costs rise, donations are inevitably impacted. Oleh Karpenko, the head of partnerships at Come Back Alive, told the BBC that donation patterns vary based on events such as shelling in Ukraine, drone strikes in Russia, power outages, battlefield developments, and military successes or setbacks. On Oct. 25, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced a new eSupport initiative scheduled to launch on Dec. 1. Under this program, each Ukrainian will receive Hr 1,000 ($24) in aid, which can be used for specific expenses. Deputy Economy Minister Oleksii Soboliev clarified that these funds could be redirected to the military through donations, even if foreign aid itself cannot be directly allocated for military purposes, as reported by the NV news outlet.	https://kyivindependent.com/military-donations-in-ukraine-plummet/	2024-11-13T05:32:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1613314577.jpg
Biden invites Trump to White House to talk over transition	Incumbent U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to host President-elect Donald Trump in the White House on Nov. 13 to talk over the transition of administrations, a spokesperson said. &quot;He (Biden) believes in the norms, he believes in our institution, he believes in the peaceful transfer of power,&quot; White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told journalists on Nov. 12. &quot;That is what is the norm. That is what is supposed to happen.&quot; With Biden and Trump holding drastically different views on many domestic and foreign policies, they might discuss topics other than the transition, like the continuation and importance of U.S. military aid to Ukraine. Trump&#x2019;s support for Ukraine hangs in the air as analysts and politicians try to gauge his plans to bring peace to Ukraine, as he promised to end the war within &quot;24 hours&quot; after reelection without revealing details. Outgoing President Biden has seen the handling of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine as a defining element of his presidency, gradually giving more military kit to Ukraine as Kyiv emerged victorious from the early battle of Kyiv in April 2022. Since then, he has greenlighted and pushed through Congress numerous military aid packages. &#xA0;The Biden administration has also received criticism over its supposedly cumbersome and piecemeal approach to the support, which may have contributed to Ukraine&apos;s mounting setbacks on the battlefield. Although Trump&#x2019;s self-imposed 24-hour deadline has passed, the next president has provided few details on how he plans to achieve his peace promise. Numerous reports over the last year have given some clues about his plans to end Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. The very nature of such a quick deal heavily suggests Ukraine being forced to cede land to Russia. In April, the Washington Post reported Trump would pressure Ukraine to cede the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia occupied in 2014, and the far eastern Donbas region. Two months later, two top advisors to Trump proposed a plan that would cease military aid to Ukraine unless it agrees to hold peace negotiations with Russia. Recently, The Telegraph and the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump&#x2019;s peace plan may include deploying European troops to a buffer zone in Ukraine after the current front line in Ukraine was frozen. In exchange for ceding territory, Ukraine would receive weapons from the U.S. and would agree not to pursue its ambition to join NATO for 20 years. In stark opposition to Trump&#x2019;s plans, President Biden repeatedly assured Ukraine that it is their decision to enter into negotiations with Russia on their terms and that their territorial integrity cannot be a bargaining chip traded by other countries over their head. To give as much support to Ukraine as possible before Trump takes office in January 2025, the Biden administration plans to increase U.S. military assistance to Ukraine in the final months of its term, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Brussels on Nov. 13.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-to-host-trump-in-white-house/	2024-11-13T05:09:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178339692.jpg
Moscow court issues arrest warrants for ICC judges involved in Russia-linked cases	A Moscow court ordered an arrest in absentia of Reine Alapini-Gansou, the second vice-president of the International Criminal Court (ICC), the independent news outlet Mediazona reported on Nov. 13. The case against Alapini-Gansou was launched under the article of &quot;illegal detention,&quot; Mediazona reported without providing additional details. She has also been placed on the wanted list, the court told the Interfax news agency. Russia has extensively used lawfare to pressure and intimidate ICC judges since the Hague court issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin and official Maria Lvova-Belova in March 2023 over the forced deportation of Ukrainian children. A Beninese jurist with extensive experience in women&apos;s rights and human rights advocacy, Alapini-Gansou was elected to the ICC in 2018. Earlier this year, she became a deputy to the ICC&apos;s president, Tomoko Akane, who issued the arrest warrant for Putin in March 2023. Russia opened an investigation into Akane and other judges soon after. The arrest warrant against Alapini-Gansou, who was one of the judges who issued arrest warrants against Moscow&apos;s proxies in South Ossetia over alleged war crimes during the 2008 Georgia war, comes only days after a Russian warrant in absentia for another ICC judge, Haykel Ben Mahfoudh. Ben Mahfoudh was a member of a panel that issued an arrest warrant for former Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces Valery Gerasimov over suspected war crimes in Ukraine. The Tunisian lawyer and a specialist in international law was elected to the ICC for a nine-year term in March 2024. The ICC in March also issued arrest warrants for two Russian military commanders for carrying out strikes on Ukrainian electricity infrastructure during the winter of 2022- 2023. Lieutenant General Sergei Kobylash and Admiral Viktor Sokolov &quot;are each allegedly responsible&quot; for a number of war crimes, including &quot;directing attacks at civilian sites,&quot; the court said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-icc/	2024-11-13T04:43:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/ICC.jpg
Blinken meets NATO's Rutte, pledges to 'shore up' Ukraine support before Trump transition	The Biden administration plans to increase U.S. military assistance to Ukraine in the final months of its term, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Brussels on Nov. 13. The statement came during Blinken&apos;s one-day emergency visit to Brussels, where he met with several officials, including NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. Blinken said that the outgoing administration would &quot;continue to shore up everything we&apos;re doing for Ukraine&quot; to ensure it can either fight effectively next year or negotiate peace with Russia from a position of strength. The urgent trip comes amid heightened concerns about future support for Ukraine following Donald Trump&apos;s election victory and a political crisis in Germany, both of which raise uncertainties at a critical juncture in the conflict with Russia. Trump has previously claimed he could end the war in a day, and according to the Washington Post, he recently spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin, advising against escalation. The Kremlin has denied the report. &quot;We will continue to shore up everything we&#x2019;re doing for Ukraine to ensure it can effectively defend itself,&quot; Blinken said ahead of planned discussions with allied representatives and Ukrainian officials. &quot;President Biden fully intends to drive through the tape and use every remaining day to further strengthen this alliance,&quot; he added. Blinken also issued a stern warning regarding North Korea&#x2019;s recent deployment of troops to support Russian forces, saying this &quot;demands and will receive a firm response.&quot; The U.S. diplomacy chief emphasized the interconnected nature of security, citing the growing &quot;indivisibility of security between the Euro-Atlantic, Indo-Pacific, and Middle Eastern theaters,&quot; and urged allies to pursue even closer cooperation. With only a few months left, the Biden administration plans to expedite over $6 billion in already appropriated funding for Ukrainian military support. &quot;Our approach remains consistent,&quot; said U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on CBS&apos;s Face the Nation, &quot;which is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position on the battlefield, and ultimately at the negotiating table.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/blinken-meets-rutte/	2024-11-13T03:56:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183854928.jpg

Russian attacks against Ukraine injure 15 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine injured 15 people over the past day, regional authorities reported on Nov. 13. Russia launched a combined drone and missile attack on Kyiv and Kyiv Oblast overnight on Nov. 13, authorities said, reporting explosions and active air defenses in the capital at around 7:20 a.m. A 48-year-old man suffered head injuries in Kyiv Oblast as a result of fallen debris. A fire also broke out in a warehouse in the Brovary district near Kyiv, the regional military administration and the State Emergency Service said. Russia attacked the city with air-launched cruise missiles, Iskander-M or North Korean KN-23/24 ballistic missiles, and attack drones, authorities said. Overall, Russia reportedly launched 90 Shahed and other drone types overnight, as well as two S-300 missiles, two Kh-101 missiles, and two Iskander-M/KN-23 missiles. Ukrainian forces downed all the Kh-101 and Iskander/KN-23 missiles and 37 drones over eight oblasts, employing electronic warfare, mobile fire groups, and air defense across various regions, the Air Force said. The Russian military targeted a fire department, an administrative building, and an educational institution in 20 settlements of Kherson Oblast, including the city of Kherson, injuring 10 people, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.

Ukraine receives $1.35 billion US grant for humanitarian, social programs	Ukraine has received a $1.35 billion grant from the U.S., which will be allocated to humanitarian and social programs, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on Nov. 13. This grant builds on previous U.S. support, such as the $13 million Rehab4U initiative launched in October 2024 to assist Ukrainians with rehabilitation after the war. Ukraine has become increasingly reliant on foreign aid as Russia&apos;s war puts mounting pressure on the country&apos;s economy. In a post on social media platform X, Shmyhal explained that the funding was provided through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The prime minister highlighted that the funds would support critical humanitarian and social initiatives, emphasizing, &quot;It&#x2019;s a vital investment in Ukraine&#x2019;s resilience and global security.&quot; A follow-up press release from the Finance Ministry provided additional details. In this release, Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko said that since February 2022, direct budget support from the U.S. has reached a total of $28.2 billion, making the U.S. the largest financial contributor to Ukraine. The minister stressed that this ongoing partnership helps Ukraine maintain financial stability and provide essential public services, including education and emergency rescue services, amid Russia&apos;s aggression. The U.S. State Department had already allocated $237 million in humanitarian aid to provide life-saving assistance, including critical winter preparedness ahead of the harsh winter months. Marchenko also reiterated the ministry&apos;s commitment to an accountable and transparent funding process.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-receives-1-35-billion-us-grant-for-humanitarian-social-programs/	2024-11-13T02:15:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168960387.jpg
Russian navy officer allegedly killed in car bombing in occupied Sevastopol	A car exploded on a city street in Sevastopol in occupied Crimea on Nov. 13, killing a military service member behind the wheel, according to Russian-installed proxy head Mikhail Razvozhayev. While it remains unclear who was behind the incident, several Russian officers involved in the war against Ukraine have been found dead under suspicious circumstances in Russia or Russian-occupied territories throughout the full-scale war. First responders from the Russian Emergency Ministry arrived on the scene by 9:59 a.m. local time, only six minutes after the explosion. Despite their efforts and the rapid transfer of the driver to an ambulance, he succumbed to his injuries shortly after. Razvozhayev confirmed that the deceased was a military officer and indicated that the explosion&#x2019;s cause remains under investigation, noting that &quot;the possibility of sabotage cannot be ruled out.&quot; The Telegram channel Baza identified the serviceman as 47-year-old Valery Trankovsky, a captain of the 1st rank in the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported that Trankovsky had previously served as chief of staff for a missile boat brigade involved in the war in Ukraine, with its vessels launching Kalibr missile strikes. Russian media outlet Mash claims that Trankovsky had been under surveillance for roughly a week and that an improvised explosive device (IED) was placed under the driver&apos;s side of his car and allegedly detonated remotely. Ukraine has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-navy-officer-allegedly-killed-in-car-bombing-in-sevastopol/	2024-11-13T01:16:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Baza-2.jpg
US has delivered 83% of munitions committed to Ukraine since April, Pentagon says	The U.S. has delivered 83% of munitions, 67% of critical air defense systems, and 60% of firepower capabilities committed to Ukraine under defense packages between April and mid-October, Pentagon spokesperson Major General Pat Ryder said on Nov. 12. Kyiv has previously complained about a slow pace of U.S. aid deliveries. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an Oct. 30 press conference that only 10% of the aid approved by Congress in April had actually reached Ukraine. &quot;Since the supplemental, we&apos;ve drawn down nearly $3.7 billion in equipment from (Department of Defense) stocks across 12 PDA (presidential drawdown authority) drawdowns that were announced between late April through mid-October,&quot; Ryder said. &quot;Between the passage of the supplemental and the middle of last month, we&apos;ve delivered to Ukraine 83% of the critical munitions that we&apos;ve committed from stock, including 155-millimeter artillery rounds, GMLRs, Patriot, NASAMS, missiles, and more.&quot; &quot;We&apos;ve also delivered 67% of other critical air defense commitments, including Stingers and Hawk missiles, and we&apos;ve delivered 60% of the fire&apos;s capabilities we have committed, including small diameter bombs and 105-millimeter ammunition,&quot; he added. Ryder added that approximately $7 billion remains for further support, emphasizing that the U.S. would continue supplying Ukraine based on urgent battlefield demands, regardless of political developments. Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh echoed this commitment in a Nov. 7 briefing, saying that the U.S. aims to deliver the remaining $7 billion in pledged military aid before President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on Jan. 20. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told CBS News that U.S. President Joe Biden intends to persuade the incoming Trump administration of the importance of continuing support for Ukraine. Despite these assurances, Zelensky has underscored that only a fraction of the promised aid has materialized. Zelensky&apos;s recent European tour seeking additional military support also faced challenges, with a lukewarm reception from leaders in London, Rome, Paris, and Berlin, who offered less robust commitments than anticipated. Publicly, both the U.S. government and NATO remain committed to sustaining support for Ukraine. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte emphasized the alliance&apos;s stance, saying, &quot;Russia, working together with North Korea, Iran, and China, is not only threatening Europe but also the Indo-Pacific and North America. So we must stand together. &#x2026; We must do more than just keep Ukraine in the fight.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-has-delivered-83-of-munitions-committed-to-ukraine-since-april-pentagon-says/	2024-11-13T00:51:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1492682431.jpeg
Trump picks Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy to lead new government efficiency body	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 12 selected Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the &quot;Department of Government Efficiency,&quot; a new body designed to &quot;drive large-scale structural reform.&quot; Ramaswamy, a wealthy entrepreneur, and Musk, one of the world&#x2019;s richest people and owner of SpaceX, Tesla, and X (formerly known as Twitter), have no background in politics apart from Ramaswamy&#x2019;s brief running for the Republican presidential nomination. While Musk has repeatedly echoed pro-Russian talking points on Ukraine, including proposals to cede territory to Moscow, Ramaswamy was among the most vocal opponents of military aid for Kyiv. Ramaswamy was a Republican contender for Trump to receive the party&#x2019;s presidential nomination, then quit the race and endorsed him in January 2024. Trump first outlined his idea of a &quot;Department of Government Efficiency&quot; in September, naming Musk as the possible leader of the new bureaucratic institution. The body is envisioned to provide &quot;advice and guidance from outside of Government&quot; and is not a government agency as its name would suggest. Musk gained praise across Ukraine at the beginning of the full-scale invasion for helping the country access the internet through his Starlink network. He then made numerous comments that angered Ukrainians, including the suggestion that Ukrainian territory be exchanged for a peace deal with Russia. He also called on Ukraine to negotiate with Russia and prognosticated the fall of Odesa earlier this year, and was reportedly in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin since late 2022. He happened to be on the line during a recent phone call between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, Axios reported on Nov. 8, citing unnamed sources. Ramaswamy was an outspoken opponent of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, appearing in a live conversation on X on Feb. 12 along with Republican senators arguing against the passage of $60 billion in U.S. aid for Ukraine. The package was later passed in both chambers of the U.S. legislature but with significant delay, contributing to the fall of Ukrainian cities later in 2024. During his campaign, Ramaswamy also called Zelensky a &quot;Nazi,&quot; a &quot;comedian in cargo pants,&quot; and advocated for the recognition of occupied territories as Russian since they are &quot;Russian speaking.&quot; &#x200C;&#x200C; Trump also named South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as the leader of Homeland Security, who earlier called Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine &quot;Europe&#x2019;s fight, not ours.&quot; Earlier, Trump named Michael Waltz his national security advisor. Waltz&apos;s views on Ukraine evolved from an ardent supporter of U.S. military aid to questioning it and advocating for relocating these resources against China. Trump&apos;s defense secretary is confirmed to be Pete Hegseth, an army veteran and current Fox News host. His secretary of state, overseeing U.S. diplomacy, is reported to be Marco Rubio.	https://kyivindependent.com/musk-ramaswamy/	2024-11-13T00:21:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2176083179.jpg
US says North Korean troops join combat alongside Russia	North Korea has dispatched 10,000 troops to Russia, with most of them deployed in the western Kursk Oblast and taking part in combat, a Pentagon spokesperson said during a press briefing on Nov. 12. Washington is echoing earlier warnings from Kyiv that Pyongyang&apos;s troops have been deployed in the warzone in an unprecedented escalation of Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. &quot;Today I can confirm that over 10,000 (North Korean) soldiers have been sent to eastern Russia, and most of them have moved to the far western Kursk Oblast, where they have begun engaging in combat operations with Russian forces,&quot; spokesperson Vedant Patel said. &quot;Russian forces have trained the (North Korean) soldiers in artillery, in UAV and basic infantry operations, including trench clearing, which are critical skills for front-line operations.&quot; According to Patel, the effectiveness of North Korean soldiers will &quot;in large part be dictated by how well the Russians can integrate them into their military.&quot; Russia is mustering a force of 50,000 soldiers, including North Korean troops, to launch a counter-offensive against a Ukrainian salient in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the New York Times reported on Nov. 10. The new force comes as Russia saw its heaviest losses last month, and the North Korean troops could be replacing injured and killed Russian soldiers, according to some experts. Clashes between the Ukrainian and North Korean soldiers are currently underway, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Nov. 5. North Korean troops have already suffered casualties, President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed on Nov. 7, without specifying the number.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-says-north-korean-troops-join-combat-alongside-russia/	2024-11-13T00:00:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1125139920.jpg

This number includes 1,770 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,300 tanks, 18,896 armored fighting vehicles, 28,966 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,408 artillery systems, 1,249 multiple launch rocket systems, 996 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 18,798 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-714-380-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-11-12T22:32:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1945434214.jpg
Russia launches missile attack on Kyiv	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched multiple missile attacks on Kyiv overnight on Nov. 13, Mayor Vitalii Klitschko reported. No information was immediately available on any damages or casualties. Russia launched the missile attack at 7:20 a.m. local time. The Kyiv City Military Administration said that power shortages may be introduced as a preventative measure as Russia continues to attack energy infrastructure ahead of the upcoming winter months.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-kyiv/	2024-11-12T22:00:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1393468211.jpg
Kyiv urges Estonian film festival to cancel Russian 'Deaf Lovers' film screening	Ukraine&apos;s State Film Agency has urged the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival (POFF) to remove the Russian film &quot;Deaf Lovers&quot; from its main programming, protesting the film&apos;s depiction of relations between Russians and Ukrainians, the agency announced on Nov. 12. The film, directed by Russian filmmaker Boris Guts, portrays a romantic relationship between two hearing impaired individuals &#x2014; a female Ukrainian refugee and a Russian man &#x2014; who met in Istanbul amid Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Critics of the film argue that the film&apos;s portrayal of a love affair between a Russian and a Ukrainian are heavily misaligned with the realities faced by Ukrainian women at the hands of Russian soldiers. Throughout the war, Ukrainian women have continuously suffered torture, rape, or other forms of sexual violence. As part of the POFF film festival, the program is set to include its &quot;Standing with Ukraine&quot; part featuring Ukrainian films that are &quot;dedicated to the Ukrainians who are determined to defend their right to decide their own future,&quot; according to the film festival&apos;s website. Despite praise given to the organizers for featuring Ukraine-focused films, the State Film Agency said that including a film directed by Russian filmmaker in Ukrainian-oriented programming may amount to carrying &quot;the risk of propaganda justifying (Russian) aggression.&quot; &#x201C;Given the aggression of Russia against Ukraine and the sufferings of a large number of Ukrainian people, it is of paramount importance to ensure that cultural platforms do not become tools for films blurring the boundaries of understanding the reality of Ukrainians,&quot; the agency said in a Facebook post. Following the agency&apos;s protest, the film appears to have been removed the lineup of the &quot;Standing with Ukraine&quot; programming, although a photo for the film still appears under the banner. The film is still listed in the film festival&apos;s main programming under a different film category. It does not appear as though POFF has provided a statement on the changes. Questions surrounding the screening of the film come as film festivals around the world have canceled screening of the &quot;Russians at War&quot; film, criticized by many for being perceived as an attempt to whitewash Russian soldiers involved in Russia&apos;s war of aggression against Ukraine. Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) opened an investigation against Russian filmmaker Anastasia Trofimova, the director of &quot;Russians at War,&quot; on the charges of justifying and recognizing the legitimacy of Russia&apos;s aggression against Ukraine and illegally crossing Ukraine&apos;s internationally recognized borders when filming in the Russian-occupied territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-urges-film-festival-in-tallinn-to-cancel-russian-deaf-lovers-film-screening/	2024-11-12T20:18:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1239774752.jpg
Trump names Fox News host and veteran Pete Hegseth as incoming US Defense Secretary	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. President-elect Donald Trump has named Fox News host and veteran Pete Hegseth as the incoming U.S. Defense Secretary, Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Nov. 12. &quot;Pete has spent his entire life as a Warrior for the Troops, and for the Country,&quot; Trump wrote on social media. &quot;Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First. With Pete at the helm, America&apos;s enemies are on notice - Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down.&quot; Hegseth previously served as an infantry captain in the Army National Guard doing multiple tours of Afghanistan and Iraq. If confirmed by congress, Hegseth will replace current Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin following Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025. Up until Nov. 12, Hegseth served as a co-host Fox &amp; Friends Weekend and has appeared as a regular contributor to the conservative-leaning network.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-names-fox-news-host-and-veteran-pete-hegseth-as-incoming-defense-secretary/	2024-11-12T18:59:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/gettyimages-1167012751-612x612.jpg
UK may deploy forces to Ukraine if future US aid declines, former UK PM Boris Johnson warns	Former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that the U.K. may need to send troops to Ukraine if U.S. support or military funding is reduced, GB News reported on Nov. 12. Johnson emphasized the importance of British support for Ukraine, noting that &quot;otherwise, our collective security will be really degraded by a resurgent Russia.&quot; He also discussed the divided views within the U.S. Republican Party on Ukraine, highlighting that &quot;Donald Trump has lots of different voices in his ears,&quot; with some Republicans taking &quot;the wrong line on Ukraine.&quot; However, Johnson credited Trump&#x2019;s past support, recalling that &#x201C;the battle for Kyiv might have been very, very different&#x201D; without U.S. Javelin missiles. As the British Prime Minister, Johnson was a major supporter of Ukraine, and has continued to push for the West to provide Ukrainians with military aid after his resignation in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-may-deploy-forces-to-ukraine-if-future-us-aid-declines-former-uk-pm-boris-johnson-warns/	2024-11-12T15:31:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/johnson.jpg
Lavrov to lead Russian delegation to G20 summit instead of Putin in light of his possible arrest in Brazil	Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will head the Russian delegation to the Group of Twenty (G20) summit instead of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Russian state news agency TASS reported on Nov. 12, citing Russian Ambassador Marat Berdyev. The International Criminal Court (ICC) in March 2023 issued a warrant for Putin&apos;s arrest due to his role in the deportation of Ukrainian children. Brazil is a party to the ICC&apos;s Rome Statute and, therefore, is required to detain Putin if he enters the country. Brazil previously issued a standard invitation to Putin for the summit, which will convene heads of state of G20 nations in Rio de Janeiro Nov. 18-19. In October, Putin said he would not attend the Rio de Janeiro summit, claiming he did not want to &quot;disrupt the normal work of the forum.&quot; Lavrov has repeatedly represented Putin at events involving world leaders, including sessions of the U.N. General Assembly and last year&apos;s G20 summit in India. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said in September 2023 that the decision to detain Putin at the G20 would be left to his country&apos;s judiciary. Putin visited Mongolia, an ICC member state, in September of this year, his first such visit since his arrest warrant was made public. Despite Mongolia&apos;s obligation under international law to arrest Putin, the Russian president received a warm welcome in Ulaanbaatar. Ukrainian lawmakers described Putin&apos;s Mongolia visit as &quot;a well-planned provocation&quot; meant to show his indifference to the rule of law.	https://kyivindependent.com/lavrov-to-lead-russian-delegation-to-g20-summit-instead-of-putin-in-light-of-his-possible-arrest-in-brazil/	2024-11-12T13:28:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179875820.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukrainian drone strikes oil depot in Russia; Ukrainian volunteers in Poland sign contracts with Armed Forces	Key developments on Nov. 12: A Ukrainian drone struck an oil depot in Russia&apos;s Belgorod Oblast, igniting one silo, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov reported on his Telegram channel on Nov. 12. &quot;Ten fire crews worked at the scene and quickly extinguished the fire,&quot; Gladkov said, adding there were no reports of casualties. The oil depot is located near the city of Stary Oskol, he added. In recent months, Ukrainian forces have launched a series of drone strikes aimed at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry, whose profits fuel Moscow&apos;s war efforts. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s concerted campaign to get permission to use Western-supplied weapons like the U.S-made ATACMs and the U.K&apos;s Storm Shadows to strike deep inside Russia has, to date, failed. However, drones can potentially have an outsized impact when they hit highly flammable and less protected targets, such as ethanol distilleries or fuel depots. Ukraine in September established the Unmanned Systems Forces, a separate branch of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces dedicated to drone warfare. Kyiv said it aims to produce 1 million drones this year, in addition to the thousands pledged by foreign partners. The Russian army is deploying trained assault groups to frontline positions in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command, told the news outlet Suspilne on Nov. 12. A day before, Voloshyn said that a new Russian assault in Zaporizhzhia Oblast could begin &quot;any day.&quot; In early October, Russian troops reportedly renewed their attack in the Zaporizhzhia sector. Kyiv warned of a potential Russian push in the southern region, just as Moscow&apos;s troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. According to Voloshyn, Russia is preparing to intensify its offensive toward the town of Orikhiv in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. This move will allow the Russian military to gain control of the logistics routes from Zaporizhzhia to eastern Ukraine, the spokesperson added. Another Russian target in Zaporizhzhia Oblast is the Hulyaipole sector, where &quot;important&quot; logistics routes for the Russian military are located, he said. Besides, Russian troops intensified their assault actions towards the village of Vremivka, trying to break through Ukrainian defensive positions near the settlements of Rivnopillia and Velyka Novosilka, according to Voloshyn. Voloshyn said in October that Russian forces were massing for a breakthrough in the direction of Orikhiv and Mala Tokmachka in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The area was the main axis of Ukraine&apos;s southern counteroffensive in 2023, which led to the liberation of the settlement of Robotyne but achieved no major results. Russian troops have intensified attacks against Zaporizhzhia, targeting its civilian infrastructure with guided aerial bombs. Ukraine&apos;s budget for 2025 envisages Hr 55 billion ($1.3 billion) for weapons production, Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin said on Nov. 12. Ukraine began actively developing its defense production after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Some Hr 54.55 billion ($1.3 billion) will be directly allocated for the development and implementation of new technologies, and the expansion of defense production capacity, according to Smetanin. The minister added that the 2025 figure is almost Hr 3.5 billion ($84.4 million) more than in 2024. Another 500 million will be allocated to an affordable loans program for defense companies. This program, created in 2024, allows manufacturers to take out loans at 5% per annum. The state budget will cover the rest of the interest, according to the minister&apos;s statement. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine approved the draft state budget for 2025 on Sept. 13. The state expects to get Hr 2 trillion ($48.2 billion) in revenues, while expenditures are planned at Hr 3.6 trillion ($86.8 billion). The draft state budget for 2025 envisages spending Hr 2.2 trillion ($53 billion) on Ukraine&apos;s defense, which is 26.3% of the country&apos;s projected gross domestic product (GDP). Ukraine&apos;s proposed 2025 budget passed its first reading in parliament on Oct. 31. The budget law will go through additional rounds of consideration before lawmakers hold a final vote, expected by Dec. 1. The first Ukrainian citizens have signed contracts with the Ukrainian Armed Forces as part of the Ukrainian Legion in Poland, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry reported on Nov. 12. The legion was unveiled in July as a volunteer military unit made up of Ukrainian men living in Polandand trained by the Polish Armed Forces. The first volunteer recruitment center was opened in October at the Ukrainian consulate in the eastern Polish city of Lublin. The unit is part of an effort to replenish the ranks of Ukraine&apos;s military as the all-out war with Russia continues into its third year. After signing the contracts, the volunteers went to a Polish Armed Forces military training ground to undergo 35-day basic training. Upon completing the training, the servicemen can continue training in their chosen specialties at European NATO bases. The training will be conducted under the guidance of Polish instructors using modern weapons. Commanders of the Ukrainian Armed Forces with combat experience will also participate in the exercises, according to the ministry. As of Nov. 12, the Legion&apos;s recruitment center had received about 700 applications from Ukrainians around Europe to join the military, the statement read. The legion will allow Ukrainians to join the fight while being able to return to Poland after completing their service. Under martial law instituted in 2022 after the start of the full-scale war, Ukrainian men aged 18-60 are not permitted to leave Ukraine without permission. The U.N. estimates that 6.7 million Ukrainians were driven abroad as a result of Russia&apos;s all-out invasion. This is in addition to a sizeable diaspora living in Europe, the U.S., Canada, and elsewhere since before 2022. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is preparing to press outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden to release a $20 billion loan for Ukraine during next week&apos;s G20 summit in Brazil, the Telegraph reported on Nov. 12. The loan is part of the Group of Seven (G7) has reached an agreement to provide Ukraine with approximately $50 billion in loans backed by the revenue from foreign Russian assets, the G7 announced on Oct. 25. The United States will contribute the bulk of the loan with $20 billion in assistance. The U.S. is closely followed by European Union countries, including France, Germany, and Italy, with a combined $19.4 billion. The remaining approximately $10 billion will be divvied up with Canada providing $3.7 billion, Japan providing $3.07 billion, and the U.K. providing $2.9 billion in loan funding. This would be the latest part of European power&apos;s attempt to persuade Biden to step up help to Ukraine before Donald Trump takes office in January, including allowing Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia&apos;s territory with Western-supplied Storm Shadow missiles. The U.K. prime minister will also press for a one-on-one discussion with Biden during the G20 summit, according to the Telegraph. Starmer also met and released a joint statement on Nov. 11. with French President Emmanuel Macron, &quot;stressing their determination to support Ukraine unwaveringly and for as long as necessary to thwart Russia&apos;s war of aggression in Ukraine.&quot; The two leaders will meet with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk soon as the trio attempts to &quot;Trump-proof&quot; the Western bloc&apos;s aid to Ukraine in case the incoming U.S. president decides to radically cut aid for Ukraine. Trump has repeatedly promised to end the war &quot;in 24 hours,&quot; and though he hasn&apos;t yet elaborated a plan, it is largely expected to involve Ukraine ceding land to Russia. Republican Senator Marco Rubio is expected to become the US next chief diplomat, who said on air shortly after Trump&apos;s victory that Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine has reached a &quot;stalemate&quot; and &quot;needs to be brought to a conclusion.&quot; He also voted against the U.S&apos; $61 billion aid package for Ukraine in April 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukrainian-drone-strikes-oil-depot-in-russia-ukrainian-volunteers-in-poland-sign-contracts-with-armed-forces/	2024-11-12T12:59:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1604726426.jpg
Russia's Arctic LNG 2 project has cut gas production to almost zero, Bloomberg reports	Russia&apos;s Arctic LNG 2 project cut production from its gas fields to almost zero in November after halting liquefaction last month due to Western sanctions, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 12, citing its undisclosed sources. Arctic LNG 2, owned by Russia&apos;s Novatek company, aims to produce almost 20 million metric tons of liquified natural gas (LNG) per year to sell primarily to Asian markets, potentially generating billions of dollars in revenue. It was envisaged as Russia&apos;s largest LNG plant and a flagship project to help the country become the world&apos;s leading LNG producer. The fields supplying the plant pumped an average of 0.4 million cubic meters of gas per day in the first ten days of November, Bloomberg reported, citing a person with knowledge of industry data. This is a drop of more than 90% from the average production in October, according to Bloomberg&apos;s calculations. This figure is also the lowest average production level for the Russian project since at least September 2023. Back in the fourth quarter of last year, even during the commissioning and start-up of the first line of Arctic LNG 2, its fields produced from 2 million to almost 14 million cubic meters per day. Arctic LNG 2 is key to Russia&apos;s efforts to increase LNG exports and develop the Northern Sea Route. Over the past year, it has been the target of several waves of Western sanctions. The U.S. State Department announced sanctions against two vessels and two entities connected to Russia&apos;s sanctioned Arctic LNG 2 project on Sept. 5. American sanctions previously targeted the Arctic LNG 2 project in a round of sanctions in late August, likely forcing Novatek to scale back the plans. Novatek itself was sanctioned after the outbreak of the full-scale invasion in 2022. The Financial Times reported in July that Russia is likely expanding its &quot;ghost fleet&quot; of tankers, created primarily to avoid Western oil sanctions, to LNG exports as well.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-arctic-lng-2-project-has-cut-gas-production-to-almost-zero-bloomberg-reports/	2024-11-12T12:30:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1236939137.jpg
Trump confirms he chose Waltz as national security advisor	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Nov. 12 he had chosen Michael Waltz as his national security advisor. Waltz is a Congressman from Florida and a retired Army Green Beret. His views on Ukraine have evolved. In 2022 he called on U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration to provide more weapons to Kyiv and argued that the majority of the Republican caucus supported U.S. assistance to Ukraine amid concerns that they could block aid. &#x201C;I think the vast majority of the conference realizes that we either pay now or pay later, that Russian President Vladimir Putin fully intends, if he takes Ukraine, to move on to NATO-allied countries like the Baltics, and Poland and Finland,&#x201D; he said. However, in October 2024 Waltz said that there must be a reassessment of the United States&#x2019; aims in Ukraine. &#x201C;Is (involvement in Ukraine) in America&#x2019;s interest, are we going to put in the time, the treasure, the resources that we need in the Pacific right now badly?&#x201D; Waltz asked. Waltz is one of the leading U.S. critics of China, with Trump and his allies focusing more on opposing China than reining in the Kremlin.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-confirms-nomination-of-waltz-as-national-security-advisor/	2024-11-12T12:06:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2162158284.jpg
Russia preparing a 50,000-people-strong offensive in latest attempt to push Ukrainian army out of Kursk Oblast	Over the past week, Russia had been gathering forces in what appears to be preparations for a decisive push in the country&apos;s Kursk Oblast. &quot;The situation is changing every day. Not long ago, we were on the offensive, and now we are on the defensive,&quot; a 35-year-old artilleryman with the callsign Spys, fighting in the area, told the Kyiv Independent. In light of the recent advances of Russian troops in Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kharkiv oblasts, the country now faces a new challenge: defending the positions gained in the August cross-border offensive. Ukrainian soldiers are holding off nearly 50,000 troops in Russia&apos;s embattled Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 11. Spared from decreasing the number of personnel conducting assaults in Ukraine&apos;s east and beefed up by over 10,000 soldiers from North Korea, Russia is likely to attempt to launch a major offensive from the north, potentially not stopping at the now nonexistent border. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, reported in early October that Russia had transferred around 50,000 soldiers from the front to Kursk Oblast. In early November, Ukrainian officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the New York Times (NYT) that an assault involving these soldiers would take place &quot;very soon.&quot; The Russian grouping in Kursk Oblast consists of marine brigades, including the 155th Guards Naval Infantry Brigade of the Pacific Fleet and the 810th Guards Naval Infantry Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet, an airborne division, special forces battalion units, and a number of assault battalions, according to Vadym Mysnyk, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Operational Tactical Group Siversk. Experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent noted that Russia had also deployed troops from the Leningrad Military District, stationed near St. Petersburg, and even formed some infantry units from military personnel who had previously maintained Russian airfields. &quot;The Ukrainian military was able to gain advantageous heights in Kursk Oblast and thus lured Russian reserves,&quot; Ukrainian military expert Dmytro Zhmailo told the Kyiv Independent. A visualization of Russian advances around Kursk Oblast over autumn 2024. (Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)&quot;If we had not done this, 50,000 troops would have definitely replenished the Pokrovsk, Kurakhove, and other priority directions for the Russians, and then the (Russian) advance in the east (of Ukraine) would have been more painful,&quot; Zhmailo added. Although the Kursk operation has been ongoing for several months, the Russian military involved in the area is still coordinating and forming combat units. As of early November, about 11,000 North Korean soldiers were already in Kursk Oblast. According to a report by the New York Times, North Korean troops would be fighting as light infantry, vulnerable to Ukrainian artillery and drone attacks, without the assistance of armored vehicles. Zhmailo agreed with the following assessment, adding that the number of North Korean soldiers transferred to Kursk Oblast will not significantly affect the course of the battle, given the recent Russian losses. He added that it is difficult to determine how effective North Korean troops are as there have been very few military clashes. Another Ukrainian defense expert, Andrii Kharuk, echoes Zhmailo&apos;s stance, mentioning that North Korean troops have not been involved in wars since 1953. The deployment of North Korean soldiers as light infantry is the most rational in terms of tactics, Kharuk added. &quot;During the Korean War in 1950-1953, North Korean troops acted in small groups, using the tactic of &apos;infiltration&apos; (between the opponent&apos;s military units) and consolidation of assault operations. This is a traditional tactic for them,&quot; Kharuk said. Among the challenges faced by North Korean soldiers, Kharuk mentioned the language barrier and that the North Korean army mainly fought in mountainous terrain. In Kursk Oblast, it faces a gently undulating plain. Yet, the expert emphasized that in any case, 50,000 personnel in this area is a &quot;rather large number.&quot; &quot;These are actually Russian losses of a month or a month and a half. It will take us a month and a half to knock out this number of troops ,&quot; Kharuk said. &quot;Their accumulation in Kursk Oblast is a positive thing. On the other hand, we cannot say for sure how many Ukrainian troops are involved in deterring Russian and North Korean troops.&quot; The Ukrainian command hasn&apos;t provided updates on the state affairs for Ukrainian forces in Kursk Oblast. Officials also do not disclose which units are fighting in this area. DeepState, a Ukrainian crowdsourced monitoring website, reported late on Oct. 10 that Russia managed to push through the left flank of Ukraine&apos;s salient in Kursk Oblast. &quot;The enemy is now trying to establish a foothold near the settlements of Novoivanovka and Zeleny Shliakh,&quot; DeepState reported on Telegram. The two settlements lie some 15 kilometers from the Ukrainian-held town of Sudzha and around 10 kilometers north of the Ukrainian border. Parallel messages also appeared on Russian pro-war channels. The well-known Rybar channel wrote that Russian forces launched several attacks in the Korenevsky and Sudzhansky districts, in which Ukraine established its foothold. &quot;I suspect both sides are taking significant losses in Kursk Oblast, with the Russians likely suffering considerably higher losses given that they are on the offensive,&quot; John Hardie, deputy director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s casualty rate may start to rise as trees shed their leaves, providing less concealment from Russian reconnaissance drones and exposing Ukrainian troops to greater threats from Russian artillery, glide bombs, and so on.&quot; Ukraine continues to maintain its positions on Russian territory not only from a strategic point of view but also from a geopolitical one, experts interviewed by the Kyiv Independent said. &quot;Withdrawing Ukrainian units from Kursk Oblast could help in the east (of Ukraine), though it would also mean sacrificing a potential bargaining chip in peace talks. However, stabilizing its lines in the east is also critical for Ukraine&apos;s negotiating position, and I doubt Moscow will be willing to begin negotiations until it has retaken all the territory in Kursk (Oblast),&quot; Hardie said. While Ukraine continues to retain Russian territories in Kursk Oblast, Russia keeps advancing at an increased pace deeper into Donetsk Oblast and beyond. In August and September, Moscow seized 5.5 times more Ukrainian territory than in all of 2023, according to the Ua War Infographics project. Kharuk called the potential loss of positions in Kursk Oblast in favor of reinforcing troops in other parts of the front &quot;insignificant&quot; for Ukraine from a psychological point of view, as it is Russian territory. At the same time, experts agree that Ukraine can hold Russian territories at least until early 2025. Zhmailo said that Russian troops would most likely advance into northern Sumy Oblast if they breach Ukrainian defenses in the neighboring Kursk Oblast. Ukraine&apos;s operation in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast has helped prevent the occupation of Sumy Oblast and its regional center, the city of Sumy, Zelensky said on a number of occasions since the start of the offensive in early August. Meanwhile, Donald Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. presidential election has cast a shadow over further American assistance to Ukraine. The Republican candidate has repeatedly made controversial statements about the war and the Ukrainian government, including Zelensky. &quot;No country in the world, except for the U.S. and China, can stand up to Russia&apos;s military on its own. So, unfortunately, we are dependent on our partners here,&quot; Zmailo added, speaking about further Ukrainian operations on Russian soil. While the debate over future military aid for Ukraine rages on, the Ukrainian military still holds the front in Kursk Oblast. The artilleryman with the call sign Spys, who has been fighting in the Kursk sector since August, said that things are still &quot;more or less stable.&quot; &quot;Russian troops are bombarding us with glide bombs. One road leading to this (Kursk) direction is constantly monitored by Russian FPV (first-person-view) drones. This road is dotted with broken equipment. And we can&apos;t do anything about it &#x2014; the territory is small, and drones can be launched from any direction,&quot; Spys told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It is hard to say what will happen next. Our positions are being attacked regularly, but the contact line has not changed significantly so far.&quot; Additional reporting by Natalia Yermak.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-preparing-a-50-000-people-strong-offensive-in-latest-attempt-to-push-ukrainian-army-out-of-kursk-oblast/	2024-11-12T11:27:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172545405.jpg
Moldova protests to Moscow over election interference, downing of Russian drones	Moldova&apos;s Foreign Ministry said on Nov. 12 that it had handed a note of protest to the newly appointed Russian Ambassador, Oleg Ozerov, over Russian interference in the recent presidential election and the downing of two Russian drones on Moldovan territory. Moldovan authorities, independent observers, and officials from the EU and the U.S. have pointed to a malign influence campaign involving criminal networks and political groups tied to Russia. Moldovan lawmakers claimed that Moscow had spent millions of dollars to fund Alexandr Stoianoglo, a pro-Russian candidate who lost to President Maia Sandu in the Nov. 3 election. The Foreign Ministry protested to the Russian ambassador against &quot;Russia&apos;s illegal interference in the elections and referendum in Moldova to distort their results, undermine and delegitimize the democratic process in Moldova.&quot; &quot;The Foreign Ministry has repeatedly called on the Russian authorities to immediately cease these actions and refrain from any future interference in Moldova&apos;s internal affairs,&quot; the statement read. Apart from that, Moldova condemned the violation of the country&apos;s airspace by Russian drones on Nov. 10. Moldovan authorities found two Russian drones in the C&#x103;u&#x219;eni and R&#xEE;&#x219;cani districts after a Russian mass drone attack against Ukraine. &quot;Such aggressive incursions are a serious violation and an unfriendly gesture on the part of the Russian Federation and endanger the lives of civilians,&quot; the statement read. On the evening of Nov. 12, Moldovan law enforcement confirmed the downing of another drone in the country, the third in the last three days. The drone was found on the outskirts of the village of Co&#x219;erni&#x21B;a, in the Flore&#x219;ti district of central Moldova.	https://kyivindependent.com/moldova-voices-protest-to-russia-over-election-interference-downing-of-russian-drones/	2024-11-12T11:17:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1855344343.jpg
Russia deploys assault groups to Zaporizhzhia Oblast, military says	The Russian army is deploying trained assault groups to frontline positions in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command, told the news outlet Suspilne on Nov. 12. A day before, Voloshyn said that a new Russian assault in Zaporizhzhia Oblast could begin &quot;any day.&quot; In early October, Russian troops reportedly renewed their attack in the Zaporizhzhia sector. Kyiv warned of a potential Russian push in the southern region, just as Moscow&apos;s troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. According to Voloshyn, Russia is preparing to intensify its offensive toward the town of Orikhiv in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. This move will allow the Russian military to gain control of the logistics routes from Zaporizhzhia to eastern Ukraine, the spokesperson added. Another Russian target in Zaporizhzhia Oblast is the Hulyaipole sector, where &quot;important&quot; logistics routes for the Russian military are located, he said. Besides, Russian troops intensified their assault actions towards the village of Vremivka, trying to break through Ukrainian defensive positions near the settlements of Rivnopillia and Velyka Novosilka, according to Voloshyn. Voloshyn said in October that Russian forces were massing for a breakthrough in the direction of Orikhiv and Mala Tokmachka in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The area was the main axis of Ukraine&apos;s southern counteroffensive in 2023, which led to the liberation of the settlement of Robotyne but achieved no major results. Russian troops have intensified attacks against Zaporizhzhia, targeting its civilian infrastructure with guided aerial bombs.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-deploys-trained-assault-groups-to-positions-in-southern-zaporizhzhia-oblast-military-says/	2024-11-12T10:13:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/DSCF0520.jpg
Ukraine's 2025 budget includes $1.3 billion for weapons production, minister says	Ukraine&apos;s budget for 2025 envisages Hr 55 billion ($1.3 billion) for weapons production, Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin said on Nov. 12. Ukraine began actively developing its defense production after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Some Hr 54.55 billion ($1.3 billion) will be directly allocated for the development and implementation of new technologies, and the expansion of defense production capacity, according to Smetanin. The minister added that the 2025 figure is almost Hr 3.5 billion ($84.4 million) more than in 2024. Another 500 million will be allocated to an affordable loans program for defense companies. This program, created in 2024, allows manufacturers to take out loans at 5% per annum. The state budget will cover the rest of the interest, according to the minister&apos;s statement. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine approved the draft state budget for 2025 on Sept. 13. The state expects to get Hr 2 trillion ($48.2 billion) in revenues, while expenditures are planned at Hr 3.6 trillion ($86.8 billion). The draft state budget for 2025 envisages spending Hr 2.2 trillion ($53 billion) on Ukraine&apos;s defense, which is 26.3% of the country&apos;s projected gross domestic product (GDP). Ukraine&apos;s proposed 2025 budget passed its first reading in parliament on Oct. 31. The budget law will go through additional rounds of consideration before lawmakers hold a final vote, expected by Dec. 1.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-budget-for-2025-includes-1-3-billion-for-weapons-production/	2024-11-12T09:08:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/nammo-8.jpg
Marc Rubio's stance on Russia's war in Ukraine — what we know	Republican Senator Marco Rubio is likely to be the next U.S. secretary of state, according to reports on Nov. 12 that mark the latest insight into how President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s White House will approach Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. Trump, leader of the Republican party and who was elected president on Nov. 5 in a race where he beat Vice President Kamal Harris as the Democratic nominee, has repeatedly promised to end the war &quot;in 24 hours.&#x201D; Though Trump hasn&apos;t yet elaborated on his plan, it is expected to involve Ukraine ceding land to Russia or agreeing to a ceasefire and freeze of frontline positions, with Russia holding on to some 20 percent of Ukrainian territory. If appointed, Rubio would be the U.S.&apos; top diplomat and be at the forefront of any peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. Rubio, 53, is a Republican senator from Florida. The son of Cuban immigrants, he will be the first Latino U.S. secretary of state. Very. The Secretary of State job is the U.S.&apos; top diplomatic position, and the person in this role is responsible for &quot;carrying out the president&apos;s foreign policy decisions and advising the president on issues of international concern,&quot; according to the National Museum of American Diplomacy. Rubio stands to replace Antony Blinken, who, in the administration of outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden, has played a leading role in U.S.-Ukraine relations throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion launched in early 2022. It was Blinken, along with his British counterpart David Lammy, who in September first received President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s detailed account of why Ukraine needs permission to strike targets deep inside Russia using Western missiles. Blinken has made numerous important announcements regarding Ukraine, including humanitarian assistance from the U.S., the provision of air defenses, and F-16 fighter jets. He has also made numerous trips to Kyiv during Russia&#x2019;s full-blown war against Ukraine. While on the job, Blinken has been largely supportive of Ukraine and providing Kyiv with what is needed to continue its ability to fight back against Russia&apos;s invasion. Judging by his recent comments, Rubio is expected to take a more nuanced position that is tweaked to Trump&#x2019;s stance. Marco Rubio walks off the stage before the arrival of Donald Trump at the Miami-Dade Country Fair and Exposition on November 6, 2022 in Miami, Florida (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)What has Rubio said about Ukraine?Rubio&apos;s public statements on Ukraine appear to be very much in line with Trump&apos;s broad plans for the war &#x2014; a swift end to it. On the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly said he could end Russia&apos;s war within 24 hours if elected president, without elaborating on how he plans to achieve it. Rubio&apos;s statements and actions have been very much geared towards negotiation and an end to the war rather than giving Ukraine what it needs to evict Russian forces from its territory. Rubio was among the 15 Republican lawmakers in the Senate who voted against the $61 billion military aid package for Ukraine, which eventually passed in April &#xA0;2024. Its delay severely hampered Ukraine&apos;s fight against Russian forces. &quot;I think the Ukrainians have been incredibly brave and strong in standing up to Russia,&quot; Rubio said on Nov. 6. &quot;But at the end of the day, what we are funding here is a stalemate war, and it needs to be brought to a conclusion, or that country is going to be set back 100 years.&quot; In September, he insisted he was &quot;not on Russia&#x2019;s side&quot; but that the &quot;reality of it is that the way the war in Ukraine is going to end is with a negotiated settlement.&quot; &quot;I would be comfortable with a deal that ends these hostilities and that I think is favorable to Ukraine, meaning that they have their own sovereignty, that they don&#x2019;t become a satellite state or a puppet state that is constantly held hostage by the Russians. I&#x2019;m not going to prejudge any agreement.&quot; It&apos;s too early to say what sort of peace deal Trump&apos;s new administration will pursue and be able to forge, but some reports in recent months have provided clues. The latest report came last month when the Financial Times, citing its sources close to Trump&apos;s team, reported that he planned to freeze the war. According to the paper, Vice President-elect J.D. Vance, in September outlined the idea of freezing the war by establishing autonomous regions on both sides of the demilitarized zone and leaving Ukraine outside the NATO military alliance. According to one of Trump&apos;s longtime advisors, the new plan would rethink the failed Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015, which were never implemented. The agreements contained a plan that would create temporarily autonomous zones in Russian-occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts which would later be fully reintegrated with the rest of Ukraine. Occupied Crimea was not mentioned in the Minsk agreements. In July, Politico reported that Trump was reportedly considering the possibility of making a deal with Russia to block the future NATO accession of certain countries, namely Ukraine and Georgia. One of the sources told Politico that Trump &quot;would be open to something foreclosing NATO expansion and not going back to the 1991 borders for Ukraine.&quot; Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have pushed back against the notion of any sort of ceasefire that would cement Russia&apos;s battlefield gains. &#x201C;When (Putin) gains strength, he might issue an ultimatum &#x2013; to recognize all occupied territories, to stay out of NATO, to forget about European integration,&#x201D; Zelensky said in June.&quot; And there will be many such conditions, depending on how strong (Putin) is at that moment. Therefore, a ceasefire is a trap,&#x201D; Zelensky added.	https://kyivindependent.com/marc-rubios-stance-on-russias-war-in-ukraine-what-we-know/	2024-11-12T08:22:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182885671.jpg
Orban's hold on Hungary weakens as opposition unites behind unlikely challenger	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, on Nov. 7, looked confident. Budapest was hosting the European Political Community gathering, with Orban hugging it out with the continent&apos;s leaders whose standing at home leaves them little leeway to challenge the Russian-friendly prime minister. Orban&apos;s standing at home, practically unchallenged since 2010, has for quite some time allowed the prime minister to dictate his will to Brussels, Paris, and Berlin, with mixed success. Yet, Orban&apos;s grip on Hungary looks weaker than ever, with a formidable challenger, Peter Magyar, set to pose a threat come election time in April 2026. An October poll by 21 Kutat&#xF3;k&#xF6;zpont and a November one by Median show that the governing Fidesz party is neck and neck with the opposition Tisza party, led by a previously unknown former government loyalist, Magyar, now a member of the European Parliament. The 21 Kutat&#xF3;k&#xF6;zpont poll shows Tisza leading by 2%, and the one by Median gives the opposition a 7% advantage, without an outright majority, however. Despite Orban&apos;s unopposed rule, elections in the country are held with opposition parties participating, while those passing the 5% threshold receive money from the state budget. Due to government resources benefiting the incumbent party, and the media landscape controlled by the state, an uneven playing field had been benefiting Orban, the country&apos;s longest-serving prime minister. Hungary&apos;s opposition parties have suffered their fourth defeat in a row in 2022, but did not draw consequences or made structural changes on how they conduct politics, which fueled the mounting dissatisfaction of anti-government voters with them, Peter Stumpf, assistant research fellow at the University of Szeged, told the Kyiv independent. Meanwhile, a chain of scandals, from the stagnating Hungarian economy to a presidential pardon of a man convicted of covering up child molestation in a specialized institution, breached the popular trust in the Orban-led government. The popular dissatisfaction with both the government and opposition paved the way for Magyar, a man unknown to the general public before a series of Facebook posts earlier this year. &quot;Widespread dissatisfaction against the opposition parties and a largely stagnating economy since 2022 had no consequences until now for lack of alternatives on the supply side of politics. Then Magyar exploded onto the scene and harnessed its buoyancy,&quot; Stumpf said. Whether the popularity wave spurred by popular dissatisfaction remains, is to be seen. For years, Peter Magyar, the former husband of now-former Justice Minister Judit Varga, took various non-public roles under the Fidesz-led government. Yet, Magyar was able to seize the moment when the government-appointed President Katalin Novak pardoned a man convicted of covering up the fact that the director of the Bicske children&apos;s home was molesting children at the institution. Novak and Varga subsequently resigned following a series of protests. Magyar resigned from his post and took his anger with authorities to Facebook. In his first interview following the scandal, which gained 2.6 million views on YouTube, Magyar also discussed the inner workings of Orban&apos;s propaganda machine and reinforced existing rumors about widespread corruption and the informal power of certain actors within the regime.

(Akos Stiller/Bloomberg via Getty Images)In the interview, he also defended his ex-wife. &quot;I am certain that if there is no pardon case, we would not know who he is today,&quot; said Zoltan Novak, a political analyst at the Centre for Fair Political Analyses. The country&apos;s ongoing economic stagnation was the second key to Magyar&apos;s rapid rise. Since the start of Russia&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine, the Hungarian economy has been enduring a period of stagnation that has yet to be resolved. The country&apos;s inflation hit 17% in 2023, the highest in the EU, while the economy had contracted by nearly one percent. While the economy is set to rebound in 2024, with an International Monetary Fund-projected GDP growth rate of over 1.5% and an inflation rate of over 3%, popular support for the country&apos;s unmovable prime minister has dropped. &quot;There is an expectation on the side of opposition voters that there will be one person who will come, unite the anti-government voters and defeat Viktor Orban,&quot; Stumpf said. &quot;Magyar accepted and took up this messianic character.&quot; Shortly after his debut interview in February, Magyar&apos;s popularity soared. The Tisza party, which he joined soon after, received 30% during the European Parliament elections in June. Apart from the subsequent scandals, his success was attributable to his ability to turn Fidesz&apos;s attacks to his own advantage. &quot;After his debut, he was all over the media&apos;s agenda, dominating headlines for weeks. Regardless of whether it was good or bad coverage, Magyar professionally exploited this, moving up and reaching more people with his messages,&quot; Stumpf said. Lawyer and former government insider Peter Magyar holds the Hungarian flag during the demonstration he organised near the Hungarian Parliament on March 26, 2024 in Budapest, Hungary. (Janos Kummer/Getty Images)Following June&apos;s success, Magyar faces the task of building up a party while simultaneously campaigning for the 2026 elections. &quot;For the time being, there is no party organization, there is a leader, and a whole party has to be built under him, which is no small task,&quot; Novak said. One such task is finding candidates to run for the 106 single-member constituencies. Magyar said he plans to do it through a transparent casting of applicants, vowing to bar applicants with a history in politics. &quot;The more polarized a society is, the more risky it is for amateurs to enter politics,&quot; Novak said. &quot;On the other hand, it is a good initiative because it brings in fresh faces. But there are tremendous risks, politics is a profession for a reason.&quot; &quot;Tisza has come up with some very innovative and interesting solutions, trying to turn party recruitment and construction into a kind of reality show,&quot; Novak said. &quot;This will bring in some thrill and excitement, helping to attract younger voter&apos;s attention.&quot; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tested such a move during the 2019 parliamentary campaign. The newly elected president said he would pave the way for &quot;fresh faces&quot; to take on the responsibility. The move sparked controversy, as many people unfit for office or with ties to tainted businessmen were elected into office under Zelensky&apos;s party banner. Over a dozen lawmakers were kicked out of the party as a result. Meanwhile, the recent pollsters became a wakeup call for Fidesz which now will be forced to amend its stance on a number of key issues, Novak said. &quot;Dominant parties, such as the Fidesz, either &apos;soften&apos; or &apos;toughen&apos; up to challenges. Either they choose less polarizing rhetoric to look more inclusive or dig cleavages deeper to prevent the crossing of their voters to the opposite camp,&quot; Novak said. According to him, there are signs of both softening and toughening at the moment, exemplified by Orban&apos;s willingness to answer journalists&apos; questions in recent weeks but also by his extremely polarizing speech on the occasion of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 on Oct. 23. The coexistence of the two shows that no choice has yet been made inside the party. Stumpf said Fidesz has a double problem to solve before 2026 &#x2014; first, quickly find a solution to fix the state of the economy or find a way to frame it as something outside their circle of competence and responsibility; second, they will have to work out a different method to halt Magyar&apos;s rise. &quot;There doesn&apos;t seem to be a big policy push to tackle the crisis&#x2026; there is no clear message on what will happen to the economy,&quot; he said. Both analysts found it important to note that in regimes dominated by a single party, such as Orban&apos;s, the end usually results from an internal rift. Many believe Magyar can be up for the task.	https://kyivindependent.com/orbans-hold-on-hungary-weakens-as-opposition-unites-behind-unlikely-challenger/	2024-11-12T07:39:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2156657681.jpg
Ukrainian volunteers in Poland sign contracts with Armed Forces	The first Ukrainian citizens have signed contracts with the Ukrainian Armed Forces as part of the Ukrainian Legion in Poland, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry reported on Nov. 12. The legion was unveiled in July as a volunteer military unit made up of Ukrainian men living in Poland and trained by the Polish Armed Forces. The first volunteer recruitment center was opened in October at the Ukrainian consulate in the eastern Polish city of Lublin. The unit is part of an effort to replenish the ranks of Ukraine&apos;s military as the all-out war with Russia continues into its third year. After signing the contracts, the volunteers went to a Polish Armed Forces military training ground to undergo 35-day basic training. Upon completing the training, the servicemen can continue training in their chosen specialties at European NATO bases. The training will be conducted under the guidance of Polish instructors using modern weapons. Commanders of the Ukrainian Armed Forces with combat experience will also participate in the exercises, according to the ministry. As of Nov. 12, the Legion&apos;s recruitment center had received about 700 applications from Ukrainians around Europe to join the military, the statement read. The legion will allow Ukrainians to join the fight while being able to return to Poland after completing their service. Under martial law instituted in 2022 after the start of the full-scale war, Ukrainian men aged 18-60 are not permitted to leave Ukraine without permission. The U.N. estimates that 6.7 million Ukrainians were driven abroad as a result of Russia&apos;s all-out invasion. This is in addition to a sizeable diaspora living in Europe, the U.S., Canada, and elsewhere since before 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/1st-ukrainian-legions-volunteers-in-poland-sign-contracts-with-ukrainian-armed-forces/	2024-11-12T07:29:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-12-16_26_38.jpeg
Ukrainian drone strikes oil depot in Russia’s Belgorod Oblast, local official claims	A Ukrainian drone struck an oil depot in Russia&#x2019;s Belgorod Oblast igniting one silo, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov reported on his Telegram channel on Nov. 12. &quot;Ten fire crews worked at the scene and quickly extinguished the fire,&quot; Gladkov said, adding there were no reports of casualties. The oil depot is located near the city of Stary Oskol, he added. In recent months, Ukrainian forces have launched a series of drone strikes aimed at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry, whose profits fuel Moscow&apos;s war efforts. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s concerted campaign to get permission to use Western-supplied weapons like the U.S-made ATACMs and the U.K&apos;s Storm Shadows to strike deep inside Russia has, to date, failed. However, drones can potentially have an outsized impact when they hit highly flammable and less protected targets, such as ethanol distilleries or fuel depots. Ukraine in September established the Unmanned Systems Forces, a separate branch of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces dedicated to drone warfare. Kyiv said it aims to produce 1 million drones this year, in addition to the thousands pledged by foreign partners.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drone-strikes-oil-depot-in-russias-belgorod-region-local-official-claims/	2024-11-12T05:58:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1592375370.jpg
Trump's plan for Russia's war in Ukraine needs to be taken seriously, Finnish president says	Donald Trump should be taken seriously when he talks about ending the war in Ukraine, Finnish President Alexander Stubb told Bloomberg on Nov. 12. Trump secured victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, adding further uncertainty for Ukraine regarding the future of Western military aid, and its defense against the ongoing Russian full-scale invasion. But after a call with Trump on Nov. 11, &#xA0;Stubb said his intentions after taking office in January 2025 are clear. &quot;We in Europe and the rest of the world need to understand that Donald Trump is very serious about getting a peace deal sooner rather than later,&quot; he said. &quot;There&#x2019;s a window of opportunity for these negotiations between the election and inauguration day.&quot; Trump has repeatedly promised to end the war &quot;in 24 hours,&quot; and though he hasn&apos;t yet elaborated a plan, it is largely expected to involve Ukraine ceding land to Russia. In his interview with Bloomberg, Stubb gave four prerequisites for peace in Ukraine, which include territory, where &quot;we don&#x2019;t know where things are going to settle,&quot; security guarantees, justice and the &quot;low-hanging fruit&#x2026; reconstruction.&quot; In a sign of shifting from his predecessor&#x2019;s foreign policy course, Trump is expected to name Republican Senator Marco Rubio as the next U.S. secretary of state. Rubio said on air shortly after Trump&#x2019;s victory that Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine has reached a &quot;stalemate&quot; and &quot;needs to be brought to a conclusion.&#x201D; He also voted against the U.S&#x2019; $61 billion aid package for Ukraine which was eventually passed in April 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-plan-for-russias-war-in-ukraine-needs-to-be-taken-seriously-finnish-president-says/	2024-11-12T04:58:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183214747.jpg
Russian state TV airs explicit photos of Melania Trump as they congratulate her husband on election victory	The Kremlin-controlled state media channel Russia 1 ran explicit photos of Melania Trump during a segment last week in the wake of her husband&apos;s U.S. election victory. The sequence, which highlighted several pictures from her modeling career, was shown during the prime-time show &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; hosted by propagandists Olga Skabeeva and Yevgeny Popov. &quot;Here is how Melania looked in the year 2000. This is the cover of the magazine GQ,&quot; Popov says. &quot;In one of the shots, the model is only wearing her underwear, lying on a blue carpet with the United States seal, as though the editors of the men&apos;s magazine knew something in advance about the future of their model,&quot; he added with a smirk. Beside him, Skabeeva can be seen visibly trying to suppress laughter. Melania Trump, originally from Slovenia, was a professional model when they first met in 1998. It&apos;s not immediately clear why the government-controlled TV and its prime-time news program chose this particular angle. Since Russian President Vladimir Putin suppressed freedom of speech in the country in the early 2000s and placed a tight grip on all mainstream TV networks, with little has been allowed to be aired in Russia without the government&apos;s permission. Trump won the presidential vote on Nov. 6, defeating his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. The election is expected to have a profound impact on Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, as some worry Trump might seek to cut a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the cost of painful concessions by Kyiv. Putin congratulated Trump on his victory in the U.S. presidential election, saying he was ready &quot;to have discussions&quot; with Trump during the Valdai forum in Sochi on Nov. 7. But earlier this week, the Kremlin denied that a widely reported phone conversation took place between the two during which Trump reportedly warned Putin &quot;not to escalate&quot; the war in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-state-tv-airs-explicit-photos-of-melania-trump-during-bizarre-us-election-segment/	2024-11-12T04:29:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-12-at-13_44_50.png
British PM Starmer to press Biden to release $20 billion aid for Ukraine before Trump takes office, Telegraph reports	British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is preparing to press outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden to release a $20 billion aid package for Ukraine during next week&#x2019;s G20 summit in Brazil, the Telegraph reported on Nov. 12. This would be the latest part of European power&#x2019;s attempt to persuade Biden to step up help to Ukraine before Donald Trump takes office in January, including allowing Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia&#x2019;s territory with Western-supplied Storm Shadow missiles. The U.K. prime minister will also press for a one-on-one discussion with Biden during the G20 summit, according to the Telegraph. Starmer also met and released a joint statement on Nov. 11. with French President Emmanuel Macron &quot;stressing their determination to support Ukraine unwaveringly and for as long as necessary to thwart Russia&apos;s war of aggression in Ukraine.&quot; The two leaders will meet with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk soon, as the trio attempts to &#x201C;Trump-proof&#x201D; the Western bloc&#x2019;s aid to Ukraine in case the incoming U.S. president decides to radically cut aid for Ukraine. Trump has repeatedly promised to end the war &quot;in 24 hours,&#x201D; and though he hasn&apos;t yet elaborated a plan, it is largely expected to involve Ukraine ceding land to Russia. Republican Senator Marco Rubio is expected to become the US next chief diplomat, who said on air shortly after Trump&#x2019;s victory that Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine has reached a &quot;stalemate&quot; and &quot;needs to be brought to a conclusion.&#x201D; He also voted against the U.S&#x2019; $61 billion aid package for Ukraine in April 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/british-pm-starmer-to-press-biden-to-release-20-billion-aid-for-ukraine-before-trump-takes-office/	2024-11-12T02:06:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173589429.jpg
Marco Rubio likely to be Trump’s secretary of state, Reuters reports	President-elect Donald Trump will likely appoint Marco Rubio as U.S. secretary of state, Reuters reported on Nov. 12. citing unnamed sources. Rubio was among the 15 Republican lawmakers in the Senate who voted against the $95 billion military aid package for Ukraine, eventually passed in 2024 April. Shortly after Trump&#x2019;s election victory, Rubio said on air that Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine has reached a &quot;stalemate&quot; and &quot;needs to be brought to a conclusion.&quot; On the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly said he could end Russia&apos;s war within 24 hours if elected president, without elaborating on how he plans to achieve it. Rubio described Ukrainians as &quot;incredibly brave and strong&quot; but there&apos;s &quot;the reality of the war,&quot; he added. &quot;That doesn&apos;t mean we celebrate what Vladimir Putin did or are excited about it, but I think there has to be some common sense here,&quot; he said. &quot;We are funding a stalemate that&apos;s costing lives... and Ukraine is going to take 100 years to rebuild with everything they&apos;re facing.&quot; If appointed, Rubio will replace Antony Blinken. It&#x2019;s just the latest report of Trump planning to appoint a team with a dramatically different stance on Ukraine from the Biden administration. Earlier it was reported Trump has chosen Mike Waltz as his national security adviser, bringing a former special forces officer into a role that will steer U.S. global posture amid several high-stakes conflicts. Waltz, known for his plain-spoken approach and strong advocacy for Trump&#x2019;s vision, is expected to oversee a strategic shift in the handling of key international challenges, including the war in Ukraine and rising tensions in the Middle East, Politico reports. And Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik has been nominated as the next U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, according to a Trump statement on Nov. 10. &quot;Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America first fighter,&quot; he said. Stefanik has shown mixed views on Ukrainian aid over the last few years. While she supported increased U.S. military assistance to Ukraine in the past, and even co-authored legislation to impose sanctions on Russia before its full-scale invasion against Ukraine started, she has since opposed further aid packages.	https://kyivindependent.com/marco-rubio-likely-to-be-trumps-secretary-of-state-reuters-reports/	2024-11-11T23:53:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182884073.jpg
For 2nd day straight, Russia's reported losses in Ukraine surge to record levels	Russian forces suffered their deadliest day since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine for the second day in a row, according to figures released by Kyiv on Nov. 12 According to the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, Moscow&apos;s troops lost 1,950 men over the preceding day. This surpasses the previous record of 1,770 set just the day before. The total figure stands at 712,610. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. They are broadly in line with estimates from Western nations. The surge in losses comes as Russian forces step up pressure across the front lines. NATO allies believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin is aiming to recapture territory lost to Ukraine in Kursk Oblast before Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on Jan. 20. A British defense intelligence assessment, seen by The Telegraph, warns that Russia is likely to intensify kamikaze drone attacks on Ukrainian positions, using new launch sites near the border. In a bid to regain control, Russia has deployed 50,000 troops, including soldiers from North Korea, to the Kursk region. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said that as&quot;tens of thousands of enemy soldiers from the best Russian shock units&quot; are aiming to push Ukrainian forces out of the Russian enclave, raising concerns of a significant escalation in the war.

Kyiv warned of a potential Russian push in the southern region, just as Moscow&apos;s troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. According to Voloshyn, Russia is also deploying trained assault groups to advance in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. They are preparing to attack, he added. &quot;(The assaults) could begin in the near future, we&apos;re not even talking about weeks, we&apos;re expecting it to happen any day,&quot; the spokesperson said. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence said that Russia was planning to use armored vehicles and a significant number of drones, Voloshyn said, although it is not yet clear whether this will be a single offensive push or separate attacks. &quot;They are preparing both armored groups and light vehicles &#x2014; buggies, motorcycles &#x2014; to conduct these assault operations,&quot; he added. And in the east of Ukraine, Russia&apos;s grinding advances continue. Over autumn, large chunks of Ukrainian territory, sometimes including entire cities, have been lost on a near-daily basis in southern Donetsk Oblast, while Russian forces have also made operationally significant gains near Toretsk, Chasiv Yar, Kupiansk, as well as on their own soil in Kursk Oblast. Russia&apos;s increasing pressure on Ukrainian positions is coming at a huge cost &#x2014; the number of Russian troops injured and killed last month averaged 1,500 &quot;every single day,&quot; U.K. Defence Staff Chief Admiral Anthony Radakin told the BBC on Nov. 10. This is higher than the previous figure presented by the U.K. Defense Minister John Healey, who told The Telegraph on Nov. 8 that Russia suffered 41,980 killed and wounded during October- a daily average of 1,354. Russia is sacrificing high numbers of troops for &#x201C;tiny increments of land,&#x201D; Radakin told the BBC. However, he added that Russia is making &#x201C;tactical, territorial gains,&#x201D; and &#x201C;putting pressure on Ukraine&quot; amid a heavy offensive.	https://kyivindependent.com/for-2nd-day-straight-russias-reported-losses-in-ukraine-surge-to-record-levels/	2024-11-11T23:13:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2152572121.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 712,610 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 712,610 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Nov. 11. This number includes 1,950 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,276 tanks, 18,847 armored fighting vehicles, 28,870 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,352 artillery systems, 1,249 multiple launch rocket systems, 996 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 18,737 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-712-610-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-11-11T22:33:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1246697248-1675201427kqs1c.jpg
Putin hopes to recapture lost territory before Trump's inauguration	NATO allies believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin is aiming to recapture territory lost to Ukraine in the Kursk region before Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on Jan. 20. A British defense intelligence assessment, seen by The Telegraph, warns that Russia is likely to intensify kamikaze drone attacks on Ukrainian positions, using new launch sites near the border. In a bid to regain control, Russia has deployed 50,000 troops, including soldiers from North Korea, to the Kursk region. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said that as&quot;tens of thousands of enemy soldiers from the best Russian shock units&quot; are aiming to push Ukrainian forces out of the Russian enclave, raising concerns of a significant escalation in the war. U.S. media reports suggest that Trump spoke with Putin after the presidential election, cautioning the Russian leader against escalating the war, particularly with the addition of North Korean troops and supplies to the Russian military effort. The Kremlin&#x2019;s actions may also signal an attempt to build momentum for a larger offensive into Ukraine&#x2019;s northeastern Sumy Oblast. Ukrainian analysts noted that Russia has already reclaimed roughly half of the territory it lost in its Kursk incursion which began in early August. In a show of solidarity, U.K. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer met with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris to discuss Ukraine&#x2019;s defense strategy. Downing Street confirmed that both nations are working to position Ukraine strongly as it faces the challenges of winter. Western diplomats are cautioning that Putin may be acting swiftly to capture territory before Trump assumes office, hoping to gain leverage in future peace negotiations. While the Kremlin has denied reports of a conversation between Trump and Putin, U.S. media outlets have confirmed that the two leaders spoke, with Putin congratulating Trump on his election win and calling him &quot;courageous.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky has cautiously welcomed Trump&#x2019;s victory, urging the incoming president to maintain military support for Ukraine in the coming months.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-hopes-to-recapture-lost-territory-before-trumps-inauguration/	2024-11-11T21:25:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182372699.jpg
North Korea ratifies defense treaty with Russia	North Korea has formalized a mutual defense treaty with Russia, according to state media reports on Nov. 12. The agreement commits both nations to come to each other&apos;s aid in the event of an armed attack. The announcement follows reports of first clashes between the Ukrainian Armed Forces and North Korean soldiers stationed in Russia&#x2019;s border region of Kursk. North Korea&#x2019;s KCNA news agency confirmed that Kim Jong Un ratified the treaty as a decree. &#x201C;The treaty will take effect from the day when both sides exchanged the ratification instruments,&#x201D; KCNA reported. Russian lawmakers unanimously approved the treaty last week, and President Vladimir Putin signed it into law. The agreement, signed in June during Putin&#x2019;s visit to Pyongyang, mandates immediate military assistance by either nation in the event of an attack. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui, during her recent visit to Moscow, expressed solidarity with Russia, saying that Pyongyang would stand with Russia &quot;until the day of victory.&quot; South Korea, Ukraine, and Western nations have accused North Korea of deploying approximately 10,000 troops to support Russia&#x2019;s war effort. Western governments have also alleged that Pyongyang has supplied Moscow with artillery shells and missiles for use in Ukraine. The G7 nations last week denounced the increasing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia. They voiced concerns that North Korean soldiers might receive training in the use of ballistic missiles, which would violate UN Security Council resolutions.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-ratifies-defense-treaty-with-russia/	2024-11-11T20:16:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157679114.jpg
Trump picks Mike Waltz as national security adviser amid shifting Ukraine policy, Politico reports	President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Rep. Mike Waltz as his national security adviser, bringing a former special forces officer into a role that will steer U.S. global posture amid several high-stakes conflicts. Waltz, known for his plain-spoken approach and strong advocacy for Trump&#x2019;s vision, is expected to oversee a strategic shift in the handling of key international challenges, including the war in Ukraine and rising tensions in the Middle East, Politico reports. Waltz has expressed reservations about continued extensive U.S. military aid to Ukraine, arguing that European nations should increase their support to ensure regional stability. His stance includes backing a peace plan aimed at drawing Ukraine closer to Western alliances while diplomatically isolating Russian President Vladimir Putin. This view, while reflective of a significant portion of Republican thought, contrasts with positions held by many Senate Republicans and most Democrats who continue to advocate for sustained or increased aid to Ukraine. The incoming adviser&#x2019;s approach aligns with President-elect Trump&#x2019;s campaign promise to address the Ukraine-Russia war swiftly, aiming to end the war on his first day in office. Waltz&#x2019;s focus on urging Europe to take on more responsibility and his push for a negotiated solution mark a departure from the more interventionist positions of previous administrations. In addition to his views on Ukraine, Waltz will face the task of formulating responses to an evolving geopolitical landscape, including direct confrontations involving Israel and Iran. The selection of Waltz comes as Trump continues to build a foreign policy team that reflects his priorities. President-elect Trump is also expected to name Senator Marco Rubio of Florida as secretary of state, sources familiar with the decision told the New York Times. Rubio, initially known for skepticism toward foreign interventions, has recently echoed Trump&#x2019;s view that the war in Ukraine has reached a stalemate and must be brought to a conclusion.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-picks-mike-waltz-as-national-security-adviser-amid-shifting-ukraine-policy-politico-reports/	2024-11-11T18:50:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2162158284.jpg
Trump nominates new US ambassador to UN with mixed record on Ukraine aid	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik as the next U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, according to his statement on Nov. 10. &#x201C;Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America first fighter,&#x201D; he said. Stefanik has shown mixed views on Ukrainian aid over the last few years. While she supported increased U.S. military assistance to Ukraine in the past, and even co-authored legislation to impose sanctions on Russia before its full-scale invasion against Ukraine started, she has since opposed further aid packages. In April, she voted against the $61 billion aid package for Ukraine, citing her preference for prioritizing domestic issues such as the U.S.-Mexico border situation. The Biden administration has already committed to sending Kyiv the remaining $6 billion in allocated military aid before Trump&apos;s second term begins. Sullivan said those funds would be sent &quot;on time and in full&quot; before Jan. 20.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-nominates-new-us-ambassador-to-un-with-mixed-record-on-ukraine-aid/	2024-11-11T17:53:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1850457399.jpg
Estonia announces new military aid package for Ukraine	Estonia&apos;s Defense Minister, Hanno Pevkur, visited Kyiv on Nov. 11, where he met with President Volodymyr Zelensky and announced a new aid package for Ukraine, Pevkur said on X. During the visit, Pevkur signed a new military aid package, which includes clothing and small arms, marking Estonia&apos;s commitment to Ukraine&#x2019;s defense with 0.25% of its GDP dedicated to military support. Zelensky thanked Estonia for its leadership and emphasized effective cooperation to meet Ukraine&apos;s defense needs and equip new brigades. They discussed plans to finance the production of long-range drones in Ukraine and Estonia&#x2019;s support for Ukraine&#x2019;s aspirations to join the EU and NATO. The leaders also reviewed progress on a broader victory plan for Ukraine. Estonia has been among Kyiv&apos;s staunchest supporters since the start of the full-scale invasion began, offering humanitarian, developmental, and military assistance. Estonia and Ukraine signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement on June 26. The deal stipulates that Estonia will supply Ukraine with defense aid worth more than 100 million euros ($107 million).	https://kyivindependent.com/estonia-announces-new-military-aid-package-for-ukraine/	2024-11-11T15:56:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1813816466.jpg
EU has delivered over 980,000 shells to Ukraine out of pledged one million, Borrell says	Throughout 2024, the European Union has delivered 980,000 artillery shells to Ukraine out of the one million initially promised, the European Union&apos;s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, announced on Nov. 11. Borrell explained the shortfall, citing unexpected production capacity limits. Despite delays, he anticipates that total EU-supplied ammunition to Ukraine will exceed 1.5 million shells by the end of the year, thanks to both EU bilateral agreements and a Czech-led initiative. The Czech initiative, launched with support from countries including Canada, Germany, and the Netherlands, aims to supply 800,000 shells, with Czechia already delivering 50,000 as of mid-2024. Additionally, Ukraine and Czechia have agreed to start producing 155-mm and other large-caliber ammunition within Ukraine by 2025. Slovak activists also collected over 4 million euros ($4.3 million) for the initiative after the Slovak government refused to participate. Czechia unveiled its initiative to purchase artillery shells for Ukraine jointly with partners earlier this year amid shell shortages caused mainly by delays in U.S. assistance. Prague is also preparing to launch a new initiative to purchase artillery ammunition for Ukraine in 2025, Czech Defense Minister Jana Cernochova said in an interview with the Denik N newspaper on July 24.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-has-delivered-over-980-000-shells-to-ukraine-out-of-pledged-one-million-borrell-says/	2024-11-11T13:41:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2147867968.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russian forces damage Kurakhove Reservoir dam in Donetsk Oblast, Kyiv says	Key developments on Nov. 11: Russian forces damaged the dam holding the Kurakhove Reservoir in Donetsk Oblast on Nov. 11, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Filashkin&apos;s statement came after multiple reports of the dam being attacked near the village of Stari Terny, some 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the embattled town of Kurakhove. The Kurakhove Reservoir is located on the Vovcha River, with its source near the village of Progress. &quot;This attack potentially threatens residents of settlements on the Vovcha River, both in Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts,&quot; Filashkin said. It&apos;s not the first time a critical dam was hit during the full-scale war. Russia is carrying out intense attacks in multiple sections of the eastern front, with attempts to break through Ukraine&apos;s defenses in Donetsk Oblast toward the towns of Kurakhove and Pokrovsk. There is a threat of Kurakhove being encircled, Nazar Voitenkov, an acting spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s 33rd Separate Mechanized Brigade, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on Nov. 5. A high-rise residential building in Kryvyi Rih was hit by a Russian missile on Nov. 11, injuring at least 14 people including two children, local authorities said. The missile hit the building between the first and fifth floor, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Governor Serhiy Lysak reported, adding there may still be a woman and three children under the rubble. A 10-year-old girl, and an 11-year-old boy are among the injured. &quot;Russia seeks only to continue the war, and each of its strikes refutes any statements from Russia about diplomacy,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said on social media. &quot;Ukraine needs weapons to defend against Russian terror and stronger support from the world to make diplomacy real and strong.&quot; The aftermath of a Russian attack on the city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast on Nov. 11, 2024. (State Emergency Service)Russian attack in Zaporizhzhia Oblast expected &apos;any day,&apos; military saysRussian assaults in Zaporizhzhia Oblast could begin &quot;any day,&quot; Vladyslav Voloshyn, Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command spokesperson, told Reuters on Nov. 11. In early October, Russian troops have reportedly renewed their attack in the Zaporizhzhia sector. Kyiv warned of a potential Russian push in the southern region, just as Moscow&apos;s troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. According to Voloshyn, Russia is also deploying trained assault groups to advance in Zaporizhzhia Oblast.

Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence said that Russia was planning to use armored vehicles and a significant number of drones, Voloshyn said, although it is not yet clear whether this will be a single offensive push or separate attacks. &quot;They are preparing both armored groups and light vehicles &#x2014; buggies, motorcycles &#x2014; to conduct these assault operations,&quot; he added. Voloshyn said in October that Russian forces were massing for a breakthrough in the direction of Orikhiv and Mala Tokmachka in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The area was the main axis of Ukraine&apos;s southern counteroffensive in 2023, which led to the liberation of the settlement of Robotyne but achieved no major results. Russian troops have intensified attacks against Zaporizhzhia, targeting its civilian infrastructure with guided aerial bombs. A Mi-24 type attack helicopter was set ablaze and destroyed at an airbase in Russia&apos;s Moscow Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) claimed on Nov. 11. In a post on Telegram, HUR said the aircraft was attacked at a Russian airbase overnight on Nov. 9-10, and attached a video allegedly showing it on fire. It did not say how the helicopter was set ablaze. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the video. Russian losses in Ukraine reached a record daily high of 1,770, according to figures released by Kyiv on Nov. 11. The total surpasses the previous record of 1,740 on May 13. According to the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, Russia&apos;s total casualties now stand at 710,660. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. They are broadly in line with estimates from Western nations. While the Kremlin does not announce the number of dead and injured, Western officials have claimed October was the heaviest month yet for Russian forces. The number of Russian troops injured and killed last month averaged 1,500 &quot;every single day,&quot; U.K. Defence Staff Chief Admiral Anthony Radakin told the BBC on Nov. 10. This is higher than the previous figure presented by the U.K. Defense Minister John Healey, who told The Telegraph on Nov. 8 that Russia suffered 41,980 killed and wounded during October- a daily average of 1,354. According to some experts, the surge in losses in recent months may be one of the factors behind the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia. Russia is sacrificing high numbers of troops for &#x201C;tiny increments of land,&#x201D; Radakin told the BBC. However, he added that Russia is making &#x201C;tactical, territorial gains,&#x201D; and &#x201C;putting pressure on Ukraine&quot; amid a heavy offensive. While Russian forces are suffering record losses, they&apos;re also making increasingly swift gains in the east of Ukraine. According to a Bloomberg analysis published on Nov. 1, Ukraine has lost 1,146 square kilometers of its own territory since the launch of the Kursk Oblast incursion in early August, with the week up until Nov. 1 reported as the worst in terms of lost territory in all of 2024. On Nov. 2, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said that Ukraine was facing &#x201C;one of the most powerful&#x201D; Russian offensives since the start of the all out war. Over autumn, large chunks of Ukrainian territory, sometimes including entire cities, have been lost on a near-daily basis in southern Donetsk Oblast, while Russian forces have also made operationally significant gains near Toretsk, Chasiv Yar, Kupiansk, as well as on their own soil in Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-42/	2024-11-11T13:14:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2173356234.jpg

Kyiv Independent is 3 years old. Here’s a list of our consequential stories throughout the years	On Nov. 11, 2021, a group of young journalists in Ukraine fired for defending their editorial independence decided to launch a new publication that would stand by those principles. This new publication, without a name at its start, would later become known as the Kyiv Independent. Three years in, the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s coverage of Ukraine has won a dozen domestic and international awards. It has proven crucial for the world&#x2019;s understanding of Ukraine and the wider region since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, launched just three months after the Kyiv Independent was created. Below is a list of the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s coverage that has had an impact on how the world sees Ukraine and its fight for freedom. Our reporting on Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war began at 4 a.m. on Feb. 24, 2022, when Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the largest ground invasion in Europe since World War II. We were among the first publications to call the invasion a &#x201C;war,&#x201D; despite the Kremlin&#x2019;s attempts to frame it otherwise by euphemistically referring to it as a &#x201C;special military operation&#x201D; &#x2014; terminology many Western outlets parroted at the outset of the war. PUTIN DECLARES WAR ON UKRAINE We have covered all major stages of the war. We were there to cover the Battle of Kyiv from February&#x2013;April 2022 when Russian forces withdrew from the region, leaving behind a vast trail of brutal war crimes. We covered Ukraine&#x2019;s liberation of Kherson on Nov. 11, 2022, and how Russia has continued to launch near-daily attacks on the city since being pushed out. We have followed the fierce battles of Avdiivka, Bakhmut, Chasiv Yar, and Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast and reported from the front-line cities in the country&#x2019;s south, east, and north, including from Ukraine-controlled parts of Kursk Oblast in Russia. The Kyiv Independent has also covered the immense problems that come with fighting a defensive war, from the problems facing Ukrainian medical units to the lack of armor for women serving in the Armed Forces, and the way Ukrainian soldiers are dealing with Russia&#x2019;s chemical warfare. We have also written about the defense tech industry in Ukraine which has exploded in the wake of the war, and the challenges that it too, faces. One night in Bakhmut: Civilians wait for the end as Russia draws closer Eye of the storm: A day in the life of Ukrainian infantry on the zero line near Toretsk Morning in Sudzha: Inside Ukrainian-occupied Russia as Kursk operation continues &#x2018;Silent killer&#x2019;: Russia boosts grinding Donbas advance with chemical warfare Intense fighting, lack of resources leave wounded soldiers on their own &#x2018;She needs armor.&#x2019; Female Ukrainian soldiers call for equality Ukraine&#x2019;s drone companies face &#x2018;death, migration, or global acquisition&#x2019; amid defense spending squeeze Ukrainian drones are burning Russia&#x2019;s oil refineries, but not its economy Russian cities left defenseless as Ukraine ramps up drone attacks Over the three years of the news outlet&#x2019;s existence, the Kyiv Independent has produced a number of investigations of note.

2 Ukrainian POWs allegedly killed by Russian forces in Kursk Oblast, Prosecutor General's Office reports	Russian forces allegedly killed two captured Ukrainian servicemen in Russia&apos;s embattled Kursk Oblast, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office reported on Nov. 11. Reports of murders, torture, and ill-treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war are received regularly by Ukrainian authorities and have spiked in recent months. Most cases were recorded in embattled Donetsk Oblast. A footage purporting to show Russian soldiers shooting two unarmed Ukrainian servicemen in Kursk Oblast was spotted on social media earlier in the day, the prosecutors said. It is unknown when the video was filmed. The Prosecutor General&apos;s Office has opened a pre-trial investigation into the incident. Videos and photos have documented potential war crimes, including drone footage showing the shooting of the prisoners of war (POWs) as they surrendered to Russian troops. Other videos and photos point to torture and violent death in Russian captivity. Russian forces have executed at least 124 Ukrainian prisoners of war since 2022 as of Nov. 6, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said. Former Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin called the killing of Ukrainian servicemen in captivity a &quot;deliberate policy&quot; of Russia. Some 80% of the cases of executions of Ukrainian POWs were recorded in 2024, but the trend began to appear in November 2023, when &quot;there were changes in the attitude of Russian military personnel towards our prisoners of war for the worse,&quot; said Yurii Belousov, a senior representative of the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office.	https://kyivindependent.com/2-ukrainian-pows-allegedly-killed-by-russian-forces-in-kursk-oblast-prosecutor-generals-office-reports/	2024-11-11T09:28:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1960109268.jpg
Opinion: The central bank can't solve Russia's economic crisis in the face of war and sanctions	Almost three years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the West&#x2019;s financial sanctions have finally started to bite, triggering fierce infighting within the Kremlin over control of Russia&#x2019;s central bank. Russia&#x2019;s business community has remained largely silent over the past two years, even as Western sanctions triggered a surge in real interest rates. In recent weeks, however, business leaders have openly criticized central-bank governor Elvira Nabiullina, who has held her post since 2013 and reportedly sought to resign at the start of the war in 2022. While Nabiullina&#x2019;s position appears increasingly precarious, the Kremlin continues to insist that the sanctions have only strengthened the economy, making it more self-sufficient. This claim is patently false, as evidenced by Russian officials&#x2019; repeated calls for the West to lift its restrictions. In fact, since Russia&#x2019;s 2014 annexation of Crimea, economic sanctions have triggered three major exchange-rate crises: in March-April 2014, February-March 2022, and July-August 2023. Each time, Nabiullina managed to contain the fallout by hiking interest rates. But things have changed. On Oct. 25, the central bank raised its key interest rate from 19% to 21%, citing inflation concerns. In its statement, the bank noted that &#x201C;inflation expectations continue to increase&#x201D; and that growth in domestic demand is &#x201C;significantly outstripping&#x201D; the economy&#x2019;s capacity to expand the supply of goods and services. The statement added that increased government spending and the growing budget deficit have &#x201C;pro-inflationary effects,&#x201D; necessitating further monetary tightening. With official inflation at 9% and a real interest rate of 12%, Russia&#x2019;s long-dormant economic-policy debate is heating up. But the dominant voices are no longer those of actual economists, because most independent experts have fled the country to avoid imprisonment. Instead, three prominent oligarchs have recently spoken out against the central bank&#x2019;s interest-rate hikes. While the outspoken Oleg Deripaska&#x2019;s criticism was hardly surprising, Alexei Mordashov, who owns the Severstal steel conglomerate, typically chooses his words carefully. In late October, Mordashov acknowledged that &#x201C;the need to raise rates to limit inflation is clear&#x201D; but warned, &#x201C;We are coming to a situation where the medicine may become more dangerous than the disease.&#x201D; Both Deripaska and Mordashov have broad support among Russia&#x2019;s business elite. But the real shock came when Sergei Chemezov, CEO of the state-owned weapons and technology giant Rostec, rebuked Nabiullina in a speech before the Federation Council (Russia&#x2019;s upper legislative chamber), arguing that repeated rate hikes would lead to the bankruptcy of most enterprises.

(Maksim Konstantinov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Chemezov also warned that elevated interest rates might force Rostec to halt exports of high-tech products. Several other prominent business figures have voiced similar concerns, marking the first time since President Vladimir Putin launched Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine that he has faced open opposition to his economic policies. Since 2004, Putin and his cronies have amassed fortunes by rigging public contracts and systematically stripping the energy giant Gazprom&#x2019;s assets, as documented by the late Boris Nemtsov and Vladimir Milov in their 2008 booklet &quot;Putin and Gazprom.&quot; But European sanctions have turned Gazprom&#x2019;s once-enormous profits into huge losses, diminishing the financial clout of Putin&#x2019;s longtime allies &#x2014; the &#x201C;Gazprom parasites,&#x201D; including Mikhail and Yury Kovalchuk and Gennady Timchenko. As Milov recently argued, Chemezov has emerged as the dominant figure among Putin&#x2019;s business allies. Despite having few qualifications beyond his past KGB service alongside Putin in Dresden, he has leveraged this relationship to secure control of Russia&#x2019;s armaments industry, now consolidated under the company Rostec, which, backed by federal funding (though its finances remain a state secret), oversees roughly 80% of Russia&#x2019;s defense production. Chemezov is also a major beneficiary of the war in Ukraine. Recent shifts in government personnel &#x2014; most notably, the dismissal of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu &#x2014; have worked in Chemezov&#x2019;s favor, as Shoigu no longer dares to complain about Rostec&#x2019;s substandard products. Meanwhile, Chemezov&#x2019;s top prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;, Denis Manturov, has been promoted to First Deputy Prime Minister. Both Manturov and Alexei Dyumin, another Chemezov ally, now hold seats on the powerful Security Council. I knew Nabiullina in the 1990s, when she was a widely respected member of Russia&#x2019;s liberal camp. In 2013, a fierce struggle erupted within Putin&#x2019;s inner circle over who would lead the central bank &#x2014; a liberal or a statist. The main contenders were Alexei Kudrin, the liberal ex-finance minister, and the statist hardliner Sergey Glazyev. As Putin&#x2019;s economic adviser at the time, Nabiullina led the liberals to victory, aided by Putin&#x2019;s lingering fear of a repeat of the 1998 financial crash that brought down Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko&#x2019;s government. Nabiullina&#x2019;s current priorities seem to be to control inflation, reduce capital flight, stabilize the ruble, and support GDP growth, which is projected to fall to 0.5-1.5% in 2025, down from this year&#x2019;s expected 3.6% rate. But, having failed to curb inflation, she will likely be dismissed. Her trusted first deputy, Ksenia Yudaeva, was demoted in 2023 and reassigned to the International Monetary Fund. At the recent BRICS summit in Kazan, Putin even made a cruel joke at Nabiullina&#x2019;s expense, leaving her visibly distressed. The question now is whether Putin will replace Nabiullina with an unqualified loyalist who will slash interest rates, allow inflation and capital outflows to surge, and send the ruble into a tailspin. Given that Russia&#x2019;s economic crisis is a direct consequence of Putin&#x2019;s invasion and subsequent Western sanctions, the only way to stabilize Russia&#x2019;s economy is to end the war and pull its forces out of Ukraine.

Ukraine holds off nearly 50,000 Russian troops in Kursk Oblast, Zelensky says	Ukrainian soldiers are holding off nearly 50,000 troops in Russia&apos;s embattled Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 11. Zelensky&apos;s statement came a day after The New York Times reported that Moscow is preparing to launch an offensive in Kursk Oblast with a force of 50,000 soldiers, both Russian and North Korean. Russia has also deployed thousands of North Korean troops in the embattled region, with some reportedly already clashing with Ukraine in small-scale engagements. Around 11,000 North Korean soldiers were stationed in Kursk Oblast as of Nov. 4. Kyiv launched the surprise offensive into Kursk Oblast in August, with Russian forces have managed to reclaim around half of the territory initially lost. The Kursk incursion was also intended to preempt a Russian plan to invade Sumy Oblast to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; in Ukraine&apos;s north and draw Russian forces away from Donetsk Oblast, where Moscow keeps steadily advancing, the Ukrainian military said. According to Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, Russian forces have suffered 7,905 soldiers killed, 12,220 injured, and 717 captured during the three months of the Kursk offensive. Zelensky has previously said that if Ukraine had permission to use Western long-range weapons against targets deep inside Russia, it could preemptively target &quot;every camp&quot; in Russia where North Korean troops are gathering.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-holds-off-nearly-50-000-russian-troops-in-kursk-oblast-zelensky-says/	2024-11-11T07:20:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166312696.jpg
Russian forces damage Kurakhove Reservoir dam in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine says	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. Russian forces damaged the dam holding the Kurakhove Reservoir in Donetsk Oblast on Nov. 11, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Filashkin&apos;s statement came after multiple reports of the dam being attacked near the village of Stari Terny, some 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the embattled town of Kurakhove. The Kurakhove Reservoir is located on the Vovcha River, with its source near the village of Progress. &quot;This attack potentially threatens residents of settlements on the Vovcha River, both in Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts,&quot; Filashkin said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-damage-dam-of-kurakhove-reservoir-in-donetsk-oblast-ukraine-says/	2024-11-11T07:13:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1407293340.jpg
