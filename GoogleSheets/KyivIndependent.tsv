The Russian targets that could be on Ukraine's long-range missile strike list	In recent weeks, Ukraine's hopes have been buoyed that its Western allies will finally allow their long-range weapons to strike deep into Russian territory. Since the beginning of the full-scale war, Russia has been able to attack Ukraine with relative impunity from its positions behind the border, while the U.S. and other suppliers of weapons have forbidden Ukraine from using their supplied weapons to strike back, often citing fears of escalation. There were signs that the tide was shifting over the past week. The Guardian reported that the U.K. had already decided to allow Ukraine to use its Storm Shadow missiles for strikes in Russia. Politico wrote that the White House reportedly is discussing potential targets Ukraine could strike with its long-range weapons.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken (L) and Britain's Foreign Secretary David Lammy (R) pose with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky (C) at the Mariinsky Palace in Kyiv, Ukraine on Sep. 11, 2024, amid the Russian invasion on Ukraine.

Ukraine has been eagerly awaiting the potential lifting of restrictions, with Defense Minister Rustem Umerov saying in August that he had presented the U.S. with a list of proposed targets within Russia. Calling the lifting of restrictions a 'game changer is probably too strong a word,' Andreas Umland, analyst at the Stockholm Center for Eastern European Studies, told the Kyiv Independent.'But it would make a big difference of course. That's why the Ukrainians are so eager to get it.'Potential targetsA public list of targets — either those requested by Ukraine or approved by the U.S. or the U.K. — is unlikely for operational reasons. Western officials have been hesitant to openly talk about policy changes, likely out of concern that Russia will relocate potentially valuable targets out of reach before Ukraine is able to capitalize on its newfound range capabilities.But matching the ranges of the weapons available to Ukraine, to Russian positions on the other side of the border can shed light on what might be possible should the policy be officially changed. A report from the Institute for the Study of War last month identified 'no fewer than 245 known Russian military and paramilitary sites' within the 300-kilometer range of U.S.-supplied ATACMS, which is currently the furthest range of any Western-supplied missiles available to Ukraine. A map based on data from an Institute for the Study of War (ISW) report on Aug. 27, 2024, which using open-source data, identified 'no fewer than 245 known Russian military and paramilitary objects' within the 300-kilometer range of U.S.-supplied ATACMS, including air bases, headquarters, and training centers. (Institute for the Study of War/ Nizar Al-Rifai/ The Kyiv Independent)If placed close to Ukraine's front lines, the Western-supplied long-range weapons could potentially put vast swathes of Russian territory in the firing zone. The area includes military bases, airfields, troop concentrations, and ammunition depots.Numerous population centers would also be in range, including the cities of Rostov-on-Don (population 1.1 million), Voronezh (population 1 million), Krasnodar (population 1.1 million), Lipetsk (population 496,000), Bryansk (population 350,000), Smolensk (population 310,000), as well as the key port city of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea (population 262,000). This non-exhaustive list does not include cities in occupied Crimea or other parts of Ukraine under Russian control or cities in Russia that have already reportedly come under Ukrainian attack, such as Belgorod. Any change in policies is likely to come with strings attached and with the understanding that long-range strikes will be conducted in a defensive fashion on military targets. Some of the possible military targets in this area could include the following:Lipetsk military air base, struck by drones in AugustShatalovo air base in Smolensk OblastMillerovo military airfield in Rostov Oblast, damaged in a drone strike in JulyYeysk military airfield in Krasnodar Krai, damaged in drone strikes in June and AprilLogistics and command centers in Rostov-on-Don, which has been the central headquarters of Russia's full-scale invasion of UkraineThe Primorsko-Akhtarsk airbase in Krasnodar Krai, regularly used by Russia to launch Shahed-type drones at UkraineNovorossiysk naval base, where much of Russia's Black Sea Fleet has relocated after a series of devastating attacks by Ukraine on its primary base off of occupied CrimeaA damaged car is seen at an undisclosed location in Russia's Belgorod Oblast overnight on Sept. 1, 2024 following a drone attack.

(Screenshot/Radio Free Europe/Wikimapia)Missiles — range and usesUkraine's Western allies have supplied several variants of long-range missiles after initial hesitation at the beginning of the full-scale war — albeit with the caveat that they are used for strikes within Ukraine or in Russian-occupied parts of the country. HIMARS, whose prowess became a popular motif of internet memes, was a game-changer for Ukraine when they first arrived in the summer of 2022.Initially supplied with GMLRS rockets with a range of around 70 kilometers, they allowed Ukraine to target Russian forces on the other side of the front line far more accurately than they had previously.In the fall of 2023, the U.S. began supplying Kyiv with an older model of ATACMS - fired from HIMARS launchers - with a range of around 165 kilometers, greatly increasing the range that Ukraine could strike within.Ukrainian drones strike deeper into Russia, aiming to break war machine, sow discontentJust before sunrise on an otherwise sleepy weekend near Moscow, a Russian eyewitness of Ukraine's kamikaze drone attack on the Kashira Power Plant appeared stunned, unleashing an expletive-laden tirade with his wife alongside. 'They f***g attacked the power plant! Wow, honey!' he said in a video po...The Kyiv IndependentOleg SukhovThe tide began to shift after Russia's renewed offensive in Kharkiv Oblast in May, when the U.S. and other Western allies eased restrictions, allowing Ukraine to strike targets with Western weapons— in a defensive fashion — inside Russia. As the West dithered on its policy about long-range strikes, Ukraine has developed its own domestic arsenal of drones to attack targets inside Russia, hitting airbases, ammunition dumps, drone factories, and other military sites as far as 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) beyond the Ukrainian border. The U.S. began supplying Ukraine with an older model of the Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) in the fall of 2023, which have a range of around 165 kilometers. In the spring of 2024, the New York Times reported that the U.S. had shipped around 100 updated versions of ATACMS missiles, which can reach up to 300 kilometers. Illustrative photo.

(John Keeble/Getty Images)Ukraine has put both variants of missiles into effect on the battlefield, striking targets in occupied Crimea and other parts of Ukraine occupied by Russia. The U.K. began providing Ukraine with its long-range Storm Shadow missiles in May 2023. The missiles have a range of over 250 kilometers. The missiles have been deployed in a number of devastating attacks on Russian targets, such as a strike on the Black Sea Fleet headquarters in occupied Crimea that reportedly killed dozens of Russian soldiers and officers. Although its official list of targets has not been revealed, Ukraine has repeatedly stated that it needs the ability to strike the Russian aircraft that launch mass missile attacks against Ukrainian cities, and the airfields from which they take off.'The Storm Shadow is best used against heavily protected buildings like bunkers or reinforced ammunition storage sites and headquarters,' Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), told the Kyiv Independent, adding: 'It isn't the best use of it to try and hit aircraft out on a runway, or against an airfield that is easy to repair.' 'There are such targets available in Russia, but they'll need to be carefully picked to maximize the impact, ideally timed to coincide with Ukrainian ground operations, destroying supplies that Russian ground units need.'Savill said that the cluster weapon version of ATACMS is ideally suited to striking Russian aircraft at Russian airfields, but added that a recent report that Moscow has already transferred around 90% of its military aircraft to bases outside their reach suggests their effect may now be limited.'This at least means (Russian aircraft) have to operate from further away, and can fly fewer sorties per day,' he said.'There will be Russian forces still in ATACMS range, but essentially it sounds as if the opportunity to do serious damage to the Russian air force on the ground has been missed, for now.'Despite potential missed opportunities, the lifting of restrictions will still be welcomed in Ukraine.'It will certainly make a lot of difference in the war, and will help protect Ukrainian cities from these ongoing missile terror attacks,' Umland said.Russian cities left defenseless as Ukraine ramps up drone attacksWhile waiting for a green light from Western countries to use their long-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia, Ukraine is relying on domestically produced drones, which are considerably cheaper than missiles and no less effective.

Ukrainian military to launch new project in coming months to improve basic training, Syrskyi says	Ukraine is working to improve the training quality for its military, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi announced on Sept. 15, and will roll out new plans over October and November. In a recent working meeting with military leaders and authorities responsible for military training, the group discussed problems related to military training and discussed strategies to solve them, Syrskyi said in a post on Facebook. 'Instructors play a key role in the quality of training. Therefore, we pay maximum attention to attracting motivated instructors with combat experience. We are also working on the possibility of creating an instructor school, which will be the main and only source of well-trained instructors,' Syrskyi wrote. 'We are working on increasing the term of basic combined military training. The corresponding project will be started in October-November of this year,' he added.In July, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the military suffered from a lack of training facilities for new soldiers, citing the Ukrainian military. 'Considering training facilities, there are not enough of them. They are already being expanded,' Zelensky said. Ukraine's parliament adopted an updated mobilization law in mid-April to ramp up mobilization amid Russia's ongoing war. The new law simplifies the process for identifying eligible conscripts and includes additional penalties for those dodging the draft and came into force on May 18.

Russian strike on high-rise in Kharkiv leaves at least 33 injured	Editor's note: This is a developing story.At least 33 people including three children were injured when a Russian air strike hit a high-rise building in Kharkiv city and caused a fire, authorities reported on Sept. 15.President Volodomyry Zelensky shared photos of the damage on his Telegram channel, saying rescue operations where ongoing and that the fire had spread through the 9th through 12th floors. Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Synehubov said three children were among the estimated 25 injured, with the city's mayor, Ihor Terekhov later raising the known total to 33 injured. Shortly before the reported strike, Terekhov warned that Russia had launched several KABs, or guided bombs.

Media: Cyprus revokes citizenship of Ukrainian oligarch Kolomoisky	Cyrpus has stripped Ihor Kolomoisky's Cyrpus citizenship after concluding that the notorious Ukrainian oligarch had withheld vital information related to criminal charges he faces, Philenews reported. Kolomoisky, who was arrested last year in Ukraine, faces trial for alleged fraud, illegal acquisition of property, and money laundering related to his oil and gas holdings. The Prosecutor General's Office announced in May that Kolomoisky was also suspected of ordering the murder of the head of a law firm more than 20 years ago in Crimea.After reviewing the personal information submitted by Kolomoisky to obtain his citizenship under the so-called 'Golden Passport' program, which allows wealthy investors to obtain citizenship through financial investments, the E.U. country determined earlier this month that Kolomoisky's 'suspicious character' risked worsening Cyrpus's reputation, Philenews wrote. Ukraine's Bureau of Economic Security reported that it completed its pre-trial investigation into Kolomoisky on Aug. 21. The prosecutors said that part of the money Kolomoisky allegedly embezzled and transferred to his account, some Hr 2 billion ($48 million), was obtained at the expense of loans from PrivatBank, a Ukrainian bank formerly owned by Kolomoisky.The bureau also said its detectives proved that Kolomoisky had organized the illegal seizure of more than Hr 3.3 billion ($ 80 million) from Ukrnafta, Ukraine's largest oil producer previously affiliated with the oligarch.Kolomoisky, together with five associates, was charged by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) with embezzling Hr 9.2 billion ($223 million) from PrivatBank, the NABU announced on Sept. 7, 2024.Seven other wealthy individuals also lost their citizenship as part of the same review by Cyrpus authorities of personal data submitted during citizenship applications.

Zelensky's office denies report that victory plan includes ceasefire along existing lines	An advisor for President Volodymyr Zelensky denied a news report suggesting Zelensky's new victory plan will include a partial ceasefire, calling it a 'fake.' Zelensky has said he will present the United States with a plan for Ukraine's victory later this month during a meeting with Biden. Responding on Sept. 15 to an article published by Germany's Bild newspaper, Presidential Communications Advisor Dmytro Lytvyn told Ukrainska Pravda, that the claim was untrue.'Bild spread a fake,' Lytvyn said. 'Bild has not seen the victory plan, and of the few people who are currently involved by the president in the preparation of the Victory Plan, none of them spoke to Bild.''Ukraine is against any freezing of the war, and this is said at all levels of the Ukrainian leadership. And it is important for us that the United States supports Ukraine's Victory Plan, not capitulation or freezing,' Lytvyn said. He added that the United States would be the first partner presented with the plan. Officials have so far been tight-lipped about the plan's details. Last month, Zelensky said that Ukraine's operations in Kursk were part of his plan for victory.The other aspects of the plan include Ukraine's participation in the global security infrastructure, pressuring Russia to end the war through diplomatic means, and an economic aspect, Zelensky said without revealing further details.Ukraine is preparing for a second peace summit, following its inaugural global peace summit in Switzerland in June where Russia was excluded.

Russians' faith in their country's safety 'broken' by Ukraine's deep strikes, Budanov says	Ukraine's strikes deep into Russian territory have 'broken' the faith Russian people hold that their country is powerful and safe, Ukraine's military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said on Sept. 14.Speaking during the 20th annual Yalta European Strategy (YES) meeting in Kyiv, Budanov said the strikes have had a 'serious effect on the social-psychological situation,' adding that 'the (Russian) people's belief in that they live in a safe country has been broken. It is the main achievement of all these deep strikes.''The comments come amid intense debate between Ukraine and its allies over the issue of allowing Ukraine to strike Russian territory with foreign-provided weapons. Ukraine has for months requested permission to use foreign weapons to strike within Russian territory, but many partners including the U.S. and Germany have refused over fears of escalation. Ukraine has instead used domestically-produced drones to target Russian cities in mass attacks, ramping up these attacks in recent weeks. The U.S. began providing Ukraine with Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), which have a range of up to 300 kilometers (190 miles), in the spring.While these missiles have been used in Russian-occupied Crimea, Washington's restrictions prevent their use on Russian soil.However, it's understood the stance of Western nations has changed in light of Iran supplying Russia with ballistic missiles, with some reports that the U.K. has already decided to grant Ukraine permission to use Storm Shadows to strike targets deep inside Russia.At the summit, Budanov also expressed concern about North Korea's supply of ballistic missiles to Russia and predicted that Russia may be forced to conduct another wave of mobilization in summer 2025.

Ukrainian military receives 18 Bohdana howitzers financed by Denmark	The Ukrainian military has been handed the 18 Ukrainian-made Bohdana self-propelled howitzers financed by Denmark, Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen announced.Mountable on a number of different truck chassis setups, the Bohdana is the first Ukrainian-made artillery piece to be manufactured in the 155mm NATO-standard caliber.Poulsen made his remarks on Sept. 14 during the 20th annual Yalta European Strategy (YES) meeting in Kyiv, according to the news outlet RBC-Ukraine. The minister added that producing weapons domestically in Ukraine is cheaper and more efficient than in the West, and called on other European countries to do the same. Kyiv has sought to convince allied countries to donate arms to Ukraine's military via direct purchases from Ukrainian companies, as Kyiv's defense budget does not match the capacities of domestic weapons production. A self-propelled howitzer can drive into position, fire off multiple rounds in under a minute, and be out of range of counterfire before the enemy has had time to organize, giving it a speed advantage over artillery units that are towed into place. In development for years before the outset of the full-scale invasion, the Bohdana was first used in combat in summer 2022, firing upon Russian positions on Snake Island in the Black Sea.The order for the 18 Bohdana artillery units was placed in July of this year. In July, the Strategic Industries Ministry said that foreign partners had so far pledged to invest around $675 million in the Ukrainian defense industry to arm Kyiv's forces. 18 Bohdana howitzers heading for Ukraine's battlefield - here's what they can doUkraine's artillery capabilities have received a welcome boost with the news that 18 Ukrainian-made Bohdana howitzers financed by Denmark will be delivered within the coming months.

Biden administration requests extension of nearly $6 billion military funding for Ukraine	U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has requested Congress to extend the authority of 'presidential write-offs' for supplying weapons to Ukraine until 2025, so that the remaining $5.8 billion can be used beyond the fiscal year ending on September 30.Under current rules, the funds will expire if not used by that deadline.The Pentagon is working with Congress to ensure the extension, which would allow continued military aid to Ukraine.If the extension isn't granted, the White House may announce a large aid package by October 1, but this approach could present logistical challenges, such as lack of available resources.Additionally, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken recently announced over $700 million in aid to Ukraine during his visit to Kyiv.The U.S. will provide $325 million to help repair Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which requires strengthening ahead of winter and expectations of a renewed campaign of Russian strikes.The package also includes $290 million in humanitarian aid, which will support 'millions of people in Ukraine and the surrounding region who have been forced to flee their homes,' Blinken said.ATACMS restrictions subject of 'intense consultations' between Ukraine and allies, Sullivan saysATACMS restrictions are 'the subject of intense consultation among allies and partners, and will be (discussed) between President (Biden) and President Zelensky,' U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said.The Kyiv IndependentThe Kyiv Independent news desk	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-administration-requests-extension-of-5-8-billion-military-funding-for-ukraine/	2024-09-14T20:23:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/ezgif-1-86d0505a8b.jpg
Budanov discusses Russia's strategy and North Korean involvement at YES meeting in Kyiv	Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine's military intelligence chief, delivered multiple statements during the 20th annual Yalta European Strategy (YES) meeting in Kyiv.Budanov expressed concern over North Korea's significant military support to Russia, particularly its supply of ballistic missiles.When asked to rank the countries offering the most military support to Russia, Budanov placed North Korea at the top, stating that 'North Korea would be first, then there is no one for a long time, and then everyone else,' highlighting the unmatched volume of supplies North Korea provides.He added that Russia has significantly ramped up its missile production, including Iskander missiles and guided aerial bombs.In another interview, Budanov said that Russia aims to end the war by the end of 2025 or early 2026, due to expected economic and social crises.He noted that by summer 2025, Russia will face serious economic problems and may be forced into further mobilization.'They (Russia) predict that around the summer of 2025, the negative impact on the economy will be very noticeable for their country,' Budanov said. In February 2024, U.S. intelligence estimated that since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Russia has spent up to $211 billion on military operations in Ukraine. The war has cost Russia up to $1.3 trillion in lost economic growth through 2026, an undisclosed source in U.S. intelligence in a comment to Reuters.NATO could have done more to stop Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Stoltenberg saysStoltenberg said the day the war was launched was the worst in his 10-year stint in the role, from which he is stepping down next month.The Kyiv IndependentThe Kyiv Independent news desk	https://kyivindependent.com/budanov-discusses-russias-strategy-and-north-korean-involvement-at-yes-meeting-in-kyiv/	2024-09-14T17:06:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2037956412.jpg

In the summer of 2023, Ukroboronprom said that it had already mastered the production of 82 mm mortar mines, 122 mm, and 152 mm artillery rounds, as well as 125 mm tank shells.Earlier media reports cited Ukrainian officials hoping to begin producing 'desperately needed' NATO-standard 155 mm artillery rounds in the 'second half' of 2024 at the earliest.'This is a very complicated process. This is something that Ukraine has never done before,' Kamyshin said, adding that he 'can't say much' on the matter.Despite domestic efforts, the Ukrainian army still mainly depends on supplying 155 mm shells from partners, as European countries join forces to buy the rounds outside Europe.The U.S. also opened a new factory last May to produce 155 mm munitions for Ukraine and significantly increased production in some existing factories.ATACMS restrictions subject of 'intense consultations' between Ukraine and allies, Sullivan saysATACMS restrictions are 'the subject of intense consultation among allies and partners, and will be (discussed) between President (Biden) and President Zelensky,' U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said.The Kyiv IndependentThe Kyiv Independent news desk	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-launched-production-of-155-mm-artillery-shells-official-says/	2024-09-14T15:06:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/nammo-8.jpg
Germany won't allow long-range strikes on Russia even if other countries do, Scholz says	Germany will not allow Ukraine to launch attacks with German weapons far behind the front 'even if other countries decide otherwise,' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said.His statement comes shortly after U.S. President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stopped short of lifting restrictions on using Western-supplied long-range weapons on Russian territory during their meeting in Washington on Sept. 13, while media continue to report on encouraging signs that the ban might be reversed.Scholz said during the public talk in Prenzlau, Brandenburg that Germany 'will continue to support Ukraine militarily' so that the country 'does not collapse,' German media Welt reported.However, Scholz stressed that he would remain opposed to the idea of Ukraine using German long-range weapons to attack targets deep inside Russia. 'I am sticking to my position, even if other countries decide differently,' Scholz said.Commenting on media reports that the U.S. could lift the existing restrictions, he said that not all speculations are correct, according to Welt.Restrictions on the usage of U.S.-made and provided ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile System) are 'the subject of intense consultation among allies and partners, and will be (discussed) between President (Biden) and President Zelensky,' U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sept. 14.According to earlier media reports on Sept. 11, Biden was said to be finalizing the details of the plan to lift some restrictions, while the U.K. had reportedly privately decided to allow Ukraine to use its British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles for long-range strikes, though no public announcement had been made.Meanwhile, German media Spiegel reported on Sept. 13 that the debate is also ongoing inside the German parliament on whether Ukraine should be provided with German long-range missiles Taurus, with politicians from the FDP and the Greens supporting the decision. Ukraine has long been urging the West to lift the ban on striking military targets deep inside Russia. On Sept. 13, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his speech at the YES conference that without the ability to strike inside Russia, U.S.-provided ATACAMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) are 'pointless.'ATACMS restrictions subject of 'intense consultations' between Ukraine and allies, Sullivan saysATACMS restrictions are 'the subject of intense consultation among allies and partners, and will be (discussed) between President (Biden) and President Zelensky,' U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said.The Kyiv IndependentThe Kyiv Independent news desk	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-wont-allow-long-range-strikes-on-russia-even-if-other-countries-do-scholz-says/	2024-09-14T12:32:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1834521425.jpeg
ATACMS restrictions subject of 'intense consultations' between Ukraine and allies, Sullivan says	Allowing Ukraine to use ATACMS to strike targets deep inside Russia is the subject of 'intense consultations,' U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, said on Sept. 14.Speaking at the Yalta European Strategy conference in Kyiv, Sullivan reiterated that no decision had yet been made, a day after President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer met in Washington to discuss the issue.Ukraine had been hoping for permission to be granted during the talks to use two Western-supplied long-range missiles - Storm Shadow and ATACMS - to strike military targets such as airfields located deep inside Russian territory.But Starmer left Washington with no such announcement being made, putting Kyiv's hopes on hold once again.'I understand Ukraine's perspective on it,' Sullivan said, adding: 'But rather than me trying to elaborate on the reasoning one way or the other, this is something that I think is the subject of intense consultation among allies and partners, and will be (discussed) between President (Biden) and President Zelensky.'Zelensky is due to travel to New York later this month for the United Nations General Assembly.Speaking at the same conference a day earlier, Zelensky said the U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles are 'pointless' in Ukraine due to their limited quantity and restrictions on strikes deep inside Russia imposed by Western partners.The U.S. began providing Ukraine with Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), which have a range of up to 300 kilometers (190 miles), in the spring.While these missiles have been used in Russian-occupied Crimea, Washington's restrictions prevent their use on Russian soil.'ATACMS in the form that we have today (in Ukraine) is pointless if you cannot use it on their (Russian) military bases, airfields with helicopters and airplanes. It's pointless,' Zelensky said.'If ATACMS has a big restriction on the use of missiles because there are few of them... Unfortunately, it doesn't work.'The NYT reported that it's likely a decision will be made about Storm Shadows before one is reached over ATACMS.While Ukraine has been pleading for permission for months, it's understood the stance of Western nations has changed in light of Iran supplying Russia with ballistic missiles.'We've now seen this action of Russia acquiring ballistic missiles from Iran, which will further empower their aggression in Ukraine. So if anyone is taking escalatory action, it would appear to be Mr. Putin and Russia,' U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy, said while visiting Kyiv earlier this week.Lammy added that Iran supplying ballistic missiles to Russia 'clearly changes the debate' around the issue, as it allows the Kremlin to gain 'further penetration into Ukraine.'Zelensky is also expected to present Biden with a plan for Ukraine's victory against Russia, which will also be presented to Vice President Kamala Harris and ex-President Donald Trump, the two candidates for the upcoming November presidential election.'I do think we need a comprehensive strategy for success in this war and that is what President Zelensky says he's bringing,' Sullivan said.'And so we're very much looking forward to sitting down and talking that through, and President Biden is eager for that conversation.'And it's only right that it be President Zelensky who brings that because it is up to the democratically elected government of Ukraine and the people of Ukraine to set out the course of the war, their path to victory.'Russia launches counteroffensive in Kursk - can it push Ukraine off its own turf?More than a month after Ukraine launched an unprecedented incursion into Russian territory, Russian forces have begun counterattacking in Kursk Oblast, aiming to eventually drive Ukrainian troops out of the partially occupied border region.

From strangers to friends: How Ukrainians meet and bond during wartime train travel	For the past eight years, Anton Lytvynov, a stage director at Lviv National Opera, has celebrated New Year in Kyiv with his three friends - Sandra, Mykhailo, and Volodymyr.However, on Dec. 31, 2022, work commitments kept Lytvynov in Lviv longer than he had expected. Determined to reunite with his closest friends all the same, Lytvynov decided to ring in the New Year on the train, planning to meet with them on Jan. 1.Late at night, he traversed the empty, narrow corridor of the Lviv-Kyiv train to his dimly lit yet warm compartment. As the train gradually set off, the sound of its wheels on the tracks built into a steady rumble.Thus began a journey that would prove as exciting as the destination itself.Sitting alone on one of his compartment's dark-red leather beds, Lytvynov overheard people speaking loudly in the compartment next to his.'I went to them to ask if they wanted to celebrate the New Year together, and they agreed,' Lytvynov says.The moment he heard the names of his fellow travelers, Lytvynov was thunderstruck: The people sitting next to him were named Sandra, Mykhailo, and Volodymyr - just like the friends he was traveling to see.People on the escalator at the railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine, on June 12, 2024.

(Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)Railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine, on June 12, 2024. (Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)'It felt like a scene from a TV series,' Lytvynov laughs. The four bonded instantly, exchanged contact information, and remain in touch to this day.Since Ukraine shut down its airports in February 2022, trains operated by the state-owned railway, Ukrzaliznytsia, have become one of the primary and perhaps the easiest means of travel both within Ukraine and abroad. Countless fascinating encounters and stories unfolded in the corridors and compartments of Ukrainian trains since then.Tetiana Kohut, a 37-year-old train attendant, often sees strangers find common ground while traveling. It's not surprising, she notes: in the intimate space of a train compartment during long journeys, shared everyday rituals - like sleeping or sipping tea - create a cozy atmosphere, naturally fostering connections among passengers.Trains have also evolved into unexpected hubs for celebrity encounters and important connections, often paving the way to shared projects and other new opportunities.War changes everythingSince the start of Russia's full-scale war, Ukrainian trains have borne witness to more tears of sorrow, sadness, and grief than ever before.Just a day after Russian troops began heavily bombarding Ukrainian cities in late February 2022, Kohut was working on her regular route from Lviv, her hometown, to Novooleksiivka in Kherson Oblast. But her train never reached the destination. The village, located on the east bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson Oblast, was swiftly occupied by the Russians.'We reached Zaporizhzhia and were told that we could not go further,' Kohut says. 'We also were ordered to allow everyone on the train, not only those with tickets. We became an evacuation train.'A train attendant of nearly 20 years, Kohut heard the sounds of explosions for the first time that day in Zaporizhzhia. She also saw hundreds of people at the station. Many of them were crying, and others looked lost and heartbroken, leaving suitcases on the platform as they boarded the lifesaving train to escape the war.The first-class sleeping car she worked in was designed to accommodate 20 people but ended up carrying nearly 200, Kohut says. 'A woman from Zaporizhzhia helped me count the passengers and wrote a heartwarming letter to thank us.'People walk to the railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine, on June 12, 2024. (Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)Train attendant Tetiana Kohut checks the tickets of passengers before departure to Lviv at a railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine on June 12, 2024. (Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)The start of the all-out war changed everything for Kohut and many other train attendants across Ukraine. In the first few months of the invasion, they worked without breaks, despite their exhaustion, to ensure everyone who wanted to escape the war could board their trains. The war also heightened the hazards of their work, as Russian attacks occasionally target train stations. Over 600 Ukrzaliznytsia employees have been killed since Feb. 24, 2022.Kohut says she lost colleagues in the Aug. 24, 2022 Russian attack on Chaplyne, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, when a passenger train and a residential area were hit, killing a total of 25 people. One of her close friends, a fellow train attendant, was seriously injured in the attack.Once filled with laughter and excitement for upcoming travels, the train cars are now often filled with crying, silence, or the heavy sighs of people sharing the pain brought by Russia's war. 'We have to be doctors... We have to be psychologists for our passengers now,' says Kohut.Despite the dangers, trains have been also the primary means of traveling to Ukraine for many of the world's top politicians and celebrities, with over 700 diplomatic missions arriving in Ukraine by train since the start of the invasion.U.S. President Joe Biden walks along the train platform after a surprise visit to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in Kyiv, Ukraine on Feb. 20, 2023.

(EU Commission/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Kohut has had the fortune to work on many such routes, and has met former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Polish President Andrzej Duda, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and others.'Right now, all the world-famous celebrities are traveling (to Ukraine) by train. I only ever saw them on TV before, and serving them now is just so pleasant, it's indescribable,' says Kohut.Unexpected tearsA chance encounter on a train initially brought tears to the eyes of Kyiv resident Olha Hrianyk, and led her to experience grief she thought she would never endure again.Hrianyk, 63, and her husband were traveling from Chernivtsi to the capital last May when a tall young man entered their compartment. The couple noticed a very familiar and cherished unit badge on his backpack.''Are you from the Azov brigade?' My husband asked,' Hrianyk recalls. 'He said: 'How do you know?'''I told him that our son was an Azov fighter.'Hrianyk's son Oleksandr helped liberate Kyiv Oblast in the early months of the full-scale war. He was then transferred to defend Mariupol, ending up at the Azovstal steel plant, the last Ukrainian stronghold in the city, where he was killed on May 8, 2022. He was 29.Evening railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine on June 12, 2024. (Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)Train attendant Tetiana Kohut before departure to Lviv at the railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine on June 12, 2024. (Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)Vladyslav, the young man they accidentally met on the train, was undergoing training to join Azov. Some of his commanders had known Hrianyk's son Oleksandr well: 'He told us it was a great honor for him to meet us,' Hrianyk says.The elderly couple and the young soldier talked until late at night, opening their hearts and sharing stories about military service and the war: 'I looked at him thinking, 'Son, you're so bright, you're so proud to be there (in Azov). What amazing young people we have,'' says Hrianyk.'In that brief time, that child became like family to me.'They shared phone numbers and kept in touch with Vladyslav while he was undergoing military training in Kyiv, often inviting him over for dinner or simply to rest after being on duty.One day last September, Vladyslav's mother suddenly called Hrianyk, expressing relief at finally contacting the couple her son had accidentally met on the train and had told her a lot about. But then she delivered some heartbreaking news: Vladyslav had been killed in combat near Bakhmut. He was only 19.'We printed his portrait and put it at the fallen soldiers' memorial (next to the St. Michael's Cathedral in Kyiv). (The portrait of) our Oleksandr is there too,' Hrianyk says.'Now, as we come there to see our Sasha, we come to see Vlad, too.'Turning words into actionsFor many Ukrainians, meetings on trains have sparked new ideas and fruitful collaborations for their projects or businesses.Vinnytsia-based Nataliia Kovalchuk, a content creator for an NGO called the National Network of Local Philanthropy Development, recalls numerous captivating experiences during her work trips across Ukraine.People talk on the phones inside the train on the railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine on June 12, 2024. (Danylo Pavlov / The Kyiv Independent)'My team laughs at me when I say, 'You'll never believe it, but I met someone on the train again,'' Kovalchuk says.During her railway journeys, Kovalchuk always buys a cup of hot tea - a true gem of Ukrainian train travel, served by train attendants in a special glass with a metal cup holder. Little did she know that accidentally spilling her tea onto a nearby passenger's belongings would lead to another valuable connection.Surprisingly, the spilled tea did not lead to bad feelings, but helped Kovalchuk bond with the woman whose belongings she had soaked. It turned out that the woman worked at a center for the physical and psychological rehabilitation of Ukrainian soldiers.Kovalchuk donated some books for the soldiers undergoing rehabilitation there and helped the center boost its social media presence to attract more funding in the future.Now she is planning to invite some of the war veterans from the center to give a lecture to local young people and her organization on inclusivity and treatment of people with disabilities in Ukraine.And all this became possible thanks to a chance encounter on a train.As the evening comes down, people walk to the railway station in Kyiv, Ukraine, on June 12, 2024.

3 killed in Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia Oblast, governor says	A Russian attack killed three civilians in the Huliaipole community, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, regional governor Ivan Fedorov reported on Sept. 14.Fedorov said in a statement on social media that Russian forces struck the territory of an agricultural enterprise, without specifying the type of weapon used. All three victims were the enterprise's employees, he added.The front-line community of Huliaipole has about 20,000 residents. It has been subjected to constant attacks from Russian positions in the south over the course of the full-scale Russian invasion. The town lies less than 10 kilometers north of the front line and some 90 kilometers (56 miles) southeast of the regional center, Zaporizhzhia.Fedorov reported earlier that Huliaipole was attacked with artillery and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) of different modifications over the past day. https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-returns-103-pows-including-23-azov-fighters/	https://kyivindependent.com/governor-3-killed-in-russian-attack-on-zaporizhzhia-oblast/	2024-09-14T09:35:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/photo_2024-09-03_00-04-14.jpg

NATO could have done more to stop Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Stoltenberg says	NATO could have provided Ukraine with more arms to prevent Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the bloc's Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg, said in an interview published Sept. 14.'Now we provide military stuff to a war — then we could have provided military stuff to prevent the war,' he told the German newspaper FAS.Stoltenberg said the day the war was launched was the worst in his 10-year stint in the role, from which he is stepping down next month. Former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, will take his place.'I wasn't surprised because we knew from the intelligence services what was going to happen,' he said.'But seeing it actually happen still shocked me. I realized that this was a turning point in our history: There is a Europe before that day and a different Europe after that day.'Stoltenberg highlighted NATO's reluctance to send weapons Ukraine was asking for before the launch of the full-scale invasion, over Western fears of escalation, something which continues to this day and has led to long delays in weapons systems such as tanks and fighter jets.He also said the war would only end with 'dialogue with Russia at a certain stage,' but added it 'has to be based on Ukrainian strength.'Stoltenberg has consistently urged NATO allies to increase defense spending amid risks of fracturing among the alliance. Multiple NATO countries, including Slovakia and Hungary have questioned NATO's commitment to supporting Ukraine in the war, calling instead for a peace agreement.During the recent NATO summit in Washington, the alliance clarified Ukraine's 'irreversible' path toward NATO by emphasizing the alliance's ongoing commitments to Kyiv 'constitute a bridge to Ukraine's membership.'NATO allies also announced plans to provide Ukraine with a minimum baseline funding of 40 billion euros ($43 billion), a new military command in Germany to train and equip Ukrainian troops, and further air defense commitments.Ukraine's long-range missile strike hopes on hold once again but encouraging signs remainUkraine's hopes of being allowed to use Western-supplied long range missiles to strike deep inside Russian territory were put on hold once again on Sept. 13, after the leaders of the U.S. and U.K. stopped short of making the announcement Kyiv wanted.

Ukraine's long-range missile strike hopes on hold once again but encouraging signs remain	Ukraine's hopes of being allowed to use Western-supplied long range missiles to strike deep inside Russian territory were put on hold once again on Sept. 13, after the leaders of the U.S. and U.K. stopped short of making the announcement Kyiv wanted.Anticipation had been high ahead of meetings between President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Washington, but the White House dampened expectations even before the pair had finished talks.'There is no change to our view on the provision of long-range strike capabilities for Ukraine to use inside of Russia,' National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters.Ukraine was hoping for permission to use two Western-supplied long range missiles that it already possesses to strike military targets such as airfields located deep inside Russian territory.With the bans in place, Kyiv says it cannot effectively defend Ukrainian cities from intensifying aerial attacks.The two missiles are the U.S.-supplied ATACMS, a short-range supersonic tactical ballistic missile, and the U.K.-France-supplied Storm Shadow.Both Storm Shadows and ATACMS were initially given to Kyiv on the provision that they only be used to strike Russian targets within Ukraine or in Russian-occupied parts of the country.Western fears of escalating the war with Russia have been behind the restrictions.The tide began to shift after Russia's renewed offensive in Kharkiv Oblast in May, when the U.S. and other Western allies eased restrictions, allowing Ukraine to strike targets with Western weapons— in a defensive fashion — inside Russia.In the lead up to Starmer and Biden meeting on Sept. 13, multiple media reports suggested both countries might be on the verge of allowing Kyiv to use their long-range weapons to strike targets deep in Russian territory.According to Politico, on Sept. 11, Biden was said to be finalizing the details of a plan to lift some restrictions.On the same day, the Guardian reported that the U.K. had already privately decided to allow Ukraine to use its British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles for long-range strikes, though no public announcement had been made at the time.Hopes were understandably high that an announcement would come after the meeting between Biden and Starmer.Speaking to reporters at the White House, Starmer said the meeting with Biden had been a 'wide-ranging discussion about strategy' rather than a decision-making process about 'a particular capability.''We've had a long and productive discussion on a number of problems, including Ukraine, as you'd expect, the Middle East, and the Indo-Pacific, talking strategically about tactical decisions,' he said.According to reports, the U.K. has already decided to grant Ukraine permission to use Storm Shadows to strike targets deep inside Russia.The White House said the meeting between the two leaders was called at the request of the U.K., and according to The New York Times (NYT), Britain wants explicit permission from Biden so a coordinated strategy can be presented.While Kirby was very clear that a decision was not coming on Sept, 13, he didn't rule out that one could be made in the near future.According to the Guardian, Starmer suggested the plan would be further discussed 'with a wider group of individuals' at the UN general assembly in New York later this month.The NYT reported that it's likely a decision will be made about Storm Shadows before one is reached over ATACMS.While Ukraine has been pleading for permission for months, it's understood the stance of Western nations has changed in light of Iran supplying Russia with ballistic missiles.'We've now seen this action of Russia acquiring ballistic missiles from Iran, which will further empower their aggression in Ukraine. So if anyone is taking escalatory action, it would appear to be Mr. Putin and Russia,' U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy, said while visiting Kyiv earlier this week.Lammy added that the Iran supplying ballistic missiles to Russia 'clearly changes the debate' around the issue, as it allows the Kremlin to gain 'further penetration into Ukraine.'Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials have upped their saber-rattling in response, claiming that the move would mean NATO is directly at war with Russia.'I do not think much about Vladimir Putin,' Biden said when asked on Sept. 13 what he thought about the Russian president's remarks.The long-range missiles Ukraine could soon be firing deep into RussiaThe U.S. and U.K. may be on the verge of what could be a hugely significant move regarding the war in Ukraine, with reports suggesting both countries might soon allow Kyiv to use their long-range weapons to strike targets deep in Russian territory.

Zelensky reveals details of July call with Trump, says he claimed to be 'very supportive'	President Volodymyr Zelensky has revealed Donald Trump told him during a call in July he is 'very supportive,' and would do 'everything to strengthen Ukraine' if elected president.In a preview clip of an interview with CNN to be aired on Sept. 15, Zelensky said Trump also told him 'he understands how difficult it is to survive during the war.'The comments are at odds with Trump's previous public statements on Ukraine.During the presidential debate on Sept. 10, the former president reiterated earlier statements that his primary concern was ending the war - which he has previously claimed he could do in 24 hours - but refrained from providing any concrete details.Media reports indicated that Trump privately suggested he would end Russia's war by pressuring Ukraine to cede occupied Crimea and Donbas to Moscow. He voiced strong criticism of American aid to Ukraine at a campaign rally in Detroit on June 15, describing Zelensky as 'maybe the greatest salesman of any politician that's ever lived' for securing substantial financial support from the U.S.The U.S. has provided historic levels of foreign aid to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, sending over $100 billion in military assistance and budget support critical to fighting off Russia and helping the government continue to operate.During the debate, Trump also refused to answer whether Ukraine being victorious was in the best interests of the U.S., instead insisting that it was in America's 'best interest to get this war finished and negotiate a deal.'Trump's vice-presidential running mate Sen. J.D. Vance said in an interview on Sept. 12 that Donald Trump's plan to end Russia's war could include the establishment of a special demilitarized zone between Ukraine and Russia, among other arrangements.When asked by CNN's Fareed Zakaria how Zelensky understands Trump's comments that he would end the war in 24 hours, Zelensky dismissed the comments as 'election messages,' that may not reflect what his actual policies will be if he is elected president.'I can't understand it for today because I don't know the details — what he means and what does it mean,' Zelensky said, referring to Trump's alleged plan.'My position is that the election period and election messages are election messages. Sometimes they are not very real,' Zelensky said during a clip of the interview, which is set to be fully published on Sept. 15.Zelensky did however acknowledge that Trump's statements have made some Ukrainians 'nervous.'Zelensky will visit the U.S. later this month to present President Joe Biden with a 'victory plan,' which he told CNN would also be presented to Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump, ahead of the upcoming November presidential election.Ukrainian officials, including Zelensky, have stressed that Kyiv will continue to cooperate productively with any U.S. administration, regardless of the outcome of the November election.Is 'Russians at War' propaganda?

Red Cross says it has suspended operations at Dnipro office following attack that killed, injured employees	A spokesperson for the Ukrainian delegation of the International Committee of the Red Cross says that the organization has suspended operations at its Dnipro office after three of its employees were killed in a strike on Sept. 12.Russian forces attacked the village of Viroliubivka near Kostiantynivka, hitting the territory of the enterprise, Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin said.The attack destroyed a truck with humanitarian aid and a car, killing three employees of the International Committee of the Red Cross mission and injuring two others.'For now, our Dnipro office has suspended operations for some time,' Spokesperson Oleksandr Vlasenko said following the attack. Vlasenko did not specify when the office is expected to reopen. Although the attack did not target the office, regular Russian attacks on the region have continued to pose a serious risk to Red Cross employees stationed along the front line.In a statement, the Red Cross said that its team was preparing to distribute firewood and fuel briquettes north of Donetsk to residents when the attack occurred.Had the employees been actively distributing the materials when the attack occurred, 'there could have been much more casualties,' Vlasenko said.The Red Cross has not pointed the blame on Russia for the attack, with Vlasenko adding that the organization 'does not know exactly' who has committed the attack. In response to the Red Cross' hesitation to directly blame Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said it was 'disappointing to see that the Red Cross, in its official communication afraid to even say it was a Russian strike.''This is our life, but it's their face. And this is not just the truth - it's a Russian strike - it is Russian terror,' Zelensky added.Russia has regularly attacked the regions lying on Ukraine's easter front with missile, guided bomb, and drones. Earlier on the day on Sept. 12, Russian forces attacked the Kostiantynivka community in Donetsk Oblast and the village of Borova in Kharkiv Oblast, killing five people and injuring at least nine, local authorities reported.3 Red Cross employees killed, 2 injured in Russian attack on Donetsk OblastRussian forces attacked the Kostiantynivka community in Donetsk Oblast and the village of Borova in Kharkiv Oblast on Sept. 12, killing five people and injuring at least nine, local authorities reported.The Kyiv IndependentKateryna Denisova	https://kyivindependent.com/red-cross-says-it-has-suspended-operations-at-dnipro-office-following-attack-that-killed-injured-employees/	2024-09-13T20:29:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/Red-Cross.jpg
