Ukraine forced to fight against North Korea in Europe,' Zelensky says	During his evening address on Oct. 26, President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that North Korean troops may appear fighting alongside Russian forces on the front line in the coming days. &quot;(Russia is) increasingly engaging North Korea as an ally, and any day now their soldiers may appear on the battlefield fighting against Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Ukraine will be forced to actually fight against North Korea in Europe.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s comments come amid reports that the Biden administration believes that a contingent of North Korean troops is en route to Russia&#x2019;s Kursk region to assist Moscow in countering a Ukrainian offensive launched there in August. Zelensky said on Oct. 25, citing intelligence reports, that Russia is planning to send the first North Korean soldiers to a combat zone on Oct. 27-28. These soldiers are reportedly receiving training at five military training grounds in Ekaterinoslavka, Knyaze-Volkonskoe, and Sergeevka, as well as in Ussuriysk and Ulan-Ude in eastern Russia. Although U.S. officials have not confirmed South Korean reports that North Korean soldiers will engage in direct combat, they estimate the North Korean force could number in the thousands and may rapidly be assigned to combat roles, the Wall Street Journal reports. Estimates on the number of North Korean troops sent to the Ukraine-Russia front line have varied. U.S. officials estimated around 3,000 North Korean troops were training in Russia, but National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby indicated that the overall count could now be higher. South Korean intelligence has informed lawmakers that North Korean troop numbers in Russia could reach 10,000 by December, while Kyiv has said that Pyongyang has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals. Speaking during his evening address, Zelensky called on Western allies to commit to &quot;stronger decisions in support of Ukraine,&quot; as the threat of the war&apos;s escalation continues to rise. &quot;The world is capable of stopping the war from unfolding. Abstractions and words are not enough for this &#x2013; concrete steps are needed.&quot; On Oct. 24, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said that the country could review its ban on supplying lethal arms to Ukraine in light of &quot;North Korean military activities.&quot; South Korean law prohibits the exporting of weapons to active conflict zones, but Seoul has repeatedly hinted that this could change in light of deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-forced-to-fight-against-north-korea-in-europe-zelensky-says/	2024-10-26T14:04:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029588238--1-.jpg
Georgian ruling party secures majority with 70% of precincts counted, official results show	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Georgia&#x2019;s ruling Georgian Dream party captured 53% of the vote in the Oct. 26 parliamentary election, with 70% of precincts counted, according to the country&apos;s central electoral commission. The commission reported that the final voter turnout reached 58.94%. Some 3.5 million Georgians were eligible to cast ballots in the polls. Meanwhile, the opposition claimed victory in the election. The European Union has cautioned that this election will shape Georgia&#x2019;s prospects for joining the 27-nation bloc. Polls indicate that most Georgians support EU membership, but accession talks stalled after Georgian Dream passed a law in June that restricts freedom of speech. Election monitors reported various violations across the country, including ballot stuffing and voter intimidation. Less than an hour before polls closed, President Salome Zourabichvili, known for her pro-Western stance, urged opposition voters not to be intimidated. &quot;Don&apos;t get scared. All this is just psychological pressure on you,&quot; she said in a live address on social media.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-ruling-party-secures-majority-with-70-of-precincts-counted-official-results-show/	2024-10-26T12:07:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2180430600-1.jpg
Ukraine hopes Washington will support Kyiv's NATO bid after elections, as opposition in Europe persists	The desire to receive an official invitation to NATO tops President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s victory plan. While acknowledging that membership itself is a matter for after the war, Zelensky urged allies to send an invitation before U.S. President Joe Biden leaves office in January. The president also said that Ukraine needs to receive an invitation without conditions to cede territory, denying earlier reports that Kyiv might be invited to the alliance without the occupied parts of the country, such as Donetsk and Crimea. But despite the ambitious request, there seems to be little appetite for a fast-tracked invitation while the war is ongoing. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz proclaimed that NATO cannot &quot;become a party of war.&quot; Even if Kyiv sways the hesitant heavyweights &#x2013; U.S. and Germany &#x2013; Ukraine-skeptic governments in Hungary and Slovakia remain a vocal obstacle. In total, at least seven NATO countries are reluctant to grant Ukraine an invitation to join NATO, Politico reported on Oct. 23. Even if that hurdle is overcome, further down the road lies a drawn-out accession process that requires ratification by all the 32 parliaments. &quot;We are talking about a very, very long future,&quot; Volodymyr Ogrysko, Ukraine&apos;s former foreign minister, told the Kyiv Independent. Kyiv applied for membership in September 2022 as Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion was in full swing. Despite Ukraine knocking on the door for two years, the alliance has been hesitant to give a clear signal. Ogrysko was nevertheless crystal clear about why Ukraine needs full membership: &quot;Otherwise, it will be only an invitation for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin to repeat this in one or two years&#x2026;And I don&apos;t know why our Western colleagues really do not understand that.&quot; &quot;I would say that at best, extending an invitation could potentially happen relatively quickly following a favorable U.S. election,&quot; Camille Grand, a security and NATO expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Formal accession would follow the post-hot phase of the conflict,&quot; he added. The Vilnius Summit communique from last year stated that Ukraine would &quot;join the Alliance when Allies agree and conditions are met.&quot; This vague promise was reiterated this year during the allied gathering in Washington, though it was &quot;upgraded&quot; by saying that Ukraine&apos;s path toward NATO is &quot;irreversible.&quot; These lukewarm pledges come as little surprise. As the allies remain divided on the issue, the 32-member consensus necessary for inviting and admitting a new member remains far off. Kyiv&apos;s NATO prospects have received clear support from at least some allies, namely those on the eastern flank like Poland and the Baltic states. &quot;We see confident support from France. We understand that Britain will support us, and we believe that Italy will as well,&quot; Zelensky said during a press briefing on Oct. 21 attended by the Kyiv Independent. The president nevertheless acknowledged reluctance from some members. The U.S. and Germany, NATO&apos;s largest economies and leading suppliers of military assistance to Ukraine, have represented the main opposition to Kyiv&apos;s fast accession. While Washington was once the leading force behind NATO enlargement, the Biden administration took a much more careful approach, which some observers ascribe to the president&apos;s &quot;Cold War mentality&quot; and fears of an escalation with Russia.

(Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/ AFP via Getty Images)And even if Biden were to change his position, &quot;there remains&#x2026;real opposition coming from Hungary but also countries more supportive of Ukraine, (such) as Germany,&quot; Grand said. &quot;I, therefore&#x2026; do not expect an invitation to be granted in the short term, even though I believe it would be a powerful signal,&quot; the expert noted. Speaking after meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Kyiv, Zelensky said that he hopes for a more &quot;positive reaction&quot; from Washington after the election. He also believes that U.S. support could nudge other reluctant parties, such as Germany, Slovakia, and Hungary, in a more positive direction. There have been conflicting reports on the current mood in Washington. While the French outlet Le Monde wrote that Biden might be open to an invitation if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the election in November. Politico reports that the opposition on the other side of the Atlantic persists. Getting Washington on board would certainly put strong pressure on other members but would not ensure an immediate invitation. In Berlin, the mood is tepid at best. Speaking to German public broadcaster ZDF on Oct. 24, the chancellor dismissed the &#xA0;appeal for an immediate invitation, adding that a &quot;country at war absolutely cannot become a member of NATO.&quot; &quot;German skepticism about our joining NATO is a fact,&quot; Zelensky acknowledged. Finally, there are the wildcards of Hungary and Slovakia, both led by populist leaders who have repeatedly criticized military assistance for Ukraine over fears of being dragged into the war. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban called Zelensky&apos;s victory plan &quot;terrifying,&quot; his Slovak counterpart Robert Fico vowed that he would block Ukraine&apos;s membership as long as he is in office.

(Tobias Schwarz / AFP via Getty Images)But experience shows that despite fiery rhetoric, Bratislava has rarely broken Western consensus on key policy issues. Budapest did, along with Turkey, block the accession of Finland and Sweden but eventually withdrew its opposition after gaining some benefits. &quot;I can imagine that Hungary will make some requests regarding the Hungarian minority in (Ukraine&apos;s) Zakarpattia Oblast,&quot; Pavel Havlicek, a research fellow at the Prague-based Association for International Affairs, told the Kyiv Independent. In a similar fashion, Budapest has used the 75,000-large Hungarian minority in Ukraine&apos;s westernmost region to hamper Kyiv&apos;s EU accession. &quot;Of course, we know how it went with Sweden and Finland&#x2026; in the end, it was only a matter of time before the pressure from the alliance was too strong,&quot; Havlicek added, noting that Bratislava is even less likely to put up real resistance due to its security dependence on the U.S. Nevertheless, Budapest has more reasons to obstruct Ukraine&apos;s invitation and entry than it did with the two Nordic countries. &quot;As criticism of Ukraine and the pro-peace narrative have become such core parts of Fidesz&apos;s (Hungary&apos;s ruling party) politics, it is much harder to imagine that the current Hungarian National Assembly would ratify Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO,&quot; says Patrik Szicherle, a research fellow at the Globsec think tank. &quot;This does not mean Hungary would never agree, but I think it would take a longer time to convince the public that it would benefit Hungary.&quot; According to Politico&apos;s sources, other countries, like Belgium, Slovenia, or Spain, are also averse to a quick invite for Ukraine but are less vocal about it, hiding in Berlin and Washington&apos;s shadow. &quot;Unfortunately, I think that the political support within NATO is not strong enough at this time,&quot; said James Goldgeier, a professor at the American University in Washington D.C. and an expert on NATO enlargement. Voicing skepticism about Biden actually changing his position, Goldgeier added: &quot;The biggest question is what approach would a Harris administration take if she were to win the election. I don&apos;t think we know that yet.&quot; Harris did not publicly commit to pushing Ukraine&apos;s NATO bid forward. Nor did her Republican challenger, Donald Trump, whose potential return to the White House prompts fears of the U.S. decreasing or canceling its support of Ukraine. Even if Kyiv manages to muster support among all 32 members, Zelensky acknowledged that the actual membership will have to wait until the end of the war. The military outcome of the full-scale war is unclear, but the current situation seems to favor Russia and makes it unlikely that Ukraine will be able to liberate all of its territories in the near future. While Ukraine&apos;s allies have publicly avowed commitment to its territorial integrity, the present situation led to some speculations about more &quot;realistic&quot; pathways toward NATO membership. Speaking to the Financial Times, former NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg proposed a &quot;West German solution,&quot; suggesting that the alliance&apos;s Article 5 could extend only to territories held by Kyiv. The areas occupied by Russia would be de facto left outside of the alliance without officially acknowledging them as Russian. Some media reports also suggested that some in the West are considering the possibility of Ukraine temporarily trading its territory for NATO membership. Talking to the Kyiv Independent, Grand said that while he fully supports Ukraine restoring its territorial integrity, &quot;full control over the entire territory should, however, not be a prerequisite for joining NATO.&quot; A soldier looks at a fire caused by artillery fire in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine on July 29, 2024. (Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)The expert said that the West Germany solution &quot;proved a good decision for the Alliance, for Germany and for European security&quot; and &quot;some lessons of this experience could apply to Ukraine.&quot; Others, like historian Timothy Garton Ash, pointed out differences in the German and Ukrainian starting points. Unlike Russian-occupied Ukraine, East Germany was not being &quot;brutally Russified,&quot; he wrote in an op-ed in the Financial Times. Oleksiy Melnyk, the co-director of Kyiv-based think tank Razumkov Center, said such a decision would not be the most &quot;favorable scenario,&quot; but it is not unfeasible if the allies provide enough military power to back it up. He also mollified fears that accepting Ukraine into NATO would automatically mandate the allies to put boots on the ground. Extending the invitation and accepting Ukraine would be powerful by itself as it would impose strategic uncertainty on the Kremlin: &quot;We don&apos;t have to (send our soldiers). But we have the right at any moment to do so.&quot; Indeed, Article 5 requires the allies merely to take &quot;such action as (they) deem necessary&quot; to safeguard collective security but does not dictate a full-blown military response. At least publicly, Kyiv has been adamant that it will not compromise on territory or sovereignty. Commenting on the possibility of entering NATO without occupied territories, Zelensky said that &quot;no matter what path we take, legally, no one will recognize the occupied territories as territories of other states.&quot; The Ukrainian president noted that he was not approached directly with the NATO-for-territory proposals but believes some partners are sending these signals through the media. &quot;I think that in this case, everything depends on Ukrainian society,&quot; Zelensky said. A survey conducted in May 2024 showed that 55% of Ukrainians opposed territorial concession. While still constituting a majority, it was a drop from 65% and 74% in February 2024 and December 2023. In the same poll, roughly half of the respondents were open to the possibility of Russia de facto holding on to some occupied territories if Ukraine can join NATO and gain real security guarantees. Ukrainian political analyst Mykola Davydiuk said that if NATO is actually considering the West German scenario, it needs to make the offer officially, but it must also understand how Russia would react to such a step.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hopes-washington-will-support-kyivs-nato-bid-after-elections-as-opposition-in-europe-persists/	2024-10-26T11:52:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2161663204-1.jpg
Both sides declare victory in Georgia's pivotal vote on European future	Competing exit polls indicate that Georgia&#x2019;s increasingly authoritarian ruling party, Georgian Dream, is positioned to lead in a crucial election on the nation&#x2019;s European future. However, the polls diverge on which side could secure a majority. The ruling Georgian Dream party, led by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, and opposition groups aiming to end the party&#x2019;s 12-year rule declared victory on Oct. 26. Opposition-aligned TV channels reported Georgian Dream with 40.9% of the vote, while the combined total for four opposition groups was at 51.9%. Meanwhile, the pro-government Imedi TV gave Georgian Dream a higher 56%. Under Georgia&#x2019;s updated electoral system, the party with at least half the vote claims half of the 150 seats in parliament. Although Georgia achieved EU candidate status last December, the European Union has since suspended the process due to &quot;democratic backsliding&quot; and the passage of a Russian-style &quot;foreign influence&quot; law targeting groups receiving Western funding. Election monitors reported various violations across the country, including ballot stuffing and voter intimidation. Less than an hour before polls closed, President Salome Zourabichvili, known for her pro-Western stance, urged opposition voters not to be intimidated. &quot;Don&apos;t get scared. All this is just psychological pressure on you,&quot; she said in a live address on social media. Large numbers of Georgians participated in the election on Oct. 26, despite reports of violence near polling stations. Two people were hospitalized, and Georgian Dream supporters attacked the headquarters of the main opposition party, BBC reported. In one incident, an opposition official south of Tbilisi told the BBC he was first assaulted by a local Georgian Dream council member and then by &quot;another 10 men came and I didn&#x2019;t know what was happening to me.&quot; The opposition has framed this high-stakes vote as a choice between Europe and Russia. Should the exit polls favoring the opposition prove accurate, they could end Georgian Dream&#x2019;s 12-year tenure. Final projected results are expected soon.	https://kyivindependent.com/both-sides-declare-victory-in-georgias-pivotal-vote-on-european-future/	2024-10-26T10:16:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2180410629.jpg
Final pre-election push to boost ‘heartland’ US support for Ukraine proves difficult	PARMA, Ohio &#x2014; After serving nearly three months in the Ukrainian Foreign Legion, a unit within the country&#x2019;s army comprised of fighters from abroad, Manus McCaffery is known as a hometown hero in Parma, Ohio, home to one of the largest diaspora communities in the U.S. with roots from Ukraine. Months into Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched in 2022, the now 23-year-old U.S. veteran was wounded in Ukraine&#x2019;s Zaporizhzhia Oblast. He dedicated the subsequent years to another way of supporting Ukraine &#x2013; by fundraising for its armed forces in Parma. As part of his mission to expand support for Ukraine among fellow Ohio conservatives, McCaffery joined a discussion organized by the German Marshall Fund of the United States in Parma this October, less than a month from the U.S. presidential election. The event was part of the fund&#x2019;s &#x201C;Whistlestops for Ukraine&#x201D; tour, a year-long effort to rally support for Kyiv. A Parma, Ohio veteran who served in Ukraine&#x2019;s foreign legion, Manus McCaffery (C) remains undecided on his vote for the U.S. president on Nov. 5. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)Yet even McCaffery himself is torn over how he will vote in the Nov. 5 election: for the status quo in terms of U.S. backing for Ukraine, namely President Joe Biden&apos;s Vice President Kamala Harris on the Democratic Party ticket, or Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has openly questioned further allyship with Kyiv and has a history of fancy for Russian President Vladimir Putin. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m extremely uncertain, it&#x2019;s tough because I want to balance what I think is best for America, but also, in a lot of ways, I&apos;m a one-issue person because I care about Ukraine so much,&#x201D; McCaffery told the Kyiv Independent. It would have been easier, he added, for him to vote for Biden over Harris, who he says is too progressive on domestic issues. The veteran of Ukraine and U.S. armed services said his vote would be a last-minute decision. With the U.S. presidential election days away and 40% of Trump supporters saying Washington should &#x201C;reconsider&#x201D; its level of backing for Ukraine, the Ohio stop showed how challenging the German Marshall Fund&#x2019;s mission of increasing support for Ukraine is. Since last November, the German Marshall Fund, a Washington-based research group that promotes democracy, has visited eight &#x201C;heartland&#x201D; U.S. states in a public diplomacy initiative dubbed &#x201C;Whistlestops for Ukraine.&#x201D; The tour has primarily focused on Democratic city centers surrounded by conservative rural areas and ideologically diverse suburbs like Denver, Colorado, Des Moines, Iowa, and Erie, Pennsylvania. &#xA0; Heather Conley, a senior advisor to the German Marshall Fund&#x2019;s board who led the tour, described each stop on the tour as a &#x201C;unique set of conversations and meetings&#x201D; that involve outreach to community business leaders and farming communities. The tour had previously included the Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova. But as the topic of aid to Ukraine has become increasingly politicized in the past months, she was absent from the most recent stop in Ohio. &#xA0; Republican Mike Johnson, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and a close Trump ally, openly called this autumn for Volodymyr Zelensky to fire Markarova after the Ukrainian president&#x2019;s recent visit to a Pennsylvania artillery ammunition factory producing weaponry for his armed forces. The state&#x2019;s Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, attended the visit, but there was no representation from the Republican Party. &#xA0; Conley said Markarova wasn&#x2019;t part of the Ohio stop due to the sensitivity of Ukraine&#x2019;s topic so close to the U.S. election. &#x201C;After Zelensky&#x2019;s visit to the U.S., (the Ukrainian Embassy) wanted to be, understandably, more cautious,&#x201D; Conley said. The German Marshall Fund&#x2019;s last stop before the election and second to last overall comprised one day of engagements in northeast Ohio. Once a swing state, Ohio has reliably voted Republican since 2016. It is also home to the Republican party&#x2019;s Ukraine-skeptical vice presidential nominee JD Vance and nearly 12 million voters, offering a ripe electorate to expand conservative support of Ukraine. Around 60,000 Ukrainians live in the state, including nearly 10,000 who have relocated since Russis&#x2019;a full-scale invasion, according to Global Cleveland. The German Marshall Fund&#x2019;s Ohio visit included a tour of a Ukrainian daycare, a roundtable with local Ukrainian and religious leaders, and a conversation with local U.S. veterans. Flanked by the Democratic-leaning city of Cleveland to its north and rural Ohio to its south, the city hall of Parma, Ohio, has raised the Ukrainian flag since the early days of the full-scale invasion. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)Home to Ohio&#x2019;s largest Ukrainian population, Parma, Ohio has continuous reminders of its support from Ukrainian flag-painted fire hydrants to street posts. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)With the largest concentration of Ukrainians in northeast Ohio, the whistlestop had no problem finding passionate defenders of Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty. However, some attendees said many voters in Parma are hesitant to support Ukraine. One Parma resident, who is known locally for being an outspoken Republican for Ukraine, said he will &#x201C;begrudgingly have to vote for Trump&#x201D; because of the economy, despite believing &#x201C;Ukraine is screwed with a Trump administration.&#x201D; The Republican voter, who like others spoke to the Kyiv Independent on the condition of anonymity for privacy concerns, said his support of Ukraine&#x2019;s independence is a conflicting issue for his vote, as he wishes a pro-Ukraine Republican like Nikki Haley, the Trump&#x2019;s former ambassador to the United Nations, was on the ticket. Trump has repeatedly claimed he would end Russia&#x2019;s war in 24 hours, without going into details about how he is planning to achieve that. Due to his consistent criticism of U.S. aid to Ukraine and friendly ties with the Kremlin, many fear that Trump&#x2019;s plan may involve forcing Ukraine to make territorial concessions and agree to a peace deal on unfair terms. Yet even some Ukrainians in Parma appear to have bought into Trump&#x2019;s message that he will end the war immediately should he be elected in November, earning the 78-year-old their vote. &#x201C;I talk to a lot of Ukrainians who support Trump and it almost feels like there is a bit of cognitive dissonance because they support Ukraine but they also support Trump,&#x201D; said Andriy Boechko, a Parma resident who moved from Lviv, western Ukraine, in the 1990s.

(Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)The 37-year-old registered independent says he&#x2019;ll vote for Harris as he believes Ukraine will be better off with her in office than Trump. &#x201C;I like to keep an open mind, but I&#x2019;m not a Trump supporter, definitely not, especially as far as Ukraine is concerned, I&#x2019;m a little worried about what&#x2019;s going to happen if he&#x2019;s elected,&#x201D; Boechko said. &#x201C;The most important issue is foreign policy, and I think Democrats have a better grasp on that.&#x201D; Like in other states across the U.S. that benefit from aid for Ukraine, the connection between the Biden Administration&#x2019;s foreign policy and local economic growth along with new jobs doesn&#x2019;t seem evident in Ohio. Of the $175 billion Congress has allocated for Kyiv since 2022, nearly $70 billion was poured into American manufacturing in over 70 U.S. cities, according to one analysis. Over $700 million of that sum was spent on the manufacturing economy of Ohio. Dozens of Stryker combat vehicles and M1 Abrams tanks have rolled off an Army-owned General Dynamics production line in Lima, Ohio before being sent to Kyiv. Ukraine has also received Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS) produced by General Dynamics in Springboro, Ohio. Despite that, Lima&#x2019;s Republican representative, Jim Jordan, like Trump&#x2019;s running mate Vance, opposes aid to Ukraine. According to Boechko, the Biden Administration could expand voters&#x2019; support of Ukraine if they better communicated that not all of the money the U.S. spends on aiding Ukraine goes directly to Ukraine. Parma&#x2019;s Democratic Mayor, Tim DeGeeter, argued that the middle of the country doesn&#x2019;t trust Washington during an election season. DeGeeter, who boasts a Ukrainian flag outside city hall, asked Conley of the German Marshall Fund to help get the message out to Ohioans that supporting Ukraine is an American boon. &#x201C;Even though that war is 5,000 plus miles away, it&apos;s very close to all for us here in Parma,&#x201D; DeGeeter said.

(Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)The German Marshall Fund observed a similar lack of understanding of how aid for Ukraine benefits American communities during one of their previous stops in Erie, Pennsylvania. Erie is home to Vorex LLC and Logistics Plus, which have been expanding the local manufacturing economy by providing Ukraine with bulletproof vests and generators, respectively. According to Conley, Erie&apos;s businesses are &#x201C;critical players in America&apos;s support for Ukraine.&#x201D; The fund&#x2019;s events in Erie in May mostly attracted voters who already supported Ukraine, according to attendee Ashley Lawson, who has helped settle hundreds of Ukrainians in northwest Pennsylvania as a field director with the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants. &#x201C;Erie is a perfect example of a city that is critical to U.S. foreign and security policy every day &#x2014; they just might not realize it,&#x201D; Conley said. Meanwhile, in Ohio, Parma Mayor DeGeeter remains hopeful the large Ukrainian population will turn out in opposition to the Republican party, which has dominated most Ohio counties excluding those home to major metropolitan areas. &#xA0; &#x201C;The alternative (to a Harris White House), candidate Trump, is basically saying &#x2018;give up land and territory, that&#x2019;s how we can end this war,&#x2019;&#x201D; DeGeeter said. &#x201C;Well, that&#x2019;s kind of the goal of Putin, that&#x2019;s not a shared objective.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/in-ohio-final-push-to-increase-us-support-of-ukraine-proves-difficult-as-election-nears/	2024-10-26T08:07:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173511741.jpg
Polling station closed in southern Georgia during election following reported ballot stuffing	Georgia&apos;s Central Election Commisssion closed a polling station on Oct. 26 in the southern city of Marneuli after video footage of ballot stuffing during the parliamentary election surfaced. The Interior Ministry has also launched an investigation into the incident, Georgia media outlet SOVA reported. The investigation has been launched under Article 164 of Georgia&apos;s criminal code, concerning the &quot;falsification of elections, which provides for the deliberate falsification of election documents: voter lists, protocols, ballots, registration logs and control sheets and is punishable by up to two years of imprisonment.&quot; Nino Lomjaria, a Georgian lawyer and former ombudswoman, reported earlier on Oct. 26 that an election observer was attacked while filming a ballot box being stuffed. Giorgi Kalandarishvili, chairperson of Georgia&apos;s Central Election Committe, called the video &quot;disturbing,&quot; and said that &quot;if confirmed, the election administration will not allow such managed or manipulative incidents to undermine the many months of effort we have put into election day.&quot; Parliamentary elections in Georgia are underway on Oct. 26 which will determine if the Moscow-friendly Georgian Dream party will remain in power. Concerns about Georgia&apos;s democracy have reached a fever pitch after the ruling Georgian Dream party passed the foreign agents law, which requires organizations that receive foreign funding to be labeled as &quot;foreign agents&quot; and mirrors repressive Russian legislation used to crack down on Kremlin regime critics. On Sept. 14, the de facto leader of the ruling Georgian Dream party, oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, as part of his party&apos;s larger trend of rapprochement with Russia declared that Georgia should &quot;apologize&quot; for Russia&apos;s 2008 war against the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/polling-station-closed-in-southern-georgia-during-election-following-reported-ballot-stuffing/	2024-10-26T06:33:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2151494694.jpg
Government says 'strategically important' employees will be able to extend military exemption status	Employees in &quot;strategically important sectors of the economy&quot; will be able to extend their exemption from military conscription, Ukraine&apos;s Cabinet of Ministers announced on Oct. 26. Meanwhile, an audit of the exemption process is ongoing until Nov. 15 to assess which businesses qualify for critical enterprise status, reflecting the government&apos;s effort to balance the country&apos;s defense needs with economic stability. &quot;The reason for the audit is the abnormal increase in the number of critical enterprises and the number of reserved employees. This is done in the interest of strengthening the country&apos;s defense capability and preventing abuses,&quot; the Cabinet of Ministers said. Nearly one million people were eligible for exemption in mid-August, according to the Defense Ministry. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said in early April that he ordered relevant ministries to introduce &quot;updated, more fair&quot; rules on exempting employees of &quot;critically important&quot; companies from military service. Ukraine has been struggling to mobilize enough soldiers for the front line to compensate for troop casualties and the need to rotate soldiers who have been fighting since the onset of the full-scale war. Ukraine&apos;s parliament adopted an updated mobilization law in mid-April in order to ramp up mobilization amid Russia&apos;s ongoing war. Leading up to the passing of the law, Ukraine launched Reserv+, which the government promoted as a convenient alternative to lengthy waits at enlistment offices. Another law, signed by President Volodymyr Zelensky just before the mobilization law was passed, lowered the minimum age of compulsory military service from 27 to 25. In late 2023, Zelensky said that the military, then under General Valery Zaluzhnyi&apos;s command, requested drafting 450,000-500,000 people in the face of a prolonged war. Zaluzhyni later denied this figure.	https://kyivindependent.com/government-says-strategically-important-employees-will-be-able-to-extend-military-exemption-status/	2024-10-26T06:08:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/army-1.jpg
Georgians head out to vote in parliamentary elections, tensions run high at some polling stations	Parliamentary elections in Georgia are underway on Oct. 26 which will determine if the Moscow-friendly Georgian Dream party will remain in power. A large rally with tens of thousands of Georgians in support of the country&apos;s accession to the European Union was held in Tbilisi&apos;s Freedom Square on Oct. 20 ahead of the vote. Georgia received EU candidate status alongside Ukraine in December 2023, but questions surrounding Georgia&apos;s candidacy continue to swirl as the ruling Georgian Dream party continues to rekindle relations with Russia. Tensions are reportedly running high at some polling stations in the country. Nino Lomjaria, a lawyer and former ombudswoman, reported on Oct. 26 that an election observer was attacked while filming a ballot box being stuffed. Giorgi Kalandarishvili, chairperson of Georgia&apos;s Central Election Committe, called the video &quot;disturbing,&quot; and said that &quot;if confirmed, the election administration will not allow such managed or manipulative incidents to undermine the many months of effort we have put into election day,&quot; Georgian public media reported. Concerns about Georgia&apos;s democracy have reached a fever pitch after the ruling Georgian Dream party passed the foreign agents law, which requires organizations that receive foreign funding to be labeled as &quot;foreign agents&quot; and mirrors repressive Russian legislation used to crack down on Kremlin regime critics. On Sept. 14, the de facto leader of the ruling Georgian Dream party, oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, as part of his party&apos;s larger trend of rapprochement with Russia declared that Georgia should &quot;apologize&quot; for Russia&apos;s 2008 war against the country. Western officials have sanctioned in recent months Georgian officials who they deem as having a role in committing human rights abuses. Moscow formally initiated processes cozying relations with Tbilisi on Oct. 10 as Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a presidential decree expanding visa-free entry for Georgian citizens who are working or studying in Russia. Fears of Russian interference also ran high during the recent Moldovan election, with the vote for the EU referendum winning by only 11,000 votes despite polls showing clear support for closer ties to Europe. Moldovan authorities revealed that they had evidence of other 130,000 people receiving bribes from Russian-linked forces to influence the referendum vote. The second round of voting, which will see if President Maia Sandu will hold onto the presidency, is set to take place on Nov. 3.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgians-head-out-to-vote-in-parliamentary-elections-tensions-run-high-at-some-polling-stations/	2024-10-26T05:05:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2147848892.jpg
Media: US-sanctioned Gazprombank may buy Auchan chains in Russia	Gazprombank, one of Russia&apos;s largest banks that is also under heavy U.S. sanctions, is reportedly poised to acquire the Russian operations of the Auchan retail chain, according to sources cited by Le Monde on Oct. 25. Auchan, a French hypermarket chain, remains one of the last Western businesses operating in Russia after many companies exited the market following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. At the start of the full-scale invasion, Russia reportedly accounted for 10% of Auchan&apos;s global sales. Auchan CEO Yves Claude noted that 30,000 people, including 40% of employees and shareholders, could lose their jobs if the company exited the market. In March 2022, Auchan CEO Yves Claude told the outlet Journal du Dimanche that the company would not leave Russia despite accusations of financing the war, citing the need to keep employees and continue &quot;feeding the populations of both Ukraine and Russia.&quot; Yet, French media reported on Oct. 24 that Auchan was in the final negotiations to sell its Russian subsidiary to a local buyer and is expected to finalize the sale in the coming weeks. The potential buyer was not named in the previous reporting, only that Auchan was reportedly eager to sell as Russia&apos;s &quot;exit tax&quot; has increased from 10% to 15%, with the potential to reach 35%. As Le Monde noted, Gazprombank purchased the Mega shopping center chain from Ikea, which included 14 locations &#xA0;across Russian, and housed Auchan stores. Gazprombank has been under U.S. sanctions since 2014, with additional sanctions announced by the U.S. and U.K. in 2022 following the onset of the full-scale war. In January 2023, Russian state-controlled media announced that U.S. banks stopped dollar transfers for Gazprombank.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-gazprombank-may-buy-auchan-chains-in-russia/	2024-10-26T01:46:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1239550139.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 687,600 troops since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 687,600 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 26. This number includes 1,690 casualties Russian forces suffered over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,109 tanks, 18,332 armored fighting vehicles, 27,460 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,782 artillery systems, 1,240 multiple launch rocket systems, 984 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 17,726 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-687-600-troops-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-26T00:23:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1958294777.jpg
G7 to provide Ukraine $50 billion in loans backed by frozen Russian assets	The Group of Seven (G7) has reached an agreement to provide Ukraine with approximately $50 billion in loans backed by the revenue from foreign Russian assets, the G7 announced on Oct. 25. &quot;Our aim is to begin disbursing the funds by the end of the year,&quot; a statement from the G7 leaders read. During the G7 summit in Italy in June, G7 leaders publicly confirmed an agreement on the plan to provide Ukraine with a $50 billion loan. Officials said shortly thereafter that the plan would be finalized in October. &quot;Today, we, the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), have reached a consensus on how to deliver approximately $50 billion in Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) loans to Ukraine,&quot; the Oct. 25 statement reads. &quot;These loans will be serviced and repaid by future flows of extraordinary revenues stemming from the immobilization of Russian Sovereign Assets, in line with G7 respective legal systems and international law. &quot; The funds will support Ukraine&apos;s economic, defense, and reconstruction needs. While Western countries have frozen $300 billion in Russian assets, they can only access the annual income generated by these funds, approximately $3.2 billion. These profits will back the $50-billion loan to Kyiv, while the vast majority of the assets are frozen in European countries. Speaking at the G7 summit in June, President Volodymyr Zelensky called on G7 leaders to back the $50-billion plan but also urged the creation of a mechanism for the full confiscation of $300 billion in frozen Russian funds. According to media reports on Oct. 22, the G7 plans to keep the Russian assets immobilized even after the war against Ukraine ends.	https://kyivindependent.com/g7-to-provide-ukraine-50-billion-in-loans-backed-by-frozen-russian-assets/	2024-10-25T19:08:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2156753132.jpg
Satellite images show expansion at Soviet-era bioweapons lab in Russia	Satellite imagery shows signs of a major renovation and expansion at a restricted military facility near Moscow that once housed a Cold War biological weapons program, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Oct. 25. Sergiyev Posad-6, a military site northeast of Moscow, was a Soviet biological weapons research center during the Cold War. The Soviet military used the lab to experiment with weaponizing the viruses that cause smallpox and Ebola, among others. Shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, satellite imagery indicated massive construction and renovation at the Sergiyev Posad-6 site, the WP reported, citing photos from imaging firms Planet Labs and Maxar. The expansion amounts to over 250,000 square feet and 10 new buildings. According to experts in biodefense, the military, and satellite imaging who spoke to the WP, the facilities harbor some of the distinctive features of high-security biological labs that handle dangerous pathogens. Among these features are extensive rooftop air handling units, underground infrastructure, heightened security, and a possible power plant. The layout is &quot;consistent with lab design&quot; and suggests &quot;maximum containment&quot; labs, one expert said. &quot;The upgrades are consistent with this secure, top-secret military biological facility&apos;s historic role in developing viral biological weapons,&quot; said Andrew Weber, a former Pentagon official and senior fellow at the Council on Strategic Risks. Russian officials have said that the purpose of the labs is to study Ebola viruses and other deadly microbes in order to protect Russia from possible bioterrorism. The expansion at Sergiyev Posad-6 coincides with a Russian disinformation campaign in the early months of the full-scale invasion, when the Kremlin falsely accused Ukraine of developing biological weapons. Officials told the WP that it is impossible to tell from the satellite photos whether Russia plans to use the Sergiyev Posad-6 labs to research and develop biological weapons. Biological warfare is banned under international law. While there is no evidence Russia has used such weapons in its war against Ukraine, Kyiv has accused Moscow of launching thousands of chemical weapons attacks during its ongoing invasion. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also repeatedly resorted to nuclear blackmail to deter Ukraine&apos;s Western allies from a more aggressive response.	https://kyivindependent.com/satellite-images-show-expansion-at-soviet-era-bioweapons-lab-in-russia/	2024-10-25T18:31:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-695215514.jpg
US reports North Korean troops moving to Russia’s Kursk region	The Biden administration believes that a contingent of North Korean troops is en route to Russia&#x2019;s Kursk region to assist Moscow in countering a Ukrainian offensive launched there in August, according to a U.S. official. Although U.S. officials have not confirmed South Korean reports that North Korean soldiers will engage in direct combat, they estimate the North Korean force could number in the thousands and may rapidly be assigned to combat roles, the Wall Street Journal reports. The U.S. official&#x2019;s remarks followed National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby&#x2019;s statement earlier on Oct. 25, where he noted that some North Korean troops stationed at multiple training sites in eastern Russia will likely be deployed to Kursk, though the specific purpose remains unclear. &quot;...At least some of these North Korean troops could be deployed to the Kursk area,&quot; Kirby said. &quot;But in what capacity, for what purpose, that still remains unclear.&quot; This marks the first public acknowledgment by the U.S. of its assessment that North Korean troops could soon be in Kursk, coming a day after Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence reported that the initial units trained in Russia had already moved to the region. Initially, U.S. officials estimated around 3,000 North Korean troops were training in Russia, but Kirby indicated that the overall count could now be higher. South Korean intelligence has informed lawmakers that North Korean troop numbers in Russia could reach 10,000 by December.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-reports-north-korean-troops-moving-to-russias-kursk-region/	2024-10-25T16:58:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157772464.jpg
Russian missile attack kills 3, injures 14 in Dnipro	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A Russian missile attack struck several residential buildings and a medical facility in the central-eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro late on Oct. 25, killing three people and injuring at least 14, according to regional governor Serhii Lysak. Lysak reported that the attack left four children injured, including an eight-year-old girl and a teenage boy. One child is in critical condition. First responders have been dispatched to the site of the attack as some people might be trapped under the rubble, according to Lysak. Local news sources indicated that several strikes targeted different areas across the city. No other details were provided at the moment. Dnipro, Ukraine&apos;s fourth-largest city with a pre-war population of about one million, has served as a key logistics and humanitarian hub during the full-scale war. It is located approximately 395 kilometers (245 miles) from Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-kills-3-injures-13-in-dnipro/	2024-10-25T15:40:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-25-16_36_53.jpeg
North Korea says any troop deployment to Russia is in 'regulations of international law'	North Korea&#x2019;s foreign ministry said on Oct. 25 that any decision to send its troops to support Russia in the war in Ukraine would comply with international law, however, it did not confirm whether such a deployment had occurred. Vice Foreign Minister Kim Jong Gyu, in a statement shared by state news agency KCNA, remarked that if North Korea had taken such actions, they would align with international norms despite attempts by others to portray them as illegal. Russian President Vladimir Putin refrained from denying the reports, which have circulated from sources in Ukraine, South Korea, the United States, and other nations. Kyiv stresses that any North Korean involvement in Russia&apos;s war could amount to a crime of aggression under international law. Kim Jong Gyu noted that the foreign ministry does not oversee military matters, leaving such issues to the defense ministry and, therefore, refraining from specific comments on deployment. &quot;If there is such a thing that the world media is talking about, I think it will be an act conforming with the regulations of international law,&quot; he added. North Korea and Russia have strengthened ties since the war began, including signing a new mutual defense pact. Ukraine and Western governments have previously accused North Korea of providing weapons to Russia&#x2014;allegations both Pyongyang and Moscow have denied. President Volodymyr Zelensky, referencing intelligence reports, said that Russia intends to deploy North Korean troops to the battlefield in the coming days. Ukrainian military intelligence reported on Oct. 24 that approximately 12,000 North Korean troops, including 500 officers and three generals, were already in Russia and undergoing training at five military bases. The United States has also indicated seeing evidence of North Korean troops in Russia, while South Korean lawmakers estimate around 3,000 soldiers have already been sent, with more expected.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-says-any-troop-deployment-to-russia-is-in-regulations-of-international-law/	2024-10-25T14:05:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179013028.jpg
Usyk appeals to Trump to help free Azovstal defenders from Russian captivity	Ukrainian world boxing champion Oleksandr Usyk called on Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Oct. 25 to influence Russian President Vladimir Putin to release the defenders of the Azovstal steel plant. The POWs, made up of the Azov regiment among soldiers from other units, became a symbol of Ukraine&apos;s resistance through their tenacious defense of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol in the first three months of the all-out war. Russian forces eventually took Mariupol in May 2022, capturing the remaining defenders after Kyiv gave an order to preserve their lives. About 700 Azov fighters remain in Russian captivity, Olena Tolkachova, the head of the patronage service of the Azov Brigade, said on national television in September. Trump will be a guest on one of internet personality Joe Rogan&apos;s upcoming podcast episodes, hence, Usyk asked the American podcaster to pass on his appeal to the former U.S. president and Republican presidential nominee. &quot;If Mr. President is so confident in his influence over Putin, could he help free Azovstal defenders and all Ukrainians from Russian captivity right away? Time is of the essence,&quot; Usyk wrote on X. Earlier, Trump said that during his presidency, he &quot;(got) along very well with Putin,&quot; implying that the Russian leader often talked about his ambition to control Ukraine. The comments came two weeks before the U.S. presidential election, which is expected to decisively shape Washington&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s struggle against Russian aggression. Trump has often claimed he would end Russia&apos;s war within &quot;24 hours&quot; without elaborating on how he plans to achieve it. Some reports and statements from Trump&apos;s inner circle indicate this might entail pressuring Ukraine to cede territory or give up on its NATO aspirations.	https://kyivindependent.com/usyk-appeals-to-trump-to-help-free-azovstal-defenders-from-russian-captivity/	2024-10-25T12:05:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2153592894.jpg
Russian drone hits multi-story residential building in Kyiv	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A Russian suicide drone hit a multi-story residential building in Kyiv&apos;s Solomianskyi district on Oct. 25, Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported. An air alert sounded in Kyiv and several other oblasts of Ukraine around 9 p.m. local time due to a mass Russian drone attack, which have been a near daily occurrence in Ukraine for over a month. Some 30 minutes later, explosions were heard in the Ukrainian capital. A fire broke out on the upper floors of a residential building due to a Russian drone strike, Klitschko said. Emergency services went to the scene of impact.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-hits-multi-story-residential-building-in-kyiv/	2024-10-25T11:45:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1489471985.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia to deploy North Korean troops to combat zone on Oct. 27-28, Kyiv says	Key developments on Oct. 25: Russia is planning to send first North Korean soldiers to combat zone on Oct. 27-28, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 25, citing intelligence reports. Speaking after a regular meeting meeting with his top military and civilian officials, Zelensky called the move an &quot;obvious step toward escalation&quot; that stands in contrast to &quot;disinformation we heard from the Kremlin in recent days.&quot; &quot;The world can clearly see what Russia really wants, and that is to continue the war. That is why we need a principled and strong reaction from the world&apos;s leaders,&quot; Zelensky said. The president called on the West to put &quot;tangible pressure&quot; on both Moscow and Pyongyang to comply with the U.N. Charter and punish escalation. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. The first soldiers to participate alongside Russian forces in the war against Ukraine have been reportedly sent to Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. Zelensky also said after the meeting that Ukraine had established a buffer zone in Kursk Oblast that prevents Russia from expanding the war to further Ukrainian territories in the east. Following multiple reports by Ukraine and South Korea, the U.S. acknowledged that North Korean troops were arriving in Russia. &quot;What exactly they are doing remains to be seen,&quot; said U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, leaving room for doubt. In return for the transfer of soldiers and arms, Russia is helping Pyongyang evade sanctions and develop its nuclear capabilities, according to HUR chief Kyrylo Budanov. Ukrainian forces have killed, injured, or captured 17,819 Russian soldiers in Kursk Oblast since the first days of Kyiv&apos;s incursion, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi claimed on Oct. 25. According to the general, a total of 6,662 Russian troops have been killed, 10,446 wounded, and 711 captured since Aug. 8. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, claiming to initially seize some 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) but recently facing mounting pressure as Russia pulls in reinforcements. Syrskyi refuted Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s claims made during the BRICS summit in Kazan on Oct. 24 that about 2,000 Ukrainian troops were cut off in Kursk Oblast. &quot;This is outright disinformation that does not reflect the real situation,&quot; Syrskyi said. &quot;Ukrainian troops continue active operations in the Kursk direction, destroying the enemy&apos;s combat potential for the third month in a row.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The reports came days after the first North Korean soldiers had been reportedly deployed alongside Russian forces on the front line in Kursk Oblast. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia was planning to send first North Korean soldiers to a combat zone on Oct. 27-28. Any peace agreement to end Russia&apos;s war with Ukraine must be in Moscow&apos;s favor, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview with state media on Oct. 25. Ahead of Ukraine&apos;s first peace summit in June, Putin had outlined conditions for negotiations, which included Kyiv&apos;s surrender of the four oblasts illegally claimed by Moscow in September 2022. Russia has since said it will not engage in talks as long as Ukrainian forces remain in Kursk Oblast. &quot;Any outcome must be in Russia&apos;s favor, I say directly, without any embarrassment, and must be based on the realities on the battlefield. And without any doubt, we are not going to make any concessions here; there will be no swaps,&quot; Putin said. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia held talks in Istanbul in March 2022, but the negotiations were eventually abandoned after Ukrainian retook the north of the country and mass war crimes were discovered in the liberated areas. In comments to Ukraine&apos;s Peace Summit in June this year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the Istanbul talks failed because of the Russian side&apos;s &quot;ultimatums.&quot; Moscow was not invited to the June summit in Switzerland, attended by over 90 countries, dismissing the discussions as irrelevant without its involvement. Following the event, Zelensky expressed hope for a follow-up meeting by the end of the year, with the goal of including Russia. Yet, Moscow announced it would not participate in any future iterations of the Swiss-hosted peace summit, labeling the process a &quot;fraud.&quot; Polish President Andrzej Duda denied the possibility of transferring to Kyiv weapons systems Warsaw purchased from South Korea, Polish media RMF24 reported on Oct. 25. South Korean law prohibits the exporting of weapons to active conflict zones, but Seoul has repeatedly hinted that this could change in light of deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. Duda said he had talked to Kyiv about the possible transfer of South Korean weapons but that his response to the allies was &quot;unequivocal.&quot; &quot;There is no scenario in which we hand over weapons that we have recently bought for billions of zlotys from the pockets of our taxpayers. These weapons must serve the security and defense of the Republic of Poland,&quot; Duda said during his visit to South Korea. If Seoul agrees to supply Ukraine with weapons, it will not be from the stockpile intended for Poland, Duda added. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. The first soldiers to participate alongside Russian forces in the war against Ukraine have been reportedly sent to Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 25 that Russia is planning to send the first North Korean soldiers to the combat zone on Oct. 27-28. In return for the transfer of soldiers and arms, Russia is helping Pyongyang evade sanctions and develop its nuclear capabilities, according to HUR chief Kyrylo Budanov. Ukrainian forces destroyed radar guidance equipment of a Buk-M2 air defense system and struck a Buk-M3 system overnight on Oct. 25 in the occupied part of Luhansk Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said. The attack was carried out by Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces and other military units. The General Staff did not elaborate on other possible damage apart from the destroyed guidance system. The Russian targets were hit &quot;several dozens of kilometers behind the front line,&quot; the statement read. Buk is a family of self-propelled, medium-range air defense systems developed in the 1970s in the Soviet Union. The Buk-M2 and M3 are modernized variants, capable of shooting down aerial targets like tactical ballistic missiles at a range of 50 and 65 kilometers, respectively (30 and 40 miles). Russian proxy forces used a Buk missile to shoot down the MH17 Malaysian airliner over Donetsk Oblast on July 17, 2014, in the early months of the Donbas War. Ukraine previously destroyed a Buk-M3 system overnight on Oct. 21, the military said. Ukrainian forces have destroyed 982 Russian anti-aircraft systems throughout the full-scale war, the General Staff said in its regular morning report on Oct. 25.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-to-deploy-north-korean-troops-to-combat-zone-on-oct-27-28-kyiv-says/	2024-10-25T11:28:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1154567149.jpg
Russian troop losses for October could hit 40,000, Estonian intelligence suggests	Russian troop casualties over October may reach around 40,000 troops, Janek Kesselmann, the deputy commander of the Estonian Military Intelligence Center, said on Oct. 25. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Oct. 25 that Russian forces had suffered 1,630 casualties over the past day, surpassing the previous second-highest tally of 1,530, which was set on Oct. 18. &quot;Russia&apos;s losses are quite high. And this month seems to be one of the biggest in terms of losses for Russia,&quot; Kesselmann told Estonian media EER. Russian troops continue to advance along the entire front line, made possible by constant shelling and so-called human wave infantry attacks, Kesselmann added. Russian attacks are currently most concentrated around Zelene and Kurakhove in the Pokrovsk sector of Donetsk Oblast. Meanwhile, Russian tactics have shifted recently to not entering the settlements, as this requires more &quot;sophisticated&quot; preparation, according to Estonian intelligence. &quot;Therefore, they besiege settlements with indirect fire. After the settlement is surrounded, they simply destroy it. It is a very cynical and disgusting thing,&quot; Kesselmann said. Russian troops have also advanced in the area of Chasiv Yar and the Lyman sector of the front line in Donetsk Oblast. In Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, there were no significant changes in the territories controlled by Ukrainian troops over the past week, Estonian intelligence said. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. The first soldiers to participate alongside Russian forces in the war against Ukraine have been reportedly sent to Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. The first Noth Korean soldiers are to be deployed to the combat zone on Oct. 27-28, according to Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-may-lose-nearly-40-000-personnel-in-war-with-ukraine-in-october-estonian-intelligence-suggests/	2024-10-25T11:09:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1241864963-16583266909s1o2.jpg
Translator planned to be assigned to every 30 North Korean soldiers, Ukraine's military intelligence says	Russia plans to assign one interpreter to every 30 North Korean soldiers for better coordination with Russian troops on the battlefield, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency reported on Oct. 25, citing an intercepted conversation between service members of a Russian brigade in Kursk Oblast. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, to participate in the war against Ukraine, according to military intelligence. The first sightings of North Korean soldiers on a base in Russia were recorded on Oct. 23. Moscow is planning to send the first North Korean soldiers to a combat zone on Oct. 27-28, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. In the intercepted conversations, the Russian military refers to the North Korean soldiers as &quot;K Battalion,&quot; according to HUR. Apart from an interpreter, three Russian soldiers will be assigned to every group of 30 North Korean fighters. Yes, there are doubts in the Russian army about the possibility of carrying this out in practice. North Korea has denied reports of its troops&apos; presence in Russia, while a Kremlin spokesperson provided an evasive response. A military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 21 that Russian authorities detained 18 North Korean soldiers who abandoned their positions in Kursk Oblast. Video footage has also emerged, allegedly showing North Korean troops at a Russian military training camp. South Korean media reported on Oct. 22 that Pyongyang had dispatched pilots capable of flying Russian warplanes to join the conflict in Ukraine. South Korea&apos;s Yonhap agency also stated that South Korea is considering sending personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/translator-planned-to-be-assigned-to-every-30-north-korean-soldiers-ukraines-military-intelligence-says/	2024-10-25T09:32:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-492165484.jpg
Poland rules out transferring recently-purchased South Korean weapons to Ukraine	Polish President Andrzej Duda denied the possibility of transferring to Kyiv weapons systems Warsaw purchased from South Korea, Polish media RMF24 reported on Oct. 25. South Korean law prohibits the exporting of weapons to active conflict zones, but Seoul has repeatedly hinted that this could change in light of deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. Duda said he had talked to Kyiv about the possible transfer of South Korean weapons but that his response to the allies was &quot;unequivocal.&quot; &quot;There is no scenario in which we hand over weapons that we have recently bought for billions of zlotys from the pockets of our taxpayers. These weapons must serve the security and defense of the Republic of Poland,&quot; Duda said during his visit to South Korea. If Seoul agrees to supply Ukraine with weapons, it will not be from the stockpile intended for Poland, Duda added. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. The first soldiers to participate alongside Russian forces in the war against Ukraine have been reportedly sent to Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 25 that Russia is planning to send the first North Korean soldiers to the combat zone on Oct. 27-28. In return for the transfer of soldiers and arms, Russia is helping Pyongyang evade sanctions and develop its nuclear capabilities, according to HUR chief Kyrylo Budanov.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-refuses-to-transfer-south-korean-weapons-to-ukraine/	2024-10-25T09:03:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2160599935-1.jpg
The little-known obstacle to Ukraine's mobilization effort	As Ukraine faces challenges with replenishing its military ranks amid manpower shortage to fight against Russia&apos;s invading forces, President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s office claimed that U.S. officials were pressuring Kyiv to lower the minimum mobilization age &#x2013; which now stands at 25. But can Ukraine actually lower the mobilization age? There&#x2019;s a complication many don&#x2019;t know about.	https://kyivindependent.com/the-little-known-obstacle-to-ukraines-mobilization-effort/	2024-10-25T08:20:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/mobilization--2---1-.jpg
Russia 'not planning any concessions,' Putin says on peace talks with Ukraine	Any peace agreement to end Russia&apos;s war with Ukraine must be in Moscow&apos;s favor, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview with state media on Oct. 25. Ahead of Ukraine&apos;s first peace summit in June, Putin had outlined conditions for negotiations, which included Kyiv&apos;s surrender of the four oblasts illegally claimed by Moscow in September 2022. Russia has since said it will not engage in talks as long as Ukrainian forces remain in Kursk Oblast. &quot;Any outcome must be in Russia&apos;s favor, I say directly, without any embarrassment, and must be based on the realities on the battlefield. And without any doubt, we are not going to make any concessions here; there will be no swaps,&quot; Putin said. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia held talks in Istanbul in March 2022, but the negotiations were eventually abandoned after Ukrainian retook the north of the country and mass war crimes were discovered in the liberated areas. In comments to Ukraine&apos;s Peace Summit in June this year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the Istanbul talks failed because of the Russian side&apos;s &quot;ultimatums.&quot; Moscow was not invited to the June summit in Switzerland, attended by over 90 countries, dismissing the discussions as irrelevant without its involvement. Following the event, Zelensky expressed hope for a follow-up meeting by the end of the year, with the goal of including Russia. Yet, Moscow announced it would not participate in any future iterations of the Swiss-hosted peace summit, labeling the process a &quot;fraud.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/were-not-planning-any-concessions-putin-says-on-peace-talks-with-ukraine/	2024-10-25T08:08:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173543365.jpg
Rheinmetall provides Ukraine with 20 Marder infantry fighting vehicles	German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall sent 20 Marder infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine at the end of the third quarter of 2024, the company announced on Oct. 25. Rheinmetall has so far transferred about 200 combat vehicles, including over a hundred Marder 1A3 models, to Ukraine directly or indirectly through the so-called circular exchange program. The German manufacturer first received an order for the Marder infantry fighting vehicles in March 2023. The recent batch of 20 Marder infantry fighting vehicles provided to Ukraine was ordered by the German government and financed in the &quot;mid-double-digit million euros,&quot; according to the statement. Rheinmetall&apos;s Marder 1A3, which Ukraine is receiving, is equipped with additional laser rangefinders for efficient and precise target engagement. The agreement also provides for the delivery of a double-digit number of other pieces of equipment, including Marder infantry fighting vehicles and Leopard tanks, Rheinmetall said. In late July, Rheinmetall announced that it had received an order from the Ukrainian government to begin the construction of an ammunition factory in Ukraine. The company previously said it planned to open at least four production plants in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/rheinmetall-provides-ukraine-with-20-marder-infantry-fighting-vehicles/	2024-10-25T07:16:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/marder.jpg
Zelensky rejects UN secretary-general's visit over Russia trip, presidential source tells AFP	President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres&apos;s visit to Ukraine due to his participation in a summit in Russia, AFP reported on Oct. 25, citing an unnamed high-ranking source close to the Presidential Office. The Kyiv Independent reached out for comment to the Presidential Office but has not received an answer at the time of publication. Guterres attended the BRICS summit hosted in Kazan on Oct. 23-24, despite Ukraine&apos;s criticism. The U.N. secretary-general did not visit the global peace summit in Switzerland at Kyiv&apos;s invitation in the summer. &quot;After Kazan, (Guterres) wanted to come to Ukraine, but the president did not confirm his visit. So Guterres won&apos;t be here, specifically because of the humiliation of sanity and international law in Kazan,&quot; the source told AFP. In Kazan, Guterres met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The photo of their handshake was blasted by Ukrainians and some Western officials on social media. The U.N. secretary&apos;s visit came as North Korean troops are reportedly being deployed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast and are expected to be sent to fight in Ukraine. Guterres reiterated to Putin that Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine violated the U.N. charter and international law, according to a U.N. statement issued after their meeting. &quot;Although even some of its functionaries prefer the temptations in Kazan to the content of the U.N. Charter, our world is built in such a way that the rights of nations and the norms of international law matter and will matter,&quot; Zelensky said on Oct. 24, without naming Guterres. Guterres&apos;s visit to Ukraine was not previously announced. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, among other leaders, also arrived at the summit. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has canceled the trip after suffering a head injury at home.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-reportedly-rejects-un-secretarys-visit-to-ukraine-due-to-his-kazan-summit-participation/	2024-10-25T06:58:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179912953-1.jpg
For 2nd time in October, Russia suffers 2nd deadliest day since start of full-scale invasion, Ukraine claims	For the second time this month, Russian forces have suffered their second deadliest day since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to figures released by Kyiv. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces on Oct. 25 reported 1,630 Russian casualties over the past day, surpassing the previous second-highest tally of 1,530, which was set just last week. The bloodiest day for Moscow&apos;s forces was on May 13, when they suffered a reported 1,740 casualties. The figures, which the Kyiv Independent could not independently verify, &#xA0;do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. Facing a shortage of manpower and a pressing need to maintain the grinding advances in eastern Ukraine, Russia has reportedly been throwing some of its most skilled troops into mass infantry attacks, and at very high costs. &quot;The past four months have proved the costliest for Russian forces since the war began in 2022,&quot; according to a U.K. military intelligence report on Sept. 23. According to some experts, the surge in losses in recent months may be one of the factors behind the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia. &quot;The disclosure that North Korean troops may appear on the front line is a direct consequence of catastrophic Russian casualties,&quot; John Foreman CBE, the U.K.&apos;s former defense attache in Moscow from 2019 to 2022, told the Kyiv Independent last week. &quot;Their military effectiveness is questionable and they will be cannon fodder for Ukrainian defenders.&quot; The Netherlands, on Oct. 25, became the latest country to confirm the deployment of North Korean troops, claiming at least 1,500 are to be stationed in Kursk Oblast where Ukraine still holds sizable territory after an incursion launched in August. &quot;We expect the troops will mainly be deployed in Kursk and consist of mainly special units from the North Korean army,&quot; Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said in comments reported by Reuters. He added that Russia is likely testing the troops and gauging international reaction. The U.S. on Oct. 23 made its first public confirmation that it had evidence of Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers being sent to Russia, following previous reports from Ukraine and South Korea.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby later said they were &quot;fair game&quot; for Ukrainian forces. &quot;If they do deploy to fight against Ukraine, they&apos;re fair game, they&apos;re fair targets, and the Ukrainian military will defend themselves against North Korean soldiers the same way they&apos;re defending themselves against Russian soldiers,&quot; Kirby told a press briefing at the White House. &quot;And so the possibility that there could be dead and wounded North Korean soldiers&#x2026; is absolutely real if they get deployed.&quot; Kirby also revealed details of U.S. intelligence assessments, saying Washington believes North Korea &quot;moved at least 3000 soldiers into eastern Russia.&quot; &quot;We assess that these soldiers traveled by ship from the Wan area in North Korea to Vladivostok, Russia,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;These soldiers then traveled onward to multiple Russian military training sites in eastern Russia where they are currently undergoing training.&quot; Kirby said it was too early to say for sure if they &quot;will enter into combat alongside the Russian military,&quot; but added it was a &quot;highly concerning probability.&quot; In comments to Russian state TV on Oct. 25, Russian President Vladimir Putin said using North Korea&apos;s troops in its war in Ukraine was &quot;our business,&quot; and that if Kyiv wanted to join NATO then Moscow would do what it had to ensure its security. &quot;The sooner they realize the futility of such an approach in relations with Russia, the better it will be for everyone, and perhaps, above all, for themselves,&quot; he said. &quot;When we have to decide something, we will decide... but it is our sovereign decision whether we will apply it, whether we will not, whether we need it,&quot; he added in reference to the deployment of North Korean troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/for-2nd-time-in-october-russia-suffers-2nd-deadliest-day-since-start-of-full-scale-invasion-ukraine-claims/	2024-10-25T05:57:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1958294777.jpg
Our business' if we deploy North Korean troops, Putin says	Any possible deployment of North Korean troops to aid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine would be a &quot;sovereign decision&quot; by Moscow and Pyongyang, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview with state media on Oct. 25. Speaking to Russian propagandist Olga Skabeyeva, Putin did not explicitly confirm the dispatch of North Korean soldiers, saying that &quot;once it&apos;s necessary to make a decision, we will do so.&quot; When foreign journalists asked Putin about the matter at the BRICS summit on Oct. 24, he said that the Russia-North Korea defense treaty provides for such a step. Asked about satellite images provided by South Korean intelligence, allegedly showing North Korean soldiers heading to Russia, Putin replied, &quot;Images are a serious thing; if there are images, they reflect something.&quot; The comments were seen as the first indirect admission by Russia about the deployment of North Korean troops, which has already been confirmed by Ukraine, South Korea, the U.S., and others. Pyongyang has dismissed the reports as &quot;groundless rumors.&quot; Downplaying his statements at the BRICS summit, Putin nevertheless reiterated in the interview with Skabeyeva that Article 4 of the treaty enables the deployment of troops. &quot;What we will do with this article, that is still a question,&quot; the Russian president said. &quot;But I want to say that this is our sovereign decision. Whether we use it or not, where, how, or whether we engage in exercises, training, or transfer some experience. It&apos;s our business.&quot; North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. The first Noth Korean soldiers are to be deployed to a combat zone on Oct. 27-28, according to Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-north-korean-troops/	2024-10-25T05:11:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157679114.jpg
Russia has suffered 17,800 casualties since start of Kursk incursion, Syrskyi claims	Ukrainian forces have killed, injured, or captured 17,819 Russian soldiers in Kursk Oblast since the first days of Kyiv&apos;s incursion, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi claimed on Oct. 25. According to the general, a total of 6,662 Russian troops have been killed, 10,446 wounded, and 711 captured since Aug. 8. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, claiming to initially seize some 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) but recently facing mounting pressure as Russia pulls in reinforcements. Syrskyi refuted Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s claims made during the BRICS summit in Kazan on Oct. 24 that about 2,000 Ukrainian troops were cut off in Kursk Oblast. &quot;This is outright disinformation that does not reflect the real situation,&quot; Syrskyi said. &quot;Ukrainian troops continue active operations in the Kursk direction, destroying the enemy&apos;s combat potential for the third month in a row.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The reports came days after the first North Korean soldiers had been reportedly deployed alongside Russian forces on the front line in Kursk Oblast. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia was planning to send first North Korean soldiers to a combat zone on Oct. 27-28.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-casualties-in-kursk/	2024-10-25T04:38:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166312696.jpg
Belarus Weekly: Lukashenko to reelect himself in January as regime prepares for elections	Belarus schedules next presidential election for January 2025. Belarus reportedly shoots down the second Russian drone amid ongoing incursions into its airspace. The EU supports Poland&#x2019;s migration plan, including suspended right to asylum amid the continued artificial migration crisis at the Belarus border. Russia&#x2019;s ambassador claims Moscow would help Minsk quash &#x2018;attempts to destabilize&#x2019; the country in the upcoming 2025 presidential elections. Belarus detains journalist Ihar Ilyash, husband of imprisoned reporter Katsiaryna Bakhvalava, who stayed in the country despite looming threat. Viasna claims 26 former political prisoners in Belarus face trials in October, with their sentences increased, reflecting a troubling trend of escalating political repression. Belarus has scheduled its next presidential election for Jan. 26, 2025, the country&#x2019;s Central Electoral Commission announced on Oct. 23. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko is widely expected to hold on to power following the election&apos;s result. Lukashenko, the country&apos;s leader since 1994 and Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s closest ally, has long been accused of staging fraudulent elections in Belarus. In 2020, during the last presidential election, Lukashenko maintained power despite the country&apos;s most prominent opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, receiving popular support &#x2014; claiming she won with 60 per cent of the vote. Following the fabricated results, mass protest erupted in Minsk but were ultimately quelled with the support of Russia. According to the Belarusian human rights group Viasna, over 50,000 citizens have been detained for political reasons since the 2020 election. When asked on Oct. 23 about Maria Kalesnikava, one of the leaders of the country&apos;s opposition movment kept in prison since Sept. 8, 2020, &#xA0;Lukashenko said she needs to ask for an official pardon. On Nov. 28, 2022, Kalesnikava was admitted to intensive care after suffering severe health issues. She has since been returned to serve her sentence in a penal colony. She is reportedly denied correspondence with her family and friends, and other inmates are prohibited from speaking with her. There have been almost no information on Kalesnikava&apos;s wellbeing since February 2023. Belarusian Air Defense Forces shot down a Russian Shahed-type drone over Yelsk in the southern region of Homiel on Oct. 20, the Belarusian Hajun war monitoring project has reported. As Russia has stepped up its drone attacks on Ukraine over the last month, incursions of Russian combat drones into the country are becoming an almost daily occurrence, with Ukraine reportedly using electronic warfare measures to send the drones off course. According to the monitoring group, at least three drones entered Belarusian airspace overnight on Oct. 20. One, entering at 12:30 a.m. local time, returned to Ukraine after flying over a narrow strip of south-eastern Belarus that reaches down almost to the Kyiv Sea reservoir in Ukraine. Another drone entered Belarus from Ukraine&#x2019;s Zhytomyr Oblast and headed toward the town of Mazyr, where there is an oil refinery. Aircraft were scrambled to intercept the drone at around 1 a.m. near the town of Yelsk, south of Mazyr in Homiel Oblast, where residents reported hearing sounds of explosions. Belarusian officials have not confirmed the downing. On that night, the Ukrainian army reported downing 31 of the 51 attack drones launched in Russia. It said two drones veered off course to Belarus. Shahed-type drone incursions into Belarus have been reported almost daily in the past week, except for Oct. 18-19, when drones were spotted in Ukraine heading for Belarus but failed to reach its territory. Fighters were repeatedly scrambled to intercept the UAVs. The latest incident is the second time Belarus has downed a drone that entered its airspace. Belarus&#x2019;s military first confirmed the downing of a drone over its territory on Sept. 5. Another drone crashed on Oct. 3 in Kalinkavichy, and a witness of the incident, a woman, was arrested. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko claimed on Oct. 4 that the Belarusian Air Force downs &#x201C;a lot of drones,&#x201D; both Russian and Ukrainian, and attributed the incursions to the work of radio-electronic warfare equipment and mistakes by drone operators. No proof of Ukrainian drones entering Belarusian airspace has ever been presented. Russian Shahed-type drones started routinely flying into Belarus in July this year. The Belarusian Hajun project reports spotting 27 UAVs in September alone. Russia&#x2019;s staunchest ally, Minsk, has never publicly raised objections to Moscow over the reported drone incidents. The European Commission has supported Poland&apos;s controversial policy of suspending the right to asylum for illegal migrants that are sent into the country by Belarus and Russia to create tensions on the European Union&#x2019;s eastern borders. &#x201C;Russia and Belarus, or any other country, cannot be allowed to abuse our values, including the right to asylum, and to undermine our democracies,&#x201D; reads a statement from the 27 EU leaders following a meeting in Brussels on Oct. 17. The statement also supports Poland&#x2019;s recent migration program, which includes temporarily suspending the right to asylum. &#x201C;Exceptional situations require appropriate measures,&#x201D; the statement reads. The Polish government on Oct. 15 approved Prime Minister Donald Tusk&#x2019;s program to tighten migration policies and suspend the right to asylum, sparking an outcry among human rights groups and criticism from political opponents and some of Tusk&#x2019;s own coalition members. Polish President Andrzej Duda, in an address to the Polish parliament, argued against the decision, saying it might impede the chances of dissidents from Belarus and Russia receiving asylum. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s put it bluntly: Putin and Lukashenko are trying to destabilize the situation on our border, in the EU, and your response to this is to deprive the people Putin and Lukashenko put in prison and persecute of safe haven,&#x201D; Duda said in response to Tusk&#x2019;s plan. &#x201C;I think this is some kind of fatal mistake.&#x201D; Tusk, however, said the measure would not affect dissidents. The EU&#x2019;s backing is a win for Tusk, who has been seeking to receive European approval for suspending asylum rights should &#x201C;a threat of the destabilization of the state through an influx of migrants&#x201D; occur. Poland has long accused Belarus and Russia of waging a &#x201C;hybrid war,&#x201D; encouraging waves of illegal migrants from Africa and the Middle East to try and cross the borders into the EU in order to put pressure on the country. Belarus denies the accusation. According to the Polish Defense Ministry, Poland stopped 26,000 illegal border crossing attempts in 2024 alone. One soldier was killed in a clash with migrants, and 63 sustained injuries. Belarus unleashed an artificial migration crisis in 2021 in response to the sanctions imposed on the Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime. Poland&#x2019;s officials link the more recent waves to the Kremlin, however, as the incoming migrants tend to have Russian visas. Russia&#x2019;s Ambassador to Belarus, Boris Gryzlov, has said Moscow will assist Minsk if there are &#x201C;attempts to destabilize the situation&#x201D; during the 2025 presidential elections in Belarus, Russian state-affiliated news outlet RIA Novosti reported on Oct. 22. &#x201C;There is no reason to believe that the Belarusian law enforcers and special services will need additional assistance, as they say, &#x2018;on the ground,&#x2019;&#x201D; Gryzlov said in an interview with RIA Novosti. &#x201C;But if necessary, Russia, within the framework of its obligations, will certainly provide (any) assistance and support that our closest ally and strategic partner asks of us.&#x201D; Gryzlov also accused &#x201C;Western states&#x201D; of planning to interfere in the domestic affairs of Belarus and Russia, and claimed that Russia and Belarus had exchanged intelligence regarding the &#x201C;potential threats.&#x201D; The Belarusian Central Election Commission on Oct. 23 announced that the next presidential elections will be held in Belarus on Jan. 26, 2025. Longtime Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has made contradicting statements regarding his plans to &#x201C;run for election.&#x201D; However, with all political parties eliminated in the country, apart from four that are loyal to the regime, and all opposition leaders jailed or exiled, no other realistic challengers to Lukashenko for the presidency are in sight. In 2020, Lukashenko claimed to have won by a landslide, sparking nationwide protests eventually crushed by the regime. The regime began to crackdown on any form of dissent, with the Viasna Human Rights organization reports at least 1,300 political prisoners are currently behind bars, and over 6,000 face charges in politically motivated criminal cases. Belarusian police have detained Ihar Ilyash, a Belarusian journalist, co-author of the book &#x201C;Belarusian Donbas,&#x201D; and the husband of another journalist already jailed for eight years on treason charges. The Belarusian Interior Ministry announced the arrest in a video posted on Oct. 22 on a pro-government channel. In the video, Ilyash confesses to &#x201C;giving interviews to various media resources, including those that have been declared to be &#x2018;extremist&#x2019; in Belarus.&#x201D; Although the official reason for the arrest was not clearly stated, the captions to the video say it is in connection with &#x201C;aiding extremist activities&#x201D; and &#x201C;gathering information for foreign intelligence services.&#x201D; Ilyash, formerly a journalist for the Polish-funded satellite TV channel Belsat, is a freelance writer and political analyst for several online news outlets. With his wife, journalist Katsiaryna Bakhvalava, he co-authored the book Belarusian Donbas, which documents Belarus&#x2019; involvement in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine since 2014. Published in Kyiv in 2020, the book was slapped with an &#x201C;extremist&#x201D; label in Belarus in March 2021. Despite apparent risks of persecution, Ilyash stayed in Belarus to be close to his arrested wife. Bakhvalava, a correspondent for Belsat, was among the first journalists jailed for livestreaming the nationwide protests in 2020. Having almost served out her initial two-year sentence, she was given an additional eight years in prison. Among the nearly 1,300 political prisoners in Belarus, there are 39 journalists and five media workers, Reporters Without Borders says. The country scored 167 out of 180 on the World Press Freedom Index 2024 and was labeled Europe&#x2019;s most dangerous country for journalists before Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

(Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images)At least 26 former Belarusian political prisoners are facing fresh trials in October that could see their sentences become harsher &#x2013; increased from house arrest to imprisonment in penal colonies &#x2013; according to the Viasna Human Rights Center. Between June and September, Viasna recorded 15 trials in which a punishment of house arrest for people convicted in politically motivated cases was replaced with imprisonment. The organization says this is a growing trend. Since the start of the ongoing crackdown on the opposition after the 2020 presidential elections, 1,507 Belarusians have been charged in politically motivated cases and placed under house arrest, a punishment that doesn&#x2019;t meet international criteria for recognizing them as political prisoners, but places them under the strict daily control of the state. House arrest includes a curfew, restricting individuals mainly to their home and workplace, with about two hours allowed for commuting. Convicts must check in at police stations weekly, and law enforcement can conduct home visits at any time of the day or night. Missing a check or returning home late can lead to harsher penalties, including prison time. Primarily, Belarusians are sentenced to house arrest for &#x201C;gross violations of public order&#x201D; or insulting Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko and other officials. While the plight of the country&#x2019;s 1,300 political prisoners has been recognized internationally, the Lukashenko regime also employs less visible forms of punishment to silence dissidents.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-lukashenko-to-reelect-himself-in-january-as-regime-prepares-for-elections/	2024-10-25T04:32:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1242954831.jpg
Dutch intelligence confirms Russia deploying North Korean troops to fight Ukraine, minister says	Dutch intelligence has confirmed that Moscow has deployed at least 1,500 North Korean troops to join the war against Ukraine, Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said on Oct. 25. The Netherlands has joined Ukraine, South Korea, and the U.S. in confirming that Pyongyang has sent military personnel to aid Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;We expect the troops will mainly be deployed in Kursk and consist of mainly special units from the North Korean army,&quot; Brekelmans said in comments reported by Reuters. According to the minister, the initial deployment should help Russia test the soldiers and the international reaction. Brekelmans called the move a &quot;clear escalation&quot; and said the West must present an &quot;appropriate response.&quot; North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. The move signals deepening cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow after North Korea also supplied Russia with artillery shells and ballistic missiles. The first soldiers to participate alongside Russian forces in the war against Ukraine have been reportedly sent to Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, the first troops will be deployed to the combat zone on Oct. 27-28. Kyiv and Seoul were raising alarms about the personnel transfer early on, but the U.S. acknowledged their presence only on Oct. 23, becoming the first Western country to do so. The U.S. should &quot;seriously consider taking direct military action against&#x2026; North Korean troops&quot; if they enter Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, U.S. Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Michael R. Turner said. Pyongyang has denied the reports, while Russian President Vladimir Putin indirectly hinted at their presence but stopped short of denying or confirming the presence of North Korean troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/dutch-intelligence-confirms-russia-deploying-north-korean-troops/	2024-10-25T04:01:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/dutch.jpg
How Russia attempted to steal Moldovan election, referendum, and what comes next?	Although Russian interference has taken many forms in Moldova since its independence in 1991, the election and referendum results on Sunday shocked many pro-European Moldovans. Despite opinion polls showing clear support for entrenching the desire for EU accession into the country&apos;s constitution, the success of the EU referendum came down to the wire, with the support of the large Moldovan diaspora securing a 50.38% victory margin. The &quot;yes&quot; vote won by a mere 11,000 votes. Moldovan authorities, the EU, and U.S. officials, as well as independent observers, blamed an unprecedented attack on the country&apos;s democracy from criminal networks and political groups tied to Russia. Two weeks before the referendum and presidential election that took place on the same day, Moldovan police and the country&apos;s anti-corruption agency announced that they had evidence that around 130,000 people were to take bribes from Russian-linked forces in an attempt to overturn the referendum&apos;s results. In a press briefing at 1AM, Moldovan President Maia Sandu said that, according to her information, those who were set to disrupt the referendum were incentivized to buy up to 300,000 votes. If true, that would represent about 20% of the 1.5 million ballots cast on Oct. 20. Altogether, the police said fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor transferred $39 million to buy votes in September and October. Shor, who still maintains some political support despite being on the run, denies any wrongdoing.

(Daniel Mihailescu / AFP via Getty Images)Journalistic investigations by Ziarul de Gard&#x103; and Zona de securitate confirmed that the scheme was conducted through Telegram groups and used the Russian state-owned bank Promsvyazbank and its branches in the country&apos;s eastern Russian-influenced breakaway region of Transnistria. &quot;Simple mathematical calculus confirm what the authorities have said: yes, there was massive electoral fraud,&quot; said Tatiana Cojocari, a sociologist from Watchdog, one of the think tanks that commissioned polls in Moldova. &quot;People who would have otherwise not cast their ballots were bought. We had a mass bribe-driven mobilization for the &apos;no&apos; vote in the referendum, just like media investigations showed,&quot; she added. Following the conclusion of the referendum, all eyes are now on the presidential election runoff, set for Nov. 3. Pro-EU President Sandu will run against the former Prosecutor General Alexandr Stoianoglo, whom she dismissed for alleged corruption. Stoianoglo scored 26% in the first round, considerably more than the 9-11% opinion polls predicted. While Stoianoglo, like Sandu, is a double Moldovan-Romanian citizen and publicly says he supports his country&apos;s EU accession, the former prosecutor is supported by the pro-Kremlin Party of Socialists. He also opposed the referendum, dismissing it as serving the interest of Sandu rather than the EU integration process. Days before the election, screenshots from Telegram groups were leaked to the press saying the vote buying network controlled by fugitive oligarch Shor, who now lives in Moscow, was asked to vote for Stoianoglo. Both Shor and Stoianoglo deny any involvement in bribery schemes. &quot;Criminal networks have shown that they are stronger on the technological front than state institutions,&quot; analyst Igor Bo&#x21B;an, from the think tank ADEPT, told Kyiv Independent. To ensure fair elections on Nov. 3 and next summer (during parliament elections), the government would need to block bank transactions from Russia and the use of cryptocurrency in Moldova, through which Russian money is channeled. &quot;If they don&apos;t have the capacity to do it, they should appeal to EU partners for support,&quot; Bo&#x21B;an said. According to analyst Victor Ciobanu, the election results showed a protest vote that should be a &quot;wake-up call&quot; for Sandu&apos;s pro-European government. Since the war in Ukraine, inflation has risen by 40% in Moldova, while salaries and pensions have not caught up. Many blame the rising prices on the government and share a frustration with the slow anti-corruption and judiciary reforms. &quot;But the government can and should be changed only as a result of normal, fair, and honest elections,&quot; Ciobanu said. &quot;What has been happening here for several years now &#x2014; in Orhei, Gagauzia, and now nationally &#x2014; cannot be called elections&quot; because of the overwhelming presence of &quot;dirty money&quot; and &quot;lies,&quot; he said. If the process of corrupting the foundations of democracy is not stopped, Ciobanu argues, in 2025, after parliamentary elections, Moldovans will end up with &quot;a captured mafia state&quot; once again. &quot;And the Kremlin will get a pro-Russian government in Moldova without a single shot (fired) and the opportunity to open a second front against Ukraine,&quot; Ciobanu added. Political scientist Ileana Racheru agrees that if Moscow controls the government, Russia could use Chisinau airport to transport military help via Istanbul or Yerevan. &quot;If the pro-Russians come to power, I don&apos;t think Russia will give them money to keep Moldova afloat, to address chronic poverty. They will need money from the EU and will delay the process (eventually), both to please Russia and to take care of their own business and corruption schemes. But we don&apos;t know if Russia would be happy with the situation,&quot; Racheru said. &quot;They could ask for help in Ukraine,&quot; she added. Bo&#x21B;an, meanwhile, said that such scenarios, where a Russia-friendly government takes over Moldova, are unpredictable and that &quot;for Ukraine, it would not be a problem to neutralize a danger coming from Moldova if they have enough resources.&quot; He is more concerned about the impact such a result would have on Moldova, including a &quot;catastrophic exodus of the young.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/how-russia-tried-to-influence-moldovan-elections-and-referendum-what-it-means-going-forward/	2024-10-25T03:11:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178799635.jpg
Kyiv receives lists of missing Ukrainian soldiers via Qatar, ombudsman says	Ukraine has received a list of missing Ukrainian soldiers thanks to mediation by Qatar, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said on Oct. 24 Lubinets made the announcement on his Telegram channel after visiting Qatar and meeting Lolwah Al-Khater, the country&apos;s Foreign Ministry senior official. The Gulf country has previously acted as a mediator between Kyiv and Moscow to bring back Ukrainian children illegally held by Russia. Lubinets did not specify in his statement whether the lists were provided to Qatar by Moscow or the status of the listed missing soldiers. Apart from the list, he received letters from Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) for their families and discussed the possibility of speeding up the process of POW exchanges between Kyiv and Moscow. The parties also agreed to provide assistance to civilians in difficult life situations, including in restoring personal documents, Lubinets said. According to the Interior Ministry, Ukraine records 55,000 citizens in its register of persons missing under special circumstances as of late September. The register includes people who have disappeared due to war, occupation, or natural and man-made disasters.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-receives-list-of-missing-ukrainian-soldiers-via-qatar-ombudsman-says/	2024-10-25T03:00:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2030921955.jpg
Russia to deploy North Korean troops to combat zone on Oct. 27-28, Zelensky says	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. Russia is planning to send first North Korean soldiers to a combat zone on Oct. 27-28, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 25, citing intelligence reports. Speaking after a meeting with the Headquarters of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, Zelensky called it an &quot;obvious step toward escalation&quot; that stands in contrast to &quot;disinformation we heard from the Kremlin in recent days.&quot; &quot;The world can clearly see what Russia really wants, and that is to continue the war. That is why we need a principled and strong reaction from the world&apos;s leaders,&quot; Zelensky said. He called on the West to put &quot;tangible pressure&quot; on both Moscow and Pyongyang to comply with the U.N. Charter and punish escalation. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. The first soldiers to participate alongside Russian forces in the war against Ukraine have been reportedly deployed to the front line in embattled Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-to-deploy-north-korean-troops-to-combat-zone-on-oct-27-28-zelensky-says/	2024-10-25T02:44:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029588238--1-.jpg
We can't have a bad outcome,' JP Morgan Chase CEO says on Ukraine, Russia's nuclear threats	&quot;We can&apos;t have a bad outcome&quot; in Ukraine, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said at an Institute for International Finance (IIF) event on Oct. 24 when discussing Russia&apos;s full-scale war and its nuclear threats. &quot;Nuclear proliferation is the biggest risk mankind faces,&quot; said Dimon, head of the largest U.S. bank and the world&apos;s largest investment bank by revenue. According to him, the West has to have clarity and subordinate many things &quot;to make sure that this ends up right.&quot; Dimon has described himself as a supporter of Ukraine, and JPMorgan Chase has been involved in Ukraine&apos;s recovery efforts. Along with another U.S. investment firm, BlackRock, the company agreed to set up a $15 billion fund for Ukraine. &quot;A lot of other nations that border Russia, they&apos;re quite worried. And some of (those who) don&apos;t border Russia are quite worried,&quot; he said. &quot;And we have never had a situation where a man is threatening nuclear blackmail, &apos;if your military starts to win, we are rolling out the nuclear weapons&apos; type of thing.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly made nuclear threats against Ukraine and the West since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The threats have failed to materialize, and Moscow continues to wage its all-out war without using its nuclear arsenal. &quot;I think we should be very careful about what we are trying to accomplish in the next couple of years,&quot; Dimon said, voicing a belief that nuclear proliferation is an even greater challenge to humanity than climate change. Putin proposed a series of changes to Russia&apos;s nuclear doctrine in late September. This coincided with the peak of discussions between Ukraine and its key partners to allow Kyiv to strike targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied long-range weapons. The Kremlin announced that Russia could respond to conventional missile strikes with nuclear arms and indicated that Moscow would treat any attack backed by a nuclear-armed country as a coordinated assault. In late September, Dimon described Russia and its two key allies in its all-out war, Iran and North Korea,&quot; as an &quot;evil axis who are working every day on how to make it worse for the Western world and for America.&quot; North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. The first soldiers to participate alongside Russian forces in the war against Ukraine have been reportedly deployed to the front line in embattled Kursk Oblast. In return, Russia is helping Pyongyang evade sanctions and develop its nuclear capabilities, according to HUR chief Kyrylo Budanov.	https://kyivindependent.com/jpmorgan-chase-ceo-ukraine/	2024-10-25T02:33:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179863701.jpg
Ukraine strikes Russian Buk air defenses, destroys radar guidance system	Ukrainian forces destroyed radar guidance equipment of a Buk-M2 air defense system and struck a Buk-M3 system overnight on Oct. 25 in the occupied part of Luhansk Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said. The attack was carried out by Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces and other military units. The General Staff did not elaborate on other possible damage apart from the destroyed guidance system. The Russian targets were hit &quot;several dozens of kilometers behind the front line,&quot; the statement read. Buk is a family of self-propelled, medium-range air defense systems developed in the 1970s in the Soviet Union. The Buk-M2 and M3 are modernized variants, capable of shooting down aerial targets like tactical ballistic missiles at a range of 50 and 65 kilometers, respectively (30 and 40 miles). Russian proxy forces used a Buk missile to shoot down the MH17 Malaysian airliner over Donetsk Oblast on July 17, 2014, in the early months of the Donbas War. Ukraine previously destroyed a Buk-M3 system overnight on Oct. 21, the military said. Ukrainian forces have destroyed 982 Russian anti-aircraft systems throughout the full-scale war, the General Staff said in its regular morning report on Oct. 25.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-buk-systems/	2024-10-25T01:59:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Buk-M3.jpg
Russian National Guard attacked in Chechnya, 1 killed	Members of the Russian National Guard (Rosgvardiya) came under an attack by unknown assailants in Chechnya, leaving one service member killed and another injured, the guard told the state news agency TASS on Oct. 24. The incident took place near Grozny, the capital of Russia&apos;s predominantly Muslim republic in the North Caucasus ruled by Vladimir Putin&apos;s ally, dictator Ramzan Kadyrov. Chechnya fought two wars of independence against Russia in the 1990s and 2000s, which resulted in Moscow reasserting its rule after a long and bloody conflict. The injured service member was taken to the hospital. Efforts to find and detain the attackers are underway, the guard told TASS, without saying who was behind the attack. According to the Russian Telegram channel Baza, the attack took place around midday on Oct. 24 near the village of Petropavlovskaya, which lies some 10 kilometers (6 miles) northeast of Grozny. Unknown attackers shot at a Ural truck and fled the scene afterward, Baza claimed. The channel shared a picture of the killed serviceman. The Chechen anti-government group Niyso also reported on the attack on its Telegram channel, sharing the footage. The Kyiv Independent is not publishing some of the footage due to its sensitive nature. Pro-Kremlin Chechen fighters (&quot;Kadyrovites&quot;) have been fighting on Russia&apos;s side since the outbreak of the full-scale invasion. In turn, anti-Russian Chechen volunteers have also joined the war on Ukraine&apos;s side, forming several formations like the Dzhokhar Dudayev Battalion.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-national-guard-attacked-in-chechnya/	2024-10-25T01:11:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-24_19-35-53--2--1.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 6, injure 16 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed six people and injured 16 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Oct. 25. Ukrainian forces downed 36 out of 63 Shahed-type drones and other unidentified drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Sixteen more drones were &quot;lost,&quot; it added. The aerial targets were destroyed over 12 oblasts across Ukraine, with around 15 drones downed near Kyiv, according to local authorities. Five people were killed in the settlements of Oleksiyevo-Druzhkivka, Zelene, and Dachenske in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. One more person was injured in the region over the past day. Russian forces attacked the town of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast with an ODAB-1500 air bomb, killing a 73-year-old woman and injuring 10 other people, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. The strike partially destroyed a two-story commercial building and damaged 12 stalls, a kindergarten, and several residential buildings. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 26 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Five people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-6-injure-16-over-past-day/	2024-10-25T01:02:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-24_13-03-25-1.jpg
Russia provided Yemen's Houthis with satellite data to attack vessels in Red Sea, WSJ reports	Yemen&apos;s Houthi militants have been using Russian satellite data to attack ships in the Red Sea with drones and missiles, the Wall Street Journal reported on Oct. 24, citing a person familiar with the matter and two unnamed European defense officials. The Houthis are an Iran-backed militant group based in Yemen. Following Israel&apos;s invasion of Gaza in 2023, the Houthis began launching attacks against Western shipping vessels in the Red Sea. Russian targeting data helped the Houthis expand their strikes, the sources told the WSJ. The data was reportedly handed over through Iran&apos;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Such assistance shows how much Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to undermine the Western economic and political order, the WSJ wrote. According to experts, Russia is trying to foment instability from the Middle East to Asia to cause problems for the U.S. The WSJ reported in early October that infamous Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, who was released in a prisoner swap between Russia and the U.S. in 2022, was suspected of preparing a small arms deal with Houthi militants. Iran, one of Russia&apos;s key allies, was also brokering secret negotiations between Moscow and Yemen&apos;s Houthis to transfer Yakhont supersonic anti-ship missiles, Reuters reported in late September, citing seven unnamed sources.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-provided-yemens-houthis-with-satellite-data-to-attack-vessels-in-red-sea-wsj-reports/	2024-10-24T23:50:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2152895460.jpg
Musk has been in contact with Putin since 2022, WSJ reports	Business tycoon Elon Musk, one of the richest people in the world, has been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Kremlin officials since late 2022, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Oct. 25, citing undisclosed official sources. Musk, known as the founder and CEO of the space and telecom company SpaceX and the owner of the social media platform X, came out in support of Ukraine at the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, donating Starlink communication terminals that greatly assisted Ukrainian defenders. His views progressively shifted toward pro-Russian positions later during the war, and the billionaire prevented Ukraine from using Starlink terminals in strikes on the Russian fleet. He has also complained that he is &quot;losing money&quot; by providing Starlink service to Ukraine. The business tycoon, who has backed the campaign of Republican presidential nominee and ex-U.S. President Donald Trump, has previously denied sympathizing with Moscow and claimed he talked with Putin only once in April 2021 about space-related topics. Former and current European, U.S., and Russian officials told the WSJ that Musk has held further conversations with Putin and other high-ranking Kremlin officials since late 2022. This reportedly included Sergei Kiriyenko, Putin&apos;s first deputy chief of staff, who has been named as the top figure of Russian propaganda and disinformation activities. Since Musk acquired X (formerly known as Twitter), experts have pointed out a sharp rise of disinformation, hate speech, and radical and pro-authoritarian content on the platform. Musk, an avid user of the platform himself, used it to speak out against the passage of a Ukraine aid bill earlier this year and said that &quot;there is no way in hell&quot; that Russia could lose the war. Putin also asked Musk not to activate Starlink over Taiwan as a favor to Beijing, which claims the island as its sovereign territory, the WSJ wrote. Starlink is currently not active in Taiwan. The Kremlin has denied communicating with Musk, and White House officials told the WSJ they are not aware of it. Musk did not respond to the WSJ&apos;s request for comment. According to the WSJ, the contacts are a well-kept secret in the U.S. government due to Musk&apos;s access to sensitive information as a major security and technology contractor. SpaceX, which operates Starlink, was awarded a classified $1.8 billion contract in 2021, reportedly to build a network of spy satellites for U.S. intelligence. Security-related concerns regarding Musk also arose over Russia&apos;s increasing use of Starlink terminals bought via third-party countries, boosting Russian forces as they grind on in Ukraine&apos;s east. Musk said that SpaceX does not sell equipment to Moscow and that it would not operate in Russia. The matter is all the more sensitive as Musk has become an increasingly vocal supporter of Trump, even joining him at a rally in Pennsylvania in early October. The former president said that he could appoint Musk to run a &quot;government efficiency commission&quot; if he wins the election. Trump has previously criticized the support the Biden administration has provided to Ukraine, sparking fears he might withdraw Washington&apos;s support if re-elected on Nov. 5.	https://kyivindependent.com/musk-putin-wsj/	2024-10-24T23:42:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1853200567.jpg
Kyiv preparing internal plan to 'strengthen Ukraine,' Zelensky confirms	Ukraine is developing an internal plan for strengthening the country in the economic, military, informational, and other spheres, President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed in his evening address on Oct. 24. According to Zelensky, the internal plan, together with the victory plan, will ensure that Ukraine &quot;has the right answers to all the challenges of this year and next year.&quot; The confirmation comes days after a source close to the Presidential Office told the Kyiv Independent that Kyiv is preparing an action plan to withstand Russia&apos;s full-scale war. The plan is not an alternative to Zelensky&apos;s victory plan and provides for steps to be taken by Ukraine itself. The president tasked Ukrainian top officials with developing the plan. The president said Ukraine&apos;s economy, countering Russian disinformation, social protection, and &quot;the issue of justice&quot; need to be strengthened. &quot;This plan for internal strengthening will also guarantee Ukraine&apos;s unity,&quot; he added. The plan is expected to be prepared and presented to the Ukrainian public by the end of 2024, BBC Ukraine reported earlier on Oct. 23, citing unnamed government sources. The Kyiv Independent&apos;s source said that it may take several more weeks to develop the document. Zelensky publicly unveiled his five-point victory plan on Oct. 16, which includes Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO placed atop the list. The victory plan also includes a defense aspect, non-nuclear deterrence of Russian aggression, economic growth and cooperation, and post-war security architecture. It is also comprised of three classified addenda that have been shared with international partners. Ukraine&apos;s president said that a victory plan &quot;can bridge the gap between the current situation and the successful peace summit.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-internal-plan/	2024-10-24T23:05:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177266193-1.jpg

Putin acknowledges possible presence of North Korean troops in Russia	Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to indirectly acknowledge reports of North Korean troops in Russia when speaking to foreign journalists on Oct. 24. He referred to the mutual defense clause in Russia and North Korea&#x2019;s newly signed security treaty. Asked about satellite images provided by South Korean intelligence, allegedly showing North Korean soldiers heading to Russia, Putin replied, &quot;images are a serious thing; if there are images, they reflect something,&quot; stopping short of confirming or denying the claims, which the United States has also raised. Putin then pointed to the Russia-North Korea defense treaty, which Russia&#x2019;s parliament ratified on Oct. 24: &quot;As for our relations with the DPRK, the treaty was ratified today; it has Article 4. We have never doubted that North Korean leadership takes the agreement seriously.&quot; Article 4 of the agreement specifies that if either nation faces an &quot;armed invasion,&quot; the other is committed to providing &quot;military and other assistance with all means in its possession.&quot; This provision establishes the closest military alliance between Moscow and Pyongyang since the Cold War. In August, Ukrainian forces crossed into Russia, seizing control of several hundred square miles in the Kursk region. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Oct. 24 that the first North Korean soldiers had been deployed alongside Russian forces on the front line in Kursk Oblast. North Korea has sent around 12,000 troops, including 500 officers and three generals, with initial sightings reported on Oct. 23.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-acknowledges-possible-presence-of-north-korean-troops-in-russia/	2024-10-24T22:00:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178238738.jpg
Sanctions delay to Russian zinc mine results in supply miscalculations, Reuters reports	Western sanctions on Russia&apos;s Ozernoye zinc mine have left the company struggling to replace key equipment needed to boost production, three sources familiar with the situation told Reuters. This shortage is expected to impact global zinc supply forecasts for 2025, with projections likely overstated. Without Ozernoye&#x2019;s significant contribution, the ongoing shortage of zinc concentrate&#x2014;an essential raw material for producing zinc metal used in galvanizing steel&#x2014;is expected to continue. This supply crunch has already driven zinc prices to a 20-month high. Ozernoye has told Reuters it plans to produce zinc concentrate in volumes similar to previous targets, despite these challenges. Ozernoye, which began production in September, aimed to reach full capacity by 2025 with an annual output of about 320,000 metric tons of zinc in concentrate, equivalent to 2.5% of the global mined zinc supply projected for next year, according to the International Lead &amp; Zinc Study Group (ILZSG). The ILZSG had forecast an 8.9% increase in zinc supply outside China for 2025, factoring in Ozernoye&apos;s ramp-up. However, the sources indicated that Ozernoye has not yet produced any material due to difficulties replacing the components needed to process ore into concentrate, which were damaged in a fire in November 2023. These components, originally supplied by Glencore Technology, are no longer available to Ozernoye due to U.S. sanctions imposed after the fire. Glencore, which uses similar equipment in its Australian operations, confirmed it would comply with all sanctions but declined to comment further.	https://kyivindependent.com/sanctions-delay-to-russian-zinc-mine-triggers-supply-miscalculations-reuters-reports/	2024-10-24T19:47:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2144464230.jpg
Moscow funneled $39 million into Moldova ahead of presidential election in attempt to influence results, Moldovan authorities say	Moscow funneled a total of $39 million in a scheme led by a pro-Russian oligarch aimed at influencing election results by paying ordinary citizens to vote against closer ties with the West, the country&apos;s national police chief said on Oct. 24. Ilan Shor, a Moldovan-Israeli tycoon, is accused of laundering the money and orchestrating the network, despite his political party being banned. The election, held on Oct. 20, saw incumbent pro-European Moldovan President Maia Sandu come in first in the initial round of the country&apos;s presidential election on Oct. 20 with 42% of the vote, heading for a run-off on Nov. 3. Voters also voted in favor of a referendum to enshrine the country&apos;s path to European Union accession in the Moldovan constitution by a razor-thin margin, in a blow to supporters who wanted to see closer ties to Russia. Moldovan authorities said that in September over $15 million in Russian funds had been funneled to over 130,000 Moldovans, with voters instructed on how to vote and spread disinformation about the EU via Telegram. Another $24 million was &quot;poured&quot; in throughout the month of October, authorities said, Moldova media reported. At the time, Moldova&#x2019;s chief of police, Viorel Cern&#x103;u&#x21B;eanu, told POLITICO that &quot;Moldova is facing a phenomenon of voter bribery, combined with hybrid warfare and disinformation, the likes of which our country has never seen before.&quot; Moldova&apos;s Foreign Ministry said that police raids are ongoing for those involved in the operations law enforcement officers.

Ukraine cannot join NATO while at war, Scholz says	Speaking to German public broadcaster ZDF on Oct. 24, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed Kyiv&apos;s appeals for an immediate invitation to join NATO, stating that &quot;a country at war absolutely cannot become a member of NATO.&quot; &quot;Everyone knows that, there is no disagreement on this subject,&quot; Scholz added. The comments appear to be the first public comments made by Scholz on Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations since President Volodymyr Zelensky unveiled his five-point victory plan to Western allies, which includes Kyiv&apos;s invitation to join NATO placed at the top of the list. Germany was reportedly previously known to have reservations about the move. According to the information obtained by the Kyiv Independent, Kyiv had planned to ask for NATO membership within months, not years. Kyiv submitted its application to join in September 2022, and in July 2024 the alliance affirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership&quot; &#x2014; though Ukraine has not received any definitive news about its future accession. During the interview, Scholz said that NATO allies &quot;have described a perspective&quot; on Ukraine&apos;s eventual accession to the alliance, adding &quot;but I think that beyond that, there is currently no need for any new decision.&quot; Further rejecting Zelensky&apos;s calls for an invitation to join the alliance as outlined in the victory plan, Scholz said that &quot;an invitation is normally quite quickly linked to membership.&quot; Earlier this week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Germany has softened its stance on Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership, but remains &quot;skeptical.&quot; &quot;But still, the U.S. will have an impact on this (skepticism)... We believe that they are consolidating their thoughts on NATO and this has an impact on, for example, Hungary and Slovakia,&quot; Zelensky said on Oct. 22. According to Zelensky, who has repeatedly called on partners to issue a membership invitation to Kyiv, Ukraine will join NATO only after Russia&apos;s full-scale war ends, the president said in April. Earlier on Oct. 24, following a meeting Scholz in Berlin, Slovak President Peter Pellegrini said that Ukraine&apos;s immediate accession to NATO was &quot;not realistic.&quot; &quot;We agreed with the Chancellor that today the issue of Ukraine&apos;s accession is not on the table, and it cannot come to the table,&quot; Pellegrini said. Pellegrini&apos;s comments come just a day after Politico reported that at least seven NATO countries are reluctant to grant Ukraine an invitation to join NATO, according to four anonymous U.S. and NATO officials and diplomats. Outgoing U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith told reporters that NATO does not currently have plans to invite Ukraine into the alliance in the immediate future.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-cannot-join-nato-immediately-scholz-says/	2024-10-24T14:10:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175014888.jpg
Uzbekistan refuses to join Eurasian Economic Union, which includes Russia	Tashkent has no intention of joining the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), which includes Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, the Moscow Times reported on Oct. 24, citing Akmal Saidov, First Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Chamber of the Uzbek Parliament. As the full-scale invasion began, several allies started to distance themselves from Moscow to avoid potential economic sanctions, among other reasons. In mid-October, Kazakhstan announced it would not join the BRICS, where Russia is a founding member. While, in early September, Armenia announced that it had frozen its membership &quot;at all levels&quot; in another Russian-led alliance, the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin arrived in Tashkent in August to hold talks with Uzbek officials about potentially joining the EAEU, which Russian President Vladimir Putin has called the new &quot;center of a multipolar world.&quot; Following a meeting with Uzbek Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov, Mishustin promised Tashkent &quot;business benefits,&quot; &quot;new markets,&quot; and &quot;fair competition.&quot; Despite the Russian promises, a parliamentary commission that studied about a thousand of the EAEU&apos;s foundational documents &quot;did not find any benefits for Uzbekistan,&quot; Saidov said. Saidov added that Kazakhstan has not benefited much from its participation in the EAEU either, and thus, it will be &quot;optimal&quot; for Uzbekistan to remain in observer status and maintain its independence and sovereignty. At the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Uzbekistan declared that it did not recognize the proxy authorities in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and supported Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity. Tashkent continues to actively trade with Moscow, and the Uzbek government maintains close ties with the Russian leadership. On May 26, Putin arrived in Uzbekistan&apos;s capital to discuss strengthening bilateral relations with President Shavkat Mirziyoyev. That visit marked Putin&apos;s third international trip since his inauguration for the fifth presidential term, secured in the March election broadly seen as rigged.	https://kyivindependent.com/uzbekistan-refuses-to-join-eurasian-economic-union-which-includes-russia/	2024-10-24T13:20:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2154375705.jpg
Ukraine's immediate accession to NATO 'not realistic,' Slovak president says following meeting with Scholz	Following a meeting in Berlin with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Oct. 24, Slovakian President Peter Pellegrini said that Ukraine&apos;s immediate accession to NATO was &quot;not realistic.&quot; &quot;We agreed with the Chancellor that today the issue of Ukraine&apos;s accession is not on the table, and it cannot come to the table,&quot; Pellegrini said. Neither Scholz nor his office have publicly commented on the country&apos;s views of Ukraine&apos;s five-point victory plan, which includes Kyiv&apos;s invitation to join NATO placed at the top of the list &#x2014; although Germany is reportedly already known to have reservations about the move. President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier this week that Germany has softened its stance on Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership, but remains &quot;skeptical.&quot; Slovak media reported that Pellegrini told reporters that Zelensky&apos;s proposed plan was not seen &quot;as a done deal.&quot; Pellegrini is an ally of Prime Minister Robert Fico, who has been a vocal critic of military aid for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia.

Ukraine says it has recipe for ‘long-range capabilities,’ only needs financial backing	Ukraine says it has the know-how to produce more much-needed drones as well as missiles for strikes deep into Russia, and all it needs is financial backing from Western allies. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve got all the knowledge, we&apos;ve got all the capabilities in place,&#x201D; Alexander Kamyshin, advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky for strategic affairs, told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 24. Kamyshin, the former Minister of Strategic Industries who has overseen Ukraine&#x2019;s domestic weaponry manufacturing for a year and a half before taking on his new advisor role last month, said Kyiv is asking allies for financial backing to achieve its battlefield-tested innovation and production potential. He spoke after a months-long push by Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials pleading for the U.S. and other allies to approve the use of their missiles for strikes deep inside Russia, an effort which Kyiv appears to have not given up on despite an apparent lack of success. Ukraine has so far relied heavily on massive weaponry supplies from NATO members, but Kamyshin said Ukraine could, on its own with funding, produce more sophisticated kit using priceless experience gained through more than two and a half years of fighting back against Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Alexander Kamyshin in Berlin, Germany, Sep. 19, 2022. (Carsten Koall/picture alliance via Getty Images)&#x201C;Our capabilities are significantly higher than the funding available, so it&apos;s a significant amount of money, but we discuss it with our partners,&#x201D; Kamyshin said, declining to disclose the estimate needed. President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Oct. 21 that the U.S. is expected to provide Ukraine with $1.6 billion for its domestic long-range weapon production. Ukraine would receive the first tranche of $800 million in the &quot;coming days,&quot; and the second tranche of $700 million to $800 million afterwards, the president said after this week&#x2019;s visit of U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to Kyiv. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said at a September event that Ukraine&#x2019;s potential for domestic production could reach $20 billion with foreign investment &#x2014; more than three times the estimated 2024 projection from last year. Western allies&#x2019; apparent shift of focus to allocating substantial money on Ukraine&#x2019;s long-range strike development rather than providing their own kits comes after Kyiv&#x2019;s months-long pleas for permission to strike deep into Russia with Western weaponry yielded no results. The future of Western military aid is becoming ever more uncertain, with the high-stakes U.S. presidential election coming up in early November. Both presidential candidates remain vague on their Ukraine policy, with Republican candidate Donald Trump skeptical about further U.S. support for Kyiv and Vice President Kamala Harris on the Democratic ticket not addressing it in detail. Though Moscow has the initiative across most of the front line, Kyiv has regularly struck targets such as arms depots, oil refineries, and airfields hundreds of kilometers inside Russia. For Ukraine, the slingshot strikes deep into Russia are essential to reduce the bigger foe&#x2019;s combat capability from afar. &#x201C;We proved that we can reach deep inside Russia, and for that reason, we believe that funding the procurement of things made in Ukraine is a good move for our partners,&#x201D; Kamyshin said, referring to the series of strikes. His comments also refer to technological advancements made by Kyiv that could be shared with allies in fast-developing future warfare tactics, including the massive use of drones in the air, on the ground, and at sea in an asymmetric war where Russia has the conventional firepower advantage. Kamyshin said that Ukraine has &#x201C;commitments&#x201D; from allies, including the U.S., Denmark, and Lithuania, to fund the procurement of Ukrainian-made deep-strike capabilities. &#x201C;So, at this point, we are at the point of finalizing arrangements on funding this procurement,&#x201D; Kamyshin said. A growing number of Western allies are funding Ukrainian weaponry development and have taken on joint production projects to compete against Russia&#x2019;s massive Soviet-era stocks with cutting-edge technologies. U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey also said on Oct. 22 that his country would lend almost $3 billion for the production of long-range drones. Lithuania announced in September that it is investing $11 million in the development of Ukraine&#x2019;s long-range &#x201C;Palianytsia&#x201D; weapon. Zelensky confirmed the first successful use of the new Ukrainian &#x201C;missile drone&#x201D; in late August. &#x201C;All co-production and all investments in defense manufacturing are very important to us. This is a priority today,&#x201D; Zelensky said during the visit of Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda in September. &#x201C;Right now, everyone can see how successful Ukraine is in developing and deploying its long-range weapons and long-range drones.&#x201D; Zelensky said at the Second International Forum of Defense Industries in October that Ukraine can now produce 4 million drones a year and already has contracts to manufacture 1.5 million. Ukraine has refrained from revealing more about missiles due to sensitivity of the issue. Kamyshin declined to reveal the details about the long-range weapons being developed, including whether they would include Ukraine&apos;s homemade Hrim-2 (Grim-2) ballistic missile. Another Ukrainian-developed missile, the Neptune, was used in 2022 to sink the Moskva, the flagship of Russia&apos;s Black Sea Fleet based in the occupied Crimean Peninsula. Ukraine has come a long way in honing its homemade drones to bring the war to Russia. Kamyshin said Ukraine started striking deep inside Russia in late 2023, and the Ukrainian engineering capabilities have been &quot;growing on and on.&#x201D; &#x201C;We see an increase in the interest of our Western allies in funding things procured from Ukrainian producers,&#x201D; Kamyshin said. &#x201C;We proved that they are capable.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-says-it-has-recipe-for-long-range-capabilities-only-needs-financial-backing/	2024-10-24T11:30:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/2022-04-2560px-neptune-cruise-missile-05-1024x689.jpg
Ukraine war latest: First North Korean troops arrive in Kursk Oblast to participate in Russia's war against Ukraine	Key developments on Oct. 24: The first North Korean soldiers to participate alongside Russian forces in the war against Ukraine have been deployed to the front line in Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Oct. 24. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals. The first sightings of North Korean soldiers were recorded on Oct. 23. These soldiers are reportedly receiving training at five military training grounds in Ekaterinoslavka, Knyaze-Volkonskoe, and Sergeevka, as well as in Ussuriysk and Ulan-Ude in eastern Russia. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yunus-bek Yevkurov has been appointed to supervise the training and adaptation of the North Korean troops, who are given &quot;a few weeks&quot; to adjust, according to HUR&apos;s report. The North Korean military is provided with ammunition, bedding, winter clothing, footwear, and hygiene products. According to Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence, each soldier receives 50 meters of toilet paper and 300 grams of soap each month. Ukrainian intelligence claimed that Russia has &quot;high hopes&quot; for the participation of North Korean soldiers in the war. North Korea has denied reports of North Korean troop presence in Russia, while a Kremlin spokesperson provided an evasive response. A military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 21 that Russian authorities detained 18 North Korean soldiers who abandoned their positions in Kursk Oblast. Video footage has also emerged, allegedly showing North Korean troops at a Russian military training camp. Additionally, South Korean media reported on Oct. 22 that Pyongyang has dispatched pilots capable of flying Russian warplanes to join the conflict in Ukraine. South Korea&apos;s Yonhap agency also stated that South Korea is considering sending personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops. North Korean troops deployed to fight for Russia against Ukraine are &quot;fair game,&quot; U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Oct. 23. Earlier in the day, the U.S. made its first public confirmation that it had evidence of Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers being sent to Russia, following previous reports from Ukraine and South Korea. Kyiv and Seoul say Moscow is planning to involve thousands of North Korean troops in its full-scale war. &quot;If they do deploy to fight against Ukraine, they&apos;re fair game, they&apos;re fair targets, and the Ukrainian military will defend themselves against North Korean soldiers the same way they&apos;re defending themselves against Russian soldiers,&quot; Kirby told a press briefing at the White House. &quot;And so the possibility that there could be dead and wounded North Korean soldiers&#x2026; is absolutely real if they get deployed.&quot; Kirby also revealed details of U.S. intelligence assessments, saying Washington believes North Korea &quot;moved at least 3000 soldiers into eastern Russia.&quot; &quot;We assess that these soldiers traveled by ship from the Wan area in North Korea to Vladivostok, Russia,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;These soldiers then traveled onward to multiple Russian military training sites in eastern Russia where they are currently undergoing training.&quot; Kirby said it was too early to say for sure if they &quot;will enter into combat alongside the Russian military,&quot; but added it was a &quot;highly concerning probability.&quot; &quot; We have briefed the Ukrainian government on our understanding of this situation, and we&apos;re certainly consulting closely with other allies, partners and countries in the region on the implications of such a dramatic move, and on how we might respond,&quot; he said. &quot;I expect to have more to share on all of that in the coming days.&quot; South Korea could review its ban on supplying lethal arms to Ukraine in light of &quot;North Korean military activities,&quot; President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Oct. 24. &quot;If North Korea dispatches special forces to the Ukraine war, we will provide support to Ukraine step by step and consider taking necessary measures for the security of the Korean Peninsula,&quot; Yoon said in a joint press conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda in Seoul. &quot;We have adhered to a principle of not directly supplying lethal weapons, but we can review this more flexibly depending on North Korean military activities,&quot; he added. South Korean law prohibits the exporting of weapons to active conflict zones, but Seoul has repeatedly hinted that this could change in light of deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. Both Yoon and Duda denounced the dispatch of North Korean troops to Russia, describing it as a &quot;direct violation of the U.N. Charter and U.N. Security Council resolutions,&quot; in comments reported by South Korea&apos;s Yonhap news agency. &quot;(South Korea) will never sit idle over this and take necessary measures step by step in coordination with the international community depending on the development of N. Korea-Russia military cooperation,&quot; Yoon added. So far, Seoul has only provided humanitarian and non-lethal military aid to Kyiv, but has been indirectly supplying Ukraine with ammunition, in particular 155mm artillery shells, via the U.S. However, experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent earlier this week said South Korea is unlikely to begin supplying weapons directly anytime soon, as Seoul is restricted by its own legislation. &quot;It&apos;s been a consistent stance because it is law. It&apos;s not just a policy choice,&quot; Jenny Town, senior fellow at the Stimson Center and director of Stimson&apos;s Korea Program and 38 North, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The president can&apos;t just say, &apos;Hey, I&apos;ve changed my mind; here&apos;s what we&apos;re going to do now,&apos; it really does require actual legislation to be passed.&quot; Yoon&apos;s approval rating this week dropped to 24.1 percent, the lowest level since he took office in 2022. Town said he lacks the bipartisan support required to pass legislation because he is in &quot;such a weak position right now.&quot; &quot;If there was going to be greater military assistance to Ukraine, it&apos;s more likely to be by increasing indirect channels,&quot; Town adds. Russian troops are attempting to establish crossings near the Oskil River to advance toward the city of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast, according to Ruslan Muzychuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s National Guard, who spoke on national television on Oct. 24. Kupiansk is a strategically significant city in Kharkiv Oblast that was temporarily occupied by Russian forces in 2022. In recent months, the city has faced heavy attacks as Russia intensified its offensive in the area. Russian forces have become increasingly active near Kupiansk, particularly following an attempted renewed offensive in Kharkiv. &quot;The enemy is now also concentrating its main efforts on reaching... the Oskil River. Near the river, the enemy is trying to set up crossings,&quot; Muzychuk said. In the Kupiansk sector of the front line, Russian troops have recently increased their use of armored vehicles. Active hostilities have been reported in the areas surrounding the settlements of Tabaiivka, Pishchane, and Kolysnikivka. The Russian army attempted to seize the Oskil River crossing and expand its offensive on the eastern bank, but Ukrainian National Guard troops successfully halted this advance, as reported by Oleksandr Pivnenko, the commander of Ukraine&apos;s National Guard, on Oct. 20. On Oct. 18, Ukrainian forces liberated and &quot;cleared out&quot; the village of Kruhliakivka in Kharkiv Oblast of Russian soldiers. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) described Kruhliakivka as important for the defense of Kupiansk. Ukrainian military, lawmakers, and experts discussed the creation of a separate branch of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces dedicated to cyberspace operations, the General Staff said on Oct. 24. &quot;The creation of Cyber Forces as a separate branch will significantly enhance the capabilities of the Ukrainian army, ensure effective planning and implementation of the full range of tasks in cyberspace, which, along with land, sea, air and space, is recognized as a separate operational domain,&quot; the statement read. The participants of the meeting reviewed the main provisions of a draft concept of the branch, and defined the main functions and tasks of any future cyber army. They also examined the experience of Western cyber forces, and analyzed the relevant experience of the Ukrainian army during Russia&apos;s all-out war. At the beginning of the Russian full-scale invasion, Ukraine launched an IT army, which was joined by thousands of specialists in the first days of February 2022. It has reportedly carried out multiple cyberattack on Russian online websites.Russian hackers have also regularly targeted various Ukrainian government institutions as well as businesses with crippling cyberattacks aimed at disrupting numerous industries and government services.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-first-north-korean-troops-arrive-in-kursk-oblast-to-participate-in-russias-war-against-ukraine/	2024-10-24T11:27:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029632286.jpg

Why did Ukraine's prosecutor general resign, and who will replace him?	The formal reason for Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin&apos;s resignation on Oct. 22 was the ongoing major corruption scandal involving hundreds of prosecutors who obtained disability benefits, including financial support, the ability to evade the military draft and leave the country at will. A crucial question is whether Kostin&apos;s resignation will solve the problem of fake disability documents and corruption at the prosecutor&apos;s office in general and whether his replacement will be any better. Some anti-corruption activists see him as a scapegoat blamed for the scandal. &quot;The resignation was supposed to ease public tension,&quot; Olena Shcherban, a deputy executive director at the Kyiv-based NGO Anti-Corruption Action Center, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;But will it solve the problem? We are still very far from that.&quot; A number of experts have also mentioned other reasons that might have led to Kostin&apos;s dismissal, apart from the ongoing scandal. Although Kostin was appointed to the job as a loyalist of President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022, the President&apos;s Office could have been unhappy with the prosecutor&apos;s decision to greenlight corruption cases against lawmakers from the president&apos;s party, according to Shcherban and Yury Nikolov, an investigative journalist who has exposed top-level corruption. The President&apos;s Office has also been reportedly unhappy with Kostin&apos;s frequent trips abroad, according to Oleksandr Lemenov, head of anti-corruption watchdog StateWatch. Lemenov and Nikolov also said, citing their sources, that Kostin had allegedly been wanting to resign himself. &#x201C;I think he was on his way out already and was hoping to get an ambassadorial post in The Hague,&quot; a source familiar with decision-making in Zelensky&#x2019;s office told the Kyiv Independent. Overall, the experts polled by the Kyiv Independent see Kostin&apos;s track record as mixed. On the one hand, they say he has not scored any great achievements, and there were no efforts to reform the corrupt prosecutor&apos;s office. On the other hand, Kostin did not block or sabotage any high-profile cases, they argue. Kostin&apos;s spokesperson, Nadiya Maksimets, told the Kyiv Independent he was not immediately available for comment. The President&apos;s Office did not respond to requests for comment. Kostin&apos;s resignation came amid reports of prosecutors illegally obtaining disability status en masse. Kostin said on Oct. 20 that only in Khmelnytskyi Oblast 61 prosecutors had obtained disability certificates. Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) Head Vasyl Maliuk said on Oct. 22 that the SBU had exposed corruption schemes at medical examination commissions in 2024, resulting in the cancellation of 4,106 fake disability status certificates. Kostin submitted his resignation after a National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) meeting chaired by Zelensky. During the meeting, the &quot;immoral situation&quot; with the fake disabilities of prosecutors was discussed, and &quot;many shameful facts of abuse&quot; were revealed, according to Kostin. &quot;I am grateful to the president of Ukraine and Ukraine&apos;s Verkhovna Rada for their trust. But in this situation, I believe it is right for me to resign from the post of prosecutor general,&quot; he said. Kostin&apos;s resignation has yet to be approved by the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s parliament. Shcherban from the Anti-Corruption Action Center said that Kostin had become a scapegoat blamed by the authorities for the scandal with fake disability certificates. She said that the problem of prosecutors&apos; involvement in such corrupt practices had existed long before Kostin. Prosecutor of Ukraine Andriy Kostin at the &quot;Ukraine. Year 2024&quot; forum in Kyiv, Ukraine on Feb. 25, 2024. (Andriy Zhyhaylo/Obozrevatel/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)&quot;It&apos;s a result of systemic problems and a lack of the desire to reform the prosecutor&apos;s office,&quot; she told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The reform of the prosecutor&apos;s office has failed.&quot; Shcherban added that previous efforts under former Prosecutor General Ruslan Riaboshapka to vet prosecutors and fire those who did not meet integrity and professionalism standards stalled after he was fired in 2020. Nikolov, who has investigated corruption in the defense ministry and law enforcement, dismissed the decision to blame Kostin as &quot;populism.&quot; &quot;Kostin is not the cause of the problem,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. Nikolov believes the cause is the corrupt system, and Kostin, however, should have been tasked with reforming the prosecutor&apos;s office and firing corrupt prosecutors instead of evading this responsibility. Another reason for Kostin&apos;s resignation could have been that Kostin didn&apos;t obstruct corruption investigations, even against those who were close to the President&apos;s Office. The President&apos;s Office could have been unhappy with Kostin authorizing charges for lawmakers from Zelensky&apos;s Servant of the People party brought by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), Shcherban said. Nikolov also said that, according to his sources, Kostin had seldom communicated with the President&apos;s Office, and there had been some tension between him and the President&apos;s Office. The Kyiv Independent couldn&apos;t independently verify this claim. In August, Vitaly Shabunin, head of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, accused the President&apos;s Office of allowing pro-government lawmaker Artem Dmytryk to flee abroad before being charged with beating a law enforcement officer and a soldier. Another Servant of the People lawmaker, Andriy Odarchenko, fled Ukraine through Zakarpattia Oblast in September before being charged with bribery. Odarchenko has admitted being friends with Viktor Mykyta, former governor of Zakarpattia Oblast and currently a deputy head of the President&apos;s Office. The blame had been placed on the prosecutor general for allowing this to happen. Another source of tension between Kostin and the President&apos;s Office could have been his frequent trips abroad, according to Lemenov. Kostin spent 103 days on foreign business trips in 2023, the Ukrainska Pravda news outlet reported in April, citing Kostin&apos;s asset declaration, law enforcement sources, and a response to an official request by lawmaker Oleksiy Honcharenko. He spent half of the trips in the U.S., where his wife lives, according to the news outlet. Anti-corruption activists say Kostin&apos;s track record as prosecutor general remains mixed. &quot;I don&apos;t see either great achievements or great failures (under Kostin),&quot; Shcherban said. The upside is that Kostin did not block NABU cases, in contrast with his predecessor Iryna Venediktova, according to Shcherban and Nikolov. Shcherban said &quot;Kostin worried about his reputation among international partners.&quot; Venediktova has denied the accusations of sabotage. One of the achievements under Kostin that the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office itself has highlighted is the investigation of Russian war crimes. Yury Belousov, head of the war crimes department at the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office, said in early October that 708 Russian soldiers had been charged with war crimes since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, and 131 out of them had been convicted. Lemenov was more skeptical, arguing that &quot;anyone would be considered more effective if compared with Venediktova.&quot; He called Kostin a &quot;hidden or shadow prosecutor&quot; due to his alleged inactivity.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)&quot;Two years and three months have passed (since Kostin was appointed as prosecutor general),&quot; Lemenov said. &quot;Whether he was there or not makes no difference.&quot; Lemenov added that he had been appointed to several vetting commissions by Kostin but there had been no efforts by the prosecutor general to reform or fix Ukraine&apos;s stagnant prosecution. Before being appointed as prosecutor general, Kostin applied for the job of the chief anti-corruption prosecutor in 2021-2022. Several civic watchdogs, including the Anti-Corruption Action Center, AutoMaidan, Dejure, and Transparency International, concluded then that Kostin did not meet ethics and integrity standards and violated the principle of political neutrality. The watchdogs saw him as being too close to Zelensky and his administration. Eventually he was vetoed by a panel including international experts and did not get the job. The panel based its veto on the accusations of nepotism and alleged violations in Kostin&apos;s asset declarations. He denied the accusations of wrongdoing. Kostin has also been criticized for visiting Russian-occupied Crimea in 2015 and 2018. He argued that he had visited a doctor on the occupied peninsula. Regardless of Kostin&apos;s track record, the &quot;crucial question is who will replace him,&quot; Shcherban said. There is a high likelihood that his successor will be worse and less independent than Kostin, she added. Nikolov said that his resignation would only make sense if Kostin were replaced with an effective prosecutor general who would reform the prosecutor&apos;s office and fire those responsible for violations. Potential candidates allegedly being considered as a replacement for Kostin include Odesa Oblast Governor Oleh Kiper and Kyiv Oblast Governor Ruslan Kravchenko, according to Shcherban and Lemenov. NV, a Ukrainian media outlet, also reported on Oct. 23, citing their sources at the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office and the Verkhovna Rada, that Kravchenko could replace Kostin. Shcherban said that Kravchenko and Kiper are seen as loyalists of the President&apos;s Office, and Kiper has a controversial reputation. Kiper has been involved in a corruption scandal following the publication of an investigation by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&apos;s Schemes project on Oct. 23. Alleged prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;s and business partners of Kiper have acquired assets belonging to a sanctioned Russian businessman, Schemes reported. Kiper denied having business links to them.	https://kyivindependent.com/why-did-ukraines-prosecutor-general-resign-and-who-will-replace-him/	2024-10-24T10:50:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2168105618.jpg
Opinion: Canceled Ramstein meeting marks a missed opportunity for Europe to lead on Ukraine	A short trip to Germany instead of the planned state visit. A four-way meeting in the Chancellery instead of the conference in Ramstein to coordinate future aid for Ukraine with some 50 participating states, including numerous heads of state and government. With Hurricane Milton in Florida preventing U.S. President Joe Biden from adhering to his planned itinerary, the entire European political scene was thrown off course. There is no other way to describe the events of the last 14 days. Worse yet, what happened &#x2014; or, more accurately, what didn&#x2019;t happen &#x2014; in Germany exemplifies the desolate state of European foreign and security policy at a critical moment. Why did the Ramstein conference have to be canceled? Was it only because the American president couldn&#x2019;t be there? Were the Europeans not strong enough to host a conference without the participation of the American president, or, if necessary, with the U.S. Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense present? The just-completed German-United Kingdom defense pact suggests that where there is a will, action can be taken. But Europe needs more than such narrowly tailored bilateral agreements, no matter how positive they can be. The reason is abundantly clear: Ukraine is desperately waiting for more help. The third winter of the war Russian President Vladimir Putin launched in February 2022 is just around the corner, and the country&#x2019;s situation is getting worse by the week. That Ukraine will get &#x201C;all the help it needs, and it will get it for as long as it needs it,&#x201D; has been the routine refrain heard in most European capitals, especially from the German government, for two and a half years. But this claim is simply wrong, no matter how many times it is repeated. The history of aid to Ukraine is a history of constant dithering and hesitation, of stalling and tactics. When nothing else helps, the American president is called upon to break the political logjam.

(Michael Kappeler/picture alliance via Getty Images)But Biden spent much of this year, before his withdrawal from the presidential race, on the campaign trail. Now he is on a farewell tour. A new president will be elected on Nov. 5, and if his name is Donald Trump, there will be no slipstream for the Europeans to hide in. The canceled Ramstein conference would have been the perfect opportunity for Europe to at long last take the lead. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz should have shown what the &quot;Zeitenwende&quot; (&#x201C;turning point&#x201D;) which Scholz declared following Russia&#x2019;s invasion means for Europe as a whole. Together with France and Great Britain, he should have made clear statements to Putin: If you did not end your war of terror against Ukraine&#x2019;s civilian population within 24 hours, they could have said, the range limits on the weapons being supplied to Ukraine will be lifted. If that were not enough, it could have been added that Germany would supply Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine to help destroy the Russian army&#x2019;s supply routes into the country. France and Great Britain are already supplying cruise missiles with the range needed to hit the Russian army&#x2019;s supply lines and are apparently prepared to go down this path. Fear and the desperate hope of being able to portray himself as a &#x201C;peace chancellor&#x201D; shortly before Germany&#x2019;s federal election next year have become Scholz&#x2019;s dominant motives. But &#x201C;fear is the mother of all cruelty,&#x201D; as Michel de Montaigne, the sixteenth-century French philosopher, put it. French President Emmanuel Macron has no doubt read Montaigne and understands that warning. Instead of acting decisively at Ramstein, Scholz had a nice coffee with Biden, shortly before the U.S. president was awarded the special level of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. But that award ceremony was a moment that united Great Britain, France, Germany, and the U.S. merely in nostalgia, not in defining the decisive action and sense of purpose which Europe needs today. Indeed, the ceremony recalled nothing so much as how Germany&#x2019;s government behaved in the years before the fall of the Berlin Wall and reunification, before the division of Europe was overcome, before the war in Ukraine. The old Europe of the Cold War sought comfort in the past and confidence in the solitary U.S. leadership that defined the era. Europeans forging their own decisions were rarely even an afterthought back then. For example, did no one even think of inviting Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk to the meeting in Berlin? Biden&#x2019;s flight back to Washington following the aborted Ramstein conference and the diminished meeting in Berlin&#x2019;s Chancellery may take on an almost symbolic significance in the future: the last Atlanticist U.S. president for a long time bidding farewell to Europe. And the Europeans, without leadership and without the slightest idea of what lies ahead, waving goodbye to him, dreamily reminiscing about earlier times.

First North Korean troops deployed to front line in Kursk Oblast, Ukraine's military intelligence says	The first North Korean soldiers to participate alongside Russian forces in the war against Ukraine have been deployed to the front line in Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Oct. 24. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals. The first sightings of North Korean soldiers were recorded on Oct. 23. These soldiers are reportedly receiving training at five military training grounds in Ekaterinoslavka, Knyaze-Volkonskoe, and Sergeevka, as well as in Ussuriysk and Ulan-Ude in eastern Russia. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yunus-bek Yevkurov has been appointed to supervise the training and adaptation of the North Korean troops, who are given &quot;a few weeks&quot; to adjust, according to HUR&apos;s report. The North Korean military is provided with ammunition, bedding, winter clothing, footwear, and hygiene products. According to Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence, each soldier receives 50 meters of toilet paper and 300 grams of soap each month. Ukrainian intelligence claimed that Russia has &quot;high hopes&quot; for the participation of North Korean soldiers in the war. North Korea has denied reports of North Korean troop presence in Russia, while a Kremlin spokesperson provided an evasive response. A military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 21 that Russian authorities detained 18 North Korean soldiers who abandoned their positions in Kursk Oblast. Video footage has also emerged, allegedly showing North Korean troops at a Russian military training camp. Additionally, South Korean media reported on Oct. 22 that Pyongyang has dispatched pilots capable of flying Russian warplanes to join the conflict in Ukraine. South Korea&apos;s Yonhap agency also stated that South Korea is considering sending personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/first-north-korean-troops-deployed-to-front-line-in-kursk-oblast-ukraines-military-intelligence-says/	2024-10-24T10:02:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029588238--1-.jpg
US urges G7 to consider sanctions on Russian palladium, titanium, Bloomberg says	The United States has urged its G7 allies to consider sanctions on Russian palladium and titanium, Bloomberg reported on Oct. 23, citing an unnamed source. Officials from U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration raised the possibility of these sanctions during a G7 deputy finance ministers meeting on Oct. 22 in Washington, D.C. The U.S. proposed initiating discussions to further weaken Russia&apos;s economy, according to the source. Palladium is essential for producing computer chips and car catalysts, while titanium is critical for manufacturing airplanes and medical implants. However, Europe&#x2019;s reliance on these metals poses a significant challenge. G7 members Germany, France, and Italy would need support from the other 24 European Union members to impose such sanctions. Washington has already blacklisted Russian titanium, but these metals are vital to global supply chains, and Western governments are cautious about potential market disruptions. The West has long struggled to determine its approach to sanctioning Russian metals. In December, palladium prices rose 12% amid speculation of future sanctions after London imposed restrictions on certain Russian metals. Earlier this year, the U.S. and U.K. imposed sanctions on Russian aluminum, copper, and nickel.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-urges-g7-to-consider-sanctions-on-russian-palladium-titanium-bloomberg-says/	2024-10-24T09:11:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-959103712.jpg
Zelensky won’t sign bill to end daylight saving time, media says	President Volodymyr Zelensky has no plans to sign a bill abolishing seasonal daylight saving time in Ukraine, BBC Ukraine reported on Oct. 24, citing anonymous sources. Parliament passed the bill on July 16, which aimed to cancel daylight saving time in Ukraine. This means that Ukrainians would set their clocks back one hour for the last time on Oct. 27, 2024, and will not revert back to summer time next spring. The bill, signed by parliamentary speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk, was sent to Zelensky on Aug. 21 but remains unsigned. BBC sources in both the president&apos;s team and the parliamentary presidential faction confirmed the bill will not be signed. The bill, lobbied by Stefanchuk, will not be vetoed but will also not be enacted. The government reportedly calculated losses from the change at &quot;several billion hryvnias.&quot; Many countries in Europe, North America, and elsewhere have adopted daylight saving time to make better use of longer daylight in summer. The clock is set forward by one hour in the spring and then reverted back in autumn. The continued use of the practice has been hotly debated in the EU, and 84% of respondents polled in 2018 spoke in favor of its abolishment. While the European Parliament voted in 2021 to cancel the system, no final decision has been taken and the practice remains in use in much of Europe. In spite of this, Ukrainian lawmakers presented the change as a step toward EU integration.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-wont-sign-bill-to-end-daylight-saving-time-media-says/	2024-10-24T08:32:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178873740.jpg
Auchan in final negotiations with local buyer to exit Russian market, media reports	Auchan, one of the few French chains still operating in Russia, is in final negotiations to sell its Russian subsidiary to a local buyer, French media La Lettre reported on Oct. 24. In March 2022, Auchan CEO Yves Claude told the outlet Journal du Dimanche that the company would not leave Russia despite accusations of financing the war, citing the need to keep employees and continue &quot;feeding the populations of both Ukraine and Russia.&quot; At the start of the full-scale invasion, Russia reportedly accounted for 10% of Auchan&apos;s global sales. Claude also noted that 30,000 people, including 40% of employees and shareholders, could lose their jobs if the company exited the market. The holding company Mulliez, which owns Auchan, is expected to finalize the sale in the coming weeks. The buyer has not been named. Auchan will also need approval from Russian commissions. Auchan is reportedly eager to sell as Russia&apos;s &quot;exit tax&quot; has increased from 10% to 15%, with the potential to reach 35%, according to La Lettre, citing RBC Russian. Selling just the assets would bring less than 200 million euro ($216 million), but the sale of 94 hypermarkets and 138 supermarkets, including the buildings, could increase the value significantly. Auchan, which has 43 stores in Ukraine, also remains active in the country. Sales in Russia and Ukraine, which fell 4.2% last year, dragged down Auchan Retail&#x2019;s overall performance by 2%. Without these countries, growth would have been 4%. The company posted a net loss of 378 million euro ($408 million) for the year. French media Le Figaro reported that Auchan has struggled over the past 2.5 years due to tough competition from Russian oligarch-owned distributors.	https://kyivindependent.com/auchan-in-final-negotiations-with-local-buyer-to-exit-russian-market-media-reports/	2024-10-24T07:27:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1239550139.jpg
‘I want to come home as a hero’ – Ukraine’s convict soldiers prepare to fight Russia	Editor&#x2019;s note: In accordance with the security protocols of the Ukrainian military, soldiers featured in this story are identified by first names and callsigns only. DONETSK OBLAST &#x2013; Sitting around in the long, dry grass outside an abandoned village house, two dozen men in summer military fatigues listen attentively to a morning lesson. &#x201C;We engage here. These people who were in these positions here run 20 meters across the open area and defend here,&#x201D; lectures the young instructor, flicking his marker across the whiteboard to represent rifle fire. &#x201C;If we need to withdraw, our friend throws two grenades on the move and retreats here.&#x201D; Sergeant Vadym &#x201C;Malyi,&#x201D; 26, is no stranger to teaching the bare bones of infantry tactics to new recruits. &#x201C;Now, in order to storm you, the scum needs to get out of the trenches,&#x201D; he continues. &#x201C;This area, 20 meters, is out in the open. What does it give us? A chance to kill this guy.&#x201D; Ex-prisoner soldiers of the 1st Separate Assault Battalion &quot;Da Vinci&quot; at a base in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 12, 2023. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Ex-prisoner soldiers of the 1st Separate Assault Battalion &quot;Da Vinci&quot; at a base in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 12, 2023. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Vadym&#x2019;s students, wearing the most basic standard issue pixel camouflage, are no ordinary Ukrainian infantrymen: just a few months earlier, they were all behind bars, serving out sentences in the country&#x2019;s prison system. These men make up the 5th Assault Company of Ukraine&#x2019;s 1st Separate Assault Battalion, named after its late commander Dmytro Kotsiubailo, better known as &#x201C;Da Vinci.&#x201D; A year and a half after Russia first began filling out its ranks with former convicts, Ukraine, beset by chronic manpower shortages and struggling to draft enough soldiers through recruiting and mobilization, finally turned to its own prison population when parliament passed the respective law allowing them to serve in May. Unlike among the general civilian population, the recruitment of prisoners is done on a volunteer basis only, and even then, those serving time for serious crimes such as rape, multiple murders, or crimes against the security of Ukraine are barred from signing up. According to Ukrainian authorities, by the end of July, around 3,800 former prisoners had been recruited and spread among the Armed Forces&#x2019; existing fighting formations in special units like this. &#xA0; Scenes from the daily life of ex-prisoner Ukrainian soldiers in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 12, 2023. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)The Kyiv Independent spent a day with the company &#x2014; already the second such unit in the Da Vinci battalion &#x2014; as it prepared for its first combat missions in southern Donetsk Oblast, just as Russian forces further ramped up offensive efforts in the area. &#x201C;People mobilized nowadays often do not know where they are going, and not many have a desire to continue service here and really defend their home,&#x201D; Vadym said. &#x201C;So when these people came to us, those who were sentenced, it was a flow of new energy; they are really motivated, they still want to destroy the scum and defend their country.&#x201D; As the lecture concludes, the prisoners are let go for a lunch break before a planned training session on the firing range. Lunch here looks very different from that which the ex-convicts would have eaten in prison, often called the &#x201C;zone&#x201D; in post-Soviet prison slang. It&#x2019;s not even about the food, which the men cook themselves, but about the circumstances of relative freedom in which they live in general. Lodging up in village houses not too far from the contact line, there is little that now distinguishes the company from other soldiers living in the village.

(Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)&#x201C;As they took us from the zone to the base, in an ordinary bus, I was in awe,&#x201D; said Oleksii &#x201C;Blondie,&#x201D; 25, as he helped himself to a bowl of instant noodles and cured pig fat. &#x201C;After five years in jail &#x2014; I had been so young when they put me away &#x2014; I was free.&#x201D; Oleksii sports a light blond buzzcut, and, like many in the company, had been serving time for robbery: a seven-year sentence at age 20. &#x201C;I&apos;m an orphan, I have no parents, only a grandmother. I&apos;ve never sat on anyone&apos;s lap, I tried to buy everything I wanted for myself,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;And where would I get the money? By stealing.&#x201D; Although they haven&#x2019;t fought yet as a unit here, many of the men already got a very brief glimpse of combat experience in short stints in Ukraine&#x2019;s 152nd or 153rd mechanized brigades, which had initially recruited them from prison before they were transferred to the Da Vinci battalion. Oleksii, an ex-prisoner soldier of the 1st Separate Assault Battalion &quot;Da Vinci&quot; at a base in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 12, 2023. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Oleksii only saw a couple of combat missions, both in Kharkiv Oblast, in the first months of Russia&#x2019;s repeat offensive there. Now, he looks forward to the end of the war, to a chance to begin a different life, one in which he is not stigmatized by society as a simple criminal. &#x201C;Look, I&apos;ve been in prison for five years,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I wanted to be released not as a convict, but to come home as a hero. Not to be released and come home as the same piece of s*** that arrived.&#x201D; Further down the village road is the house &#x2014; or rather, car &#x2014; now home to Volodymyr, who goes by the callsign &#x201C;Champion.&#x201D; Still shirtless upon first meeting, Volodymyr sports two tattoos of eight-pointed stars near his shoulders, a symbol of authority in prison.

(Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Speaking to the Kyiv Independent with a focused, thoughtful temperament, Volodymyr recalls how the full-scale war gave him a new drive to turn his life around. &#x201C;At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, I wrote a statement to the President to beg for forgiveness,&#x201D; he recalled. &#x201C;There are a lot of people in the zone who really want to defend the country and wrote statements from the first day to release them.&#x201D; Two years passed with no reply, but in 2024 the decision was finally made, out of necessity dictated by the bleak manpower shortage on the battlefield. &#x201C;We are different in size from the country of the aggressor,&#x201D; said Vadym, &#x201C;that&apos;s why we need to protect everyone and make it possible to benefit the country.&#x201D; &#x201C;But also to benefit even those people who have been sentenced. They can spend their lives with the deeds accomplished and their dignified time here in the army.&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes, I was imprisoned in my homeland. But it&apos;s my fault. I have to change my attitude towards other people,&#x201D; said Volodymyr. &#x201C;To be honest, I don&apos;t consider myself a hero. But I have to change something. To change myself.&#x201D; Smoke rises from a sunflower field near a training ground in Donetsk Oblast, on Sept. 12, 2024. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Shaking old habitsAs the men wrap up their lunch and prepare to head to the training ground, a commotion begins outside one of the houses. Disobeying strict rules against the consumption of alcohol for the ex-convict soldiers, one of them is caught with a bottle of spirits, not for the first time. Calling the rest of the company over to the yard for a chat, Vadym decides to make an example of this case, sending the man to solitary confinement in a cellar. As sincere as the motivations of many of the ex-convicts might be, discipline is still a major issue in companies like this. These final days before their first combat missions are crucial. To survive on the battlefield, Vadym says, they will need not only to train hard, but more importantly, to step away from prison culture and mindset, defined by the slang word &#x201C;poniattia&#x201D; (&#x201C;concepts&#x201D;). Ex-prisoner soldiers of the 1st Separate Assault Battalion &quot;Da Vinci&quot; at a base in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 12, 2023. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Once the whole company forms a circle in the yard, the sergeant begins his speech. &#x201C;We have a general problem,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;we have people who still live with their concepts that you had in the zone.&#x201D; &#x201C;Understand, those concepts must stay there. Here we are like children. We have just been born, and now we will show ourselves.&#x201D; The prisoners listen, mostly in silence, though some interject with mumbles of approval. &#x201C;There are plenty of issues with discipline, about how they orient themselves; many just do not understand where they are yet,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;some really wanted to defend their country, but some just wanted to leave the zone.&#x201D; A former theater worker in Kyiv, 47-year-old Oleh &#x201C;Udav,&#x201D; also serving time for robbery, never got used to the internal laws and concepts of prison life. When army recruiters came to his prison, he saw a chance to escape that world and begin a difficult journey back to normal life, where his wife and daughter were waiting. &#x201C;I still don&#x2019;t feel free, because I&#x2019;m not at home,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I haven&#x2019;t seen my parents, my daughter.&#x201D; Oleh, &quot;Udav,&quot; an ex-prisoner soldier of the 1st Separate Assault Battalion &quot;Da Vinci&quot; at a base in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 12, 2023. (Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)Now, although prison culture is still all around him in the unit, Oleh is focused on the great unknown ahead of him: battle. &#x201C;I watch a lot of videos on YouTube,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;I watch how the trenches are stormed, and how to work in an urban area. I watch everything about the fighting.&#x201D; &#x201C;Psychologically, I prepare myself for it. But I am not worried, I&apos;m not afraid of death. I&apos;m a sane person. I want to live. I want to see tomorrow.&#x201D; In the yard, Vadym&#x2019;s speech continues. &#x201C;We could already get the order now that tomorrow five people need to head to the position, and that&#x2019;s it, off you go,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;And then again, you will say, &#x2018;we are not ready, we are this and that,&#x2019; because we spent our time on these domestic issues, these explanations I have to give you now. &#x201D; &#x201C;Out there, they will f*** us, when here, among us, we could have solved these issues.&#x201D; The last gasp of autumn heat sun bears down on the burnt grass of the training range outside the village. &#x201C;Forward! Shift left!&#x201D; Vadym&#x2019;s commands ring out as five men carry out squad-level movement drills on the hillside before moving on to live fire. Awkward in their movement and sometimes slow to remember the basic drills, the ex-convicts still look a little ragtag in action, but they run hard and pay close attention to the head sergeant&#x2019;s corrections. In the following days, after refining their moving and firing as a group, they will move on to orientation drills with a compass, before mastering Kropyva, the Ukrainian battlefield mapping software.

(Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)In between drills, Vadym continues to speak to his new recruits. &#x201C;In our army, no one thinks about the fighters. A fighter is a unit. For some, it is a valuable unit,&#x201D; he says, &#x201D;It is a rarity. They will keep them, impart knowledge, teach them to survive.&#x201D; &#x201C;But for someone else, they will be just a unit, which they will send wherever. In this battalion, we do not do this.&#x201D; In these words lies an issue at the heart of whether these men will live to see freedom and amnesty when hostilities end: their treatment by command. When Russia&#x2019;s Wagner mercenary group first started recruiting tens of thousands of prisoners into its ranks, they were famously used as the most expendable of assault troops: walking slowly forward in small groups towards Ukrainian lines, forbidden to retreat with threats of execution, and rarely surviving beyond their first combat mission.

(Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)As far removed as the Ukrainian command is from the style of Wagner, the similar issue of prisoners&#x2019; lives being treated with less value can still rear its head: when commanders are given control of a prisoner unit, they are more likely to give them the most dangerous missions to protect the others. &#x201C;It&apos;s not like we have some separate operations for them and for civilians who came from home,&#x201D; Vadym said to the Kyiv Independent, &#x201C;No, we all have the same operations.&#x201D; &#x201C;We are all here in equal conditions.

(Francis Farrell/The Kyiv Independent)In a war defined by a heavily armed, deadly attritional struggle, the prisoners will need all the help they can get to make it to the end of the war in one piece.

South Korea could 'review' ban on supply of lethal arms to Ukraine, President Yoon Suk Yeol says	South Korea could review its ban on supplying lethal arms to Ukraine in light of &quot;North Korean military activities,&quot; President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Oct. 24. &quot;If North Korea dispatches special forces to the Ukraine war, we will provide support to Ukraine step by step and consider taking necessary measures for the security of the Korean Peninsula,&quot; Yoon said in a joint press conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda in Seoul. &quot;We have adhered to a principle of not directly supplying lethal weapons, but we can review this more flexibly depending on North Korean military activities,&quot; he added. South Korean law prohibits the exporting of weapons to active conflict zones, but Seoul has repeatedly hinted that this could change in light of deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. Both Yoon and Duda denounced the dispatch of North Korean troops to Russia, describing it as a &quot;direct violation of the U.N. Charter and U.N. Security Council resolutions,&quot; in comments reported by South Korea&apos;s Yonhap news agency. &quot;(South Korea) will never sit idle over this and take necessary measures step by step in coordination with the international community depending on the development of N. Korea-Russia military cooperation,&quot; Yoon added. So far, Seoul has only provided humanitarian and non-lethal military aid to Kyiv, but has been indirectly supplying Ukraine with ammunition, in particular 155mm artillery shells, via the U.S. However, experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent earlier this week said South Korea is unlikely to begin supplying weapons directly anytime soon, as Seoul is restricted by its own legislation. &quot;It&apos;s been a consistent stance because it is law. It&apos;s not just a policy choice,&quot; Jenny Town, senior fellow at the Stimson Center and director of Stimson&apos;s Korea Program and 38 North, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The president can&apos;t just say, &apos;Hey, I&apos;ve changed my mind; here&apos;s what we&apos;re going to do now,&apos; it really does require actual legislation to be passed.&quot; Yoon&apos;s approval rating this week dropped to 24.1 percent, the lowest level since he took office in 2022. Town said he lacks the bipartisan support required to pass legislation because he is in &quot;such a weak position right now.&quot; &quot;If there was going to be greater military assistance to Ukraine, it&apos;s more likely to be by increasing indirect channels,&quot; Town adds. The U.S. publicly confirmed for the first time on Oct. 23 that it had evidence that North Korean troops were in Russia, with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin saying it &quot;remains to be seen&quot; if they would join the fighting. Two North Korean brigades of up to 6,000 personnel each are currently undergoing training in Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 22.	https://kyivindependent.com/south-korea-could-review-ban-on-supply-of-lethal-arms-to-ukraine-president-yoon-suk-yeol-says/	2024-10-24T06:45:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1615679495.jpg
Cargo plane shot down in Sudan with suspected Russian crew may have been supplying weapons, Reuters reports	A cargo plane shot down in Sudan earlier this week may have had a Russian crew and was supplying weapons and ammunition to the country&apos;s army, Reuters reported on Oct. 24, citing sources and documents from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Sudan&apos;s paramilitary RSF claimed to have shot down a cargo plane in Darfur on Oct. 21, with speculation at the time that Russian nationals may have been on board. The aircraft was identified as an Il-74 transport plane that was used to supply weapons, ammunition and provisions to the city of Al Fashir in Sudan, where the Sudanese army is trying to repel RSF&apos;s attacks, an RSF source told Reuters. It is not yet known what route the plane was taking and under what circumstances it was shot down. It had just made a delivery when hit, according to Reuters&apos; source. The crew may have included 67-year-old Russian Viktor Granov, who allegedly had ties to Russian infamous arms dealer Viktor Bout who was released in a prisoner swap between Russia and the U.S. in 2022. Previously, Granov reportedly ran two airlines that were accused of violating the arms embargo in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Remnants of documents found at the scene also suggest 33-year-old Russian Anton Selivanets was also on board the downed plane, Reuters wrote, citing footage shared by the RSF. The RSF also sent the news agency a video they said came from a mobile phone recovered from the plane. Reuters identified one of the men in the footage as a 61-year-old Russian Alexander Kabanov, who posted the same video to his social media accounts over a year ago. According to Kabanov&apos;s accounts, he served in the elite airborne troops and spent several years in Africa, including Uganda, Sudan and South Sudan. Reuters could not confirm who the phone belonged to.	https://kyivindependent.com/cargo-plane-shot-down-in-sudan-with-russians-on-board-may-have-been-used-to-supply-weapons-reuters-reports/	2024-10-24T06:21:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1451403418.jpg

Ukrainian military considering creation of new cyber army branch	Ukrainian military, lawmakers, and experts discussed the creation of a separate branch of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces dedicated to cyberspace operations, the General Staff said on Oct. 24. &quot;The creation of Cyber Forces as a separate branch will significantly enhance the capabilities of the Ukrainian army, ensure effective planning and implementation of the full range of tasks in cyberspace, which, along with land, sea, air and space, is recognized as a separate operational domain,&quot; the statement read. The participants of the meeting reviewed the main provisions of a draft concept of the branch, and defined the main functions and tasks of any future cyber army. They also examined the experience of Western cyber forces, and analyzed the relevant experience of the Ukrainian army during Russia&apos;s all-out war. At the beginning of the Russian full-scale invasion, Ukraine launched an IT army, which was joined by thousands of specialists in the first days of February 2022. It has reportedly carried out multiple cyberattack on Russian online websites.Russian hackers have also regularly targeted various Ukrainian government institutions as well as businesses with crippling cyberattacks aimed at disrupting numerous industries and government services.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-considering/	2024-10-24T05:10:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2116861031.jpg
China 'not aware' of North Korean troops in Russia preparing to fight in Ukraine	China on Oct. 24 said it was &quot;not aware&quot; of any North Korean troops inside Russia preparing to join Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Beijing&apos;s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian made the statement despite the U.S., Seoul and Kyiv all confirming their presence in recent days. When asked at a daily news briefing if China had seen evidence of North Korean troops inside Russia, Jin said &quot;the Chinese side is not aware of the situation.&quot; &quot;China&apos;s position on the Ukrainian crisis has been consistent and clear, and we hope all parties will promote a de-escalation of the situation and commit themselves to a political solution,&quot; the spokesperson added, in comments reported by Reuters. On Oct. 23, the U.S. made its first public confirmation that it had evidence of Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers being sent to Russia, following previous reports from Ukraine and South Korea. Later that day, U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby North Korean troops deployed to fight for Russia against Ukraine are &quot;fair game.&quot; &quot;If they do deploy to fight against Ukraine, they&apos;re fair game, they&apos;re fair targets, and the Ukrainian military will defend themselves against North Korean soldiers the same way they&apos;re defending themselves against Russian soldiers,&quot; Kirby told a press briefing at the White House. Two North Korean brigades of up to 6,000 personnel each are currently undergoing training in Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 22. According to military intelligence, some North Korean officers are already in the occupied territories of Ukraine, he said on Oct. 17. North Korea has denied the reports, while a Kremlin spokesperson gave an evasive answer on the issue. A military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 21 that Russian authorities detained 18 North Korean soldiers who abandoned their positions in Kursk Oblast. Video footage has also circulated purporting to show North Korean troops at a Russian military training camp. South Korean media reported on Oct. 22 that Pyongyang has dispatched pilots who can fly Russian warplanes to join the war in Ukraine. South Korea&apos;s Yonhap agency also said that South Korea is considering sending personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/china-not-aware-of-north-korean-troops-in-russia-preparing-to-fight-in-ukraine/	2024-10-24T04:23:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157665737.jpg
US should consider 'direct military action' if North Korean troops enter Ukraine, Intel Committee Chair says	The U.S. should &quot;seriously consider taking direct military action against&#x2026; North Korean troops&quot; if they enter Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, U.S. Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Michael R. Turner said. In an Oct. 23 statement, Turner, a Republican party representative in the U.S. House of Representatives, called on the administration of President Joe Biden, a Democrat, to &quot;make clear&quot; that Pyongyang joining Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion would be a &quot;red line for the United States.&quot; Earlier in the day, the U.S. publicly confirmed for the first time that it had evidence that North Korean troops were in Russia, with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin saying it &quot;remains to be seen&quot; if they would join the fighting. Two North Korean brigades of up to 6,000 personnel each are currently undergoing training in Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 22. &quot;Now that Secretary Austin has finally acknowledged that North Korean troops are in Russia preparing to enter the conflict with Ukraine, the Biden-Harris Administration must make clear that North Korean troops entering this conflict are a red line for the United States,&quot; Turner said. &quot;If North Korean troops were to invade Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereign territory, the United States needs to seriously consider taking direct military action against the North Korean troops.&quot; The comments from Turner are the strongest by far from a U.S. politician on the matter and come less than two weeks before Kamala Harris, Biden&#x2019;s vice president, is to square off for the presidency in an election where she faces Donald Trump from the Republican party. Trump, who seeks a return to the presidency, has expressed fondness for Russian President Vladimir Putin and questions future U.S. military assistance for Ukraine while insisting he can broker a swift peace agreement. And while rhetoric between Democrats and Republicans is escalating ahead of the hotly contested vote, Turner has been a consistent supporter of Ukraine during Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. In February, he was part of a bipartisan delegation that visited Kyiv to express solidarity with Ukraine as a military aid bill remained tied up in Congress due to political infighting. On Oct. 23, the White House said North Korean troops deployed to fight for Russia against Ukraine are &quot;fair game.&quot; &quot;If they do deploy to fight against Ukraine, they&apos;re fair game, they&apos;re fair targets, and the Ukrainian military will defend themselves against North Korean soldiers the same way they&apos;re defending themselves against Russian soldiers,&quot; U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told a press briefing at the White House. &quot;And so the possibility that there could be dead and wounded North Korean soldiers&#x2026; is absolutely real if they get deployed.&quot; Kirby also revealed details of U.S. intelligence assessments, saying Washington believes North Korea &quot;moved at least 3,000 soldiers into eastern Russia.&quot; &quot;We assess that these soldiers traveled by ship from the Wan area in North Korea to Vladivostok, Russia,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;These soldiers then traveled onward to multiple Russian military training sites in eastern Russia where they are currently undergoing training.&quot; Kirby said it was too early to say for sure if they &quot;will enter into combat alongside the Russian military,&quot; but added it was a &quot;highly concerning probability.&quot; &quot;We have briefed the Ukrainian government on our understanding of this situation, and we&apos;re certainly consulting closely with other allies, partners and countries in the region on the implications of such a dramatic move, and on how we might respond,&quot; Kirby said. &quot;I expect to have more to share on all of that in the coming days,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-should-consider-direct-military-action-if-north-korean-troops-enter-ukraine-intel-committee-chair-says/	2024-10-24T03:45:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-492165484.jpg

4 Ukrainian POWs killed by Russian forces near Selydove, Prosecutor General's Office reports	Russian soldiers killed four captured Ukrainian servicemen near the town of Selydove in Donetsk Oblast, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office reported on Oct. 24. In a post on Telegram, it said the four members of Ukraine&apos;s National Guard were fighting near the town when they were taken prisoner during a Russian attack on Oct. 6. Russian soldiers filmed their interrogations, but when the positions were recaptured by Ukrainian forces on Oct. 7, their bodies were discovered. The Prosecutor General&apos;s Office has opened a pre-trial investigation into the incident. There have been multiple reports of the executions of Ukrainian POWs by Russian soldiers during the full-scale invasion, but they have increased dramatically over the last year. Videos and photos have documented potential war crimes, including drone footage showing the shooting of the POWs as they surrendered to Russian troops. Other videos and photos point to torture and violent death in Russian captivity. As of Oct. 18, Russian forces have executed at least 102 Ukrainian prisoners of war since 2022, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said. Andrii Kostin, the former Prosecutor General, said that the executions of Ukrainian POWs were not isolated incidents, but a purposeful policy&quot; of Russia, citing the audio recordings obtained by Kyiv.Selydove, a town located 18 kilometers (11 miles) south of Pokrovsk, has become a focal point of Russia&apos;s offensive in recent weeks.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-killed-4-ukrainian-pows-near-selydove-prosecutors-say/	2024-10-24T01:24:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2168107336.jpg
Lukashenko dismisses North Korean troop reports, says it would 'escalate' Russia's war in Ukraine	The involvement of North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine would be &quot;a step towards escalation,&quot; Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko said in an interview with the BBC published on Oct. 23. Speaking on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Kazan, Lukashenko dismissed reports that North Korea had sent its soldiers to aid Russia&apos;s war effort, describing them as &quot;rubbish.&quot; &quot;Knowing his character (Russian President Vladimir) Putin would never try to persuade another country to involve its army in Russia&#x2019;s special operation in Ukraine,&quot; he said. &quot;It would be a step towards the escalation of the conflict if the armed forces of any country, even Belarus, were on the contact line.&quot; According to Lukashenko, the West could respond to such a move by deploying NATO troops in Ukraine. &quot;Even if we got involved in the war this would be a path to escalation. Why? Because you, the Anglo-Saxons, would immediately say that another country had got involved on one side... so Nato troops would be deployed to Ukraine.&quot; While Belarus, an ally of Russia, hasn&apos;t directly participated in the war, it has allowed the Kremlin to use its territory as a staging ground for its operations against Ukraine. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR), said that the first North Korean units were expected to arrive in Kursk Oblast on Oct. 23. Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory there. Earlier in October, Budanov said that the first group would consist of 2,600 soldiers. Pentagon Chief Lloyd Austin confirmed on Oct. 23 that North Korean soldiers are in Russia without elaborating on their numbers and tasks. Two North Korean brigades of up to 6,000 personnel each are currently undergoing training in Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

At least 7 countries resisting Ukraine's NATO membership invitation, Politico reports	Seven NATO countries are reluctant to grant Ukraine an invitation to join NATO, Politico reported on Oct. 23, citing four anonymous U.S. and NATO officials and diplomats. While Germany and the U.S. are already known to have reservations about the move, the outlet reported that Belgium, Slovenia, and Spain are &quot;hiding behind&quot; those two countries, and slow-walking President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s ongoing request. In mid-October, Zelensky unveiled his five-point victory plan, which includes Kyiv&apos;s invitation to join NATO placed at the top of the list. U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said on Oct. 17 that the alliance does not currently have such plans. &quot;Countries like Belgium, Slovenia or Spain are hiding behind the U.S. and Germany. They are reluctant,&quot; one of the NATO officials told Politico. The nations &quot;support it in the abstract, but once it gets closer to materializing&quot; they will start to oppose the idea more publicly, they added. Two other countries &#x2014; Hungary and Slovakia &#x2014; are not backing Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership due to their pro-Kremlin leanings, Politico reported. Zelensky said earlier this week that Germany has softened its stance on Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership, but remains &quot;skeptical.&quot; &quot;But still, the U.S. will have an impact on this... We believe that they are consolidating their thoughts on NATO and this has an impact on, for example, Hungary and Slovakia,&quot; he said at a meeting with journalists, attended by the Kyiv Independent. Kyiv submitted its application to join in September 2022, and in July 2024 the alliance affirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership&quot; &#x2014; though Ukraine has not received any definitive news about its future accession. According to the information obtained by the Kyiv Independent, Kyiv had planned to ask for NATO membership within the months, not years.	https://kyivindependent.com/at-least-7-countries-resist/	2024-10-23T23:26:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2161663204.jpg

Moscow court sentences Ukrainian-born film producer to 8 and a half years in absentia for reporting on Russian war crimes	Moscow&apos;s Basmanny district court sentenced Ukrainian film producer Alexander Rodnyansky, on Oct. 21, to 8 and a half years in absentia for &quot;spreading fake information&quot; about the Russian Army. Rodnyansky worked in Russia for decades, and fled after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion started in 2022. The 63-year-old Oscar-nominated producer was accused of reporting on the shelling of a maternity hospital in Mariupol and other attacks on civilian infrastructure throughout the war. Rodnyansky stated that the case stemmed from his &quot;anti-war posts on Instagram,&quot; expressing strong disagreement with the verdict. &quot;No Basmanny court can stop me from speaking loudly,&quot; he said on Telegram. &#x201C;The prosecutor said in her speech that my posts &#x2018;expressed a negative attitude towards the Russian military by characterizing their activities as invasive.&#x2019; And I agree with the prosecutor. And so does the rest of the world. Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine is invasive and despicable.&#x201D; Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s crackdown on dissent since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine has seen thousands of his citizens arrested and many jailed.

Germany's Finance Minister suggests revising legal status and benefits for Ukrainian refugees	Germany&apos;s Finance Minister Christian Lindner has proposed reevaluating the legal status of Ukrainian refugees, German magazine Wirtschaftswoche reported on Oct. 23. In an interview with the outlet, Lindner suggested lowering welfare costs and increasing employment among those receiving benefits. Lindner said that Ukrainians should not qualify by default for the higher Burgergeld payments, which are typically for residents and cover social and economic needs, even for those not employed. Instead, he recommended offering benefits more aligned with asylum seekers, combined with labor market integration tools. &quot;They should not automatically receive Burgergeld,&quot; Lindner said. The topic of benefits for Ukrainian refugees has recently caused debate among German officials. More than 200,000 Ukrainian refugees have already found jobs in Germany through the government&apos;s Jobturbo program, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said during a conference with citizens and voters of his Social Democratic Party (SPD) in Teltow. Germany has taken in more than 1 million refugees from Ukraine since February 2022. Berlin has spent more than 20 billion euros ($21.4 billion) on accommodation and integration of refugees, according to Bloomberg. According to Eurostat, over 4.2 million Ukrainian refugees are currently registered for temporary protection to legally access housing, find work, and receive social benefits in EU states. The EU activated the Temporary Protection Directive in March 2022 after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began.	https://kyivindependent.com/germanys-finance-minister-suggests-revising-legal-status-and-benefits-for-ukrainian-refugees/	2024-10-23T19:25:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-200515448-001.jpg
Ukraine risks delay in receiving $4.3 billion instalment from EU's Ukraine Facility due to reform shortcomings, Foreign Ministry says	Deputy Foreign Minister Yevhen Perebyinis issued a letter to cabinet ministers on Oct. 23 warning that the European Union has notified Ukraine that the next tranche of 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) from the EU&apos;s Ukraine Facility may be delayed until next year unless expected aspects of corruption reforms are completed by the end of this month. &quot;The EU stated that if Ukraine does not finish all internal procedures to approve and adopt the law by the end of October 2024, the 4 billion euros financing will be re-allocated for the following year,&quot; Perebyinis wrote in the letter. The initial payment, scheduled to be dispersed in November, risks delay amid stalled progress on improving regulations for plea agreements in corruption cases. The necessary changes to Ukraine&apos;s Criminal Code were supposed to have been finished by the third quarter of 2024, however, they were only approved by parliament in the first reading on Oct. 9. It was not immediately clear as to when the payment would be postponed until if Ukraine&apos;s parliament fails to fully adopt the new changes. Following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, the European Union created a list of reforms Ukraine must implement as a necessary step toward Kyiv&apos;s accession into the alliance. Last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a bill reforming the State Customs Service and introduced to tackle corruption and save funds otherwise lost to smuggling, with a myriad of other reforms ongoing. The Ukraine Facility, approved by the EU in February, allocates 33 billion euros ($36 billion) in loans and 17 billion euros ($18 billion) in grants to Kyiv. The EU Council approved the framework agreement in mid-May, setting out the Ukrainian government&apos;s tasks for recovery, reconstruction, and modernization.The besieged country received $42.5 billion in external financing from various donors last year, allowing it to function amid the ongoing war. The International Monetary Fund said Ukraine will need roughly the same sum to support its budget this year. According to Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko, the current pledges are still not sufficient to cover the country&apos;s needs, adding that Ukraine will likely need an additional $12-15 billion in foreign financial support next year.	https://kyivindependent.com/mfa-ukraine-risks/	2024-10-23T15:36:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1785291162.jpg
Controversial chief of staff for Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces dismissed months after appointment, Ukrainska Pravda reports	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Roman Hladkyi, the controversial Chief of Staff of the Unmanned Systems Forces (USF), was dismissed from his position just months after being appointed to the post in August 2024, Ukrainska Pravda reported on Oct. 23, citing Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry. Hladyki was appointed Chief of Staff of USF on Aug. 30 after being dismissed from his position as the Chief of Staff of the Navy due to a scandal in April 2018. The Navy&apos;s press service stated that Hladkyi&apos;s dismissal was due to &quot;shortcomings in official activities following an inspection of a military unit by Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry.&quot; &quot;As a result of an investigation conducted by the Security Service of Ukraine, it was determined that Roman Hladkyi&apos;s continued tenure as Chief of Staff of the Unmanned Systems Forces of Ukraine was untenable,&quot; the Defense Ministry told Ukrainska Pravda in a statement following his most recent dismissal. &quot;This decision was made following all necessary procedures and thorough checks, with the aim of enhancing the unit&apos;s effectiveness and its ability to meet modern challenges,&quot; the statement added. According to the statement, the decision was made on Oct. 14 and Hladyki has since been transferred to a reserve battalion. No additional details were immediately available on Hladkyi&apos;s dismissal. Following his appointment to the post in August, Ukrainian lawmakers criticized the appointment. Mariana Bezuhla, formerly a member of President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Servant of the People party, questioned how Hladkyi, a native of Crimea and a Navy captain with a questionable reputation, passed the Security Service vetting process and was appointed to such a high position. Bezuhla also alleged that Hladkyi is &quot;a suspect in high treason, espionage, and corruption,&quot; though law enforcement agencies had not officially confirmed this.Prior to his first dismissal in 2018, Ukrainian media also reported allegations that Hladkyi&apos;s wife held Russian citizenship and lived in Russian-occupied Crimea, and that his daughter participated in swimming competitions for the Central Sports Club of the Russian Army. In 2018, the Defense Ministry denied that information about Hladkyi&apos;s family members was the basis for an internal investigation. Colonel Oleksii Halabuda, the former commander of the 28th Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces was appointed to replace Hladkyi, the Defense Ministry said. During Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, both Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, transforming modern warfare. For the outnumbered Ukrainian forces, drones have become crucial in targeting Russian warships, naval bases, oil refineries, and airfields inside occupied territories and deep behind enemy lines.Ukraine officially established its Unmanned Systems Forces on June 11, four months after President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a decree to create a separate branch of the armed forces dedicated to enhancing drone operations.	https://kyivindependent.com/successor-chosen-for-controversial-chief-of-staff-of-the-unmanned-systems-forces-ukrainska-pravda-says/	2024-10-23T13:48:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2151793922.jpg
Belarus schedules next presidential election for January 2025	Belarus has scheduled its next presidential election for January 26, 2025, the country&#x2019;s Central Electoral Commission announced on Oct. 23. Incumbent Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko is widely expected to hold on to power following the election&apos;s result. Lukashenko, the country&apos;s leader since 1994 and Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s closest ally, has long been accused of staging fraudulent elections in Belarus. In 2020, during the last presidential election, Lukashenko maintained power despite the country&apos;s most prominent opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, receiving popular support &#x2014; claiming she won with 60 per cent of the vote. Following the fabricated results, mass protest erupted in Minsk but were ultimately quelled with the support of Russia. According to the Belarusian human rights group Viasna, over 50,000 citizens have been detained for political reasons since the 2020 election. Following the announcement of the election date, Tsikhanouskaya disavowed the process calling it a &quot;sham with no real electoral process, conducted in an atmosphere of terror.&quot; &quot;No alternative candidates or observers will be allowed. We call on Belarusians and the international community to reject this farce,&quot; Tsikhanouskaya added. Following the 2020 election results, the European Union imposed sanctions on Belarus for &quot;repression and intimidation against peaceful demonstrators, opposition members and journalists.&quot; Earlier this year on Aug. 9, the U.K. imposed new sanctions against four Belarusian individuals and three entities on the fourth anniversary of the 2020 presidential election in Belarus. Despite not being directly involved in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Belarus hosts Russian troops and missiles on its territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-schedules-next-presidential-election-for-january-2025/	2024-10-23T13:04:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1798852424.jpg
Ukraine war latest: US confirms North Korean troops in Russia; Zelensky preparing plan to withstand war	Key developments on Oct. 23: President Volodymyr Zelensky tasked the Ukrainian authorities to develop proposals for an internal action plan to help the country withstand the war, a source close to the President&apos;s Office told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 23. According to the source, the document will address military, political, economic, and other areas, including certain decisions regarding law enforcement. The plan is expected to be prepared and presented to the Ukrainian public by the end of 2024, BBC Ukraine reported earlier in the day, citing unnamed government sources. The Kyiv Independent&apos;s source said that it may take several more weeks to develop the document. &quot;The goal is to do everything possible to maintain unity and achieve results in various areas of the country&apos;s development,&quot; a source in Zelensky&apos;s team told BBC. The plan reportedly is not an alternative to Zelensky&apos;s victory plan and provides for steps to be taken by Ukraine itself. Zelensky publicly unveiled his five-point victory plan on Oct. 16, which includes Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO placed atop the list. The victory plan also includes a defense aspect, non-nuclear deterrence of Russian aggression, economic growth and cooperation, and post-war security architecture. It is also comprised of three classified addenda that have been shared with international partners. Ukraine&apos;s president said that a victory plan &quot;can bridge the gap between the current situation and the successful peace summit.&quot; There is evidence that North Korean troops are in Russia, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in Rome on Oct. 23, Reuters reported. Austin&apos;s comment comes as the first public confirmation by the U.S. of previous statements by Ukraine and South Korea. The two nations say Russia is planning to involve thousands of North Korean troops in its full-scale war. &quot;There is evidence that there are DPRK (North Korean) troops in Russia. What exactly they are doing? Left to be seen. These are things that we need to sort out,&quot; the Pentagon chief said. Austin did not specify the number of North Korean troops that had arrived in Russia. Nearly 3,000 soldiers had been sent to support the Kremlin&apos;s war in Ukraine, and &quot;thousands more&quot; were expected to follow, Reuters reported, citing South Korean intelligence. &quot;Signs of troops being trained inside North Korea were detected in September and October,&quot; Park Sun-won, a member of a parliamentary intelligence committee, said. &quot;It appears that the troops have now been dispersed to multiple training facilities in Russia and are adapting to the local environment.&quot; Pyongyang had promised to provide a total of about 10,000 troops, whose deployment was expected to be completed by December, according to South Korean military intelligence. North Korea has denied the reports, while a Kremlin spokesperson gave an evasive answer on the issue. A military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 21 that Russian authorities detained 18 North Korean soldiers who abandoned their positions in Kursk Oblast. Video footage has also circulated purporting to show North Korean troops at a Russian military training camp. South Korean media reported on Oct. 22 that Pyongyang has dispatched pilots who can fly Russian warplanes to join the war in Ukraine. South Korea&apos;s Yonhap agency also said that South Korea is considering sending personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops. Ukraine managed to stabilize the situation in Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast, but the Russian army continues to concentrate its forces in the eastern part of the town, Anastasiia Bobovnikova, a spokesperson of the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, said on Oct. 23 on national television. Toretsk lies some 35 kilometers (20 miles) north of occupied Donetsk. The town became one of the hottest spots in Donetsk Oblast in recent months as Russian troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. &quot;The situation in Toretsk has relatively stabilized. We (Ukrainian forces) are now holding the demarcation line unchanged. The enemy is still entrenched in the city&apos;s eastern parts,&quot; Bobovnikova said. &quot;However, we are holding back their further advance and will defend the town as long as possible. And we are doing a good job of it now.&quot; The number of assaults on this front line&apos;s sector has slightly decreased, which may indicate that Russian troops have taken a tactical pause to possibly replenish manpower, accumulate weapons, and redeploy equipment, Bobovnikova added. According to local authorities, Kyiv controlled roughly 40-50% of the town as of Oct. 11, while Russia had captured the rest. Previously, the Ukrainian military said that fights were taking place &quot;at every building entrance&quot; as Russian forces were pushing from the east along the main Tsentralna (Central) Street. The loss of Toretsk would be another blow to Ukraine in Donetsk Oblast after its forces were forced to withdraw from Vuhledar in the south. Russian forces also continue pushing toward Kurakhove and Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub roughly 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Toretsk. London will donate an additional 120 million pounds ($155 million) to the Maritime Capability Coalition to support Ukraine&apos;s Navy, the U.K. government announced on Oct. 22. The move comes as a response to Russia stepping up attacks against port infrastructure in southern Odesa Oblast that resulted in damaged civilian ships and casualties. &quot;Russia&apos;s indiscriminate strikes on ports in the Black Sea underscore that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is willing to gamble on global food security in his attempts to force Ukraine into submission,&quot; U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said. The British government accused Russia of threatening global food security, including humanitarian supplies to war-stricken Palestine, just as some Global South leaders gather in the Russian city of Kazan for the BRICS summit. The U.K. is looking for partners to co-finance the supply of &quot;hundreds&quot; more naval drones as well as surveillance radars to protect Ukraine&apos;s grain corridor. London and Oslo are also seeking a further 100 million pounds ($129 million) to co-fund hundreds more. As part of the naval coalition, Ukraine has received dozens of amphibious all-terrain vehicles and raiding boats, hundreds of anti-ship missiles, and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition, according to the statement. Over the past three months, Russia has carried out nearly 60 attacks on Ukrainian ports, damaging or destroying nearly 300 port infrastructure facilities and 22 civilian vessels, Oleksii Kuleba, the minister for the development of communities, territories, and infrastructure, said on Oct. 10. Over 80 civilians were killed or injured as a result of these strikes. France will deliver its first three Mirage 2000-5s fighter jets to Ukraine in the first quarter of 2025, the French newspaper La Tribune reported on Oct. 23, citing its sources. Paris previously confirmed it would begin transferring its aircraft in the first three months of next year but did not comment on the numbers. The timing of delivery takes into account the time needed to train pilots and mechanics and prepare the aircraft, La Tribune wrote. According to the outlet, the planes will be equipped with ground strike capabilities, namely SCALP/Storm Shadow long-range missiles and French guided bombs AASM Hammer. France and the U.K. have previously supplied Kyiv with SCALP and Storm Shadow missiles that have a range of up to 250 kilometers (150 miles) and have been successfully deployed against Russian military targets in Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The French Defense Ministry refused to comment for La Tribune. The Mirage 2000 is a multirole aircraft designed in the late 1970s and introduced in 1984. The 2000-5 version has upgraded radar systems and can carry fuel drop tanks, greatly increasing its range. French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans for their delivery to Ukraine in June, saying that France would also provide training to Ukrainian pilots and staff. He did not reveal how many aircraft France plans to send in total. The Mirage 2000-5 is a fourth-generation fighter jet, meaning it is in the same class as the U.S.-made F-16 that Ukraine&apos;s Air Force already operates. Denmark and the Netherlands were the first countries to deliver their F-16s, making them the first Western fighter jets in Ukraine&apos;s arsenal. While Kyiv awaits Mirages and additional F-16s, it is also in talks to acquire Swedish-made Saab JAS 39 Gripen and the Eurofighter Typhoon fighters.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-zelensky-preparing-action-plan-for-ukraine-to-withstand-war-source-says/	2024-10-23T12:59:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178138302.jpg
Finishing off the defenseless: How the Russians execute Ukrainian soldiers	Warning: This article contains graphic photos and descriptions of graphic scenes. A decomposed human hand with the remains of flesh, bleak and brown save for one splash of color &#x2014; two thin blue-yellow rubber bracelets. The colors of the Ukrainian national flag. The hand was from a body of the hundreds of victims of Russian troops, soldiers, and civilians, exhumed from a mass burial site near the then-just-liberated Izium, a city in Kharkiv Oblast, in September 2022. Captured by journalists, the photo spread worldwide and became a symbol of Russian violence and Ukrainian resistance. Many assumed that the man, soon identified as a Ukrainian soldier Serhii Sova, was killed in battle. Only one person knew that the truth was more grim. Months earlier, Sova&#x2019;s widow saw the photos of her dead husband on Russian Telegram channels. The photos showed he had been shot in the head, his hands tied behind his back. All signs pointed to the fact that he had been executed while in Russian captivity. Still, when his body was found near Izium, it hit her again. A hand of Ukrainian soldier Serhii Sova photographed after his body was found at a mass burial site near Izium, Kharkiv Oblast, after the area&apos;s liberation from Russian forces in September 2022. (Provided by the author)&#x201C;My heart and everything inside me sank,&#x201D; Oksana Sova says, recalling the moment she saw the photos in the media and recognized the bracelet and tattoos on her husband&#x2019;s body. This story is one vivid example of a recently increasing number of public reports of executions of Ukrainian soldiers by Russian forces. According to Ukraine&#x2019;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office, cases of executions of Ukraine&#x2019;s soldiers began to surge in 2023. Videos and photos of brutal executions have been appearing online more frequently since the spring of 2023. In March 2023, a video was published on Telegram showing Russian soldiers shooting a captive Ukrainian soldier after he said &quot;Glory to Ukraine.&quot; Only a month later, a different video showed Russian soldiers cutting off the head of a Ukrainian soldier as he screamed in pain. At the end of the video, a Russian soldier holds up the severed head. Cases like this continue to surface in 2024, often accompanied by horrendous videos. Some of them feature decapitation and mutilation of bodies. Prisoners of war (POW) are granted protection under international humanitarian law, namely the 4th Hague Convention on the Laws and Customs of War adopted in 1907. According to the convention, killing a POW constitutes a war crime, and a soldier is considered a POW and cannot be attacked from the moment he lays down his weapon or no longer possesses the means of protection, voluntarily surrenders, or demonstrates such an intention. This also applies to those who find themselves under the power of the enemy, rendered defenseless by unconsciousness, injury, or illness. It&#x2019;s impossible to know how many Ukrainian soldiers have been executed after being taken captive. Recording and investigating such crimes is extremely difficult due to limited access. Since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, the United Nations has documented the execution of 42 Ukrainian service members. Ukraine has documented 102 such executions as of October 2022. The actual figure could be much higher. Even for the cases that have been recorded, justice appears to be a doubtful prospect. Russia doesn&#x2019;t recognize or investigate POW execution cases. In Ukraine, the Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office has opened 27 investigations into the killing of POWs. So far, only three cases have made it to court, only one of which is being considered in the presence of a Russian soldier and two in absentia. No verdicts have been made yet. The Kyiv Independent has collected testimonies about three executions of Ukrainian soldiers by Russian troops. We received photo evidence of the crimes, which the Russian soldiers themselves distributed on Telegram channels shortly after the execution, a unique video shot from a drone by Ukrainian military officers, and spoke with an eyewitness to an execution who was captured, survived abuse in captivity, and returned to Ukraine. These are their stories. On June 1, 2022, in Donetsk Oblast, near the village of Yarova, at dawn, Russian artillery fired intensely in preparation for an assault on Ukrainian positions. Next, the tanks rolled in. Roman Zarudny, callsign &#x201C;Irishman,&#x201D; a soldier from the National Guard of Ukraine, was at the outpost that was among the first to be attacked. A 32-year-old former circus artist who voluntarily joined the military at the beginning of the full-scale invasion, he had been fighting for less than three months at the time of the assault. As he remembers the attacks, Ukrainian soldiers didn&#x2019;t stand a chance. &quot;We should have pulled back because we had nothing to fight with,&#x201D; he recalls. &#x201C;I managed to fire one magazine, then there was smoke, a grenade, a bang &#x2014; and that was the end of my war.&quot; Zarudny was in the dugout with two other infantrymen. One told his comrades he was wounded. &quot;He said, &apos;Guys, I think I&#x2019;m 300&#x2019;,&#x201D; he recalled his comrade saying, using the military code for &#x201C;wounded.&#x201D; &#x201C;We checked, cut off his clothes, and saw his knee and elbow were shot.&quot; The Russian fire subsided as their infantry fighting vehicles moved deeper into the village. The soldiers removed the wounded soldier&apos;s body armor, bandaged him, and considered their next move. It was too late to retreat. &quot;I had already said goodbye to life at that point,&quot; said Zarudny. The Russian troops were approaching the dugout. Zarudny said he didn&#x2019;t want to get captured and recalled one of his comrades echoing him. Zarudny took a hand grenade. &#x201C;I thought &#x2014; if they get in, I could take a few of them with me,&#x201D; recalled Zarudny. Videos and photos of brutal executions of Ukrainian soldiers have been surfacing online with increasing frequency since spring 2023. (Karolina Gulshani / The Kyiv Independent)But after a brief discussion, they decided to surrender. Zarudny recalls that a Russian soldier saw the grenade in his hand, warned him not to use it, and took it away. Then, the Russian soldiers noticed the wounded soldier. &quot;A Russian soldier looked at him, cocked his Kalashnikov, and fired two shots at him,&#x201D; Zarudny recalled. &#x201C;Then, he said: &apos;Don&apos;t take it the wrong way. His legs were shattered. I did it so he wouldn&apos;t suffer. He&#x2019;s better off this way&#x2019;.&quot; The Russian soldiers took the other two soldiers as prisoners. Zarudny was released in a prisoner exchange a year and a half later, in January 2024. The second soldier is still officially listed as a prisoner. As for the third one, he is formally listed as missing. What happened to his body is unknown, and his family is still searching for him, hoping for the best. Soldiers from the Kulchytsky Battalion, who fought alongside Zarudny&#x2019;s brigade on June 1, 2022, confirmed the dramatic turn of events that day, unfavorable for Ukrainian forces. It is one of the most widely recognized photos of Russia&#x2019;s invasion. In September 2022, after the liberation of Kharkiv Oblast, a large burial site was found in the forest near the city of Izium &#x2014; the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, killed by Russians. Soon after, Ukrainian authorities began their exhumation. One of the bodies exhumed drew the attention of the media on site: Its half-decomposed wrist carried a rubber bracelet in the colors of the Ukrainian national flag. The photo flew around the world. Oksana Sova from Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, recognized her husband, 35-year-old serviceman Serhii Sova, in the photographs. By that time, he had been officially listed as missing for almost five months, since April 19, 2022. When the body was found in September, Oksana already knew her husband was dead. Workers exhume a body at a mass burial site containing around 440 graves in liberated Izium, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine on Sept. 16, 2022. (Kostyantyn Chernichkin / The Kyiv Independent)Oksana has never shared the story of how she found out what happened to her husband until now. Nor has she discussed what she experienced in the days since she learned that he had gone missing. &quot;Every single day, I was checking Russian Telegram channels, looking for prisoners, the dead, everyone,&#x201D; she recalls. &#x201C;After a month, in May, I found what I was looking for.&#x201D; Scrolling through Telegram channels, Oksana came upon familiar features. In the photo, her husband was stripped down to the waist, his hands tied behind his back. In the back of his head, a gaping gunshot wound. The nature of the photo, the absence of clothes, the tied hands &#x2014; all pointed to the fact that Russian soldiers had killed Serhii when he was already captured and should have been protected as a POW. &#x201C;It was a photo taken after his execution,&#x201D; Oksana says. &#x201C;In the photo, he was very thin &#x2014; my husband was never that thin. I kept looking... It was tough in the first days. I noticed that these bastards had taken everything. There were no silver chains with the pendants I had given him, no belt, no boots.&quot; There could be no mistake in identifying him: The photo showed the soldier&apos;s face and recognizable tattoos on his torso &#x2014; an owl, a samurai, and a sakura. Near Serhii was at least one more dead man, his hands tied behind his back and a t-shirt pulled over his head. The photographs documenting this war crime were later deleted from the Russian Telegram channels, which they had posted along with other photos of captured and executed Ukrainian soldiers with a call urging Ukrainians to surrender in order to survive. Oksana also later deleted the photos from her phone, fearing that her two children would accidentally find them. However, friends of Serhii saved screenshots of the posts and shared them with the Kyiv Independent. The circumstances of the battle during which Serhii was captured are recounted by his comrades, who managed to retreat in time. In April 2022, the 3rd Company of the 1st Battalion of the 93rd Brigade was holding positions in tree lines near the villages of Sulyhivka, Dibrivne, and Nova Dmytrivka in the Izium district of Kharkiv Oblast. This location is about 50 kilometers from where Serhii&#x2019;s body would be found in September. &quot;We held the defense there for about two weeks and tried to break through. On April 19, at 2 a.m., we received the order to retreat because we were being encircled. We moved back to another tree line,&#x201D; recalls Yurii, callsign &quot;Pavuk,&quot; who was at that time a squad commander of the 3rd Company, 3rd Platoon, 1st Battalion of the 93rd Brigade. He remembers how the company was repositioning from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m., when Russian troops saw it and brazenly advanced. Artillery was hitting them from all sides, causing them to scatter before the enemy tanks arrived. Serhii&#x2019;s position was about 100 meters from Yurii, closer to the road. &#x201C;The Russians drove in there with tanks and armored personnel carriers and started destroying everything in sight,&#x201D; he says, adding that he knows of only two men who were taken captive that day. &#x201C;Everyone else who was there died. There were about 40 people. This all happened in about four hours.&quot; Thanks to photographic evidence, which the Russians published on Telegram channels, it became clear that Serhii survived that heavy battle and even remained unharmed, but was executed by Russian soldiers. According to the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s sources in Serhii&#x2019;s unit, the 93rd Brigade, the Russian troops that were stationed in the area were from the 4th Tank Kantemirovskaya Division. For Oksana, establishing the truth about what really happened to her loved one and remembering him in a dignified way is vital. Oksana and Serhii had been together for 17 years. They ran a dog training business together. He was a boxer and had served in the Ukrainian army before. He left behind two children: a son, Marat, now 16, and a daughter, Elina, who is 11. &quot;Seventeen years of our life together. These were the best years of my life, and I am very grateful he was my husband. He loved us very much; we were everything to him, and he spent all his free time with the family.&quot; Oksana and Serhii Sova were together for 17 years, running a dog-training business. After joining the Ukrainian Armed Forces in 2022, Serhii was executed by Russian troops in Kharkiv Oblast. (Oksana Sova&apos;s archive)Oksana and Serhii Sova with their two children: 16-year-old Marat and 11-year-old Elina. (Oksana Sova&apos;s archive)Many testimonies of executions of prisoners on the battlefield in this war have been captured by aerial footage. The Kyiv Independent obtained a video, according to our sources inside the brigade, dated Feb. 18, 2024, shot in the trenches between the villages of Robotyne and Verbove in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. It shows two unarmed soldiers of the 82nd Separate Air Assault Brigade walking near the trenches before being shot by an automatic firearm moments later. &quot;During the battle, the Russians killed two of our guys. Two more survived. When the Russians entered, our guys raised their hands, but the Russians killed them,&quot; said one of the eyewitnesses who saw what happened that day during a live broadcast from a drone. Executions on a battlefield remain among the least documented deaths in war. This crime extremely rarely leaves witnesses. Units of such cases fall into the lenses of drones or are recorded by the killers. &quot;This has been practiced in the Russian army since the (Second) Chechen War. And they did it very much in many conflicts in which they participated. I think that this is a specially organized practice, and it is aimed at two aspects,&quot; says Volodymyr Yavorskyi, program director of the Ukrainian Nobel Prize-winning Center for Civil Liberties. He believes that it&#x2019;s all about spreading fear: firstly among people already on the front lines that they will most certainly die, so they should retreat. Secondly, among those who are expected to be mobilized. &quot;A person sees this and thinks that mobilization is inevitable death,&#x201D; he said. As practice shows, taking or not taking a prisoner in battle depends on various factors, said a 47-year-old major of Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces, who we identify only by his callsign &quot;Karay&quot; because he has no official permission to comment on the issue. &#x201C;Karay&#x201D; has witnessed many acts of cruelty during his 10-year service in the war in Ukraine in various brigades. &#xA0; 0:00/1&#xD7;The video shot by a Ukrainian drone shows Ukrainian soldiers moments before their execution by Russian soldiers between the villages of Robotyne and Verbove, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, in February 2024. (Screenshot from a video)&quot;Prisoners can be executed because of the desire to take revenge for fellow servants, or when a group cannot or does not want to spend time on guarding and evacuating prisoners, so they kill them.&#x201D; At the same time, the higher the status of the unit, like Russian marines or paratroopers, the higher the probability that the prisoners will remain alive, &#x201C;Karay&#x201D; said. &#x201C;There is a higher percentage of professional soldiers. For them, war is work, and they avoid emotions.&#x201D; On the other hand, there are some Russian units, such as the &#x201C;Rusich&#x201D; Sabotage-Assault Reconnaissance Group,&#x201D; which publicly declares that they do not take prisoners. They were the ones who published the video featuring the cutting off of the head of a Ukrainian soldier. &quot;In some units, according to radio intercepts, Russian commanders practice involving their soldiers in executions, including with demonstrative brutality, to bind the &quot;team&quot; with blood and crimes so that the soldiers will fight to the last and not surrender to the Ukrainians,&#x201D; &#x201C;Karay&#x201D; said.	https://kyivindependent.com/finishing-off-the-defenseless-how-the-russians-execute-ukrainian-soldiers/	2024-10-23T12:28:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Iryna_POW_Story_3_Smaller.jpg
US to provide $20 billion loan to Ukraine as part of G7 pledge	The U.S. will allocate $20 billion to Ukraine as part of a $50-billion pledge by the Group of Seven (G7), President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Oct. 23 in his evening address. During the June G7 summit in Italy, G7 leaders publicly confirmed the plan to provide Ukraine with a $50 billion loan by the end of the year which will be repaid using interest from billions in frozen Russian assets. &quot;This is what will really support us. And it is important to implement it this year, &quot; Zelensky said, thanking the U.S. and the entire G7. Daleep Singh, the White House deputy national security adviser on international economics, said that Joe Biden&apos;s administration intends to split the funds between helping the Ukrainian economy and the military, according to the Associated Press (AP). &quot;To be clear, nothing like this has ever been done before,&quot; Singh said. &quot;Never before has a multilateral coalition frozen the assets of an aggressor country and then harnessed the value of those assets to fund the defense of the aggrieved party, all while respecting the rule of law and maintaining solidarity.&quot; Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that the funds from Western partners under this initiative will meet Ukraine&apos;s most important financial needs in 2025. &quot;Thanks to this assistance, our allies are creating a solid foundation for Ukraine&apos;s economic and financial stability,&quot; Shmyhal said. The bulk of the G7&apos;s $50 billion loan was supposed to be equally covered by the EU and the U.S., with each economic powerhouse shouldering $20 billion. Japan, the U.K., and Canada would jointly provide the remaining $10 billion. That plan stood on shaky ground as the U.S. was reluctant to commit unless the EU extended the sanctions immobilizing Russian assets. Such a step requires an unanimous vote, which is currently being blocked by Hungary, the EU&apos;s most Kremlin-friendly member. As Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban threatened to use his veto power in Brussels, the U.S. signaled it might still participate in the loan, albeit for a reduced amount, of around $5 billion, equating to the Russian assets held domestically.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-provide-20-billion-loan-to-ukraine-as-part-of-g7-pledge/	2024-10-23T12:19:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2147967390.jpg
UK prepares another group of future Ukrainian F-16 pilots, bringing total number of trainees to 200	Another group of Ukrainian military personnel completed elementary flying training for F-16 fighter jets in the U.K., the British Royal Air Force (RAF) reported on Oct. 22. British instructors have trained a total of 200 Ukrainian pilots so far, according to British Under-Secretary of State for the Armed Forces Luke Pollard. The U.K. and other allies have been training Ukrainian pilots on F-16s at an accelerated pace due to Kyiv&apos;s urgent need for air defense against intensifying Russian bombardments. &quot;The next step is advanced fast jet training and conversion to F-16 with partner nations,&quot; the RAF&apos;s statement read. Pollard and Ukraine&apos;s Ambassador to the U.K. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, former commander-in-chief, attended the graduation ceremony. Zaluzhnyi thanked the U.K. government for its continued support, which &quot;gives (Ukraine) a chance to win.&quot; The first group of Ukrainian pilots graduated from a full training course in the U.S. in May, and Denmark prepared 50 Ukrainian F-16 maintenance specialists in June. Yet, only 11 F-16 pilots are currently flying in Ukraine, though a full squadron consists of 40. Ukraine received its first U.S.-made fourth-generation jets in late July, one year after Denmark, the Netherlands, and other foreign partners launched a fighter jet coalition for Kyiv. The pace of the training program came into question after a recently delivered F-16 operated by Ukraine&apos;s top pilot, Oleksii Mes, crashed while defending against a Russian drone and missile attack on Aug. 26. Mes, call sign &quot;Moonfish,&quot; was killed in the crash.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-prepares-another-group-of-future-ukrainian-f-16-pilots-bringing-total-number-of-trainees-to-200/	2024-10-23T11:31:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Gagzx7pWgAAagZ8.jpeg
Why South Korean weapons are unlikely to be heading directly to Ukraine anytime soon	South Korea has hinted it could change its long-standing stance on not providing Ukraine directly with weapons in light of the dramatic escalation of North Korea&apos;s role in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. So far, Seoul has only provided humanitarian and non-lethal military aid to Kyiv, but on Oct. 22, a South Korean government source suggested this could change, and the direct supply of arms was being considered. Earlier, on Oct. 18, South Korea said that Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers being sent to Russia was a &quot;grave security threat&quot; and warned that it would &quot;respond by mobilizing all available means in cooperation with the international community.&quot; However, experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent say South Korea&apos;s position is unlikely to change soon, as Seoul is restricted by its own legislation. &quot;There&apos;s always a bit of posturing that happens in the immediate aftermath of what North Korea is doing, but the actual ability to implement this is very difficult, &quot;Jenny Town, senior fellow at the Stimson Center and director of Stimson&apos;s Korea Program and 38 North, told the Kyiv Independent. South Korean law prohibits the exporting of weapons to active conflict zones. In June, Seoul said it would reconsider this in relation to Ukraine after Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un signed a security agreement in Pyongyang. Publicly, nothing came of this statement, but the recent news of North Korean troops being sent to Russia has raised the issue once again. Citing a South Korean government source, the Yonhap agency reported on Oct. 22 that Seoul is considering sending a team of personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops. It also said the government is reportedly considering providing Ukraine with armed support. &quot;While watching signs of North Korea-Russia military cooperation, the response measures will be taken in steps,&quot; the source told Yonhap. But the source said that sending defensive weapons will be prioritized over lethal arms, adding that even if lethal weapons are provided, South Korea will first consider providing them to Kyiv indirectly.

(Anthony Wallace / AFP via Getty Images)Town said that despite Seoul&apos;s words, supplying Ukraine directly with weaponry isn&apos;t even an option currently. &quot;It&apos;s been a consistent stance because it is law. It&apos;s not just a policy choice,&quot; she said, adding: &quot;The president can&apos;t just say, &apos;Hey, I&apos;ve changed my mind; here&apos;s what we&apos;re going to do now,&apos; it really does require actual legislation to be passed.&quot; And currently, that seems very unlikely. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol&apos;s approval rating this week dropped to 24.1 percent, the lowest level since he took office in 2022. Town said he lacks the bipartisan support required to pass legislation because he is in &quot;such a weak position right now.&quot; &quot;If there was going to be greater military assistance to Ukraine, it&apos;s more likely to be by increasing indirect channels,&quot; Town adds. South Korea has a thriving arms industry. And while much of this is fueled by the domestic need to defend against its ever-belligerent northern neighbor, it&apos;s also one of the world&apos;s biggest exporters of weapons. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, South Korea currently ranks 10th in terms of arms exports. In particular, South Korea has a lot of 155mm artillery shells, which Ukraine desperately needs. &quot;In terms of what South Korea could provide directly, the biggest medium-term impact would be ammunition because basically the West is tapped out,&quot; Vann Van Diepen, a consultant and former U.S. State Department official, told the Kyiv Independent. According to Ukrainian officials, just holding the front lines requires 75,000 a month, while fending off another major Russian offensive could double this number. Meanwhile, Russia is firing around 300,000 a month, with North Korea reportedly supplying half of the sum. South Korea has long been under some pressure from Ukraine&apos;s Western allies to send 155mm shells to Ukraine to help fight off Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. But restricted by its laws, Seoul had to devise a workaround to contribute. It has done this by indirectly supplying Ukraine with ammunition, in particular 155mm artillery shells, via the U.S. The U.S. sends Ukraine shells from its stockpiles, and South Korea sends the U.S. replacements. But the U.S. and European nations have struggled to ramp up production to the rates required to fuel the biggest land war in Europe since World War II, meaning the limiting factor isn&apos;t how many South Korea can send but how many other countries can produce. Van Diepen said that while South Korea produces a range of weapons that would be on Ukraine&apos;s wishlist, there are difficulties and challenges with supplying them, even indirectly. South Korea produces the K9 Thunder self-propelled 155 mm howitzer, though this would require another arrangement with a third country, and there is currently no talk of this. The same applies to the K239 multiple launch rocket system (MLRS), considered to be at least on a par with the U.S.-made HIMARS system, which was a game-changer for Ukraine when they first arrived in the summer of 2022, allowing Kyiv to target Russian forces in occupied territories far more accurately than they had previously.

Ukraine&apos;s Western partners continue to refuse to authorize deep strikes in Russia with long-range missiles such as ATACMS and Storm Shadows. &quot;South Korea would likely have the same concerns the U.S. has in terms of escalating things, they&apos;ll be looking over one shoulder in terms of their future relationship with Russia,&quot; Van Diepen said, adding: &quot;There are probably lines that they won&apos;t want to cross.&quot; &quot;So ammunition and artillery would be the most likely.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/why-south-korean-weapons-are-unlikely-to-be-heading-directly-to-ukraine-anytime-soon/	2024-10-23T11:14:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175191224.jpg
Russia's wartime economy delivers growth, but will the bubble burst?	A recent draft budget submitted to the Russian parliament last month has outlined the Kremlin&apos;s plans to keep spending high in its wartime economy, with ambitions to maintain the steady levels of growth the country has seen since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Surging government spending on war and defense production prompted the International Monetary Fund on Oct. 22 to increase its 2024 growth forecast for Russia to 3.6%. The three-year budget, which plans to further hike military spending to post-Soviet record highs, shows Moscow&apos;s commitment to a long-war. But analysts warn that increased inflation and an ever-worsening labor shortage could see the tide turn on Russia&apos;s sanction-ridden economy. &quot;What we have seen in the past two years is that you can achieve relatively high growth with enormous fiscal support. The problem is you are simply mortgaging your future,&quot; Alexander Kolyandr, a financial analyst and non-resident scholar at the Center for European Policy Analysis, told the Kyiv Independent. After rounds of Western sanctions sent shockwaves through the Russian economy following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, plunging the ruble by over 30% and driving up consumer costs by almost a fifth across the country, the Russian Central Bank introduced tight capital controls, swiftly moving the economy onto a planned wartime footing and allowing the Kremlin to spend its way out of a brief period of recession. &quot;Russia was simply in an extremely resilient position when the full-scale invasion began,&quot; said Janis Kluge, an expert on Russia&apos;s economy with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.&quot; Combined with record revenues that oil and gas brought following the start of the all-out war, this windfall payment provided a safety net for the economy, giving Moscow the ability to increase its spending in certain industries which in turn led to growth in GDP, Kluge added. The draft budget has outlined Moscow&apos;s ambitions to keep those levels of spending high in order to keep its wartime economy afloat. The planned total budget expenditure in 2025 will increase to 41.5 trillion rubles, up roughly 13% from 2024&apos;s 36.6 trillion. Of that sum, almost 41% will be spent on defense and security, outweighing the government&apos;s combined expenditure on education, healthcare, social policy and the national economy. This sum not only highlights Moscow&apos;s readiness to continue its war of aggression with its Westerly neighbor, but also hints at the Kremlin&apos;s awareness that it could take decades to reconstitute its armed forces after nearly 3 years of costly fighting, Dara Massicot, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told the Kyiv Independent. Though rather than that extra spending being funded by increased oil revenues, at times an almost sole driver of economic growth throughout the presidency of Vladimir Putin, the budget proposals make conservative estimates on oil and gas yields, expecting them to fall to 10.9 trillion roubles in 2025 down from 11.3 trillion roubles expected this year.

(Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty Images)&quot;We are now trying to minimize the impact of oil prices on the budget. The overall share of cash receipts from the sale of oil and gas in the treasury&apos;s income is decreasing. If a few years ago this figure was 35-40%, then in 2025 it should decrease to 27%, and in 2027 &#x2013; to 23%,&quot; Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told the state broadcaster RT Arabic last week. But weaning the economy off its dependence on oil and gas revenues could take years, with the financial system still remaining highly vulnerable in the event of a sudden decrease in the oil and gas price, Kluge said. &quot;If the oil price were to go down, let&apos;s say to below $50 per barrel, this would already have a significant effect on the Russian economy. It would lead to a strong devaluation of the ruble, which in turn would cause more inflation in Russia,&quot; he added. Inflation in Russia has remained high throughout 2024, with the annual figure slowing to 8.63% in August, down slightly from 9.05% in August. To combat these pressures, Russia&apos;s Central Bank has kept interest rates high, now set at an unprecedented 19%. According to the prospective budget, much of the cash to fuel that extra spending will come from taxpayers, with hikes in both income and corporation taxes. A gamble that the Kremlin can currently afford to take after two years of overheating in the economy has led to a spike in living standards as well as record-low unemployment, Kolyandr said. &quot;Wherever you look, you see that people get more money, and they are now able to borrow more because yesterday you were a low-paid non-entity, and today you are a proud worker for a tank production facility,&quot; Kolyandr said. In order to fuel its war, the Kremlin has been pumping money into its defense industry, offering thousands of new jobs at inflated salaries. According to President Putin, 520,000 new jobs have opened in the industry in the last 18 months, with social welfare payments for the birth of children and favorable mortgage rates offered to those who take up work in the sector. But even paying three or four times the average salary for the region, the push for more workers continues to run up against a critical shortage of labor across Russia, something analysts warn could beset the country&apos;s economy for years to come. Figures show that Russia&apos;s unemployment rate has fallen approximately 2% since its invasion of Ukraine, reaching record lows of 2.4% in June this year, according to the Federal State Statistics Service (RosStat). With hundreds of thousands of men having been sent to war, and a further 650,000 people fleeing the country since February 2022, according to an investigation by The Bell, the country&apos;s decreased workforce and renewed anti-migrant rhetoric means there are few places left for the Kremlin to find more workers. Anti-migrant campaigns have been steadily growing across Russia since 2021, said Alexander Verkhovsky, the head of the Moscow-based Sova Center, which monitors extremism in Russia. The war in Ukraine, as well as a number of terrorist attacks in the past year, including at a concert hall in Moscow in March that left 145 dead, have only further fuelled this sentiment, he added.

(Stringer/AFP/Getty Images)Russian President Vladimir Putin reacts during the Summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in Moscow, Russia on Oct. 8, 2024. (Contributor/Getty Images)&quot;The regime is changing, which opens up more possibilities for Russian nationalists,&quot; Verkhovsky told the Kyiv Independent, &quot;because the regime needs more support from below due to the war, it has to give (those groups) more freedom of actions,&quot; he added. The Russian State Duma is on course to adopt five more laws before December which will further toughen up legislation against migrants, a likely response to the will of the population, Kolyandr said, but only making the problem of labor shortages more acute. &quot;In some ideal world, they would love to import more people to join the labor force from abroad. But given the overall attitude in Russia towards non-white, non-Christian migrants, that would be a problem,&quot; Kolyandr said. The Kremlin has instead outlined its intention for the economy to adapt to new, lower levels of unemployment whilst increasing its levels of productivity. This is unlikely to be able to overcome its shortage of workers, though, given the wide range of technological sanctions making it difficult for Russia to get its hands on the much-needed high-tech machinery, Kluge said. &quot;The cost of labor for companies is increasing a lot. For example, some retailers are trying to do more with things like digital cashiers. But at the same time, there are limits to this because of sanctions, because Russia is not able to acquire many of the machines that you would need to replace humans in production,&quot; he said. All of this makes the long-term economic outlet potentially pretty grim for the Kremlin, analysts said, though much of that will depend on external factors such as the geopolitical situation and the global oil price. What is clear, though, is that eventually, Russia will arrive at a point that pumping money into its economy will no longer be able to yield the returns it has over the last two and half years of war, Kolyandr said. &quot;Due to constraints in the economy, eventually you cannot invest in more production, you cannot hire more people. At a certain point, you increase your fiscal spending, but it doesn&apos;t lead to high economic growth,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s like binge drinking. At some point, you drink another glass of wine, and it doesn&apos;t make you happier. It just increases your hangover the next day.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/spend-spend-spend-russia-sets-out-budget-plans-but-how-long-before-wartime-bubble-bursts/	2024-10-23T10:54:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157219700.jpg
Ukraine has stabilized situation in Toretsk, but Russia is concentrating troops in town's east, military says	Ukraine managed to stabilize the situation in Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast, but the Russian army continues to concentrate its forces in the eastern part of the town, Anastasiia Bobovnikova, a spokesperson of the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, said on Oct. 23 on national television. Toretsk lies some 35 kilometers (20 miles) north of occupied Donetsk. The town has become one of the hottest spots in Donetsk Oblast in recent months as Russian troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. &quot;The situation in Toretsk has relatively stabilized. We (Ukrainian forces) are now holding the demarcation line unchanged. The enemy is still entrenched in the city&apos;s eastern parts,&quot; Bobovnikova said. &quot;However, we are holding back their further advance and will defend the town as long as possible. And we are doing a good job of it now.&quot; The number of assaults on this front line&apos;s sector has slightly decreased, which may indicate that Russian troops have taken a tactical pause to possibly replenish manpower, accumulate weapons, and redeploy equipment, Bobovnikova added. According to local authorities, Kyiv controlled roughly 40-50% of the town as of Oct. 11, while Russia had captured the rest. Previously, the Ukrainian military said that fights were taking place &quot;at every building entrance&quot; as Russian forces were pushing from the east along the main Tsentralna (Central) Street. The loss of Toretsk would be another blow to Ukraine in Donetsk Oblast after its forces were forced to withdraw from Vuhledar in the south. Russian forces also continue pushing toward Kurakhove and Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub roughly 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Toretsk.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-has-stabilized-situation-in-toretsk-but-russia-is-concentrating-troops-in-towns-east-ukrainian-military-says/	2024-10-23T10:16:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2162608242.jpg
About 3,000 North Korean troops were sent to Russia to participate in war against Ukraine, South Korean intelligence says	Nearly 3,000 soldiers had been sent to support the Kremlin&apos;s war in Ukraine, and &quot;thousands more&quot;were expected to follow, Reuters reported on Oct. 23, citing South Korean intelligence. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence has reported that Moscow is planning to involve Pyongyang in the full-scale war against Ukraine in the coming months, with around 10,000 North Korean soldiers preparing to join the Russian army. &quot;Signs of troops being trained inside North Korea were detected in September and October,&quot; Park Sun-won, a member of a parliamentary intelligence committee, said. &quot;It appears that the troops have now been dispersed to multiple training facilities in Russia and are adapting to the local environment.&quot; Pyongyang had promised to provide a total of about 10,000 troops, whose deployment was expected to be completed by December, according to South Korean military intelligence. Two North Korean brigades of up to 6,000 personnel each are currently undergoing training in Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. According to military intelligence, some North Korean officers are already in the occupied territories of Ukraine, he said on Oct. 17. North Korea has denied the reports, while a Kremlin spokesperson gave an evasive answer on the issue. A military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 21 that Russian authorities detained 18 North Korean soldiers who abandoned their positions in Kursk Oblast. Video footage has also circulated purporting to show North Korean troops at a Russian military training camp. South Korean media reported on Oct. 22 that Pyongyang has dispatched pilots who can fly Russian warplanes to join the war in Ukraine. South Korea&apos;s Yonhap agency also said that South Korea is considering sending personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/about-3-000-north-korean-troops-were-sent-to-russia-to-participate-in-war-against-ukraine-south-korean-intelligence-says/	2024-10-23T09:36:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029632286.jpg

Ukraine's 'I Want to Live' project posts Korean-language video message, calls on North Korean soldiers to surrender	The Ukrainian project &quot;I Want to Live&quot; on Oct. 23 called on North Korean soldiers to surrender to Ukrainian forces in a new Korean-language video. Launched in September 2022 by Ukraine&apos;s Main Directorate of Intelligence, the 24-hour &quot;I Want to Live&quot; hotline helps Russian soldiers willingly surrender themselves or their units to the Ukrainian army. The Russian military is promised that after surrender, they will be held in compliance with the Geneva Conventions. &quot;You must not die senselessly in a foreign land. You must not repeat the fate of hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers who will never return home!&quot; the Korean-language statement reads. &quot;No matter how many soldiers Pyongyang sends to help Russia, no matter the destination - Ukrainian POW camps are ready to receive soldiers of any nationality, religion, and ideological views.&quot; In the statement, the North Korean military is guaranteed safe conditions of detention, food, and medical care by the Ukrainian side. John Foreman CBE, the U.K.&apos;s former defense attache in Moscow from 2019 to 2022, told the Kyiv Independent that Ukrainian efforts might help the North Koreans to desert. The North Korean soldiers will also know that the treatment by the Ukrainians will be &quot;much more humane &quot; than treatment by their own side and by the Russians, Foreman added. Foreman assumed that North Korea had probably anticipated this by holding the families of the soldiers, if not hostage, but setting out the consequences of desertion on their families. &quot;(North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un has absolutely no compunction in killing his own people, starving them, assassinating his political opponents, anybody he&#x2019;s seen as disloyal. So, I think that holding that sword of Damocles over the heads of the families of the soldiers of North Korea would be one way of keeping their loyalty,&quot; Foreman said. Russia and North Korea signed a mutual defense pact during Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s visit to Pyongyang in June. As part of the agreement, the North Korean military announced that an engineering unit would join Russian forces on the ground in Donetsk Oblast the following month. The secret clause reportedly allowed North Korea to send the first 1,000 of its soldiers to Ukraine to gain military experience. More North Korean troops are expected to be engaged, the source told the WSJ. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, previously revealed that close to 11,000 North Korean troops are already in Russia and will be ready to fight by Nov. 1.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-i-want-to-live-project-calls-on-north-korean-soldiers-to-surrender/	2024-10-23T08:46:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157772464.jpg
Ukraine denies Russia breached Chasiv Yar defense line following conflicting reports	Russian troops were not able to get a foothold in Ukrainian defense lines in the city of Chasiv Yar in Donetsk Oblast, Andrii Polukhin, a spokesperson of the 24th Mechanized Brigade, said in an interview with Free Radio on Oct. 22. Hours prior, Ivan Petrychak, a representative of the 24th Mechanized Brigade&apos;s press service, said on national television that the Russian military managed to breach the defense, but there were no signs of the city&apos;s potential loss. Russian small infantry groups enter the Ukrainian defense line but cannot exit because they are being blocked by Ukrainian drones, according to Polukhin. &quot;It cannot be called a consolidation or wedging; it is not some kind of movement along the line of defense,&quot; Polukhin said. Petrychak, in turn, described the situation in this front-line sector as &quot;difficult but controlled.&quot; The situation remained tense throughout the last month, and the Russian military made daily attempts to storm the positions of Ukrainian forces, according to Petrychak. He added that Russian troops used an advantage of heavy fog to cross the channel to Chasiv Yar, which is now blocked. The Russian army outnumbers the Ukrainian forces and is constantly trying to break through the Ukrainian defense line, shelling Chasiv Yar with artillery, launching missiles, and conducting bombardments with aircraft, according to Petrychak. The Donetsk Oblast city of Chasiv Yar has been partially under Russian control since Ukrainian forces withdrew from the eastern Kanal neighborhood in July, establishing the Siverskyi Donets &#x2013; Donbas Canal as the new front line. Russian troops set their sights on Chasiv Yar, which is located on a higher ground, after capturing Avdiivka in February. The higher ground could give Russian troops a key strategic advantage in attacks on other towns in Donetsk Oblast. Before the full-scale invasion, Chasiv Yar was home to about 12,000 people. By April 2024, around 700 people remained. In recent months, Russian troops have been conducting a grinding advance in eastern Ukraine, making territorial gains while incurring heavy losses.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-military-denies-russia-getting-into-line-of-ukrainian-defense-in-chasiv-yar/	2024-10-23T07:53:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2151793922.jpg
Opinion: Putin’s drone strategy shows the cracks in Russia’s war machine	Russia shot down one of its own drones &#x2014; a large and stealthy S-70 &#x2014; after it flew uncontrolled into Ukrainian territory in early October, sparking speculation about how Moscow lost control of this valuable asset so publicly. It&#x2019;s an unforced error that will be keenly felt in Moscow, whose high ambitions for producing its own drones have been slow to take flight. Given shortfalls in manpower, munitions, artillery, and aircraft, Russia has signaled its belief that uncrewed systems could be transformative in an attritional war, listing drone production among the Kremlin&#x2019;s priority projects. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also announced plans to increase drone production tenfold in 2024, aiming to manufacture 1.4 million this year. But is this realistic or just more propaganda? Russia will struggle to meet this target and will likely have to rely on China to procure enough drones. To supply this demand, China would need to significantly boost its own production. After its invasion of Georgia in 2008, Russia ramped up investment in unmanned aerial vehicles. Yet drone production was not prioritized, and Russian firms fell short of international competitors like China, the U.S., Israel, and Turkey. The large combat models like the S-70 and smaller, more disposable reconnaissance drones that have been produced suffer from low manufacturing output, reflecting difficulties in moving from prototype to serial production &#x2014; a problem that plagues the Russian defense industry in general. Since the full-scale invasion, Russia has deployed low-cost Chinese quadcopters in vast numbers, while another Russian company, Albatross, has localized production of Iran&#x2019;s Shahed, a loitering munition or &quot;kamikaze&quot; drone. That Russia has leaned so heavily on Chinese and Iranian support highlights the difficulties the Kremlin has faced in meeting surging battlefield demand for new drones due to bottlenecks in domestic production. Despite a glut of new state funding for the military, Russia&#x2019;s defense industry remains hampered by systemic issues, such as poor productivity, low profitability, corruption, aging infrastructure, a shortage of workforce skills, and continued reliance on foreign parts and machine tools amid Western sanctions. Scaling up production and supply chains is not straightforward. Russia&#x2019;s defense industry has repeatedly adapted more quickly and effectively than outsiders expect, leveraging the country&#x2019;s vast reserves, high levels of state influence over strategic enterprises, and illicit networks. Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) examines an Orlan-10 drone at the Special Technology Center in Saint Petersburg, Russia, on Sept. 19, 2024. (Contributor/Getty Images)To meet Putin&#x2019;s ambitious goals, Russian defense managers will have to work along three lines: boosting manufacturing, accelerating the localization of foreign drone technology or paying others to build them, and importing as many drones as possible to fill the gap when domestic output falls short. Increasing productivity is a Kremlin priority but a difficult task. Firms face a tight labor market and must reorient supply chains toward Asia. Many critical technologies and machine tools are now harder to procure. Companies can buy parts from China and other trading partners or tap into a growing &quot;gray trade&quot; of components acquired through third countries. But this introduces quality control issues, especially since illicit supply chains often yield shoddy or counterfeit parts. These barriers make it clear Russia will not achieve its targets using domestic resources alone. Albatross provides a case study of localizing production, as it produces a version of the Shahed at the Alabuga site in Tatarstan with funding from VTB. This illustrates how drone production could be a lucrative opportunity for new companies in the market. In Russia, entrepreneurship is often encouraged during periods of state need, and partnerships with foreign suppliers offer a quick way to take proven designs and sell a locally produced version. Most importantly, to meet its targets, Russia will need to buy a lot of drones. Given Russia&#x2019;s growing dependence on China for parts and components, it seems unlikely the country will have the capacity to produce 1.4 million units domestically in the near future. Instead, Russia may become China&#x2019;s largest drone customer. According to RAND research, global production of drones was estimated at 2.4 million units in 2023, with China holding a 70% share (around 1.68 million units), and its company DJI plays a dominant role. Recent reports indicate that another Chinese company in Shenzhen is producing drones to order for Kupol, a major Russian defense firm. However, China would need to significantly increase production to meet existing demand from elsewhere, further pushing the Kremlin into strategic dependency on Beijing. Putin&#x2019;s formal announcement of a &quot;drone campaign&quot; is significant, but bold new political targets won&#x2019;t sweep aside complex industrial realities. The Kremlin will hope this unlocks financial resources and pressures defense managers to mobilize resources however they can. Still, it&#x2019;s unclear how Russia can achieve such a sharp increase in drone numbers without relying on continued off-the-shelf purchasing, especially from China. This campaign should serve as a signal to Kyiv and its partners that further investment in drone countermeasures is a priority, just as EU and NATO nations must continue to scale up their own drone production in support of Ukraine&#x2019;s defense.

North Korean troops dispatch was secret clause of Moscow-Pyongyang pact, WSJ reports	A strategic partnership agreement between Moscow and Pyongyang contained a secret clause on sending North Korean troops to fight Russia&apos;s full-scale war with Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal reported on Oct. 23, citing an unnamed former Russian intelligence agent familiar with the matter. The two countries signed a mutual defense pact during Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s visit to Pyongyang in June. As part of the agreement, the North Korean military announced that an engineering unit would join Russian forces on the ground in Donetsk Oblast the following month. The secret clause reportedly allowed North Korea to send the first 1,000 of its soldiers to Ukraine to gain military experience. More North Korean troops are expected to be engaged, the source told the WSJ. According to the newspaper, currently, most North Korean soldiers are kept at a safe distance from the front line in Ukraine. They are being shown how the Russian army handles logistics and are gaining a new understanding of drone warfare, the source said. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR), said that the first North Korean units were expected to arrive in Kursk Oblast on Oct. 23. Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory there. Earlier in October, Budanov said that the first group would consist of 2,600 soldiers. Pentagon Chief Lloyd Austin confirmed on Oct. 23 that North Korean soldiers are in Russia without elaborating on their numbers and tasks. Two North Korean brigades of up to 6,000 personnel each are currently undergoing training in Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. According to military intelligence, some North Korean officers are already in the occupied territories of Ukraine, he said on Oct. 17. North Korea has denied the reports, while a Kremlin spokesperson gave an evasive answer on the issue.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-north-korea-troops-wsj/	2024-10-23T06:05:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157679114.jpg
Opinion: Ukraine’s war is the reckoning with empire Europe can no longer avoid	Thirty years ago, in a Ukrainian churchyard where my Russian ancestors are buried, I knelt beside a very old woman leaning on a stick, her hair covered in a black kerchief. Behind us stood the Russian church that my great-grandfather built on his estate and where he lies buried. The old woman was the last villager left who could remember the time when our family lived there. She had been a young girl of six or seven, running up to the kitchen door of the big house, carrying blueberries in her apron, and receiving from my grandfather&#x2019;s sister a spoonful of hot blackberry jam. After that, the Bolshevik Revolution came, my family fled, the church was closed, and Soviet agents from the city eventually confiscated the grain, took away the kulaks, and left everyone to starve. The Holodomor, the famine that Stalin inflicted on Ukraine, reduced people who had farmed the richest soil in Europe to eating grass. Then came the war, when the Nazis set the village thatches alight and massacred the local Jewish population. The old woman sat next to me in the church and told me her story; at the end, she leaned her thin body against mine and began to howl. I have never forgotten the sound. Whenever I hear it again in memory, I understand what the Ukrainian struggle is about. The troops fighting to hold on in Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine, the firemen pulling civilians out of the rubble of bombed buildings in Kharkiv, and the drone pilots targeting Russian ships in the Black Sea are fighting to give themselves and their children a different history than the one that made that old woman howl. This is what we don&#x2019;t seem to understand. The Western European and American public is increasingly disengaged from their struggle. The carnage seems unbelievable &#x2014; is it really possible that a half-million Russians and perhaps nearly as many Ukrainians have been killed or wounded since the full-scale war began in February 2022? For too many, the dying could just as well be happening on another planet, and our politicians&#x2019; insistence that our security depends on a Ukrainian victory sounds abstract, thin, and less than credible. If the Ukrainians are truly fighting for us, it is because they are fighting the last battle against European imperialism. Every other imperial power in Europe has given up its colonies and begun a reckoning with the harm that empire did to its colonial subjects and to its own people. For with empire came the invention of racial hierarchy and racially justified domination, violence, and cruelty. These poisons still affect us, and nostalgia for vanished imperial greatness has been just as damaging. Even in America, which had no empire, but an immensely profitable global hegemony, much of Donald Trump&#x2019;s presidential campaign stokes and exploits this atavistic sentiment, with its call to &#x201C;make America great again.&#x201D; You can&#x2019;t build democracy at home unless you dispense with empire and nostalgia for its loss. Until you do this, your politics will be consumed by deluded dreams. Spanish historians have told me that the final defeat of the Spanish empire with the loss of Cuba and the Philippines at the turn of the twentieth century fostered the authoritarian turn that delivered Spain to Franco and delayed the transition to democracy for two generations. Empire in Africa prevented a democratic transition in Portugal until 1974. Marine Le Pen&#x2019;s right-wing movement in France began with her father&#x2019;s fury at the loss of Algeria and his contempt for the democratic institutions Charles de Gaulle put in place after he withdrew France from North Africa. When societies face up to their past, they create the possibility of a politics based in reality, not fantasy. In Britain, the Labour government of 1945 understood that it could not build democracy at home unless it abandoned India and Palestine. Germany had to be unconditionally defeated before it gave up its fantasy of an imperium across Europe and Asia. Russia remains the one European society that has never honestly faced up to its imperial past. In refusing to acknowledge the legacy of Stalin, in failing to face up to his crimes in Ukraine, in the other &#x201C;captive nations,&#x201D; and in Russia itself, Russia closed off any path to its own democratic future. Its people have laid themselves open to the perpetual tyranny of a man who can only turn their sons into cannon fodder. This is the lethal pathology that Ukraine is fighting in our name. When Ukraine&#x2019;s citizens say they want to join Europe, what they mean is that they want to rip empire out of their souls and live as free people, liberated from a past whose memory made an old woman howl in pain. All imperial nostalgias are best laid to rest, even benign ones like hers and mine for the sweet days of the ancien r&#xE9;gime when my Russian ancestors kept the kitchen door open for peasant girls and gave them dollops of blackberry jam. A free Ukraine will have to make its own peace with the remnants of old Russia, like the churchyard where my ancestors are buried. For now, Ukrainians are pulling Tolstoy off their shelves, and toppling Catherine the Great from her plinth in Odesa. Later, a more complex reckoning will fall due. You have to own all of your history, not just the parts that fit your mythologies. Once Ukrainians have won a peace they can live with, a free Ukraine will have to own the imprint of the Russian past on its soul, and then wrestle free of that past. Only then can it begin to make a new history beyond terror, violence, and fear. Editor&#x2019;s Note: Copyright, Project Syndicate.

3 companies of Russian soldiers killed, injured in assaults on Selydove, National Guard says	Ukraine&apos;s National Guard troops repelled 13 Russian attacks near the town of Selydove in Donetsk Oblast over the past day, killing or injuring around three companies of soldiers, spokesperson Ruslan Muzychuk told Ukrainska Pravda on Oct. 23. Selydove, with a pre-war population of nearly 21,000 people, is located 18 kilometers (11 miles) south of Pokrovsk, which has been a focal point of Russia&apos;s offensive in recent months. Russia is using significant infantry numbers near Selydove, according to the National Guard. A total of 307 Russian soldiers were killed or injured in the area over the past day, Muzychuk said. &quot;This is actually three companies,&quot; he added. The estimated advance of Russian forces near the town of Selydove in Donetsk Oblast as of Oct. 22, 2024, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Ukrainian forces also reportedly destroyed more than 10 pieces of Russian equipment, including a tank and armored vehicles. &quot;In recent weeks, the enemy has significantly increased the presence of electronic warfare equipment, which complicates the work of aerial reconnaissance. &#xA0;But our UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) operators are finding solutions for the effective use of drones,&quot; Muzychuk said. Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in defending the front line, particularly in Donetsk Oblast, where Russia has consistently concentrated its offensive potential. Following Ukraine&apos;s withdrawal from Vuhledar in early October, Russian forces have been focusing their efforts against the Donetsk Oblast towns of Pokrovsk, Toretsk, and Kurakhove, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are slowly losing ground under Russian pressure.	https://kyivindependent.com/around-3-companies-of-russian-soldiers-killed-injured-in-assaults-on-selydove-natinal-guard-says/	2024-10-23T05:43:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2169569108.jpg
Many Russians support Putin despite favoring opposing policies, survey shows	Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to enjoy majority support in his country, even though many of his supporters back steps contradicting the Kremlin&apos;s actual policies, a survey published by Meduza and RFE/RL&apos;s Current Time news outlets on Oct. 22 shows. The Kremlin&apos;s chief has enjoyed consistent support among the Russian population even as Moscow&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine has been ongoing for more than two and half years, previous independent polling revealed. Around 78% of respondents said they continue to support Putin&apos;s activities as president, according to the poll conducted by the independent Levada Center between Sept. 10 and 17. At the same time, 83% of Putin&apos;s supporters said that the government should focus more on domestic social and economic issues, and 61% favored peace in Ukraine under mutual concessions. Some 43% of respondents wanted to restore relations with the West, while 25% supported full mobilization for the war against Ukraine. The Kremlin has avoided instituting a full draft, carrying out only a limited mobilization in September 2022 and replenishing its forces from other sources like volunteers, convicts, migrant workers, or, recently, North Korean soldiers. Of those who did not voice support for Putin, 79% supported a peace agreement with Ukraine with mutual concessions, 90% wanted to restore relations with the West, 92% desired greater government focus on domestic issues, and 13% supported mobilization. Putin has claimed he is always open to negotiations while simultaneously reiterating Moscow&apos;s maximalist goals of &quot;demilitarization&quot; and &quot;de-Nazification&quot; of Ukraine. The Kremlin&apos;s propaganda has falsely accused the Ukrainian leadership of Nazi ideology to justify its full-scale invasion. Ukrainian and Western officials said they do not believe Putin is willing to negotiate in good faith and continues to seek full control over the country. Russia has so far not agreed to participate in Ukraine&apos;s planned second peace summit. In June, Putin demanded Kyiv cede the entire regions of Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Luhansk, and Donetsk, which are under partial Russian occupation, as a precondition for talks. Ukraine has rejected this and insisted any peace talks should be led on the basis of President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s peace formula, which stresses the inviolability of territorial integrity and sovereignty and a complete withdrawal of Russian forces. Russia continues to hold roughly one-fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory while its forces are steadily pushing forward in the Donbas region.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-support-despite-policies/	2024-10-23T05:21:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1259010576.jpg
France's first batch of Mirage 2000 jets to include 3 planes, media reports	France will deliver its first three Mirage 2000-5s fighter jets to Ukraine in the first quarter of 2025, the French newspaper La Tribune reported on Oct. 23, citing its sources. Paris previously confirmed it would begin transferring its aircraft in the first three months of the next year but did not comment on the numbers. The timing of delivery takes into account the time needed to train pilots and mechanics and prepare the aircraft, La Tribune wrote. According to the outlet, the planes will be equipped with ground strike capabilities, namely SCALP/Storm Shadow long-range missiles and French guided bombs AASM Hammer. France and the U.K. have previously supplied Kyiv with SCALP and Storm Shadow missiles that have a range of up to 250 kilometers (150 miles) and have been successfully deployed against Russian military targets in Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The French Defense Ministry refused to comment for La Tribune. The Mirage 2000 is a multirole aircraft designed in the late 1970s and introduced in 1984. The 2000-5 version has upgraded radar systems and can carry fuel drop tanks, greatly increasing its range. French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans for their delivery to Ukraine in June, saying that France would also provide training to Ukrainian pilots and staff. He did not reveal how many aircraft France plans to send in total. The Mirage 2000-5 is a fourth-generation fighter jet, meaning it is in the same class as the U.S.-made F-16 that Ukraine&apos;s Air Force already operates. Denmark and the Netherlands were the first countries to deliver their F-16s, making them the first Western fighter jets in Ukraine&apos;s arsenal. While Kyiv awaits Mirages and additional F-16s, it is also in talks to acquire Swedish-made Saab JAS 39 Gripen and the Eurofighter Typhoon fighters.	https://kyivindependent.com/mirage-2000-first-batch/	2024-10-23T04:37:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1231073461.jpg
North Korean troops are in Russia, US defense secretary confirms	There is evidence that North Korean troops are in Russia, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in Rome on Oct. 23, Reuters reported. Austin&apos;s comment comes as the first public confirmation by the U.S. of previous statements by Ukraine and South Korea. The two nations say Russia is planning to involve thousands of North Korean troops in its full-scale war. &quot;There is evidence that there are DPRK (North Korean) troops in Russia. What exactly they are doing? Left to be seen. These are things that we need to sort out,&quot; the Pentagon chief said. Austin did not specify the number of North Korean troops that had arrived in Russia. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR), said that the first North Korean units were expected to arrive in Kursk Oblast on Oct. 23 .

A military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 21 that Russian authorities detained 18 North Korean soldiers who abandoned their positions in Kursk Oblast. Video footage has also circulated purporting to show North Korean troops at a Russian military training camp. South Korean media reported on Oct. 22 that Pyongyang has dispatched pilots who can fly Russian warplanes to join the war in Ukraine. South Korea&apos;s Yonhap agency also said that South Korea is considering sending personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-arrive-in-russia-pentagon-chief-confirms/	2024-10-23T03:41:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-2096837949.jpg
Georgia denies journalist entry to cover elections amid rising Russian influence	Czech-British journalist Ray Baseley was denied entry to Georgia without an explanation after arriving at Tbilisi airport on Oct. 22 to cover the upcoming parliamentary elections. He is currently being held at the airport and should be deported in two days, his partner told the Kyiv Independent. As Georgians head to the polls on Oct. 26, thousands rallied in Tbilisi last weekend to demonstrate support for EU membership in the face of democratic backsliding and the Moscow-friendly direction of the ruling Georgian Dream party. Baseley, a freelancer from whom the Kyiv Independent agreed to commission stories covering the Georgian elections, wrote on X on Oct. 22 that he had been refused entry after arriving by plane without explanation. &quot;Today at 19:30 I was refused entry into the country of Georgia without reasoning or any further explanation, this is unacceptable, even the local border force doesn&#x2019;t know why I wasn&#x2019;t allowed entry,&quot; Baseley wrote. He posted a photo of the entry refusal form on social media. The document does not explain the reason, marking &quot;Other cases envisaged by Georgian legislation&quot; as grounds for the decision. Baseley holds Czech citizenship. Hello Georgians, Journalists and Czechs. Today at 19:30 I was refused entry into the country of Georgia without reasoning or any further explanation this is unacceptable even the local border force doesn&#x2019;t know why I wasn&#x2019;t allowed entry. Anyone who can help please write to me. pic.twitter.com/4HGh3xY9ma The journalist&apos;s partner, Ukrainian Maria Kaplina, told the Kyiv Independent later the same day that Georgian authorities had taken Baseley and that she had lost contact with him. Kaplina got in touch with him only the following day after Baseley was allowed to make a phone call. &quot;The current situation is that Ray is still in the Tbilisi airport. No one explained to him why they are keeping him there or why they are deporting him,&quot; Kaplina told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;This is a totally illegal action, and they&apos;re keeping him there for more than 17 hours. The (Czech) consul and a lawyer are working now to be able to enter the facility where they keep him. Authorities are preparing to deport him in two days.&quot; A Czech Foreign Ministry spokesperson told the Kyiv Independent that Prague is aware of the situation and has reached out to Georgian authorities regarding the case. &quot;Our consul is in contact with his (Baseley&apos;s) loved ones, and she has sent an official note to the Georgian Foreign Ministry, requesting information about his current location and the reason for his detention and denial of entry,&quot; spokesperson Daniel Drake said. Baseley is a Prague-based journalist who has also broadly covered Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine as a freelance reporter. Baseley previously reported on protests in Tbilisi that broke out in the spring over the adoption of a &quot;foreign agents&quot; law by the ruling Georgian Dream party. The legislation, which has been compared to a similar law in Russia, was aimed at NGOs and media organizations receiving funding from abroad. Its adoption was seen as a signal of the democratic backsliding and deteriorating media freedom under the Georgian Dream.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgia-denies-journalist-entry-to-cover-elections-amid-rising-russian-influence/	2024-10-23T03:33:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Ray.png
Ukraine receives $1.1 billion from IMF	Ukraine has received a tranche of nearly $1.1 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after the successful completion of the fifth programme revision, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Oct. 23. &quot;The funds will be used to cover important non-military budget spending,&quot; Shmyhal said. Foreign aid is crucial for Ukraine as the economic pressure caused by the full-scale Russian invasion mounts. The besieged country received $42.5 billion in external financing last year, allowing it to function amid the ongoing war. The IMF has reached a preliminary agreement with Ukraine to provide Kyiv with another tranche in September. At the same time, the IMF said that the risks to Ukraine &quot;remain exceptionally high&quot; with the expected economic slowdown due to repeated Russian attacks on the country&apos;s energy infrastructure and the impact of the war on labor markets and confidence. The IMF said Kyiv needs to &quot;respect financing constraints and debt sustainability objectives&quot; in the 2025 budget. The EFF funds are meant to lend Ukraine stability amid the disruptions of war, support the country&apos;s postwar recovery, and promote economic growth as Ukraine moves forward on the path to EU membership. The EFF is a long-term funding agreement that will allow Ukraine to access $15.6 billion in financial aid in regular installments.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-receives-1-1-billion-from-imf/	2024-10-23T03:17:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2171755093.jpg
SBU says it foiled terror attack in Kyiv, detained suspects	Law enforcement officers detained two Ukrainians who were preparing a terror attack in the city of Kyiv and were coordinated by Russian intelligence, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed on Oct. 23. According to the statement, the suspects planned to detonate improvised explosives in a crowded place in Ukraine&apos;s capital to cause &quot;the maximum number of civilian deaths&quot; and sow panic. Throughout the full-scale war, Ukrainian law enforcement agencies have accused numerous citizens of spying or otherwise cooperating with Russian security services. Law enforcement officers detained two Ukrainians who were preparing a terror attack in the city of Kyiv and were coordinated by Russian intelligence, the Security Service of Ukraine claimed on Oct. 23, 2024. (SBU/Telegram)Russian intelligence allegedly recruited a 20-year-old resident of the city of Zaporizhzhia via Telegram and instructed her on how to make explosives. She also engaged her 26-year-old partner to cooperate, the SBU said. The SBU claimed that the suspect was in contact with a Russian military intelligence officer from the Russian-occupied territory of Zaporizhzhia Oblast. She used two cell phones to connect a detonator with plastic explosives, which she had to get from a hidden cache, according to the law enforcement agency. Before the planned terror attack, the two were supposed to fulfill a &quot;test task&quot; and set on fire several vehicles of the Ukrainian military in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The SBU detained both of them when they tried to set fire to an infantry fighting vehicle. If charged, the suspects may face life in prison with confiscation of property.	https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-claims-it-foiled-planned-terror-attack-in-kyiv-detained-suspects/	2024-10-23T03:00:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-23_09-50-24.jpg
UK to allocate $155 million for naval coalition to protect Ukraine's ports	London will donate an additional 120 million pounds ($155 million) to the Maritime Capability Coalition to support Ukraine&apos;s Navy, the U.K. government announced on Oct. 22. The move comes as a response to Russia stepping up attacks against port infrastructure in southern Odesa Oblast that resulted in damaged civilian ships and casualties. &quot;Russia&apos;s indiscriminate strikes on ports in the Black Sea underscore that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is willing to gamble on global food security in his attempts to force Ukraine into submission,&quot; U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said. The British government accused Russia of threatening global food security, including humanitarian supplies to war-stricken Palestine, just as some Global South leaders gather in the Russian city of Kazan for the BRICS summit. The U.K. is looking for partners to co-finance the supply of &quot;hundreds&quot; more naval drones as well as surveillance radars to protect Ukraine&apos;s grain corridor. London and Oslo are also seeking a further 100 million pounds ($129 million) to co-fund hundreds more. As part of the naval coalition, Ukraine has received dozens of amphibious all-terrain vehicles and raiding boats, hundreds of anti-ship missiles, and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition, according to the statement. Over the past three months, Russia has carried out nearly 60 attacks on Ukrainian ports, damaging or destroying nearly 300 port infrastructure facilities and 22 civilian vessels, said on Oct. 10 Oleksii Kuleba, the minister for the development of communities, territories, and infrastructure. Over 80 civilians were killed or injured as a result of these strikes.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-naval-coalition/	2024-10-23T02:48:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-51838376.jpg
Zelensky preparing action plan for Ukraine to withstand war, source says	President Volodymyr Zelensky tasked the Ukrainian authorities to develop proposals for an internal action plan to help the country withstand the war, a source close to the Presidential Office told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 23. According to the source, the document will address military, political, economic, and other areas, including certain decisions regarding law enforcement. The plan is expected to be prepared and presented to the Ukrainian public by the end of 2024, BBC Ukraine reported earlier in the day, citing unnamed government sources. The Kyiv Independent&apos;s source said that it may take several more weeks to develop the document. &quot;The goal is to do everything possible to maintain unity and achieve results in various areas of the country&apos;s development,&quot; a source in Zelensky&apos;s team told BBC. The plan reportedly is not an alternative to Zelensky&apos;s victory plan and provides for steps to be taken by Ukraine itself. Zelensky publicly unveiled his five-point victory plan on Oct. 16, which includes Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO placed atop the list. The victory plan also includes a defense aspect, non-nuclear deterrence of Russian aggression, economic growth and cooperation, and post-war security architecture. It is also comprised of three classified addenda that have been shared with international partners. Ukraine&apos;s president said that a victory plan &quot;can bridge the gap between the current situation and the successful peace summit.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-preparing-ukraines-action-plan-to-withstand-war-source/	2024-10-23T01:37:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177157663.jpg
Russia helping North Korea with sanctions evasion, nuclear technology in return for soldiers, arms, Budanov says	Russia is helping Pyongyang evade sanctions and develop its nuclear capabilities in return for North Korean troops and missiles, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov told The Economist in comments published on Oct. 22. Budanov previously revealed that close to 11,000 North Korean troops are already in Russia and will be ready to fight by Nov. 1. The move would signal deepening military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang, with North Korea already providing Russia with artillery shells and ballistic missiles for war against Ukraine. Russia&apos;s support in nuclear capabilities includes providing technologies for smaller tactical nuclear weapons and submarine missile-launch systems, Budanov claimed. The sanctions evasion can also be vital for North Korea, which faces heavy economic restrictions over its nuclear program. Russia has blocked the renewal of a U.N. monitoring program overseeing Pyongyang&apos;s nuclear and ballistic missile development. Speaking to The Economist, the Ukrainian spy chief said that the military personnel sent to Russia included 500 officers and three generals. A contingent of 2,600 troops should allegedly soon arrive in Kursk Oblast, a Russian border region partially held by Ukraine. North Korean troops are currently undergoing training in Khabarovsk Krai in Russia&apos;s far east, Budanov said. According to him, Pyongyang has also supplied Russia with 2.8 million artillery shells and an unspecified number of ballistic missiles, which are serviced by North Korean crews. Kyiv and Seoul have repeatedly sounded alarm on North Korea transferring personnel to Russia, though the reports have not been confirmed by the U.S. or other Western officials. North Korea has denied the reports, while a Kremlin spokesperson gave an evasive answer on the issue. President Volodymyr Zelensky urged Ukraine&apos;s allies to mount pressure on North Korea, calling for a &quot;concrete response&quot; to the country&apos;s escalating military support of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Two North Korean brigades of up to 6,000 personnel each are currently undergoing training in Russia, Zelensky said in his evening address, citing military intelligence reports. He also said that impoverished North Korea is likely receiving financial support for its military aid.	https://kyivindependent.com/budanov-north-korea-nuclear/	2024-10-23T00:51:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175735683.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 5, injure 14 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least five people and injured at least 14 over the past day, regional authorities reported early on Oct. 23. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 57 of the 81 Shahed-type drones launched overnight, the Air Force reported. Fifteen drones were lost, and nine are still present in the Ukrainian airspace at the time of the publication. Russia also reportedly attacked Odesa with a Kh-31P missile. No damage or casualties were reported at the moment. Russia launched over 20 attacks against the Nikopol district of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast on Oct. 22, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. One person was killed and another injured. In Donetsk Oblast, three people were killed and seven injured in Russian attacks, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. A strike against the village of Oleksandro-Kalynove killed two residents and injured two others. One person was killed in Riznykivka, three were injured in Myrnohrad, and one each in Pleshchiivka and Lyman, the governor said. Russian attacks against Kharkiv Oblast killed one person and injured four, said the regional governor, Oleh Syniehubov. Two women and one man were injured during an overnight attack against the village of Lisne, and a 65-year-old woman was wounded in the town of Kupiansk. A 54-year-old man was killed during a drone attack against the village of Kucherivka, the governor reported. Two people were injured during attacks in Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. Three multi-story buildings, 24 houses, and other buildings were damaged. Cherkasy, Kyiv, Luhansk, Odesa, Vinnytsia, Khmelnytskyi, Ternopil, Kirovohrad, Poltava, Chernihiv, Mykolaiv, Sumy, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts also came under attack, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-98/	2024-10-23T00:12:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Donetsk-Oct-23.jpg
UN secretary general visits Russia for BRICS summit despite Kyiv's criticism	U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres arrived at the BRICS summit in the Russian city of Kazan on Oct. 22, despite criticism from Ukraine, Voice of America reported. The BRICS group, a bloc of countries that includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates, is convening in Kazan for a three-day summit from Oct. 22-24. According to Moscow, 36 world leaders are participating in the conference. Guterres is expected to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the event on Oct. 24, according to Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry criticized the U.N. secretary general&apos;s visit. &quot;The U.N. secretary-general declined Ukraine&apos;s invitation to the first global peace summit in Switzerland. He did, however, accept the invitation to Kazan from war criminal Putin,&quot; the ministry said on social media. &quot;This is a wrong choice that does not advance the cause of peace. It only damages the U.N.&apos;s reputation.&quot; Switzerland hosted Ukraine&apos;s global peace summit on June 15-16, with representatives of around 100 countries and organizations in attendance. Seventy-eight states and four organizations signed the final joint communique of the peace summit. Since then, multiple countries have signed on the ever-expanding list of delegations. Guterres has repeatedly criticized Russia for its full-scale war against Ukraine. The U.N. and Turkey also brokered the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which allowed Kyiv to export its agricultural products. The agreement collapsed after Moscow had pulled out in 2023. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, among other leaders, also arrived at the summit. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has canceled the trip after suffering a head injury at home. At the meeting, Russia will seek to convince the BRICS countries to create an alternative platform for international payments that would be immune to Western sanctions, Reuters reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/guterres-brics-russia/	2024-10-23T00:00:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173387817.jpg
US to continue to 'tighten the screws' on Russian LNG exports, senior official says	The U.S. will continue to &quot;tighten the screws&quot; on the export of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) to deprive Moscow of energy revenues, Bloomberg reported on Oct. 22, citing Jeffrey Pyatt, the assistant secretary of state for energy resources. Washington slapped sanctions against Arctic LNG 2 in 2023 and started imposing restrictions on ships that began taking LNG from the plant this August. Arctic LNG 2, owned by Russia&apos;s Novatek company, aims to produce almost 20 million metric tons of LNG per year to sell primarily to Asian markets, potentially generating billions of dollars in revenue. Washington has not imposed sanctions on other Russian LNG plants, including Yamal and Portovaya, which continue to supply liquefied natural gas to Europe and Asia. If sanctioned, this can likely lead to a reduction in global LNG supplies and higher prices, Bloomberg reported. According to Pyatt, the U.S. aims to reduce the revenues Russia receives from its oil and gas resources. He said that such a &quot;policy is working,&quot; and the U.S. is closely monitoring where the sanctioned Russian cargoes are heading. &quot;You can be assured that the Biden administration is going to continue to tighten the screws against Russia&#x2019;s LNG exports,&quot; the senior official added. The Financial Times reported in July that Russia is likely expanding its &quot;ghost fleet&quot; of tankers, created primarily to avoid Western oil sanctions, to LNG exports as well.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-continue-to-tighten-the-screws-on-russian-lng-exports/	2024-10-22T23:01:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2159134522.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 683,040 troops since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 683,040 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 23. This number includes 1,460 casualties Russian forces suffered over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,088 tanks, 18,229 armored fighting vehicles, 27,217 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,674 artillery systems, 1,234 multiple launch rocket systems, 981 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 17,489 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-683-040-troops-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-22T22:17:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2174645997.jpg
Russia-linked disinformation campaign spreads false claims about Tim Walz, US intelligence officials say	Russian disinformation groups have been linked to viral attacks targeting Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, U.S. intelligence sources said on Oct. 22. Walz has served as governor of Minnesota since 2019 after spending 12 years in Congress. He is an army veteran, having enlisted in the National Guard as a teenager and serving for another 24 years. Walz was also a high school teacher before entering politics. The false content that was spread, which includes baseless claims about Walz&#x2019;s past as a teacher, was found to have several signs of manipulation. Analysts connected the disinformation to Russian operations aimed at undermining the Democratic ticket of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Private researchers had already flagged these videos as fake, with one particularly false claim involving a man impersonating a former student of Walz&apos;s to accuse him of misconduct. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Walz has been a vocal advocate for Ukraine in its fight against Russia, signing legislation barring state agencies from doing business with Russian and Belarusian companies. His state, Minnesota, is also home to weapons manufacturers that supply arms critical for Ukraine&#x2019;s defense. Walz previously met President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2023 in a conversation organized by the National Governors Association. &quot;It was an honor to hear from President Zelensky firsthand and offer him our unwavering support,&quot; Walz said at the time. &quot;Minnesota is a proud home to many Ukrainian families, and we will continue to welcome and support Ukrainian refugees in our state.&quot; U.S. intelligence officials report that Russia continues to actively run influence campaigns aimed at boosting former President and Republican nominee Donald Trump. According to the U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby, Russia&#x2019;s meddling in the U.S. presidential elections is &#x201C;more sophisticated&#x201D; than before. Kirby claims that Russia is using artificial intelligence and funding companies in the U.S., including Tennessee-based far-right propaganda outlet, Tenet Media. &#x201C;It&apos;s not just about Russian bots, trolls, and fake personas in social networks, although that&apos;s part of it too, but they&apos;ve become much more sophisticated,&quot; Kirby said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-linked-disinformation-campaign-spreads-false-claims-about-tim-walz-us-intelligence-officials-say/	2024-10-22T21:37:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2164176277.jpg
Turkey quietly curbs military goods exports to Russia following US warning, FT reports	Turkey has quietly blocked the export of U.S.-origin military goods to Russia following a warning from Washington, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Oct. 22. In recent weeks, Ankara updated its customs systems to stop the export of over 40 categories of U.S.-made items deemed critical to Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine, according to FT sources. The new restrictions target goods such as microchips, processors, and control systems, believed to be used in weapons. According to the report, Turkish banks have also reduced dealings with Russian entities over the past year, following U.S. threats of sanctions. The updated policy regarding Russian exports was not publicly announced due to political sensitivities. While Turkey is a NATO member, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has aimed to maintain positive relations with both Russia and Ukraine. Turkey has also facilitated the flow of Russian oil to the European Union since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, enabling the Kremlin to circumvent the bloc&#x2019;s sanctions. In 2023, Turkey became the world&#x2019;s biggest buyer of Russian fossil fuels, importing around 42.2 billion euros ($45.9 billion) in oil, natural gas, and coal from the country &#x2013; a fivefold increase over the past decade. At the same time, Erdogan has publicly supported Ukrainian sovereignty, and his administration has given significant aid to Ukraine since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. &quot;We support Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity, together with Ukrainian Crimea,&quot; Erdogan said on Feb. 3. Turkey also brokered a grain deal in 2022, along with the UN, that was essential in mitigating a global surge in food prices partially caused by the war. It allowed Ukraine to export its agricultural products via the Black Sea, despite the ongoing invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/turkey-quietly-curbs-military-goods-exports-to-russia-following-us-warning-ft-reports/	2024-10-22T19:21:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1239585119.jpg
Poland shuts down Russian Consulate in Poznan amid claims of sabotage	Poland is closing down the Russian Consulate in Poznan due to alleged sabotage attempts from Russia, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski announced on Oct. 22. A number of suspected spy networks, allegedly run by Minsk and Moscow, have been uncovered in Poland over the past years. Warsaw has positioned itself as one of the staunchest supporters of Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, leading to a sharp deterioration of ties with Russia and Belarus. &quot;Russia is waging a hybrid war,&quot; Sikorski said in a post on X. &quot;It is attempting sabotage on Polish territory. ... (I)t is my duty to react decisively. The first step is to close the Russian Consulate in Poznan.&quot; Moscow intends to retaliate against the decision, according to Russian state media. An infiltration attempt involving recruitment efforts by the Russian mercenary group Wagner was recently uncovered in Krakow, Poland. Last week, the Krakow District Court began the trial of two Russian nationals, Andrei G. and Aleksei T., who the Wagner Group allegedly hired to distribute flyers in Krakow, encouraging people to join the organization. They face charges related to foreign intelligence activities and involvement with an international armed group intending to commit acts of terrorism. Aside from Poland, they supposedly also worked in other European cities, including Berlin and Paris, hanging flyers and distributing stickers with QR codes for enlistment. Russia is responsible for 80% of all the foreign influence operations in the world, Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said at a conference in Prague on Oct. 9. According to Lipavsky, Europe must gear up its vigilance to counter such threats. &quot;We need much more determination in the fight against Kremlin influence than we have shown so far. The solution lies in strategic communication, sanctions, exposing crimes, and utilizing existing legal measures,&quot; Lipavsky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-shuts-down-russian-consulate-in-poznan-amid-claims-of-sabotage/	2024-10-22T18:15:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158687722.jpg
Ukraine's population dropped by 10 million after Russia's 2014 invasion, UN says	Ukraine&apos;s population has declined by over 10 million since Russia invaded in 2014, according to Florence Bauer, regional director for the Eastern European and Central Asian branch of the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA). Russian troops first invaded Ukraine in 2014, occupying parts of the eastern Donbas region and illegally annexing the Crimean peninsula. Since then, Ukraine&apos;s population has fallen by over 10 million and the number of refugees has surged to 6.7 million, with the full-scale invasion of 2022 exacerbating an already dire decline. &quot;The birth rate plummeted and is currently at around one child per woman, which is one of the lowest in the world,&quot; &#xA0;Bauer said on Oct. 22 at a briefing in Geneva. Ukraine&apos;s birth rate is now the lowest in Europe, according to the U.N. Refugees account for a major portion of Ukraine&apos;s population loss, with casualties of Russia&apos;s war another contributing &#xA0;factor. &#xA0; &quot;It&apos;s difficult to have exact numbers, but estimates range around tens of thousands of casualties,&quot; Bauer said. The population of Ukraine totaled 37.441 million as of Jan. 1, 2024, but more declines are expected in the coming years. A U.N. forecast in July predicted that the population might drop to as low as 15.3 million people by 2100. Ukraine and the UNFPA have partnered in developing a national demographic strategy, Bauer said. The strategy focuses on human capital rather than simply trying to increase the birth rate. The path to population stability also depends on an end to the war, Bauer acknowledged. Russia is facing its own demographic crisis, with a projected decline of about 7 million over the next two decades.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-population-dropped-by-10-million-after-russias-2014-invasion-un-says/	2024-10-22T16:04:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179816217.jpg
Zelensky urges allies to increase pressure on North Korea	President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 22 urged Ukraine&apos;s allies to mount pressure on North Korea, calling for a &quot;concrete response&quot; to the country&apos;s escalating military support of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Two North Korean brigades of up to 6,000 personnel each are currently undergoing training in Russia, Zelensky said in his evening address, citing military intelligence reports. &quot;But we know how to respond to this challenge,&quot; he said. &quot;And it is important that our partners do not shy away from this challenge as well. All partners.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence has reported that Moscow is planning to involve Pyongyang in the full-scale war against Ukraine in the coming months, with around 10,000 North Korean soldiers preparing to join the Russian army. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), said on Oct. 22 that North Korean troops are expected to arrive in Kursk Oblast on Oct. 23 to support the Russian military against Ukraine&apos;s incursion in the region. &quot;If North Korea can intervene in the war in Europe, then the pressure on this regime is definitely not strong enough,&quot; Zelensky said. The involvement of North Korean troops would mark a &quot;significant escalation&quot; in Russia&apos;s war, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on Oct. 21, without directly confirming the reports. The U.S. has also said it is &quot;concerned&quot; by reports of North Korea&apos;s increased participation, with a White House spokesperson saying such a move would indicate &quot;a new level of desperation&quot; on Moscow&apos;s part. The South Korean government has expressed alarm, and is reportedly considering dispatching a monitoring team to Ukraine. North Korea&apos;s direct involvement may also prompt Seoul to revisit its stance on supplying weapons to Kyiv. Zelensky in his address called on international partners to &quot;stop Russia and its allies&quot; from expanding the scope of the war. &quot;Aggressors must be stopped. We expect a firm, concrete response from the world. Hopefully, not only in words.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-urges-allies-to-increase-pressure-on-north-korea/	2024-10-22T14:22:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/zelensky-1.png
North Korean troops to arrive in Kursk tomorrow, military intelligence says	North Korean troops are expected to arrive in Kursk Oblast on Oct. 23 to support the Russian military against Ukraine&apos;s incursion in the region, Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR), told the War Zone on Oct. 22. &#xA0; &quot;We are waiting for the first units tomorrow in the Kursk direction,&quot; Budanov said, though he did not specify how many would be deployed. &quot;We will see after a couple of days.&quot; Budanov&apos;s statement follows reports that Moscow is planning to involve Pyongyang in the full-scale war against Ukraine in the coming months, with around 10,000 North Korean soldiers preparing to join the Russian army. Budanov said earlier in October that the first group of 2,600 soldiers would be deployed to Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. North Korea has denied sending troops to join Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, calling the recent reports &quot;groundless rumors.&quot; Despite the denials, reports of increased military involvement continue to mount. A military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 21 that Russian authorities detained 18 North Korean soldiers who abandoned their positions in Kursk Oblast. Video footage has also circulated purporting to show North Korean troops at a Russian military training camp. South Korean media reported on Oct. 22 that Pyongyang has dispatched pilots who can fly Russian warplanes to join the war in Ukraine. A government source in Seoul also said that South Korea is considering sending personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Oct. 22 that two North Korean military units of up to 6,000 personnel each are currently undergoing training for the front.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-to-arrive-in-kursk-tomorrow-military-intelligence-says/	2024-10-22T13:09:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2166040844-2.jpg
Putin, Xi discuss war in Ukraine at BRICS summit in Russia	Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping discussed Ukraine during their meeting on Oct. 22 at the BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia. The BRICS alliance, a bloc of countries that now includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates, is convening in Kazan for a three-day summit from Oct. 22-24. According to Moscow, 36 world leaders are participating in the conference. Putin and Xi reportedly spoke for about an hour, according to Russian state media. The leaders discussed Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, the BRICS agenda, and bilateral relations. &quot;The world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century, and the international situation is chaotic and intertwined,&quot; Xi said. Xi and Putin during their meeting &quot;outlined the main parameters of further contacts to continue the dialogue,&quot; according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Russia hopes to increase cooperation with China on &quot;all international platforms,&quot; Putin said. Xi and Putin concurred that the bilateral relations were at a historical highpoint, and jointly protect &quot;regional tranquility and stability.&quot; Although China officially maintains a neutral stance on Russia&apos;s full-scale war in Ukraine and denies providing lethal aid, Beijing and Moscow continue to strengthen their economic and political ties. At a previous meeting in Kazakhstan in July, Xi and Putin concurred that the bilateral relations were at a historic high point. Chinese companies have been sanctioned by the U.S. for producing drones used in Russia&apos;s war. Various countries have accused China of aiding Russia by providing machine tools, weapons technology, satellite imagery, semiconductors, and other dual-use technologies. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 17 that intelligence data indicates that &quot;China is actively helping Russia drag out this war.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-xi-discuss-war-in-ukraine-at-brics-summit-in-russia/	2024-10-22T12:53:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179438248.jpg
Ukraine war latest: US to provide Ukraine with $800 million to boost domestic long-range capabilities	Key developments on Oct. 22: The U.S. is planning to provide Ukraine with an aid package of $700-800 million for the domestic development of long-range capabilities, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Oct. 21. On the same day, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a new $400 million military aid package during a surprise visit to Kyiv. In addition, Zelensky also said that Washington is preparing to provide $800 million for the production of Ukrainian drones. &quot;Then there should be also the next tranche in the amount of $700-800 million,&quot; Zelensky said at a meeting attended by the Kyiv Independent, in reference to the package designated for long-range capabilities. Zelensky and Austin also discussed how much of the $8 billion in aid the U.S. announced in late September could be dedicated to Ukrainian production by the end of this year. Domestically produced long-range weapons are key to Ukraine&apos;s defense strategy, as Western partners refuse to authorize deep strikes in Russia with foreign-made missiles. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Oct. 21 that Ukraine had invested more than $4 billion in its defense production and urged international partners to invest further, recalling the recent successes of Ukrainian specialists in drone manufacturing. Despite Zelensky&apos;s appeal to Washington during his recent White House visit, the U.S. has not yet altered its policy on long-range strikes. Ukrainian drones attacked four plants in Tula, Tambov and Voronezh oblasts in Russia overnight on Oct. 22, Russian local authorities claimed. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed its air defenses destroyed 11 drones over Bryansk Oblast, three over Belgorod Oblast, two over Kursk Oblast, one over Tula Oblast, and one over Oryol Oblast. In Tambov Oblast, a Ukrainian drone reportedly set to fire the Biokhim distillery in the town of Rasskazovo, according to Governor Maxim Egorov. According to the Biokhim website, it produces &quot;products of strategic importance for the state,&quot; in particular ethanol, a solvent which is used in the manufacture of a wide range of products including explosives. Two more distilleries came under the attack in the settlements of Efremov and Luzhkovsky in Tula Oblast overnight, Governor Dmitry Milyaev said. Alexander Gusev, Voronezh Oblast governor, claimed a drone attack caused a minor fire on one of the floors of an industrial enterprise. No casualties have reported. The Ukrainian military has not yet commented on the reports, which cannot be verified independently. Ukraine has carried out a number of strikes against airbases and other military facilities in an effort to weaken the more powerful Russian Air Force and curb Moscow&apos;s ability to launch devastating aerial attacks against Ukrainian cities. North Korea has dispatched pilots who can fly Russian warplanes to join the war in Ukraine, Newsweek reported on Oct. 22, citing South Korean television network TV Chosun. Moscow is planning to involve Pyongyang in the full-scale war against Ukraine in the coming months, with around 10,000 North Korean soldiers being prepared to join the Russian army, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said earlier in October that the first group of 2,600 soldiers would be deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. North Korea denied sending troops to join Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, calling the recent reports &quot;groundless rumors.&quot; The report said that this move could mean further training of pilots on Russian combat aircraft. If the report is confirmed, Russia will become the first country where North Korean pilots will be stationed outside their country since the Vietnam War. They also previously participated in combat operations in Syria and Egypt during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. A Western official told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15 that 10,000 North Korean soldiers had already been sent to Russia. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine&#x2019;s HUR military intelligence service, put the number at 11,000 and said they would be &quot;ready to fight&quot; by Nov. 1. A video purportedly showing them at a military training camp inside Russia has also surfaced online. Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened military cooperation as Russia seeks arms and other support in its full-scale war against Ukraine. North Korea has also been supplying Russia with ballistic missiles and vast quantities of artillery shells. South Korea is considering sending a team of personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops that Russia may involve in its full-scale war, Yonhap agency reported on Oct. 22, citing an unnamed government source. &quot;There is a possibility that personnel will be sent to Ukraine to monitor the tactics and combat capabilities of North Korean special forces dispatched in support of Russia,&quot; the source said. Moscow is planning to involve Pyongyang in the full-scale war against Ukraine in the coming months, with around 10,000 North Korean soldiers being prepared to join the Russian army, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said that the first group of 2,600 soldiers will be deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. He said that close to 11,000 North Korean troops are in Russia and will be &quot;ready to fight&quot; in Ukraine by Nov. 1. If deployed, a South Korean team may include military personnel from intelligence units who will be able to analyze Pyongyang&apos;s warfare tactics or participate in the interrogations of captured North Koreans. The government is also reportedly considering providing Ukraine with armed support. Up until now, Seoul has only provided humanitarian aid to Kyiv, though it has been reported the country has indirectly supplied artillery shells via the U.S. In June, South Korea said it would reconsider its policy of not directly supplying Ukraine with weapons after Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un signed a security agreement in Pyongyang. &quot;While watching signs of North Korea-Russia military cooperation, the response measures will be taken in steps,&quot; the source told Yonhap. The source said that sending defensive weapons will be prioritized over lethal arms, adding that even if lethal weapons are provided, South Korea will first consider providing them to Kyiv indirectly. While the U.S. has been cautious about confirming Russia&apos;s plans to engage Pyongyang in its war, South Korea is sounding the alarm, calling such a scenario a &#xA0;&quot;grave security threat&quot; to the international community. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it believes North Korea will deploy four brigades totaling 12,000 soldiers to the war in Ukraine, including 1,500 special forces. The Group of Seven (G7) plans to keep Russian assets frozen even after the end of Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, the Japanese news agency Nikkei reported on Oct. 22, citing its undisclosed sources from G7. European countries hold roughly two-thirds of the $300 billion in Russian sovereign assetsimmobilized after the outbreak of the full-scale war. While hesitant to confiscate the assets outright, the European Union has devised a plan to use windfall profits to fund Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction and defense needs. G7 leaders will issue a joint statement in October saying that &quot;Russia&apos;s sovereign assets will remain immobilized until Russia ends its aggression and pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine,&quot; according to the draft prepared by this year&apos;s chair, Italy. The bloc will also guarantee a $50 billion loan to Kyiv, Nikkei reported, citing the draft. During the June G7 summit in Italy, G7 leaders publicly confirmed a deal to provide Ukraine with the $50 billion loan by the end of the year. The loan will be repaid using interest from billions in frozen Russian assets. In September, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a loan of up to 35 billion euros ($39 billion) as part of that pledge. In October, the World Bank&apos;s executive committee approved the creation of a new fund to help fulfill G7&apos;s $50 billion loan. Estimates of the damage that Russia&apos;s aggression has caused to Ukrainian infrastructure over the past decade vary. The World Bank said in February that it could be as high as $486 billion. Under the G7 plan, profits from Russia&apos;s frozen assets will gradually be used to repay the loan. EU officials have said that the loan would be &quot;undesignated&quot; and &quot;untargeted,&quot; allowing Ukraine maximum flexibility in how it spends the funds. The EU expects to start distributing the money early next year.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-39/	2024-10-22T12:21:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1980079331.jpg
Zelensky denies potential dismissal of defense minister, head of military intelligence	President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 21 denied rumors regarding the possible resignation of military intelligence head Kyrylo Budanov and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. &quot;I wasn&apos;t going to do that. I was not going to replace Budanov. This information was circulating, yes. There was no such question about Umerov either,&quot; Zelensky said during a meeting with journalists. Zelensky&apos;s statement followed media speculation that Budanov was in line for dismissal. Budanov, 38, has been the head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence since August 2020. In late September, Umerov dismissed two of Budanov&apos;s deputies, Viktor Zaitsev and Ihor Ostapenko. The decision was not made in cooperation with Budanov, Ukrainska Pravda reported, citing an undisclosed source. Consequently, reports about Budanov&apos;s possible dismissal began circulating in the Ukrainian media. Servant of the People lawmaker Yurii Mysiagin, who is deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament Committee on National Security, Defense, and Intelligence, said via his Telegram channel on Oct. 2 that the question of replacing Budanov was &quot;not considered.&quot; Zelensky carried out a major government reshuffle in September, saying that there was a &quot;need for new energy.&quot; During the staff rotations, the Cabinet of Ministers and the list of deputy heads of the Presidential Office were partially updated.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-denies-potential-dismissal-of-defense-minister-head-of-military-intelligence/	2024-10-22T12:11:26-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1733350996.jpg
Not waiting until the war is over'– Foreign investment keeps growing in Ukraine	Ukraine is still far from an investor&apos;s paradise, but increasingly valuable business deals are being signed in the war-torn country this year. &#xA0;In the first nine months of 2024, there were 36 Ukrainian mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) with a total estimated value of $643 million, according to a new report from KPMG Ukraine, an accounting organization based in Kyiv. The average value of M&amp;As was $38 million.For comparison, there were 37 deals worth $625 million in the same period last year with an average value of $27 million.The start of the full-scale invasion painted a bleak scene for Ukraine&#x2019;s M&amp;As with only 28 deals amounting to $494 million in 2022, the lowest level in a decade. But Ukraine&#x2019;s business activity is slowly rising from the ashes, bolstered by inflation control and gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2023, and topped off with resilient companies. Ukrainian M&amp;A deal activity. (Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)Foreign investors eye up opportunities Despite Ukraine&#x2019;s struggles on the battlefield this year and Russian attacks wiping out a chunk of its energy infrastructure, foreign investment has perked up this year. There were 10 inbound deals worth an estimated $473 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 13 deals in 2023 bringing in $278 million.The majority of inbound deals came from North America and Europe, with three transactions totaling $255 million and five transactions accounting for $159 million, respectively. Those that are coming in are willing to take the high risks for the high reward, but are investing in companies that operate successfully and staying away from distressed assets, Dmytro Boroday, a partner at private equity firm Horizon Capital, told the Kyiv Independent. Sectors like metal and mining, that have been hard hit by the invasion, have seen no M&amp;A activity since the start of the full-scale invasion. Many of the assets have been targeted by Russia and are located close to frontline regions. Ukrainian M&amp;A deals by sector. (Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)This year has also seen an inbound deal from beyond Ukraine&#x2019;s European and American allies after the Saudi Agricultural and Livestock Investment Company (SALIC) acquired a 12.6% stake for $54 million in Ukrainian agri-tech company MHP SE, a leading exporter of vegetable oils.Like most of the foreign investors, SALIC was already present in Ukraine. While more foreign companies are showing interest in Ukraine, when it comes to the crunch, it is still rare for new investors to come in. One exception was the purchase of Ukraine&#x2019;s third-largest mobile operator Lifecell and service provider Datagroup-Volia by French billionaire Xavier Niel&#x2019;s company NJJ Capital, who merged the two companies under a new entity Datagroup-Volia-Lifecell. The total value of the deal was over $600 million. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation on Oct. 10 announced they would provide $435 million to finance the merged company. &#x201C;It is the largest M&amp;A deal over the last decade,&#x201D; said Boroday, adding that including all capital expenditures the deal will amount to $1.5 billion. &#x201C;We would like to see more deals of this magnitude and scale. Hopefully, this would signal to other investors in the market that the time to invest and do major deals is not waiting until the war is over but deploying (capital) now,&#x201D; he added. Lifecell signboard is visible on the facade of the building in Lviv, Ukraine on Dec. 15, 2023. (Mykola Tys/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Ukrainian innovation and technology companies attracted the most funding from foreign investors with six deals totaling $290 million. The average value was $48 million, with IT unicorn Creatio&#x2019;s $200 million funding round bringing in the most of all M&amp;As in the first nine months of the year. &#x201C;This confirms market faith in the stability of Ukraine&#x2019;s IT sector which has been able to demonstrate resilience with minimal disruptions even during wartime, owing to this sector&#x2019;s potential for remote work and thus the ability to maintain operations even with a decentralized workforce,&#x201D; KPMG said. Ukrainian companies are also increasingly investing money abroad, which KPMG believes could continue in the future. Outbound activity has risen to an all-time high since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic with 10 deals totaling $55 million as Ukrainians seek to diversify and pursue opportunities internationally. Outbound M&amp;As extend yonder the EU&#x2019;s borders, with Ukrainian IT firm Intellias acquiring UK-based IT consultancy NorthLink Digital in August and U.S.-based digital health company C2 Solutions in April. Ukraine&#x2019;s private energy giant DTEK, owned by the country&#x2019;s richest man Rinat Akhmetov, conducted the largest disclosed outbound deal valued at $32.4 million with Polish renewable energy company Columbus Energy. The company, which has suffered heavily from Russia&#x2019;s attacks on energy infrastructure, announced it had acquired a 133-megawatt battery storage project in March after an agreement with Columbus. It&#x2019;s DTEK&#x2019;s breakthrough deal into the Polish renewables market as the company looks towards a green future in line with the EU. &#xA0; A worker outside a thermal power plant, extensively damaged after a Russian missile attack, at an undisclosed location, in Ukraine, on April 12, 2024. (Andrew Kravchenko/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Domestic investmentsAt home, domestic deals made up 44% of the overall volume of M&amp;As but only contributed 18% of the deal volume. KPMG believes this could be down to the lack of transparency of domestic transactions, with only 25% of deal values disclosed. A clearer picture is expected at the end of the year. The largest disclosed sale was the privatization of Kyiv&#x2019;s Hotel Ukraina, which was sold to Ola Fine LLC owned by e-sports tycoon and Stalker game series owner Maxim Krippa for $59.5 million.Since the full war, Ukraine has amped up its privatization efforts to raise money for the state budget, with Krippa&#x2019;s purchase the largest privatization case during the first nine months of the year. This was surpassed in October by the sale of the state-owned UMCC-Titanium, one of the world&#x2019;s largest titanium producers, to Cemin Ukraine for $96 million. Agriculture has also seen significant attention from private Ukrainian companies. The biggest deal saw MHP SE acquire a 100% stake in Ukrainian Meat Farm LLC for $15.1 million. More deals are expected on the horizon following Ukraine&#x2019;s land-market reforms at the start of the year which &#x201C;continues to unlock private investment potential in Ukrainian agriculture,&#x201D; KPMG said.	https://kyivindependent.com/not-waiting-until-the-war-is-over-foreign-investment-keeps-growing-in-ukraine/	2024-10-22T11:18:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/463465872_27237238975923867_5734064406440266094_n.jpg
Zelensky signs decree to liquidate medical examination commissions amid corruption scandal	President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 22 issued a decree to liquidate medical examination commissions for determining the severity of disabilities by Dec. 31. The decree was released after a meeting of the National Security and Defense Council (NSDC), which on Oct. 22 discussed violations at medical examination commissions and the fraudulent acquisition of disability status by officials through corruption schemes. Obtaining disability status through medical examination commissions allows evading military service and receiving a higher pension, among other social benefits. According to the decree, working groups will be set up to verify certificates of disability issued by medical examination commissions within three months. If any violations are found, the certificates must be annulled. Starting from Oct. 22, pension payments for officials with disabilities should be inspected within one week. In a month, a new bill will be drafted to change the system of calculating pension payments to officials, the decree read. A plan to digitalize all stages of the medical examination commission should also be developed within two weeks. Meanwhile, the procedure for former officials with disabilities crossing the state border will be reviewed within a month. Following the NSDC meeting, Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) head Vasyl Maliuk said that the SBU had exposed corruption schemes at medical examination commissions in 2024, resulting in the cancellation of 4,106 fake disability status certificates. Maliuk added that 64 officials at medical examination commissions have been charged with committing crimes, while another nine suspects have been convicted. Corruption schemes at medical examination commissions linked to draft evasion have been reported in Rivne, Mykolaiv, Khmelnytskyi, and Kharkiv oblasts. Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin submitted his resignation on Oct. 22 following the reports of prosecutors illegally obtaining disability status.	https://kyivindependent.com/medical-examination-commissions-for-determining-severity-of-disability-to-be-eliminated-at-end-of-2024/	2024-10-22T10:54:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/2d5925e5-8c30-4c7a-be1b-26e21cd3fe9f.jpeg
North Korea has sent pilots to Russia to join its war in Ukraine, Newsweek reports	North Korea has dispatched pilots who can fly Russian warplanes to join the war in Ukraine, Newsweek reported on Oct. 22, citing South Korean television network TV Chosun. Moscow is planning to involve Pyongyang in the full-scale war against Ukraine in the coming months, with around 10,000 North Korean soldiers being prepared to join the Russian army, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said earlier in October that the first group of 2,600 soldiers would be deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. North Korea denied sending troops to join Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, calling the recent reports &quot;groundless rumors.&quot; A government official in South Korea claimed that North Korea had sent fighter pilots to Vladivostok, a city in Russia&apos;s Far East, ahead of the first deployment of its ground troops on Oct. 8, according to TV Chosun. The report said that this move could mean further training of pilots on Russian combat aircraft. If the report is confirmed, Russia will become the first country where North Korean pilots will be stationed outside their country since the Vietnam War. They also previously participated in combat operations in Syria and Egypt during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. A Western official told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15 that 10,000 North Korean soldiers had already been sent to Russia. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine&#x2019;s HUR military intelligence service, put the number at 11,000 and said they would be &quot;ready to fight&quot; by Nov. 1. A video purportedly showing them at a military training camp inside Russia has also surfaced online. Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened military cooperation as Russia seeks arms and other support in its full-scale war against Ukraine. North Korea has also been supplying Russia with ballistic missiles and vast quantities of artillery shells.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-has-sent-pilots-to-russia-to-join-its-war-in-ukraine-media-reports/	2024-10-22T09:46:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157615883.jpg
MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak: Developments in Ukraine’s parliament on economic reforms, international obligations — Issue 78	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 78 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief&#x201D; newsletter, covering events from Oct. 14- Oct. 20, 2024. The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. The president signed the draft law on customs reform. On Oct. 17, President Volodymyr Zelensky signed draft law #6490-d on the full restart of the State Customs Service. Key provisions of the draft law, in particular those regarding new procedures to select the service&apos;s head, will come into force from Oct. 31. The draft law on tax increase hasn&#x2019;t been signed yet. On Oct. 15, the speaker of the parliament signed draft law #11416-d on tax increase and sent it to the President&apos;s Office for signing. The draft law was considered as urgent by the office. However, the President still hasn&#x2019;t signed it yet. As we reported in Issue 77, one key amendment which included all major suggestions from the Tax Committee was rejected during the voting, in particular, the norm which enables the draft law to come into force retrospectively from Oct. 1. For example, it seems that the increase of military levy will be applied only after the draft law is signed and published, which will decrease expected revenues from its adoption. Next week parliament will consider the draft law on the accounting chamber reform. Next meetings of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine are scheduled for the week starting Oct. 28. Among the issues in the agenda the parliament will consider are the 2025 State Budget and draft law #10044-d on the restart of the accounting chamber of Ukraine. The competition for new members of the Bureau of Economic Security Civil Oversight Council has begun. To participate in the competition to the new bureau&apos;s Civil Oversight Council, CSOs had to nominate their candidates and submit their documents from Oct. 14-18. New members will be selected by online voting which will take place from Oct. 24&#x2013;Oct. 27. The results have to be announced and published on the bureau&apos;s official website on Oct. 28. The president signed three draft laws from the World Bank requirements. On Oxt. 17, the president signed among others draft law #5819 on regulating rating agencies, draft law #11474 on privatization of the state banks via Prozorro.Sale platform, and draft law #11063-d on the State Agrarian Register (the latter is also an obligation under the Ukraine Facility). All three were required by the World Bank for receiving further financial support. The Committee on Economic Development is finalizing the new draft law on public procurements. On Monday, the Committee on Economic Development has to finalize the text of draft law #11520 on public procurements for the second and final reading. The committee must send the draft law for the revision of the European Commission immediately.	https://kyivindependent.com/mp-yaroslav-zhelezniak-developments-in-ukraines-parliament-on-economic-reforms-international-obligations-issue-78/	2024-10-22T08:01:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Zelensky-Oct-16.jpeg
Ukraine's Prosecutor General Kostin resigns	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin submitted his resignation on Oct. 22 amid reports of prosecutors illegally obtaining disability status. Kostin&apos;s resignation comes after a National Security and Defense Council meeting headed by President Volodymyr Zelensky. During the meeting, the &quot;immoral situation&quot; with the fake disabilities of prosecutors was discussed, and &quot;many shameful facts of abuse&quot; were revealed, according to Kostin. &quot;I am grateful to the president of Ukraine and Ukraine&apos;s Verkhovna Rada for their trust. But in this situation, I believe it is right for me to resign from the post of prosecutor general,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-prosecutor-general-kostin-resigns/	2024-10-22T07:34:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/kostin.jpeg
Torn apart by infighting, without a plan, what comes next for Russia’s opposition?	When Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny died in an Arctic penal colony in February 2024, the country&#x2019;s liberal dissidents vowed to carry on their mission: to end the rule of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Eight months on, however, and Russia&#x2019;s opposition is bitterly divided, with little to no vision of how to carry on the promised fight. Their grievances resonate far beyond the negotiating table. In September, the Navalny-linked Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) accused fellow dissident Leonid Nevzlin of orchestrating a violent hammer attack on its former CEO, Leonid Volkov, on the streets of Vilnius. Nevzlin denies the claims. The accusations tore through the already tattered relationship between the FBK and the opposition circles to which Nevzlin belongs, headed by exiled oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky &#x2013; so much so that Khodorkovsky accused Navalny&#x2019;s allies of &#x201C;waging a campaign&#x201D; to discredit him. The FBK, meanwhile, faces allegations of its own. Opposition activist Maxim Kats released a two-hour video on Oct. 1 accusing the group of rehabilitating the reputations of two Russian businessmen accused of fraud by accepting their donations. The FBK is yet to comment on the investigation in-depth, saying it will instead release a more detailed response after its own analysis of Kats&#x2019; documents. &#x201C;We will have to do this at the expense of our real work,&#x201D; FBK chairwoman Maria Pevchikh complained on X. &#x201C;Time that should be spent on matters that are actually important will have to be spent on this.&#x201D; Both episodes capture a snapshot of the issues that face Russia&#x2019;s opposition: open suspicion or outright hostility between rival groups, and a lack of agreement on what the movement&#x2019;s key goals should be. But with no solution on the horizon - and Moscow&#x2019;s war machine continually on the march &#x2013; what comes next for Russia&#x2019;s opposition in exile? Infighting is nothing new for Russia&#x2019;s liberal opposition. Many of the most divisive splits are generational: politicians who were active in the 1990s, such as Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Garry Kasparov, find themselves adrift from younger activists, such as the leaders of the FBK. There are key differences in political vision and policies. &#x201C;What I think Khodorkovsky and others want (for Russia) is a far slower, gradual change,&#x201D; says Stephen Hall, assistant professor in Russian and Post-Soviet Politics at the University of Bath. It&#x2019;s harder to get a clear image of the FBK&#x2019;s plans for the Russia of the future: the group has not released a detailed roadmap, despite making an effort to sound willing to embrace a more drastic shift.

(Saul Loeb / AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;With the FBK, there is this idea of talking about corruption so that there will be mass protests, and that these will radically change Russia,&#x201D; Hall says. This tactic led the organization into exile with little success in stirring dissent at home. Such differences can very quickly become deeply personal in Russian political circles. Since the 1990s, oppositionists have rightfully feared infiltration by the security services, creating an atmosphere of mistrust and suspicion rather than good faith. It is an atmosphere that government agents have only sought to intensify. In August, a suspected Russian agent, Pablo Gonz&#xE1;lez, was returned to Russia following a major prisoner exchange. Gonz&#xE1;lez, whose actual name was Pavel Rubtsov, has successfully infiltrated the Russian opposition, building both friendships and romantic relationships with members of the group. Russian democracy also remains centered on people, rather than institutions, groups, or parties. Disagreements can be viewed as personal attacks rather than political or social discourse. &#x201C;Ultimately, it&#x2019;s the product of the weaknesses within Russian democracy itself, in as much as you have people who can&apos;t build institutions. Things become very personalized around key figures who are vying for these little shards of daylight in a very dark forest,&#x201D; says Luke March, professor in Soviet and Post-Soviet Politics at the University of Edinburgh. &#x201C;You still have this revolutionary culture of strong leaders with their small organizations.&#x201D; Even after his demise, Navalny remains at the epicenter of the news:a flare of books and literature have already been in the works following his life and death. Navalny&#x2019;s posthumous memoir, Patriot, was published on Oct. 22, with excerpts from the book shared with a number of media outlets from the U.S. and Europe.

(Olga Maltseva / AFP via Getty Images)Yet among those alive, no one has seemed capable or willing to pick up Navalny&#x2019;s torch. &quot;The death of Navalny left a chasm within the Russian opposition because there is no one with the same gravitas. Khodorkovsky is a former oligarch: there were some very dark parts in his history. Gary Kasparov is a very intelligent man, but not very good at election,&quot; says Hall. &quot;Even within the FBK, Leonid Volkov and Maria Pevchikh seem to lead in a kind of duopoly, but there isn&apos;t one that stands out.&quot; As democracy and civil society have disintegrated further in Russia, and small organizations have already dwindled, this problem of over-personalization has only become more acute. &#x201C;Organizations that aren&apos;t running for the electorate are insulated from the pragmatism that they need,&#x201D; says March. &#x201C;They focus very much on that (ideological) purity: it feeds a more conspiratorial mindset.&#x201D; Some had hoped that the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine would compel rival groups to work together. Yet, as the stakes have become higher, divides have become more ingrained. As Western organizations choose to dedicate greater support to Ukrainian causes, some Russian groups have seen a drop in resources &#x2013; an immediate source of tension between those competing for funding. The war has also highlighted issues that the Russian opposition has long considered particularly sensitive or divisive: namely, Russia&#x2019;s imperial legacy, still ingrained in the mindset of many of the country&#x2019;s leading liberal lights. &#x201C;Ukraine is one of the biggest issues that divides the Russian opposition because, while formally speaking they&apos;re all anti-war, will that involve a bigger critique of what Russia has been doing (in colonizing neighboring countries) for decades?&#x201D; says March. &#xA0;&#x201C;Russian colonialism is one of the thorniest issues for the opposition. But arguably they can&#x2019;t just park that in the current environment.&#x201D; Navalny&#x2019;s FBK and his widow, Yulia Navalnaya, have been repeatedly criticized for their dismissive take on decolonization; Navalny himself triggered controversy by saying that Crimea &quot;is not a sausage sandwich that can be returned to someone.&quot; Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian journalist freed as part of the exchange that saw Gonz&#xE1;lez go the other way, took to the stage a few days after his release and called for the decrease of sanctions on his country, calling them &#x201C;extremely unfair.&#x201D; &quot;Navalny had his own history of Russian imperialism, and that&apos;s if we&apos;re being nice about it, &quot; says Hall. &#x201C;Like many Russian liberals, when it comes to Ukraine, they aren&apos;t liberal any longer.&quot; It is difficult for politicians in exile to remain relevant in their home countries. Disunity and division have only added to the obstacles faced by Russia&#x2019;s opposition, robbing them of coherency, clarity, and charisma. They have been unable to act as a real political force in Russia &#x2013; something that, for now, seems unlikely to change. Yet there are other paths open to opposition groups that wish to weaken the Putin regime, either individually or as a collective. Most immediate are the challenges of supporting those Russians who have either fled abroad to escape persecution or to avoid mobilization. This growing diaspora will need organizations to work with governments to iron out issues such as visas, work, access to banking, and wider integration. Opposition groups abroad already work in these areas, notably the Anti-War Committee of Russia and its Ark project. These pragmatic, &#x201C;bread and butter issues&#x201D; are also an easy starting point for organizations that may have a fraught relationship to start working together more closely, says March. There is also the task of breaking the Kremlin&#x2019;s media monopoly: a skill at which groups such as the FBK and their tongue-in-cheek, YouTube-friendly style, have already proven themselves particularly adept. &#x201C;Navalny spoke a different language that was much less focused on the abstract of Putin&apos;s evil but on the things that were interesting to Russians in terms of grassroots corruption.

Where is your money going?&#x201D; says March. &#x201C;It was less focused on high principles and more on the pragmatism of how you actually gain support and highlight the problems in Russian society.&#x201D; There are also more challenging tasks, such as forging a vision of Russia&#x2019;s long-term future.

(Johannes Simon/Getty Images)Even here, certain elements are more practical than ideological. Both Western organizations and Russian oppositionists can play an important role in training the next generation of democratically minded lawyers, civil servants, journalists, and politicians, says Hall. &#x201C;There needs to be a preparedness for the future, and that includes training those who can change Russia&#x2019;s institutions - the parliament, the Federation Council &#x2013; and actually make them what they should be rather than what Putin has turned them into.&#x201D; A more in-depth vision of Russia&#x2019;s future will be a more difficult task. While organizations such as the Anti-War Committee of Russia and the Russian Action Committee, co-founded by Garry Kasparov and Mikhail Khodorkovsky, do meet regularly, some major opposition players &#x2013; notably the FBK &#x2013; are not at the table. While this continues, there can be no unified vision of what a democratic Russia could be. &quot;The opposition has to come up with a coherent set of ideas,&quot; says Hall. &#x201C;Putin is human, and therefore, he will die &#x2013; and hopefully soon. Until that happens, there&apos;s no point in spending all this time procrastinating or fighting. There needs to be a plan for what comes next &#x2013; one that the Russian elites can buy into, if necessary.&#x201D; Such unity matters not only as a blueprint for the future but also as a message for Russians today. &#x201C;A united opposition would make it so much harder for the security services and for the presidential administration to emphasize that repeated message to Russians: that there is only Putin,&#x201D; says Hall. &#x201C;It would give hope.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/torn-apart-by-infighting-without-a-plan-what-comes-next-for-russias-opposition/	2024-10-22T07:28:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2091828783.jpg
G7 plans to keep Russian assets frozen after war in Ukraine ends, Nikkei reports	The Group of Seven (G7) plans to keep Russian assets frozen even after the end of Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, the Japanese news agency Nikkei reported on Oct. 22, citing its undisclosed sources from G7. European countries hold roughly two-thirds of the $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets immobilized after the outbreak of the full-scale war. While hesitant to confiscate the assets outright, the European Union has devised a plan to use windfall profits to fund Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction and defense needs. G7 leaders will issue a joint statement in October saying that &quot;Russia&apos;s sovereign assets will remain immobilized until Russia ends its aggression and pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine,&quot; according to the draft prepared by this year&apos;s chair, Italy. The bloc will also guarantee a $50 billion loan to Kyiv, Nikkei reported, citing the draft. During the June G7 summit in Italy, G7 leaders publicly confirmed a deal to provide Ukraine with the $50 billion loan by the end of the year. The loan will be repaid using interest from billions in frozen Russian assets. In September, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a loan of up to 35 billion euros ($39 billion) as part of that pledge. In October, the World Bank&apos;s executive committee approved the creation of a new fund to help fulfill G7&apos;s $50 billion loan. Estimates of the damage that Russia&apos;s aggression has caused to Ukrainian infrastructure over the past decade vary. The World Bank said in February that it could be as high as $486 billion. Under the G7 plan, profits from Russia&apos;s frozen assets will gradually be used to repay the loan. EU officials have said that the loan would be &quot;undesignated&quot; and &quot;untargeted,&quot; allowing Ukraine maximum flexibility in how it spends the funds. The EU expects to start distributing the money early next year.	https://kyivindependent.com/g7-plans-to-keep-russian-assets-frozen-after-russias-war-in-ukraine-ends-media-says/	2024-10-22T07:09:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156738800.jpg
Germany 'skeptical' about Ukraine's NATO membership, Zelensky says	Germany still &quot;has skepticism&quot; about Ukraine joining NATO, fearing Russia&apos;s reaction, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Oct. 21. Speaking at a meeting attended by the Kyiv Independent, Zelensky stressed that a majority of NATO countries have reached a consensus on an invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance, which would be granted within the internationally recognized borders of the country. &quot;Today we see support from France. We understand that the British will support us, and we believe that the Italians will support us,&quot; the president said. But he added the position among several countries including Germany remains restrained. &quot;But still, the U.S. will have an impact on this... We believe that they are consolidating their thoughts on NATO and this has an impact on, for example, Hungary and Slovakia,&quot; Zelensky added. The president voiced hope that Washington&apos;s reaction would be &quot;more positive&quot; after the U.S. presidential election in early November. Talking to journalists, Zelensky did not rule out that &quot;some partners&quot; may think about Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO in exchange for the occupied territories. &quot;We are not discussing this,&quot; he said. &quot;This invitation, I believe, does not depend on Russia&apos;s opinion. When some other partners are convinced that they are stronger than Russia, then we will have a positive outcome in this sense.&quot; The invitation to NATO membership is also extended to internationally recognized borders of the country, Zelensky said. &quot;This is not just an invitation, but an invitation while the war is still ongoing. And what kind of accession, how it will take place, how long &#x2014; this is the next step, diplomacy.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s remarks come days after he publicly unveiled his five-point victory plan, which includes Kyiv&apos;s invitation to join NATO placed at the top of the list. U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said that the alliance does not currently have such plans. Kyiv submitted its application to join in September 2022, and in July 2024 the alliance affirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership&quot; &#x2014; though Ukraine has not received any definitive news about its future accession. According to the information obtained by the Kyiv Independent, Kyiv had planned to ask for NATO membership within the months, not years.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-not-discussing-nato-membership-in-exchange-for-the-occupied-territories-zelensky-says/	2024-10-22T06:26:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2150217708.jpeg
Opinion: Shifting the paradigm in Ukraine	Last month, a Russian missile blew apart an apartment building in the center of Lviv. I sent a message to a friend who lives there: Was everyone okay? &#x201C;Yes, we were lucky,&#x201D; he replied. &#x201C;Our friends who live just next to us, a young woman and her three daughters, are dead.&#x201D; Then I saw the footage. The neighbor, Yaroslav Bazylevych, his face cut and bloodied, watched as the bodies of that young woman &#x2013; his wife &#x2013; and their three daughters were pulled from the rubble. A photo from the funeral, showing Bazylevych staring into the open coffins, should enter the pantheon of iconic images of atrocity: the little Jewish boy with his arms raised in the Warsaw Ghetto, the naked Vietnamese girl fleeing her village after a napalm attack, the body of the two-year-old Syrian boy washed ashore on a Turkish beach. The hypersonic Kinzhal missile that killed the Bazylevych family, like the one that hit the Okhmatdyt children&#x2019;s hospital in Kyiv two months earlier, was fired from deep inside Russia. The launch sites are not a mystery; the Ukrainians know where they are. The missile that killed Yaroslav&#x2019;s wife, Evgeniya, and their daughters was launched from a MiG-31K aircraft in Russia&#x2019;s Tula Oblast. The aircraft took off from Savasleyka, a military air base about 300 kilometers (186 miles) east of Moscow, about 866 kilometers (538 miles) from the Ukrainian border, and 1,386 kilometers (861 miles) from Lviv. By car, the drive would take over 20 hours; a Kinzhal can travel that far in as little as seven minutes. But Ukrainians are not permitted to use the weapons Americans have provided to destroy the launching sites; they have to wait for the missiles to arrive. Everyone knows it is absurd, but it is not their decision. It is the decision of the U.S. government, and in fact of one man, President Joe Biden &#x2013; a good man with the right moral instincts, but a man who has been unable to see beyond the paradigm of &#x201C;escalation avoidance,&#x201D; long after that paradigm has become perverse and deadly. Admittedly, it is hard to extricate ourselves from long-held paradigms and see the world anew, all the more so as we age. We are always attached to the previous reality. War and revolution rupture time, throw it &#x201C;out of joint&#x201D; in Hamlet&#x2019;s words. Suddenly, a state of affairs that has prevailed for years or decades ceases, as if in an instant, to exist. Yet the thinking shaped by it can linger long afterward. This is especially poignant in Biden&#x2019;s case. In October 1991, he chaired the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, presiding over hearings to investigate law professor Anita Hill&#x2019;s claims that Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her a decade earlier. Thomas&#x2019;s defenders portrayed Hill as a rebuffed single woman prone to chasing male attention. John Doggett, a Texas attorney and friend of Thomas called to testify on Thomas&#x2019;s behalf, recounted that Hill had once expressed disappointment when he canceled a dinner date. &#x201C;Ms. Hill&#x2019;s fantasies about my sexual interest in her were an indication of the fact that she was having a problem with being rejected by men she was attracted to,&#x201D; Doggett told the committee. Biden responded to Doggett&#x2019;s claim: &#x201C;It seems to me that is a true leap in faith or ego, one of the two.&#x201D; Yaroslav Bazylevch visits the graves of his wife and their three daughters, who were killed in a Russian missile attack on Sept. 4, 2024, that hit their home, at a cemetery in Lviv, Ukraine, on Sept. 15, 2024. (Oksana Parafeniuk/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)Emergency and rescue personnel clear rubble from the Okhmadyt children&apos;s hospital, destroyed in a Russian missile attack amid Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, in Kyiv, Ukraine, on July 8, 2024. (Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)Listening over the radio 33 years ago, I understood that Biden believed Hill and cringed at her humiliation. He took care to emphasize that she had not wanted to come forward. Still, Biden lacked the daring to step outside of his assigned role, to see the situation anew. But the inclination to avoid radicalism can have radical consequences. Biden&#x2019;s moral sensibility was respectable, but his failure to take a bold step had dire repercussions, for it allowed Thomas to take his seat on the Court. The moral bankruptcy of today&#x2019;s Supreme Court, in which Thomas plays a key role, has left Americans facing an aspiring dictator whom that Court, in a decision supported by Thomas, has now granted near-total impunity. It is not ill will or callousness that has defined Biden&#x2019;s career, but rather a lack of daring. Indeed, that seems to be the tragic flaw of a fundamentally decent man. In a world where narcissistic psychopaths exert a disproportionate influence in shaping events, Biden stands out for his empathy. But that is not &#x2013; and cannot be &#x2013; enough. History moves through an interaction between the structural conditions in which we find ourselves and the choices we make. Sometimes the role of individual choice emerges with particular acuity, for better or worse: Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x2019;s &#x201C;bold experimentation&#x201D; to overcome the Great Depression, for example, or Neville Chamberlain&#x2019;s appeasement of Adolf Hitler at Munich. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s refusal of the U.S. government&#x2019;s offer to evacuate him as Russian tanks rumbled toward Kyiv was another such moment. While the Kremlin&#x2019;s assassins hunted him in the capital, Zelensky walked out onto the city streets at night and recorded a selfie video. &#x201C;The president is here,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We are all here.&#x201D; Suddenly, nothing was as expected. Ukraine would not fall in three days, as Vladimir Putin had predicted, and be reduced to a Belarus-style Russian protectorate. A massive land war on the European continent, considered impossible before Feb. 24, 2022, had suddenly become the great fact of the early 21st century. This unlearning to unsee is Biden&#x2019;s task today. He is no longer young, and his time remaining in power is short. Yet he still can &#x2013; and should &#x2013; take a risk, shift the paradigm, and embrace the possibilities, and the demands, of a new historical moment. &#x201C;The miracle that saves the world ... from its normal, &#x2018;natural&#x2019; ruin,&#x201D; Hannah Arendt wrote, &#x201C;is ultimately the fact of natality.&#x201D; By natality, she meant not only the literal birth of a new generation, but also the new beginnings arising from humans&#x2019; capacity to act. For Arendt, action possesses the quality of birth, its consequences unpredictable by its very nature. In Ukraine, inaction &#x2013; the refusal to permit Ukraine&#x2019;s government to act in self-defense &#x2013; possesses the quality of death. Editor&#x2019;s Note: Copyright, Project Syndicate.

North Korea helping Russia in Ukraine 'for money,' Zelensky says	North Korea is supporting Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine for financial gain, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Oct. 21. Speaking at a meeting attended by the Kyiv Independent, Zelensky was asked about Pyongyang&apos;s increasing support for Moscow, which in recent days is reported to have developed from just weapons to boots on the ground. &quot;I think it&apos;s because of the money,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;I think North Korea is very poor, so they will send their people to the front.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un signed a security agreement, pledging to provide aid to one another if either is attacked. With Russia&apos;s military stocks running low and domestic production capacity simultaneously hampered by Western sanctions, North Korea has been shaping up to be Russia&apos;s leading weapons supplier. Moscow has reportedly received extensive military packages from Pyongyang, including ballistic missiles and millions of artillery shells. The financial details of the arrangement have not been made public, but in exchange for ammunition already supplied, Russia has reportedly provided North Korea with technology to help it deploy spy satellites as well as tanks and aircraft. Zelensky also said he believed North Korean troops would struggle to operate effectively while fighting for Russia. &quot;We located officers and technical personnel in temporarily occupied territories (of Ukraine),&quot; he said, adding, &quot;I think they sent the officers because their officers would understand what was going on first, and then send the contingent. &quot;But how do you manage them? How do you command them? I&apos;m talking about language. I think these are serious difficulties.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-helping-russia-in-ukraine-for-money-zelensky-says/	2024-10-22T05:50:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1734340621.jpg
US to provide Ukraine with another $800 million to boost domestic long-range capabilities, Zelensky says	The U.S. is planning to provide Ukraine with an aid package of $700-800 million for the domestic production of long-range capabilities, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Oct. 21. On the same day, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a new $400 million military aid package during a surprise visit to Kyiv. In addition, it was also announced that Washington is preparing to provide $800 million for the production of Ukrainian drones. &quot;Then there should be also the next tranche in the amount of $700-800 million,&quot; Zelensky said at a meeting attended by the Kyiv Independent, in reference to the package designated for long-range capabilities. Zelensky and Austin also discussed how much of the $8 billion in aid the U.S. announced in late September could be dedicated to Ukrainian production by the end of the year. Domestically produced long-range weapons are key to Ukraine&apos;s defense strategy, as Western partners refuse to authorize deep strikes in Russia with foreign-made missiles. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Oct. 21 that Ukraine has invested more than $4 billion in its defense production and urged international partners to invest further, recalling the recent successes of Ukrainian specialists in drone manufacturing. Despite Zelensky&apos;s appeal to Washington during his recent White House visit, the U.S. has not yet altered its policy on long-range strikes.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-provide-ukraine-with-another-800-million-to-boost-ukraines-long-range-production-zelensky-says/	2024-10-22T05:09:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178138302.jpg
Putin hosts BRICS summit in Russia but Brazilian and Cuban leaders cancel attendance	The leaders of Brazil and Cuba both canceled their attendance at this week&apos;s BRICS summit, being hosted in Russia by President Vladimir Putin. &quot;Regrettably, as it became known today, President of Brazil Lula da Silva and President of Cuba Miguel Diaz-Canel will not be able to come due to unforeseen circumstances,&quot; Kremlin presidential aide Yury Ushakov said in comments reported by Russian state media on Oct. 21. Lula, 78, is reported to have suffered a minor brain hemorrhage after falling at his home at the weekend, and will instead appear by videoconference. Diaz-Canel is suffering &quot;serious energy problems,&quot; Russian state media reported. BRICS, composed of Russia, China, India, Brazil, and other nations, is a group of emerging economies often portrayed as a counterweight to the Western-led world. Four new members &#x2013; Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates &#x2013; joined the international organization at the start of 2024. This marked the group&apos;s first expansion since December 2010, when South Africa became a member. Cuba has requested to join the BRICS group as a &quot;partner country&quot; in an official letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a Cuban Foreign Ministry official said on Oct. 8. With Russia increasingly isolated on the international stage, and forced to turn to countries like North Korea for support, Moscow is hoping the summit can send a message to Western nations that it can still yield some clout. The Kremlin described the three-day meeting which began on Oct. 22 as one of the &quot;largest-scale foreign policy events ever&quot; in Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-hosts-brics-summit-in-russia-but-brazilian-and-cuban-leaders-cancel-attendance/	2024-10-22T04:28:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178339508.jpg
As the Baltics raise the alarm about Russia, Washington still not listening	For Zygimantas Pavilionis, a member of the Lithuanian parliament, history is repeating itself: The Kremlin&#x2019;s military sights are set on Europe beyond Ukraine and the U.S. is not listening to warnings from the Baltics. &#x201C;In Europe, they listen to the Baltics, but in America, they are so arrogant that they don&#x2019;t listen,&#x201D; Pavilionis said. On top of its all-out war in Ukraine, Russia has recently driven up tensions around the NATO-allied Baltic states &#x2014; Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania &#x2014; as well as nearby Finland and Sweden, raising concerns about its intentions in the area. Over the past year, Russia has made several moves in the Baltic Sea area, including GPS jamming, removing boundary markers in the Narva River that separates Russia and Estonia, and a brief attempt to change the maritime border between Lithuania and Finland. Earlier in May, Micael Byden, the commander of the Swedish Armed Service, the military protecting NATO&#x2019;s newest member, also warned that the Kremlin may be seeking dominance over the Baltic Sea and has his eye on Sweden&#x2019;s island of Gotland. A lot has changed since the time leading up to 2014 when Russia launched its aggression against Ukraine, and when Baltic state officials say their warnings of larger Russian threats on the Trans-Atlantic community often went ignored. But despite its full-scale invasion in 2022 and recent escalations, some from the Baltics say Washington still isn&#x2019;t heeding their warnings of the threat of Russia &#x2014; one the countries know intimately after over half a century of Soviet occupation and decades of bordering modern-day Russia, making them some of Ukraine&#x2019;s strongest advocates in the U.S. capital. A member of the Lithuanian parliament, Zygimantas Pavilionis, listens to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack and the Republic of Lithuania Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius during their meeting in Washington, D.C. on Oct. 8, 2014. (Lance Cheung / USDA Photo)If they were listening, aid to Ukraine wouldn&#x2019;t have been delayed, Kyiv&#x2019;s pleas to lift a ban on Western-made long-range weapons to strike inside Russia and cripple its war machine would be granted, and NATO would consider strengthening its eastern flank, Pavilionis said. U.S. presidential elections on the horizon also make the stakes especially high as they could see Donald Trump return to the White House. The former Republican president, espousing isolationist views, has criticized aid to Ukraine, repeatedly flaunted his relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and called into question NATO&#x2019;s existence. Trump&apos;s vice presidential pick JD Vance has said he &#x201C;doesn&#x2019;t care&#x201D; what happens to Ukraine, leading to fears that a Republican-led U.S. would mean the worst for Ukraine and the entire region. Only one Republican skeptical of the then-stalled Ukraine aid package of $61 billion took a meeting back in February with a Baltic delegation, according to Pavilionis, which is why he both then and now calls for members of Congress to &#x201C;wake up.&#x201D; &#x201C;(American isolation) would mean war in the Baltics,&#x201D; he told the Kyiv Independent. While war may be unlikely in the region&#x2019;s direct future, the three Baltic nations are not sitting idle. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania lead NATO in defense spending. As a percent of gross domestic product, Estonia is set to spend 3.43% on defense in 2024, well above NATO&#x2019;s 2% guidelines and America&#x2019;s 2.7%,a drop from 5.7% during the Cold War. Just recently, Lithuania said it had blocked and fortified a bridge over the Nieman River linking it to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. Their knowledge of the threats, which also include cyber attacks in addition to maritime menaces, is also behind a lot of their lobbying in support of Ukraine. Numerous lawmakers who spoke with the Kyiv Independent said there is bipartisan consensus that the Baltic states remain some of the most effective voices in Washington to further support for Ukraine. &#x201C;&#x200B;&#x200B;There&apos;s probably no better advocates for Ukraine than the Baltic countries,&#x201D; Republican Congressman Don Bacon, who is co-chair of the House Baltics Caucus, said. Their support &#x2014; and understanding of the risks &#x2014; is evidenced in disproportionately high levels of military support for Ukraine. The Baltic states, despite having a collective smaller population than New York City, were among the top four donors in aid to Ukraine this summer. As some Republicans continually criticize European countries for not spending an equal percentage of their budget on aid for Ukraine as the U.S., it&#x2019;s appreciated how the Baltics have punched above their weight in support of Kyiv, according to a Senate foreign policy aide who spoke on condition of anonymity. Convincing its Western allies to act decisively in supporting Ukraine is another story. &#x201C;It takes a lot of explaining to connect the dots,&#x201D; Estonia&#x2019;s U.S. Ambassador Kristjan Prikk told the Kyiv Independent, describing how he explains to U.S. officials that Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine isn&#x2019;t just about Putin wanting Kyiv, it&#x2019;s also his undermining of the U.S. &#x201C;Quite often our role has been to spell it out and explain to people what&#x2019;s at stake.&#x201D; When Ambassador Prikk served in Washington over a decade ago during the three years preceding Crimea&#x2019;s annexation, explaining Russia&#x2019;s threat to the West was immensely difficult, he said. At times, his warnings of Russia&#x2019;s threats to European security would even go ignored. Today, I met with Speakers of the Baltic states to discuss ongoing challenges that face our countries. We discussed the importance of deterring threats like China, Russia, and Iran, and we noted the importance of viable U.S. energy production for the Baltics and the risks posed&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/RUNAV6DKOx &#x201C;(Baltic countries) have a good story to tell and people to a degree are listening,&#x201D; Jeremy Shapiro, a U.S. foreign policy expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said. In February when Ukraine&#x2019;s $61 billion aid package was held up in Washington, parliamentary speakers from each Baltic nation met with Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, delivering a message that Russia will act on any sign that Western support of Ukraine is waning. Johnson then received a letter in April shortly before allowing the aid to pass from his Baltic counterparts requesting he deliver the &#x201C;indispensable aid&#x201D; to Ukraine. &#x201C;Supporting Ukraine is an investment in our collective secure future,&#x201D; the letter said. Even though Prikk says the Baltics are increasingly listened to because of the region&apos;s &#x201C;credibility&#x201D; given Russian drones exploding in Latvia and other examples of the region&#x2019;s proximity to Russia, it&#x2019;s a matter of constant work. With the Middle East&#x2019;s widening war competing for U.S. resources, the elongated presence of Cold War-era Washington officials, and a swift news cycle atop a condensed attention span, explaining Russia&#x2019;s threat to Washington is like cycling, you can&#x2019;t stop pedaling, he said. &#xA0; With a few hundred American troops based indefinitely in the Baltics and $228 million in U.S. aid approved for the region&#x2019;s three countries this year, some would like to see a larger NATO military presence in the region as tensions between Russia and NATO escalate. Congressman Bacon said the U.S. needs to do more to build up air defenses in the Baltics, likely meaning more American troops in the region. &#xA0; &#x201C;We need to be there for deterrence,&#x201D; Rep. Bacon, a former Air Force general said. &#x201C;I know the Russians know we&#x2019;re there and that&#x2019;s what counts.&#x201D; Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, a member of the Senate&#x2019;s Baltic Freedom Caucus, said Russia ought to know that the U.S. is ready to defend its obligations to fellow NATO members.

(Jonathan Nackstrand / AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;I think it&#x2019;s very necessary that the U.S. makes it very clear that we consider the Baltics in our sphere and not Russia&#x2019;s.&#x201D; &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve got to spend more on our own defense because we&#x2019;re relatively weak now,&#x201D; Sen. Grassley said, referencing American preparedness in the face of adversarial hostility. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t feel very secure.&#x201D; Disagreements remain on the Hill over whether more U.S. troops should be in the Baltics near Russia&#x2019;s westernmost NATO border. The worry is that more U.S. personnel near Russia, whether troops in the Baltics or diplomats in Ukraine, could trigger Russian escalation. The Baltic states likely want a permanent presence of a few border divisions, according to Ivo Daalder, a former U.S. Ambassador to NATO. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s just not going to happen because those (troops,) if they&#x2019;re deployed there, then they can&#x2019;t be used anywhere else,&#x201D; Daalder said. Ambassador Prikk says the region isn&#x2019;t asking for more U.S. troops, just military training and a defense plan. Even if the region was demanding more troops, there are still worries that the Baltics don&#x2019;t fully have Washington&#x2019;s ear. It&#x2019;s not that the U.S. isn&#x2019;t listening, Daalder said, it&#x2019;s that the realities of being a global ally an ocean away come into play when Russia&#x2019;s threat is singular and existential for the Baltics but not for the U.S., despite being critical.

(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)The spectre of Trump A potential second Donald Trump presidency throws America&#x2019;s commitment to the alliances into question, not least because of the former president&#x2019;s critical remarks of the alliance in the past. One of the reasons Pavillionis believes the Baltics need to escalate their diplomatic efforts in Washington is because of the influence he says autocratic countries are having amongst Republicans. In September, the U.S. State Department said the Russian state-run media outlet RT was actively working with Russian intelligence to spread propaganda in the U.S. partly in an attempt to push U.S. viewers toward voting for Trump. Particularly concerning for the Baltics is the pro-Russian messaging of far-right American commentator Tucker Carlson, and his success in retaining the ear of elected Republicans. Sen. Grassley said he &#x201C;worries a lot&#x201D; about the praise some members of his party have for Carlson and Putin, but added that it is partly a messaging issue that many Americans are unaware that billions of American aid for Ukraine is spent in the U.S. Ambassador Prikk said that navigating pro-Kremlin sentiment amongst the right in Washington has been an unusual challenge. And the last time Pavillionis was in Washington in early 2024, every third Republican on the Hill was speaking like Putin, he said. &#x201C;We have to take care of this infiltration of autocracies inside the Republican party.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/no-better-advocate-for-ukraine-the-baltics-crucial-presence-in-washington/	2024-10-22T03:01:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2105323303.jpg
North Korea denies sending troops to join Russia's war in Ukraine, dismisses 'groundless rumors'	North Korea has claimed reports it has sent soldiers to fight with Russia against Ukraine are &quot;groundless rumors,&quot; the South Korean Yonhap news agency reported on Oct. 22, citing a North Korean representative to the United Nations. The statement is Pyongyang&apos;s first public reaction to multiple reports of such a deployment from Kyiv and Seoul. Moscow is planning to involve Pyongyang in the full-scale war against Ukraine in the coming months, with around 10,000 North Korean soldiers being prepared to join the Russian army, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said that the first group of 2,600 soldiers will be deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. Speaking at the U.N. meeting, the North Korean representative described relations between Pyongyang and Moscow as &quot;legitimate, friendly and cooperative.&quot; &quot;As for the so-called military cooperation with Russia, my delegation does not feel any need for comment on such groundless stereotyped rumors aimed at smearing the image of the DPRK,&quot; he said. The Kremlin on Oct. 21 called such reports &quot;contradictory&quot; but did not confirm nor deny the claims. A Western official told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15 that 10,000 North Korean soliders had already been sent to Russia. Lt. General Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine&#x2019;s HUR military intelligence service, put the number at 11,000 and said they&apos;d be &quot;ready to fight&quot; by Nov. 1. A video purportedly showing them at a military training camp inside Russia has also surfaced online. Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened military cooperation as Russia seeks arms and other support in its full-scale war against Ukraine. North Korea has been supplying Russia with ballistic missiles and vast quantities of artillery shells.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-denies-alleged-troops-sending-to-fight-russian-war-as-groundless-rumors/	2024-10-22T03:00:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157775748.jpg
UK to provide Ukraine with $2.9 billion military loan, to be repaid with proceeds from frozen Russian assets	London will provide Ukraine with a loan worth &#xA3;2.26 billion ($2.9 billion) backed by profits from frozen Russian assets, the U.K. government announced on Oct. 22. The funds are the U.K.&apos;s contribution to the Group of Seven (G7)&apos;s initiative to provide Kyiv with a $50 billion loan by the end of the year, which will be repaid using interest from billions in frozen Russian assets. The U.K.&apos;s loan will be allocated to Ukraine&apos;s military spendings. Kyiv will be able to invest in key equipment to fight Russia, such as artillery, air defense, and wider equipment support, the statement read. &quot;This new money is in Britain&#x2019;s national interest because the front line of our defense &#x2014; the defense of our democracy and shared values &#x2014; is in the Ukrainian trenches,&quot; said Rachel Reeves, U.K. chancellor of the exchequer. &quot;A safe and secure Ukraine is a safe and secure United Kingdom.&quot; British Defense Minister John Healey said the money could be used to help Kyiv develop long-range drones capable of travelling further than some missiles. The aid comes on top of the UK&apos;s existing 3 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) a year assistance for Ukraine. European countries hold roughly two-thirds of the $300 billion Russian sovereign assets immobilized after the outbreak of the full-scale war. While hesitant to confiscate the assets outright, the EU devised a plan to use windfall profits to fund Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction and defense needs. Under the G7 plan, profits from Russia&apos;s frozen assets will gradually be used to repay the multi-billion-euro loan. EU officials said that the 35 billion loan will be &quot;undesignated&quot; and &quot;untargeted,&quot; allowing Ukraine maximum flexibility in how it spends the funds. The EU expects to start distributing the money early next year.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-to-provide-ukraine-with-2-9-billion-loan-from-frozen-russian-assets/	2024-10-22T02:18:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179782562.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 10, injure 42 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed 10 people and injured 42 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Oct. 22. Ukrainian forces downed 46 out of 60 Shahed-type drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Ten more drones were &quot;lost,&quot; three others flew back towards Russia and one drone entered Belarusian airspace, it added. Houses came under attack in the city of Sumy. Three people, including a child, were killed, and one more person suffered injuries, according to local authorities. A Russian missile attack on the city of Zaporizhzhia killed three people and injured 19, including an eight-year-old girl, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. Russian forces carried out another missile strike on the city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, injuring six people, Governor Serhii Lysak said.

Seoul considering sending military personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops, Yonhap reports	South Korea is considering sending a team of personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops that Russia may involve in its full-scale war, Yonhap agency reported on Oct. 22, citing an unnamed government source. &quot;There is a possibility that personnel will be sent to Ukraine to monitor the tactics and combat capabilities of North Korean special forces dispatched in support of Russia,&quot; the source said. Moscow is planning to involve Pyongyang in the full-scale war against Ukraine in the coming months, with around 10,000 North Korean soldiers being prepared to join the Russian army, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said that the first group of 2,600 soldiers will be deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. He said that close to 11,000 North Korean troops are in Russia and will be &quot;ready to fight&quot; in Ukraine by Nov. 1. If deployed, a South Korean team may include military personnel from intelligence units who will be able to analyze Pyongyang&apos;s warfare tactics or participate in the interrogations of captured North Koreans. The government is also reportedly considering providing Ukraine with armed support. Up until now, Seoul has only provided humanitarian aid to Kyiv, though it has been reported the country has indirectly supplied artillery shells via the U.S. In June, South Korea said it would reconsider its policy of not directly supplying Ukraine with weapons after Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un signed a security agreement in Pyongyang. &quot;While watching signs of North Korea-Russia military cooperation, the response measures will be taken in steps,&quot; the source told Yonhap. The source said that sending defensive weapons will be prioritized over lethal arms, adding that even if lethal weapons are provided, South Korea will first consider providing them to Kyiv indirectly. While the U.S. has been cautious about confirming Russia&apos;s plans to engage Pyongyang in its war, South Korea is sounding the alarm, calling such a scenario a &#xA0;&quot;grave security threat&quot; to the international community. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it believes North Korea will deploy four brigades totaling 12,000 soldiers to the war in Ukraine, including 1,500 special forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/seoul-considering-sending-military-personnel-to-ukraine-to/	2024-10-22T00:48:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2167507180.jpg
Ukrainian drones target Russian alcohol plants overnight, local authorities claim	Ukrainian drones attacked four plants in Tula, Tambov and Voronezh oblasts in Russia overnight on Oct. 22, Russian local authorities claimed. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed its air defenses destroyed 11 drones over Bryansk Oblast, three over Belgorod Oblast, two over Kursk Oblast, one over Tula Oblast, and one over Orel Oblast. In Tambov Oblast, a Ukrainian drone reportedly set to fire the Biokhim distillery in the town of Rasskazovo, according to Governor Maxim Egorov. According to the Biokhim website, it produces &quot;products of strategic importance for the state,&quot; in particular ethanol, a solvent which is used in the manufacture of a wide range of products including explosives. Two more distilleries came under the attack in the settlements of Efremov and Luzhkovsky in Tula Oblast overnight, Governor Dmitry Milyaev said. Alexander Gusev, Voronezh Oblast governor, claimed a drone attack caused a minor fire on one of the floors of an industrial enterprise. No casualties have reported. The Ukrainian military has not yet commented on the reports, which cannot be verified independently. Ukraine has carried out a number of strikes against airbases and other military facilities in an effort to weaken the more powerful Russian Air Force and curb Moscow&apos;s ability to launch devastating aerial attacks against Ukrainian cities.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-attack-4-plants-in-russia-overnight-local-authorities-claim/	2024-10-21T23:14:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-22-085130.png
Polish officials seek access to classified sections of Ukraine's victory plan	Warsaw is seeking to review the classified additions to Ukraine&apos;s victory plan recently presented by President Volodymyr Zelensky, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Wladyslaw Teofil Bartoszewsk said in an interview on Oct. 21. Zelensky&apos;s victory plan, presented on October 17, includes five main points and three confidential appendices. During the presentation of the victory plan, Zelensky mentioned that the complete text would remain confidential and only select partners crucial for its execution would be granted access to the classified appendices of specific sections. Bartoszewsk noted that Poland is not among the countries that received full details of the plan, and emphasized Poland&apos;s significant military support to Ukraine. &quot;We provided Ukraine with military aid in the most crucial way, because when Germany was talking about sending them helmets, we sent 320 tanks. So our contribution was obviously significant, especially at the beginning when it was most needed,&quot; he said. The victory plan consists of the following requests: an invitation to join NATO, a defense aspect, deterrence of Russian aggression, economic growth and cooperation, and post-war security architecture. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Oct. 18 that Ukraine&apos;s victory plan will be reassessed after the upcoming U.S. presidential election. At the same time, Tusk emphasized that Poland&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership has not changed. &quot;We stand in solidarity with Ukraine on this issue,&quot; he said. Poland has been one of the strongest supporters of Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, providing billions of dollars in military, economic, and humanitarian aid and hosting millions of Ukrainian refugees.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-officials-seek-access-to-classified-sections-of-ukraines-victory-plan/	2024-10-21T22:23:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/poland.jpeg
General Staff: Russia has lost 681,580 troops since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 681,580 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 22.

Russia executed 2 Ukrainian POWs in Donetsk Oblast, prosecutors say	Russian soldiers executed two captured Ukrainian soldiers near Selydove in Donetsk Oblast, the Donetsk regional prosecutor&apos;s office reported on Oct. 21. On Oct. 18, during an attack on Ukrainian positions, Russian forces captured the two unarmed soldiers, forced them face down, and later shot them at close range. This execution is a violation of the Geneva Conventions and is considered a serious international crime. Ukrainian law enforcement has launched a criminal investigation under the laws of war. Ukrainian Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets has informed the UN and Red Cross about the incident in order to document it. Russian forces have executed at least 102 Ukrainian prisoners of war since 2022, Lubinets said in an interview on Oct. 18, citing data from the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. According to Lubinets, the actual number of such cases is likely much higher since it is difficult to document Russian war crimes without supporting evidence such as videos of the executions. There have been multiple reports of executions of Ukrainian POWs by Russian soldiers over this year. Videos and photos resurfaced on social media with evidence of the crimes, including drone footage showing the shooting of the POWs as they surrendered to Russian troops, as well as videos and photos with bodies of Ukrainian soldiers suggesting torture and violent death in captivity.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-executed-2-ukrainian-pows-in-donetsk-oblast-prosecutors-say/	2024-10-21T20:05:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2153450598.jpg
Cargo plane shot down in Sudan, Russian nationals possibly on board	Sudan&apos;s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) claimed to have shot down a cargo plane in Darfur, with speculation that Russian nationals may have been on board. The aircraft, identified as an Ilyushin Il-76 from Kyrgyzstan, had documents connecting it to a UAE-based company. The RSF released mobile phone footage showing identity documents recovered from the crash site, including a Russian passport. Additionally, the RSF stated that &quot;foreign mercenaries&quot; were killed in the operation, further implying the potential presence of Russian citizens. This connection raises concerns about the involvement of Russian mercenaries or private contractors in Sudan&#x2019;s ongoing conflict, which has seen various international actors entangled. Russia maintains a strong presence in African countries like Sudan through Wagner and other entities, propping up authoritarian governments, fueling destabilization, and extracting resources to fund its war against Ukraine. Claims have previously appeared in other media publications that Ukrainian special forces took part in operations in Sudan and are responsible for strikes against Wagner-backed militants. According to the WSJ, Sudan&apos;s de facto ruler, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, appealed to Ukraine for assistance in the summer of 2023 while besieged by rebel forces. Kyiv responded positively in order to curb Russia&apos;s influence abroad, but also because &quot;Burhan had been quietly supplying Kyiv with weapons since shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022,&quot; the outlet wrote. Russia&#x2019;s Embassy in Khartoum issued a statement confirming that its diplomats were investigating the incident in Sudan&#x2019;s Malha region, near the border with Chad.	https://kyivindependent.com/cargo-plane-shot-down-in-sudan-russian-nationals-possibly-on-board/	2024-10-21T19:21:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/sudan.jpg
US to provide Ukraine with $800 million for drone production, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Oct. 21 that the U.S. will provide $800 million in military aid to Ukraine, aimed at funding the production of drones to strengthen the country&apos;s defense capabilities. &quot;Every meeting with our partners involves discussions about the defense-industrial complex,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address. &quot;We need Ukraine to be able to defend its sovereignty and independence regardless of any political threats in the world.&quot; The announcement followed Zelensky&apos;s meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Kyiv, where the Pentagon chief announced a new $400 million military assistance package for Ukraine. The package included HIMARS air defense systems and 155 mm artillery ammunition, among other weapons and training equipment. &quot;This is especially important before the onset of winter, as Russia has not given up its intentions to plunge Ukraine into cold and darkness. Your unwavering support is not just a gesture of friendship. It&apos;s a powerful symbol of the shared values that bind our nations together,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said at an event a Kyiv Independent journalist attended. Since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in early 2022, the United States has committed more than $60 billion in security assistance to Ukraine. Despite the U.S. support, Russian forces keep grinding on in the country&apos;s east while Ukraine braces for fresh strikes against the energy grid with the coming winter.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-provide-ukraine-800-million-for-drone-production-zelensky-says/	2024-10-21T15:25:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2174412815.jpg
Opinion: Money-laundering watchdog FATF needs to blacklist Russia	The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) meets tomorrow, Oct. 22, and is expected to once again debate Russia&#x2019;s blacklisting. That Russia, a clear state sponsor of terrorism, hasn&#x2019;t been ousted from an intergovernmental body that sets global standards to combat terrorist financing, money laundering, and related financial crimes, is incredible. It&#x2019;s remarkable that Russia isn&#x2019;t already on the FATF blacklist alongside North Korea and Iran. Just ask the CEO of Germany&#x2019;s biggest arms manufacturer Rheinmetall, whom Russia plotted to kill, or consider the Russian bomb plots thwarted by the postal services in the U.K. and Germany. MI5 and its German equivalent have also recently flagged Russia&#x2019;s growing terrorist threat. Russia continues to violate sanctions and encourages others to do the same. As reported by the Financial Times and others, shadow fleets are circumventing sanctions with Russia&#x2019;s support. It would be a fitting move for U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration to finally push for Russia&#x2019;s FATF blacklisting. Should a Donald Trump presidency follow, keeping Russia on the blacklist could serve as a bargaining chip for future peace negotiations over Ukraine. In recent months, the mounting pressure on Russia&#x2019;s economy has been evident. The ruble is approaching 100 to the dollar, inflation is rising, and Russia&#x2019;s Central Bank has had to hike interest rates to stabilize the currency and counter inflation. These economic challenges partially reflect new sanctions, including measures against the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) and tightened secondary sanctions that make it harder for third-party countries, like China and India, to trade with Russia. Shipping containers sit on rail trailers at a logistics hug on the outskirts of Moscow, Russia, on April 9, 2024. (Natalia Kolesnikova / AFP via Getty Images)Tightening sanctions on Russia serves several important purposes. First, it weakens Russia&#x2019;s economy, making it harder and more expensive to regenerate its military and wage war on Ukraine. Second, while sanctions were initially imposed in response to Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, it&#x2019;s now clear that Russia poses a broader threat to Western interests. Russian President Vladimir Putin believes he&#x2019;s at war with the West and NATO, so it&apos;s in NATO&#x2019;s interest to weaken Russia&#x2019;s military capabilities. Sanctions help degrade that threat. Third, sanctions damage the Russian economy, giving Ukraine and the West leverage in future negotiations. For this reason, FATF blacklisting Russia makes strategic sense for the West. It&#x2019;s notable that FATF was originally created to counter the threat of Islamist terrorism after 9/11. One argument against blacklisting Russia is that it plays a key role in countering these same radical Islamist groups. However, recent events suggest Russia now poses a greater terrorist threat to the West than these organizations. Moreover, its alliances with Iran and North Korea &#x2013; now supplying 10,000 troops to fight in Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine &#x2013; underscore its alignment with other FATF-blacklisted states. Blacklisting Russia would send a clear message: aligning with Iran and North Korea to wage war against Ukraine and attack Western interests has consequences. A potential counterargument is that blacklisting Russia could reduce its cooperation in fighting Islamist extremism, a key reason FATF was founded. However, given the growing threat Russia faces from these same radical groups, as seen in recent attacks, including the Moscow theater incident, Russia&#x2019;s cooperation in counterterrorism efforts is unlikely to wane. It remains in Russia&#x2019;s interest to address these threats, and FATF blacklisting shouldn&#x2019;t change that.

Is NATO ready for war with Russia?	The launch of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 confronted the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) with a new geopolitical reality. Described as &quot;braindead&quot; by French President Emmanuel Macron only a few years prior, the alliance woke up to a threat previously thought consigned to the past: a full-out conventional land war on the European continent. Military officials have since churned out warnings of a resurgent Russian threat to NATO, saying allies must be ready in three, five, or eight years&apos; time. &#x201C;The Russian Federation has become a problem for the world order, for democracy. In fact, it is a war of Russia with the democratic world. It is not (just) a war with Ukraine,&#x201D; Romanian Defense Chief Gheorghita Vlad said in February of this year. After decades of fighting insurgents rather than armies, underfunded European forces still sobering up from the post-Cold War &quot;peace dividend years,&quot; and the shadow of Donald Trump&apos;s return to the White House, NATO&apos;s readiness for such a clash lies in doubt. &quot;NATO could not defeat Russia given its current capabilities without incurring significant cost in terms of casualties, damage, and temporary loss of territorial sovereignty,&#x201D; Gordon B. Davis, a senior fellow at the CEPA think tank and NATO&#x2019;s former deputy assistant secretary general, told the Kyiv Independent. Collectively, the 32 members of NATO can field a powerful, and modern fighting force, but &#x2014; its European contingent at least &#x2014; faces ammunition shortages, a fragmented defense industry, and insufficient air defense coverage. Then there is the question of unity and the will of Western societies to make sacrifices in a costly and prolonged war.

(Armend Nimani/AFP via Getty Images)NATO&#x2019;s capabilities Despite years-long decline, NATO can still pack a punch. In many aspects, even the European part of the alliance can outgun Russian forces, boasting a larger number of active duty personnel, advanced long-range capabilities like Taurus or Storm Shadow/SCALP missiles, and larger, more modern airpower. While NATO, not counting the U.S., has roughly 1.9 million active personnel, 2,400 combat-ready aircraft, and 6,650 tanks as of 2024, Russia has estimated 1.1 million active troops, 1,370 aircraft, and 2,000 tanks, according to the Center of Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). NATO also grew stronger with the accession of two new members &#x2014; Sweden and Finland &#x2014; adding two well-trained and interoperable militaries to the alliance and a more than 1,300-kilometer-long border for Russia to defend. &quot;There is still an overwhelming ability by NATO for death and destruction in terms of long-range fire, anything launched from the fleet of F-35 (advanced jet fighters), for example,&quot; Ed Arnold, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), said in comments for the Kyiv Independent. &quot;If they (Russia) fought how they fight now, in Ukraine, against a NATO force, they would be destroyed pretty quickly,&quot; he added, referring to Russia&apos;s high-mortality &quot;meat grinder Storm-Z tactics.&quot; Davis agrees that NATO would have the upper hand but wouldn&apos;t avoid losses. &quot;Assuming a conventional fight only, NATO would outfight Russia&apos;s air forces and naval fleets, although its bombers, drones, and submarines would succeed in striking NATO territory and forces,&quot; he said, adding the alliance &quot;would defeat Russian ground forces, but not necessarily prevent them from taking territory.&quot; Many NATO planners have named the Baltic states as the most vulnerable to attack, situated as they are next to Russia, its staunch ally Belarus, and the heavily militarized Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. In the event of a war between NATO and Russia, Russian and Belarusian forces linking up across the 40-kilometer-wide Suwalki Gap would cut off the only land route to all three Baltic states. Russia, NATO countries, and the Baltic Sea Region. (Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)Shock-and-awe vs. the long haulNATO might have the upper hand in a quick, &quot;shock-and-awe&quot; war where their superior firepower would quickly decimate Russian forces. The question is: would this be that kind of war? The Kremlin is certainly aware of its weaknesses and strengths in comparison to its chief geopolitical opponent. As the first year of the full-scale invasion demonstrated, the Russian state and society were ready to absorb initial losses and reconstitute for a long fight. &quot;The majority of the combat experience within NATO forces are from Afghanistan, which is very, very different&#x2026; from what might happen in a potential war between NATO and Russia,&quot; Arnold said. Roughly 3,600 coalition troops were killed in 20 years of the Afghanistan War. The estimates of Russian troops killed in two and half years in Ukraine were placed at around 200,000. Western societies are likely to be much more sensitive to casualties, and their factories and armories have proven unprepared even for a sustained support of Ukraine. Insiders told the Kyiv Independent last month that part of the reason behind slow-paced U.S. aid packages is empty Pentagon shelves. The EU was forced to postpone its promised 1 million shells to Ukraine due to the &quot;lamentable state of the defense industry.&quot; Alternatively, using &quot;salami-tactics&quot; &#x2014; gradually using a series of small military actions rather than one big one &#x2014; would test allied unity and courage to respond. Rather than marching to Berlin or Paris, Russia could try to grab and hold a chunk of the Baltics and ward off any counterattack with the threats of a massive &#x2014; even nuclear &#x2014; escalation. Nuclear weaponry remains the wild card and the Kremlin is not shy about threatening the use of its atomic arsenal. A recent change to its doctrine lowered the threshold for a nuclear response in a gesture obviously aimed at Western powers.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)NATO catching upIn a written comment for the Kyiv Independent, Davis provided a &quot;shopping list&quot; of NATO&apos;s main weak spots: &quot;Integrated air and missile defense, persistent surveillance, long to short range strike systems (including drones), land-based electronic warfare, ground munitions inventories (e.g., artillery, mortars, antitank), and anti-submarine warfare capabilities.&quot; &quot;NATO has exquisite capabilities in all these areas, but not in sufficient numbers, breadth, and depth in terms of stocks and defense production capabilities.&quot; One key reason behind these deficiencies was the peace dividend Europe enjoyed in the post-Cold War period. Believing that the specter of a full-blown conflict with Moscow was gone, European nations cut average defense funding from 2.4% to 1.6% of GDP between 1990 and 2000. Twenty-four countries abandoned conscription in the roughly two decades after 1990. While land forces of (West) Germany, Italy, France, and the U.K. could field 215, 135, 106, and 94 battalions in 1990, these numbers shrank to 33, 46, 44, and 50 by 2020, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) says. The U.S. scaled down its presence as well. The alliance started slowly waking up to new realities in 2014 in the wake of the Russian war against Ukraine, the occupation of Crimea and the war in Donbas. &quot;The good news is (that) since 2014, starting with the Wales conference and every summit thereafter, we have truly increased the readiness of NATO,&quot; said retired U.S General Philip M. Breedlove, the supreme allied commander Europe (SACEUR) in 2013-16, in an interview with the Kyiv Independent. Asked whether NATO is ready to face Russia today, Breedlove said: &quot;No, but we&apos;re way more ready than we were in 2014.&quot; The Wales summit saw the establishment of the Readiness Action Plan to bolster collective defense and deterrence. Two years later, NATO launched the Enhanced Forward Presence, deploying initially four, and later eight allied battalions along the alliance&apos;s eastern flank. By 2022, SACEUR commanded 40,000 troops from the Baltic to the Black Sea, in addition to tens of thousands of host countries&apos; troops, and some 100,000 U.S. soldiers in Europe. The preparations kicked into higher gear after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Madrid summit in 2022 saw allies adopt the NATO Force Model, a three-tier defense plan that would make 300,000 troops ready within a month, and half a million within half a year. This was in addition to increased aerial and naval readiness and exercises, such as this year&apos;s Steadfast Defender, which, with 90,000 troops, was the largest NATO drill since the Cold War.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Fresh funds began flowing into defense. Whereas in 2014, only three allies met the 2% of GDP threshold, this number grew to 19 &#x2014; including the newcomer Sweden &#x2014; &#xA0;a decade later. Some members are even calling for raising the benchmark. Since the start of the Russian war against Ukraine 10 years ago, the European allies have increased their defense spending by roughly a third to a total of $380 billion, CSIS&apos;s analysis said. In comparison, Russia&apos;s defense expenditures for the same year were around $110 billion, with much of it allocated to the war against Ukraine. While impressive on paper, many of these plans face challenges with implementation. The efforts to have 300,000 troops on a one-month standby are complicated by disputes between national and NATO authorities, and low enlistment levels in member countries. IISS analysts pointed out that only a few European militaries actually grew in size in the past decade. Despite new investments in defense production, Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson told the Kyiv Independent earlier this year that it could take up to two years before artillery shell manufacturing is at the desired level. The aforementioned long-range missiles, like Storm Shadow or Taurus, are not even currently in production, and the former is being used up in Ukraine, Arnold noted. In the end, the execution of these ambitious plans rests on the unity and political willingness of individual members, which may very well be NATO&apos;s Achilles&apos; heel. The possible return of Donald Trump to the White House is increasing concerns across European capitals. The former president famously said that he would encourage Russia to do &quot;whatever the hell it wants&quot; to those members who do not meet the defense spending benchmark. On the other side of the Atlantic, Hungary has been repeatedly breaking the allied consensus, and one official even recently implied that Budapest would not resist a Russian invasion. Populist and radical political forces are growing in Slovakia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and elsewhere. Fatigue is also growing across the alliance, even though the current sacrifices mostly entail only small fractions of budgets and retired military hardware. &quot;The main weakness of NATO at the moment is that people just aren&apos;t on the same page with this (Russian) threat,&quot; Arnold said, underscoring the differences between countries in NATO&apos;s north and east on the one hand and the western part on the other. Another great uncertainty is the result of Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. Russian forces are currently fully engaged and have suffered heavy losses. Their capability to reconstitute depends on when and how the war ends. The &quot;how&quot; is the most decisive factor. Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said earlier this month that If NATO wants to avoid a clash with Russian forces, it needs to help Ukraine win. &quot;Should Russia be able to rebuild, restructure, and adapt its defense capabilities, and training and doctrine, following a conflict with Ukraine, it would pose an even greater threat to NATO,&quot; Davis warned.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-vs-russia-how-ready-is-the-alliance-for-war/	2024-10-21T12:18:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166545608.jpg
US has provided Ukraine with over $64 billion in military aid since start of full-scale invasion, Umerov says	The U.S. government has provided Ukraine with military aid worth over $64 billion since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Oct. 21 at the joint press briefing with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The Pentagon chief arrived in Kyiv earlier in the day in a surprise visit to discuss further support for Ukraine as the uncertain U.S. presidential election looms. During his visit, Austin also announced a new $400 million military assistance package for Ukraine, which included HIMARS air defense systems and 155 mm artillery ammunition, among other weapons and training equipment. &quot;This is especially important before the onset of winter, as Russia has not given up its intentions to plunge Ukraine into cold and darkness. Your unwavering support is not just a gesture of friendship. It&apos;s a powerful symbol of the shared values that bind our nations together,&quot; Umerov said at an event attended by a Kyiv Independent journalist. Umerov mentioned that Ukraine has invested more than $4 billion in its defense production and urged international partners to invest further, recalling the recent successes of Ukrainian specialists in drone manufacturing. &quot;Our drones have become a real threat to the enemy. They can hit targets thousands of kilometers away and have already destroyed more than 200 military facilities in Russia. Ukraine&apos;s defense production potential might approach $20 billion,&quot; the minister said. Umerov also highlighted Austin&apos;s role in the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, also known as a Ramstein-format meeting. &quot;You have played a major role in bringing the free world together and coordinating the cooperation of more than 50 democracies to confront the threat posed by tyranny, to fight what seems now a coalition of dictatorships,&quot; Umerov added. Austin, in his turn, said that every time he is back at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, where the group was forged, he finds it &quot;moving to look around that long table and to see in human form the global indignation over (Vladimir) Putin&apos;s crimes.&quot; The U.S. Defense Secretary also mentioned that, as a percentage of GDP, a &quot;dozen U.S. allies and partners&quot; now provide more security assistance to Ukraine than the U.S. does. The group members have provided over $1 billion in direct security assistance to Ukraine in total, he added. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group is the U.S.-led group consisting of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The last Ramstein meeting on Sept. 6 was the group&apos;s 24th gathering since its establishment in April 2022. The next meeting will be conducted in a virtual setting in November.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-has-provided-ukraine-with-over-64-billion-in-military-aid-since-start-of-full-scale-invasion-umerov-says/	2024-10-21T12:00:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2169448523.jpg
Only death awaits them' – We asked 5 Ukrainian soldiers about North Korean troops fighting for Russia	Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine is on the verge of escalating dramatically, with multiple reports, intelligence assessments, and a video suggesting North Korean troops could soon be fighting alongside Kremlin forces. While Pyongyang has long supplied Moscow with weaponry, the deployment of boots on the ground would mark a significant development that has raised alarm bells in capitals around the world. In the latest development on Oct. 21, South Korea summoned the Russian ambassador in Seoul, Georgy Zinoviev, and called for the &quot;immediate withdrawal of North Korean troops and (to) stop relevant cooperation&quot; with Pyongyang. While not confirming the deployment, Washington has said it is &quot;concerned&quot; about the reports. On Oct. 18, U.S. Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Michael R. Turner appealed to President Joe Biden to respond immediately. Moscow has neither confirmed nor denied reports. &quot;We see a lot of contradictory information,&quot; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Russian media, the state-controlled news agency Interfax reported. &quot;The South Koreans say one thing, and then the Pentagon says that they have no confirmation, so there is a lot of contradictory information. So that&apos;s probably how it should be approached.&quot; Despite Peskov&apos;s vague statements, there is plenty of evidence to suggest North Korean troops are already in Russia training to partake in the Kremlin&apos;s war in Ukraine in some capacity. A Western official told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15 that 10,000 had already been sent. Lt. General Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine&#x2019;s HUR military intelligence service, put the number at 11,000 and said they&apos;d be &quot;ready to fight&quot; by Nov. 1. A video purportedly showing them at a military training camp inside Russia surfaced online.

And other people from Russia don&apos;t want to go to this war just for money; it&apos;s a very important sign. &quot;They will be very low-quality troops; they won&apos;t have experience of fighting in this war, so strategically it won&apos;t make a profound difference on the front line. &quot;If North Korea sends many more troops, again, it&apos;s a problem for them. They will have language problems. Ukraine also has experience with (foreign legion) soldiers, so we understand these difficulties. &quot;We must work with South Korea on this problem. We must create a special government program for soldiers to convince them to stop fighting and make a proposal that they can return to Korea, not to North Korea, but to South Korea. &quot;Because many people from North Korea try to run away from the regime to South Korea. This would be a really good program for them.&quot; &quot;We are already at war with one of the strongest countries. There is nothing to worry about. &quot;They shouldn&apos;t come here; only death awaits them here. Let them go AWOL (absent without official leave) straight away. This is not their war and not their country.&quot; &quot;It all depends on how many of them there will be. I&apos;ve heard that some have already been caught in Kursk Oblast. I don&apos;t think their quality is very high. North Korea is a country stuck somewhere in the 1950s-60s. &quot;Of course, this is bad because the more of them there are, the worse it is. (For us, it means) more work. &quot;We should influence them like everyone else through psychological operations, scattering leaflets. It&apos;s not a cure-all, but it&apos;s something even if one percent runs over to us and surrenders. &quot;On a large scale, I don&apos;t think they&apos;ll have much impact on anything.&quot; In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin (centre L) and North Korea&apos;s leader Kim Jong Un (centre R) attend a welcoming ceremony at Kim Il Sung Square in Pyongyang, North Korea on June 19, 2024. (Gavrill Grigorov/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)Petro Kyzyk, a battalion commander at the National Guard&quot;We will kill everyone who comes to our land as an occupier!&quot; &quot;Technically, Russia is fighting at the expense of its allies: Chinese drones, Iranian missiles and Shahed (drones), Chinese armored cars, North Korean missiles, ammunition&#x2026; And now soldiers. &quot;This speaks to the ridiculous problem that the &apos;second most powerful army in the world&apos; cannot defeat Ukraine, which is weak on its own and which the West is afraid to help appropriately, so it is sitting on scraps. &quot;But this also speaks to another terrible problem. The &apos;second most powerful army in the world&apos; is not just pulling what resources it can from its allies, no. It is beginning to fight in a coalition format. &quot;The West is providing little help and reacts sluggishly to the growing scale of the mess. Recent statistics showed that the average age of contract soldiers in the Russian army has reached 50 years. It was also said somewhere that the wounded were sent into battle. I believe the former and would like to believe the latter, but there is no evidence. &quot;Sign-up bonuses for joining the Russian army have increased dramatically over this year. This suggests they need to motivate people to join the army to avoid a general mobilization. &#x201C;Many &apos;experts&apos; bets are in jeopardy because many said Russia would soon run out of steam. But they have found another million-dollar secret place to draw meat from. This is scary. &quot;With another 10,000 more troops, Russia can at least not slow down much, and at most can receive a third of the personnel it needs every month. This is tangible.&quot; Additional reporting by Asami Terajima and Daria Shulzhenko.	https://kyivindependent.com/only-death-awaits-them-we-asked-5-ukrainian-soldiers-about-north-korean-troops-fighting-for-russia/	2024-10-21T11:26:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-843572642-1.jpg
Russian strikes against Pokrovsk district in Donetsk Oblast kill 3, injure 2	Russia attacked the towns of Kurakhove and Myrnohrad in the Pokrovsk district of Donetsk Oblast on Oct. 21, killing three and injuring two people, local authorities reported. The eastern front near Pokrovsk has been the scene of fierce fighting for several months and a focal point of Russia&apos;s offensive in Donetsk Oblast. The city is an important logistical hub for Ukrainian forces. The Russian strike occurred at around 3 p.m. local time in Myrnohrad, which is only seven kilometers (five miles) away from Pokrovsk. A man and a woman were killed, while another man was injured. He suffered shrapnel wounds, the acting head of the town&apos;s military administration, Yurii Tretiak, told the Kyiv Independent. Some 33 houses and outbuildings were damaged in the town. Russian troops also attacked Kurakhove, located west of Russian-occupied Donetsk and some 30 km (18 miles) from the town of Pokrovsk. One person was killed, while another one was injured. The strike damaged a five-story building, as well as an administrative building in Kurakhove, Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Earlier in the day, Ukraine&apos;s National Guard said that Russian forces are attempting to storm the Selydove sector in Donetsk Oblast, using large numbers of infantry. The town of Selydove is located some 25 kilometers (15 miles) from Kurakhove.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-strikes-against-pokrovsk-district-in-donetsk-oblast-kill-3-injure-2/	2024-10-21T11:17:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/PHOTO-2024-10-21-18-52-56-1.jpg
Opinion: Moldova's EU integration referendum hangs in the balance, highlighting the dangers of oversimplification	Moldovans headed to the polls on Oct. 20 to elect their next head of state and vote on the future of the country&#x2019;s European Union integration. With over 98% of the votes counted on Monday, the &#x201C;yes&#x201D; vote edged ahead at 50.03%, while the &#x201C;no&#x201D; camp, which had maintained a lead since the counting began, stood at 49.97%, according to results from the election commission. President Maia Sandu&#x2019;s decision to align the referendum on amending the constitution for Moldova&#x2019;s EU accession with the first round of the presidential election was a strategic political move. This alignment was approved by the parliament, where Sandu&#x2019;s Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) holds a comfortable majority. To be clear, Sandu and PAS have accomplished more for Moldova&#x2019;s EU integration than all previous governments combined, including those that claimed to be &#x201C;pro-European.&#x201D; However, when it comes to the EU and referendums, I experience anxiety, especially when they seem unnecessary. For instance, we might have had a Constitutional Treaty instead of the Treaty of Lisbon, and the U.K. might still be a member, had politicians not posed a simple yes-or-no question about a complex issue. Not only does this approach narrow the debate &#x2013; offering virtually no alternative among other presidential candidates who also support EU membership &#x2013; but it also carries significant risks, as past examples have shown. During the 2016 Moldovan presidential election, the Kremlin attempted to influence the outcome through disinformation campaigns. While this interference might have occurred regardless of the referendum, it opened an additional front in the virtual battlefield that these elections have become. Reports suggest that up to 150 million euro ($162.9 million) was allocated for social media campaigns aimed at spreading disinformation, interfering with the elections, and destabilizing the country. Additionally, investigative journalists from Ziarul de Garda uncovered that Ilan Shor &#x2013; an Israeli-born Moldovan pro-Russian oligarch and politician &#x2013; funded around 15 million euro ($16.3 million) to directly buy votes from his exile in Russia. This is a staggering sum for a country of just 2.5 million inhabitants. Moscow&#x2019;s nervousness was palpable, especially among pro-European citizens in Chisinau in the days leading up to the vote. The extremely close results, with only a small majority in favor of the referendum, have proved their concerns valid. A negative outcome would not necessarily halt the EU accession process, as the question only aims to enshrine EU membership as a constitutional goal. This change would make it more difficult for future governments to deviate from that path, but it would not render it impossible. However, as mentioned, this approach severely limited the space for discourse. There was no option to support the referendum without also supporting Sandu. The second-place candidate came from the Party of Socialists, which called for a boycott of the referendum. Their deputies also left parliament when, in March, the ruling PAS government majority endorsed a resoluti0on to continue efforts to join the EU. People cast their ballots during the 2024 Moldovan presidential election and the referendum on rapprochement with the European Union at a polling station in Hirbovat, Moldova, on Oct. 20, 2024. (Daniel Mihaliescu /AFP via Getty Images)Instead of engaging in an honest debate about the challenges and opportunities of Moldova&#x2019;s EU integration, as well as the achievements and failures of Sandu&#x2019;s presidency, voters faced a binary choice &#x2013; right or wrong &#x2013; depending on their perspectives. The only option was to counter the blatant propaganda from the pro-Russian side, such as the claim &#x2013; echoed by some EU member states and government &#x2013; that EU membership would embroil Moldova in the war the Kremlin is waging against Ukraine. What could have been discussed is that Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament approved a similar constitutional change in 2019, which may have heightened anxieties for some. A pertinent discussion should involve how Article 42.7 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), or the mutual defense clause, could be interpreted or guaranteed without NATO in a potential EU membership for Ukraine and/or Moldova. Beyond listing the usual advantages of EU membership (such as basic freedoms, no roaming fees, and flight rights), there is a notable lack of positive narratives addressing the fears and concerns of both Moldovans and EU citizens. It may help to put certain matters into perspective. Enlargement would return us to where we once were. The six Western Balkan countries, along with Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia, have a combined population of approximately 67 million &#x2013; similar to the U.K. Admittedly, these nine candidate countries have only 10% of the U.K.&apos;s GDP, but enlargement represents an opportunity for stabilizing democracies, as it has in most previous rounds of enlargement. A stable neighborhood has historically led to economic prosperity for both old and new EU members. We should stop focusing solely on the budget (which, at around 142.5 billion euro ($154.6 million), is only about 20 billion euro ($21.7 billion) higher than Austria&#x2019;s). It is evident that not everyone can receive more than they contribute. However, the net payer concept is misleading; for instance, Germany contributes 27% more than France to the EU but benefits 67% more from single market integration. While additional countries in the EU may complicate decision-making, more than 60% of votes since 2010 have been unanimous, even though qualified majority voting (QMV) would have sufficed, according to the German think tank SWP. They have suggested extending QMV without a treaty revision, but perhaps that should only be Plan B. Why not be bold and reintegrate deepening and widening? The complicated journey from the Treaty of Nice to Lisbon &#x2013; including the aforementioned negative referenda in 2005 and an additional one in 2008 &#x2013; took 65 months. The longest successful enlargement negotiations took 77 months, averaging 42.4 months. Therefore, the goal of EU membership for Moldova by 2030, as announced by the government, is achievable with the right ambition and determination from all parties involved. Typically, a referendum on EU membership occurs at the end of this process, not at the beginning. Perhaps there will be more room for discussion leading up to the second round of presidential elections scheduled for Nov. 3, now that referendum anxiety has lessened, albeit by a narrow margin. Ultimately, the real &quot;referendum&quot; will be the parliamentary elections, set to take place by July 2025 at the latest. It is not the president but the government that will determine Moldova&apos;s direction. Until then, there will be plenty of room for anxiety on all sides &#x2013; but there is also still hope for Moldova&apos;s future within the EU.

Ukraine war latest: US announces new defense aid package for Ukraine worth $400 million	Key developments on Oct. 21: The U.S. has allocated a new military assistance package for Ukraine worth $400 million, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced during his to Kyiv on Oct. 21, Ukrinform reported. Later in the day, the Pentagon said in its press release that the recent package included HIMARS air defense systems, tube-launched, optically tracked, and wire-guided (TOW) missiles, M113 armored personnel carriers, Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems, and ammunition for high-mobility artillery. Washington also pledged to provide Kyiv with 155 mm and 105 mm artillery ammunition, as well as 60 mm, 81 mm, and 120 mm mortar systems and rounds, among other weapons and training equipment. The Pentagon chief arrived in Kyiv in a surprise visit to discuss further support for Ukraine as the uncertain U.S. presidential election looms. There are fears that if Republican nominee and ex-President Donald Trump beats his Democratic challenger, Vice President Kamala Harris, he might withdraw or scale down U.S. support for Ukraine and force the country toward painful concessions. Washington has allocated some $175 billion in assistance to Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, including roughly $70 billion worth of arms and military equipment. Despite the U.S. support, Russian forces keep grinding on in the country&apos;s east while Ukraine braces for fresh strikes against the energy grid with the coming winter. Russian authorities detained 18 North Korean soldiers who abandoned their positions in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, a military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 21. Moscow&apos;s ally Pyongyang is preparing to deploy around 11,000 soldiers to help Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine early next month, Kyiv said, adding that some had already arrived. Suspilne earlier reported on Oct. 15, citing unnamed intelligence officials, that eighteen North Korean soldiers had deserted their positions in Russian regions near the Ukrainian border. Hromadske also reported, citing a military intelligence source, that around 40 North Korean soldiers had arrived in Russia to exchange skills with their Russian counterparts. After the training, the 18 North Korean soldiers that were detained had been left in a forest in Kursk Oblast without food and instructions for several days, leading to them abandon their post to find the Russian command on Oct. 14. Two days later, the missing soldiers were found and detained by Russian authorities roughly 60 kilometers (almost 40 miles) from their original position, Hromadske wrote. South Korea confirmed the transfer of North Korean military personnel to Russia, calling it a &quot;grave security threat.&quot; U.S. Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Michael R. Turner said that such a step must constitute a &quot;red line for the United States and NATO.&quot; A video that emerged online on Oct. 18 purportedly showed North Korean soldiers in a Russian military camp receiving equipment and preparing for deployment against Ukraine. Russia and North Korea have deepened their cooperation throughout the full-scale war, with Moscow receiving extensive packages of artillery shells and ballistic missiles. The Kremlin spokesperson on Oct. 21 &#xA0;called the recent reports about the dispatch of North Korean troops to aid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine &quot;contradictory&quot; but did not confirm nor deny the claims. &quot;We see a lot of contradictory information,&quot; spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Russian media, the state-controlled news agency Interfax reported. &quot;The South Koreans say one thing, and then the Pentagon says that they have no confirmation, so there is a lot of contradictory information. So that&apos;s probably how it should be approached.&quot; The U.S. is yet to confirm the presence of the North Korean troops in Russia or Ukraine, though a senior U.S. lawmaker said such a step would mean crossing a &quot;red line&quot; and necessitate immediate action. &quot;(North Korea) is our close neighbor and partner, and we are developing relations in many spheres, which is our sovereign right,&quot; Peskov said, claiming that this cooperation is &quot;not directed against third countries.&quot; The spokesperson said questions regarding the conduct of the war should be directed toward the Defense Ministry. The recent comments signify a shift in rhetoric from earlier this month when Peskov outright dismissed the reports as &quot;fake news.&quot; Russian forces are attempting to storm the Selydove sector in Donetsk Oblast, using large numbers of infantry, Ukraine&apos;s National Guard said on Oct. 21. Selydove, with a pre-war population of nearly 21,000 people, is located 18 kilometers south (11 miles) of Pokrovsk, which has been a focal point of Russia&apos;s offensive in recent months in the Donetsk sector of the front line. According to the National Guard, Russian troops periodically conduct mechanized assaults near Selydove, involving from three to five armored vehicles. Ukrainian troops repelled 17 Russian assault attempts in the Pokrovsk sector over the past day, the statement read. The news came amid claims spread by Russian propaganda that Ukrainian and Russian troops are fighting street-to-street battles on the outskirts of Selydove. When asked by the Kyiv Independent about the situation in the area, the Ukrainian military refused to comment. Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in defending the front line, particularly in Donetsk Oblast, where Russia has consistently concentrated its offensive potential. Following Ukraine&apos;s withdrawal from Vuhledar in early October, Russian forces have been focusing their efforts against the Donetsk Oblast towns of Pokrovsk, Toretsk, and Kurakhove, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are slowly losing ground under Russian pressure. Ukrainian forces destroyed a Russian Buk-M3 air defense system overnight on Oct. 21, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. The operation was reportedly carried out by Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces together with other military units. The Buk-M3 is the latest version of the Soviet-era Buk systems family. It is a medium-range system that can intercept aerial targets, including tactical ballistic missiles, at a range of up to 65 kilometers (40 miles). The Russian anti-aircraft system was located around 60 kilometers from the front line, the General Staff said. The cost of such equipment is estimated at $40-50 million.

Alexei Navalny's widow Yulia says she will run for president if she can return to Russia	Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, told the BBC in an interview she would run for president if she is able to return to a post-Putin Russia. &#x201C;I will participate in the elections&#x2026; as a candidate&#x201D; when the time is right, Navalnaya told the BBC in an interview published on Oct. 21. Navalnaya said that she aims to &quot;bring closer and make change in the country possible&quot; without going into further details, but added that she is not &quot;a magician and does not know the secret&quot; of bringing about immediate change in Russia. &quot;If you can&apos;t do something big right away, do something small every day, and the more people do that, the sooner it will be time for change,&quot; she said. Navalnaya said her return to Moscow is &quot;unfortunately impossible&quot; as long as Russian President Vladimir Putin remains in office. She currently lives abroad and did not attend the funeral of her husband, Alexei, which took place on March 3, in fear of being arrested. In July, a court in Moscow ordered the arrest in absentia of Navalnaya on charges of &quot;participating in an extremist organization.&quot; The charges mean that if she were to return to Russia she would face jail time, similar to her late husband. Alexei Navalny returned to Russia in 2021 after being hospitalized in Germany following an attempt on his life, and was immediately detained. He died in on Feb. 16 in a penal colony in Russia after being convicted in several fabricated criminal cases as part of the Kremlin&apos;s crackdown on dissent. Leaders around the world have blamed Putin for his death. Following the death of her husband, Navalnaya entered more into the public spotlight. She has accused Putin of murdering her husband and vowed to continue Navalny&apos;s work. Navalny&apos;s memoir &quot;Patriot,&quot; compiled from the Russian opposition leader&apos;s prison diaries and edited in part by his widow, Yuliya, will be published posthumously on Oct. 22.	https://kyivindependent.com/navalnaya-wants-to-participate-in-russias-presidential-election-if-she-returns-to-country/	2024-10-21T09:04:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2147917825.jpg
Unprecedented interference' by Russia, its proxies in Moldova referendum, EU says	Moldova&apos;s referendum on joining the EU, which took place alongside elections in the country, occurred under &quot;unprecedented interference&quot; by Russia and its proxies, European Commission spokesperson Peter Stano said. &quot;This vote took place under unprecedented interference and intimidation by Russia and its proxies, aiming to destabilize the democratic processes in the Republic of Moldova,&quot; Stano said on Oct. 21 during a press briefing in Brussels. Voters were almost evenly divided on Oct. 21 on a referendum to enshrine the country&apos;s path to European Union accession in the Moldovan constitution. Preliminary results show that the pro-EU voters won by a razor-thin margin, securing 50.42% of the vote against 49.58% who voted &quot;no,&quot; the country&apos;s electoral commission said. In the presidential elections, Moldovan President Maia Sandu came first in the initial round of the election on Oct. 20 with 42% of the vote, heading for a run-off on Nov. 3. Pro-EU Sandu will face off against her main competitor, Alexandr Stoianoglo, a member of the pro-Russian Party of Socialists, who gained roughly 26% of the vote in the first round. Stano said that the EU is following the referendum and the presidential election in Moldova and will provide an &quot;official reaction&quot; once the final results of both votes are announced. The spokesperson added that attempts to disrupt the voting in Moldova lasted &quot;not weeks but months,&quot; long before Oct. 20. Stano also mentioned vote-buying and propaganda spreading efforts made by Russia and its proxies. &quot;This is an ongoing effort from Russia and its proxies &#x2014; not only in Moldova, indeed, also against our countries &#x2014; and it&apos;s a long-term fight. They don&apos;t have boundaries. We, as the European Union... respect certain principles, including the laws, but Russia and its actors and its proxies do not respect that,&quot; he said. Moldovan authorities have claimed that over $15 million in Russian funds have reportedly been funneled to over 130,000 Moldovans voters who have been instructed on how to cast their ballots in the election. Pro-Russian oligarch Ilan Shor, a Moldovan-Israeli tycoon, was accused of laundering the money and orchestrating the network despite his own political party being banned. Sandu, a pro-Western politician, has also previously accused Moscow of plotting to overthrow her government in an attempted coup. The U.S., U.K., and Canada warned of potential Russian interference in Moldova&apos;s elections in a joint statement issued on June 13.	https://kyivindependent.com/voting-in-moldova-takes-place-under-unprecedented-interference-by-russia-its-proxies-european-commission-spokesperson-says/	2024-10-21T07:52:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1205267788.jpeg
Sending North Korean troops to fight Russia's war would mean 'significant escalation,' Rutte says	The involvement of North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine would be a &quot;significant escalation,&quot; NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on Oct. 21 after talks with the South Korean president. Moscow is planning to involve Pyongyang in the full-scale war against Ukraine in the coming months, with around 10,000 North Korean soldiers being prepared to join the Russian army, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said that the first group of 2,600 soldiers will be deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. He said that close to 11,000 North Korean troops are in Russia and will be &quot;ready to fight&quot; in Ukraine by Nov. 1. &quot;North Korea sending troops to fight alongside Russia in Ukraine would mark a significant escalation,&quot; Rutte said on social media following a conversation with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, without explicitly confirming the reports. The two discussed NATO&#x2019;s close partnership with Seoul, defense industrial cooperation, and the interconnected security of the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific. &quot;Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine and the reckless military alignment between Russia and North Korea once again confirm that the security of the Indo-Pacific region and the Atlantic region are inextricably linked,&quot; Yoon said, according to the Yonhap news agency. &quot;This undermines the rules-based international order, threatening peace on the Korean Peninsula and globally, and the (South Korean) government will never stand by and let this happen.&quot; While the United States is cautious about confirming Russia&apos;s plans to engage Pyongyang in its war, South Korea is sounding the alarm, calling such a scenario a &#xA0;&quot;grave security threat&quot; to the international community. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it believes North Korea will deploy four brigades totaling 12,000 soldiers to the war in Ukraine, including 1,500 special forces. Up until now, Seoul has only provided humanitarian aid to Kyiv, though it has been reported the country has indirectly supplied artillery shells via the U.S. In June, South Korea said it would reconsider its policy of not directly supplying Ukraine with weapons after Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un signed a security agreement in Pyongyang.	https://kyivindependent.com/rutte-south-korean-president-north-korea/	2024-10-21T05:40:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179187617.jpg
Russian attack against Zaporizhzhia kills 2, injures 15	A Russian strike against the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia on the morning of Oct. 21 killed two people and injured 15, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. At least three of the injured are in serious condition. Some 30 buildings were damaged after Russia struck the residential area of the city early on Oct. 21. The full consequences of the attack are being determined. Fedorov did not say what weaponry Russia used in the attack but reported ballistic missile warnings several times during the day. Zaporizhzhia, the regional center of the partially occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast, is a common target of Russian attacks. Some 710,000 residents lived in the city before the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-against-zaporizhzhia-kills-2-injures-15/	2024-10-21T05:29:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Zaporizhzhia-Oct-21.jpg
US announces $400 million defense aid package for Ukraine	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. The U.S. has allocated a new military assistance package for Ukraine worth $400 million, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced during his to Kyiv on Oct. 21, Ukrinform reported. The exact content of the latest aid package is not immediately clear, but Austin said it would include ammunition, military equipment, and weapons. The Pentagon chief arrived in Kyiv in a surprise visit to discuss further support for Ukraine as the uncertain U.S. presidential election looms. There are fears that if Republican nominee and ex-President Donald Trump beats his Democratic challenger, Vice President Kamala Harris, he might withdraw or scale down U.S. support for Ukraine and force the country toward painful concessions. Washington has allocated some $175 billion in assistance to Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, including roughly $70 billion worth of arms and military equipment. Despite the U.S. support, Russian forces keep grinding on in the country&apos;s east while Ukraine braces for fresh strikes against the energy grid with the coming winter.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-400-million-package/	2024-10-21T05:11:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2157421608.jpg
Ex-military logistics chief named new head of Ukroboronprom state defense company	Oleh Huliak, who has been acting CEO of the state-owned enterprise Ukrainian Defense Industry (Ukroboronprom), was officially appointed to the job on Oct. 21, the company announced. Huliak replaced Herman Smetanin, who was appointed the strategic industries minister as part of the biggest wartime government reshuffle in September, replacing Alexander Kamyshin. Smetanin had been in charge of Ukroporonprom since June 2023 after his predecessor, Yurii Husiev, was reportedly dismissed for the company&#x2019;s poor performance under his watch. Ukrainska Pravda reported last June that the main problem for Ukroboronprom under Husiev&#x2019;s leadership was the poor progress in a missile program. The Supervisory Board of Ukraine&apos;s state-owned defense production conglomerate selected Huliak among 20 candidates for the position. Representatives of the U.S., U.K., and German embassies were involved in the interviews with the shortlisted nominees. Smetanin outlined Huliak&apos;s main tasks, such as increasing production volumes, building an effective anti-corruption infrastructure, and completing the reform of Ukraine&apos;s defense sector. &quot;Oleh Huliak is well aware of the immediate needs of the army, he is an experienced leader,&quot; Smetanin added. Before his appointment to Ukroboronprom, Huliak served as the commander of the Logistics Forces of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces since 2021. He started his military career in the 1990s and later held top positions, serving as commander of several Ukrainian brigades. A decorated major general, Huliak headed the Odesa Military Academy from 2012 to 2021. Ukroboronprom is a leading strategic manufacturer of weapons and military hardware in Ukraine. The association includes enterprises that develop, manufacture, sell, repair, and modernize weapons, military equipment, and ammunition. Since the all-out war started, the company has relocated much of its production abroad and reduced its activities across Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/oleh-huliak-named-new-head-of-ukroboronprom/	2024-10-21T05:02:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-21-134439.png
Ukraine destroys Russian Buk air defense system, military says	Ukrainian forces destroyed a Russian Buk-M3 air defense system overnight on Oct. 21, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. The operation was reportedly carried out by Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces together with other military units. The Buk-M3 is the latest version of the Soviet-era Buk systems family. It is a medium-range system that can intercept aerial targets, including tactical ballistic missiles, at a range of up to 65 kilometers (40 miles). The Russian anti-aircraft system was located around 60 kilometers from the front line, the General Staff said. The cost of such equipment is estimated at $40-50 million. The statement did not specify the exact location of the targeted system. Ukrainian forces have destroyed 979 Russian anti-aircraft systems throughout the full-scale war, the General Staff said in its regular morning report on Oct. 21.	https://kyivindependent.com/buk-destroyed/	2024-10-21T03:57:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Buk-M3.jpg
Ukraine's 46th brigade releases video of repelled Russian attack near Kurakhove	Ukraine&apos;s 46th Airmobile Brigade said on Oct. 20 that it had repelled a Russian attack in the Kurakhove sector in Donetsk Oblast, releasing footage of the engagement. Russia is carrying out intense attacks in multiple sections of the eastern front, with attempts to break through Ukraine&apos;s defenses in Donetsk Oblast toward the towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. Ukrainian troops fended off 59 attacks in the Kurakhove sector over the past day alone, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said in its latest update on Oct. 21. Russian forces tried to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense lines and capture the village of Maksymilianivka to create conditions for further advance toward Kurakhove, the 46th brigade said. 0:00/1&#xD7;The footage shared on Oct. 20, 2024, showing Ukrainian forces repelling a Russian attack in the Kurakhove sector. (The 46th Airmobile Brigade/Facebook)The unsuccessful attack reportedly involved seven tanks and 11 infantry fighting vehicles, with Ukrainian forces destroying seven pieces of Russian equipment. &quot;Two more damaged tanks managed to roll back,&quot; the brigade said. The fate of the 28 fleeing Russian soldiers is unknown, the unit added. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. Earlier in the day, Ukraine&apos;s National Guard said that Russian forces are attempting to storm the Selydove sector in Donetsk Oblast, using large numbers of infantry. The town of Selydove is located some 25 kilometers (15 miles) from Kurakhove.	https://kyivindependent.com/46th-brigade-kurakhove/	2024-10-21T03:41:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-21-130947.png
Kremlin calls North Korean troops reports 'contradictory' but stops short of denial	The Kremlin spokesperson on Oct. 21 &#xA0;called the recent reports about the dispatch of North Korean troops to aid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine &quot;contradictory&quot; but did not confirm nor deny the claims. Kyiv and Seoul accused Pyongyang of preparing to send more than 10,000 military personnel to assist Russia, adding that some troops had already arrived in Russia and Russian-occupied Ukraine. &quot;We see a lot of contradictory information,&quot; spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Russian media, the state-controlled news agency Interfax reported. &quot;The South Koreans say one thing, and then the Pentagon says that they have no confirmation, so there is a lot of contradictory information. So that&apos;s probably how it should be approached.&quot; The U.S. is yet to confirm the presence of the North Korean troops in Russia or Ukraine, though a senior U.S. lawmaker said such a step would mean crossing a &quot;red line&quot; and necessitate immediate action. &quot;(North Korea) is our close neighbor and partner, and we are developing relations in many spheres, which is our sovereign right,&quot; Peskov said, claiming that this cooperation is &quot;not directed against third countries.&quot; The spokesperson said questions regarding the conduct of the war should be directed toward the Defense Ministry. The recent comments signify a shift in rhetoric from earlier this month when Peskov outright dismissed the reports as &quot;fake news.&quot; The reported transfer of North Korean military personnel comes as the most significant step by Pyongyang in support of Moscow&apos;s war in Ukraine. North Korea has previously provided Russia with extensive arms packages, including artillery shells and ballistic missiles.	https://kyivindependent.com/peskov-north-korea/	2024-10-21T03:34:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245735181.jpeg

Russia attacking toward town near Pokrovsk, National Guard says	Russian forces are attempting to storm the Selydove sector in Donetsk Oblast, using large numbers of infantry, Ukraine&apos;s National Guard said on Oct. 21. Selydove, with a pre-war population of nearly 21,000 people, is located 18 kilometers south (11 miles) of Pokrovsk, which has been a focal point of Russia&apos;s offensive in recent months in the Donetsk sector of the front line. According to the National Guard, Russian troops periodically conduct mechanized assaults near Selydove, involving from three to five armored vehicles. Ukrainian troops repelled 17 Russian assault attempts in the Pokrovsk sector over the past day, the statement read. The estimated advance of Russian forces near the town of Selydove in Donetsk Oblast as of Oct. 20, 2024, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)The news came amid claims spread by Russian propaganda that Ukrainian and Russian troops are fighting street-to-street battles on the outskirts of Selydove. When asked by the Kyiv Independent about the situation in the area, the Ukrainian military refused to comment. Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in defending the front line, particularly in Donetsk Oblast, where Russia has consistently concentrated its offensive potential. Following Ukraine&apos;s withdrawal from Vuhledar in early October, Russian forces have been focusing their efforts against the Donetsk Oblast towns of Pokrovsk, Toretsk, and Kurakhove, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are slowly losing ground under Russian pressure.	https://kyivindependent.com/national-guard-selydove/	2024-10-21T02:34:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2169569068.jpg
Seoul summons Russian envoy over North Korean troops' deployment	South Korea on Oct. 21 summoned the Russian ambassador in Seoul, Georgy Zinoviev, to protest the dispatch of North Korean troops to assist Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine, the Yonhap news agency reported. Seoul and Kyiv accused North Korea of preparing to transfer between 10,000 and 12,000 military personnel to Russia in a sign of deepening military cooperation between the two countries. Some North Korean troops had reportedly already arrived in Russia and Russian-occupied Ukraine to share experiences with their Russian counterparts. South Korea&apos;s First Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Hong-kyun summoned Zinoviev to call for the &quot;immediate withdrawal of North Korean troops and (to) stop relevant cooperation&quot; with North Korea, Yonhap wrote, citing the South Korean Foreign Ministry. The South Korean diplomat &quot;condemned in the strongest terms the illegal military cooperation, including... (North Korea&apos;s) troop deployment, and sternly warned that South Korea will respond with every possible means, with the international community, to any acts that threaten the core interests of South Korea.&quot; South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it believes North Korea will deploy four brigades totaling 12,000 soldiers to the war in Ukraine, including 1,500 special forces. It would mark the first time North Korean forces had been deployed to a foreign war. It remains unclear what steps Seoul is planning to take. Yonhap reported in June that South Korea is mulling openly providing arms supplies to Ukraine in response to deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. The Kremlin has previously denied the reports of North Korean troop dispatch as fake news. The U.S. is yet to confirm the presence of the North Korean troops in Russia or Ukraine, though a senior U.S. lawmaker said such a step would mean crossing a &quot;red line&quot; and urged immediate action.	https://kyivindependent.com/seoul-summons-russian-envoy-over-north-korean-troops-deployment/	2024-10-21T02:14:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-672536428.jpg
UN's nuclear agency funded Russian research in occupied Crimea, RFE/RL reports	The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has financed Russian state scientific research in occupied Crimea since the peninsula was illegally captured in 2014, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported on Oct. 21, citing obtained documents. According to the agency&apos;s internal documents, the IAEA signed at least two agreements with Russian research institutes to conduct research that included fieldwork in Crimea. The deals were signed between 2016 and 2019, and the first was reportedly extended in the summer of 2019. The outlet described the projects as limited in size and scope. The IAEA has repeatedly publicly declared its commitment to Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity, urging Russia to withdraw from Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest nuclear power station in Europe, which has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. In a statement to RFE/RL, the IAEA said that the agency continues to recognize Crimea as part of Ukraine. It described its studies on the occupied territory as being of a &quot;purely technical nature&quot; and said they &quot;do not constitute any change in the agency&apos;s position on the status of Crimea.&quot; The IAEA representative also called the counterpart of one of the projects, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), an international research center based in Moscow Oblast, &quot;not a Russian organization but an International Intergovernmental Scientific Research Organization located in Russia.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s permanent diplomatic mission in Vienna, where the IAEA is headquartered, told RFE/RL that none of the IAEA&apos;s research projects in Crimea have been approved by the Ukrainian government. Previously, Ukrainian authorities criticized the agency for &quot;the ambivalent position&quot; and &quot;the retransmission of Russian propaganda.&quot; Rafael Grossi, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), visited both Kyiv and Moscow since the start of the all-out war as well as the Russian-occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Monitoring teams from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have been based at the facility on rotation since September 2022, but Russian authorities still deny IAEA inspectors full access to the plant.	https://kyivindependent.com/iaea-crimea/	2024-10-21T01:53:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2056052044.jpg
The Counteroffensive: An inside look at the virtual reality therapy reshaping veterans' rehabilitation	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article was published by the twice-weekly newsletter &#x201C;The Counteroffensive with Tim Mak&#x201D; on Oct. 17, 2024, and has been re-published by the Kyiv Independent with permission. To subscribe to The Counteroffensive, click here. Last year, Mykola Horishnyi was declared clinically dead &#x2013; twice. The Ukrainian soldier suffered severe blood loss from an explosion, likely a Russian mine. &#x201C;Tomorrow will mark exactly one year since I was wounded &#x2013; at 4:45 p.m. I still can&apos;t fully grasp that this all happened to me and that I am no longer in the trenches,&#x201D; Mykola told The Counteroffensive. Mykola suffers from PTSD, making it difficult for him to discuss the traumatic events he endured. He recently began psychotherapy at a rehabilitation center in the Kyiv suburb of Borodianka, which is pioneering unique virtual reality therapy. Ukraine&apos;s Health Ministry reported in August that the number of people struggling with mental health issues has doubled since 2023. Market research data shows that sales of antidepressants have grown by more than 50% compared to the pre-war year of 2021, according to the BBC. Typically, around 15% of people develop PTSD after experiencing traumatic events of violent conflict or war. Most can overcome its effects with the right professional help, though traditional therapy doesn&apos;t always succeed. The increase in mental health problems suggests a major social crisis after the war, as hundreds of thousands of soldiers try to reintegrate into peacetime civilian life. To address these challenges, technological innovators are experimenting with new forms of virtual reality (VR) therapy. &#x201C;If it wasn&apos;t for our doctors, we wouldn&apos;t be talking now,&#x201D; Mykola said. For Mykola, it all began when he volunteered to join the army in February 2023. &#x201C;I wanted to be deployed to the front lines in the east, to get to Crimea, take our Crimea back, and that&#x2019;s it. But of course, it didn&apos;t work out as expected,&quot; he said. A year has passed since Mykola was injured, but he is still haunted by the memories. &#x201C;I still can&#x2019;t fully comprehend that this is my reality now, that I&#x2019;m no longer in the trenches, running around, storming positions. When I close my eyes or sit alone, I feel like I&#x2019;m still there. I see the trenches in my sleep &#x2013; these nightmares never leave me,&#x201D; Mykola said. Currently, Mykola is receiving therapy and retreat services at the Borodianka Center for Social and Psychological Rehabilitation. The center is one of the few places in Ukraine actively developing VR therapy. Exposure therapy using VR has shown promising therapeutic qualities. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s hard to think of many mental health conditions that it couldn&#x2019;t benefit. We are working on treatments for a large number of conditions,&#x201D; Daniel Freeman, a professor at the University of Oxford, told the BBC. A Ukrainian soldier undergoes a speleotherapy session at a rehabilitation center in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Oct. 4, 2023. (Chris McGrath/Getty Images)A specialist is always present to provide support, but the main goal is to recreate traumatic memories to help the patient overcome stress and fear. &#x201C;Our brains are built in a way that they don&#x2019;t really tell the difference between virtual and physical reality. Virtual reality helps bring a person back to normal memories and feelings by immersing them in a virtual environment,&#x201D; said Yevhen Kotukh, a Ukrainian VR specialist who is actively developing this technology. Yevhen and his team are working on creating a new technology for the rapid diagnosis of PTSD. They plan to use virtual reality to evoke emotional responses in veterans by showing a two-minute simulation of combat operations. Signals from the brain can then help determine whether the person has PTSD. Currently, the VR technology at the center is in the early stages of development, but the team is actively collaborating with donors and partners to improve it. It is expected that standard treatment will require up to ten sessions of 50 minutes each, taking place weekly. When the course is finished, a person&apos;s sensitivity to stress should decrease to a manageable level. Ultimately, VR therapy can help more than two-thirds of people with PTSD when used alongside a psychologist. Traditional exposure therapy &#x2013;where the therapist creates a safe environment and exposes the patient to their fears &#x2013; may not be suitable for everyone and has its limitations. First, it takes time to engage the soldier and begin addressing traumatic events. Second, the veteran&#x2019;s memory and imagination might not be sufficient to process the trauma. Additionally, it can be hard for individuals to open up and speak freely about painful memories. Currently, active cooperation with foreign partners is underway to create a specialized room with sensors that allow for free movement, enhancing the realism of the VR experience. In addition to psychological assistance, VR helps with phantom pain for those who have lost limbs but can still feel pain in the amputated areas. Mykyta Makazan, a veteran who had his leg amputated, faced this problem. He shared that sometimes the pain was so intense it made it difficult to get out of bed. With sensors attached to the muscles of his lost limb and virtual reality games designed to develop motor skills, he can rewire his brain to believe that the limb he moves in the game is his own. This approach helps him move the muscles and stretch them, alleviating the phantom pain. The goal of virtual reality therapy is to relieve the pain experienced in reality. As Mykola discussed the nightmares that still haunt him, his smile faded. To shift the conversation, I asked about things that distract him, and he smiled. &#x201C;Family. Home, routine, communication &#x2013; when my wife comes home from work and we talk, when we go for a walk, this center in Borodianka,&#x201D; Mykola said. All veterans should experience such support and assistance on their difficult paths toward physical and psychological rehabilitation.

Russia detains 18 North Korean soldiers who left positions in Kursk Oblast, source says	Russian authorities detained 18 North Korean soldiers who abandoned their positions in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, a military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 21. Moscow&apos;s ally Pyongyang is preparing to deploy around 11,000 soldiers to help Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine early next month, Kyiv said, adding that some had already arrived. Eighteen of them had deserted their positions in Russian regions near the Ukrainian border, Suspilne reported on Oct. 15, citing unnamed intelligence officials. Hromadske reported, citing a military intelligence source, that around 40 North Korean soldiers had arrived in Russia to exchange skills with their Russian counterparts. After the training, the 18 North Koreans were left in a forest in Kursk Oblast without food and instructions for several days, leading to them abandoning their post to find the Russian command on Oct. 14. Two days later, the missing soldiers were found and detained by Russian authorities roughly 60 kilometers (almost 40 miles) from their original position, Hromadske wrote. South Korea confirmed the transfer of North Korean military personnel to Russia, calling it a &quot;grave security threat.&quot; U.S. Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Michael R. Turner said that such a step must constitute a &quot;red line for the United States and NATO.&quot; A video that emerged online on Oct. 18 purportedly showed North Korean soldiers in a Russian military camp receiving equipment and preparing for deployment against Ukraine. Russia and North Korea have deepened their cooperation throughout the full-scale war, with Moscow receiving extensive packages of artillery shells and ballistic missiles.	https://kyivindependent.com/18-north-korean-soldier-detained/	2024-10-21T01:17:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1154567149.jpg

Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least three people and injured at least 28 over the past day, including a child, regional authorities reported early on Oct. 21. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 59 of the 116 Shahed-type attack drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force said. Forty-five drones were reportedly &quot;lost&quot; on Ukrainian territory, and 10 more were still present in the Ukrainian airspace at the time of the publication. Russia also attacked Ukraine with an Iskander-M or North Korean KN-23 ballistic missile, one Kh-35 guided aerial missile, and one Kh-31P guided aerial missile. Russia launched attack drones against Kyiv overnight, all of which were reportedly destroyed. One man was injured, suffering burns to his face, the city authorities said. A Russian missile attack against the city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast late on Oct. 20 injured four people, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. The victims included a 12-year-old girl, a 22-year-old man, and two women aged 63 and 36. A hotel, five multi-story buildings, a cultural facility, a bank, two shops, and 14 cars were damaged. Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast injured three residents in Novoselydivka, Kurakhove, and Illinka, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. A Russian airstrike against the city of Kharkiv on the evening of Oct. 20 injured at least 13 people, the State Emergency Service said. Earlier the same day, a 71-year-old man and a 72-year-old woman were found dead under the rubble following a Russian attack against the village of Novoplatonivka, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast injured two people, according to the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. Two high-rise buildings, 23 houses, a farm building, and cars were damaged. Russia launched drone strikes against the Shalyhyne community in Sumy Oblast on Oct. 20, killing a resident, regional authorities reported. Overnight attacks against the region hit a critical infrastructure facility, leading to blackouts in several settlements. Six people were injured and several houses damaged in a Russian attack against Zaporizhzhia on the morning of Oct. 21, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. Cherkasy, Khmelnytskyi, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Vinnytsia, Chernihiv, Poltava, and Kirovohrad oblasts were also attacked, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-100/	2024-10-21T00:35:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Kharkiv-Oct-21.jpg
Russia's Black Sea Fleet forced to redeploy over Ukrainian drone attacks, Russian proxy admits	Russia has redeployed vessels of its Black Sea Fleet due to attacks by Ukrainian naval drones, Dmitry Rogozin, a Russian proxy head of occupation authorities in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, said in an interview with Kremlin-controlled Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper published on Oct. 21. Rogozin&apos;s surprise admission is in line with previous statements made by Ukrainian officials. Successful Ukrainian strikes on occupied Crimea forced Moscow to pull out much of its naval forces from the peninsula to the Russian city of Novorossiysk in Krasnodar Krai, which became a key port for the Russian Black Sea Fleet. According to Rogozin, a &quot;military-technical revolution&quot; took place during Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, impacting the usefulness of traditional weapons systems. He referred to the Russian Black Sea Fleet as a weapon system that had undergone changes during the war. &quot;It (Black Sea Fleet) was forced... to change its residence because our large ships became targets for the enemy&apos;s unmanned boats,&quot; Rogozin said. Ukraine has repeatedly struck Russia&apos;s vessels since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Around 30% of Russia&#x2019;s Black Sea Fleet is lost or disabled, according to the Ukrainian military.	https://kyivindependent.com/black-sea-fleet-changes-its-residence-due-to-ukrainian-drone-attacks-russian-official-says/	2024-10-21T00:22:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1240487588.jpg
Russian high-ranking pilot found dead in Bryansk Oblast, military intelligence says	Russian pilot Dmitry Golenkov, who participated in Moscow&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, was found dead in the town of Suponevo in Bryansk Oblast on Oct. 20, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported. According to the agency, Golenkov suffered multiple head injuries, probably caused by a hammer. HUR published photos purporting to show Golenkov&apos;s body in an apple orchard, without claiming responsibility for the incident. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Golenkov served as chief of staff of a Russian aviation squadron. He was a pilot of the 52nd Heavy Bomber Regiment of the Russian Air Force, which is based at the Shaykovka airfield and hosts Tu-22M3 bombers. Russia uses these aircraft to carry out missile attacks against Ukraine. Golenkov was involved in missile strikes on Ukrainian civilian targets, HUR said, including the Amstor shopping mall in the city of Kremenchuk in Poltava Oblast in June 2022. According to authorities, more than 1,000 people were inside the building at the moment of the attack. Twenty-two people were killed, and dozens were injured. Golenkov was also reportedly responsible for an attack on an apartment building in the city of Dnipro in January 2023. It was one of the deadliest single Russian attacks on Ukraine, killing 46 people, including six children.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-pilot-found-dead/	2024-10-20T23:17:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-664707660.jpg
US Defense Secretary Austin arrives in Kyiv	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in Kyiv on Oct. 21 as Ukraine hopes to secure further support ahead of the uncertain U.S. election, CNN reported. Austin&apos;s visit comes only a few days after U.S. President Joe Biden arrived in Berlin to meet the leaders of the U.K., Germany, and France to discuss continued support for Ukraine and Kyiv&apos;s five-step victory plan. The U.S. defense chief is expected to meet his Ukrainian counterpart, Rustem Umerov, to discuss Ukraine&apos;s battlefield needs. The visit will also serve as a chance to &quot;step back&quot; and assess the U.S.-Ukrainian relationship over the course of the full-scale war, CNN reported. Ukraine is finding itself in an increasingly difficult position. Despite Washington&apos;s support, Russian forces keep grinding on in the country&apos;s east while Ukraine braces for fresh strikes against the energy grid with the coming winter.	https://kyivindependent.com/austin-arrives-in-kyiv/	2024-10-20T22:54:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/photo_2023-04-12-23.21.02.jpeg

Navalny's prison diaries to be published posthumously this week	Alexei Navalny&apos;s memoir &quot;Patriot&quot; will be published posthumously on Oct. 22. The memoir is compiled from the Russian opposition leader&apos;s prison diaries and was edited in part by his widow, Yulia Navalnaya. The book will be released in 22 languages, including Russian. Navalny died on Feb. 16 in a penal colony in northern Russia, after being convicted in several fabricated criminal cases as part of the Kremlin&apos;s crackdown on dissent. Leaders around the world have blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for his death. In &quot;Patriot,&quot; Navalny wrote that he expected to die in prison. &quot;I knew from the outset that I would be imprisoned for life &#x2014; either the rest of my life or until the end of the life of this regime,&quot; he wrote in a March 2022 diary entry. &quot;I will spend the rest of my life in prison and die here.&quot; Navalnaya has said she hopes the memoir ensures that her husband won&apos;t be forgotten and that his political activism continues to inspire the Russian opposition movement. &quot;I want his voice to be heard loudly even after his death,&quot; she told the BBC&apos;s Russia service in an interview ahead of the book&apos;s release. Navalnaya has accused Putin of murdering her husband and vowed to continue Navalny&apos;s political work. A Moscow court ordered her arrest in absentia in July, charging her with &quot;participating in an extremist organization&quot; due to her involvement with the Anti-Corruption Foundation, an organization founded by her late husband. Navalnaya would &quot;go to the elections as a presidential candidate&quot; if she ever returned to Russia, she told the BBC. The Kremlin has denied any role in Navalny&apos;s death.	https://kyivindependent.com/navalnys-prison-diaries-to-be-published-posthumously-this-week/	2024-10-20T19:22:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2008366667.jpg
Ukraine's new 'Sting' drone designed to hunt Shaheds, Telegraph reports	Ukraine is developing a new drone that can track and intercept Shahed-type attack drones, the Telegraph reported on Oct. 20. Russia has launched thousands of Iranian-designed Shahed drones against Ukraine since the fall of 2022. Kyiv&apos;s new weapon, named &quot;Sting,&quot; is a first-person-view (FPV) drone that can chase and neutralize Shahed drones in lieu of conventional air defense systems, the Telegraph reported. According to the drone&apos;s developers, the Wild Hornets group, &quot;Sting&quot; will be able to fly at altitudes approaching 10,000 feet, with a speed of over 100 miles per hour. The weapon will be operated from the ground using VR goggles. It is the first drone specifically developed to target Russia&apos;s arsenal of Shaheds. &quot;Its average cost is dozens of times lower than that of the Shahed drone,&quot; a Wild Hornet source told the Telegraph regarding the Sting drone. The lower production costs may allow Ukraine to conserve its air defense munitions over the coming months, as Russia intensifies aerial attacks targeting Ukrainian cities and the nation&apos;s energy grid. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 20 that Russia has launched a total of 6,230 Shahed-type drones at Ukraine since the beginning of the year. Throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing modern warfare. Multiple videos have shown how Ukrainian FPV drones hit Russian reconnaissance drones and other costly equipment on the battlefield. Ukraine in September established the Unmanned Systems Forces, a separate branch of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces dedicated to drone warfare. Kyiv said it aims to produce 1 million drones this year, in addition to the thousands pledged by foreign partners.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-new-sting-drone-designed-to-hunt-shaheds-telegraph-reports/	2024-10-20T17:42:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/shahed.jpg
Sandu leads in 1st round of Moldovan elections, voters reject EU referendum	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Moldovan President Maia Sandu led the first round of the country&apos;s presidential election on Oct. 20 with nearly 39 percent of the vote, the Moldovan election commission announced. The preliminary results are based on over 93 percent of the tallied votes. If no candidate wins a majority, a second round of voting will take place on Nov. 3. Sandu will likely face off against her main competitor, Alexandr Stoianoglo, who captured approximately 28 percent of the vote in the first round. Moldovan voters also rejected enshrining the country&apos;s path to European Union accession, with over 52 percent voting against the amendment in a referendum held alongside the presidential election. The election results have been tainted by allegations of Russian interference, with Moldovan lawmakers claiming that Moscow spent millions of dollars in a campaign to unseat Sandu and vote down the EU referendum. Tensions between Moscow and Chisinau have been mounting since February 2022 amid fears that Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine may spill into Moldova via Transnistria, an unrecognized breakaway territory occupied by Russian troops since 1991. The pro-Western incumbent, Maia Sandu, has previously accused Moscow of plotting to overthrow her government in an attempted coup. &#xA0; Throughout the current election, allegations of Russian meddling continuously surfaced, with pro-Russian oligarch Ilan Shor accused of trying to influence voters to oppose Sandu. The Kremlin&apos;s efforts are part of a broader attempt to undermine Moldova&apos;s pro-Western leadership in the country. Moldovan authorities have said that over $15 million in Russian funds have reportedly been funneled to over 130,000 Moldovans, with voters instructed on how to vote in the upcoming election. Shor, a Moldovan-Israeli tycoon, was accused of laundering the money and orchestrating the network, despite his political party being banned. Moldova&apos;s state-owned broadcaster reported on Sept. 28 that vandals had splashed paint across the entrance of its building in the capital city of Chisinau. This incident occurred a day after police attributed similar acts to a group trained in Moscow with the aim of destabilizing the elections. The U.S., U.K., and Canada warned of potential Russian interference in Moldova&apos;s elections in a joint statement issued on June 13. &#xA0; &quot;If Russia&apos;s election meddling proves unsuccessful in Moldova, there is reason to believe Moscow will work to incite protests,&quot; the statement said. Shortly after the warning, Sanda approved changes to the country&apos;s treason laws, allowing some wartime treason laws to apply to peacetime, as well as extending punishments and creating a new category of laws for assisting a foreign state. Moldova launched EU accession talks in Luxembourg on June 25, the same day that Ukraine began its long-awaited membership negotiations. The Oct. 20 referendum, if passed, would have amended Moldova&apos;s constitution to formally include the country&apos;s accession to the EU.	https://kyivindependent.com/sandu-leads-first-round-moldova-elections/	2024-10-20T16:18:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178740400.jpg
Russian missile attack in Kharkiv injures 9	A Russian missile attack targeting Kharkiv the evening of Oct. 20 injured nine civilians, the Kharkiv Oblast police reported. The wounded include four women aged 22 to 53 and five men aged 21 to 37, according to regional authorities. Russian missiles targeted three districts in the city of Kharkiv at around 10 p.m. local time, police reported. Some areas of the city lost electricity due to the attack. The strike also damaged apartment buildings, houses, garages, gas stations, and cars. Emergency workers have been dispatched to all attack sites and the full consequences of the missile strike are currently under investigation. Kharkiv has endured constant Russian attacks for over two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The last few months have seen intensifying strikes against densely-populated areas of the city. Ukrainian officials have also warned that Moscow is once again preparing to carry out strikes against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure ahead of the winter months, causing blackouts and disruptions to essential services.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-in-kharkiv-injures-9/	2024-10-20T14:32:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2114357693.jpg
Russia has launched over 6,100 attack drones at Ukraine since start of 2024, Zelensky says	Russia has launched a total of 6,130 Shahed-type drones since the start of 2024, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Oct. 20. Russia has launched thousands of cheap but effective Iranian-designed Shahed-type drones against Ukraine since the fall of 2022. In recent weeks, Russia has stepped up its drone attacks &#x2014; for the first time since the full-scale invasion, they targeted cities and towns across Ukraine on a daily basis since the start of September. On Aug. 26, Russia launched its largest attack on Ukraine so far with 127 missiles and 109 drones, while Ukraine downed 102 missiles and 99 drones, according to the Air Force. Russian strikes hit several civilian, energy, and fuel facilities, including a dam in Kyiv, part of the Kyiv Hydroelectric Power Plant. Recently, Russia appears to have switched tactics to use more drones in its attacks, with the country utilizing 129 Shahed-type drones in its attack earlier this week on Oct. 18, Zelensky said. In his evening address, Zelensky criticized &quot;the free world&apos;s indecision&quot; in delaying the provision of additional defense systems. &quot;There needs to be more pressure on Russia&apos;s ability to already produce these weapons. We need the capability to destroy not only the storage bases for the &apos;Shaheds&apos; but also the entire infrastructure for their production and logistics.&quot; On Oct. 9, Ukraine&apos;s military struck a base storing 400 Iranian Shahed-type drones near the village of Oktyabrsky in Russia&apos;s Kranodar Krai. While initially sourcing Shahed-type drones from Iran, in an August 2023 report, the U.K. Defense Ministry said Russia had begun domestic production.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-has-launched-over-6-100-attack-drones-at-ukraine-since-start-of-2024-zelensky-says/	2024-10-20T13:23:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1982613220-1.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine says it struck airfield and 'largest explosives factory' in Russia	Key developments on Oct. 19-20: Ukraine said on Oct. 20 that it attacked Russia&apos;s &quot;largest explosives plant&quot; and an airfield overnight, the latest in a series of long-range drone attacks in the rear to slowly grind down the bigger foe&apos;s powerful war machine from afar. A source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent that the drones targeted the large state-owned Sverdlov Plant in the city of Dzerzhinsk in the Nizhny Novgorod region, some 900 kilometers deep into Russia. The plant has been under sanctions by the U.S. and the EU since 2023, over what the U.S. State Department says is its work &quot;acquiring goods in support of Russia&apos;s war effort.&quot; The factory produces explosives, industrial chemicals, detonators and ammunition, the U.S. said in a press release when the sanctions were announced. The source told the Kyiv Independent that the plant produces aviation and artillery shells, aviation bombs, and warheads that help Russia continue waging its war against Ukraine. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported later in the day that Ukraine had also struck the Lipetsk-2 airfield in the Lipetsk region, located over 400 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. This attack targeted ammunition depots, fuel storage facilities and aircraft on an airfield known to be home to Russian Su-34, Su-35 and MiG-31 aircraft, it added. The operations were carried out in cooperation between the SBU, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), and the Special Operations Forces, the SBU source said. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the report. Outmanned and outgunned on the battlefield Ukraine has turned to homemade drones to try to exhaust Russian combat capabilities as much as possible from afar, targeting Russian military-industrial complex facilities, airbases or oil refineries. While Ukraine regularly claims attacks deep into Russia, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of the reports and the scale of the damage inflicted. &quot;The SBU worked on strengthening the sanctions against the Sverdlov plant,&quot; the SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We added drones to the economic sanctions, which give an instant effect. Work on reducing the enemy&apos;s military capabilities will continue.&quot; Earlier in October, another Ukrainian drone strike set ablaze a Russian weapons depot storing North Korean ammunition in Bryansk Oblast, Ukraine&#x2019;s General Staff reported on Oct. 9. In September, Estonian Colonel Ants Kiviselg, head of the Estonian Defense Forces Intelligence Center, said Ukraine&apos;s drone strike on the arms depot in Russia&apos;s Tver Oblast destroyed two to three months&apos; worth of munitions. A Russian overnight missile strike on the central-eastern city of Kryvyi Rih injured 17 people, Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of the city&apos;s military administration, reported on Oct. 20. Russian troops struck the city, located in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, twice with ballistic missiles, according to Vilkul. Eight of the injured are currently in the hospital, but their conditions are &quot;moderate,&quot; he said in a post on Telegram. Vilkul said that Russia targeted &quot;peaceful civilian sites,&quot; damaging 15 buildings, three educational institutions, three administrative buildings, seven businesses, a hotel, three fire trucks, and 20 cars. Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of President Volodymyr Zelensky, has regularly faced missile attacks, as it is located not far from the front line. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow&apos;s forces have attacked military and civilian sites across the country using missiles and drones. Kryvyi Rih, with a population of around 660,000, is the second-largest city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. The city is about 70 kilometers northwest of its nearest front-line zone. A large rally in support of Georgia&apos;s accession to the European Union was held in Tbilisi&apos;s Freedom Square on Oct. 20, ahead of the upcoming parliamentary election scheduled for Oct. 26. The &quot;Georgia Chooses the European Union&quot; march brought what appeared to be several tens of thousand of protesters to the streets of the Tbilisi, social media videos show. Protesters waved EU and Georgian flag while singing the country&apos;s national anthem. President Salome Zourabichvili, a vocal opponent of the ruling Georgian Dream party, participated in the rally, urging protesters to vote for pro-European parties during the election. Zourabichvili said the protest &quot;shows that Georgia has already won and will reintegrate with Europe.&quot; Zourabichvili also addressed President Volodymyr Zelensky in her speech, stating that Ukraine is &#xA0;&quot;fighting for Georgia as well. You will be victorious and we will enter the European Union together.&quot; Ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in Georgia, massive pro- EU march is underway in #Tbilisi. #GeVote2024 pic.twitter.com/VyLPUnX2vy Georgia&apos;s received EU candidate status alongside Ukraine in December 2023. Although questions surrounding Georgia&apos;s candidacy continue to swirl as the ruling Georgian Dream party continues to rekindle relations with Russia. Concerns about Georgia&apos;s democracy have reached a fever pitch after the ruling Georgian Dream party passed the foreign agents law, which requires organizations that receive foreign funding to be labeled as &quot;foreign agents&quot; and mirrors repressive Russian legislation used to crack down on Kremlin regime critics. On Sept. 14, the de facto leader of the ruling Georgian Dream party, oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, as part of his party&apos;s larger trend of rapprochement with Russia declared that Georgia should &quot;apologize&quot; for Russia&apos;s 2008 war against the country. Western officials have sanctioned in recent months Georgian officials who they deem as having a role in committing human rights abuses. Moscow formally initiated processes cozying relations with Tbilisi on Oct. 10 as Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a presidential decree expanding visa-free entry for Georgian citizens who are working or studying in Russia. Defense ministers of the G7 countries reaffirmed their commitment to supporting Ukraine&apos;s integration into NATO, according to the joint statement following their meeting in Naples on Oct. 19. &quot;We support Ukraine on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership,&#x201D; the statement said. The ministers also pledged continued military assistance to Ukraine, both in the short and long term, and emphasized the importance of training and educational support for the Ukrainian Defense Forces. &quot;We welcome the respective efforts of NATO and the EU under the NATO Security Assistance and Training Program for Ukraine and the EU Military Assistance Mission,&quot; the document states The ministers also confirmed their goal of achieving a &quot;comprehensive, just, and lasting peace&quot; that respects Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as set out by international law. However, the White House&#x2019;s position regarding Ukraine&#x2019;s accession has been that the invitation to NATO will likely not come in the short term, citing the need for reforms and fulfillment of security conditions. We are not at the stage where the Alliance is discussing issuing an invitation in the short term,&quot; U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said on Oct. 16 ahead of a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels, Voice of America reported. &quot;But, as always, we will continue talks with our friends in Ukraine about how they can move toward the Alliance,&quot; Smith added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-38/	2024-10-20T11:51:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245598723.jpg

Belarus downs Russian drone over its airspace, monitoring group says	The Belarusian Air Force downed a Russian Shahed-type drone over the country&apos;s Homel Oblast overnight on Oct. 20, the monitoring group Belarusian Hajun reported. The incident marks just the third time a Belarusian aircraft has downed a drone that entered its airspace. According to the monitoring group, three Russian attack drones entered Belarus&apos; southern territory beginning around 12:30 a.m. local time. Aircraft were scrambled to intercept the drone around 1 a.m. near the town of Yelsk in Homel Oblast, where residents reported hearing sounds of explosions. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported downing 31 of the 51 attack drones that Russia launched overnight. The Air Force added that 13 drones were lost from Ukraine&apos;s radar overnight. In early September, Belarus&apos; military confirmed the downing of a drone over its territory on for the first time since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Minsk has never publicly raised objections to Moscow &#x2013; its key ally &#x2013; over the reported drone incidents. According to Belarusian Hajun, there have been multiple cases of Russian Shahed-type drones flying off course to Belarus over the past few months as drone attacks intensify.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-downs-russian-drone-over-its-airspace-monitoring-group-says/	2024-10-20T08:47:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1704959103.jpg
Ukrainian drones struck 'largest explosives factory' in Russia, source says	Ukrainian drones struck Russia&apos;s &quot;largest explosives plant&quot; overnight, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 20. The source said the drones targeted the large state-owned Sverdlov Plant in the city of Dzerzhinsk in the Nizhny Novgorod region, some 900 kilometers deep into Russia. The plant has been under sanctions by the U.S. and the EU since 2023, over what the U.S. State Department says is its work &quot;acquiring goods in support of Russia&apos;s war effort.&quot; The factory produces explosives, industrial chemicals, detonators and ammunition, the U.S. said in a press release when the sanctions were announced. The source told the Kyiv Independent that the plant produces aviation and artillery shells, aviation bombs, and warheads that help Russia continue waging its war against Ukraine. The operation was carried out in cooperation between the SBU, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), and the Special Operations Forces, the source said. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the report. Outmanned and outgunned on the battlefield Ukraine has turned to homemade drones to try to exhaust Russian combat capabilities as much as possible from afar, targeting Russian military-industrial complex facilities, airbases or oil refineries. While Ukraine regularly claims attacks deep into Russia, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of the reports and the scale of the damage inflicted. &quot;The SBU worked on strengthening the sanctions against the Sverdlov plant,&quot; the SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We added drones to the economic sanctions, which give an instant effect. Work on reducing the enemy&apos;s military capabilities will continue.&quot; Earlier in October, another Ukrainian drone strike set ablaze a Russian weapons depot storing North Korean ammunition in Bryansk Oblast, Ukraine&#x2019;s General Staff reported on Oct. 9. In September, Estonian Colonel Ants Kiviselg, head of the Estonian Defense Forces Intelligence Center, said Ukraine&apos;s drone strike on the arms depot in Russia&apos;s Tver Oblast destroyed two to three months&apos; worth of munitions.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-struck-largest-factory-for-explosives-in-russia-source-says/	2024-10-20T03:04:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245598723.jpg
Russian overnight missile strike on Kryvyi Rih injures 17	A Russian overnight missile strike on the central-eastern city of Kryvyi Rih injured 17 people, Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of the city&apos;s military administration, reported on Oct. 20. Russian troops struck the city, located in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, twice with ballistic missiles, according to Vilkul. Eight of the injured are currently in the hospital, but their conditions are &quot;moderate,&quot; he said in a post on Telegram. &#xA0; Vilkul said that Russia targeted &quot;peaceful civilian sites,&quot; damaging 15 buildings, three educational institutions, three administrative buildings, seven businesses, a hotel, three fire trucks, and 20 cars. Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of President Volodymyr Zelensky, has regularly faced missile attacks, as it is located not far from the front line. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow&apos;s forces have attacked military and civilian sites across the country using missiles and drones. Kryvyi Rih, with a population of around 660,000, is the second-largest city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. The city is about 70 kilometers northwest of its nearest front-line zone.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-overnight-missile-strike-on-kryvyi-rih-wounds-17/	2024-10-20T01:41:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1665966342.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 677,180 troops since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 678,520 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 20. This number includes 1,340 casualties Russian forces suffered over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,035 tanks, 18,072 armored fighting vehicles, 26,987 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,565 artillery systems, 1,232 multiple launch rocket systems, 978 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 17,287 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-677-180-troops-since-feb-24-2022-2/	2024-10-19T23:33:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2150597901.jpg
Moldova votes in election, EU referendum amid alleged Russian interference	Moldova&apos;s upcoming presidential election and EU referendum on Oct. 20 are seen as critical in determining its future direction toward European Union integration. Pro-Western incumbent Maia Sandu is leading in the polls, but if she doesn&apos;t reach the 50% threshold, a runoff will take place on Nov. 3. Sandu also hopes for a strong &quot;yes&quot; vote in the referendum to solidify EU accession as a constitutional goal. Allegations of Russian meddling have recently surfaced, with pro-Russian oligarch Ilan Shor accused of trying to influence voters to oppose Sandu. Over $15 million in Russian funds have been funneled to over 130,000 Moldovans, with voters instructed on how to vote and spread disinformation about the EU via Telegram. Shor, a Moldovan-Israeli tycoon, was accused of laundering the money and orchestrating the network, despite his political party being banned. Despite these developments, police are confident that any interference will not significantly affect the election outcome.	https://kyivindependent.com/moldova-votes-in-election-eu-referendum-amid-alleged-russian-interference/	2024-10-19T21:26:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1449645090.jpg
Russia's attack on Sumy Oblast's town kills 1, injures 11	Russian forces launched an attack on Shostka, a town in Sumy Oblast, overnight on Oct. 19 using guided bombs and drones, regional authorities reported. One civilian was killed, and 11 others were injured in the attack, according to Mykola Noha, mayor of Shostka. Sumy Oblast, located on Ukraine&apos;s northeast border with Russia, is subject to daily attacks and is situated just across from Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast - the region subject to Ukraine&apos;s ongoing incursion. The mayor reported that several critical infrastructure facilities, including two schools, a kindergarten, multiple medical institutions, and 28 apartment buildings, were damaged in Shostka. Most residents in the area were left without electricity and water. Emergency crews were dispatched to the site of the attacks and conducted repairs, and rubble clearance was almost complete as of 8 p.m. local time on Oct. 19. Shostka, with its pre-war population of approximately 72,000, is located 180 kilometers northwest of the regional capital, Sumy. In recent months, Russian troops have significantly increased the use of guided aerial bombs near the border areas of Sumy Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-attack-on-sumy-oblasts-town-kills-1-injures-11/	2024-10-19T18:57:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168180900.jpg
Russian victory would bring 'chaos,' French FM says	French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot warned during a visit to Kyiv on Oct. 19 that a Russian victory over Ukraine would bring &quot;chaos&quot; to the international system. Barrot&apos;s comments came as Russian forces continued their offensive in Ukraine&#x2019;s east, including the capture of the key town of Vuhledar in early October. Barrot&apos;s visit was intended to reaffirm France&apos;s strong support for Ukraine following President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s unveiling of his victory plan to defeat Russia. The plan includes a call for increased Western military support. &quot;A Russian victory would consecrate the law of the strongest and precipitate the international order towards chaos,&quot; Barrot said, standing alongside his counterpart Andrii Sybiha. When asked if Paris supported Zelensky&apos;s victory plan, Barrot confirmed, &quot;We support the victory plan because we have been alongside Ukraine for nearly 1,000 days.&quot; However, in the rest of his remarks, Barrot referred more generally to a &quot;peace plan&quot; as the way to end the war without specifying an official position on Zelensky&apos;s detailed proposals, Agence France-Presse reported. Like other Western allies, Paris is still reviewing the plan&apos;s specifics. After meeting with Barrot, Zelensky expressed gratitude to France, saying the support for the victory plan could &quot;bring real diplomacy and a just peace closer.&quot; He described their meeting as &quot;exactly what we needed&quot; during his evening address. The core of Zelensky&apos;s plan includes an immediate invitation for Ukraine to join NATO, a position that Barrot said Paris is &quot;open&quot; to discussing with other alliance members. The plan also rejects territorial concessions and urges allies to lift restrictions on using long-range weapons provided to Ukraine against military targets within Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-victory-would-bring-chaos-french-fm-says/	2024-10-19T16:33:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179544991.jpg
Russia strikes Zaporizhzhia, injuring 10	At least 10 people were wounded in an aerial bomb attack on central Zaporizhzhia on the evening of Oct. 19, according to regional governor Ivan Fedorov. The National Police confirmed that Russian forces carried out three airstrikes on Zaporizhzhia using high-explosive bombs. The blasts partially destroyed a residential building and caused damage to nearby shops, a car wash, a shopping center warehouse, and several vehicles. Two girls, aged nine and 13, are among the injured and are receiving urgent medical care, Fedorov added via his Telegram channel. Zaporizhzhia Oblast in southeastern Ukraine remains a frequent target of Russia&apos;s attacks. It is also one of the four oblasts Russia claims to have annexed in September 2022, although Ukrainian forces still control about a third of the oblast, including the regional capital. Russia has increased its air strikes on Zaporizhzhia, causing numerous civilian casualties and damaging infrastructure. Russian troops began using highly destructive guided aerial bombs against Zaporizhzhia for the first time on Sept. 23. Before that, the city was targeted only with missiles and drones.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-strikes-zaporizhzhia-injuring-10/	2024-10-19T14:29:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-19-15_23_27.jpeg
With US elections looming, Biden’s Berlin swan song was all talk, no action on Ukraine	Joe Biden&apos;s likely last European visit as president was billed as a final chance before the upcoming U.S. presidential election to meet with key world leaders, solidify long-term support for Ukraine, and work towards ending Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion launched over two and a half years ago. &quot;Ukraine faces a tough winter. We must sustain our resolve, our effort and our support,&quot; Biden told reporters before the talks in Berlin on Oct. 18, as cited by the Washington Post. &quot;I know the cost is heavy. Make no mistake, it pales in comparison to the cost of living in a world where aggression prevails, where large states attack and bully smaller ones &#x2014; simply because they can.&quot; However, according to a joint statement released by the White House, Paris, Berlin, and London, Ukraine&apos;s situation and support from Western allies seem to have largely remained the same as they were the day before Biden&apos;s trip to Germany. It offered no new pledges of game-changing support beyond current levels of weaponry provided or progress on key issues such as authorizing long-range strikes inside Russia with Western weapons, NATO membership, or implementation of other requests within President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s &quot;Victory Plan.&quot; Instead, it repeated condemnation of &quot;Russia&#x2019;s continued war of aggression against Ukraine&quot; and highlighted &quot;discussions&quot; of &quot;plans&quot; for &quot;additional security, economic, and humanitarian assistance.&quot; The vague and non-committal language from Ukraine&apos;s Western allies contrasts starkly with the increased diplomatic urgency that has consumed Kyiv in recent weeks. Yet the reasons behind both are almost certainly the same &#x2014; the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5, uncertainty about who will take over as leader of Ukraine&#x2019;s top Western ally, and how strong their backing for Kyiv will be. Recent polls show that in the approaching election, Biden&#x2019;s Vice President Kamala Harris, as the Democratic Party&#x2019;s candidate, is in a dead heat race with former U.S. President Donald Trump, who has questioned support for Ukraine and has a history of cozying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. For Kyiv, one fear is getting continued U.S. support under a Harris presidency coming at a pace even former NATO Chief Jens Stoltenberg has said was too slow and gradual. A bigger one is having support sharply cut under a Trump administration. Both scenarios have triggered Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials to intensify efforts to secure long-term defense support now and push allies to ease restrictions on the use of their weapons for strikes in Russia. So far, Zelensky&#x2019;s administration has had limited success. &quot;The elections are currently, as they usually do, holding U.S. politics hostage and until the conclusion of it, no significant legislative change can be expected,&quot; Benjamin Bardos, a transatlantic security expert from the Warsaw Institute, told the Kyiv Independent. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (R) greets U.S. President Joe Biden at the Chancellery on Oct. 18, 2024 in Berlin, Germany. (Maja Hitij/Getty Images)In late September, Zelensky met with Biden to present his five-point victory plan, which includes an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO before the war ends and authorization to strike deep inside Russia with Western long-range weapons. The plan also has three classified sections shared with international partners. Zelensky then toured Europe with the plan but has not yet secured the full support for the strategy from either American or European leaders. Just a week before Biden&#x2019;s visit, Zelensky also traveled to Germany, where he met with Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Following their meeting, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, and Norway unveiled an aid package for Ukraine worth 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion). But Berlin continues refusing to send long-range Taurus missiles or allow Ukraine to use German weapons to strike targets deep within Russia. &quot;We are supporting Ukraine as powerfully as we can and at the same time we are making sure that NATO does not become a party to the war, so that this war does not turn into an even bigger catastrophe,&quot; Scholz said in remarks to the press before the meeting with Biden on Oct. 18. Kurt Volker, former U.S. ambassador to NATO and special representative to Ukraine under Trump&#x2019;s first presidency, said Biden&apos;s trip had two main goals. The first was to show the American public that Europe also contributes significantly to help Ukraine in its existential fight against Russia. Trump, who has since his first presidency lambasted European countries for not contributing enough to their defense while relying instead on U.S. taxpayers as an umbrella of security, has repeatedly said that Europe should do more to end the war raging on their continent. The second goal, according to Volker, was to discuss with allies how they can strengthen the EU&apos;s defense industry and provide Ukraine with more weapons to counter Russia&#x2019;s vast military power. Volker emphasized Ukraine&#x2019;s urgent need for more ammunition, longer-range munitions, improved air defense systems, and additional support in the Black Sea. However, he expressed uncertainty about whether these priorities align with the Biden administration&#x2019;s plans given the looming elections. &quot;What Ukraine needs is fairly obvious, they need more ammunition and they need it more quickly, they need to use the munitions that we&apos;re giving them at longer range,&quot; Volker said. &quot;So those are all things that are on the Ukrainian list. It&apos;s just that I&apos;m not sure they&apos;re on the Biden administration&apos;s list that they intend to do,&quot; Volker added.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Oct. 17 that Biden planned to consult with German, French, and U.K. leaders on what they had discussed with Zelensky during his European tour. White House spokesperson John Kirby later said that Washington is still reviewing Ukraine&#x2019;s &quot;Victory Plan&quot; and expects to make further security commitments at the next meeting of Western allies within the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, also known as the regular Ramstein meetings. Biden had initially planned to visit Germany the prior weekend to take part in a Ramstein international meeting to coordinate aid to Ukraine. That trip was canceled due to Hurricane Milton in Florida. According to the White House, the Ramstein meeting has been rescheduled to be held online in November, though it&#x2019;s unclear if it will be before or after the U.S. elections. Catherine Sendak, director of the Transatlantic Defense and Security Program at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), said that Western leaders have and will continue to discuss which parts of Ukraine&#x2019;s &quot;Victory Plan&quot; they support or want to adjust. She added that the authorization for long-range strikes against Russia with Western-provided weapons is &quot;a hot topic.&quot; &quot;Because there&apos;s such a lull in parts of the conversation in the Western world about Ukraine due to (U.S.) elections and a lot of other things, hyper-focusing on this issue (aid to Ukraine) again in the fall, I think, is very important,&quot; said Sendak. U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during a joint press conference with the German Chancellor prior to a meeting at the Chancellery in Berlin, on Oct. 18, 2024. (Tobias Sschwarz/AFP)The U.S. has already indicated that Ukraine shouldn&apos;t expect a formal NATO invitation soon since there is still no consensus among allies. Although the latest NATO summit in the summer reaffirmed that Ukraine will join the military alliance, Sullivan said there is still &quot;work to do&quot; to get there, including &quot;reforms and security conditions being met.&quot; The reforms involve &quot;the institutionalization of the security support apparatus for Ukraine,&quot; Sullivan added. As Trump has indicated he would be more hesitant than Biden to provide military aid to Ukraine and suggested the U.S. should not defend NATO allies who don&#x2019;t pay their fair share, concerns have grown about potential global alliance shifts if he wins the presidency. When asked before the Berlin visit whether Biden has been &quot;Trump-proofing&quot; the U.S. government for a potential Trump presidency, Sullivan replied that Biden is working to make the U.S.&#x2019;s commitment to Ukraine &quot;sustainable and institutionalized for the long term.&quot; &quot;Since President Biden is not running for office, he doesn&apos;t need to be here in the United States campaigning. He has an opportunity to sit down with world leaders and really hash out some significant support and assistance,&quot; said Sendak. However, Biden&apos;s visit to Germany was never likely to yield major decisions on increasing support for Ukraine or implementing key points of Zelensky&apos;s &quot;Victory Plan,&quot; such as a NATO invitation or permission for long-range strikes, according to Volker. &quot;The main reason is the same as always &#x2014; fear of escalation. Fear that Russia would view this as NATO playing a direct role in attacking Russia, fear of nuclear usage&#x2026;,&quot; he said. His comments refer to the Biden administration&#x2019;s long-lasting fear of Russia pulling allies into the war, potentially by conducting nuclear missile strikes on Ukraine. Any significant decision to increase support for Ukraine will likely be postponed until after the U.S. election also because Biden&#x2019;s administration is wary of Trump accusing them of pushing the country into World War III, which could hurt Kamala Harris&#x2019;s campaign. &quot;It&#x2019;s not a serious argument. It&#x2019;s a political argument,&quot; Volker said of Trump&#x2019;s election campaign rhetoric that has claimed U.S. support for Ukraine against Russia&#x2019;s invasion risks escalation into a global war. Bardos pointed to a Republican backlash over Zelensky&#x2019;s September visit to Pennsylvania, a key swing state, as one reason why congressional approval for foreign aid is &quot;off the table&quot; for now. Instead, any short-term U.S. support will likely come from the Presidential Drawdown Authority, which had about $2.8 billion remaining for the fiscal year as of late September, according to Bardos. Emphasizing that U.S. assistance to Ukraine and involvement in European security would unlikely come to a grinding halt in case of a Trump presidency, Sendak said the EU should nonetheless take on a larger role in ensuring continued aid to Ukraine. But not enough efforts have been made to strengthen the union&#x2019;s defense industry, she added. Bardos cautioned that EU resources would not be sufficient without continued large support from the U.S. &quot;While the EU member states possess significant defense industries, it would be close to impossible for the EU alone to &#x2018;step up&#x2019; support and fill the role of the U.S. without a comprehensive overhaul of individual member states&#x2019; defense industries and forming a united front in the EU, which as far as current politics goes, is extremely unlikely,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/with-us-elections-looming-bidens-berlin-swan-song-was-all-talk-no-action-on-ukraine/	2024-10-19T11:52:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178315214.jpg
Ukraine’s NATO membership on 'irreversible path,' G7 defense ministers reaffirm	Defense ministers of the G7 countries reaffirmed their commitment to supporting Ukraine&apos;s integration into NATO, according to the joint statement following their meeting in Naples on Oct. 19. &quot;We support Ukraine on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership,&#x201D; the statement said. The ministers also pledged continued military assistance to Ukraine, both in the short and long term, and emphasized the importance of training and educational support for the Ukrainian Defense Forces. &quot;We welcome the respective efforts of NATO and the EU under the NATO Security Assistance and Training Program for Ukraine and the EU Military Assistance Mission,&quot; the document states. The ministers also confirmed their goal of achieving a &quot;comprehensive, just, and lasting peace&quot; that respects Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as set out by international law. However, the White House&#x2019;s position regarding Ukraine&#x2019;s accession has been that the invitation to NATO will likely not come in the short term, citing the need for reforms and fulfillment of security conditions. We are not at the stage where the Alliance is discussing issuing an invitation in the short term,&quot; U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said on Oct. 16 ahead of a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels, Voice of America reported. &quot;But, as always, we will continue talks with our friends in Ukraine about how they can move toward the Alliance,&quot; Smith added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-nato-membership-on-irreversible-path-g7-defense-ministers-reaffirm/	2024-10-19T11:49:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1256044350.jpg
US Intelligence Chairman urges immediate action on North Korean troop movements in Ukraine	U.S. Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Michael R. Turner appealed to U.S. President Joseph Biden on Oct. 18 to respond immediately to reports of North Korea&apos;s troops preparing to join Russia&apos;s army fighting in Ukraine. North Korea troops attacking Ukraine from Russia or entering Ukraine &#x201C;must be a red line for the United States and NATO,&quot; Turner said. Turner also cited public reports from Ukrainian and South Korean intelligence agencies that suggest North Korean troops may be moving via Russian naval vessels. Calling the situation &quot;alarming&quot; and a major escalation of the conflict, Turner urged the U.S. and NATO to act immediately. He requested an urgent classified briefing for the House Intelligence and Armed Services Committees, emphasizing the need for swift U.S. and NATO action to prevent a broader conflict. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said that the first group of 2,600 soldiers will be deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. He said that close to 11,000 North Korean troops are in Russia and will be &quot;ready to fight&quot; in Ukraine by Nov. 1.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-intelligence-chairman-urges-immediate-action-on-north-korean-troop-movements-in-ukraine/	2024-10-19T09:52:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157649988.jpg
Investigation: Russians carry out systemic terror in occupied part of Kherson Oblast	On the morning of Nov. 20, 2023, Russians came to Raisa Rusnak&#x2019;s home, looking for her 28-year-old son Ruslan. Four masked men threw him onto the ground and began beating him. &quot;Guys, what have I done to you? What do you want from me?&quot; Ruslan shouted. Those were the final words Raisa heard from her son. She never saw him alive again. Eight days later, she identified his body at the morgue. She was told that he had died of internal bleeding from a stomach ulcer during interrogation by the Russian occupation police. The woman is convinced that her son was tortured to death. Even the official Russian death certificate states that Ruslan died on the day of his detention &#x2014; a week before she was informed of her son&apos;s death. &quot;He was lying there&#x2026; His eyes were open, his teeth were showing. He must have died in such torment. What my child endured, I can&#x2019;t even imagine,&quot; Raisa said. Ruslan was interrogated at the former Ukrainian police station in the town of Hornostaivka, on the Dnipro River&apos;s east bank, in the Russian-occupied part of Kherson Oblast. Moscow has controlled this territory since 2022. Hornostaivka, a town with a pre-war population of about 6,500 people, was occupied in April 2022. Raisa left the town for Ukrainian-controlled territory in early 2024. In the police headquarters on Torhova Street in Hornostaivka, where Ruslan was taken, the Russian occupation police have been operating for two and a half years. The occupiers have established a torture chamber in this building. Ruslan is one of many Ukrainians taken there by the Russians and not the only one for whom it ended fatally. The fate of many others remains unknown. Russia has terrorized the local population in torture chambers across the occupied territories, with previous reports indicating the use of this tactic in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, as well as the previously occupied areas of Kherson Oblast.

Right: Ruslan Rusnak and his mother, Raisa Rusnak, who fled to Ukrainian-controlled territory in 2024. (Courtesy)One of those missing is Oleksandr Slisarenko, a local entrepreneur and volunteer in Hornostaivka. When the Russians took control of the town, his wife left, but he decided to stay and help others. &quot;He was responsible for a lot of people. He could not leave them. &#x2018;Maybe you could come here?&#x2019; I&#x2019;d ask him. &#x2018;No,&#x2019; he&#x2019;d say, &#x2018;I can&#x2019;t leave those grannies. It will get better soon,&#x2019;&quot; his wife Liudmyla recalls him saying. Liudmyla currently lives in Poland. Since leaving Hornostaivka in April 2022, she had kept in touch with her husband by phone and on messenger applications. But on Aug. 3, 2022, the connection was cut off: in the morning of that day, the occupiers took Oleksandr away. &quot;He went out into the yard to do some chores &#x2014; he came out in the same clothes he had slept in. And our house was, you could say, already surrounded. They tied his hands, put him on his knees, and began to torture him. He was beaten very badly on the spot. Witnesses saw it all. After that, he was thrown into a minibus with a bag over his head, and that was it,&quot; Liudmyla said. From that moment on, Oleksandr&#x2019;s trail was completely lost. Liudmyla does not even know if he was taken to the police station on Torhova Street. But she does know that it is common for Russians to imprison, interrogate, torture, and kill people there. Liudmyla told the Kyiv Independent that another victim of the Russian occupiers in Hornostaivka is Volodymyr Ruchka, a driver from the local health inspection service. He was also taken to the police station on Torhova Street in the first year of the occupation. &#x201C;He just said something, something they didn&#x2019;t like. They took him to the police station and beat him up. He was beaten, released, and he died the next day.&#x201D; The map shows the Dnipro River that divides Ukraine&apos;s southern Kherson Oblast into Russian-occupied territory east of the river and Ukrainian-controlled territory west of the river. Hornostaivka, a town with a pre-war population of 6,500 people, has been occupied since April 2022. (The Kyiv Independent)&#xA0;We learned similar stories from other residents of Hornostaivka who were able to leave. At present, interviewing such witnesses is the only way to learn about Russian war crimes in the occupied territories. The east bank of Kherson Oblast is under tight control, and no one but Russians have access to it: neither independent law enforcement agencies, nor documentarians, nor journalists. In the course of our investigation into Russian terror in the occupied territories, we interviewed dozens of people who managed to leave &#x2014; some of them as recently as the summer of 2024. Most of them asked for anonymity or refused to be interviewed out of fear of the Russians. Almost all of them have relatives or friends left in the occupation who could face retaliation for these testimonies. One woman from Hornostaivka told the Kyiv Independent that a story similar to that of Volodymyr Ruchka happened in the summer of 2023 with another man, Serhii Klopot. &#x201C;He was taken right from the market. They dragged him out of the store at the market, threw him into a minibus, and two days later, he was brought to his yard and dumped. His neighbors picked him up. Two days later, he died. He was beaten very badly,&#x201D; she said. She also said that shortly thereafter a group of Russian police officers, one of whom introduced himself as &quot;Vladimir,&quot; threatened her with meeting Klopot&apos;s fate. According to this woman, the Russians mainly persecuted former Ukrainian soldiers and weapons owners. Anyone who showed a pro-Ukrainian position could also be persecuted. However, other witnesses added that the Russians also terrorized business owners who could be deprived of their property. This was a particularly common practice during the first year of the occupation. &quot;Those who had businesses were detained for the purpose of ransom and so on. It was always solved the same way: you bring money, they let you go. People&apos;s cars were taken away in the middle of the night, they came, broke into garages and drove cars away, houses were robbed,&quot; said Henadii Kryzhanovskyi, an entrepreneur from Hornostaivka who agreed to speak to us openly. Kryzhanovskyi, too, was held in the building on Torhova Street in the fall of 2022. He was released only after he signed a statement about the transfer of his cars for the needs of Russia&#x2019;s so-called &quot;special military operation.&quot; He was able to leave the occupied territories only in July 2024.

After occupying Hornostaivka in April 2022, Russian occupation forces have turned the police headquarters into a torture chamber. (Courtesy)Kryzhanovskyi was not the only one forced by the Russians to &quot;voluntarily&quot; give up his property. Others include the pastor of the Baptist church in Hornostaivka, Oleksandr Maltsev. In the fall of 2022, Russian forces searched the church premises, and Maltsev himself was taken to Torhova Street. He spent a little over two weeks in detention and was forced to give away his two cars. Residents of Hornostaivka also told us that people not only from the town but also from neighboring villages and towns and even from the cities of Kakhovka and Nova Kakhovka, located tens of kilometers away, were brought to and held in the police station on Torhova Street. Olha (name changed) from the village of Kairy, eight kilometers from Hornostaivka, said that the Russians also took residents of her village to the police station on Torhova Street. &#x201C;They abducted people, tortured them and beat them. And as far as I know, those people were hit with everything, even electrocuted. They tortured them like that because they (Russians) wanted to show us that they were the masters and we were the simple people who must obey them. People said: they&#x2019;ve tried everything, except for one &#x2014; putting electrodes under the nails,&#x201D; said the woman who left Kairy in the summer of 2024. Olha also said that Russians could punish Ukrainians in the village even for saying &#x201C;Glory to Ukraine,&#x201D; a Ukrainian national salute. The screenshot from a video published by a Russian propaganda media outlet showing the Vladimir Lenin statue in Russian-occupied Hornostaivka, Kherson Oblast.&#xA0;&quot;One man was taken by the arms and taken away. A week later, maybe a little more, we were told that he was found, and that they had killed him. Another woman had a birthday, was a little drunk, went to the store, and said, &apos;Glory to Ukraine, Glory to the Heroes.&apos; The Russian soldiers looked at each other, did not touch her at first. When the woman had just crossed the threshold to leave the store, they took her by her arms and stuffed her into a car... And I don&apos;t know whether she is alive or not, because the woman is missing too,&#x201D; Olha said. All of the testimonies we gathered paint a picture of systemic terror, with its epicenter in the torture chamber in Hornostaivka. This terror apparently began in August 2022 &#x2014; and continues to this day. Ruslan Rusnak, who was most likely tortured to death on Torhova Street in November 2023, was not the only one taken by the Russians in the town at that time. The same month, brothers Ivan and Anton Shtepa, as well as Denys Shum, were held there, too. It is not known where they are now. It was the case of Ruslan Rusnak that allowed us to identify the Russian police officers involved in his death and the terror of the local population. In February 2024, one of the Russian anonymous Telegram channels reported that in connection with his death, Russian law enforcement agencies were prosecuting five police officers from Hornostaivka for &#x201C;abuse of office.&#x201D; The message included the names and initials of these police officers. It was easy enough to identify one of them &#x2014; Andrey Polevshchikov, who was the head of the Russian police department in occupied Hornostaivka at the time of Ruslan Rusnak&apos;s death. A man very similar to him can be seen in a video shot in the town back in August 2023. In October, he spoke to a Russian propaganda media outlet about the work of the police. &quot;Citizens are happy to cooperate with the police because they see us as a helping hand. Initially, of course, you could see that the population was cautious of police officers, but when they saw our work in action, they welcomed us,&quot; Polevshchikov said in the video. Andrey Polevshchikov, the former head of the Russian police department in occupied Hornostaivka, speaks to a Russian propaganda media outlet in Hornostaivka, Kherson Oblast, in August 2023. (The Kyiv Independent)Other names mentioned in this message from the anonymous Telegram channel were &quot;V. Pliukhin, V. Merkurov, I. Pimenov, and A. Denisov.&quot; We were able to identify Russian policemen Igor Pimenov and Vasily Merkurov but found no confirmed connection to Hornostaivka. In the case of &quot;V. Pliukhin,&quot; we decided to try out the name &quot;Vladimir&quot; (&quot;Volodymyr&quot; in Ukrainian) as standing for &quot;V,&quot; since several residents of Hornostaivka gave us this name in connection with the terror of Russian police officers. This is how we learned about Volodymyr Pliukhin, a former Ukrainian police officer from Zaporizhzhia Oblast who defected to Russia at the beginning of the full-scale invasion. In the video mentioned earlier, Polevshchikov says, among other things, that a police officer from Zaporizhzhia Oblast has joined the staff of the Hornostaivka police station. We showed a photo of Volodymyr Pliukhin, found on the Internet, to several residents of Hornostaivka. Two of them recognized the policeman as the one who had participated in the terror in the town. One witness pointed out that this person was the &quot;Vladimir&quot; who threatened her with the fate of Serhii Klopot, who was tortured to death. Another witness, who was imprisoned in the police station of Hornostaivka, told us that this man was guarding the captives in Torhova Street in December 2022 &#x2014; and said to them that he was from Zaporizhzhia Oblast.

(The Kyiv Independent)We also learned the developments of the &quot;abuse of office&quot; charge against these policemen. Under the pretense of an association of former Russian police officers, we called Polevshchikov and offered to support him. He told us that the case had been opened on Feb. 1, 2024, almost two and a half months after Ruslan Rusnak&apos;s death. However, according to Polevshchikov, he no longer needs any help. &quot;The case has already been suspended. It will be terminated due to the injury. I signed a (military) contract and joined the &#x2018;special military operation.&#x2019; I&apos;m home already with an injured arm and leg. We came across a landmine,&quot; Polevshchikov told us in a phone conversation. He added that all the employees of the Russian-run Hornostaivka police station who had been prosecuted in the case joined the military and were wounded in action with him. By signing contracts to participate in the Russian-Ukrainian war and being &quot;wounded in action,&quot; the Russian policemen from Hornostaivka, in fact, avoided any responsibility for Ruslan Rusnak&apos;s death. When Raisa Rusnak learned of the Russian law enforcement investigation into her son&apos;s death, she did not believe in Russian justice. &quot;I think it was just a pretense, that&apos;s all,&quot; she told us. There are no great hopes for the official Ukrainian investigation, either. Law enforcement officers can&apos;t enter the occupied territory, they don&apos;t have access to the bodies to conduct all the necessary forensic examinations, and they can&apos;t interview witnesses on the spot. As for interviewing people who have managed to leave, they often face the same obstacle as journalists and documenters: people are too afraid to testify. Meanwhile, Russian terror continues on the occupied east bank of Kherson Oblast. And though some residents were lucky to have managed to flee, it is notoriously difficult for Ukrainians to leave the occupied territory. Ruslan Rusnak tried to do so in 2022, but the Russians would not let him out because of his former service in the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Hennadii Kryzhanovskyi, an entrepreneur from Hornostaivka, was able to leave on his second attempt. Olha from the village of Kairy managed to leave with her husband and children. But while crossing the border, Russians beat her husband and threatened him with murder and her with sexual violence. Even those who leave the occupied territories often deal with the trauma from Russian terror, either from what they have experienced themselves or from what their relatives and friends have endured.

His other grandfather has been dead for some time. I want Oleksandr to see his grandson grow up,&quot; she said, barely holding back tears. For Raisa Rusnak, the Russian occupation terror took away her son, her home, and justice, leaving nothing but nightmares. &quot;I moved to my daughter&apos;s place and have given her no rest. I have cried day and night. I imagine how they are killing my child, and I get scared. In my nightmares, I now see my daughter being abducted or my second son taken away. And I scream at night, I disturb everyone&apos;s sleep. I cry and scream at night. That&apos;s it.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/investigation-russians-carry-out-systemic-terror-in-occupied-part-of-kherson-oblast/	2024-10-19T09:29:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-19-at-17_54_12.jpg
At least 102 Ukrainian POWs executed by Russia, ombudsman says	Russian forces have executed at least 102 Ukrainian prisoners of war since 2022, Ukraine&apos;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said in an interview on Oct. 18, citing data from the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. According to Lubinets, the actual number of such cases is likely much higher since it is difficult to document Russian war crimes without supporting evidence such as videos of the executions. There have been multiple reports of executions of Ukrainian POWs by Russian soldiers over this year. Videos and photos resurfaced on social media with evidence of the crimes, including drone footage showing the shooting of the POWs as they surrendered to Russian troops, as well as videos and photos with bodies of Ukrainian soldiers suggesting torture and violent death in captivity. Lubinets said that Ukrainian authorities document the cases as much as possible and pass the evidence to the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation. &quot;In my opinion, the main reason (for the executions) is that the Russian military does everything possible so that Russian soldiers have no desire to surrender to Ukraine,&quot; Lubinets said. Apart from that, Russians kill prisoners to demonstrate their disregard for international law, according to Lubinets. &quot;They want to show that they are not going to be punished for it (by the international community),&quot; he added. &quot;This is a deliberate policy of Russia, but international organizations turn a blind eye,&quot; Lubinets said. &quot;I see no public or legal reaction to these events - there are still no arrest warrants for war criminals,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/102-ukrainian-pows-executed-by-russia-ombudsman-says/	2024-10-19T08:12:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2037955866.jpg
Romania says drone breached its airspace during Russia's attack on Ukraine	An unidentified flying object was detected by Romanian radar systems near the Black Sea during Russia&apos;s overnight attack on Ukraine on Oct. 19, the Romanian Defense Ministry said. It is the second time this week that Romanian airspace has been violated, following the incident only a day ago, when Romania and Belarus scrambled jets in response to targets flying in their airspace during the Russian drone attack on Ukraine late on Oct. 17. On Oct. 19, Romania once again scrambled two F-16 fighter jets and two Spanish F-18s that are used for air policing missions in the country. In both incidents, the targets disappeared from the radars before the pilots could find them. Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu said on Oct. 18 that the incident could have been a cyber attack against the country&apos;s defense system since &quot;pilots did not have visual contact with the drone.&quot; Russia launched up to 98 drones and six missiles against Ukraine on Oct. 19, injuring people and causing destruction that led to power outages in three Ukrainian regions. &#xA0; Romania, a NATO member, has reported numerous incidents when its airspace was violated over the course of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine and condemned Russia&apos;s attacks on Ukraine as violations of international law. Over the past year, debris from Russian drones were found on the Romanian territory as Russia carried out attacks targeting Ukrainian infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/romania-says-drone-breached-its-airspace-during-russias-attack-on-ukraine/	2024-10-19T07:28:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1779469255.jpg
Russian major killed by car bomb in occupied Luhansk, Ukraine's intelligence claims	Russian Major Dmitriy Pervukha was killed in the center of Russian-occupied Luhansk after his car exploded, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said on Oct. 19. &quot;On Oct. 18, 2024, at about 11:40 a.m., a UAZ Patriot car exploded&quot; on one of the streets in Luhansk, HUR said on Telegram. Pervukha was inside the car, according to HUR. Pervukha was allegedly involved in war crimes against Ukraine. He served in the 273rd Intelligence Center of the Russian Armed Forces , located in Russia&apos;s Novosibirsk. In the occupied territories of Ukraine, Pervukha held the position of the so-called &#x201C;chief of staff for military service and security of military service,&#x201D; according to HUR. Russian Investigative Committee announced that a criminal case was opened on Oct. 18 to investigate the explosion that killed an unnamed man and wounded a woman in another car. While HUR called Pervukha &quot;a war criminal&quot; and said that every crime against Ukraine would be &quot;justly punished,&quot; it didn&apos;t claim responsibility for the attack. Since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, numerous assasinations of Russian military commanders, officials, and collaborators via car bombs were reported in the Russian-occupied Crimea, parts of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-major-killed-by-car-bomb-in-occupied-luhansk-ukraines-intelligence-claims/	2024-10-19T06:06:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/gur-pervukh-2.jpg
Russian attacks kill 4 people over the past day, cause power outages in 3 Ukrainian regions	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least four people and injured at least 20 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Oct. 19. Ukrainian air defenses downed 4 out of 6 guided air missiles Kh-59/69 and 42 attack drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Forty-six drones were countered by electronic warfare means. In total, over 100 air targets were detected by Ukrainian forces during the Russian attack. Ukraine&apos;s Energy Ministry reported on the morning of Oct. 19 that over 73,000 consumers in three oblasts were left without electricity due to Russia&apos;s recent attacks. Ukrainian officials have warned that Moscow is preparing to carry out strikes against Ukrainian nuclear facilities ahead of the winter months, as it seeks to plunge the country into a lasting cold aimed at breaking Ukrainians&apos; resolve. Between March and August of this year, Russia also destroyed all thermal power plants and almost all hydroelectric capacity in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 25 during his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. On Oct. 19, Russia launched a missile and drone attack against Cherkasy Oblast in the center of Ukraine, killing an elderly woman in Uman district and hitting a critical infrastructure facility, said Governor Ihor Taburets. In Donetsk Oblast, two people were killed and two more wounded in Russian strikes in Kurakhovo and Hirnyk, said Governor Vadym Filashkin. Russian attacks also wounded nine people in Kherson Oblast, hitting residential buildings, educational and medical facilities, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. In Sumy Oblast, a man&apos;s body was found under the rubble of a building in Shostka following three aviation bomb strikes overnight, the regional prosecutor&apos;s office reported. Eight other people were wounded, including five rescuers from the local emergency service department that was hit by Russia. At the time of the attack, emergency workers were at the shelter, the Ukrainian State Emergency Service said. In Kyiv, one woman was wounded by a piece of shrapnel from the drone attack overnight, said Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko. In Odesa, a missile strike caused a fire in a residential area of the city, damaging a three-story residential building and 10 houses, Odesa Oblast Governor Oleh Kiper said. No casualties were reported. In Chernihiv Oblast, the Russian strike hit an infrastructure facility, causing fire, Governor Viacheslav Chaus reported. Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts also came under attack, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-4-people-over-the-past-day/	2024-10-19T04:45:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/odesa-kiper.jpg
Puzzle company Frisson helps Ukrainians escape wartime reality	Editor&#x2019;s note: This article is part of a series of profiles highlighting successful Ukrainian startups and businesses. The series is funded by the regional investment fund Ukraine-Moldova American Enterprise Fund (UMAEF) and created in partnership with Spend With Ukraine, a non-profit organization that launched a platform to showcase businesses with Ukrainian roots and provide one more meaningful way to support Ukraine &#x2013; by choosing to spend with Ukraine. The series&#x2019; sponsors are not involved in the editorial process of the writing of these profiles. As a child, Kseniya Morozenko would piece together cut-up postcards at her grandmother&#x2019;s home in Donetsk Oblast. Years later, Morozenko was stuck at her apartment in Kyiv during the Covid-19 pandemic and remembered the homemade jigsaw puzzles from her childhood. She searched in shops in Ukraine, but could only find jigsaws for children, which gave her the idea to set up Frisson, a puzzle company featuring Ukrainian artwork geared towards adults. &#x201C;I want to support Ukrainian modern art and contemporary artists and show their work through puzzles,&#x201D; she told the Kyiv Independent at a trendy bookshop in Kyiv that sells Frisson&#x2019;s products. The puzzles are elegantly packaged with the pieces wrapped inside an environmentally-friendly mesh bag and bundled with two coasters, a postcard, a note, and a poster of the design. Morozenko says she was inspired by Apple&#x2019;s boxing and spent a long time crafting the packaging, including hand-stitching the first 200 mesh bags herself. In 2020, the market was wide open for Frisson as no one else was doing anything like it in Ukraine. Morozenko, who had spent nine years working as a client manager with Ukrainian brands, invested $5,000 of her own money into the project and is a one-man team, although she recently hired a social media manager. By the summer of 2021, nine months after Morozenko conceived the idea, Frisson began producing its first jigsaws in Kharkiv, Ukraine&#x2019;s printing mecca. The first puzzle retailed for Hr 500 ($12) and featured one of Morozenko&#x2019;s favorite murals in Kyiv painted by artists Viktoriya Lime and Andrii Kovtun. (L-R) Ksenia Morozenko, a founder of Frisson holds Frisson products. (Maryna Khmarka / Frisson)Supporting artistsMorozenko now has a queue of artists wanting to work with Frisson but she only selects those who are involved with charity projects. So far, the company has worked with 15 artists on 22 designs, including large 500-piece puzzles and smaller 100-piece postcard jigsaws, which are all made with recycled materials. Many of the artists have a notable following in Ukraine, including the globally-known artist and muralist Waone, and the designs often sell out quickly as they are limited to a run of 200. The artists set the price themselves, starting at $100, and Morozenko pays them upfront, particularly now with the uncertainty of war. &#x201C;You never know what will happen tomorrow,&#x201D; she said. Frisson has sold over 3,000 puzzles via its online store and 20 shops across Ukraine, including Kyiv, Odesa, Kharkiv, and smaller cities like Uzhhorod and Ivano-Frankivsk. Morozenko also hauls jigsaws to artisan markets and makes specially commissioned pieces for companies. With the larger puzzles retailing for Hr 700 ($17) and the smaller ones for Hr 300 ($7), Morozenko wants to spread the work of established artists to a bigger audience. &#x201C;The puzzles make art accessible to everyone,&#x201D; she said. Foreign artists have also contacted Morozenko, eager to work with Frisson. She is contemplating the idea, but says she will only work with artists from countries that are supportive of Ukraine like Lithuania, Canada, and the U.K. While Frisson is becoming more popular abroad, with orders from the U.S. and Australia, most customers are in Ukraine where Morozenko has spent the last few years building up a &#x201C;puzzle culture&#x201D; for grown-ups.

(Olha Rudnieva / Frisson)Like the puzzle boom during the Covid-19 pandemic, many Ukrainians are seeking comfort and escape from the brutal reality through jigsaws. At the start of the full-scale invasion, one of Frisson&#x2019;s most popular designs featured a group of friends enjoying a picnic. &#x201C;People ordered it as a gift and sent it to their friends with a postcard saying, &#x201C;Imagine it&apos;s us after our victory.&#x201D; I would sign and personalize the postcard,&#x201D; Morozenko said. The puzzles have also helped veterans. The company partnered with the Superhumans Center in Lviv for wounded soldiers and Morozenko says the jigsaws help with both physical and mental rehabilitation. One soldier even completed the puzzle with his prosthetic arm, surprising the doctors who didn&#x2019;t believe it was possible to clasp the small pieces. &#x201C;I just cried after seeing that,&#x201D; Morozenko said. At the outbreak of the war, Morozenko had to shut down printing operations in Kharkiv as Russian troops attempted to besiege the city. For two months she searched for a new printing facility, eventually finding one in Lviv after a tip from another company making puzzles. Frisson still had stockpiles of puzzles from the Kharkiv printing factory and began sending 50% of the money from sales to the Armed Forces. Morozenko strongly believes that every Ukrainian company should help the war effort and Frisson has a collection of charity puzzles with half of the proceeds going to NGOs or the army. The company also ships free jigsaws to organizations that help orphaned children and displaced people. Morozenko wants to bring people together through her puzzles and her slogan &#x201C;Better Together&#x201D; is proudly printed on the front of every box. With success at home, Morozenko is preparing to expand into the foreign market too. So far, the Ukrainian diaspora in countries like the U.K. and Canada has brought Frisson&#x2019;s puzzles but Morozenko wants to expand further. L: A hnd holding one of the Frisson products.

The program, launched by the Ukrainian government and USAID, will train and mentor companies on how to set up online Etsy stores and open doors to foreign markets. In addition to jigsaws, Morozenko also knits and sells anti-stress balls and coasters, while also signing postcards, personalized notes, and running between different artisan markets. Despite managing the company entirely by herself, with the occasional helping hand from friends who model for photoshoots, Morozenko finds the inspiration to keep going from the artists and organizations she works with. &#x201C;If they don&#x2019;t stop, how could I?&#x201D; she said. Frisson turns peaceful moments into artful experiences through its unique jigsaw puzzles, created in partnership with well-known Ukrainian artists. During these tough times, Frisson provides a sense of solace to Ukrainians, including veterans in rehabilitation.

MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak: Developments in Ukraine’s parliament on economic reforms, international obligations — Issue 77	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 77 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief&#x201D; newsletter, covering events from Oct. 7- Oct. 13, 2024. The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. The parliament adopted in the final reading the draft law on tax increase. On Oct. 10, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, adopted in the final reading draft law #11416-d to increase taxes. However, one key amendment which included all major suggestions from the Tax Committee was rejected during the voting. Particularly the norm which enables the draft law to come into force retrospectively from October 1. For example, it seems that the increase of military levy will be applied only after the draft law is signed and published that will decrease expected revenues from its adoption. The draft law also provides in 2024 50% of income tax for banks as a windfall tax, although the NBU, the IMF, and the Finance Ministry were against this. During the revision, lawmakers slightly relaxed the burden of the law by saving the military levy at 1.5% for military service people. Overall, the draft law is expected to bring around Hr 25-30 billion ($600&#x2013;700 million) of additional budget revenues this year and Hr 150-160 billion ($3.6&#x2013;$3.9 billion) in 2025. After the adoption, some of the lawmakers submitted 13 resolutions to cancel the decision of the parliament. However, on Oct. 14, the Rada rejected all resolutions and unblocked the opportunity for the speaker to sign the draft law. It has been already sent to the Office of the President for signing. The Parliament adopted a draft law needed to fulfill the obligation to increase the number of the HACC&#x2019;s members. The Verkhovna Rada adopted in the final reading draft law #11426 to prolong the mandate of the Public Council of International Experts (PCIE) which will vet candidates to the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) till the end of selection process but no later than Nov. 1, 2025. This step is needed given the PCIE&#x2019;s expiry in October 2024, as more time is needed to finish the ongoing selection process of new HACC judges. The adoption of the draft law implements the EU recommendations, soft commitments to the IMF and will make a necessary step for Ukraine to be able to fulfill the obligations of the Ukraine Facility to increase the number of HACC&#x2019;s members (with the deadline set for the first quarter 2025). The Parliament considered two draft laws required by the Ukraine Plan. Last week the Verkhovna Rada adopted in the final reading draft law #11310 on the basic principles of state climate policy which is one of the obligations under the Ukraine Facility financial mechanism. Moreover, the Parliament adopted in the first reading the resubmitted revised draft law on plea agreements #12039. The new draft was supported by SAPO and NABU. The new provisions of the draft law allow for a shorter prison term than currently required in case of cooperation with the investigation through exposure of accomplices and compensation for damage. For example, five years of imprisonment instead of eight years. At the same time, the court will be able to determine a large fine up to Hr 102 million ($2.4 million) as an additional punishment and confiscate the property. What is important, that this mechanism can&#x2019;t be applied as a general rule to organizers of corruption schemes, with the exception of cases in which such an organizer exposes another organizer. Ukrainska Pravda reports systematic pressure from the Presidential Office. Last week, one of the key independent Ukrainian media outlets Ukrainska Pravda released an official statement to report the ongoing and systematic pressure of the Presidential Office on the editorial team and certain journalists of Ukrainska Pravda. In particular, the media accused the office of blocking officials from communicating with Ukrainska Pravda journalists and participating in events; pressure on businesses to stop advertising cooperation with Ukrainska Pravda; openly emotionally-charged communication between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukrainska Pravda journalist Roman Kravets during the public press conference.	https://kyivindependent.com/mp-yaroslav-zhelezniak-developments-in-ukraines-parliament-on-economic-reforms-international-obligations-issue-77/	2024-10-19T03:26:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178721575.jpg
Ukraine state-owned enterprises weekly — Issue 151	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This is issue 151 of Ukrainian State-Owned Enterprises Weekly, covering events from Oct. 6-12, 2024. The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission. Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s CEO Yevhen Liashchenko filed a resignation letter, the company&#x2019;s supervisory board said on Oct. 7. The board added that it planned to consider the resignation according to the applicable procedures in the coming days. There was no news on the results of that consideration at the time of writing. Formally, for Ukrzaliznytsia, it was the Cabinet of Ministers that decided on CEO appointments and dismissals on proposal of the supervisory board, meaning that Cabinet could not appoint or dismiss the CEO without such a proposal. The SOE law changed significantly in February 2024 (see our Issue 120), and it is the supervisory board&#x2019;s exclusive power now. As we wrote in Issue 80, on March 21, 2023, the Cabinet of Ministers appointed Yevhen Liashchenko as Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s new CEO for the next two years to replace Oleksandr Kamyshin, who had become the new strategic industries minister. In September 2024, Kamyshin stepped down from his ministerial post and is now a presidential advisor and member of Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s supervisory board (see our Issue 146). Previously, Liashchenko served as Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s executive board member, responsible for finance. There were no public comments from Liashchenko on his resignation; however, several reputable media &#x2014; including Ekonomichna Pravda (EP) and Forbes Ukraine &#x2014; suggested several possible reasons. According to EP, the resignation coincided with the appointment of Oleksiy Kuleba as the new deputy prime minister for restoration &#x2014; minister for communities and territories development, who is now responsible infrastructure sector, and Kamyshin&#x2019;s return to Ukrzaliznytsia as a supervisory board member. After his resignation, Liashchenko would return to the position of an executive board member until the end of his contract, i.e., for another six months, the media outlet added. According to EP&#x2019;s sources, the reason for Liashchenko&#x2019;s resignation is also connected with Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s new priorities, primarily to raise funds for capital investments, including the modernization of the company&#x2019;s infrastructure and rolling stock. Forbes Ukraine&#x2019;s sources also confirmed this. &#x201C;Liashchenko was supposed to stabilize the company, and he did that. Now the company faces new challenges and needs a different person. Ukrzaliznytsia needs a completely different pace of change. It needs to accelerate,&#x201D; the media&#x2019;s source at the Cabinet of Ministers said. One of the possible reasons for Liashchenko&#x2019;s resignation is that he failed to adequately communicate the need for raising freight tariffs to businesses. Without this, Ukrzaliznytsia would not be able to achieve financial stability, the source added. As we reported in Issue 72, Ukrzaliznytsia incurred losses of Hr 10.8 billion in 2022 (318 million euros at that time). The loss from passenger transportation was Hr 13.3 billion (391 million euros at the time), suggesting that the company&#x2019;s other segments, such as cargo transportation, made a profit of Hr 2.5 billion (73 million euros). As we wrote in Issue 80, in March 2023, after his appointment as Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s new CEO for the next two years, Liashchenko got several key tasks, one of which was for the company to break even. In September 2023, Liashchenko said that Ukrzaliznytsia was reaching break-even and would finish the first nine months of 2023 with a profit (see Issue 103). Ultimately, the company finished 2023 with a net profit of Hr 5 billion ($121 million). See Issue 127 for more detail. On Nov. 20 2023, the Cabinet of Ministers approved Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s financial plan for 2024, with forecast losses of Hr 12.6 billion (&#x20AC;323 million). See Issue 112 for more detail. As we wrote in September, Liashchenko said that Ukrzaliznytsia made a profit of up to Hr 3 billion ($72 million) in the first half of 2024, but lost Hr 600-700 million ($14-16 million) in July-August and expected a minor loss by the end of 2024 due to a decline in profitable types of cargo. See Issue 146 for more detail. According to EP, liga.net, and Forbes Ukraine, Oleksandr Pertsovskyi, head of the company&#x2019;s passenger business (and executive board member), is likely to become the new CEO. Pertsovskyi could be appointed as soon as this week, liga.net added. According to EP, in addition to Liashchenko, other changes are expected on Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s executive board: Two seats would be cut, with these officers moving to other positions within the company. The number of executive board members would be reduced from eight to seven, with the above two positions replaced by a member in charge of HR, the media outlet wrote. Since an independent supervisory board was established at Ukrzaliznytsia in 2018, the company has seen six CEO changes. Much of this six-year period, the company was managed by acting CEOs. Since its establishment in late 2020, the SOE Weekly has covered the four most recent CEO changes at Ukrzaliznytsia. See our Issues 19, 39, and 80 for more detail. Ukrzaliznytsia requires substantial long-term transformation and faces several challenges. These include unbundling its different businesses, such as cargo and passenger services. It must also address its implicit public service obligation, as passenger transportation is currently loss-making and is cross-subsidised by cargo revenues. Additionally, the company needs to renew its worn-out fixed assets and prepare for competition once private companies are allowed to provide locomotive services. In addition, Ukrzaliznytsia faces wartime challenges, including the assignment to evacuate people from areas near the frontline. To handle these issues, the company needs a permanent CEO with a long-term planning horizon. The selection of Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s new supervisory board has not started, despite legal requirements. As we wrote almost three years ago, the Cabinet approved members of the railway operator&#x2019;s supervisory board on Dec. 29 2021 (see our Issue 60). Anatoliy Amelin, Alexander Doll, Jakub Karnowski, and Gebhard Hafer became independent members, while Serhiy Leshchenko, Serhiy Moskalenko and David Lomjaria were appointed as state representatives on the board. According to the law effective at the time of appointment, as well the company&#x2019;s charter, the maximum term of office of supervisory board members is three years. Thus, the tenure of the above supervisory board should expire on Dec. 28, 2024. Since 2021, only the recent appointment of Oleksandr Kamyshin as a supervisory board member of Ukrzaliznytsia (state representative) has been known publicly. According to media reports, Kamyshin replaced Serhiy Moskalenko in this position. At the same time, the mandatory disclosures that joint-stock companies must make according to the capital markets law and disclosure regulations of the National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC), are not available on Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s website. In particular, the information on company officers, such as the management and supervisory board, is missing. Also, according to the new requirements of the SOE law (which were introduced by Law No. 3587, effective March 8 &#x2014; see our Issue 122), the selection of supervisory board candidates for an SOE must begin no later than three months before the respective supervisory board member&#x2019;s term of office ends (unless a decision has been made to extend his/her term of office), or no later than 10 days from the day of his/her early termination of powers. The SOE law now also requires that such selections must follow the principles of collective suitability, board diversity, equality of requirements, professionalism, openness, and transparency. This means that the Cabinet, as Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s ownership entity, should have made a decision &#x2014; by Sept. 29 &#x2014; to either extend the powers of the current supervisory board members or announce a selection of board members. PrivatBank appoints a new CEO. On Oct. 7, PrivatBank announced that its supervisory board had elected Mikael Bjorknert (Sweden) as the bank&#x2019;s new CEO, following a competitive selection that included high-calibre candidates from both Ukraine and abroad. Bj&#xF6;rknert&#x2019;s candidacy is pending approval by the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU). The bank said that Bj&#xF6;rknert has over 25 years of experience in the financial sector. Most recently, he served as head of Swedish Banking at Swedbank. Before joining Swedbank, Bj&#xF6;rknert held the position of Chairman of the Board at Swedish Bankgirot, Head of Global Transaction Services at SEB Bank, and Member of the Board at Nasdaq (Sweden). At PrivatBank, Bjorknert will focus on advancing the bank&#x2019;s customer-centric model, accelerating digital initiatives, and ensuring future-proofing, the bank added. Preparing the bank for privatization is not listed among Bjorknert&#x2019;s tasks, as it was for PrivatBank&#x2019;s current CEO, Gerhard Bosch. As we reported in late June 2024, Bosch filed his resignation notice. According to EP, the unofficial reason was the discrepancy between the tasks assigned to Bosch and the reality: When Bosch was elected as PrivatBank&#x2019;s CEO in May 2021, his tasks included preparing the bank for privatization. However, during the full-scale war, this process was put on hold, EP wrote. See Issue 138 for more detail. As we wrote in September 2024, Bosch&#x2019;s contract would be terminated on Nov. 1. Forbes Ukraine then wrote that unless the winner of the competitive selection for the new CEO is determined by that time, one of the executive board members would start managing the bank as an acting CEO. (See Issue 147 for more detail.) However, if Bjorknert is cleared by the NBU, PrivatBank will not require an interim CEO, with its competitive selection appropriately completed on time. Competitive selection for three independent members for Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board announced. On Oct. 10, the Economy Ministry announced that the SOE Nomination Committee approved the candidate requirements. The deadline to apply is Oct. 31. As we wrote in Issue 146, on Sept. 2, Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board dismissed the company&#x2019;s CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi by a majority vote. The board appointed executive board member Oleksii Brekht as an acting CEO and decided to hold a competitive selection for a new CEO. On the same day, Daniel Dobbeni (independent member and supervisory board chair) and Peder Andreasen (independent member) announced that they had filed their resignation notices. &#x201C;We strongly believe that the decision on the early dismissal of the CEO of Ukrenergo is politically motivated and, based on the results of the presented report, there are no valid grounds for it,&#x201D; they said in a statement. Currently, Roman Pionkowski is the only remaining independent member of the supervisory board of Ukrenergo. He was appointed together with other independent members in December 2021, meaning that his term of office should expire in December 2024. On Sept. 10, Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reached a staff-level agreement on the fifth review of the four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Arrangement. Subject to approval by the IMF Executive Board, Ukraine will have access to about $1.1 billion. According to the IMF&#x2019;s release, the full supervisory board of Ukrenergo should be re-established by end-December 2024. As we wrote in Issue 148, on Sept. 20, the Energy Ministry [in its capacity as Ukrenergo&#x2019;s general shareholders meeting decided to hold a competitive selection for three independent members of the company&#x2019;s supervisory board. The fourth independent member will be elected in parallel under a previously launched procedure, the ministry added back then. According to Ukrenergo&#x2019;s charter, its supervisory board should consist of seven members: four independent members and three state representatives. As we reported in June 2023, the Cabinet still had to select and approve one independent member for Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board. Hence, independent members did not constitute a majority of the board, which did not meet the requirements of the law or Ukrenergo&#x2019;s charter. See our Issue 95 for more detail. As we reported in April 2024 (Issue 129), the Economy Ministry announced a competitive selection to find the lacking independent board member. See Issue 129 for more detail. The Economy Ministry expects that by Nov. 7, the executive search consultant will have conducted a preliminary assessment of the documents, interviewed the applicants, and submitted a list of potential candidates. The selection of all board members &#x2013; four independent and three state representatives &#x2013; is scheduled to be completed by Dec. 9. UMCC finally sold. On Oct. 9, the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) sold United Mining and Chemical Company (UMCC) for Hr 3.94 billion ($95 million), just Hr 39 million ($948,000) more than the starting price of Hr 3.9 billion ($94.8 million). On Oct. 11, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the results of the auction. The sale of UMCC was the country&#x2019;s second online auction for a large-scale privatization asset in the Prozorro.Sale system, the SPFU said. The first one was Kyiv&#x2019;s four-star Ukraine Hotel, which was sold for Hr 2.5 billion ($60 million). See Issue 148 for more detail. According to the SPFU and Prozorro.Sale, the only bidder, and, accordingly, the winner, is Cemin Ukraine LLC, owned by Azerbaijani businessman Nasib Hasanov. Hasanov is the owner of the Azerbaijani NEQSOL Holding, which is known in Ukraine for being the owner of the telecom company Vodafone Ukraine. In Azerbaijan, NEQSOL also owns the telecom operator Bakcell. Besides, NEQSOL has extensive experience in the mining business. Its subsidiary, Nobel Oil E&amp;P, is engaged in exploration and production, while Nobel Energy provides services to oil and gas operators. NEQSOL&#x2019;s oil and gas production business is concentrated in Azerbaijan, the U.S., and the U.K. According to the privatization terms, the winner must maintain UMCC&#x2019;s core business and invest at least Hr 400 million ($9.7 million) in technical re-equipment and modernization. In addition, it must pay off overdue accounts payable (Hr 609 million or $14.8 million) and wage and budget arrears, if any, at the time of transfer of ownership, the SPFU explained. Also, 20% VAT is added to the purchase price, bringing the total value of the lot to nearly Hr 5 billion ($121 million), Oleksiy Movchan, deputy chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Economic Development, noted. &#x201C;NEQSOL aims to implement its plans to modernize, develop new products through deep processing of raw materials and expand into global markets alongside fulfilling all privatization obligations,&#x201D; NEQSOL Holding&#x2019;s Country Director Volodymyr Lavrenchuk said. UMCC is Ukraine&#x2019;s largest titanium ore concentrate mining and processing company. It comprises Vilnohirsk Mining and Metallurgical Plant in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and the Irshansk Plant in Zhytomyr Oblast. In October 2023, UMCC resumed shipments of ilmenite concentrate to the European market (see Issue 106 for more detail). The company&#x2019;s net profit for the first half of 2024 was over Hr 61.6 million (1.4 million euros at the average exchange rate over that period). This was not the first attempt to sell UMCC. As we wrote in Issue 33 three years ago, the UMCC privatization auction was scheduled to take place on Aug. 31, 2021. Later, in SOE Weekly&#x2019;s Issue 41, we reported that the SPFU cancelled that auction because it only had one qualified bidder. The media published a list of participants allegedly interested in UMCC assets. Some of them said that the asset was not well prepared for privatization, and they did not consider the auction terms fair. Others claimed that the starting price was inadequate. It was reportedly impossible to estimate the company&#x2019;s mineral deposits. The SPFU&#x2019;s auction commission set Oct. 29, 2021 as the new auction date, but that auction was also cancelled (see Issue 49 for more). So was the following auction on Dec. 20, 2021 (see Issue 57 for more detail). See more on the previous attempts to sell UMCC in our Issues 33, 41, 49, 56, and 57. In Issue 105, we reported that the SPFU changed UMCC&#x2019;s executive board, dismissing first deputy CEO Yaroslava Maksymenko and replacing her with Yegor Perelygin in September 2023. As we wrote in Issue 135, the Cabinet appointed Perelygin as UMCC&#x2019;s acting CEO on June 4. As we reported in Issue 106, the SPFU planned for UMCC to be one of the first large companies to be privatized. The starting price would be determined with BDO Corporate Finance, the SPFU&#x2019;s advisor on the privatisation of UMCC. However, as we wrote in Issue 109, then acting head of the SPFU Oleksandr Fedoryshyn said later in October 2023 that the SPFU was going to offer investors to buy UMCC in a single package with Demurinsky Mining and Processing Plant. Vitaliy Koval, the newly appointed head of the SPFU, confirmed this later in an interview in January (see our Issue 117). In effect, this suggested that the SPFU&#x2019;s previously announced plans to privatize UMCC as one of the first targets would be seriously delayed, if not put aside. However, the SPFU&#x2019;s communication on the matter in May suggested that the Fund discarded the idea of bundling UMCC and Demurinsky in a single lot. The SPFU auction commission determined the terms of UMCC&#x2019;s privatisation on May 23, setting the starting price at Hr 3.9 billion (90 million euros at that time). See Issue 133 for more detail. As we wrote in Issue 150, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) completed the pre-trial investigation into the Dmytro Sennychenko case, alleging the SPFU&#x2019;s former head and his accomplices of embezzling millions from state-owned enterprises, including Odesa Portside Plant (OPZ) and UMCC in 2019-2021. See our Issues 80, 83, 114, 131, and 150 for detail. Cabinet puts seized VSMPO Titan Ukraine on privatization list. On Oct. 8, the Cabinet of Ministers added one more seized Russian company to the large-scale privatization list &#x2014; the Nikopol plant of seamless titanium alloy pipes, or VSMPO Titan Ukraine. The SPFU said that value of the company&#x2019;s assets as of Dec. 31, 2023 was Hr 271.7 million ($6.6 million). The auction commission will set the starting price and terms of sale and submit them to the Cabinet for approval. After that, the date of the privatization auction will be announced, the SPFU added. As we wrote almost two years ago (Issue 72), the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) seized a part of Russian oligarch Mikhail Shelkov&#x2019;s Ukrainian assets, including VSMPO Titan Ukraine, in January 2023. On Feb. 3, 2023, the HACC seized Shelkov&#x2019;s another key asset, the Demurinsky Mining and Processing Plant (see Issue 74). Shortly after that, the Cabinet transferred Shelkov&#x2019;s assets to the SPFU, including Demurinsky (see Issue 77). In October 2023, then acting head of the SPFU Oleksandr Fedoryshyn said that the SPFU intended to offer investors to buy Demurinsky as a single package with UMCC (see Issue 109). Vitaliy Koval, the newly appointed head of the SPFU, confirmed this later in an interview in January (see our Issue 117). In effect, this suggested that the SPFU&#x2019;s previously announced plans to privatize UMCC as one of the first targets would be seriously delayed, if not put aside. However, the SPFU&#x2019;s communication on the matter in May suggested that the Fund discarded the idea of bundling UMCC and Demurinsky in a single lot (see Issue 133). As we wrote in Issue 140, on July 9, the Cabinet added Demurinsky to the large privatization list.

Russian electronics plant reportedly on fire after drone strike in Bryansk	The &quot;Kremniy El&quot; microelectronics plant caught fire in the Russian city of Bryansk following a Ukrainian drone strike overnight on Oct. 19, Russian and Ukrainian media reported. &quot;Kremniy EL&quot; is one of the largest microelectronics plants in Russia that produces components widely used in Russian defense production, including for Pantsir air defense systems and Iskander missile systems. The plant is located over 100 kilometers (about 62 miles) north of the border with Ukraine&apos;s northern Sumy Oblast. It was attacked at least once before, in August 2023. The Russian Defense Ministry said its air defense had downed 13 Ukrainian drones over Bryansk Oblast, six over Belgorod Oblast, two over Rostov Oblast, and one over Belgorod Oblast overnight. Later in the morning, the ministry reported four more drones downed over Bryansk Oblast by the Russian air defense. Russian media published videos shot by local residents of at least one explosion and smoke plumes rising over the factory. Bryansk Oblast Governor Alexander Bogomaz reported the fire in a &quot;non-residential building&quot; following the Ukrainian attack, claiming that it was put out by the Russian emergency workers. He reported no casualties. Later in the morning, Bogomaz claimed another &quot;non-residential building&quot; was hit in the second attack of Ukrainian drones on Oct. 19, causing no casualties. He said emergency responders were working at the scene. Ukrainian authorities had not commented on the attacks at the time of the publication. Ukrainian forces regularly conduct drone strikes and sabotage acts on Russian territory, targeting military assets, oil refineries, and industrial facilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-electronics-plant-reportedly-on-fire-after-drone-strike-in-bryansk/	2024-10-19T01:54:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/------.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 677,180 troops since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 675,800 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 18. This number includes 1,380 casualties Russian forces suffered over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,035 tanks, 18,072 armored fighting vehicles, 26,946 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,548 artillery systems, 1,232 multiple launch rocket systems, 978 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 17,230 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-677-180-troops-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-19T00:17:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2123611407.jpg
Released activist Butkevych says prisoner swap was complete surprise	Ukrainian journalist and human rights activist Maksym Butkevych said he did not know he was going to be released in a prisoner swap until he was already in transit. Russia and Ukraine on Oct. 18 conducted their 58th prisoner exchange, involving 190 detainees, including Butkevych. The activist was serving a 13-year sentence in a Russian penal colony at the time of his release. The exchange came without warning, Butkevych told the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske. &quot;No, I didn&apos;t know, it was unexpected,&quot; he said. &quot;Yesterday morning, after the inspection, they told me that I was leaving in half an hour, but they didn&apos;t tell me where. Accordingly, I packed my things because I thought I was being transported, not for an exchange. We found out about the exchange by accident on the way. It was a double surprise.&quot; Butkevych was one of 95 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) returned on Oct. 18. The list also included 34 members of the Azov Regiment, who defended the southern city of Mariupol in the early months of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Before the war, Butkevych worked with a Ukrainian NGO supporting internally displaced persons and with the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Ukraine. He enlisted in the Ukrainian military following the Feb. 2022 invasion. After being captured in the summer of 2022, a Russian-appointed court forced him to plead guilty to allegedly firing a grenade launcher at an apartment building. Russian-appointed authorities in occupied Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts sentenced Butkevych to 13 years in prison in March 2023, in what Amnesty International deemed &quot;a grave miscarriage of justice.&quot; Following his arrest, Butkevych&apos;s whereabouts were unknown for long periods of time until it was revealed that he was being held in a penal colony in Krasnyi Luch in Russian-occupied Luhansk Oblast. Butkevych said his release proves that it is possible to free more imprisoned Ukrainians. &quot;I hope this will give hope to others,&quot; he said. &quot;I was released together with a colleague from a colony where more than 40 convicted prisoners of war are held on trumped-up cases. It is very important for them to know that this is possible and that the exchange is taking place.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/released-activist-butkevych-says-prisoner-swap-was-complete-surprise/	2024-10-18T20:55:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/_125913478_2205a6ea-ff42-438d-adf7-c6b9ed1638d0.jpeg
Kursk Oblast conscripts among Russians returned in POW exchange, Russian org says	Many of the 95 Russian prisoners of war (POWs) exchanged in the latest Moscow-Kyiv prisoner swap were conscripts captured in Kursk Oblast, the Russian organization &quot;Our Way Out&quot; reported. Ukraine and Russia on Oct. 18 conducted their 58th prisoner exchange, with each side swapping 95 detainees. Prisoners returned to Ukraine include human rights activist Maksym Butkevych and 34 soldiers of the Azov Regiment. The returned Russian prisoners were mostly conscripts, many of whom were captured in Kursk Oblast, according to &quot;Our Way Out,&quot; an organization founded by Russian women to help families of POWs locate their relatives in Ukraine. The returned prisoners also reportedly included some mobilized Russian fighters and contract soldiers, including kadyrovtsy, the notoriously ruthless troops named for Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov. Ukrainian forces have controlled some parts of Kursk Oblast since launching a surprise cross-border incursion in early August. Along with occupying about 1,200 square kilometers of Russian territory, Ukrainian troops captured hundreds of Russian soldiers in the region. Many of those captured in the Kursk incursion were conscripts, young men undergoing their mandatory 12 months of military service who never expected to see combat. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 6 that the Kursk incursion has proven one of the most significant contributions to Ukraine&apos;s prisoner exchange fund. The United Arab Emirates reportedly assisted in brokering the latest prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia, which involved 190 prisoners. Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets on Oct. 18 confirmed that 3,767 Ukrainian POWs have returned home since the start of the full-scale war. According to &quot;Our Way Out,&quot; 71 of the 95 returned Russians were located by relatives with the assistance of Ukraine&apos;s &quot;I Want to Find&quot; project, which has helped locate over 500 missing Russian soldiers. Ukraine&apos;s POW Coordination Headquarters launched the project in January as a sign of Ukraine&apos;s commitment to the principles of international humanitarian law.	https://kyivindependent.com/kursk-oblast-conscripts-among-russians-returned-in-pow-exchange-russian-org-says/	2024-10-18T19:17:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166353982.jpg
Russian troops have not gained foothold across canal in Chasiv Yar, military says	Russian forces have not &quot;managed to gain a foothold&quot; across the Siverskyi Donets-Donbas canal in the embattled city of Chasiv Yar, Anastasia Bobovnikova, a spokesperson of the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 18. Bobovnikova&apos;s comments came after the crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState reported on Oct. 17 that Russian forces had advanced in Chasiv Yar. &quot;I do not confirm the fact that Russian troops have managed to gain a foothold in the canal ... or anywhere in the direction of Chasiv Yar,&quot; Bobovnikova said. &quot;The overall strategic position of the city remains under the control of Ukraine.&quot; Groups of Russian soldiers have, at times, crossed the canal and engaged in assault operations on the Ukrainian-controlled side of the city, Bobovnikova clarified. &quot;Given that the enemy uses the tactics of small assault groups, the enemy infantry runs behind the canal,&quot; Bobovnikova said. &quot;However, such maneuvers are accompanied by significant losses for the Russians. Ukrainian forces quickly repel such attacks, pushing Russian units back.&quot; According to Bobovnikova, small groups of Russian soldiers have &quot;occupied&quot; buildings on the western side of the canal, but they are quickly flushed out by Ukrainian units. The Donetsk Oblast city of Chasiv Yar has been partially under Russian control since Ukrainian forces withdrew from the eastern Kanal neighborhood in July, establishing the canal as the new front line. Russian troops set their sights on Chasiv Yar, which boasts natural elevation, after capturing Avdiivka in February. If Russian forces occupy the city completely, the higher ground could give them a key strategic advantage in attacks on other towns in Donetsk Oblast. Before the full-scale invasion, Chasiv Yar was home to about 12,000 people. By April 2024, around 700 people remained. In recent months, Russian troops have been conducting a grinding advance in eastern Ukraine, making territorial gains while incurring heavy losses.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-have-not-advanced-across-canal-in-chasiv-yar-military-says/	2024-10-18T18:09:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2159884804.jpg
US offers $10 million reward for information on Russian media organization accused of election interference	The United States is providing a reward of up to $10 million for information that helps prevent or disrupts foreign election interference linked to the Russian state-sponsored Rybar media organization, the U.S. State Department announced. Rybar and its employees are accused of using social media to meddle in the upcoming U.S. presidential election. The established bounty comes as the U.S. continues to crackdown on supposed Russian election interference. On Sept. 4, amid the presidential election campaign period, the U.S. announced sanctions against high-profile Russian propagandists like Margarita Simonyan and seized 32 internet domains linked to Kremlin propaganda campaigns. Rybar LLC, founded by the now deceased founder of Wagner PMC, Yevgeny Prigozhin, is a state-funded Russian media organization that is contracted by Russian state-owned arms manufacturer Rostec, according to the State Department&apos;s Rewards for Justice program. Rybar&apos;s employees manage multiple social media channels synonymous with conservative movements in the United States, including the #HOLDTHELINE and #STANDWTHTEXAS social media channels. Ahead of the 2024 presidential election, Ryabr created the &quot;TEXASvsUSA&quot; channel on social media platform X, intended to &quot;exploit the issue of undocumented immigrants crossing the Texas border,&quot; the State Department said. Through the use of its latest social media channel, the State Department alleges that Rybar seeks &quot;to sow discord, promote social division, stoke partisan and racial discord, and encourage hate and violence in the United States.&quot; Rybar and its employees are included among a list of 8 individuals or entities that the State Department lists as having rewards associated with their capture. Russia has been accused of using social media disinformation, bot farms, and other means to back Donald Trump against his Democratic opponents &#x2013; Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden &#x2013; during the 2016 and 2020 elections. Trump is running for president a third time, and will face off against Vice President Kamala Harris in November. U.S. intelligence officials said they &quot;have not observed a shift in Russia&apos;s preferences for the presidential race from past elections.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/us-offers-10-million-reward-for-information-on-russian-media-organization-accused-of-election-interference/	2024-10-18T16:12:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2051572830.jpg
Human rights activist Maksym Butkevych among those returned in 190-person prisoner swap	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Ukrainian human rights activist and serviceman, Maksym Butkevych, was among the 95 prisoners of war who were returned to Ukraine on Oct. 18, Butkevych&apos;s family confirmed. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry announced on Oct. 18 that it had conducted a 95-for-95 prisoner exchange with Ukraine. Ukrainian officials have not yet commented on the reported swap. No details were immediately available as to other POWs returned home to Ukraine. Nor was it immediately clear as which prisoners held by Ukraine were returned to Russia. The United Arab Emirates reportedly assisted in brokering the 190-person prisoner exchange. Human Rights Center ZMINA, the organization which Butkevych co-founded, announced Butkevych return from Russian captivity, where he has held since being captured in June 2022. Butkevych is a well-known human rights activist and journalist specializing in the protection of refugees. Before the war, Butkevych worked with a Ukrainian NGO supporting internally displaced persons, as well as at the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Ukraine. He decided to enlist in the Ukrainian military after the full-scale invasion. After being captured in the summer of 2022, a Russian-appointed court forced him to plead guilty to allegedly firing a grenade launcher at an apartment building. Russian-appointed authorities in occupied Luhansk and Donetsk sentenced Butkevych to 13 years in prison in March 2023, in what Amnesty International deemed as &quot;a grave miscarriage of justice.&quot; Following his arrest, Butkevych&apos;s whereabouts were unknown for long periods of time until it was revealed that he was being held in a penal colony in Krasnyi Luch in Russian-occupied Luhansk Oblast. According to ZMINA, Butkevych is currently back on Ukrainian territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/human-rights-activist-maksym-butkevych-among-those-returned-in-95-person-prisoner-swap/	2024-10-18T13:38:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/_125913478_2205a6ea-ff42-438d-adf7-c6b9ed1638d0.jpeg
Western leaders discuss Ukraine's victory plan, providing additional assistance at high-level talks in Germany, White House says	The leaders of the United States, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom discussed Ukraine&apos;s five-point victory plan as well as plans to provide additional military and humanitarian assistance on Oct. 18 during high-level talks in Berlin, a readout by the White House said. The discussions on the victory plan comes just days after President Volodymyr Zelensky publicly unveiled the details of the plan, the with exception of three secret addenda that have been shared with international partners. No details were provided in the readout as to what specific additional assistance is in store for Ukraine, or on the outcome of their discussions on the victory plan. One of the key tenets of Ukraine&apos;s victory plan is an unconditional invitation for Ukraine to join NATO. While Western leaders have repeatedly said that Ukraine will become a member of the alliance at some point, a specific timetable for its accession has not been publicly clarified. Since the victory plan&apos;s unveiling to Western leaders, the plan has reportedly received a mixed reception from allies. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Oct. 2 that the plan and identified &quot;a number of productive steps&quot; for progress. Ahead of the high-level meeting, U.S. President Joe Biden urged a continuation of Western support for Ukraine. &quot;We cannot let up. We must sustain our support. In my view, we must keep going until Ukraine wins a just and durable peace consistent with the U.N. Charter,&quot; Biden said. The West must &quot;ensure that Ukraine prevails and (Russian President Vladimir) Putin fails and NATO remains strong and more united than ever,&quot; Biden added. Biden first held bilateral talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier before a wider meeting with other leaders.	https://kyivindependent.com/western-leaders-discuss-ukraines-victory-plan-providing-additional-assistance-at-high-level-talks-in-germany-white-house-says/	2024-10-18T12:45:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178355670.jpg
Ukraine war latest: 11,000 North Korean troops will be 'ready to fight' in Ukraine by Nov. 1, Budanov says	Key developments on Oct. 18: Close to 11,000 North Korean troops are in Russia and will be &quot;ready to fight&quot; in Ukraine by Nov. 1, Ukrainian military intelligence head Kyrylo Budanov said in comments published by the War Zone on Oct. 17. Budanov said the first group of 2,600 soldiers will be deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. The troops will be using Russian equipment and ammunition, but further information is currently unknown. &quot;We don&apos;t have the full picture right now,&quot; Budanov said. Concerns about North Korea&apos;s direct involvement in Russia&apos;s full-scale war have reached a fever pitch in recent days. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels on Oct. 17, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia is planning to train and engage not only infantry but also North Korean specialists in various branches of the military. &quot;We know about 10,000 soldiers from North Korea they are preparing to send to fight against us,&quot; he added. The Kyiv Independent contacted the President&apos;s Office to ask about the discrepancy between Budanov&apos;s and Zelensky&apos;s figures, but had not received a response at the time of publication. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) said on Oct. 18 that Pyongyang had recently decided to deploy 12,000 North Korean soldiers, including special forces, to support Russia&apos;s war effort. The NIS did not say if the troops had already been sent into the field or where they might be deployed. At the same time, Pentagon spokesperson Pat Ryder said on Oct. 17 that he &quot;can&apos;t confirm whether there are North Korean forces that have gone to Russia&quot; but added that the U.S. would &quot;continue to monitor&quot; the situation. If the reports were true, it would &quot;demonstrate the situation that Russia finds itself in, the dire situation that it finds itself in, in terms of its forces on the battlefield.&quot; &quot;And so it just demonstrates the desperation in terms of identifying additional forces for their military,&quot; Ryder added. Ukrainian forces have liberated and &quot;cleared out&quot; the village of Kruhliakivka in Kharkiv Oblast of Russian soldiers, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Oct. 18. The operation was carried out from Oct. 7-14 by special forces of the Bratstvo unit with the support of Ukraine&apos;s 77th Separate Airmobile Brigade. &quot;As a result of the operation, the enemy was driven out of the settlement, and the occupiers&apos; routes of movement were mined,&quot; the agency said. HUR described Kruhliakivka as important for the defense of Kupiansk, a crucial strategic town in Kharkiv Oblast, located just 40 kilometers from the Russian border.Recaptured by Ukraine in 2022, Kupiansk faced mounting pressure from Russian forces over the past months following Moscow&apos;s renewed Kharkiv offensive. Russian troops carried out 19 attacks in the sector over the past day, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said. According to HUR, Russia lost more than a platoon of infantry (usually from 15 to 45 soldiers) during the recent operation. Ukrainian forces also reportedly took over Russian captives, having received &quot;important intelligence data.&quot; &quot;The enemy resisted, tried to counterattack, but was defeated. Intelligence soldiers repelled the occupiers&apos; assault and continued to push the enemy out,&quot; the agency added. U.S. President Joe Biden urged a continuation of Western support for Ukraine in Berlin on Oct. 18. The president had arrived earlier in the day for high-level talks with the leaders of Germany, the U.K., and France on Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. &quot;We cannot let up. We must sustain our support. In my view, we must keep going until Ukraine wins a just and durable peace consistent with the U.N. Charter,&quot; Biden said. The West must &quot;ensure that Ukraine prevails and (Russian President Vladimir) Putin fails and NATO remains strong and more united than ever.&quot; Biden had previously canceled foreign trips to oversee recovery efforts after a series of devastating hurricanes hit the east coast of the U.S. &quot;Ready to greet old friends and strengthen our close alliance as we stand together for freedom and against tyranny around the world,&quot; Biden wrote on X, sharing a picture of his arrival in Berlin. Biden will first hold bilateral talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier before a wider meeting with other leaders. &quot;The situation on the battlefield in Ukraine, the trajectory of the war, how allies can best support Ukraine will be a subject of conversation,&quot; a senior U.S. official said ahead of Biden&apos;s trip. In a speech outside the presidential palace, Steinmeier thanked Biden for his role in helping stabilize the U.S.&apos;s role in NATO. &quot;When you were elected president, you restored Europe&#x2019;s hope in the transatlantic alliance literally overnight.&quot; Germany and the Netherlands detailed new packages of military assistance on Oct. 17 that have either already been delivered to Ukraine or are on their way soon. The Netherlands said it had ordered six self-propelled DITA howitzers from the Czech Republic to be sent to Ukraine, as well as an undisclosed number of 152mm artillery shells. Germany said it had handed over a new package of military equipment, which included eight Leopard 1 A5 main battle tanks, 20 Marder infantry fighting vehicles, four mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles (MRAP), one IRIS-T SLM air defense system, one IRIS-T SLS air defense system, six Panzerhaubitze 2000 self-propelled howitzers, as well as reconnaissance drones, demining equipment, and tens of thousands of rounds of artillery shells and other ammunition. The Danish Defense Ministry also announced a new 2.4 billion kroner ($350 million) military aid package for Ukraine on Oct. 18. The package includes weapons from Denmark&apos;s stockpiles, funding for air defense systems with Germany, and contributions to the UK-led International Fund for Ukraine (IFU), according to the statement. Part of the funds will be used to expand training programs for the Ukrainian military. &quot;The government is working to make a decision on further procurement directly from the Ukrainian defense industry, including in the area of drones,&quot; Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said. Ukraine is improving its interceptor drones as a substitute for anti-aircraft missiles to counter Russian drone attacks, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Oct. 18. Syrskyi met with top commanders of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces to discuss implementing innovations in the country&apos;s defense sector. He described Ukraine as the leader in the development of interceptor drones. Throughout Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing modern warfare. Multiple videos have shown how Ukrainian first-person view (FPV) drones hit Russian reconnaissance drones and other costly equipment on the battlefield. &quot;My sincere gratitude goes to everyone who implements relevant solutions, assists, trains, and produces drones that intercept enemy UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles),&quot; the general added. According to Syrskyi, the air command authorities have also begun to introduce automation systems that can help destroy Russian aerial targets more effectively. He outlines the protection of critical infrastructure by air defenses as one of the key tasks ahead of winter, as Ukrainian officials warn that Russia may resume strikes on Ukraine&apos;s energy sector in the coming months. &quot;We continue to equip the Air Force with modern electronic warfare systems,&quot; Syrsyi said. &quot;This will increase the reliability of protection of facilities that are protected from air strikes.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-37/	2024-10-18T12:03:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029632286.jpg

Western-made parts found in North Korean missile downed over Ukraine, report shows	The North Korean KN-23/24 missile launched by Russia at Ukraine in September contained components made by at least nine Western manufacturers, Ukraine&apos;s Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (NAKO) said in its report published on Oct. 17. Microelectronics made by companies from the U.S., Switzerland, the U.K., and the Netherlands were found in the North Korean missile that was shot down near the villages of Myrne and Bilyky in Poltava Oblast. Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened military cooperation as Russia seeks weapon supplies and other support in its full-scale war against Ukraine. North Korea has been supplying Russia with ballistic missiles and vast quantities of artillery shells. According to the analysis, some of the components found in the KN-23/24 missile were produced between 2021 and 2023. Most of the microelectronic components have the markings of American companies, including Analog Devices Inc. and Broadcom Inc., NAKO said. The non-governmental organization has reportedly examined over 2,500 components found in 30 pieces of Russian weapons and equipment since the start of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion. Some 2,000 aircraft components were supplied mainly by the West, NAKO said. Russia has been adapting to Western sanctions, using smuggling and various schemes to acquire the sanctioned goods. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Moscow plans to &quot;actually involve&quot; Pyongyang in the war against Ukraine in the coming months, with around 10,000 North Korean soldiers being prepared to join the Russian army.	https://kyivindependent.com/western-made-parts-found-in-north-korean-missile-downed-over-ukraine-report-shows/	2024-10-18T08:42:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1924859804.jpg

Ukraine retrieves bodies of 501 fallen soldiers	Ukraine has repatriated the bodies of 501 soldiers who died fighting against Russia, the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of the Prisoners of War reported on Oct. 18. The Geneva Conventions dictate that people who lost their lives during war are entitled to a dignified burial. Over 2,800 bodies and body fragments of fallen soldiers were identified by Ukraine as of early March, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said. According to the headquarters, the bodies of the 489 soldiers were retrieved from Donetsk Oblast, seven from Luhansk Oblast, and four from Zaporizhzhia Oblast. One more body was brought back from a morgue in Russia. &#x201C;After identification, the bodies of our defenders will be handed over to their families for a dignified burial,&#x201D; the headquarters wrote in a post on Telegram. The effort to retrieve the fallen soldiers was conducted in collaboration with several government and military agencies, including the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the Interior Ministry, the State Emergency Service, and the Armed Forces. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in late February that about 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed during the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-retrieves-bodies-of-501-fallen-soldiers/	2024-10-18T06:45:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161908116.jpg
Polish PM Tusk says Zelensky's victory plan will be reassessed after US election	Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Oct. 18 Ukraine&apos;s victory plan will be reassessed after the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Tusk said there is a lack of consensus among EU leaders regarding the plan, and it is difficult to tell how realistic it is because &quot;much depends on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.&quot; &quot;At the moment, we are waiting for the results of the U.S. election; no one is hiding it.&quot; Tusk emphasized that Poland&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership has not changed &#x2014; &quot;We stand in solidarity with Ukraine on this issue,&quot; he said. The U.S. presidential election, which will pit Republican nominee Donald Trump against Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris, will be held on Nov. 5. The election is widely thought to have a significant impact on the level of U.S. support for Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky presented the plan privately to Western leaders in September and made it public earlier in October. The proposal is comprised of five points: an invitation to join NATO, a defense aspect, non-nuclear deterrence of Russian aggression, economic growth and cooperation, and post-war security architecture. It also involves three classified addenda that have been shared with international partners. While Ukraine&apos;s Western allies have largely said that Ukraine will join NATO, a specific timeline on when that might happen has not been made public &#x2014; or agreed upon. Julianne Smith, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, said on Oct. 16 there is no immediate plan to invite Ukraine to join the alliance. Smith said, &quot;Ukraine is on an irreversible path to membership,&quot; but added, &quot;We are not at the stage where (NATO) is discussing issuing an invitation in the short term.&quot; Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz was less optimistic about the victory plan. In comments to the Polish Press Agency (PAP), Kosiniak-Kamysz said, &quot;Everyone would like the victory plan to be implemented in their hearts.&quot; &quot;But there is no great enthusiasm either &#x2014; as I hear &#x2014; in the European Council or in NATO headquarters because the situation on the front is difficult, there is enormous war fatigue.&quot; As a result, the victory plan &quot;is not a clear, bright light that will immediately change reality,&quot; Kosiniak-Kamysz added.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-pm-tusk-says-victory-plan-will-be-reassessed-after-us-election/	2024-10-18T05:56:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178154352.jpg
Russia suffers 2nd deadliest day since start of full-scale invasion, according to Ukraine's military	Russian forces on Oct. 17 suffered their second deadliest day since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to figures released by Kyiv. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported 1,530 Russian casualties over the past day, a figure only surpassed once in more than two-and-a-half years of fighting. The bloodiest day for Moscow&apos;s forces was on May 13, when they suffered a reported 1,740 casualties. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. Facing a shortage of manpower and a pressing need to maintain the grinding advances in eastern Ukraine, Russia has reportedly been throwing some of its most skilled troops into mass infantry attacks, and at very high costs. Russian casualty figures have surged in recent months. According to an analysis of the Ukrainian figures by analyst Ragnar Gudmundsson, two of the top ten bloodiest days for Moscow&apos;s forces since the launch of the full-scale invasion occurred this month &#x2014; 1,530 on Oct. 17, and 1,450 on Oct. 16. Three others all occurred last month &#x2013; Sept. 22, with 1,500 casualties, Sept. 28, with 1,470, and Sept. 21, with 1,440. &quot;The past four months have proved the costliest for Russian forces since the war began in 2022,&quot; according to a U.K. military intelligence report on Sept. 23. The report said Russian casualties, both killed and wounded, were averaging over 1,000 a day, and were 1,262 in May, 1,163 in June, 1,140 in July, and 1,187 in August, adding the total number since the start of the full-scale invasion was &quot;likely over 610,000.&quot; Steven Wolff, Professor of International Security at the University of Birmingham, told the Kyiv Independent last month that Russia&apos;s huge losses are indicative of a Russian military mindset that has not changed in decades. &quot;Russian military doctrine is Soviet-style, and it always relied on the depth of Russia and its enormous resources, including manpower resources,&quot; he said. &quot;The way in which (Soviet leader Joseph) Stalin just threw millions of people at the Nazis in the 1940s, it&apos;s not very different to what (Russian President Vladimir) Putin does in this terrible war of aggression against Ukraine.&quot; In order to sustain this pool of manpower, Putin earlier this month signed a decree increasing the total number of Russian military personnel and staff by 180,000, to just under 2.4 million.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-suffers-2nd-deadliest-day-since-start-of-full-scale-invasion-according-to-ukraines-military/	2024-10-18T05:09:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1248375324-1.jpg
Budanov says close to 11,000 North Korean troops in Russia, will be 'ready to fight' in Ukraine by Nov. 1	Close to 11,000 North Korean troops are in Russia and will be &quot;ready to fight&quot; in Ukraine by Nov. 1, military intelligence head Kyrylo Budanov said in comments published by the War Zone on Oct. 17. Budanov said the first group of 2,600 soldiers will be deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. The troops will be using Russian equipment and ammunition, but further information is currently unknown. &quot;We don&apos;t have the full picture right now,&quot; Budanov said. Concerns about North Korea&apos;s direct involvement in Russia&apos;s full-scale war have reached a fever pitch in recent days. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels on Oct. 17, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia is planning to train and engage not only infantry but also North Korean specialists in various branches of the military. &quot;We know about 10,000 soldiers from North Korea they are preparing to send to fight against us,&quot; he added. The Kyiv Independent contacted the President&apos;s Office to ask about the discrepancy between Budanov and Zelensky&apos;s figures, but had not received a response at the time of publication. Zelensky&apos;s statement came days after a Western diplomat told the Kyiv Independent that Pyongyang had sent 10,000 soldiers to Russia. According to military intelligence, some North Korean officers are already in the occupied territories of Ukraine and joined the Russian army. Their number is unknown, Zelensky added. He also said Moscow plans to &quot;actually involve&quot; North Korea in the war in the coming months. Estimates of North Korean troops involved in the war have continued to tick upwards. South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service (NIS) said on Oct. 18 Pyongyang had recently decided to deploy 12,000 North Korean soldiers, including special forces, to support Russia&apos;s war effort. The NIS did not say if the troops had already been sent into the field or where they might deployed. &#xA0; At the same time, Pentagon spokesperson Pat Ryder said on Oct. 17 he &quot;can&apos;t confirm whether there&apos;s North Korean forces that have gone to Russia&quot; but added that the U.S. would &quot;continue to monitor&quot; the situation. If the reports were true, it would &quot;demonstrate the situation that Russia finds itself in, the dire situation that it finds itself in, in terms of its forces on the battlefield.&quot; &quot;And so it just demonstrates the desperation in terms of identifying additional forces for their military,&quot; Ryder added.	https://kyivindependent.com/budanov-says-close-to-11-000-north-korean-troops-in-russia-ready-to-fight-in-ukraine/	2024-10-18T04:05:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157649988.jpg
Germany, Netherlands detail new military equipment being sent to Ukraine, including Leopard tanks, air defense systems	Germany and the Netherlands detailed new packages of military assistance on Oct. 17 that have either already been delivered to Ukraine or are on their way soon. The Netherlands said it had ordered six self-propelled DITA howitzers from the Czech Republic to be sent to Ukraine, as well as an undisclosed number of 152mm artillery shells. Germany said it had handed over a new package of military equipment, which included eight Leopard 1 A5 main battle tanks, 20 Marder infantry fighting vehicles, four mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles (MRAP), one IRIS-T SLM air defense system, one IRIS-T SLS air defense system, six Panzerhaubitze 2000 self-propelled howitzers, as well as reconnaissance drones, demining equipment, and tens of thousands of rounds of artillery shells and other ammunition. Initially a hesitant partner, Berlin became Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S., although German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is still reluctant to supply some key capabilities, namely Taurus long-range missiles. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW Kiel), which tracks international aid for Ukraine, Germany and the Netherlands have allocated 15 billion euros ($16.2 billion) and 6.4 billion euros ($6.9 billion), respectively.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-netherlands-detail-new-military-equipment-being-sent-to-ukraine/	2024-10-18T02:26:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169575198.jpg
North Korean troops preparing to help Russia's war in Ukraine a 'grave security threat,' says South Korea	North Korean troops being sent to Russia to assist its war in Ukraine is a &quot;grave security threat&quot; to the international community, South Korea&apos;s presidential office said on Oct. 18. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol convened an emergency meeting with key officials a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Pyongyang is preparing 10,000 soldiers of different branches and specializations to join Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion. &quot;The participants ... shared the view that the current situation where Russia and North Korea&apos;s closer ties have gone beyond the movement of military supplies to actual dispatch of troops is a grave security threat not only to our country but to the international community,&quot; South Korea&apos;s presidential office said in a statement after the meeting. &quot;They also decided not to stand by and will respond by mobilizing all available means in cooperation with the international community,&quot; it added. Up until now, Seoul has only provided humanitarian aid to Kyiv, though it has been reported the country has indirectly supplied artillery shells via the U.S. In June, South Korea said it would reconsider its policy of not directly supplying Ukraine with weapons after Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea dictator Kim Jong-Un signed a security agreement in Pyongyang. After the meeting on Oct. 18, South Korea&apos;s National Intelligence Service said it believes North Korea will deploy four brigades totalling 12,000 soldiers to the war in Ukraine, including special forces. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels on Oct. 17, Zelensky said that Russia is planning to train and engage not only infantry but also North Korean specialists in various branches of the military. &quot;We know about 10,000 soldiers from North Korea they are preparing to send to fight against us,&quot; he added. His statement came days after a Western diplomat told the Kyiv Independent that Pyongyang had sent 10,000 soldiers to Russia. Zelensky said that Moscow plans to &quot;actually involve&quot; North Korea in the war in the coming months. According to military intelligence, some North Korean officers are already in the occupied territories of Ukraine and joined the Russian army. Their number is unknown, Zelensky added. Zelensky said the participation of the North Korean military in Russia&apos;s war &quot;is the first step to a World War.&quot; Elsewhere, the White House said on Oct. 17 it &quot;can&#x2019;t confirm or corroborate&quot; whether North Korean troops had been dispatched to Russian in preparation of fighting in Ukraine. &quot;If true, that would demonstrate an increase in the cooperation between Russia and North Korea,&quot; U.S. Department of Defense Press Secretary Gen. Patrick Ryder said at a press briefing. Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened military cooperation as Russia seeks arms and other support in its full-scale war against Ukraine. North Korea has been supplying Russia with ballistic missiles and vast quantities of artillery shells.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-preparing-to-help-russias-war-in-ukraine-a-grave-security-threat-says-south-korea/	2024-10-18T02:14:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157615883.jpg
European Council says Russian assets should remain frozen until end of war, payment of reparations	The European Council said on Oct. 17 frozen Russian assets should &quot;remain immobilized&quot; until Moscow ends its full-scale war on Ukraine and makes reparations for damages caused to the country. Estimates of the damage that Russian aggression over the past decade has caused to Ukrainian infrastructure have varied. The World Bank said in February 2024 it could be as high as $486 billion. European countries hold roughly two-thirds of the $300 billion Russian sovereign assets immobilized after the outbreak of the full-scale war. While hesitant to confiscate the assets outright, the EU devised a plan to use windfall profits to fund Ukraine&apos;s reconstruction and defense needs. The European Council reiterated it would adhere to the &quot;security and defense policy&quot; of &quot;certain member states&quot; regarding the use of revenues generated from the frozen assets, and added it would continue to &quot;address all relevant legal and financial aspects.&quot; EU ambassadors agreed earlier in October on a plan to issue a 35-billion-euro ($37.2 billion) loan to support Ukraine&apos;s war-torn economy. The agreement followed Hungary&apos;s announcement it would block a key sanctions reform until after the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5. The deal is part of a broader G7 initiative to provide &#x20AC;45 billion ($50 billion) in aid to Kyiv, struggling to counter a renewed Russian offensive that has severely damaged its power infrastructure. Under the G7 plan, profits from Russia&apos;s frozen assets will gradually be used to repay the multi-billion-euro loan. EU officials said that the 35 billion loan will be &quot;undesignated&quot; and &quot;untargeted,&quot; allowing Ukraine maximum flexibility in how it spends the funds. The EU expects to start distributing the money early next year.	https://kyivindependent.com/european-council-says-russian-assets-should-remain-frozen-until-end-of-war-payment-of-reparations/	2024-10-18T01:35:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1497199866.jpg
Romania, Belarus scramble jets amid mass Russian drone attack on Ukraine	Ukraine&apos;s Air Force said on Oct. 18 it had shot down 80 out of 135 Russian drones launched at the country overnight. Amid the mass attack, Romania&apos;s Defense Ministry said it had scrambled jets as an unidentified aerial object approached, and then entered its territory before radar lost track of it near the town of Amzacea, some 200 kilometers (124 miles) south of the Ukrainian border. Both the Ukrainian Air Force and the Belarusian monitoring group Hajun said two drones had flown toward the Belarusian border. Hajun said Belarusian jets had been scrambled in response. The Air Force said beyond the 80 drones that were shot down across the country, another 44 were &quot;lost,&quot; possibly downed by means of electronic warfare. There were no reports of possible damage caused by falling debris or potential successful hits. It was not the first time that Romanian and Bulgarian jets have been scrambled amid Russian attacks on Ukraine. Debris from Russian missiles and drones have also been found in the territory of neighboring countries on numerous occasions.	https://kyivindependent.com/romania-belarus-scramble-jets-amid-mass-russian-drone-attack-on-ukraine/	2024-10-18T00:44:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1619864803.jpg
Biden arrives in Germany for high-level talks on Ukraine, Middle East	U.S. President Joe Biden arrived in Berlin on Oct. 18 for high-level talks with the leaders of Germany, the U.K., and France on Russia&apos;s full-scale war on Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. Biden had previously canceled foreign trips to oversee recovery efforts after a series of devastating hurricanes hit the east coast of the U.S. &quot;Ready to greet old friends and strengthen our close alliance as we stand together for freedom and against tyranny around the world,&quot; the president wrote on X. Biden will first hold bilateral talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier before a wider meeting with other leaders. &quot;The situation on the battlefield in Ukraine, the trajectory of the war, how allies can best support Ukraine will be a subject of conversation,&quot; a senior U.S. official said ahead of Biden&apos;s trip. There has been intense speculation &#x2014; as well as concern &#x2014; about how next month&apos;s presidential election could impact U.S. support for Ukraine. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has said he would &quot;get out&quot; of the war, while Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris has pledged to maintain U.S. assistance. Trump has often claimed he would end Russia&apos;s war within &quot;24 hours&quot; without elaborating on how he plans to achieve it. Some reports and statements from Trump&apos;s inner circle indicate this might entail pressuring Ukraine to cede territory or give up on its NATO aspirations. Ukraine and its Western allies have acknowledged the crucial role that the U.S. has played in supporting Kyiv as its largest provider of aid since the beginning of the full-scale war. On Oct. 16, Scholz emphasized to the German parliament that &quot;Germany and the U.S are the biggest supporters of Ukraine in defense of its sovereignty and integrity and its democracy. And we will continue to be so.&quot; &quot;But this is a time when, in addition to our clear support for Ukraine, we must also do everything we can to find out how we can ensure that this war does not go on forever, that it does not continue to kill an unbelievable amount of women and men.&quot; Discussions on Ukraine&apos;s victory plan, which President Volodymyr Zelensky shared behind closed doors with allies in recent weeks and made public on Oct. 16, are also expected. One of the key tenets of the plan is an unconditional invitation for Ukraine to join NATO. While Western leaders have repeatedly said that Ukraine will become a member of the alliance at some point, a specific timetable for its accession has not been publicly clarified. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-arrives-in-germany-for-high-level-talks-on-ukraine-middle-east/	2024-10-17T23:31:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GaIhKJXWwAAUra3.jpeg
General Staff: Russia has lost 675,800 troops since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 675,800 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 18. This number includes 1,530 casualties Russian forces suffered over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,027 tanks, 18,053 armored fighting vehicles, 26,908 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,533 artillery systems, 1,232 multiple launch rocket systems, 978 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 17,152 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-675-800-troops-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-17T22:24:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2163893481.jpg
Two Russian nationals face charges for distributing Wagner Group flyers in Krakow	The Krakow District Court has begun the trial of two Russian nationals, Andrei G. and Aleksei T., who were allegedly hired by the Wagner Group to distribute flyers in Krakow, Poland encouraging people to join the organization. They face charges related to foreign intelligence activities and involvement with an international armed group intending to commit acts of terrorism. Initially arrested by Poland&apos;s Internal Security Agency in August 2023, they could face up to 10 years in prison for their actions. Aside from Poland, they supposedly also worked in other cities in Europe including Berlin and Paris, also hanging flyers and distributing stickers with QR codes for enlistment. &quot;We received the Wagner Group flyers in Moscow. Our task was to distribute 3,000 flyers in Krakow and Warsaw, but we only managed to post 200. We were also told to take photos of them once they were up. I didn&#x2019;t want to be part of the propaganda; I was just looking to earn some money,&quot; one of the men stated in court. The Wagner Group played a pivotal role in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, leading Moscow&apos;s assault in the Battle of Bakhmut in the spring of 2023. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the then-leader of Wagner, died in a mysterious plane crash in Russia on Aug. 23, 2023. The crash came two months after Prigozhin led Wagner troops in a short-lived rebellion against the Kremlin. Following Prigozhin&apos;s mutiny and death, the mercenary group withdrew from Ukraine and became fragmented, operating in Belarus and some African nations friendly to Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/two-russian-nationals-face-charges-for-distributing-wagner-group-flyers-in-krakow/	2024-10-17T22:09:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1623017480.jpg
Ukraine urges international support in landmine clearance efforts at Swiss conference	At the annual Ukraine Mine Action Conference, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal urged the international community to increase support for demining efforts, during his address in Lausanne, Switzerland on Oct. 17. The conference, which is taking place from Oct. 17-18, aims to receive financial backing for demining projects from officials of over 50 countries in attendance. The estimated cost for demining is $34.6 billion, according to a World Bank study, and clearing these areas is crucial for restoring agricultural production and enabling millions of displaced Ukrainians to return. &quot;The scale of this challenge is truly massive,&quot; Shmyhal said, and highlighted the need for training 10,000 deminers and developing machines that can speed up the process. Mock-up scenarios are being shown to attendees to illustrate the risks posed by mines, and new demining technologies, such as AI-powered drones and remote-controlled machines, are being showcased. Ukraine also remains the world&#x2019;s most mined country. The country&apos;s Defense Ministry specialists have cleared 30,000 square kilometers of mines over the past two years - an area comparable to the size of Belgium or Moldova. 399 civilians have been killed and 915 have been injured by mines since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, according to U.N. monitors. Since 2022, approximately 174,000 square kilometers of Ukrainian land have been contaminated with explosives, making 144,000 square kilometers still potentially dangerous.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-urges-international-support-in-landmine-clearance-efforts-at-annual-swiss-conference/	2024-10-17T20:46:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1251947486.jpeg
Norway announces more than $270 million in aid for Ukraine's energy sector	Norway has increased its total support for Ukraine&#x2019;s energy sector to 3 billion kroner (around $274.2 million) as part of its broader aid plan, according to the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This includes 1.5 billion kroner ($117 million) newly allocated for preparing Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure for winter. &quot;We are working to provide more support in the energy sector and look forward to bringing more good news to our Ukrainian friends during the autumn and winter,&quot; Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said. Of the remaining amount, 1.1 billion kroner ($86 million) will be used for energy equipment purchases via the UN Development Program, 500 million kroner ($39 million) will go to the World Bank&apos;s Budget Support Facility, and 740 million kroner ($58 million) is designated for humanitarian aid to help Ukrainians prepare for the winter. This energy aid comes days after Norway&#x2019;s government announced an allocation of up to 967 million kroner (around $87.5 million) to enhance its defense industry, with a focus on supporting Ukraine. Norway is ranked 12th in the world in terms of the amount of aid provided to Ukraine, having so far provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian, financial, and military support, according to the Kiel Institute&apos;s Ukraine Support Tracker.	https://kyivindependent.com/norway-announces-more-than-270-million-in-aid-for-ukraines-energy-sector/	2024-10-17T19:22:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1636214818.jpg
Orban calls Zelensky's victory plan 'more than terrifying,' urges negotiations with Russia	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s victory plan &quot;more than terrifying&quot; in a social media post published Oct. 17. Zelensky presented his five-point victory plan to the European Council in Brussels on Oct. 17, one day after unveiling the plan to the public during a special session of Ukraine&apos;s parliament. &#xA0; &quot;What (Zelensky) outlined yesterday in the Ukrainian parliament is more than terrifying,&quot; Orban wrote on Facebook ahead of the EU summit. Orban urged the EU to change its strategy regarding the war in Ukraine and reiterated calls for &quot;a ceasefire and peace talks.&quot; Under Orban&apos;s leadership, Hungary has repeatedly blocked aid to Kyiv, pushed for negotiations with Moscow, and spouted Kremlin talking points. Since taking the presidency of the European Commission in July, Orban has lobbied aggressively to stand as a negotiator between Ukraine and Russia. Orban dismissed Zelensky&apos;s victory plan, which calls for more long-range weapons and the permission to use them against Russian targets, as &quot;dangerous.&quot; The proposal is comprised of five points: an invitation to join NATO, a defense aspect, non-nuclear deterrence of Russian aggression, economic growth and cooperation, and post-war security architecture. It also involves three classified addenda that have been shared with international partners. The EU must &quot;switch to a peace strategy instead of a war strategy,&quot; Orban said in his post, which also insisted that Ukraine was &quot;losing&quot; the war against Russia. &#xA0; &quot;I will also urge today that the German Chancellor and the French President start negotiations with Russia as soon as possible on behalf of the entire European Union, so that we can find a way out of this situation.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/orban-calls-zelenskys-victory-plan-terrifying-urges-negotiations-with-russia/	2024-10-17T16:29:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2159990634.jpg
Trump blames Zelensky, Biden for Russia's invasion of Ukraine	Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump blamed U.S. and Ukrainian leadership, rather than Russian President Vladimir Putin, for Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine during a podcast interview released on Oct. 17. The comments come three weeks ahead of the U.S. presidential election, a race which may determine the future of Washington&apos;s military support for Ukraine. U.S. President Joe Biden &quot;instigated the war,&quot; Trump told podcast host Patrick Bet-David, saying he &quot;largely blames&quot; Biden for the invasion. Trump also complained about President Volodymyr Zelensky and the amount of military aid Washington has provided to Kyiv. &quot;And that doesn&apos;t mean I don&apos;t want to help them because I feel very badly for those people. But (Zelensky) should never have let that war start,&quot; he said. &quot;That war&apos;s a loser.&quot; Trump claimed Russia would not have launched the full-scale invasion in February 2022 if he had been president at the time. &quot;This should&apos;ve been settled before it started,&quot; he said. &quot;It would&apos;ve been so easy. If we had a president with half a brain, it would&apos;ve been easy to settle.&quot; Trump has made similar comments repeatedly during his campaign, insisting the war would not have happened on his watch while withholding concrete details on a plan to achieve peace now. While Trump was quick to blame Zelensky and Biden for the war, he made no mention of Putin during the interview. The omission is particularly glaring in light of recent claims that Trump held several secret phone conversations with Putin after leaving office in 2021. Trump has denied the allegations, leveled by journalist Bob Woodward in his new book &quot;War,&quot; calling them &quot;absolutely wrong.&quot; Despite these denials, Trump on Oct. 15 declined to confirm whether or not he had spoken to Putin after leaving the White House. &quot;If I did, it&apos;s a smart thing... If I&apos;m friendly with people, if I have a relationship with people, that&apos;s a good thing, not a bad thing, in terms of a country,&quot; he said. The U.S. in September launched a sweeping crackdown against Russian election interference, alleging that the Kremlin spearheaded a propaganda campaign to reduce support for Ukraine and influence the November vote in favor of Trump.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-blames-zelensky-biden-for-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/	2024-10-17T14:37:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173788651.jpg
Ukraine not developing nuclear weapons, Foreign Ministry says	Ukraine is not planning to develop weapons of mass destruction and remains committed to nuclear non-proliferation, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said in a statement issued Oct. 17. The statement came after the German media outlet Bild reported that Kyiv is preparing to develop nuclear weapons. The story cited an unnamed Ukrainian source. &quot;We officially refute the insinuations of unnamed sources in the Bild publication regarding Ukraine&apos;s alleged plans to develop weapons of mass destruction,&quot; Tykhyi&apos;s statement read. &quot;Ukraine has been and remains a committed party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)... having renounced the world&apos;s third-most powerful military nuclear capability. Ukraine, which has made the greatest contribution to international peace, security and nuclear non-proliferation in history, is now facing nuclear blackmail from the terrorist state of Russia.&quot; Earlier on Oct. 17, President Volodymyr Zelensky that he told Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in September that Ukraine must either join NATO or pursue nuclear capabilities for protection. Zelensky then clarified the comments, saying that Ukraine is not pursuing nuclear weapons and the remarks were made to emphasize the failures of the Budapest Memorandum. Under the 1994 agreement, referenced in the Foreign Ministry&apos;s statement, Ukraine agreed to give up its nuclear arsenal in exchange for receiving security guarantees from the U.S., the U.K., and Russia. &quot;Ukraine is convinced that the NPT remains the cornerstone of the global international security architecture,&quot; the ministry&apos;s statement said. &quot;Despite the ongoing Russian aggression, Ukraine continues to comply with the provisions of the NPT and remains a responsible participant in the international nuclear non-proliferation regime.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-not-developing-weapons-of-mass-destruction-foreign-ministry-says/	2024-10-17T13:36:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1983501762.jpg
US revising F-16 training to focus on younger pilots, WSJ reports	The United States is shifting the focus of its F-16 training program for Ukrainian pilots to prioritize younger trainees, potentially delaying the Ukrainian squadron&apos;s readiness to fight, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Oct. 17. The U.S. and other allies have been training Ukrainian pilots on F-16s at an acclerated pace due to Kyiv&apos;s urgent need for air defense against intensifying Russian bombardments. The shortened training came under scrutiny after an F-16 pilot was killed in a crash during a Russian attack in August. While the initial instruction program focused on experienced Ukrainian pilots, lack of requisite English-language abilities and difficulties adapting to Western-style training have prompted a shift to younger pilots, U.S. officials told the WSJ. &quot;It is a mix,&quot; a senior Pentagon official told the WSJ regarding the makeup of the Ukrainian trainees. &quot;Some have been experienced pilots, and we still are receiving more experienced pilots. But there&apos;s also those that do not have that kind of pilot training and experience.&quot; Those with experience flying Soviet-era fighter jets are able to skip basic flight training and take the accelerated course, while newer cadets must spend a year training as pilots before moving to the F-16 training bases in the U.S. and Romania. Shifting to younger pilots could thus extend the F-16 training program by months, delaying the Ukrainian squadron&apos;s battlefield readiness even further as Russian attacks continue to pummel the nation&apos;s energy grid and civilian neighborhoods. According to a person with knowledge of the F-16 program, even before the shift, Ukraine would not likely have a full squadron of F-16s until spring or summer of 2025 at the earliest. Only 11 F-16 pilots are currently flying in Ukraine, though&#xA0;a full squadron consists of 40. Ukraine received its first U.S.-made fourth-generation jets in late July, one year after Denmark, the Netherlands, and other foreign partners launched a fighter jet coalition for Kyiv.

Ukraine war latest: Zelensky says he told Trump that either Ukraine will join NATO or pursue nuclear weapons	Key developments on Oct. 17: President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 17 that he told Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in their meeting in September that Ukraine would either become a NATO member or pursue nuclear capabilities to protect itself. Zelensky was speaking from Brussels, where he presented his victory plan to EU leaders. &quot;Either Ukraine will have nuclear weapons, which will serve as protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance. Apart from NATO, we do not know of such an effective alliance,&quot; Zelensky said that he had told Trump. &quot;I believe Trump heard me and said that it was a fair argument,&quot; he added. Zelensky also invoked the Budapest Memorandum, in which Ukraine agreed in 1994 to give up its nuclear arsenal in exchange for security guarantees from Russia, the U.S., and the U.K. The agreement resulted in Ukraine losing its nuclear shield, Zelensky argued, while other powers that have maintained their nuclear arsenal have not suffered from a full-scale war. At the same time, Zelensky emphasized that he would choose NATO membership over pursuing nuclear weapons. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 17 that Ukraine was not pursuing nuclear weapons, clarifying comments he had made previously. Earlier in the day, Zelensky said that he told Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in their meeting in September that Ukraine needs to be part of NATO, or it would pursue nuclear capabilities to protect itself. In a press conference with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Zelensky walked back the comments and said explicitly that Ukraine was not seeking nuclear weapons. &quot;We never spoke about...that we are preparing to create nuclear weapons or something like this,&quot; he said. Zelensky chided the reporter for asking about the earlier comments and said they were made to describe how the Budapest Memorandum had failed to provide Ukraine with an effective security umbrella. Zelensky emphasized that, given the failure of the Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine has no other option for effective security besides joining NATO. &quot;But we don&apos;t do...nuclear weapons,&quot; he emphasized, adding that he would ask for such a narrative not to be propagated. Following Zelensky&apos;s comments, Rutte reiterated that Ukraine will become a NATO member but did not specify a timetable for when it would join. North Korea is preparing 10,000 soldiers of different branches and specializations to join Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 17. His statement came days after a Western diplomat told the Kyiv Independent that Pyongyang had sent 10,000 soldiers to Russia. Zelensky said that Moscow plans to &quot;actually involve&quot; North Korea in the war in the coming months. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels, the president said that Russia is planning to train and engage not only infantry but also North Korean specialists in various branches of the military. &quot;We know about 10,000 soldiers from North Korea they are preparing to send to fight against us,&quot; he added. According to military intelligence, some North Korean officers are already in occupied territories of Ukraine and joined the Russian army. Their number is unknown, Zelensky added. According to Zelensky, the participation of the North Korean military in Russia&apos;s war &quot;is the first step to a world war.&quot; Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened military cooperation as Russia seeks arms and other support in its full-scale war against Ukraine. North Korea has been supplying Russia with ballistic missiles and vast quantities of artillery shells. Iran is another Russian ally, aiding Moscow in its aggression against Ukraine. Tehran has provided Russia with thousands of Shahed kamikaze drones that are used for daily attacks across Ukraine. &quot;Iran gave (Russia) drones, license to produce these drones and missiles. But not people, not officially. And here we see this first step in this war,&quot; Zelensky added. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K., said it is almost impossible to escape the state of &quot;protracted&quot; war with Russia in a speech at the Chatham House on Oct. 17, according to a Kyiv Independent reporter. Zaluzhnyi reiterated that back in 2023, the West did not provide Kyiv with a sufficient number of weapons, which is why Ukraine failed to achieve &quot;significant success in defeating Russia&quot; during the counteroffensive. &quot;Consequentially, we ended up in a state of protracted war. In my personal opinion, a way out of this protracted war seems...almost impossible,&quot; he said. In November 2023, The Economist published an interview with Zaluzhnyi and an op-ed by the general, in which he characterized the state of the war as a &quot;stalemate.&quot; The comment contrasted the outlook usually offered by President Volodymyr Zelensky and his administration in public comments and reportedly triggered a discord between the two. Zaluzhnyi warned that Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine was moving to a &quot;positional&quot; stage. This new stage is characterized by &quot;static and attritional fighting&quot; that will allow Russia to restore its military power. Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in defending the front line, particularly in Donetsk Oblast, where Russia has consistently concentrated its offensive potential. Following Ukraine&apos;s withdrawal from Vuhledar in early October, Russian forces have been focusing their efforts against the Donetsk Oblast towns of Pokrovsk, Toretsk, and Kurakhove, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are slowly losing ground under Russian pressure. Nikita Klenkov, a deputy commander of a unit for Russia&apos;s military intelligence agency (GRU), was shot dead in Moscow Oblast by an unknown assailant, Russian media reported on Oct. 16. Klenkov, 44, was reportedly the deputy commander of GRU unit 43292, which serves as training center for Special Operations Forces, the Moscow Times reported. Russian Telegram channel Baza reported that Klenkov was shot at on the side of a road in the town of Melenki, east of Moscow. The assailant reportedly fire eight shots from the window of a car. According to the Russian state-run media outlet TASS, Klenkov &quot;returned home a week ago&quot; from Ukraine&apos;s front line, according to a GRU source. Russian state media reported that an investigation into the shooting is ongoing. The Kyiv Independent could not verify any of the reports in Russian state media. It is currently unclear if the attack was intended as a politically-motivated assassination. Kyiv has not commented on the situation. In July, another officer from Russia&apos;s GRU had his feet blown off in a car bomb attack in Moscow. Kyiv denied any involvement in that attack. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak told independent Russian media he believed there was &quot;a malfunction with the gas equipment in the car.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-36/	2024-10-17T12:20:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178873740.jpg
Ukraine signs bilateral security agreement with Greece	President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a bilateral security agreement with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Zelensky said on Oct. 17. Ukraine has already signed 25 similar agreements, including with the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and France, aimed at helping Kyiv repel Russia&apos;s aggression amid the full-scale war. These agreements are based on a pledge made by the Group of Seven (G7) in July 2022. &quot;Greece is ready to continue meeting Ukraine&apos;s most urgent defense needs,&quot; Zelensky wrote on X. &quot;(Greece) will also provide additional resources to accelerate F-16 training for our pilots and technicians,&quot; he added. Despite conflicting reports and pressure from the EU, Greece said in April 2024 that it would not send Ukraine either Patriots or S-300 air defense systems, despite these requests and Ukraine&apos;s critical air defense shortage. &quot;Greece supported Ukraine in various ways, with defense materials,&quot; Mitsotakis said at the time. &quot;But we said from the first moment that we cannot get rid of the weapons systems that are of crucial importance for our deterrence capabilities.&quot; Mitsotakis said that sending the equipment to Ukraine would pose too great of a risk to Greek air security. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW Kiel), which tracks international aid for Ukraine, Greece has allocated 137 million euros ($148 million) in assistance as of August 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-signs-bilateral-security-agreement-with-greece/	2024-10-17T07:19:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GaFxWqfXcAA2qaO.jpeg

Zelensky signs bill on customs reform into law	President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 17 signed a bill reforming the State Customs Service and introduced to tackle corruption and save funds otherwise lost to smuggling. After the presidential signature, the law will enter into force on Nov. 1. The legislation, approved by the parliament last month, was pushed through after prolonged pressure from Western partners and Ukrainian business associations. The reform is also a necessary step toward Kyiv&apos;s accession to the EU. Ukraine&apos;s Customs Service has been described as the &quot;biggest cash cow&quot; and the &quot;largest tax-evasion scheme in the country&quot; as smugglers avoid an estimated $2.4 to $3 billion in customs payments each year, the Kyiv Independent reported on Oct. 14. Ukrainians view the State Customs Service as the most corrupt institution in the country, with previous attempts at reforms falling flat. As one of the key changes under the bill, the new head of the service will be selected by an independent committee, half of which will consist of independent experts. The new chief will be able to choose his deputies. The legislation also includes audits by external experts, a one-time vetting of all the current employees, and greater independence from the Foreign Ministry. The law aims not only to reform the institution but also to bring more funds into state budget as Ukraine faces a deficit of $35 billion next year.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-signs-bill-on-customs-reform/	2024-10-17T06:12:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1242569002.jpg

NATO armies built on Korean War-era military principles, Zaluzhnyi says	The militaries of NATO member states continue to rely on security principles and weapons &quot;inherited from the Korean War&quot; that will not be relevant in modern warfare, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K., said on Oct. 17, according to a Kyiv Independent reporter. &quot;There will be no war of the 1953 model. I am talking about the Korean War. It ended in summer 2023 in Ukraine, when two professional armies of more than a million personnel each faced each other on the battlefield,&quot; the retired general said at Chatham House in London. When Zaluzhnyi was in charge of Ukraine&apos;s army in 2023, the Ukrainian military launched its counteroffensive aimed at pushing toward the Sea of Azov to cut Russia&apos;s land corridor to Crimea. Failing to reach its goals, it was limited to the liberation of a few villages in Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk oblasts, significantly slowed down by Russian minefields and a lack of air superiority and equipment. Since then, the near-complete saturation of the front line with drones and other unmanned system has continued to change how the war is fought. The ambassador also stressed that modern warfare brought new technologies to the battlefield, such as drones and artificial intelligence. Zaluzhnyi noted that it is impossible to produce expensive missiles, fighter jets, and aircraft carriers at the &quot;massive scale&quot; that modern warfare requires, meaning these systems will become less efficient. South Korea and the U.S. fought against North Korea and China in a bloody war in 1950-53, leading to a ceasefire and a division along the demarcation line that stands today. In the same speech, Zaluzhnyi said that it is almost impossible to escape the state of &quot;protracted&quot; war with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/global-security-wont-hold-on-korean-war-principles-in-future-zaluzhnyi-says/	2024-10-17T04:54:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2174412815.jpg
Ukraine's draft system burdened with Soviet heritage, fixing it will take time, Zaluzhnyi says	Ukraine had to change its approach to mobilization to remove Soviet influences, but more time is needed for a proper reform, Ukrainian ambassador to the U.K. Valerii Zaluzhyni said at an event on Oct. 17 in response to a Kyiv Independent reporter. &quot;Unfortunately, we don&apos;t have the luxury of time, so we have to resort to certain limitations. In a democratic society, all of this is perceived as very controversial,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief said in a speech at the Chatham House in London. Ukraine passed updated legislation on mobilization this spring in an effort to replenish its military ranks as the all-out war with Russia has been ongoing for over two and half years. Responding to a question from the Kyiv Independent on Ukrainian internal plans during Zaluzhyni&apos;s military tenure and their implementation, the ambassador acknowledged that Ukraine had made a number of mistakes dating back many years. &quot;As we change our country, mentality... &#xA0;(and we) order our country on a democratic basis, we had to change our approach to mobilization as well,&quot; Zaluzhyni noted. The retired general said that the mobilization system is still influenced by the Soviet heritage and &quot;actually dates as far back as the times of Peter the Great.&quot; &quot;We will be able to change that only when we have enough time... to bring up a whole generation which, without any interference from the state, will take up arms and go defend their home.&quot; In late 2023, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the military, then under Zaluzhnyi&apos;s command, requested drafting 450,000-500,000 people in the face of a prolonged war. Zaluzhyni later denied this figure. Uncertainties over mobilization and Zaluzhnyi&apos;s sobering statements for the media regarding the war contributed to the growing tensions between the two, with Zelensky eventually replacing the chief commander this February. In his speech, Zaluzhyni also warned that Russia will seek to misuse any possible tensions as it wages war in the &quot;informational and cognitive space,&quot; making the &quot;mobilization drive even more difficult.&quot; The accelerated mobilization push has contributed to social tensions within Ukraine, already aggravated by years of Russian attacks, energy deficits, and economic challenges.	https://kyivindependent.com/zaluzhnyi-on-mobilization/	2024-10-17T04:43:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2162421049.jpg
Getting out of 'protracted' war with Russia 'almost impossible,' Zaluzhnyi says	Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K., said it is almost impossible to escape the state of &quot;protracted&quot; war with Russia in a speech at the Chatham House on Oct. 17, according to a Kyiv Independent reporter.

Victory plan includes Western-supplied missile package to force Russia to talks, Zelensky says in Brussels	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 17 that the victory plan includes placing conventional missile capabilities in Ukraine that would either force Russia to accept negotiations or decimate Moscow&apos;s military targets. &quot;We propose placing on Ukrainian land a deterrence package that would either force Russia to participate in real negotiations or could allow the destruction of its military targets,&quot; Zelensky said when presenting the plan to the European Council in Brussels on Oct. 17. Ukraine&apos;s head of state arrived in Brussels a day after unveiling most of the five-point plan to the public in a speech in the Ukrainian parliament. The third point relates to a &quot;non-nuclear deterrence package&quot; positioned on Ukrainian territory. &quot;It&apos;s the peace-through-strength approach,&quot; Zelensky said, explaining this concerns a missile package obtained with the support of the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, and Italy. He did not specify what exact weapons systems Kyiv seeks in this context. Washington, London, and Paris have provided Ukraine with long-range missiles like ATACMS, Storm Shadow, and SCALP/T but did not permit their use within Russian territory. Lifting these restrictions was also one of the points included in the victory plan. &quot;(Russian President Vladimir) Putin should respect our strength, not have the free world tremble at his threats.&quot; According to the president, Ukraine would use the deterrence package only if Moscow did not give up on its war of aggression. During his address, Zelensky presented the victory plan&apos;s remaining four points, which concern an immediate invitation to NATO, defense support, economic cooperation, and post-war security architecture. The president called for sustained support from European partners &quot;because Putin is preparing his reinforcements to continue the war.&quot; &quot;Putin wants to match your country&apos;s ammunition production by next year,&quot; Zelensky said, adding that Moscow is receiving assistance from North Korea and Iran, among others. &quot;We are receiving signals that China is actively helping Russia drag out this war,&quot; the president said, citing &quot;clear intelligence data.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/victory-plan-deterrence/	2024-10-17T02:43:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177959215.jpg
Russian ships ineffective for missile strikes, used to distract Ukraine's defenses, Navy says	Russia is forced to use its warships to distract Ukraine&apos;s air defense during mass missile attacks as the vessels are not very effective in launching the strikes themselves, Dmytro Pletenchuk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Navy, said on Oct. 17. Russia has fired missiles against Ukraine from warships stationed in the Black and Azov seas. In recent weeks, Russia ramped up its attacks against port infrastructure and civilian vessels in southern Odesa Oblast, launching attacks from occupied Crimea. Speaking on national television, Pletenchuk said that when Russia deploys several cruise missile carriers to the sea, it does not mean they will be used for an attack. &quot;Because of the low effectiveness of these weapons systems, (Russia) was forced, at the moment, to use them more to distract air defenses during mass missile attacks,&quot; he said. According to the spokesperson, when one or two Russian submarines are at sea, they usually do not perform tasks related to missile launches but guard the base. Ukraine has repeatedly struck Russia&apos;s vessels since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Around 30% of Russia&#x2019;s Black Sea Fleet is lost or disabled, according to the Ukrainian military. Successful Ukrainian strikes on occupied Crimea forced Moscow to pull out much of its naval forces from the peninsula to the Russian city of Novorossiysk, which became a key port for the Russian Black Sea Fleet.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-warships-missile-strikes/	2024-10-17T01:58:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1564923593.webp
Zelensky arrives in Brussels to pitch Ukraine's victory plan to European Council	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Brussels on Oct. 17 to present his five-point victory plan to the European Council and meet its president, Charles Michel. &quot;All European leaders will hear how our positions must be strengthened. We must end this war fairly,&quot; Zelensky said in a video message from a plane on his way to Belgium. The Ukrainian president arrived in Brussels only a day after unveiling the plan to the public during a special session in Ukraine&apos;s parliament. He has previously pitched the plan to the U.S., U.K., German, French, and Italian leaders to drum up allied support before the uncertain U.S. election. The proposal is comprised of five points: an invitation to join NATO, a defense aspect, non-nuclear deterrence of Russian aggression, economic growth and cooperation, and post-war security architecture. It also involves three classified addenda that have been shared with international partners. After meeting EU leaders, Zelensky will meet top European Parliament officials and participate in a ministerial-level meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-arrives-in-brussels-to-pitch-victory-plan-to-european-council/	2024-10-17T01:43:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158896695.jpg

US, South Korea, Japan launch multinational group to monitor North Korea sanctions	The U.S., South Korea, and Japan launched a new multinational group to monitor the implementation of sanctions against North Korea, Reuters reported on Oct. 16. The move came after Russia and China blocked monitoring activities at the United Nations. In March, Moscow vetoed the annual renewal of the panel of experts monitoring U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Team (MSMT) is a multilateral mechanism to monitor and report violations and evasions of the sanction measures stipulated in the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions, the U.S. Department of State said. &quot;The goal of the new mechanism is to assist the full implementation of U.N. sanctions on (North Korea) by publishing information based on rigorous inquiry into sanctions violations and evasion attempts,&quot; the statement read. A number of nations said they are open to dialogue and called on other states to join in maintaining international security in the face of ongoing threats from North Korea. The U.N. Security Council adopted several sanctions against North Korea in 2006 to rein in its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, while the expert panel was created in 2009. Moscow&apos;s veto halts the work of the panel but does not cancel the sanctions themselves. Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened military cooperation as Russia seeks arms and other support in its full-scale war against Ukraine. North Korea has been supplying Russia with ballistic missiles and vast quantities of artillery shells. The two countries signed a mutual defense pact during Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s visit to Pyongyang earlier this year. President Volodymyr Zelensky recently accused Pyongyang of sending personnel to support Russia and said that Moscow plans to &quot;actually involve&quot; North Korea in the war in the coming months. A Western diplomat familiar with the matter told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15 that Pyongyang has sent 10,000 soldiers to Russia, but it is unclear in what capacity.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-south-korea-japan-to-monitor-north-korea-sanctions-under-new-multinational-group/	2024-10-17T00:37:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1139833730.jpg
German fighter jets scrambled due to Russian spy plane over Baltic Sea	Germany&apos;s Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft were scrambled due to a flight of a Russian Il-20 reconnaissance plane over the international waters of the Baltic Sea, the German Air Force said on Oct. 16. Such incidents are a common occurrence in the region, as Russia is suspected of using the aircraft to spy on the alliance&apos;s positions. The Russian aircraft, flying with switched-off communications and without a flight plan, reportedly ended up in an area between the German town of Rugen and the Danish town of Bornholm. In response, two Eurofighter jets took off from the Rostock-Laage airfield in northeastern Germany to &quot;establish a visual contact,&quot; Deutsche Welle reported. The German jets &quot;escorted the Russian reconnaissance aircraft over the Baltic Sea,&quot; the German Air Force said. Six other Russian aircraft were intercepted by NATO jets in a span of two days in late September. German and Swedish fighters were scrambled in August to intercept another Il-20 plane. Over the past two years, allied plans were reportedly lifted on average every three to four weeks to intercept Russian aircraft, Deutsche Welle wrote.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-jets-baltic-sea/	2024-10-17T00:27:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Il-Russia.jpeg
Russian attacks injure 9 in Donetsk, Kherson oblasts over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine injured nine people over the past day, regional authorities reported early on Oct. 17. Ukrainian air defenses downed 22 of the 65 attack drones launched overnight, the Air Force reported. Two drones flew in the direction of Belarus, and 27 were lost to electronic warfare means. Five drone strikes against infrastructure facilities were recorded in the front-line areas. Russia also reportedly attacked Ukraine with a Kh-95 guided aerial missile. Russia launched attack drones against Kyiv and the region in several weaves and from different directions. All the drones were shot down, with falling fragments damaging an apartment building in the capital and causing a fire at a farm in Kyiv Oblast, authorities said. No casualties were reported. Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast injured three people in the towns of Chasiv Yar and Pokrovsk and in the village of Mykolaivka, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian strikes injured six people, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Ten houses, five multi-story buildings, a car repair shop, and cars were damaged. An attack against Mykolaiv Oblast damaged an energy infrastructure facility, resulting in a blackout. No casualties were reported, Governor Vitalii Kim said. In Sumy Oblast, Russia attacked the Znob-Novhorodske community near the Russian border with drones, setting ablaze a two-story apartment building and a car. After first responders and medical workers arrived at the scene, Russia launched further drone strikes, damaging an ambulance and a fire truck. No casualties were reported. &#xA0; Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Poltava, Zhytomyr, Odesa, Ternopil, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts also came under attack, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-99/	2024-10-16T23:45:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1489471985.jpg
Loss of coal mine near Pokrovsk would reportedly halve Ukraine's steel production	Ukraine&apos;s steel production could drop by half if Russian troops capture a vital coal mine near the town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, Reuters reported on Oct. 16, citing Oleksandr Kalenkov, the head of Ukraine&apos;s steelmakers&apos; association. Pokrovske coal mine, the largest coking coal producer in Ukraine and one of the largest in Eastern Europe, is located 10 km (6 miles) west of Pokrovsk. The mine produces coal for coke production needed in steelmaking, which is Ukraine&apos;s second-largest source of currency after agriculture, Reuters reported. The eastern front near the town has been the scene of fierce fighting for several months and a focal point of Russia&apos;s offensive in Donetsk Oblast. Pokrovsk is an important logistical hub for Ukrainian forces. According to trade data, exports of steel products totaled nearly $2 billion in the first eight months of 2024. Kalenkov said that Ukrainian steelmakers could have produced up to 7.5 million metric tons of steel by the end of the year and planned to increase production to more than 10 million tons in 2025. &quot;But if we lose Pokrovsk, then... we will fall to 2-3 million tons,&quot; he added. In 2023, Ukraine produced about 3.5 million tons of coke, using coking coal from Pokrovsk alone, according to Anatolii Starovoit, the head of the Ukrkoks coke association. &quot;We don&apos;t know where to get coal if Pokrovsk is seized,&quot; he said. An unnamed steel industry source told Reuters that producers hope to find alternative sources of coking coal from elsewhere in Ukraine if Russia occupies the Pokrovsk mines. However, imports would inevitably be needed and increase production costs, making steel less competitive. Russian forces were less than 7 kilometers (4 miles) from the outskirts of Pokrovsk as of Oct. 4, said Serhii Dobriak, the head of Pokrovsk&apos;s military administration. As the evacuation was ongoing, around 13,000 people remained in the town.	https://kyivindependent.com/coal-mine-pokrovsk/	2024-10-16T23:23:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/---------------_----------.jpeg
General Staff: Russia has lost 674,270 troops since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 674,270 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 17. This number includes 1,420 casualties Russian forces suffered over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,014 tanks, 18,002 armored fighting vehicles, 26,815 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,510 artillery systems, 1,232 multiple launch rocket systems, 978 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 17,104 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-674-270-troops-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-16T22:14:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1249927309.jpg
High-ranking GRU officer shot dead in Moscow Oblast, Russian media reports	Nikita Klenkov, a deputy commander of a military unit for Russia&apos;s military intelligence agency (GRU), was shot dead in Moscow Oblast by an unknown assailant, Russian state-controlled media reported on Oct. 16. Klenkov, 44, was reportedly the deputy commander of GRU unit 43292, which serves as training center for Special Operations Forces, the Moscow Times reported. Russian Telegram channel Baza reported that Klenkov was shot at on the side of a road in the town of Melenki, east of Moscow. The assailant reportedly fire eight shots from the window of a car. Russian state media reported that an investigation into the shooting is ongoing. The Kyiv Independent could not verify any of the reports in Russian state media. It is currently unclear if the attack was intended as politically-motivated assassination. Kyiv has not commented on the situation. In July, another officer from Russia&apos;s GRU had his feet blown off in a car bomb attack in Moscow. Kyiv has denied any involvement in that attack. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak told independent Russian media he believed there was &quot;a malfunction with the gas equipment in the car.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/high-ranking-gru-officer-shot-dead-in-moscow-oblast-russian-media-reports/	2024-10-16T21:32:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/gettyimages-2157284098-612x612.jpg
Ramstein meeting rescheduled to November in virtual format, White House says	The White House has rescheduled a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group to November in a virtual setting after U.S. President Joe Biden cancelled his foreign trips earlier this month to handle the consequences of repeated hurricanes at home. The announcement was made following a call between Biden and President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 16 to discuss $425 million in new security assistance for Ukraine. Biden was initially supposed to convene a leader-level meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Germany on Oct. 12, but postponed amid the approach of Hurricane Milton. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group is the U.S.-led group consisting of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The last Ramstein meeting on Sept. 6 was the group&apos;s 24th gathering since its establishment in April 2022. The upcoming virtual Ramstein meeting will be the first one held on a leader-level. During the last one Zelensky was present in person, securing more military aid from allies, including the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Canada. At the initially planned Ramstein meeting, Zelensky was set to present his five-point victory plan to allies, although he met with leaders individually following the summit&apos;s postponement. The victory plan, which was publicly unveiled on Oct. 16, is comprised of five points: an invitation to join NATO, a defense aspect, deterrence of Russian aggression, economic growth and cooperation, and post-war security architecture. Before the initial summit was postponed, the Washington Post (WP) reported, citing an undisclosed diplomat, that Ukraine may be offered &quot;more concrete steps&quot; regarding its NATO membership during the upcoming Ramstein summit. U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said on Oct. 16 that NATO does not currently have plans to invite Ukraine into the alliance &quot;in the short term.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ramstein-meeting-rescheduled-to-november-in-virtual-format-white-house-says/	2024-10-16T20:30:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2096199937.jpg
NATO does not have plans to invite Ukraine into the alliance 'in the short term,' US Ambassador says	NATO does not currently have plans to invite Ukraine into the alliance in the immediate future, U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said on Oct. 16. &quot;I think NATO&apos;s position on this is very clear. We stated at the 75th anniversary summit this summer that Ukraine is on an irreversible path to membership and that Ukraine will become a member of the Alliance. We are not at the stage where the Alliance is discussing issuing an invitation in the short term,&quot; Smith said ahead of a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels, Voice of America reported. &quot;But, as always, we will continue talks with our friends in Ukraine about how they can move toward the Alliance,&quot; Smith added. Smith&apos;s comments come as President Volodymyr Zelensky publicly unveiled his five-point victory plan, which include Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO placed atop of the list. &quot;If the plan is supported, we can end the war no later than next year,&quot; Zelensky said in the parliament in the presence of Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov, and Western diplomats. Kyiv submitted its application to join in September 2022, and in July 2024 the alliance affirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership&quot; - though Ukraine has not received any definitive news about its future accession. According to the information obtained by the Kyiv Independent, Kyiv had planned to ask for NATO membership within the months, not years. The Financial Times (FT) reported on Oct. 1, citing an unnamed Western official, that U.S. President Joe Biden may agree to advance the status of Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership bid before leaving office in January. It is unclear as to whether Smith&apos;s comments suggest a possible policy shift by the Biden administration. According to Zelensky, who has repeatedly called on partners to issue a membership invitation to Kyiv, Ukraine will join NATO only after Russia&apos;s full-scale war ends.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-does-not-plan-to-invite-ukraine-into-the-alliance-in-the-short-term-us-ambassador-says/	2024-10-16T19:31:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1572212824.jpg
UK investigating whether Russia planted incendiary device that caused parcel fire at warehouse, Guardian reports	U.K. counter-terrorism officials are investigating whether Russian intelligence officers planted an incendiary device inside a parcel that caught fire at a warehouse near Birmingham, the Guardian reported on Oct. 16. The fire, which erupted at a DHL warehouse on July 22, is believed to have been transported to the location on an airliner. The fire did not cause any injuries or significant damage, investigators said. It is unclear as to whether the plane was a cargo or passenger airliner, and where the plane was destined for. Investigators are also examining whether a similar parcel fire caused by an incendiary device - which erupted as it was being loaded onto a flight at a DHL facility in Leipzig, Germany - are connected. Intelligence agencies across Europe have warned that Russia is plotting violent acts of sabotage across the continent in response to countries&apos; support for Ukraine. On Monday, Germany&apos;s intelligence chief told the members of the Bundestag that had the packaged engulfed on the flight it was bound for, the fire &quot;would have resulted in a crash.&quot; When reached by the Guardian, DHL said it was working &quot;to secure its network, staff and assets as well as customer shipments&quot; following the fires at its facilities. Earlier in May, the United Kingdom&apos;s domestic counter-intelligence and security agency Mi5 was ordered to prioritize targeting spies over terrorists due to a significant recruitment drive by Russia, China, and Iran. Last week, MI5&apos;s Director General Ken McCallum said that Russia&apos;s military intelligence agency (GRU) &quot;is on a sustained mission to generate mayhem on British and European streets: we&#x2019;ve seen arson, sabotage and more.&quot; In April, it was reported that Dylan Earl, a 20-year-old U.K. citizen with alleged ties to the Wagner mercenary group, had been charged with organizing an arson plot after being recruited as a Russian spy. The same month, German authorities also arrested two German-Russian nationals suspected of planning a military sabotage plot on behalf of Russian intelligence. Several other suspects have been arrested over the past year in Poland, Austria, Denmark, Estonia, and other countries for allegedly spying for Russia or other forms of collaboration with Russian intelligence.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-investigating-whether-russia-planted-explosive-device-that-caused-parcel-fire-at-warehouse-guardian-reports/	2024-10-16T18:32:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-04-083245.jpg
NATO Secretary General Rutte announces Ukraine-NATO Council meeting	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte announced that the next meeting of the Ukraine-NATO Council is scheduled for Oct. 17. The meeting will bring together defense ministers from NATO member states alongside Ukraine&#x2019;s defense minister, Rustem Umerov. Key topics on the agenda are expected to include the current situation on the battlefield in Ukraine and the most pressing needs of the Ukrainian military. Rutte also noted that progress is being made in establishing a new NATO command in Wiesbaden, aimed at coordinating aid and training for Ukrainian troops, as well as fulfilling the commitment to provide Ukraine with 40 billion euros in military assistance. &quot;NATO Allies provided 20.9 billion euros in military assistance to Ukraine during the first half of 2024 and Allies are on track to meet their commitments for the rest of the year,&quot; adding that &quot;the message is clear: NATO is delivering for Ukraine, and we will continue to do so.&quot; Earlier, Rutte reaffirmed NATO&apos;s support for Ukraine: &quot;The message (to Russian President Vladimir Putin) is that we will continue, that we will do what&#x2019;s necessary to make sure that he will not get his way, that Ukraine will prevail,&quot; NATO Secretary General said during a joint interview with Reuters and German radio Hessischer Rundfunk on Oct. 13. However, despite Rutte&apos;s reassurances, concerns are mounting over the future of Western support as the U.S. election approaches. Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump has expressed a desire to &quot;get (the U.S.) out&quot; of the war, raising fears that he may reduce or withdraw support.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-secretary-general-rutte-announces-ukraine-nato-council-meeting/	2024-10-16T14:12:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2101931335.jpg
Ukraine war latest: US announces $425 million in security aid for Ukraine, Zelensky says package includes long-range weapons	Key developments on Oct. 16: U.S. President Joe Biden announced $425 million in new security assistance for Ukraine during a phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 16. Biden and Zelensky spoke on the phone after the U.S. president canceled foreign trips to handle the consequences of repeated hurricanes at home. The new package will consist of &quot;additional air defense capability, air-to-ground munitions, armored vehicles, and critical munitions to meet Ukraine&apos;s urgent needs,&quot; the White House said in a statement. In the upcoming months, the U.S. will also provide Ukraine with &quot;a range of additional capabilities, including hundreds of air defense interceptors, dozens of tactical air defense systems, additional artillery systems, significant quantities of ammunition, hundreds of armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles, and thousands of additional armored vehicles,&quot; the White House said. In a post on X, Zelensky thanked the U.S. for the new package and said that it also includes &quot;long-range weapons.&quot; He did not specify which kind of weapons and did not mention the ongoing debate over allowing Western weapons to be used for long-range strikes into Russia. Biden and Zelensky also discussed the victory plan, which was presented to individual leaders, including Biden, behind closed doors in September but made public earlier on Oct. 16. President Volodymyr Zelensky presented Ukraine&apos;s much-debated victory plan at parliament on Oct. 16, though some parts remained classified. The proposal is comprised of five points: an invitation to join NATO, a defense aspect, deterrence of Russian aggression, economic growth and cooperation, and post-war security architecture. The plan involves three secret addenda that have been shared with international partners. David Arakhamia, the ruling party&apos;s parliamentary leader, said the classified parts would be presented to faction leaders. &quot;If the plan is supported, we can end the war no later than next year,&quot; Zelensky said in the parliament in the presence of Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov, and Western diplomats. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s victory plan is a plan to strengthen our state and our position. To be strong enough to end the war. To make sure that Ukraine has all its muscles,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;This plan can be implemented. It depends on our partners. I emphasize: on partners. It definitely does not depend on Russia.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO was placed at the top of the list. Kyiv submitted its application to join in September 2022 but has yet to receive a clear signal from allies. &quot;We understand that NATO membership is a matter for the future, not the present,&quot; Zelensky said, but added that an invitation offered right away would show Russian President Vladimir Putin the error of &quot;his geopolitical calculations.&quot; &quot;We are a democratic nation that has proven that it can protect our common way of life.&quot; The second article stresses the need to bring the war to Russian territory, such as during the cross-border Kursk incursion launched in early August. This will prevent the creation of possible &quot;buffer zones&quot; on Ukrainian territory. This item also calls for lifting restrictions on long-range strikes in Russia, additional supplies of long-range capabilities, and Western support in downing Russian missiles and drones over Ukraine. Additional support in building up Ukrainian ground forces, air defenses, defense investment, intelligence assistance, and other military aid will help strengthen Ukraine and dissuade the Russian population from their &quot;ideology of war,&quot; the president said. The third point refers to non-nuclear deterrence, one part of which will remain classified. Ukraine is proposing a &quot;comprehensive non-nuclear strategic deterrence package on its territory&quot; that would safeguard the country against future aggression. This point has been detailed to the leaders of the U.S., the U.K., Germany, France, and Italy. The fourth part addresses Ukraine&apos;s use of its natural resources, such as uranium, titanium, and lithium, which present economic growth potential for Kyiv and the EU. Ukraine is offering a special agreement on joint investment and use of these resources with the EU and the U.S. The part further calls for ramping up international sanctions against Russia to undermine its ability to sustain its aggression. This fourth section also contains a classified section that was shared with Western partners. The fifth part concerns Ukraine&apos;s post-war security architecture. Zelensky said Kyiv boasts a large and experienced military force that can strengthen NATO and the security of the European continent. &quot;If the partners agree, then after the war, we envisage replacing certain U.S. military contingents stationed in Europe with Ukrainian units,&quot; the president said. &quot;If Putin achieves his insane geopolitical, military, ideological, and economic goals, it will create an overwhelming impression for other potential aggressors, particularly in the Gulf region, the Indo-Pacific region, and Africa, that wars of aggression can be profitable for them as well,&quot; the president told lawmakers. Zelensky noted that Putin&apos;s &quot;coalition of criminals&quot; now includes North Korea, which has provided not only weapons but also personnel for Russian factories and the military. &quot;This is effectively participation of a second state in the war against Ukraine on Russia&apos;s side.&quot; The president also highlighted the support provided by Iran and China. &quot;We must implement the victory plan to force Russia to be at the peace summit and ready to end the war.&quot; Australia will donate Ukraine 49 &quot;soon-to-be-retired&quot; U.S.-made Abrams tanks, the Australian media outlet ABC News reported on Oct. 16, citing Defense Industry Minister Pat Conroy. The delivery comes after a controversy erupted earlier in 2024 when media reports emerged that the Australian military decided to quietly disassemble and bury its fleet of multi-role Taipan helicopters, even though Kyiv sent an official request for their transfer to Ukraine. Conroy told reporters that it was &quot;time to move on&quot; about the Taipan helicopters and made no indication that the decision to give Ukraine the Abrams tanks was related to the backlash over their non-delivery. The tanks will be delivered as part of a larger package of military aid worth 245 million Australian dollars ($163 million). &quot;These tanks will deliver more firepower and mobility to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and complement the support provided by our partners for Ukraine&apos;s armored brigades &#x2014; Australia has been steadfast in our support for Ukraine,&quot; Conroy said. Ukraine&apos;s ambassador to Australia, Vasyl Myroshnychenko, said that the delivery of tanks was a &quot;significant contribution&quot; that would be an &quot;essential part of our land defenses.&quot; Since the beginning of the full-scale war, Australia has provided Ukraine with more than $1 billion in aid, including $866 million in military assistance. Units of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) liberated 400 hectares (988 acres) of forest in Kharkiv Oblast, killing a number of Russian soldiers, the agency reported on Oct. 16. The operation was conducted north of the village of Lyptsi, located 10 kilometers (6 miles) south of the Russian border. The village was under Russian occupation from February to September 2022, and was again targeted during Russia&apos;s renewed offensive against Kharkiv Oblast in 2024. The time frame and duration of the operation were not disclosed. According to HUR, Ukrainian soldiers captured a Russian battalion defense area, destroyed three motorized rifle battalions, a Storm platoon, and a reconnaissance company of Russia&apos;s Seventh Separate Motorized Rifle Regiment. The units also reportedly took over Russian captives. &quot;After clearing 400 hectares of forest north of Lyptsi, the situation of the invaders on this section of the front is deteriorating and close to hopeless,&quot; the agency claimed. &quot;The successful HUR mission sets conditions for further ousting the Russian occupiers from the northern part of Kharkiv Oblast.&quot; In August, Ukraine&apos;s 3rd Assault Brigade launched a successful counterattack in Kharkiv Oblast, advancing almost 2 square kilometers deep into the front line area. The elite 3rd Brigade has been holding the line near the village of Borova in Kharkiv Oblast, repelling repeated Russian assaults. Earlier in October, the brigade said it had managed to regain positions and free a group of captive Ukrainian soldiers during an engagement with a Russian sabotage group in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-35/	2024-10-16T12:15:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173586535.jpg
Russia ramps up attacks in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Will there be a large-scale offensive?	Fears of a larger Russian offensive in Zaporizhzhia Oblast are growing as Russian forces have reportedly made progress along the border between Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts and intensified air strikes on the regional capital. &quot;If they achieve a breakthrough, Russia will be able to fire at logistical routes connecting Zaporizhzhia to the east of Ukraine,&quot; Southern Defense Forces spokesperson Vladyslav Voloshyn said earlier this month in response to reports of Russian forces amassing for a breakthrough in the direction of Orikhiv and Mala Tokmachka, around 50 kilometers southeast of Zaporizhzhia. &quot;Russia will try to succeed at any cost to cut off our logistics,&quot; he said. The developments come at a crucial time in the war, with both Russia and Ukraine aiming to strengthen their positions ahead of possible peace talks. In recent months, Russian forces have made advances in Ukraine&#x2019;s east, including the capture of the key town of Vuhledar in early October. Having a significant advantage in troops and weapons, Russia is showing no signs of abandoning its goal of seizing more Ukrainian territory. Zaporizhzhia Oblast, in southeastern Ukraine, is one of the four oblasts Russia claims to have annexed in September 2022, although Ukrainian forces still control about a third of the oblast, including the regional capital. A map showing ssessed control of terrain in Zaporizhzhia Oblast as of Oct. 2024. (Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)Experts believe that it&apos;s too soon to say whether these recent moves signal the start of a major offensive in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, but such an operation seems unlikely in the near future, as Russia remains focused on the eastern front. &#x201C;I doubt Russia has the forces available to sustain such an offensive while continuing its offensive operations in Donetsk Oblast, which seems to be the priority,&#x201D; John Hardie, deputy director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the Kyiv Independent. In line with warnings last month from the Ukrainian military, Russia has intensified its assaults along the border between Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, reportedly making some limited tactical gains in recent days. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Oct. 14 that its forces had captured the village of Levadne in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, which is located about 170 kilometers (105 miles) from the city of Zaporizhzhia. When asked about this by the Kyiv Independent, Voloshyn said the situation &quot;is developing quite dynamically,&quot; noting that neither side could regain the initiative. The crowd-sourced monitoring group DeepState shows Levadne in the grey zone as of Oct. 16, 2024. Russian and Ukrainian sources also reported Russian advances toward the nearby village of Novodarivka and in areas southwest of Velyka Novosilka. In the past two days, Russian forces carried out ground assaults near Robotyne, Mala Tokmachka, and Novodanylivka in the central part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, but no confirmed gains were made, according to an Oct. 14 report from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). The area was the focus of Ukraine&#x2019;s 2023 southern counteroffensive, which saw the liberation of Robotyne and several other small settlements but didn&#x2019;t result in a major breakthrough.

Ukraine&#x2019;s military had been reporting since late September that Russian troops and equipment were being amassed for assault operations in the region. However, Voloshyn said that Russia was only carrying out local ground assaults and would require larger forces for a full-blown offensive in the region. Petro Andryushchenko, an advisor to the mayor of the Russian-occupied Mariupol, shared a video on Oct. 14 allegedly showing Russian forces transferring large numbers of troops from Russian-occupied Novoazovsk through Mariupol in Donetsk Oblast toward the occupied Polohy district, which is located closer to the front line in eastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast. At the same time, Russia has increased air strikes on Zaporizhzhia, causing numerous civilian casualties and damaging infrastructure. Russian troops began using highly destructive guided aerial bombs against Zaporizhzhia for the first time on Sept. 23. Before that, the city was targeted only with missiles and drones. According to Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Ivan Fedorov, Russia-launched guided aerial bombs reach the city within minutes. These bombs are almost impossible to shoot down, and Russia is producing them in large quantities. Despite the constant risk of a broader Russian offensive on all sectors of the front line, current Russian actions in Zaporizhzhia Oblast remain relatively limited, with the primary focus still on Ukrainian-held areas of Donetsk Oblast, according to experts interviewed by the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;In Zaporizhzhia, the Russians have likely made some local gains, but nothing that would alter the general situation significantly in the area,&#x201D; said Emil Kastehelmi, an analyst at the Finland-based Black Bird Group. &#x201C;Levadne is barely a village &#x2014; there are only a few buildings, and the biggest of them, which could act as a shelter for vehicles, has been blown to pieces. Capturing Levadne would mean an advance of around three kilometers over a couple of fields.&#x201D; Hardie said it&#x2019;s unclear yet whether the recent Russian advances near Levadne and Novodarivka signal a sustained axis of attack in that area. &#x201C;Russia previously conducted some attacks in the Velyka Novosilka direction, capturing Urozhaine and Staromaiorske over the summer, though nothing more came of it,&#x201D; he said. According to Hardie, Russia is also currently attacking toward Velyka Novosilka from the Zolota Nyva area near Vuhledar, which is &#x201C;consistent with Russia&apos;s broader effort to push Ukrainian forces out of southern Donetsk Oblast.&#x201D; Sambist with the Ukrainian Volunteer Army releases a surveillance drone his team will fly over Russian occupied territory from a position in the Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine on Sep. 14, 2023 (Lynsey Addario/Getty Images)Kastehelmi highlighted that these recent Russian ground attacks in Zaporizhzhia Oblast were carried out with &quot;relatively limited forces,&quot; suggesting Russian forces have not switched the main areas of their focus. &#x201C;It&apos;s possible they&apos;re just the decisions of local commanders,&#x201D; he added. Given the amount of resources Moscow has deployed to counter Ukraine&#x2019;s ongoing incursion into Kursk Oblast, which began on Aug. 6, Konrad Muzyka, a defense analyst focusing on Russia and Belarus and the head of Rochan Consulting, suggests it is unlikely the Russian military has the capacity for large-scale offensive operations in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. He added that Russia may be trying to give the impression of preparing for something larger to force Ukraine to spread its forces and commit reserves. The ISW echoed this sentiment in its Oct. 13 report, saying that it has not observed Russia amassing the manpower and resources needed for a major offensive like those seen in eastern Ukraine. &#x201C;Russian forces, on the contrary, have redeployed forces that were previously in the Donetsk-Zaporizhia Oblast border area, and elsewhere in southern Ukraine to respond to Ukraine&#x2019;s incursion in Kursk,&#x201D; it said. According to the ISW, this reactivation in less active areas of the front in southern Ukraine might be an attempt &#x201C;to divert Ukrainian attention away from Russia&#x2019;s priority offensive operations in Donetsk Oblast, and to fix Ukrainian forces along the front in southern Ukraine,&#x201D; The situation could change if Ukraine were to unexpectedly withdraw from Kursk Oblast, freeing up Russian forces, suggested Hardie. &#x201C;But that&apos;s obviously quite unlikely,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;And even if that were to happen, I suspect Russia would choose to reinforce its offensives in Donetsk Oblast or the Kupiansk direction (in Kharkiv Oblast).&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-advances-in-zaporizhzhia-oblast-limited-as-focus-remains-on-eastern-front-experts-say/	2024-10-16T11:07:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1770835562.jpg

Biden and Zelensky also discussed the victory plan, which was presented to individual leaders, including Biden, behind closed doors in September but made public earlier on Oct. 16.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-announces-425-million-in-new-security-assistance-for-ukraine/	2024-10-16T10:44:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2174693598.jpg
SBU arrests Ukrenergo security head for allegedly justifying Russia's war, supporting murder of civilians	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) arrested one of the heads of security of the state-owned energy company Ukrenergo for allegedly justifying Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, questioning the existence of an independent Ukrainian state, and supporting the murder of civilians, the SBU said on Oct. 16. The media outlet RBC-Ukraine reported, citing unnamed sources, that the individual in question was Oleh Hrybenko, who is reportedly responsible for maintaining the security of critical infrastructure facilities. The SBU did not name the suspect. Beyond the suspect&apos;s anti-Ukrainian, pro-Russian rhetoric, the SBU said that he had also leaked information about the consequences of strikes on critical infrastructure facilities. In a post on Telegram, Ukrenergo said it had suspended one of its employees in relation to the case. &quot;Any manifestations of justification for Russian aggression are unacceptable for the Ukrenergo team,&quot; it said. Ukrenergo added that nine of its employees have been killed by Russian attacks during their official duties, and another 11 have been killed fighting in the army. If convicted, the suspect faces up to eight years in prison.	https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-arrests-ukrenergo-official-for-allegedly-justifying-russias-war-supporting-murder-of-civilians/	2024-10-16T09:43:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-16-20_39_55.jpeg

Australia to give Ukraine almost 50 US-made Abrams tanks	Australia will donate Ukraine 49 &quot;soon-to-be-retired&quot; U.S.-made Abrams tanks, the Australian media outlet ABC News reported on Oct. 16, citing Defense Industry Minister Pat Conroy. The delivery comes after a controversy erupted earlier in 2024 when media reports emerged that the Australian military decided to quietly disassemble and bury its fleet of multi-role Taipan helicopters, even though Kyiv sent an official request for their transfer to Ukraine. Conroy told reporters that it was &quot;time to move on&quot; about the Taipan helicopters and made no indication that the decision to give Ukraine the Abrams tanks was related to the backlash over their non-delivery. The tanks will be delivered as part of a larger package of military aid worth 245 million Australian dollars ($163 million). &quot;These tanks will deliver more firepower and mobility to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and complement the support provided by our partners for Ukraine&apos;s armored brigades &#x2014; Australia has been steadfast in our support for Ukraine,&quot; Conroy said. Ukraine&apos;s ambassador to Australia, Vasyl Myroshnychenko, said that the delivery of tanks was a &quot;significant contribution&quot; that would be an &quot;essential part of our land defenses.&quot; Since the beginning of the full-scale war, Australia has provided Ukraine with more than $1 billion in aid, including $866 million in military assistance.	https://kyivindependent.com/australia-to-give-ukraine-almost-50-us-made-abrams-tanks/	2024-10-16T08:25:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1532148176.jpeg
Missile fragments found in Moldova by Ukrainian border	Missile fragments were found near the Moldovan village of Lencauti, located just 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from the Ukrainian border, the country&apos;s border police reported on Oct. 16. The border police said the scene was being investigated but did not comment on where the fragments had come from. It was not the first time that missile and drone debris have been found on Moldovan territory. After fragments of a Shahed-type drone were discovered on Moldovan territory in February 2024, President Maia Sandu said, &quot;Russia&apos;s war on Ukraine hits close to home in Moldova &#x2014; again. The discovery of Shahed drone debris in southern Moldova today serves as another stark reminder of the grim reality we face.&quot; &quot;Russia&apos;s aggression endangers the entire continent. Support for Ukraine must continue.&quot; Previously, Russian drone strikes against Odesa Oblast led to drone debris being found also on Romanian soil in the autumn of 2023. In response, Bucharest instituted additional security measures in the border region, which included building shelters and air defense systems.	https://kyivindependent.com/missile-fragments-found-in-moldova-by-ukrainian-border/	2024-10-16T07:15:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1771534046.jpg
Scholz says he is open to talk to Putin about peace in Ukraine	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told lawmakers in Berlin on Oct. 16 that he is willing to talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin about a &quot;just peace&quot; in Ukraine. Scholz emphasized that he would speak to Putin &quot;if asked&quot; but stressed that no decisions would be made without the input of Ukraine or other Western allies. In recent weeks, German media have reported on an increased openness from Scholz to speak to Putin about an end to the full-scale war in Ukraine. The two leaders have not spoken since December 2022, the same year the leaders of the U.S., France, and the U.K. last had direct contact. Earlier in October, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claimed that Moscow had not received a proposal for Scholz and Putin to talk. The statement came two days after German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said that Putin is not willing to speak with Scholz about brokering peace in Ukraine. &quot;He refuses to accept peace and every day sends another signal in favor of war and destruction. These days, he is no longer even prepared to speak to (Scholz) on the phone,&quot; the German foreign minister said. It is unclear if any developments regarding a potential conversation between Scholz and Putin have happened since Baerbock and Peskov&apos;s comments.	https://kyivindependent.com/scholz-says-he-is-open-to-talk-to-putin-about-peace-in-ukraine/	2024-10-16T06:36:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177153600.jpg
Ukrainian MPs react to Zelensky's victory plan — 'Great agenda' but practical steps unclear	Ukrainian lawmakers voiced their first reactions to President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s presentation of Ukraine&apos;s victory plan to parliament on Oct. 16, praising the overall agenda but calling out the supposed lack of practical steps. Some opposition lawmakers criticized it for being too vague and relying too much on international partners while omitting domestic issues, such as pro-democratic and anti-graft reforms that they say are key to Ukraine&#x2019;s success and important in achieving NATO membership. The victory plan includes five points: an invitation to join NATO, a defense aspect, a non-nuclear deterrence against Russian aggression, an economic aspect, and a post-war security architecture. Three addenda remained classified but have been shared with Western partners. Zelensky pitched the plan to the leaders of the U.S., the U.K., Germany, France, and Italy in an effort to drum up support before the uncertain U.S. presidential elections. The proposal has been kept mostly secret from the public until now. Roman Lozynskyi, a lawmaker formerly from the opposition Holos (Voice) party, wrote on Facebook that the plan has a &quot;great agenda,&quot; but the actual steps to achieve them remain unclear. &quot;On one hand, the victory plan sounds like a fantasy. On the other hand, so did the Patriots, Storm Shadow, the F-16s, sinking a chunk of the (Russian) Black Sea Fleet, and controlling part of Kursk Oblast.&quot; Lozynskyi stressed that everything now rests &quot;on the decisions of partners and the success of our diplomacy&quot; as well as on the unity among the Ukrainian leadership and the opposition. In presenting the plan to parliament, Zelensky said it is &#x201C;a plan to strengthen our state and our position. To be strong enough to end the war. To make sure that Ukraine has all its muscles.&#x201D; &quot;This plan can be implemented. It depends on our partners. I emphasize: on partners. It definitely does not depend on Russia,&quot; Zelensky said. Lozynskyi also said that Zelensky did not explain, however, how he plans to implement the plan&#x2019;s various points, adding that it may not be wise to make these steps public. Yaroslav Yurchyshyn from the Holos party highlighted that the victory plan has been agreed upon with the Ukrainian military command and is being coordinated with Western partners. &#x201C;I have no doubt that many people have ideas and comments on what and how to improve it. However, for me&#x2026; the best criticism is action.&#x201D; Oleksii Honcharenko, a lawmaker from the opposition European Solidarity party led by former president Petro Poroshenko, criticized the plan for supposedly relying too much on outside assistance without requiring steps from the Ukrainian leadership. &quot;Where is the clause on the fight against corruption, on strengthening our democratic institutions?&quot; Hocharenko wrote on Telegram. The lawmaker described the plan as &quot;empty words&quot; that are &quot;removed from reality.&quot; Honcharenko&apos;s party colleague, Iryna Herashchenko, praised the plan&apos;s general goals but also criticized its focus on international support, noting that the word &quot;partners&quot; has been used more often than &quot;Ukraine&quot; and &quot;Russia.&quot; She also pointed out the absence of &quot;homework&quot; Ukraine needs to do to achieve these goals, such as anti-corruption reforms that are a necessary step for NATO membership. &quot;I wonder why the president has come to parliament now? For me, this is a signal of the seriousness of the situation at the front, in the economy, of the shift on the global stage,&quot; the lawmaker said. &quot;The return of the borders of 1991... is no longer heard... (but) the fact that certain territories may have to be liberated through political, diplomatic measures was also not heard.&quot; A third European Solidarity lawmaker, Mykola Kniazhytskyi, presented a less scathing commentary. &#x201C;The most important thing (Zelensky) said was&#x2026; that Ukrainian troops could replace, in particular, American troops in Europe, partners&apos; troops, because they have experience,&quot; the lawmaker told the Kyiv Independent. According to Kniazhytskyi, the presentation of Zelensky&apos;s victory plan may play a role in the upcoming U.S. election. &#x201C;The themes voiced by President Zelensky will obviously be used by Democrats in the presidential campaign. It will be difficult for the Republicans to object to them... That is, it can be used by both parties in the U.S,&#x201D; Kniazhytskyi said. &#x201C;If this plan is agreed with Western allies, I&apos;m (fully in support of the plan). If they are not ready for it, and he is only talking about it for the sake of PR, then it will be a big disappointment.&#x201D; Unlike some opposition lawmakers, the parliamentary leader of Zelensky&apos;s Servant of the People party praised the plan as a &quot;very detailed document&quot; offering Kyiv&apos;s partners a &quot;strategy of mutual reinforcement.&quot; &quot;Without our victory, without an honest and fair peace for Ukraine, the world will not be able to feel safe,&quot; David Arakhamia said on Telegram. &quot;But a strong, independent, and European Ukraine will be able to contribute to the collective security of the entire continent,&quot; Arakhamia commented, highlighting Kyiv&apos;s role in the plan. The top lawmaker from Zelensky&apos;s party also revealed that after the presentation, the president held a meeting with parliamentary leaders. Arakhamia told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15 that the classified parts of the plan would be shared only with the parliamentary leadership. As Ukrainian lawmakers react to the victory plan, Western partners have remained mostly tight-lipped. The U.S. State Department said diplomatically that the proposal includes &quot;a number of productive steps,&quot; though some partners were reportedly &quot;unimpressed&quot; with the plan. Several Western officials believe it leans too heavily on additional arms supplies and on lifting restrictions on their use and does not bring many new ideas to the table, the Wall Street Journal reported in September.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-mps-react-to-zelenskys-victory-plan-great-agenda-but-practical-steps-unclear/	2024-10-16T05:56:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Zelensky-Oct-16.jpeg
Opinion: Pakistan can’t walk the tightrope between Russia and the West forever	Imran Khan, cricket star and then-prime minister of Pakistan, visited Russia on Feb. 23-24, 2022 &#x2013; the first visit by a Pakistani leader to Russia in over two decades. On the second day of his visit, Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Some political analysts suspected that Khan&#x2019;s visit was simply another impulsive move, made without consulting experienced policymakers. However, two and a half years and two prime ministers later, Pakistan&#x2019;s relationship with Russia continues to warm. In September, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Overchuk visited Pakistan, where he met with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and held a joint press conference with Pakistani Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar, announcing intentions to improve economic cooperation and bilateral trade. In a context where Russia is increasingly alienating itself from the global community due to its war in Ukraine, why is a large, developing South Asian country so keen on rapprochement? Pakistan and Russia have never been particularly close allies, but they have been inching closer in recent years. This warning relationship is marked by their signing of a bilateral defense coordination agreement in 2014 and Russia&#x2019;s support for Pakistan joining the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in 2017. Pakistan also accepted Russia&#x2019;s invitation to join Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s International North-South Transport Corridor, which Putin envisions stretching from Europe to the Middle East and India &#x2013; a new Silk Road or a competing Belt and Road Initiative. Security cooperation has also ramped up, with joint military exercises in 2016 and 2018. This reflects the convergence of Russo-Pakistani interests. First, the Kremlin is looking to Islamabad for support in tackling violent extremism on its periphery, particularly related to the instability created by the wars in Afghanistan. Secondly, Putin and some Pakistani leaders share similar views on freedom of speech; blasphemy is a capital crime in Pakistan, and Khan previously expressed gratitude to Putin for speaking out in support of respect for the Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him). Finally, economic interests tie the two countries together. Pakistan is experiencing an energy crisis, while Russia is seeking more buyers for its oil. In contrast, Pakistan&#x2019;s relations with Ukraine have been more limited. After independence, Pakistan and Ukraine established ties quickly, but these have been restricted to minor military, economic, and trade cooperation &#x2013; particularly Pakistan&#x2019;s purchase of defense equipment. However, this relationship has been growing, with both sides investing more energy in defense production collaborations and joint ventures. Ukraine has also become a major wheat exporter to Pakistan, with nearly 1.4 million metric tons of wheat imported from Ukraine in 2020-2021.

(Kremlin Press Office/Handout/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)With the outbreak of war, Pakistan&#x2019;s geopolitical trajectory in Eastern Europe has not changed significantly because the underlying drivers shaping its relationships with Russia and Ukraine remain the same. Underpinning its energy needs, food security concerns, and political ties is the necessity of building relationships that offer Pakistan stability and security amid considerable regional competition. Pakistan was created in 1947 when the British Raj was divided into India and Pakistan (and modern-day Bangladesh). Pakistan has gone to war with India several times, and the insecurity it feels from India on its eastern border remains one of its greatest existential threats and a significant driver of its politics and security calculations. Today, Indo-Pakistani relations are stable, as both countries have more pressing issues to address, but competition remains intense. Notably, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is currently focused on strengthening regional ties. India also maintains a much stronger strategic and economic relationship with Russia, which is deeper than Pakistan&#x2019;s, and it has robust and growing ties with the United States. To Pakistan&#x2019;s west lies Afghanistan. For many years, Pakistan was a key regional partner for the U.S., which used it as a base for operations in Afghanistan. This partnership ensured significant U.S. investment in Pakistan, including military training, equipment, and substantial aid. Today, the countries have stable ties, but the U.S. has less incentive to support the Pakistani state beyond the bare minimum. Nevertheless, the U.S. remains a key trade partner and source of aid, particularly through the International Monetary Fund (IMF), so Pakistan cannot afford to alienate them. This may explain Pakistan&#x2019;s multiple statements supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s territorial integrity and sovereignty, the first of which came the day before Khan&#x2019;s visit to Moscow. Finally, to Pakistan&#x2019;s northeast is China. China has a strong presence in Pakistan through trade, investment, and development aid delivered in coordination with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). However, China faces security challenges in Pakistan, particularly regarding terrorism in Balochistan, and it is also concerned about the country&#x2019;s economic instability. Pakistan&#x2019;s political and military leadership now face the challenge of balancing the need to maintain these relationships and fulfill competing interests without alienating any allies. The U.S. is particularly wary of Pakistan&#x2019;s growing ties with China and Russia, but Pakistan feels compelled to pursue alternative relationships as American aid has fallen far short of previous levels. Pakistan&#x2019;s burgeoning relationship with Russia represents a newer attempt to replicate what it has been doing with China for years. The country is trying to secure diplomatic, military, and economic support from Russia without jeopardizing its currently more important relations with the West. Going forward, Pakistan&#x2019;s current leadership is giving every indication that it will continue this balancing act: maintaining ties with both Ukraine and Russia, prioritizing its own economic and security situation above all else. Constrained by its economic and geopolitical status, Pakistan has few close, powerful friends and does not believe it can afford to upset any of its partners. At the same time, it believes that for its own security, it must continue building new ties, even when those countries are engaged in conflict. Despite these political, economic, and security realities, there remains hope that Pakistan will take a more principled approach. As a country founded as a homeland for South Asia&#x2019;s Muslims, ideology has always played a key role. In April 2022, then-Chief of Army Staff General Bajwa said Ukraine&#x2019;s resistance was giving hope to smaller countries that they could defend their territory against larger, aggressive neighbors &#x2013; suggesting some leaders see parallels between Pakistan and Ukraine, and between India and Russia. If Pakistan&#x2019;s leadership truly supports Ukraine, it should adopt a foreign policy that reflects this. While a non-aligned approach has its logic, Pakistan&#x2019;s inconsistent implementation often leads potential partners to mistrust its actions and motives. It can be difficult to predict Pakistan&#x2019;s next move, making stronger partnerships harder to build. By adopting a more principled foreign policy, including on issues like Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, Pakistan can pursue honest and ethical policies that will also foster strong, stable alliances to support its political, economic, and security goals.

Ukraine approves 'electronic warfare resistant' domestic-made Chaklun drone for military use	The domestically produced Chaklun (Wizard) drone has been approved for use by Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, the Defense Ministry said on Oct. 16. The drone can help adjust artillery fire and is resistant to Russian electronic warfare means thanks to &quot;high-tech materials,&quot; the ministry said. The Chaklun can operate in bad weather, and Ukrainian programmers have created control software for the drone. Throughout Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing the way wars are fought. For outnumbered Ukrainian forces, drones have been one of the key weapons to strike Russian warships, naval bases, oil refineries, and airfields inside occupied territories and deep behind Russia&apos;s lines. According to Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, Ukraine has destroyed or damaged over 200 military facilities in Russia over the past year using &quot;drone swarm&quot; technology.	https://kyivindependent.com/chaklun/	2024-10-16T05:35:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-16-151926.png
Kazakhstan won't seek BRICS membership 'in the foreseeable future'	Kazakhstan&apos;s president has &quot;carefully considered&quot; proposals to join BRICS but Astana will not seek to join the group &quot;in the foreseeable future,&quot; a government spokesperson told Tengrinews.kz in an interview published on Oct. 16. BRICS, composed of Russia, China, India, Brazil, and other nations, is a group of emerging economies often portrayed as a counterweight to the Western-led world. &quot;The president (Kassym-Jomart Tokayev) has received proposals on Kazakhstan&apos;s accession to BRICS. After all, our country is recognized as a responsible and authoritative member of the international community,&quot; presidential spokesperson and advisor Berik Uali said. &quot;However, at present and most likely in the foreseeable future, Kazakhstan will refrain from submitting an application to BRICS,&quot; the spokesperson said, citing the &quot;multi-stage application process&quot; and unspecified &quot;development prospects&quot; of the group as the reason. Four new members &#x2013; Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates &#x2013; joined the international organization at the start of 2024. This marked the group&apos;s first expansion since December 2010, when South Africa became a member. Tokayev nevertheless plans to visit an upcoming BRICS forum on Oct. 23-24 in Russia&apos;s Kazan at the invitation of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kazakhstan has been walking a tightrope between Russia and the West since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. While refusing to support Russian aggression and stressing its role as an independent actor, the Central Asian country has become one of the key pathways for sanctioned goods flowing to Russia. Speaking alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz last month in Astana, Tokayev voiced the belief that &quot;Russia cannot be defeated in the military sense.&quot; &quot;A further escalation of war will lead to irreparable consequences for the whole of humanity and above all for the countries involved in the Russia-Ukraine conflict,&quot; Tokayev added.	https://kyivindependent.com/kazakhstan-brics/	2024-10-16T05:02:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1771973857.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — Ukraine braces for winter freeze	The following is the Oct. 15, 2024 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. Ukraine is set to face its toughest winter since the start of the invasion as Russia eyes cutting off its nuclear power after already taking out half its electricity generation sector in attacks. Russia hasn&#x2019;t directly struck nuclear plants with missiles and kamikaze drones but is increasingly targeting nearby infrastructure, such as substations containing crucial equipment that connect nuclear plants to the grid. What could that mean for Ukraine? Large-scale attacks against nuclear infrastructure would freeze out Ukrainians and cause a humanitarian crisis if the country can&#x2019;t swiftly repair and protect those assets. If Russian attacks successfully disconnect all the power plants from the grid, then Ukraine&#x2019;s only stable power source is gone, said Warsaw-based energy analyst Wojciech Jakobik. &#x201C;(Nuclear power) is a baseload capacity, which is irreplaceable by renewables, other sources, and especially not by energy imports,&#x201D; he told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;With a smaller nuclear capacity in place, Ukraine will have less flexibility and less ability to stabilize (energy) generation.&#x201D; Ukraine has lost nine gigawatts of power generation, including eight thermal plants and five hydro plants, due to Russian strikes this year. &#x201C;We&apos;re in a world where (Ukraine) has a deficit of functioning infrastructure. This is going to be the hardest winter yet,&#x201D; International Energy Agency (IEA) Chief Economist Tim Gould told the Kyiv Independent.

(Yurii Stefanyak/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Russia goes after Ukraine&#x2019;s grain exports, againRussia has stepped up its attacks against civilian ships and port infrastructure around Odesa in recent days, in an apparent attempt to cause damage to Ukraine&#x2019;s exports. &quot;The purpose of these attacks is to reduce our export potential,&quot; said Oleksii Kuleba, the minister for the development of communities, territories, and infrastructure. &quot;This is a deliberate attempt to provoke a food crisis in those parts of the world that are directly dependent on Ukrainian grain supplies,&#x201D; he said. What has been hit? Over the past week, Russia has carried out six attacks in the area, killing at least 15 people and injuring over 30. The missile attacks have damaged civilian vessels, including the Palau-flagged Optima, which was hit in an earlier attack on Oct. 7, and the Saint Kitts and Nevis-flagged Paresa which was carrying 6,000 metric tons of corn for export. It&#x2019;s hard to tell yet if these attacks will have a significant impact on arrivals to Ukraine&#x2019;s ports, Bridget Diakun, maritime risk analyst at Lloyd&#x2019;s List Intelligence, told our business reporter Dominic Culverwell. After all, ships traveling to and from the country&#x2019;s ports in the Black Sea know there are risks. &#x201C;From my conversations with the shipping industry, there&apos;s not yet a huge amount of concern although they acknowledge the situation is becoming riskier,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Depending on how the next days/weeks play out could change things.&#x201D; A border guard is seen at the newly renovated &quot;Krakovets - Korchova&quot; checkpoint on the Ukrainian-Polish border near the village of Krakovets in Lviv Oblast, Ukraine on Aug. 16, 2022. (Pavlo Palamarchuk/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Customs reformAt a time when state coffers are starving for money to fund Ukraine&#x2019;s survival, smuggling is costing the country billions of dollars a year in lost customs fees. How much we talking? Through bribery or lying, smugglers avoid an estimated $2.4 to $3 billion in customs payments each year as they smuggle everything from cigarettes and iPhones to perfume and food across the border undeclared or mislabeled. &#x201C;Customs is perhaps the single biggest cash cow that brings corrupt money into Ukraine&apos;s political system. It&#x2019;s the largest tax-evasion scheme in the country,&#x201D; said Josh Rudolph, head of the transatlantic democracy working group of the U.S.-based think tank German Marshall Fund. With mounting internal and external pressure on Ukraine to reign in corruption at the border, parliament has passed an extensive new reform bill to overhaul the State Customs Service. The bill was submitted to the president on Sept. 23 and will take effect after he signs it into law, though its effects of reforms may take years to show up in the state&#x2019;s budget.

(Personal archive of Lunca Bar Team)Kherson bar finds new life in KyivIn late summer of 2022, Lunca Bar owner Yehor Lohvynovskyi and his team were taking a walk in Kyiv when they spotted an empty courtyard &#x2014; &#x201C;We should open a bar in a place like this!&#x201D; one of his coworkers said half-jokingly. None of them knew at the time that the joke would turn into real business plans less than a year later in February 2023. The bar&#x2019;s original location, the southern city of Kherson, while liberated from Kremlin forces in November 2022, was under constant Russian shelling. Russia&#x2019;s destruction of the Kahkovka dam later in 2023 flooded the bar. Rebuilding in Kyiv was the only path forward for the business if it wanted to stay open. Today, Lunca Bar stands in the heart of Kyiv, its vibrant courtyard off of Yaroslaviv Val Street filling up during the warm season. Inside, the team recreated the cozy atmosphere of the Kherson location, with some of the bar&#x2019;s original tables and the walls still adorned with artwork from the city&#x2019;s artists.

(Ukrinform/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Q&amp;A with foreign defense investorsUkraine has become a hotbed of defense innovation, as Russia&#x2019;s deadly invasion fuels a rapid development of new battlefield technologies. But with its economy drained by the war, the country desperately needs foreign investment if it wants to take its innovation to the next level and become a global leader in the defense sector. The government has launched several initiatives to encourage foreign investment, including Brave1, an accelerator program. The Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s reporter Andrea Januta sat down with two foreign investors who have been working as strategic partners with Brave1 to discuss the defense tech sector in Ukraine and how to attract further investment. Despite lower levels of foreign investment in the sector than one would hope, the two are ebullient about the country&#x2019;s prospects. &#x201C;I want to say on the record that we believe that in the next five years, the Ukrainian defense sector will attract half a billion dollars of venture capital,&#x201D; Andre Pienaar, co-founder and chief executive of investment firm C5 Capital said. The Kyiv Independent: How would you describe Ukraine&#x2019;s start-up defense sector right now, and what has changed as it matures? Michael Hewitt: Ukraine has gone from having a traditional defense industry to now shifting its attention to the innovation of asymmetric warfare, drone warfare &#x2014; air, sea, even subsea. What we&apos;re looking to do now is lift that to the next phase of venture capital: growth, scalability, and following exactly what President Zelensky said he wanted to do, which was build capacity in the defense industry. Everything from artillery shell factories to building up the capacity to defend the country and be part of the European defense industry. The Kyiv Independent: A few weeks ago, BraveOne announced Ukraine&#x2019;s defense tech industry had attracted $12 million in private investments since the beginning of the war. This number has grown compared with last year but is still very low compared to other countries. What do you think is stopping investors? Andre Pienaar: I think there are two things that we can do in Ukraine to scale this capital. One is to do as much mentoring among founders as possible about lessons learned, mistakes made, and how to work with outside capital and venture capital. The second thing is that the government does as much as it can to lift restrictions on the export of Ukrainian intellectual property and know-how so that Ukrainian founders can build companies that can really go global and become unicorns.

According to Anduril, their new drones will be capable of flying for 40 minutes and covering a range of 20 kilometers (12 miles). Anduril raised $1.5 billion at the beginning of August in the largest defense tech funding round ever publicized. The Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament, passed in the second reading a bill to increase taxes for the first time since the start of the full-scale invasion as it looks to raise more money for its budget needs. The bill is very unpopular among the business community that feels it unfairly targets taxpayers as the government continues to fail to go after illegal businesses that avoid taxes. The bill still needs to be signed by the president before it goes into effect. The sale of UMCC Titanium &#x2014; one of the largest titanium producers in the world &#x2014; is one of the most high-profile privatizations after the iconic Hotel Ukraina in Kyiv was sold recently in an auction, and is the first successful auction of a large industrial holding in many years. Cemin Ukraine, a Neqsol Holding company owned by Azeri businessman Nasib Hasanov, who also owns Vodafone, Ukraine&#x2019;s second-largest mobile operator, was the sole bidder in the auction. The sale is part of the government&#x2019;s &#x201C;Great Privatization&#x201D; initiative to shore up funds for the wartime budget. &quot;This is a game-changing amount of money,&quot; Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council&apos;s GeoEconomics Center, told Reuters, referring to the combined effect of the new World Bank fund and an announcement the previous day that the EU had approved the 35 billion euro loan as part of the G7 loan. &quot;It&apos;s real resources on the ground that can make a difference,&quot; Lipsky said. The event follows previous conferences in London in 2023 and Berlin in 2024 and is aimed at mobilizing support for Ukraine&apos;s post-war reconstruction and recovery efforts. &quot;Looking at future peace and prosperity also means looking at reconstruction, and I am happy to announce that the &apos;Ukraine Recovery Conference&apos; will be held in Rome on 10-11 July 2025,&quot; Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on Oct. 10 after meeting President Volodymyr Zelensky.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-business-roundup-ukraine-braces-for-winter-freeze/	2024-10-16T03:04:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1249892066.jpg
Ukraine reportedly reclaims territory in north of Kharkiv Oblast, almost entire Russian regiment destroyed	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. Units of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) liberated 400 hectares (988 acres) of forest in Kharkiv Oblast, killing a number of Russian soldiers, the agency reported on Oct. 16. The operation was conducted north of the village of Lyptsi, located 10 kilometers (6 miles) south of the Russian border. The village was under Russian occupation from February to September 2022, and was again targeted during Russia&apos;s renewed offensive against Kharkiv Oblast in 2024. The time frame and duration of the operation were not disclosed. The estimated advance of Russian forces in Kharkiv Oblast as of Oct. 15, 2024, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)According to HUR, Ukrainian soldiers captured a Russian battalion defense area, destroyed three motorized rifle battalions, a Storm platoon, and a reconnaissance company of Russia&apos;s Seventh Separate Motorized Rifle Regiment. The units also reportedly took over Russian captives. &quot;After clearing 400 hectares of forest north of Lyptsi, the situation of the invaders on this section of the front is deteriorating and close to hopeless,&quot; the agency claimed. &quot;The successful HUR mission sets conditions for further ousting the Russian occupiers from the northern part of Kharkiv Oblast.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reclaims-territory-in-north-of-kharkiv-oblast-almost-entire-russian-regiment-destroyed/	2024-10-16T02:55:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-16-121910.png
As Saudi oil hike tests Russia’s war-railed economy, Israeli strikes on Iran could offer boost	Saudi Arabia&#x2019;s oil production hike plan may not break Russia&#x2019;s petro-export-fueled economy, but escalations between Iran and Israel would be a gold rush for Moscow. Since late 2022, the OPEC oil cartel, of which Russia is a member, has withheld oil production and exports to prevent a surplus in the market. But Russia and other members didn&#x2019;t follow the restrictions which got under the skin of OPEC&#x2019;s de facto leader, Saudi Arabia. In response, Riyadh said it would hike oil production in December which could cause global prices to deflate and penalize non-cooperative OPEC members. While Russia will also be allowed to boost oil production, its capacity to do so is far more limited than Saudi Arabia&#x2019;s. Oil and natural gas exports are the backbone of Russia&#x2019;s economy, accounting for around 35-40% of its budget revenues pre-full-scale invasion. The country&#x2019;s energy sector, led by CEOs close to President Vladimir Putin, has kept Russia reliant on fossil fuels to line its pockets with quick profits instead of seeking economic diversification and growth. Russia is already discounting its Ural crude by $12-15 against Brent oil, the global benchmark, to offset the risks associated with Russian trade. On top of Group of Seven (G7) sanctions that have blocked Russia&#x2019;s access to the Western oil market, Moscow and its war efforts could suffer if superior Saudi crude floods the market.

(Maya Siddiqui/Bloomberg via Getty Images)&#x201C;For Russia, this is doubly dangerous because it will firstly force them to drop the prices of their oil to compete in the market, and also find buyers who are willing to take their oil despite existing sanctions,&#x201D; Vaibhav Raghunandan, EU-Russia Analyst at the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), a think tank, told the Kyiv Independent. Currently, Russian Ural crude prices are hovering around $67 per barrel with production costs around $17-18 per barrel. If prices slide to $30 per barrel, Russia&#x2019;s economy would take a major stumble and hamper its war effort in Ukraine, Raghunandan said. For now, this scenario looks unlikely unless there is a global recession, David Fyfe, chief economist at Argus Media, a market analyst group, told the Kyiv Independent. OPEC producers plan to gradually introduce oil to the market at an additional 198,000 barrels per day each month, which is not enough to dramatically reduce prices and suddenly crash Russia&#x2019;s economy, he said. Even if crude prices drop to $50 per barrel, which Riyadh says is a possibility, Russia could sustain itself for six months or more, he added. Fyfe doesn&#x2019;t see enough international demand for the extra barrels. The second quarter of 2025 will be the real test for the market, and it could cause OPEC to U-turn on the decision and cut production again. Russia&#x2019;s oil sector has managed to bypass export sanctions to the West via its shadow fleet, although at incurred costs. Its oil and gas revenues this year jumped by around 50% compared to 2023. However, Russia&#x2019;s export options are limited. Moscow sends nearly half of its crude to China but the country is in the grips of an economic crisis fueled by the property market crash and Beijing&#x2019;s oil demand has likely peaked, limiting Russia&#x2019;s room for growth. &#x201C;It seems highly unlikely that Western Europe and the U.S. is going to be in the market for Russian oil or refined oil products anytime soon,&#x201D; Fyfe said. &#x201C;If Russia wants to boost export revenues, it might sell a bit more (oil) to India. In a given year, it might sell a bit more to China, but there&apos;s not a huge import growth coming from China,&#x201D; he added.

(Akos Stiller/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Moreover, the sanctions that limit Russia&#x2019;s access to Western technology, which its oil assets rely on, could erode the industry over the next five years, he said. Moscow likely has one eye on the potential of tighter sanctions over the next few years, he added. &#xA0; The saving grace for Russia&#x2019;s oil sector would be an escalation in west Asia. Iran&#x2019;s missile attacks on Israel on Oct. 1 caused oil prices to spike by nearly $10 a barrel as concerns arose over an Israeli retaliation. Prices have been pulled back down again by a slightly anemic global economy, but if Israel targets Iran&#x2019;s energy sector then they could jump again, noted Fyfe. Currently, Israel has said it will leave Iran&#x2019;s oil and nuclear facilities alone following alarm bells from the Gulf States. But if this situation does escalate, experts hypothesize that Iran could block the Strait of Hormuz, which sees 15-20% of global oil supplies pass through daily. The result would be a &#x201C;bonanza for the Russian economy and its government&#x201D; as prices skyrocket, said Vasily Astrov, an economist at the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies, a think tank. Yet Iran would be shooting itself in the foot by blocking its own oil exports. Tehran is only likely to resort to the option as a &#x201C;last roll of the dice,&#x201D; Fyfe said.	https://kyivindependent.com/saudi-oil-hike-tests-russias-war-railed-economy-israeli-strikes-on-iran-could-offer-boost/	2024-10-16T02:40:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1229695308.jpg
BREAKING: NATO, long-range strikes, deterrence — Zelensky unveils Ukraine's victory plan	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky presented Ukraine&apos;s much-debated victory plan at parliament on Oct. 16, though some parts remained classified. The proposal is comprised of five points: an invitation to join NATO, a defense aspect, deterrence of Russian aggression, economic growth and cooperation, and post-war security architecture. The plan involves three secret addenda. David Arakhamia, the ruling party&apos;s parliamentary leader, said that the secret items would be presented to faction leaders. &quot;If the plan is supported, we can end the war no later than next year,&quot; Zelensky said in the parliament. Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO was placed at the top of the list. Kyiv submitted its application to join in September 2022 but has yet to receive a clear signal from the allies. The second article stresses the need to bring the war to Russian territory, such as during the cross-border Kursk incursion launched in early August. This item also calls for lifting restrictions on long-range strikes in Russia and Western support in downing Russian missiles and drones over Ukraine. The third point refers to non-nuclear deterrence and includes a secret part. Ukraine is proposing a &quot;comprehensive non-nuclear strategic deterrence package on its territory&quot; that would safeguard the country against future aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-victory-plan/	2024-10-16T02:22:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/29feee4480122502cb728f1cc8bdac91_1659015958_extra_large.jpeg
Biden to meet UK, German, French leaders in Berlin this week, CNN reports	U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to meet the leaders of Germany, France, and the U.K. in Berlin later this week after his earlier visit was postponed due to Hurricane Milton, CNN reported on Oct. 16, citing three unnamed Western officials. Berlin has confirmed that Biden would visit Germany at the end of the week. The trip will reportedly take place on Oct. 18. The U.S., the U.K., Germany, and France are Ukraine&apos;s leading arms suppliers and play a crucial role in supporting Kyiv&apos;s resistance against Russian aggression. It remains unclear whether the upcoming meeting of the Western leaders will lead to major strategic decisions. The U.S. president was supposed to convene a leader-level meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, also known as the Ramstein summit, in Germany on Oct. 12, where Ukraine&apos;s victory plan was to be presented. No new date for the summit was set. Instead, President Volodymyr Zelensky went on a European tour to present his plan to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, hoping to rally support among Western allies. Ukraine&apos;s president pitched the plan to Biden while visiting the U.S. in late September. Ukrainian officials have already revealed certain parts of the plan, namely those related to Western military and political support for Kyiv&apos;s struggle against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Zelensky is pushing for renewed military and financial support from Europe amid concerns that backing could weaken if former U.S. President Donald Trump wins next month&apos;s election. Meanwhile, Russian forces continue to make gains along Ukraine&apos;s eastern front and target critical energy infrastructure as the winter looms. Following Ukraine&apos;s withdrawal from Vuhledar, Russian forces have been focusing their efforts against the Donetsk Oblast towns of Pokrovsk, Toretsk, and Kurakhove, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are slowly losing ground under Russian pressure.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-to-meet-uk-german-french-leaders-in-berlin-this-week-cnn-reports/	2024-10-16T01:58:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161024572-1.jpg
France's first 'kamikaze' drones to arrive in Ukraine 'in the coming weeks'	France successfully tested its first &quot;kamikaze&quot; drones and will deliver them to Ukraine &quot;in the coming weeks,&quot; French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said on Oct. 16. &quot;Tests of France&apos;s first remotely operated munition &#x2013; also called kamikaze drones&quot; had been a &quot;success,&quot; Lecornu said. Drones are an increasingly vital capability in Ukrainian battlefields. Russia has widely used kamikaze drones like Iranian Shaheds to target Ukrainian cities and infrastructure or domestically-made Lancets against Kyiv&apos;s troops. With the rising importance of unmanned systems on modern battlefields, Lecornu said earlier this year that the French military would order 2,000 kamikaze drones. The first 100 will be sent to Ukraine. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video of the French drone&apos;s test published by French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu on X on Oct. 16, 2024.The Colibri loitering ammunition has been under development by France&apos;s Delair and KNDS since last year. The Calibri project was launched to develop a system with a radius of 5 kilometers at a cost of less than 20,000 euros ($22,000) per unit. The drones should be delivered to Ukraine in 2024-2025. Delair has previously provided Ukraine with 100 UX-11 reconnaissance drones and 50 larger DT-26 drones. &quot;Kamikaze drones are absolutely fundamental&quot; and will be able to &quot;complement Caesar howitzers,&quot; the minister said, referring to the advanced artillery systems France has supplied to Ukraine. Since the start of the full-scale war in 2022, France has allocated roughly $3.5 billion in military aid to Ukraine, including Caesar howitzers and AMX-10 armored vehicles. Paris also pledged to provide its Mirage 2000 jets next year.	https://kyivindependent.com/france-to-supply-ukraine-with-kamikaze-drones/	2024-10-16T01:34:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2035946601.jpg
UK preparing suggestions to Ukraine's victory plan, Syrskyi says	The U.K. is working on its own proposals as part of the practical part of Ukraine&apos;s victory plan, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Oct. 16 after a phone call with his British counterpart. Following a conversation with U.K. Chief of Defense Staff Tony Radakin, Syrskyi said that they discussed the possibility of hitting Russian military targets &quot;in operational and strategic depth.&quot; The news came hours before President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s expected presentation of the victory plan during an address to parliament. More sensitive details are expected to be revealed only to parliamentary leaders, the parliamentary leader of the ruling party, David Arakhamia, told the Kyiv Independent. Zelensky was also invited to present his plan at a summit of EU leaders this week. He had already unveiled it to U.S. President Joe Biden and other key partners, including U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer. &quot;Supply of military equipment and weapons, training of personnel, as well as increasing the effectiveness of the use of high-tech means of destruction are the main pillars of Ukrainian-British military cooperation,&quot; Syrskyi added. Top officials have already revealed certain parts of the plan, namely those related to Western military and political support for Kyiv&apos;s struggle against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The key components focus on military, diplomatic, and economic areas, as well as post-war reconstruction. Specific steps include an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO. Ukraine&apos;s cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast also plays a role in creating pressure on Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-working-on-suggestions-to-ukraines-victory-plan-syrskyi-says/	2024-10-16T00:58:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1550396164.jpg
Ukraine's EU entry 'not an existential matter,' Warsaw can name conditions, Polish minister says on Volyn massacre	Poland can make Ukraine&apos;s accession to the EU contingent on the resolution of the Volyn massacre as joining the bloc is not a matter of the country&apos;s survival, a Polish minister said in a media interview published on Oct. 15. Speaking to the Interia outlet, Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz stressed that Warsaw continues supporting Kyiv through military and humanitarian aid regardless of historical issues. Kosiniak-Kamysz said in June that Ukraine would not enter the EU without resolving the Volyn massacre, a tragic episode in Polish-Ukrainian history in 1943 when members of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) massacred tens of thousands of Poles in Nazi-occupied Volyn, a region that used to be part of Poland and is now part of Ukraine. Thousands of Ukrainians were killed in retaliation. &quot;Joining the EU is not an existential matter for Ukraine; it is an opportunity for development, higher GDP growth,&quot; Kosiniak-Kamysz told Interia. &quot;Together with the conditions set by the EU, we can put forward our ethical and historical conditions regarding Volyn.&quot; Ukraine launched membership talks with the EU earlier this year, but the final decision will require consensus among all 27 members. The matter of the Volyn massacre was raised again by Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski last month, reportedly leading to a tense exchange with President Volodymyr Zelensky. Despite several attempts at reconciliation between modern-day Poland and Ukraine, the remaining tensions relate to Warsaw&apos;s request for the exhumation of massacred Poles buried in modern-day Ukraine. Ukraine blocked the exhumation in 2017 after Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) memorials in Poland were vandalized. In early October, the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance promised to begin searches and exhumations next year. The matter has also sparked tensions inside the Polish leadership. President Andrzej Duda said that blocking Ukraine&apos;s EU accession is in line with &quot;Vladimir Putin&apos;s policy.&quot; Duda made the comment even though objections to Ukraine&apos;s entry over the Volyn issue were also raised by the previous conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government, which was allied with the president. &quot;This may come as a surprise, but this government is taking the issue of exhumation of the Volyn massacre victims and their commemoration much more seriously than the previous government,&quot; Kosiniak-Kamysz claimed in the interview.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-volyn-eu-poland/	2024-10-16T00:48:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2153247705.jpg
US doesn't defend Ukraine with THAAD system like Israel due to 'different capabilities,' Pentagon says	The United States is not deploying a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile battery to protect Ukraine, as it will do in Israel, given the different defense capabilities of the two nations, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said at a briefing on Oct. 15. Following Iran&apos;s recent attack on Israel, Washington authorized the deployment of the THAAD in the country to bolster Israel&apos;s missile defense capabilities. The advanced surface-to-air interceptor is designed to shoot down incoming ballistic missiles. Iran reportedly launched more than 180 missiles at Israel on Oct. 1 amid rising tensions in the Middle East. Russia regularly attacks Ukraine with dozens of Iranian Shahed-type drones and missiles, targeting civilian infrastructure. When asked why the U.S. would not deploy the THAAD system in neighboring Romania or Poland to help defend Ukraine&apos;s west from Russian attacks, Singh cited different commitments to the countries, including a longstanding partnership with Israel. &quot;Different capabilities, different wars, different regions. The commitments also to Israel and Ukraine are different,&quot; she said, adding that &quot;it is a little bit of apples and oranges here.&quot; According to Singh, the Biden administration continues to support both Ukraine and Israel in meeting their different needs. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine&apos;s neighboring NATO countries could help shoot down Russian aerial targets over Ukraine too, but the partners &quot;are not yet ready&quot; for this. &quot;What works in the skies of the Middle East and helps Israel&apos;s defense can work just as well in the skies of our part of Europe &#x2013; in Ukraine &#x2013; helping to save lives,&quot; he said on Oct. 3. Asked in early October why the West could not help Ukraine shoot down Russian missiles as it did during Iran&apos;s recent attack on Israel, Singh said that these are &quot;two very different landscapes and battlefields.&quot; According to the spokesperson, such a move would involve the United States in Moscow&apos;s full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/thaad/	2024-10-16T00:33:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-908835.jpg
Large-scale power outages reported in Ukraine's south	The southern city of Kherson has completely lost electricity for as of yet unknown reasons, Roman Mrochko, the city&apos;s military administration head, said on Oct. 16. &quot;According to preliminary information, the entire city was cut off. The reasons are being determined,&quot; Mrochko said on Telegram. The same morning, power outages were reported in Mykolaiv Oblast, which is neighboring Kherson Oblast. &quot;Many people have lost electricity. We identified the source. There was no strike. We will fix it in a couple of hours if there are no further surprises,&quot; Governor Vitalii Kim said. While the officials did not link the recent outages to Russian strikes, cities and villages across Ukraine have experienced regular blackouts as a result of attacks against the energy grid during the full-scale war. Russia launched over 130 Shahed-type drones against Ukraine overnight on Oct. 16, in addition to missiles and other weaponry. Both Mykolaiv and Kherson oblasts suffered attacks. Kyiv recently warned that Russia is likely to resume its attacks against the power grid in the coming autumn and winter months, mimicking the strategy employed in the autumn-winter season of 2022-2023 and this year&apos;s spring.	https://kyivindependent.com/kherson-mykolaiv-outages/	2024-10-15T23:47:26-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1244832834.jpg
51 of 136 Russian drones downed in mass overnight attack on Ukraine, Air Force says	Ukrainian air defenses downed 51 of the 136 Shahed-type attack drones launched during a Russian attack overnight on Oct. 16, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force said. The drones were reportedly launched from the Russian port town of Primorsko-Akhtarsk, located on the coast of the Sea of Azov, and from Russia&apos;s Kursk and Orel oblasts. Aircraft, missile and electronic warfare units, and mobile fire groups of the Ukrainian Air Force intercepted the drones over 14 oblasts across Ukraine, the Air Force said. According to the Kyiv City Military Administration, air defenses intercepted all drones Russia launched against Ukraine&apos;s capital. Russia attacked an industrial facility in western Ternopil Oblast, causing a large-scale fire that was later put out, Governor Viacheslav Nehoda said. No casualties were reported. Sixty drones were &quot;lost&quot; due to electronic warfare in a number of regions, while 20 more drones were flying over Ukraine at the time of publication, according to the statement. Two more drones flew back toward Russia. Russian forces also attacked Donetsk Oblast with an S-300/400 missile and launched a Kh-59 cruise missile against Chernihiv Oblast. Drone attacks are a daily occurrence in Ukraine, affecting various regions across the country. Russia attacked Ukraine with more than 1,300 such drones in September, launching them on a daily basis for an entire month.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-136-drones-at-ukraine/	2024-10-15T23:12:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2147853376-3.jpg
New level of desperation' — US 'concerned' by reports of North Korean soldiers joining Russia in Ukraine	Washington is &quot;concerned&quot; by recent reports that Pyongyang had sent its soldiers to join Russian occupying forces in Ukraine, White House National Council spokesperson Sean Savett said on Oct. 15. &quot;Such a move would also indicate a new level of desperation for Russia as it continues to suffer significant casualties on the battlefield in its brutal war against Ukraine,&quot; Savett said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently accused North Korea of sending personnel to support Russia and said that Moscow plans to &quot;actually involve&quot; Pyongyang in the war in the coming months. While the Kremlin has denied the reports, there is mounting evidence that the Russian-North-Korean cooperation has reached a new level. A Western diplomat familiar with the matter told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15 Pyongyang has sent 10,000 soldiers to Russia, but it is unclear what kind of soldiers they are. The two countries have deepened military ties during the full-scale war, with Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signing a strategic partnership agreement in June. North Korea has previously supplied Russian forces with artillery shells and ballistic missiles, both extensively deployed against Ukrainian troops and cities. Savett commented that the transfer of soldiers would mark a significant shift in the Russian-North-Korean defense ties.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-north-korea-ukraine/	2024-10-15T22:55:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1154567149.jpg

Governor orders mandatory evacuation from Kupiansk	Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov announced on Oct. 15 that local authorities would conduct mandatory evacuations of residents living in the city of Kupiansk, as well as three adjacent communities, amid ongoing Russian advances in the region. Kupiansk is a crucial strategic city in Kharkiv Oblast that was temporarily occupied by Russian troops in 2022. In recent months, Kupiansk has been under heavy attacks as Russia intensified assault attempts in the area. Russian forces have been considerably more active near Kupiansk over the past months, following Russia&apos;s attempted renewed Kharkiv offensive. &quot;Due to the security situation, a decision has been made to intensify evacuation measures for civilians in the Kupiansk district, including the city of Kupiansk,&quot; Syniehubov said on TV. Syniehubov also said that the village of Borova, another strategic foothold for Ukraine in Kharkiv Oblast, would also be evacuated. &quot;The most difficult situation is in the Kupiansk sector. On the east bank of the Oskil River, which divides the city, we can no longer guarantee the restoration of electricity, heat and water supply due to constant shelling,&quot; Syniehubov said, adding that &quot;repair crews immediately come under Russian fire&quot; when attempting to conduct restoration work. Russia has consistently attacked Ukrainian energy infrastructure in an attempt to test Ukrainians&apos; resolve through another cold winter. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported that Russian had carried out 26 attacks near Kupiansk over the past day. Russia continues to make marginal advances along difference axis of the front lines, capturing communities in Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk oblasts. .	https://kyivindependent.com/governor-orders-mandatory-evacuation-from-kupiansk/	2024-10-15T21:39:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1494781604.jpg
Spain seizes 13 tons of chemicals, including 'possible' chemical weapon precursors, bound for Russia	Spanish police seized a total of 13 tons of prohibited chemicals, including &quot;possible&quot; chemical weapon precursors, bound for Russia on Oct. 15, the national police announced. Four suspects were arrested in relation to the seizure and were charged with smuggling banned goods, as they allegedly attempted to circumvent EU sanctions which prohibit the shipping of dual-use chemicals to Russia. &quot;During the investigation, it was proven that internationally sanctioned chemicals, some of them possible precursors for chemical weapons or nerve agents, had been exported in the past using this company structure,&quot; the national police and tax authority said in a statement, according to Reuters. According to investigators, the unspecified chemicals were found inside a shipping container at Barcelona&apos;s port. To smuggle the chemicals, the accused established a Spanish company that would allegedly ship the sanctioned chemicals to a subsidiary in Moscow through shell companies in Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. &#xA0; A Kyiv Independent investigation from August showed that Russia&apos;s use of gas attacks is rising. In January, 229 cases were recorded compared to 639 in June and 358 in July, according to the Ukrainian military&apos;s Support Forces, a branch of the army responsible for inspecting chemical warfare. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Ukraine has recorded over 4,000 cases of Russian chemical agents used on Ukraine&apos;s front line, including over 3,100 reported cases since December 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/spain-seizes-13-tons-chemicals-including-possible-chemical-weapon-substances-bound-for-russia/	2024-10-15T20:23:59-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/gettyimages-1587259334-612x612.jpg
Trust in Zelensky remains relatively high among Ukrainians, poll suggests	President Volodymyr Zelensky continues to command the trust of nearly six in ten Ukrainians, with support remaining stable in recent months, a poll released by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) found. According to the survey results released on Oct. 14, 59 per cent of Ukrainians polled hold &quot;trust&quot; in Zelensky while 37 per cent distrust the president. Another 3 per cent of poll respondents were unsure. The results are virtually unchanged from another KIIS survey released in May 2024 and down from a high of 64 per cent in February of this year. Levels of trust in Zelensky have continually decreased from his record-high of 90 per cent in May 2022 - just months following the start of the invasion in February 2022. At that time, only seven per cent of respondents said that they did not have trust in the president. The numbers also draw a stark contrast with level of support for the president this time last year with Zelensky receiving the of 76 per cent of respondents in Oct. 2023 - down 18 percentage points since. Zelensky continues to maintain the trust of a majority of respondents from every region of Ukraine - including a regional high of 62 per cent in the central regions of the country, which includes Kyiv. The president also maintains the trust of 51 per cent of respondents in the country&apos;s war-torn eastern regions, although levels of distrust in eastern Ukraine are among the highest in the country with 45 per cent saying they do not have trust in Zelensky. Despite the steadily declining numbers since the start of the war, Zelensky still commands a level of trust not often seen in Western democracies. For comparison, the average approval of U.S. presidents from 1938-2023 is only 53%. Of the three most recent presidents, only Barack Obama received an average approval rating of more than 50%. The KIIS poll was conducted from Sept. 20 to Oct. 3, 2024, and involved 2,004 respondents from all regions of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/trust-in-zelensky-remains-high-among-ukrainians-poll-suggests/	2024-10-15T19:35:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177266154.jpg
Over 80% of young Germans fear war in Europe, poll suggests	Ongoing wars, the worsening effects of climate change, and increasing political polarization are major concerns for young people in Germany, according to the latest Shell Youth Study. The 2024 edition, titled &quot;Pragmatism Between Disillusionment and Embracing Diversity,&quot; surveyed 2,509 adolescents aged 12 to 25 about their views on politics, society, and the environment. In the wake of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, 81% of young respondents expressed concern about the possibility of war in Europe, a sharp rise from 46% in 2019. The fear of poverty also increased, with 67% citing it as a concern, compared to 52% in 2019. The ongoing conflicts, including Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine and the recent Hamas attack on Israel, have shifted perspectives. According to the study, 69% of young people aged 15 to 25 support a strong NATO presence, with only 6% opposed. These opinions show little variation between youths in former East and West Germany. &quot;Young people have realized that world politics is not somewhere out there, it cannot be avoided any longer,&quot; said Mathias Albert, political scientist at the University of Bielefeld and one of the study&#x2019;s authors, Deutsche Welle (DW) reported. Regarding Russia&apos;s aggression, 60% of 15 to 25-year-olds agreed that &quot;Russia attacked Ukraine and must be punished for it,&quot; while only 13% disagreed. However, opinions on military support for Ukraine are divided: 50% want Germany to provide military aid, while 24% reject it, with noticeable differences between East and West Germany.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-80-of-young-germans-fear-war-in-europe-poll-suggests/	2024-10-15T16:06:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1240573488.jpg
European Council's Michel invites Zelensky to present victory plan at EU Summit	European Council President Charles Michel announced on Oct. 15 that he had invited President Volodymyr Zelensky to present his victory plan for defeating Russia at a summit of EU leaders this week. Zelensky has been rallying support from Ukraine&apos;s Western allies as the Russian invasion drags into its third year and Russian forces continue to make gains along Ukraine&apos;s eastern front. At the Brussels meeting, EU leaders from 27 nations will discuss military aid to Kyiv and measures to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure, which Russian attacks have heavily battered. Last week, Zelensky made a whirlwind tour of European capitals, visiting Berlin, London, Paris, and Rome, as Ukraine braces for a challenging third winter at war. His visits followed the postponement of U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s trip to Germany to handle preparations for Hurricane Milton&#x2019;s approach toward Florida. Zelensky is pushing for renewed military and financial support from Europe amid concerns that backing could weaken if former U.S. President Donald Trump wins next month&apos;s election. Meanwhile, Russian forces continue to make gains along Ukraine&apos;s eastern front and target critical energy infrastructure as the winter looms.	https://kyivindependent.com/european-councils-michel-invites-zelensky-to-present-victory-plan-at-eu-summit/	2024-10-15T14:18:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158896695.jpg
Trump declines to say if he’s spoken to Putin since leaving office, media reports	Former President Donald Trump on Oct. 15 declined to confirm if he had spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin since leaving office in 2021 but said, &quot;If I did, it&#x2019;s a smart thing.&quot; Trump had previously denied claims from journalist Bob Woodward&#x2019;s book that he had multiple phone calls with Putin after leaving the White House, calling it &quot;absolutely wrong.&quot; During an interview with Bloomberg at the Chicago Economic Club, he refused to comment directly on the matter, saying: &quot;If I did, it&#x2019;s a smart thing... If I&#x2019;m friendly with people, if I have a relationship with people, that&#x2019;s a good thing, not a bad thing, in terms of a country.&quot; He also reportedly added: &quot;Russia has never had a president that they respect so much.&quot; Earlier, Trump said that during his presidency, he &quot;(got) along very well with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,&quot; implying that the Russian leader often talked about his ambition to control Ukraine. The comments came three weeks before the U.S. presidential election, which can have a profound impact on Washington&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s struggle against Russian aggression. &quot;I get along very well with Putin. I got; I fully understand what&apos;s happening,&quot; the Republican candidate for U.S. presidency said at a town hall event in Oaks, Pennsylvania, regarding Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. &quot;It (Ukraine) was the apple of his eye; he used to talk about it. But I said, &apos;You&apos;re not going in,&apos; and he wasn&apos;t going in.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-declines-to-say-if-hes-spoken-to-putin-since-leaving-office-media-reports/	2024-10-15T12:50:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1066818340.jpg
This is how North Korean troops could be used in Russia’s war in Ukraine	Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine may have reached a new stage this week, with reports that North Korea has moved from supplying Moscow with weapons to sending its own troops. A Western diplomat familiar with the matter told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15 Pyongyang has sent 10,000 soldiers to Russia, but it&#x2019;s unclear what kind of soldiers they are. Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a strategic defense agreement between Moscow and Pyongyang on June 19, further deepening military ties between the two countries. North Korea has already supplied Russia with artillery shells and ballistic missiles, but sending troops would mark a significant geopolitical escalation in their cooperation. But according to experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent, for now at least, it&apos;s a sign of Russian desperation that could have limited effect. &quot;The disclosure that North Korean troops may appear on the front line is a direct consequence of catastrophic Russian casualties,&quot; John Foreman CBE, the U.K.&apos;s former defense attache in Moscow from 2019 to 2022, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Their military effectiveness is questionable and they will be cannon fodder for Ukrainian defenders.&quot; According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the Korean People&apos;s Army (KPA) is the fourth largest in the world in terms of personnel, with 1,280,000 active members and 600,000 in reserve. Only China, India, and the United States have bigger standing armies. North Korea spent 36.32% of its entire gross domestic product on defense in 2023. North Korean society is heavily militarized and all citizens are required to serve &#x2014; reportedly 10 years for men, and eight for women. &quot;National defense is the supreme duty and honor of citizens,&quot; Article 86 of the country&apos;s constitution states. In terms of weaponry, North Korea has a formidable arsenal that has alarmed the international community for decades. The full extent of the country&apos;s nuclear weapons program is not known, but it is believed to have conducted six tests since 2006 and has enough fissile material for 40-50 nuclear missiles.

(Kim Won Jin / AFP via Getty Images)It has also tested intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of carrying nuclear warheads, with a range far enough to strike the U.S. North Korea is also widely believed to have an extensive chemical weapons program. In 2017, Kim Jong Un&apos;s older half-brother, Kim Jong Nam, was assassinated using the nerve agent VX, in a plot widely accepted as being orchestrated by Pyongyang. Experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent said that North Korea&apos;s most exotic and most deadly weaponry is unlikely to play a role in Ukraine, however. &quot;North Korea can provide two things,&quot; said Christoph Bluth, professor of international relations and security at the University of Bradford. &quot;One is cannon fodder, and the other is their vast arsenal of ammunition from the 1950s.&quot; A lot of the latter is already in Ukraine. The Times, citing Western intelligence sources, reported &#xA0;earlier this month that half of all the artillery shells used by Russia in Ukraine are supplied by North Korea. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelesnky&apos;s recent warnings make clear the relationship between Pyongyang and Moscow has now gone beyond just shells and missiles. &quot;This is no longer just about transferring weapons. It is actually about transferring people from North Korea to the occupying military forces,&quot; Zelensky said on Oct. 13. According to Bluth, accurately assessing the effectiveness of North Korean troops is difficult, but their quality is likely to be low. &quot;They spend a lot of time in the army, but the quality of equipment they have and the quality of the training are rather dubious,&quot; he said. Then, there is the lure of escaping the authoritarian North Korean regime. According to an Oct. 15 report by Ukrainska Pravda citing Ukraine&#x2019;s intelligence services, 18 have already deserted their positions. &quot;So not only may they be poor soldiers, they may take the opportunity to desert if the opportunity presents itself,&quot; Foreman said. People watch a television show North Korea&apos;s 75th anniversary of the founding of the armed forces day military parade released by Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea on on Feb. 9, 2023. (Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images)What will they be used for?According to two sources, it&apos;s likely that after training, North Korean troops will initially be deployed to Kursk Oblast to defend against Ukraine&apos;s ongoing incursion launched more than two months ago. The BBC&apos;s James Waterhouse, citing a Ukrainian military source, said Russia &quot;is forming a unit of approximately 3,000 North Korean citizens close to its border with Mongolia in Ulan-Ude&quot; to be deployed in Kursk Oblast. In a post on Telegram, Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, added that it can&apos;t be ruled out that they are later stationed in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine. &quot;Manpower is the one thing North Korea has that Russia desperately needs,&quot; Bluth said. He adds that while Russia&apos;s disregard for soldiers and its willingness to throw men into &quot;meat assaults&quot; is well documented, in North Korea, the leadership has even less regard for human lives. &quot;Kim Jong Un had his own uncle executed. So he is basically killing as many people as necessary to stay in power,&quot; he said. &quot;Life for North Korean conscripts is brutal and harsh, even without a war, and the consequences for refusing to fight would be extremely dire.&quot; In a press briefing on June 25, Pentagon spokesperson Pat Ryder said North Korean troops would become &quot;cannon fodder&quot; if they joined Russian forces on the battlefield in Ukraine. But in order to make any difference on the battlefield, they would have to be present in far larger numbers than what has so far been reported. According to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, Russia is losing more than 1,000 men per day, meaning 10,000 North Korean troops would only plug a gap for a week or so. Foreman says he doesn&apos;t expect the numbers of North Korean troops currently being reported to &quot;shift the dial dramatically&quot; in Russia&apos;s favor. &quot;It&#x2019;s a clear indicator of how far Russia and its military have fallen over the last two and a half years that it&#x2019;s having to beg, borrow, and buy support from North Korea,&quot; he said. But Dr. Jenny Mathers, Senior Lecturer in International Politics at Aberystwyth University, warns that it could well be just the beginning of North Korea sending troops to Ukraine.

(Gavriil Grigorov / POOL / AFP)&quot;This could just be step one &#x2014; let&apos;s send a small number, see how it works on both sides,&quot; she said. &quot;Can the Russians integrate them, can they find uses for them, overcome language barriers and logistical issues? Can they manage with this relatively small number, and if they can, maybe they&apos;ll scale it up.&quot; Already isolated on the international stage, North Korea has little to lose from joining the war against Ukraine and further angering Kyiv&apos;s Western allies but a lot to gain from deepening relations with Russia. &quot;Russia is on the U.N. Security Council and has been vetoing any resolutions related to human rights or weapons of mass destruction in North Korea,&quot; Bluth points out. &quot;North Korea is basically isolating itself from any path to some sort of relaxation of the tensions with the U.S. or South Korea, so at the moment, North Korea is throwing in its lot with Russia.&quot; Then there are the military benefits. In exchange for ammunition already supplied, Russia reportedly provided North Korea with technology to help it deploy spy satellites as well as tanks and aircraft. Bluth said the deployment of troops could strengthen Pyongyang&apos;s hand in obtaining more military technology from Moscow, particularly missile guidance technology. On Oct. 15, White House National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said the U.S. was &quot;concerned&quot; about reports of North Korean troops in Ukraine, but added: &quot;Such a move would also indicate a new level of desperation for Russia as it continues to suffer significant casualties on the battlefield in its brutal war against Ukraine.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/this-is-how-north-korean-troops-could-be-used-in-russias-war-in-ukraine/	2024-10-15T12:08:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1734340818.jpg
Ukraine war latest: North Korea has sent 10,000 soldiers to Russia, Western source says	Key developments on Oct. 15: North Korea has sent 10,000 soldiers to Russia to boost its war efforts against Ukraine, a Western diplomat familiar with the matter told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15. Concerns over the deepening military ties between Moscow and Pyongyang have escalated dramatically this week. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 13 that Russia&apos;s plans for supporting its full-scale invasion of Ukraine would this autumn include &quot;the actual involvement of North Korea in the war.&quot; The Western diplomat told the Kyiv Independent that it&apos;s unclear what kind of soldiers they are or what their roles were. The Kyiv Independent contacted Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry but did not receive a reply at the time of publication. Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence (HUR) declined to comment. As Russia and North Korea deepen military ties, Western diplomats and experts stress that it shows Moscow&apos;s increasing need for resources to continue waging its costly war in Ukraine. &quot;It&apos;s a clear indicator how far Russia and its military have fallen over the last 2.5 years that it&#x2019;s having to beg, borrow and buy support from North Korea,&quot; John Foreman CBE, the U.K.&apos;s former defense attache in Moscow from 2019 to 2022, told the Kyiv Independent. Earlier this year, the two countries signed a mutual defense pact during Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s visit to Pyongyang. As part of the alliance, the North Korean military announced that an engineering unit would join Russian forces on the ground in Donetsk Oblast the following month. No picture or video evidence has emerged to date that this went ahead. Putin submitted the treaty, which stipulates that either nation must render military assistance to the other in the event of an attack, to the Russian State Duma for ratification on Oct. 14. Zelensky warned on Oct. 13 that Russia and North Korea were deepening their alliance, saying that the partnership had escalated to the point where North Korea was sending personnel to Ukraine&apos;s front lines along with weapons. &quot;This is no longer just about transferring weapons. It is actually about transferring people from North Korea to the occupying military forces,&quot; he said. The warning followed reports from South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-Hyun that North Korea is likely to deploy regular troops to Ukraine to aid Russia at the front. Reports have also emerged in recent days that North Korean officers were killed in a Ukrainian missile strike in Russian-occupied territory. The Kyiv Independent has not been able to verify these reports, which have not been confirmed beyond a single intelligence source. Ukrainian and U.S. officials claim that North Korea has been supplying Russia with ballistic missiles and vast quantities of artillery shells since the fall of 2023. Ukraine is preparing for mass Russian attacks against energy infrastructure during autumn and winter months, Interfax Ukraine reported on Oct. 15, citing comments from National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksandr Lytvynenko. &quot;With the start of the &apos;heating season,&apos; we can expect massive Russian strikes on the energy sector,&quot; Lytvynenko said. The &quot;heating season&quot; refers to the colder period of the year, usually starting in mid-October and lasting until April. Russia carried out a massive campaign of aerial attacks against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure over the spring, similar to the one launched during the fall and winter of 2022-23. The damage caused a serious energy deficit and necessitated rolling blackouts across the country. Speaking at the Energy in Industry 2024 exhibition in Kyiv, officials said the Ukrainian energy sector had shown its ability to implement innovative solutions during the war and that Russia failed to destroy Ukraine&apos;s economy. Ukrainian officials have warned that Moscow is preparing to carry out strikes against Ukrainian nuclear facilities ahead of the winter months as it seeks to plunge the country into a deep freeze aimed at breaking Ukrainians&apos; resolve. Between March and August of this year, Russia also destroyed all thermal power plants and almost all hydroelectric capacity in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in late September. According to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter as a result of the attacks, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand. There are no intact buildings or shelters left in Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast, allowing Russia to occupy new areas of the embattled town, Anastasia Bobovnikova, a spokesperson of the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, said on Oct. 14. Toretsk lies some 35 kilometers (20 miles) north of occupied Donetsk. The town has become one of the hottest spots in Donetsk Oblast in recent months as Russian troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. &quot;Now the town looks more like a desert planet: there are no shelters for civilians or soldiers, and unfortunately, this allows the enemy to occupy new areas, but on scorched earth,&quot; Bobovnikova said. The crowdsourced monitoring website DeepState reported on Oct. 15 that Russian troops have advanced in Toretsk over the past day. Speaking on national television, Bobovnikova said that Russian soldiers change their military uniforms for civilian clothes to move toward Ukrainian positions, a tactic they use in other embattled settlements as well. According to local authorities, Kyiv controlled roughly 40-50% of the town as of Oct. 11, while Russia had captured the rest. Previously, the Ukrainian military said that fighting was taking place &quot;at every building entrance&quot; as Russian forces were pushing from the east along the main Tsentralna (Central) Street. The loss of Toretsk would be another blow to Ukraine in Donetsk Oblast after its forces were forced to withdraw from Vuhledar in the south. Russian forces also continue pushing toward Kurakhove and Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub roughly 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Toretsk. U.S. lawmakers from the Democratic and Republican parties are pressuring President Volodymyr Zelensky to further lower the age of mandatory military conscription, said Presidential Office advisor Serhii Leshchenko on Oct. 15. Ukraine&apos;s parliament adopted an updated mobilization law in mid-April to ramp up mobilization amid Russia&apos;s ongoing war. The new law simplifies the process for identifying eligible conscripts and includes additional penalties for those dodging the draft. Another law, signed by the president just before the mobilization law was passed, lowered the minimum age of compulsory military service from 27 to 25. Leshchenko said that U.S. lawmakers have been pressuring Zelensky and continuing to ask why men aged 18-25 are not being mobilized. &quot;(The) Americans are hinting, Western weapons alone are not enough, we need mobilization from the age of 18.&quot; The unnamed U.S. lawmakers have reportedly cited America&apos;s experience in the Vietnam War, when men aged 18-26 were drafted to fight. Some 2.2 million U.S. soldiers were conscripted to fight in the war through the selective service process. Leshchenko said that Zelensky has thus far refused to budge on changing the conscription age, and has instead continued to press for the delivery of more U.S. military aid. After the new law on mobilization came into force in Ukraine on May 18, military-aged men were given 60 days to update their personal data so that the state could locate them. The deadline for updating data expired on July 17, 2024. From May 18 to July 16, 4,690,496 military-aged men updated their data by the July 17 deadline, according to the Defense Ministry. Russian attacks against Ukraine killed five people and injured at least 34 others over the past day, regional authorities said on the morning of Oct. 15. Ukrainian forces downed 12 out of 17 Shahed-type drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Four more drones were &quot;lost,&quot; it added. Russia also fired seven S-300/400 missiles against Mykolaiv Oblast and two Kh-59 missiles on Chernihiv Oblast overnight, the statement read. A Russian missile strike on the city of Mykolaiv killed a woman and injured at least 23 people, according to Governor Vitalii Kim. The attack damaged an industrial facility, a restaurant complex, shops, residential buildings, and cars. Three people were injured in the village of Shakhtarske in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Two more people suffered injuries in the villages of Zakitne and Riznykivka in the region. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 22 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Four people were killed, and six were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-north-korea-has-sent-10-000-soldiers-to-russia-western-source-says/	2024-10-15T11:44:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029632286.jpg
18 North Korean soldiers already deserted positions by Ukraine's border, intelligence sources tell Suspilne	An estimated 18 North Korean soldiers have deserted from their positions in Russia&apos;s Kursk and Bryansk oblasts near the Ukrainian border, Suspilne reported on Oct. 15, citing unnamed intelligence officials. Concerns over the deepening military ties between Moscow and Pyongyang have escalated dramatically this week. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 13 that Russia&apos;s plans for supporting its full-scale invasion of Ukraine would this autumn include &quot;the actual involvement of North Korea in the war.&quot; A Western diplomat told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15 that North Korea has sent 10,000 soldiers to Russia to boost its war efforts against Ukraine. According to Suspilne&apos;s sources, the soldiers deserted around 7 kilometers (4 miles) from the border with Ukraine. The motive behind their desertion has not yet been established, but the sources said that the Russian military is searching for the soldiers. Russian commanders are attempting to conceal the soldiers&apos; desertion from their higher-ups, the sources said. Earlier this year, the two countries signed a mutual defense pact during Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s visit to Pyongyang.

Leshchenko said that U.S. lawmakers have been pressuring Zelensky and continuing to ask why men aged 18-25 are not being mobilized. &#xA0; The unnamed U.S. lawmakers have reportedly cited America&apos;s experience in the Vietnam War, when men aged 18-26 were drafted to fight. Some 2.2 million U.S. soldiers were conscripted to fight in the war through the selective service process. Leshchenko said that Zelensky has thus far refused to budge on changing the conscription age, and has instead continued to press for the delivery of more U.S. military aid. After the new law on mobilization came into force in Ukraine on May 18, military-aged men were given 60 days to update their personal data so that the state could locate them. The deadline for updating data expired on July 17, 2024. From May 18 to July 16, 4,690,496 military-aged men updated their data by the July 17 deadline, according to the Defense Ministry.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-lawmakers-pressuring-zelensky-to-lower-mobilization-presidential-office-advisor-says/	2024-10-15T08:33:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/army-1.jpg
US lawmakers pressuring Zelensky to lower mobilization age to 18, Presidential Office advisor says	U.S. lawmakers from the Democratic and Republican parties are pressuring President Volodymyr Zelensky to further lower the age of mandatory military conscription to 18, said Presidential Office advisor Serhii Leshchenko on Oct. 15. Ukraine&apos;s parliament adopted an updated mobilization law in mid-April to ramp up mobilization amid Russia&apos;s ongoing war. The new law simplifies the process for identifying eligible conscripts and includes additional penalties for those dodging the draft. Another law, signed by the president just before the mobilization law was passed, lowered the minimum age of compulsory military service from 27 to 25. Leshchenko said that U.S. officials feel that the lowered conscription age has not gone far enough and are putting pressure on Zelensky to further decrease it by another seven years. The unnamed U.S. lawmakers have reportedly cited America&apos;s experience in the Vietnam War, when men aged 18-26 were drafted to fight. Some 2.2 million U.S. soldiers were conscripted to fight in the war through the selective service process.

North Korea has sent 10,000 soldiers to Russia, Western source says	North Korea has sent 10,000 soldiers to Russia to boost its war efforts against Ukraine, a Western diplomat familiar with the matter told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 15. Concerns over the deepening military ties between Moscow and Pyongyang have escalated dramatically this week. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 13 that Russia&apos;s plans for supporting its full-scale invasion of Ukraine would this autumn include &quot;the actual involvement of North Korea in the war.&quot; The Western diplomat told the Kyiv Independent that it&#x2019;s unclear what kind of soldiers they are or what their roles were. The Kyiv Independent contacted Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry but did not receive a reply at the time of publication. Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence (HUR) declined to comment. As Russia and North Korea deepen military ties, Western diplomats and experts stress that it shows Moscow&apos;s increasing need for resources to continue waging its costly war in Ukraine. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a clear indicator how far Russia and its military have fallen over the last 2.5 years that it&#x2019;s having to beg, borrow and buy support from North Korea,&#x201D; John Foreman CBE, the U.K.&#x2019;s former defense attache in Moscow from 2019 to 2022, told the Kyiv Independent. Earlier this year, the two countries signed a mutual defense pact during Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s visit to Pyongyang. As part of the alliance, the North Korean military announced that an engineer unit would join Russian forces on the ground in Donetsk Oblast the following month. No picture or video evidence has emerged to date that this went ahead. Putin submitted the treaty, which stipulates that either nation must render military assistance to the other in the event of an attack, to the Russian State Duma for ratification on Oct. 14. Zelensky warned on Oct. 13 that Russia and North Korea were deepening their alliance, saying that the partnership had escalated to the point where North Korea was sending personnel to Ukraine&apos;s front lines along with weapons. &quot;This is no longer just about transferring weapons. It is actually about transferring people from North Korea to the occupying military forces,&quot; he said. The warning followed reports from South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-Hyun that North Korea is likely to deploy regular troops to Ukraine to aid Russia at the front. Reports have also emerged in recent days that North Korean officers were killed in a Ukrainian missile strike in Russian-occupied territory. The Kyiv Independent has not been able to verify these reports, which have not been confirmed beyond a single intelligence source. Ukrainian and U.S. officials claim that North Korea has been supplying Russia with ballistic missiles and vast quantities of artillery shells since fall of 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-has-sent-10-000-soldiers-to-russia-western-source-says/	2024-10-15T08:11:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157765711.jpg
Gaming platform Steam agrees to remove banned content in Russia, censorship agency says	The video game platform Steam has agreed to remove all content banned in Russia from its online store in the country, the Russian state-controlled media outlet Interfax reported on Oct. 15. The move follows a growing crackdown on social media and other online platforms in Russia since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In September, Russia banned the popular messaging service Discord, becoming the latest social media application to be blocked in the country. Steam, which has an online catalog of more than 100,000 games and is used by around 130 million users around the world, including close to 10 million in Russia, agreed to comply with legislation, the federal censorship agency Roskomnadzor told Interfax. It blocked 11 websites and removed 260 &quot;banned materials&quot; from its platform. Roskomnadzor did not specify what materials it had removed. After Roskomnadzor moved to block the Signal messaging app in August 2024 due to alleged &quot;violations of Russian law,&quot; rumors emerged about plans to block WhatsApp as well. Meanwhile, YouTube has begun experiencing massive outages following reports that the Russian government is planning to block the site completely in September.	https://kyivindependent.com/gaming-platform-steam-agrees-to-remove-banned-content-in-russia/	2024-10-15T07:52:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1659833597.jpg
Zelensky unveiling victory plan on Oct. 16: part will be disclosed only to parliamentary leaders, top lawmaker says	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky intends to present his much-debated victory plan during an address to parliament on Oct. 16, with more sensitive details revealed to faction leaders of the legislature, the parliamentary leader of the ruling party told the Kyiv Independent. The Ukrainian leadership has so far revealed only certain points and general outlines of the five-step plan, stopping short of disclosing it in full. Zelensky has already pitched the plan to U.S. President Joe Biden and European leaders in an effort to drum up international support behind what Kyiv calls a path toward a just and lasting peace. However, more details are now set to be revealed to Ukrainian lawmakers and the public. David Arakhamia, the leader of Zelensky&apos;s Servant of the People parliamentary group, said he expects only part of the plan to be fully declassified during the Oct. 16 session. &quot;I think part will be declassified, and the other part will be presented to the leaders of (parliamentary groups),&quot; Arakhamia said in comments to the Kyiv Independent.

(Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP via Getty Images)Once part of the plan is unveiled in the parliament, it will become accessible to the general public, the lawmaker added. According to Arakhamia, the proposal does not require approval by the legislature. Ukrainian political scientist Volodymyr Fesenko said the purpose of the parliament presentation is to inform lawmakers and society in reaction to &quot;public demand. &quot; Top officials have already revealed certain parts of the plan, namely those related to Western military and political support for Kyiv&apos;s struggle against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The key components focus on military, diplomatic, and economic areas, as well as post-war reconstruction. Specific steps include an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO. Ukraine&apos;s cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast also plays a role in creating pressure on Moscow. Presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak told the Wall Street Journal that the proposal encompasses a request for greater numbers of ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles as well as permission to launch them against military targets in Russia, a step that the Western powers have been hesitant to approve. It likely also includes economic assistance and security guarantees for Ukraine and stepping up sanctions and diplomatic pressure against Russia, Fesenko said. Some parts of the plan will not be disclosed to the general public, Zelensky&apos;s chief of staff Andrii Yermak has said. &quot;The purpose of the plan is to strengthen our positions and force Russia to agree to realistic and just peace negotiations,&quot; Fesenko said, adding that the plan would aim to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war and increase the cost of the war for Russia. Western partners have mostly remained tight-lipped about their opinion of the victory plan. While the U.S. State Department said diplomatically that the proposal includes &quot;a number of productive steps,&quot; some partners were &quot;unimpressed&quot; with the plan, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sept. 25. Several Western officials believe it leans too heavily on additional arms supplies and on lifting restrictions on their use and does not bring many new ideas to the table, the outlet wrote. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Fesenko said it&apos;s &quot;too early to make fatal conclusions&quot; about the West&apos;s reaction to the victory plan. He added that there is so far neither a positive response nor a negative one from the West to Ukraine&apos;s requests to receive permission to strike Russia with long-range weapons and to become a NATO member. Zelensky intended to reveal the victory plan to Ukraine&apos;s Western allies at the Ukraine Defence Contact Group meeting at Germany&apos;s Ramstein airbase on Oct. 12, but the gathering was canceled after outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden aborted his overseas travel due to Hurricane Milton at home. While the U.S. president will visit Germany on Oct. 18, no new date for a Ramstein summit has been set. According to Fesenko, the Ramstein meeting would likely not bring any major strategic decisions as &quot;Biden&apos;s indecisiveness has devalued the meaning&quot; of the summits. Time is of the essence for Ukraine, with only three weeks remaining before the U.S. presidential election, where Biden&apos;s Vice President Kamal Harris, as the Democratic Party candidate, is facing off with former president Donald Trump. The result may profoundly impact Washington&apos;s support for Kyiv in the short and long term. There are worries that if Trump, the Republican nominee, returns to the White House, he might scale down his country&apos;s crucial support, forcing Ukraine toward painful concessions. The U.S. pulling out would only aggravate the already grim situation for Ukraine, as Russian forces keep grinding on in the east, and the country, with some 20% of its territory occupied by Russia&apos;s invading forces, braces for more strikes on the energy sector during the upcoming winter. &quot;In October, November, and December, we have a real chance to move things toward peace and lasting stability. The situation on the battlefield creates an opportunity to make this choice &#x2014; the choice for decisive action to end the war no later than in 2025,&quot; Zelensky said at the Ukraine-South East Europe summit last week.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-present-victory-plan-to-ukraines-parliament-on-oct-16/	2024-10-15T06:15:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2162102517.jpg
Finnish FM warns about growing Ukraine fatigue among Western allies	The Western countries are growing tired of their support of Ukraine, Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen warned, calling for stronger resolve in backing Kyiv, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Oct. 15. &quot;It&apos;s real. And increasingly so,&quot; Valtonen said about the Western fatigue, saying that some partners are hoping for a faster resolution. Concerns about the future of Western support grow as the uncertain U.S. election draws near. Republican nominee and ex-President Donald Trump said he wants to &quot;get (the U.S.) out&quot; of the war, sparking fears that Washington, which has spearheaded the pro-Kyiv alliance, might scale down or withdraw its support. According to Finland&apos;s diplomacy chief, the ongoing conflict in the Middle East has also diverted attention and resources from Ukraine. &quot;These two conflicts are, of course, very much linked, but for us Europeans, it would be important to realize that if we allow Russia to win in Ukraine, then essentially we end the credibility of our deterrence,&quot; Valtonen commented. The hostilities in the Middle East only continue to grow in scope as Israel launched strikes against the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon while war continues to rage further south in Gaza. Hezbollah and Hamas, the latter of which launched an attack against Israel last October, are backed by Iran. In turn, Tehran has forged close ties with Russia over the past few years, supplying Moscow with drones and missiles for war against Ukraine. Facing the war&apos;s mounting economic and social pressures and the allies&apos; weakening resolve, President Volodymyr Zelensky has called for a &quot;decisive action&quot; among international partners to end the war by 2025. The president is trying to drum up international support behind his country&apos;s victory plan, which has been presented to Western leaders and will be partially unveiled to the public on Oct. 16.	https://kyivindependent.com/finnish-fm-warns-about-growing-ukraine-fatigue-among-western-allies/	2024-10-15T06:00:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/--------------2024-05-29-165945.png
Trump holds sight lead over Harris in battleground states in early voting, poll shows	Former U.S. President Donald Trump has a slight advantage over Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris among early American voters in battleground states, according to a Harvard CAPS/Harris poll, The Hill reported on Oct. 14. A total of 48% of voters who said they would vote early in so-called swing states supported Trump, while 47% sided with Harris. Another 5% said they went with another choice or had not yet voted. The upcoming U.S. 2024 presidential election can have a profound impact on Washington&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s struggle against Russian aggression. Trump&apos;s views on Ukraine and the war are causing fears that he might scale down or withdraw military support if re-elected this November. Harris, Trump&apos;s opponent in the upcoming vote, has lambasted Trump for his admiration of Russian President Vladimir Putin and other dictators. A total of seven U.S. states &#x2014;Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin &#x2014; are believed to be crucial in the presidential election this year. The elections are scheduled to be held on Nov. 5. The survey showed that among all voters in the key battleground states, Republican nominee Trump is up by 2 points, with 48% support to Harris&apos; 46%. In turn, Harris is ahead of Trump by 8 points among voters who have already voted across the country, with 51% to Trump&apos;s 43%. The survey, conducted from Oct. 11 to 13, used a representative sample of 3,145 registered voters, including 898 from battleground states.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-harris-early-voting/	2024-10-15T05:50:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2171848317.jpg
NATO will do what's necessary for Ukraine to prevail, Secretary General Rutte says	NATO will not back down in the face of Russian threats and maintain its support for Ukraine, Secretary General Mark Rutte said in comments for Reuters published on Oct. 14. &quot;The message (to Russian President Vladimir Putin) is that we will continue, that we will do what&apos;s necessary to make sure that he will not get his way, that Ukraine will prevail,&quot; Rutte said during a joint interview with Reuters and German radio Hessischer Rundfunk on Oct. 13. Despite Rutte&apos;s assurances, there are growing concerns about the future of Western support as the uncertain U.S. election draws near. Republican nominee and ex-President Donald Trump said he wants to &quot;get (the U.S.) out&quot; of the war, sparking fears he might scale down or withdraw support. NATO&apos;s secretary general made the comments during his first visit to the allied mission for Ukraine in Germany&apos;s Wiesbaden. The mission, named NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU), is meant to take over the coordination of Western aid for Kyiv. According to Reuters, the body is widely seen as a way to safeguard assistance in case of Trump&apos;s return. Under U.S. President Joe Biden, Washington has been the leader of the pro-Kyiv coalition, providing by far the greatest volumes of military supplies. &quot;We are NATO. We are a defensive alliance... We are not interested in capturing any part of any other country outside NATO territory,&quot; Rutte commented. &quot;As this democratic alliance, the strongest military alliance in world history, serving 1 billion people, we stand ready to confront any threat. We will never get intimidated by our adversaries.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/rutte-nato-russia-ukraine/	2024-10-15T05:02:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1522782667.jpg
Wave of bomb threats proven false, most came from Russian IP addresses, police say	The police have examined more than 2,000 messages with bomb threats sent out across Ukraine, the National Police said on Oct. 15, launching a full investigation. Hundreds of Ukrainian schools, businesses, embassies, administrative buildings, and media outlets, including the Kyiv Independent, received bomb threats via email on Oct. 14, prompting evacuations of state institutions. Following their examination of the incident, the police said that all threats turned out to be false. The vast majority of messages reportedly came from Russian IP addresses. &quot;Such messages match the style of Russian intelligence services, which are waging a hybrid war against Ukraine, trying to cause mass panic and exhaust state and law enforcement agencies,&quot; the police said on Oct. 15. The threats appeared to be connected to a recent investigation conducted by Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) into Russian security services&apos; sabotage efforts in Ukraine. The sender claimed to represent a &quot;terrorist group&quot; and said that three of RFE/RL&apos;s investigative journalists should consider themselves responsible for the attack. The group&apos;s name matches that of an anti-Ukrainian Telegram channel that disseminates calls to set fire to cars belonging to Ukrainian military personnel. RFE/RL&apos;s investigative project, Schemes, published a report on Oct. 10 documenting how Russian security services recruit Ukrainians, including minors, to burn cars belonging to military personnel and enlistment officials. The journalists who authored the report were those named in the threatening email. &quot;We will not be intimidated and stand behind our reporters who will continue to bring news to Ukrainian audiences without fear or favor,&quot; RFE/RL President Stephen Capus said. Capus pledged to cooperate with authorities in the investigation.	https://kyivindependent.com/bomb-threats-ukraine/	2024-10-15T04:30:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1436365815.jpg
Opinion: The Russian opposition needs to stop blaming Putin and start confronting Russia's violent imperial legacy	&#x201C;What&#x2019;s the point of a world without Russia in it?&#x201D; asked a well-known politician, now a wanted war criminal, back in 2018. A less prominent Russian figure echoed this sentiment in 2024, though less threateningly, when he remarked, &#x201C;The disintegration of Russia would be a catastrophe, not only for our country and people but a tragedy for the world. The first quote belongs to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the second to one of his biggest critics, dissident Illya Yashin. Despite their many disagreements, both appear oblivious to the root cause of Moscow&#x2019;s aggression &#x2013; an empire built on violence and deceit, masquerading as a nation. Neither is willing to confront this foundational lie that anchors their country&#x2019;s politics, culture, and self-conception. Age-old Russian colonialism &#x2013; manifested this century in wars against Ichkeria, Georgia, and Ukraine &#x2013; endures not through any single leader or regime but through a mindset ingrained in the collective psyche. Rooted in centuries of conquest, Moscow reframes aggression as defense, shielding Russian society from confronting its role in sustaining the empire and its violence. Yashin attributed his fears of Russia&#x2019;s collapse to the issue of &quot;loose nukes&quot; &#x2013; a concern well-known to American policymakers. This echoes the famous Chicken Kyiv speech, where U.S. President George H.W. Bush urged Ukrainians to remain in the Soviet Union. While the U.S. was preoccupied with worries about what could go wrong if the Soviet Union ceased to exist, Ukrainians saw this as betrayal. Did Washington truly fail to grasp Russia&#x2019;s brutal imperial history? Was the Holodomor &#x2013; a famine engineered by Moscow to kill millions of Ukrainians and crush their national movement &#x2013; not enough evidence of this? The new icon of the Russian opposition, Yulia Navalnaya, who took up her late husband&#x2019;s mantle, offered starkly different arguments: &#x201C;There are those who advocate for the urgent &#x2018;decolonization&#x2019; of Russia, arguing to split our vast country into smaller, safer states. However, these &#x2018;de-colonizers&#x2019; can&#x2019;t explain why people with shared backgrounds and cultures should be artificially divided.&#x201D; To grasp how absurd, yet offensive, this statement is, one only needs to recall Putin&#x2019;s rationale for the criminal war Moscow is waging on Ukraine. The &#x201C;brotherly people&#x201D; rhetoric has been used by Russia&#x2019;s tyrannical rulers for centuries. How did people in Tatarstan, Dagestan, or the Sakha Republic come to &#x201C;share backgrounds&#x201D; with Muscovites? Because they were all colonized. Unlike other empires, Moscow&#x2019;s didn&#x2019;t rely on racial exclusion. &#x201C;Instead, it was based on the no-less violent &#x2018;idea of sameness,&#x2019; meaning the colonized were forced to surrender their identity and adopt the norms of the colonizer,&#x201D; explained Ukrainian philosopher Volodymyr Yermolenko. Another prominent member of the Russian opposition, Vladimir Kara-Murza, gave an interview to The Guardian and chose to highlight one quote in his recent tweet: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not just the Russian people, in his view, who need to take collective responsibility, but Western leaders too, who &#x2018;for all these years were buying gas from Putin, inviting him to international summits, rolling out red carpets.&#x2019;&#x201D; Zahar Navalny (L), Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny (2L), Russian journalist Maria Pevchikh (C), film producer Odessa Rae (2R), and Dasha Navalnaya (R) attend the 2023 Vanity Fair Oscar party in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., on March 12, 2023. (Cindy Ord/VF23/Getty Images for Vanity Fair)He is undeniably a brave person, and I am convinced that his intentions are genuine. Yet, even the most enlightened thinkers among the self-professed Russian opposition cannot help but try to find someone else to blame for the war crimes committed by Russians in Ukraine, absolving them of responsibility or at least spreading it thin. By portraying the Russian people as passive victims of Putin&#x2019;s regime, opposition figures are paradoxically validating Putinism &#x2013; the latest reincarnation of a Moscow-centric colonial system of subjugation masked as nationalism. Rather than owning up to collective responsibility, the opposition continues to separate the Russian populace from the actions of their state, effectively reinforcing a culture of denial and complicity rather than challenging it. Kara-Murza&#x2019;s common appeal to Western leaders can be summarized as: don&#x2019;t punish the people. Who could argue against it? But the deeper meaning and symbolism matter. If Putin and his clique are to answer for all the wrongs while the 140 million Russians are absolved of their responsibility, how will they learn that apathy enables injustice? And when will they confront Russia&apos;s bloodstained history, let alone atone for it? While many in the West would like to believe that the Russian people are merely victims of state propaganda, the reality is more complicated. Jade McGlynn, in her book &#x201C;Russia&#x2019;s War,&#x201D; argues that &#x201C;Russia&#x2019;s war on Ukraine is popular with large numbers of Russians and acceptable to an even larger number.&#x201D; This complicity cannot be explained solely by fear of the regime. &#x201C;Putin doesn&#x2019;t shape Russian views on foreign policy or Ukraine so much as he articulates them,&#x201D; she explained. McGlynn points out that many Russians accept Moscow&apos;s narrative because the alternative &#x2013; admitting they are complicit in a genocidal war &#x2013; would be too painful. This mass delusion, coupled with the dehumanization of Ukrainians, sets off a vicious cycle permitting widespread support for or ambivalence toward atrocities. I&#x2019;ve encountered two distinct perspectives on the Russian opposition. The first posits that anyone standing up to Putin is on the right side of history and deserves support. The second contends that figures like Yashin, Navalnaya, and Kara-Murza often do more harm than good &#x2013; calling for the lifting of sanctions, promising democracy in Russia (which, to me, seems impossible without decolonization), and condemning Putin while failing to confront the deeper sources of Russian aggression: stripping people of their agency, perpetuating a narrative of grievance, and sustaining the grand lie of Russia&#x2019;s nationhood. I disagree with neither of those views, and both can be true at the same time. Undoubtedly, there are individuals in Russia or in exile who bravely resist Putin&#x2019;s regime, but the term &quot;Russian opposition&quot; warrants scrutiny. &#x201C;Russia&#x201D; is synonymous with imperialism and subjugation, while &#x201C;opposition&#x201D; stands for democracy, freedom, and accountability &#x2013; concepts that are fundamentally incompatible. As long as Russia clings to its imperial ethos, criticism of Putin will merely confront the consequences, not the root cause of wanton violence.

Unlike other empires, Moscow&#x2019;s didn&#x2019;t rely on racial exclusion. &#x201C;Instead, it was based on the no-less violent &#x2018;idea of sameness,&#x2019; meaning the colonized were forced to surrender their identity and adopt the norms of the colonizer,&#x201D; explained Ukrainian philosopher Volodymyr Yermolenko. Another prominent member of the Russian opposition, Vladimir Kara-Murza, gave an interview to The Guardian and chose to highlight one quote in his recent tweet: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not just the Russian people, in his view, who need to take collective responsibility, but Western leaders too, who &#x2018;for all these years were buying gas from Putin, inviting him to international summits, rolling out red carpets.&#x2019;&#x201D; Zahar Navalny (L), Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny (2L), Russian journalist Maria Pevchikh (C), film producer Odessa Rae (2R), and Dasha Navalnaya (R) attend the 2023 Vanity Fair Oscar party in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., on March 12, 2023. (Cindy Ord/VF23/Getty Images for Vanity Fair)He is undeniably a brave person, and I am convinced that his intentions are genuine. Yet, even the most enlightened thinkers among the self-professed Russian opposition cannot help but try to find someone else to blame for the war crimes committed by Russians in Ukraine, absolving them of responsibility or at least spreading it thin. By portraying the Russian people as passive victims of Putin&#x2019;s regime, opposition figures are paradoxically validating Putinism &#x2013; the latest reincarnation of a Moscow-centric colonial system of subjugation masked as nationalism. Rather than owning up to collective responsibility, the opposition continues to separate the Russian populace from the actions of their state, effectively reinforcing a culture of denial and complicity rather than challenging it. Kara-Murza&#x2019;s common appeal to Western leaders can be summarized as: don&#x2019;t punish the people. Who could argue against it? But the deeper meaning and symbolism matter. If Putin and his clique are to answer for all the wrongs while the 140 million Russians are absolved of their responsibility, how will they learn that apathy enables injustice? And when will they confront Russia&apos;s bloodstained history, let alone atone for it? While many in the West would like to believe that the Russian people are merely victims of state propaganda, the reality is more complicated. Jade McGlynn, in her book &#x201C;Russia&#x2019;s War,&#x201D; argues that &#x201C;Russia&#x2019;s war on Ukraine is popular with large numbers of Russians and acceptable to an even larger number.&#x201D; This complicity cannot be explained solely by fear of the regime. &#x201C;Putin doesn&#x2019;t shape Russian views on foreign policy or Ukraine so much as he articulates them,&#x201D; she explained. McGlynn points out that many Russians accept Moscow&apos;s narrative because the alternative &#x2013; admitting they are complicit in a genocidal war &#x2013; would be too painful. This mass delusion, coupled with the dehumanization of Ukrainians, sets off a vicious cycle permitting widespread support for or ambivalence toward atrocities. I&#x2019;ve encountered two distinct perspectives on the Russian opposition. The first posits that anyone standing up to Putin is on the right side of history and deserves support. The second contends that figures like Yashin, Navalnaya, and Kara-Murza often do more harm than good &#x2013; calling for the lifting of sanctions, promising democracy in Russia (which, to me, seems impossible without decolonization), and condemning Putin while failing to confront the deeper sources of Russian aggression: stripping people of their agency, perpetuating a narrative of grievance, and sustaining the grand lie of Russia&#x2019;s nationhood. I disagree with neither of those views, and both can be true at the same time. Undoubtedly, there are individuals in Russia or in exile who bravely resist Putin&#x2019;s regime, but the term &quot;Russian opposition&quot; warrants scrutiny. &#x201C;Russia&#x201D; is synonymous with imperialism and subjugation, while &#x201C;opposition&#x201D; stands for democracy, freedom, and accountability &#x2013; concepts that are fundamentally incompatible. As long as Russia clings to its imperial ethos, criticism of Putin will merely confront the consequences, not the root cause of wanton violence.

Hungary wants to increase gas purchases from Russia's Gazprom in 2025	Budapest and Russia&apos;s state-owned gas company Gazprom are in talks on additional purchases next year, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said in an interview with Kremlin-run RIA Novosti published on Oct. 15. The move would likely increase Hungary&apos;s reliance on Russian gas despite the EU&apos;s efforts to wean itself off Russian supplies. &quot;Basically, we will increase the volumes. We have already signed one (agreement) for the last quarter of this year, which covers additional (gas) volumes at a price that ensures competitive prices,&quot; Szijjarto said. &quot;We are currently negotiating a deal for next year.&quot; This agreement will include greater volumes thanks to the capacity of the Turkish Stream gas pipeline, running from Russia to Europe through the Black Sea, the minister noted. Budapest is broadly seen as the most Moscow-friendly country within the EU and NATO, repeatedly obstructing aid to Kyiv and sanctions against Russia. Szijjarto has also repeatedly visited Russia throughout the full-scale war, a step that his European colleagues avoided. Hungary receives roughly 4.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas on an annual basis under a 15-year deal signed in 2021. Gazprom and Hungary&apos;s MVM energy company signed a memorandum of understanding on increasing gas supplies at a forum in St. Petersburg on Oct. 10. Budapest is also a major buyer of Russian oil, and one of the few countries in the EU granted an exemption to continue buying pipeline oil via the Druzhba pipeline. According to Szijjarto&apos;s comments from June, Russian fossil fuel supplies cover roughly 70-80% of Hungary&apos;s yearly demand. While the EU has reduced dependency on Russian gas, some of it keeps flowing to Europe through pipelines and as LNG, with the sales profits feeding Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Kyiv has said it will not extend the deal allowing the gas transit to the EU through its territory past its December 2024 expiration date. Europe and Ukraine are in talks with Azerbaijan about alternative gas supplies.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-wants-to-increase-gazprom-gas-purchases-in-2025/	2024-10-15T04:10:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2155704049.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 5, injure at least 34 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed five people and injured at least 34 others over the past day, regional authorities said on the morning of Oct. 15. Ukrainian forces downed 12 out of 17 Shahed-type drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Four more drones were &quot;lost,&quot; it added. Russia also fired seven S-300/400 missiles against Mykolaiv Oblast and two Kh-59 missiles on Chernihiv Oblast overnight, the statement read. A Russian missile strike on the city of Mykolaiv killed a woman and injured at least 23 people, according to Governor Vitalii Kim. The attack damaged an industrial facility, a restaurant complex, shops, residential buildings, and cars. The aftermath of a Russian attack on the city of Mykolaiv overnight on Oct. 15, 2024. (State Emergency Service)Three people were injured in the village of Shakhtarske in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Two more people suffered injuries in the villages of Zakitne and Riznykivka in the region. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 22 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Four people were killed, and six were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine/	2024-10-15T03:38:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-15_08-04-22.jpg
Russia may resume strikes on Ukraine's energy sector in autumn, winter, official warns	Ukraine is preparing for mass Russian attacks against energy infrastructure during autumn and winter months, National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksandr Lytvynenko said on Oct. 15, Interfax Ukraine reported. &quot;With the start of the &apos;heating season,&apos; we can expect massive Russian strikes on the energy sector,&quot; Lytvynenko said. The &quot;heating season&quot; refers to the colder period of the year, usually starting in mid-October and lasting until April. Russia carried out a massive campaign of aerial attacks against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure over the spring, similar to the one launched during the fall and winter of 2022-23. The damage caused a serious energy deficit and necessitated rolling blackouts across the country. Speaking at the Energy in Industry 2024 exhibition in Kyiv, officials said the Ukrainian energy sector had shown its ability to implement innovative solutions during the war, and that Russia failed to destroy Ukraine&apos;s economy. Ukrainian officials have warned that Moscow is preparing to carry out strikes against Ukrainian nuclear facilities ahead of the winter months as it seeks to plunge the country into a lasting cold aimed at breaking Ukrainians&apos; resolve. Between March and August of this year, Russia also destroyed all thermal power plants and almost all hydroelectric capacity in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in late September. According to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter as a result of the attacks, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-strikes-autumn-winter/	2024-10-15T02:45:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2154248575.jpg
Zelensky's advisor responds to allegations of pressure on Ukrainska Pravda, calls it 'incorrect story'	Ukraine&apos;s presidential adviser, Dmytro Lytvyn, called Ukrainska Pravda&apos;s allegations of pressure from the Presidential Office &quot;an incorrect story&quot; in an interview with Liga.net published on Oct. 15. Lytvyn&apos;s reaction came after almost a week of silence after Ukrainska Pravda, one of Ukraine&apos;s leading newspapers, claimed that the Ukrainian government is exerting &quot;systematic pressure&quot; against the outlet. In a statement published on Oct. 9, the newspaper said that officials are being ordered not to communicate with Ukrainska Pravda journalists, who are also being denied access to official events. The outlet further claimed that businesses are being pressured to cease advertising on the outlet&apos;s website and not sponsor the events Ukrainska Pravda organizes. In a follow-up article published the next day, Ukrainska Pravda said, without disclosing its sources, that one of the leading figures of this campaign is Lytvyn, who has been President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s speechwriter and was appointed his advisor in September. When asked about the allegations, Lytvyn said that he did not have his own version of events. &quot;It is impossible to make any effective refutation in this story. When you say that you are not doing something, who will believe it? If so many people say the opposite,&quot; Lytvyn said. &quot;This story is very incorrect. They say something abstract, and you have to refute it as if it were something concrete,&quot; he added. Lytvyn claimed that Ukrainska Pravda had never asked him for comment or questions in almost three years. In a comment to Liga.net, Ukrainska Pravda journalist Roman Romaniuk said the publication had sent a request to the Presidential Office regarding a heated interaction between their journalist Roman Kravets and Zelensky during a recent press conference. Since this request was ignored, Ukrainska Pravda did not reach out to the Presidential Office again before publishing the article about government pressure, said Romaniuk, the author of the piece. Ukraine&apos;s independent media has taken great strides since the EuroMaidan Revolution in 2014, but concerns have been raised since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. &#x200B;&#x200B;Reporters Without Borders (RSF) indicated in June the &quot;shrinking&quot; of press freedom in Ukraine, highlighting a &quot;worrying decline&quot; in support and respect for media autonomy and increased pressure from the state or other political actors inside Ukraine. The statement came one month after the annual press freedom index published by RSF showed Ukraine rising compared to last year. As the Kyiv Independent reported in July, media still face different forms of pressure from authorities, according to Ukrainian editors and press freedom watchdogs, months after attacks on investigative journalists provoked a public outcry and condemnation. &quot;We have often encountered pressure in our work. But the last time we faced such economic restrictions was during the presidency of (Leonid) Kuchma,&quot; Sevgil Musayeva, editor-in-chief of Ukrainska Pravda, told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 9, referring to Ukraine&apos;s president from 1994-2005. Since being founded in 2000, two journalists from Ukrainska Pravda have been killed &#x2014; co-founder Georgiy Gongadze, and top editor Pavel Sheremet. Gongadze, who was critical of then-President Kuchma, was kidnapped on Sept. 16, 2000. Two months later, his headless body was found in a forest some 70 kilometers outside Kyiv. &#x200B;&#x200B;Belarusian-born Sheremet was blown up in his car in central Kyiv on July 20, 2016. Musayeva stressed the importance of making public the pressure Ukrainska Pravda is facing and called on international audiences to take note. &quot;Ukraine must remain a democracy, and freedom of speech is one of the most important values in a free society,&quot; she said.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelenskys-advisor-responds-to-accusations-of-pressure-on-ukrainska-pravda/	2024-10-15T01:45:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-15-111949.png
Kyiv denies media reports about supplying drones to Mali rebels	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry on Oct. 14 rejected &quot;accusations spread by some international media&quot; about Kyiv&apos;s involvement in drone supplies for Malian rebels. The statement comes after an article by the French outlet Le Monde claimed that Tuareg fighters from the anti-government CSP movement are using Ukrainian drones against the government forces and their Wagner allies. According to Le Monde&apos;s report, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) has been cooperating with Malian rebels since early 2024. Citing a source close to HUR, the outlet also wrote that Ukrainian specialists arrived in the Sahel region to train the rebels, and some CSP members received training in Ukraine. In July, Russian Wagner mercenaries and Malian soldiers reportedly suffered heavy losses in an engagement with Tuareg rebels. The Russian mercenary group, known for its deployment in Ukraine and short-lived rebellion against the Kremlin last year, has a strong presence across the African continent, backing Russian business interests and Moscow-friendly regimes. After the rebel victory became public, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence spokesperson, Andrii Yusov, said that the rebels were receiving &quot;useful information, and not just that, which allowed them to carry out a successful military operation against Russian war criminals.&quot; This was understood by the Malian government as an admission of Ukraine&apos;s support for the rebels, after which it broke off diplomatic relations with Kyiv. Neighboring Niger soon followed suit. &quot;We also categorically deny all the regular accusations made by the high-ranking officials of the Republic of Mali and the Republic of Niger that Ukraine is allegedly involved in &apos;cooperation with terrorists,&apos; &apos;arms supplies and providing them with information,&apos; &apos;support to the terrorist coalition,&apos; etc.,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry said in its Oct. 14 statement. Kyiv denied claims by Niger and Mali already in August, saying that the steps of the two African countries were made under Russian influence. The ministry also denied accusations about supplying weapons and equipment provided by Kyiv&apos;s partners as assistance against Russian aggression. &quot;From the first months of the Russian full-scale invasion, it was Ukraine that first initiated the introduction of an extensive system of monitoring and control over the weapons supplied to our state by Western partners,&quot; the ministry said. &quot;Once again, we emphasize that Ukraine remains committed to the further development of mutually beneficial relations with all African states,&quot; the statement read.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-denies-media-reports-about-supplying-drones-to-mali-rebels/	2024-10-15T01:05:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2157390795.jpg
No intact buildings left' in Toretsk, accelerating Russian advance, military says	There are no intact buildings or shelters left in Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast, allowing Russia to occupy new areas of the embattled town, Anastasia Bobovnikova, a spokesperson of the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, said on Oct. 14. Toretsk lies some 35 kilometers (20 miles) north of occupied Donetsk. The town has become one of the hottest spots in Donetsk Oblast in recent months as Russian troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. &quot;Now the town looks more like a desert planet: there are no shelters for civilians or soldiers, and unfortunately, this allows the enemy to occupy new areas, but on scorched earth,&quot; Bobovnikova said. The crowdsourced monitoring website DeepState reported on Oct. 15 that Russian troops have advanced in Toretsk over the past day. The estimated advance of Russian forces in Toretsk as of Oct. 14, 2024, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Speaking on national television, Bobovnikova said that Russian soldiers change their military uniforms for civilian clothes to move toward Ukrainian positions, a tactic they use in other embattled settlements as well. According to local authorities, Kyiv controlled roughly 40-50% of the town as of Oct. 11 while the rest has been captured by Russia. Previously, the Ukrainian military said that fights were taking place &quot;at every building entrance&quot; as Russian forces were pushing from the east along the main Tsentralna (Central) Street. The loss of Toretsk would be another blow to Ukraine in Donetsk Oblast after its forces were forced to withdraw from Vuhledar in the south. Russian forces also continue pushing toward Kurakhove and Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub roughly 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Toretsk.	https://kyivindependent.com/toretsk-destruction/	2024-10-14T23:30:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2162608183.jpg
Trump implies Putin told him about his designs for Ukraine	Donald Trump said on Oct. 14 that during his presidency, he &quot;(got) along very well with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,&quot; implying that the Russian leader often talked about his ambition to control Ukraine. The comments came three weeks before the U.S. presidential election, which can have a profound impact on Washington&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s struggle against Russian aggression. &quot;I get along very well with Putin. I got; I fully understand what&apos;s happening,&quot; the Republican candidate for U.S. presidency said at a town hall event in Oaks, Pennsylvania, regarding Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. &quot;It (Ukraine) was the apple of his eye; he used to talk about it. But I said, &apos;You&apos;re not going in,&apos; and he wasn&apos;t going in.&quot; The former president repeated his assertion that there &quot;wouldn&apos;t be a war between Russia and Ukraine&quot; if he had been in the White House instead of Joe Biden in the past years. Russia&apos;s aggression against Ukraine began in 2014 with the occupation of Crimea and invasion of Donbas, with hostilities ongoing throughout Trump&apos;s presidential term of 2017-2021. Speaking at the event, Trump also claimed he &quot;(gets) along very well with (Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr) Zelensky,&quot; highlighting their meeting in New York during the Ukrainian president&apos;s visit to the U.S. During their meeting in late September, Trump again praised his relationship with both Zelensky and Putin. Zelensky also met with President Biden and Trump&apos;s rival in the upcoming vote, Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump&apos;s boasting about good ties with Putin has contributed to the concerns about his future policy toward Ukraine should he become president. Excerpts from U.S. journalist Bob Woodward&apos;s new book, &quot;War,&quot; claim that Trump has spoken to Putin seven times since leaving office in 2021 and secretly sent the Russian president Covid testing devices during his presidency. Trump has often claimed he would end Russia&apos;s war within &quot;24 hours&quot; without elaborating on how he plans to achieve it. Some reports and statements from Trump&apos;s inner circle indicate this might entail pressuring Ukraine to cede territory or give up on its NATO aspirations.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-putin-ukraine/	2024-10-14T23:15:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178454704.jpg

According to the report, Russia has also lost 8,988 tanks, 17,939 armored fighting vehicles, 26,654 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,430 artillery systems, 1,231 multiple launch rocket systems, 978 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 17,019 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-671-400-troops-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-14T22:23:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2003918251.jpeg
Russian missile attack on Mykolaiv kills 1, injures 16	A Russian missile attack against the southern city of Mykolaiv overnight on Oct. 15 killed a woman and injured 16 other people, Governor Vitalii Kim reported. Russian forces struck the city with S-300 anti-aircraft missiles at around 2:30 a.m. An industrial facility, a restaurant complex, shops, residential buildings, and cars were damaged, according to the governor. Three victims were treated on an outpatient basis.

Ukrainians in occupied territories to lose free medication without Russian passports	Starting in 2025, Ukrainians with diabetes, bronchial asthma, and other illnesses in Russian-occupied territories will lose access to free medications unless they acquire Russian passports, according to the Eastern Human Rights Group. This practice has already been enforced in Starobilsk, Luhansk Oblast, where residents without Russian citizenship are denied medical services and medications under social programs. Patients must also be registered and included in a specific registry to receive this aid, the human rights group wrote on Facebook. The move further pressures Ukrainians in occupied areas to accept Russian citizenship or face severe health consequences. Ukraine&apos;s National Resistance Center condemned this policy as an act of genocide aimed at erasing the Ukrainian identity. Russia systematically coerces residents of the occupied parts of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts to accept Russian passports, the U.S. research group Ukraine Conflict Observatory reported on Aug. 2. On July 21, the National Resistance Center said that Russian occupation authorities in some parts of Kherson Oblast force the residents to accept Russian passports under the threat of deportation. In other cases, those who hold on to their Ukrainian passports reportedly face losing their property rights, prison sentences, and mobilization into the Russian army. According to the Ukraine Conflict Observatory, Russia&apos;s methods constitute a serious violation of international law, as the Hague Convention of 1907 forbids to &quot;compel the inhabitants of occupied territory to swear allegiance to the hostile Power.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-in-occupied-territories-to-lose-free-medication-without-russian-passports/	2024-10-14T21:53:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1242332025.jpg
Pro-Kremlin lawmaker from Fico's party visits Moscow, apologizes for EU policies	Lubos Blaha, a senior lawmaker from Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico&apos;s pro-Russian Smer (Direction) party, visited Moscow on Oct. 12. Blaha posted a four-minute Telegram video, walking across the Red Square, praising Russia as &quot;beautiful, wise, and advanced,&#x201D; and calling for an end to hatred towards the country. He stated that he travelled to Russia in order to &quot;give thanks for the liberation from fascism&quot; and apologize for Western &quot;Russophobia.&quot; Blaha then paid tribute to Soviet commander Georgy Zhukov and commented on the &quot;Slavic brotherhood&quot; between Slovakia and Russia, repeating common Kremlin propaganda points used to justify the invasion of Ukraine. He also criticized the European Parliament&#x2019;s resolutions against Russia, and said that he opposes further military aid to Ukraine as well as Western sanctions against Russia, echoing Fico&#x2019;s stance. Fico halted military aid to Ukraine after taking office in September 2023. The move was a stark reversal of Slovak foreign policy. Following Fico&#x2019;s rise to power, Slovakia embarked on a path very similar to its southern neighbor Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban&#x2019;s Russia-friendly leadership has been a consistent thorn in the side of EU and NATO unity regarding Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/pro-kremlin-lawmaker-from-ficos-party-visits-moscow-apologizes-for-eu-policies/	2024-10-14T20:39:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/blaha--1-.jpg
EU mission to train military in Ukraine to be extended by two years, Borrell says	On Oct. 14, EU foreign ministers discussed extending the European Union Military Assistance Mission (EUMAM), which trains Ukrainian military forces. Josep Borrell, the European Union&#x2019;s top diplomat, emphasized the immense pressure on Ukraine&apos;s military, stating that &quot;we must provide them with more capabilities and strengthen our training mission.&quot; He confirmed plans to extend the EUMAM mandate for another two years, pending approval from the EU Council. EUMAM, established in 2022, conducts training primarily in Poland and Germany. Borrell promised to visit Ukraine once a final decision is made. He also mentioned progress in unblocking frozen European Peace Facility funds, which reimburse EU countries for military aid to Ukraine. Hungary, broadly seen as the most Kremlin-proximate EU member, has repeatedly obstructed aid for Ukraine on account that it &quot;prolongs&quot; and &quot;escalates&quot; the ongoing war. These views have been often echoed in Slovakia since Ukraine-skeptic Prime Minister Robert Fico took office last fall. A proposed reform of the European Peace Facility (EPF) would make financial contributions voluntary, aiming to bypass Hungary&apos;s veto on military aid to Ukraine, which has caused a 6.5 billion euro ($7 billion) backlog.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-mission-to-train-military-in-ukraine-to-be-extended-by-two-years-borrell-says/	2024-10-14T18:31:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1984862021.jpeg
Threatening emails sent to Ukrainian organizations after media investigation into Russian security services	Hundreds of Ukrainian schools, businesses, embassies, and media outlets, including the Kyiv Independent, received bomb threats via email on Oct. 14, prompting evacuations of state institutions. The threats appeared to be connected to a recent investigation conducted by Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) into Russian security services&apos; sabotage efforts in Ukraine. &quot;I have planted several explosive devices in your building, and very soon it will explode,&quot; the email received by the Kyiv Independent said. The email, while otherwise vague as to &quot;your building,&quot; did list some other addresses as targets, including the RFE/RL office and the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. The threats lead authorities to carry out searches for explosives at a number of organizations, RFE/RL reported. The police did not find any evidence of an explosive device at the outlet&apos;s office in Kyiv. The sender claimed to represent a &quot;terrorist group&quot; and said that three of RFE/RL&apos;s investigative journalists should consider themselves responsible for the attack. The group&apos;s name matches that of an anti-Ukrainian Telegram channel that disseminates calls to set fire to cars belonging to Ukrainian military personnel. RFE/RL&apos;s investigative project, Schemes, published a report on Oct. 10 documenting how Russian security services recruit Ukrainians, including minors, to burn cars belonging to military personnel and conscription center representatives.

Brazil must arrest Putin if he attends G20, Ukraine's Prosecutor General says	Brazil is obligated to arrest Russian President Vladimir Putin if he attends the Group of 20 nations (G20) summit in Rio de Janeiro next month, Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General Andrii Kostin told Reuters in an interview published Oct. 14. The International Criminal Court (ICC) in March 2023 issued a warrant for Putin&apos;s arrest due to his role in the deportation of Ukrainian children. Brazil is a party to the ICC&apos;s Rome Statute and therefore required to detain Putin if he enters the country. Intelligence reports indicate that Putin may attend the upcoming summit, Kostin told Reuters. &quot;(I)t&apos;s important for the international community to stand united and hold Putin accountable,&quot; Kostin said. Brazil issued a standard invitation to Putin for the summit, which will convene heads of state of G20 nations in Rio de Janeiro Nov. 18-19. There has been no indication that Putin plans to attend, two Brazilian government officials told Reuters. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Oct. 14 that no decision has been made as to Putin&apos;s attendance at the conference. In light of &quot;information that Putin may attend the G20 summit in Brazil, I would like to reiterate that it&apos;s an obligation for the Brazilian authorities as a state party of the Rome Statute to arrest him if he dares to visit,&quot; Kostin said. &quot;I truly hope that Brazil will arrest him, reaffirming its status as a democracy and a state governed by the rule of law.&quot; Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said in September 2023 that the decision to detain Putin at the G20 would be left to his country&apos;s judiciary. Putin visited Mongolia, an ICC member state, in September of this year, his first such visit since his arrest warrant was made public. Despite Mongolia&apos;s obligation under international law to arrest Putin, the Russian president received a warm welcome in Ulaanbaatar. Ukrainian lawmakers described Putin&apos;s Mongolia visit as &quot;a well-planned provocation&quot; meant to show his indifference to the rule of law.	https://kyivindependent.com/brazil-must-arrest-putin-if-he-attends-g20-ukraines-prosecutor-general-says/	2024-10-14T14:08:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1238531446.jpg
Precarious road to Republican US support of Ukraine runs through evangelicals	In the final weeks of campaigning for the U.S. election, a top focus of Donald Trump has been rebooting a wave of evangelical support that proved crucial to his victorious 2016 presidential campaign. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll tell you another (group) that don&#x2019;t vote, I love these people, evangelical Christians,&#x201D; Trump, the Republican party&#x2019;s presidential candidate, said at a rally on October 6. &#x201C;If (evangelicals) did vote, we couldn&#x2019;t lose an election.&#x201D; However, in the run up to the high-stakes election, where Trump seeks a second term, he isn&apos;t the only one courting evangelicals. The mostly conservative group has for months been a focus of Ukrainian lobbying efforts seeking to expand and cement Republican support for Ukraine. The hope is that by exposing Russia&#x2019;s genocidal war against Ukraine as one that involves Moscow persecuting and killing Christians, including evangelicals, Americans in Trump&#x2019;s MAGA movement &#x2014; specifically the influential religious right &#x2014; could shift their position toward supporting Ukraine. Instead of echoing Trump in questioning American support for Ukraine in its existential fight for survival, efforts underway aim to convert them to a pro-Ukrainian stance &#x2014; reaching out to help Ukraine as the victim, not Russia as the aggressor.

(Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg via Getty Images)&#xA0;Such efforts proved effective in getting House Speaker Mike Johnson, an evangelical himself, to allow Ukraine&apos;s half-year-delayed $61 million aid package to pass in April. But with nearly 80% of evangelicals voting for Trump in 2016 and 2020, and 62% of Republicans saying the U.S. is not responsible for helping Ukraine, long-term backing from Johnson and the influential evangelicals base of Trump&#x2019;s MAGA movement isn&#x2019;t a given come election day on Nov. 5. Johnson made this reality clear on Oct. 11, saying, &quot;I don&apos;t have an appetite for further Ukraine funding, and I hope it&apos;s not necessary.&quot; &quot;If President Trump wins, I believe that he actually can bring that conflict to a close. I really do. I think he&apos;ll call (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and tell him that this is enough,&quot; Johnson added in an interview with Punchbowl News. Mark Sergeyev, a displaced person from Russian-occupied Melitopol in Ukraine&apos;s southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, is one of the many evangelicals brought to the U.S. in recent months. In July, he took a break from volunteering as a chaplain on the front lines to travel to Washington. He carried with him a message for Congress: Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion is a &#x201C;spiritual war&#x201D; against Ukraine and Western civilization. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a fifth-generation evangelical Christian, my parents, they were always evangelical Christians and they&#x2019;ve been persecuted,&#x201D; Sergeyev said in his testimony before lawmakers. &#x201C;Russians are making a weapon of religion, and they are trying to make my father use the role of spiritual leader to praise their invasion,&#x201D; he added, describing what he recalled as a chaotic scene outside his church in early 2022 when Russian soldiers threatened his father if he didn&#x2019;t record a video in front of the church saying Melitopol is Russian territory. From the 2014 Russian killing of Ukrainian Protestants in Slovyansk when Russia launched its first invasion of Ukraine&#x2019;s eastern Donbas region to the destruction of 600 houses of worship in the full-scale invasion&#x2019;s first two and a half years, Sergeyev&#x2019;s testimony has historical undertones. To make his message more relatable for the conservative American lawmakers in the room, Sergeyev referenced the famous televangelist Joel Osteen and his Texas megachurch. &quot;I was born in a free country, my father was a senior pastor of Melitipol Christian Church,&#x201D; Sergeyev said in his testimony. &#x201C;Some American visitors often compare us to Joel Olsteen&apos;s Lakewood Church from Houston &#x2026; we have a big stage, a big worship team.&quot; Following Sergeyev&#x2019;s testimony, Republican Senator from Mississippi Roger Wicker said, &#x201C;Our witnesses today remind us of a tragically overlooked victim of the dictator Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s war on Ukraine, and that&#x2019;s the Ukrainian evangelical community,&#x201D; according to Steven Moore, a Kyiv-based former Republican staffer on the Hill who testified with Sergeyev and spoke with the Kyiv Independent. The U.S.-based nonprofit Defenders of Faith and Religious Freedom in Ukraine took Sergeyev to Washington. The group is one of the many organizations that, along with evangelical leaders and lobbying groups, believe that the road to winning over and sustaining U.S. and Republican Party support for Ukraine is through America&#x2019;s evangelical Christian communities. There are nearly 90 million evangelicals in the U.S., 82% of whom are polled to vote for Trump in November. While their turnout is critical for Trump&#x2019;s election chances, their voting will also help shape which party controls the U.S. legislature and future foreign policy.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)As such, winning over their hearts and minds is key for Kyiv&#x2019;s long-term survival and hopes of victory over Russia. The passage of $61 billion in U.S. aid to Ukraine in April has largely been credited to the multi-pronged evangelical levers pulled to convince Speaker Johnson &#x2014; after reportedly getting approval from Trump himself &#x2014; to stop delaying its approval and swiftly adopt it. Days before the aid bill was adopted, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s chief of staff Andriy Yermak said in an opinion piece published in one of Washington&#x2019;s main newspapers that Ukraine&#x2019;s nearly one million evangelicals are the largest in Europe. In the piece, titled &#x201C;Ukraine&#x2019;s evangelicals need U.S. support,&#x201D; Yermak describes the &#x201C;long history&#x201D; of American-Ukrainian evangelical cooperation, calling on the two sides to come together to &#x201C;ensure religious tolerance in Ukraine.&#x201D; Appealing to evangelicals&apos; Christian values is as much about drumming up support for Ukraine&#x2019;s fight against Russia as it is combatting Kremlin propaganda narratives that have permeated conservative political camps in the U.S. Even without propaganda, the view some Americans have of idolizing Russian values is enough to have to combat. Twenty-four percent of Republican primary voters believe Russia promotes and encourages traditional family values, according to polling done immediately following April&#x2019;s aid package. In Russia, however, religion, like politics, is heavily controlled, with the dominant Russian Orthodox Church serving Kremlin interests. Other faiths are suppressed or contained, including evangelicals. In contrast, religious freedom has typically thrived in Ukraine, where the Orthodox Christian faith is the largest but by no means dominant in a competitive and friendly environment where large portions of the population are also protestant or Catholic. They, along with religious leaders of Muslims and Jews, jointly condemn Russia&#x2019;s invasion and its war crimes. Russia has also used religion to justify its war against Ukraine as needed to &#x201C;de-Nazify&#x201D; the country even though Zelensky is of Jewish roots. Moore, who founded the Ukraine Freedom Project, says he&#x2019;s indirectly fighting a disinformation battle against far-right media star Tucker Carlson and conspiracy theorist congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. &#x201C;Wow, these people are like me,&#x201D; American Christians respond when Moore shows them a video of Russian soldiers interrupting a Ukrainian church service, allowing his message to resonate with American churchgoers. Carlson and Greene, Moore says, are feeding Russian propaganda to the same Republicans he&#x2019;s reaching with his messaging of Ukrainian freedom. The conservative idols are partly responsible for the false claim popular among the right that Ukraine is &#x201C;persecuting Christians,&#x201D; allegedly due to the Ukrainian parliament&#x2019;s Aug. 20 potential banning on the Kremlin-linked Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate and thus, further amplifying conservative opposition for sending U.S. aid to Ukraine. &#x201C;There is no similar country to evangelicals and Catholics than Ukraine, but there&#x2019;s that misinformation out there,&#x201D; Congressman Don Bacon, a Republican from Nebraska told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;I heard it back home, a lady said &#x2018;Why is Ukraine against Evangelicals?&#x201D; This is why Moore says he continuously shuttles between Kyiv and Washington, solely to compile Republican support for Ukraine. However, in an election teetering in the margin of error in polls, every vote counts, which is why the Democratic presidential campaign for Vice President Kamala Harris has an evangelical outreach strategy. One message Moore says gets through to Republicans is the story of Viktor Cherniivaski, a Ukrainian evangelical who says a Russian Orthodox priest watched Russian soldiers torture him. Another is Ukrainian religious freedom being threatened by the &#x201C;evil axis&#x201D; of Russia and its allies in its war against Ukraine which are seen as a threat to Western civilization at large: China, Iran, and North Korea. Putting the war into this context could trigger more conservative buy-in. &#xA0;When Moore says Russia is using the same Iranian drones against Ukraine that Tehran is using against Israel, he gains Republican&#x2019;s attention. Twelve days before the aid package passed on April 24, Speaker Johnson received a letter urging him to pass aid for Ukraine from the Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission (ERLC), the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention. &#x201C;I am writing to share the concerns of our convention in continuing to support the people of Ukraine in their struggles to protect their national sovereignty,&#x201D; the letter read. &#x201C;We support the work of Congress in providing additional support to Ukraine and welcome Congress to take action to prevent further loss of life.&#x201D; Ryan Burge, a political scientist and Baptist minister, said the ERLC represents the elite side of a divide within American evangelicals. The ERLC&#x2019;s former president was joined by the Baptist Union of Ukraine in another letter to the speaker. &#x201C;We humbly ask you to consider the plight of Christians,&#x201D; the letter reads. When former President Trump first appeared at the Republican National Convention in July with his running mate JD Vance, an evangelical from Odesa, Ukraine, Pavlo Unguryan, was working the crowd of Republicans. To combat Russian propaganda that Unguryan says reaches Republicans, he knows it&#x2019;s not just about getting the message to Speaker Johnson. He spent the RNC telling fellow conservatives about the repeated history of Russia&#x2019;s targeted repression of religions inside Ukraine that fall outside of Russian Orthodoxy. Speaking to as many Republicans as possible at the RNC, Unguryan explained to conservatives that they can maintain their geopolitical, economic, and military concerns around the war while also supporting further U.S. aid to Ukraine because the war is &#x201C;spiritual.&#x201D; Russia wants to attack all Christian civilization in the West, Unguryan tells Republicans.

(Kirill Chubotin / Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images)The various efforts from Unguryan and others did not conclude with the April aid package. In June, Zelensky became the first head of state to attend the National Prayer Breakfast in Kyiv, a government-hosted event Unguryan brought to Ukraine and replicated off America&#x2019;s annual gathering by the same name where politicians and guests gather to pray. &#x201C;We pray for the continued strength of the Ukrainian forces, the safety of the Ukrainian people, and lasting peace in your homeland,&#x201D; Speaker Johnson said in his video address at Kyiv&#x2019;s prayer breakfast. Johnson&#x2019;s partial shift towards supporting Ukraine and its eventual passage signaled that the strategy was successful and worth continuing. That is why Unguryan plans to return to Washington in early December, just after the inauguration of the 47th president, regardless of who is elected. For Kyiv, this work wasn&#x2019;t just important for one aid package, or any current situation on the front line. American evangelicals are an important part of a long-term building block for the future support Ukraine will need from the U.S., said Jonathan Katz, a national security expert at the Brookings Institute. An evangelical of the vast Southern Baptist denomination from Louisiana, Johnson, who was largely seen as responsible for the stalling and eventual passing of the April aid package, has said he intends to retain speakership after the 2024 presidential election. &#x201C;Mike Johnson, he&#x2019;s not a part of the discourse, he&#x2019;s not a thought leader,&#x201D; Burge said after speaking with many evangelical leaders. &#x201C;I think they all understand that he is the least bad option.&#x201D; However, the Ukrainian faith leaders who&#x2019;ve gone to Washington and sent letters to the speaker have gotten through as Johnson has spoken more about the issue. On the sidelines of the NATO Summit in Washington, Johnson deviated into a passionate and personal tone, detailing his frustrations with Russia&#x2019;s killing of Christian Ukrainians, tying it back to American religious freedom. &#x201C;The communists always do this, they go after the Christians first,&#x201D; Johnson said. &#x201C;Why? Because they believe they owe an allegiance to a power higher than the government, than the state. And so you have to eliminate that&#x2026; And it&#x2019;s vicious and vile, and it shows exactly what Putin and his regime is all about.&#x201D; Despite spending years as a Republican staffer on the Hill and being raised evangelical, Moore was pleasantly surprised to hear these remarks from Johnson. Moore had just returned home from visiting the site of the Okhmatdyt children&apos;s hospital attack in Kyiv when he listened to the speaker. People clear rubble from a building at one of the largest children&#x2019;s hospitals of Ukraine, &#x2018;Okhmatdyt&#x2019;, partially destroyed by a Russian missile strike on July 8, 2024 in Kyiv, Ukraine. (Yevhenii Zavhorodnii/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)&#x201C;After seeing that and hearing Johnson say the things you want a leader to say on national security, that was really cool,&#x201D; Moore said. Although it&#x2019;s unclear how far Johnson will allow his evangelical connections to take him in supporting further aid to Ukraine, he isn&#x2019;t alone on principle. Razom for Ukraine, an advocacy group in Washington, has garnered support for Ukraine in crucial swing districts in the South and Midwest by engaging with evangelical communities and sharing insight into the loss Christian Ukrainians are experiencing. In March 2024, Daniel Balson of Razom took a team to Shreveport, Louisiana, Johnson&#x2019;s hometown. Balson brought Roman Rubchenko, a Ukrainian basketball player with him, who went on a local news program and delivered messages about Ukraine needing sustained support to the conservative state of Louisiana, where he used to play college basketball for a school widely revered in the state. &#x201C;The focus of Shreveport &#x2014; we wanted people there to see themselves in Ukraine, to see themselves as connected to the country,&#x201D; Balson said. Johnson&#x2019;s Shrevport-based team was in a listening capacity when they met with Razom, with the Republican&#x2019;s staffers open and wanting to learn. Less than two months later, Johnson allowed Ukraine to receive the $61 billion in aid. Razom for Ukraine is running billboards in Mike Johnson&#x2019;s home district in Shreveport, Louisiana, US to make sure he knows Ukraine&#x2019;s Baptists are counting on him. (Razom for Ukraine / X (Twitter))&#x201C;Mike Johnson is in some ways a weather vape,&#x201D; Matt Taylor, who studies the intersection of evangelicals and politics at the Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies said. &#x201C;He is a creature of the religious right, he tends to kind of try to triangulate and find the optimal position that will offend the least evangelicals while also trying to not get sideways with Trump.&#x201D; From Shreveport to Wisconsin, when Balson returns to Washington after engagement tours with multi-religious communities, lawmakers on the Hill want to know what he heard and saw in their districts. In these settings, photos &#x2014; shared with Balson by Moore in Kyiv &#x2014; of a Protestant&#x2019;s entire backside bruised from a beating delivered by Russian state security serve useful for Balson&#x2019;s message. And when Balson is in a district hostile toward Ukraine, he reminds voters that, like taxes, childcare, and housing, foreign policy is subject to political pressure, and thus their emotional response to religious freedom is enough to impact conversations in Washington. Speaker Johnson reminded Kyiv of this very matter in late September when &#x2014; amid exchanged hostilities between Trump and Zelensky &#x2014; he signed a letter recommending Zelensky fire his U.S. Ambassador for his visit to an arms manufacturer in a key swing state, Pennsylvania. Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, attended the visit. Republican politicians were not invited. However, given that Johnson already faced threats to oust him as speaker, efforts from the various organizations working in this space are focused on the entire Republican base. Moore, of Ukraine Freedom Project, said he would be disappointed to see Johnson lose the speakership, as he sees him as a good offset to Trump&#x2019;s running mate JD Vance, especially on Ukraine. When Sergeyev, the chaplain, testified in a small room on the Hill, the congressman who Sergeyev most needed his message to reach, Speaker Johnson, wasn&#x2019;t present. Elsewhere on the Hill, up in the Capitol&#x2019;s robust gallery during the fiery speech of Israel&#x2019;s Benjamin Netanyahu that day, two evangelicals sat together watching the procession. One of them was Speaker Johnson and the other, invited as his guest, was Gary Marx, a Republican strategist. After attending Kyiv&#x2019;s prayer breakfast in June, Marx took to the conservative-leaning Washington Times, writing, &#x201C;Patriarch Kiril of the Russian Orthodox Church Moscow Patriarchate has called Russia&#x2019;s attack on Ukraine a &#x2018;holy war,&#x2019; which is synonymous with the Muslim concept of jihad. Ukrainian Christians simply want to live in a free society and worship God as they see fit, just like American evangelicals.&#x201D; Marx, who leads the organization Defenders of Faith and Religious Freedom in Ukraine, which is part of a $3.6 million effort from Kyiv Global Outreach, took the opportunity to remind conservative leaders in Washington of the religious persecution Russia has pursued in Ukraine. The long-held relationship between the speaker and Marx represents the larger, delicate, and often behind-the-scenes efforts to expand U.S. support for Ukraine through American evangelicals not letting up. &#x201C;If (Russian President Vladimir) Putin suddenly embraced the evangelical community and allowed religious freedom, then we wouldn&apos;t really have a leg to stand on but I don&#x2019;t see that happening,&#x201D; Marx said. Unguryan, who was with Johnson on the April day it was decided the aid for Ukraine would pass, said Johnson&#x2019;s ascent to the speakership was just the next step in their time-tested friendship. Serhii Gadarzhi (L), who lost his wife and child in a Russian strike on Odesa, Ukraine, with Mike Johnson, U.S. House Speaker (C), and Pavlo Unguryan (R). (Odesa Regional Association of Baptist Churches /Facebook)Johnson was swayed to allow the aid to pass because evangelicals, like Unguryan, the former member of the Ukrainian parliament from Odesa, were in his ear with continual messages of Christian suffering in Ukraine, according to Marx. It was the combination of sharing anecdotal stories and photographs of Ukrainian Christians suffering hardship at the hands of Russians combined with intelligence briefings Johnson received that convinced him to pass the aid, he added. &#x201C;When you put the personal along with the professional intelligence briefings together, the case is persuasive,&#x201D; Marx said. &#x201C;I think that that&apos;s what made the difference for Speaker Johnson.&#x201D; Unguryan said he routinely shows Johnson the &#x201C;real picture&#x201D; from Ukraine any chance he can, from occupied and burned churches to explaining the &#x2018;holy war&#x2019; he says Russia is carrying out similar to the Islamic State&#x2019;s attacks on Western civilized based on Judeo-Christian values. Months before the U.S. State Department said the Russian state-run media outlet RT was using Kremlin intelligence to spread propaganda, Unguryan was working to counter what he says are false images created by Russian agents by taking his message of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine and the West at-large straight to Capitol Hill. &#x201C;Russia, as a totalitarian criminal country, wants to have an image of a conservative Christian nation but that&#x2019;s not the truth, and I try to communicate that with Mike Johnson,&#x201D; Unguryan said.	https://kyivindependent.com/the-road-to-republican-us-support-of-ukraine-continues-through-evangelicalism/	2024-10-14T13:42:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1191555698.jpg
Russia plans to involve North Korea in war in Ukraine this fall, Zelensky says	Russia plans to involve North Korea directly in the full-scale war against Ukraine this fall and winter, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 14, citing intelligence data. The announcement comes a day after Zelensky warned of an &quot;increasing alliance&quot; between Moscow and Pyongyang. According to Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence, Russia&apos;s plans for the fall and winter include &quot;the actual involvement of North Korea in the war,&quot; Zelensky said. The briefing also included updates on &quot;Russia&apos;s relations with some other countries, that, unfortunately, are investing in prolonging the war,&quot; the president added. Zelensky warned on Oct. 13 that Russia and North Korea were deepening their alliance, saying that the partnership had escalated to the point where North Korea was sending personnel to Ukraine&apos;s front lines along with weapons. &quot;This is no longer just about transferring weapons. It is actually about transferring people from North Korea to the occupying military forces,&quot; he said. The warning followed reports from South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-Hyun that North Korea is likely to deploy regular troops to Ukraine to aid Russia at the front. Reports have also emerged in recent days that North Korean officers were killed in a Ukrainian missile strike in Russian-occupied territory. The Kyiv Independent has not been able to verify these reports, which have not been confirmed beyond a single intelligence source. North Korea has been supplying Russia with ballistic missiles and vast quantities of artillery shells since fall of 2023. Earlier this year, two countries signed a mutual defense pact during Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s visit to Pyongyang. Putin submitted the treaty, which stipulates that either nation must render military assistance to the other in the event of an attack, to the Russian State Duma for ratification on Oct. 14.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-plans-to-involve-north-korea-in-war-in-ukraine-this-fall-zelensky-says/	2024-10-14T12:42:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/zelensky-2.jpeg
Putin submits treaty on strategic partnership with North Korea to parliament	Russian President Vladimir Putin submitted a bill to the State Duma, published online on Oct. 14, to ratify a treaty entailing strategic partnership with North Korea. Among the tenets of the treaty is a stipulation that either country must provide military assistance to the other in the case of an attack. The treaty was first signed by Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June 2024. The defense pact officially enters into effect when both nations ratify the agreement. Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened military cooperation as Russia seeks arms and other support in its full-scale war against Ukraine. In recent weeks, claims of a more direct North Korean presence in Ukraine have increased. President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 13 warned of Russia&apos;s &quot;increasing alliance&quot; with North Korea, saying the partnership had moved beyond an arms deal and is now &quot;actually about transferring people from North Korea to the occupying military forces.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s statement followed reports that several North Korean officers had been killed in a Ukrainian missile strike in occupied Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent has not been able to verify these reports, which have not been confirmed beyond a single intelligence source. South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-Hyun told lawmakers in early October that North Korea was likely planning to send troops to Ukraine to fight alongside Russia. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Oct. 10 dismissed these reports as &quot;fake news.&quot; The agreement signed by Putin and Kim bears similarities to historical treaties. South Korea&apos;s Yonhap news agency noted in June that Article 4 of the treaty, which discusses the obligation to render military assistance, replicates wording from Article 1 of the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance signed by North Korea and the Soviet Union in 1961.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-submits-treaty-on-strategic-partnership-with-north-korea-to-parliament/	2024-10-14T12:32:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2157616618.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russian Tu-134 transport aircraft set ablaze over 1,000 km from Ukraine, military intelligence claims	Key developments on Oct. 14: A Russian Tu-134 military transport aircraft was set on fire at a military airfield in Orenburg Oblast overnight on Oct. 13, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported. &quot;Such Soviet aircraft are used, in particular, to transport the leadership of the Russian Defense Ministry,&quot; HUR said. According to the agency, the plane, which belonged to the 117th Military Transport Aviation Regiment of the Russian Armed Forces, burned to the ground at the Orenburg-2 military airfield. The airfield is located 6 kilometers (3 miles) southwest of the Russian city of Orenburg. The city lies roughly 1,250 kilometers (780 miles) from the front line in Ukraine and 90 kilometers (60 miles) north of the Russia-Kazakhstan border. HUR shared footage of the fire without claiming responsibility for the incident. &quot;Every crime against the Ukrainian people will be duly punished,&quot; the agency added. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the report. The Tupolev Tu-134 is a twin-engined airliner produced in the Soviet Union from 1966-89. Following the crash of a Tu-134 in 2011, which killed 47 people, it was fully withdrawn from commercial service in 2019. VIP private jet versions are still available to buy in Russia, with one currently listed online at $2.5 million. Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Oct. 14 that its forces had captured the village of Levadne in Zaporizhzhia Oblast amid ongoing hostilities in the sector. The statement came after Kyiv&apos;s warnings of a potential Russian push in the southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast just as Moscow&apos;s troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. According to reports, Russian troops renewed attacks in the Zaporizhzhia sector in recent days. Vladyslav Voloshyn, the Southern Defense Forces spokesperson, refuted in a comment for the Kyiv Independent that Russia had launched a major offensive in the sector, saying that Russia is only carrying out local ground assaults. When asked about the alleged seizure of Levadne, Voloshyn said that the situation &quot;is developing quite dynamically&quot; and that each side can regain the initiative. Levadne is located west of the village of Velyka Novosilka, some 170 kilometers (105 miles) from the city of Zaporizhzhia. In recent weeks, Russian troops have intensified attacks against Zaporizhzhia, targeting its civilian infrastructure with guided aerial bombs. Voloshyn warned that Moscow is &quot;amassing personnel&quot; in Zaporizhzhia Oblast on Sept. 28. The spokesperson said then that Russia is readying a new maneuver near the occupied village of Pryiutne close to Levadne but added that a full-blown offensive would require larger numbers. On Oct. 5, Voloshyn said that Russian forces are massing for a breakthrough in the direction of Orikhiv and Mala Tokmachka in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The area was the main axis of Ukraine&apos;s southern counteroffensive in 2023, which led to the liberation of the settlement of Robotyne but achieved no major breakthrough. Some 112,337 residents of Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast left their homes due to hostilities, Russian Ombudsman Tatyana Moskalkova said in an interview published on Oct. 14, citing the country&apos;s Emergency Ministry. After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, authorities in Russian border regions have often reported Ukrainian strikes as the hostilities spilled across the border. The evacuation efforts intensified after Kyiv&apos;s cross-border incursion in Kursk Oblast in early August. Speaking to the Kremlin-controlled outlet Argumenty i Fakty, Moskalkova said that this number includes 12,328 people placed at temporary facilities across Russia and around 100,000 living with relatives and friends. Around 40,000 people refused to evacuate or had already returned to their residences, the official added. Overall, 30,415 residents of Belgorod and Kursk regions and other territories near the Russia-Ukraine border were placed at 960 temporary accommodation facilities across Russia, Moskalkova claimed. This number includes 7,670 children, she added. The official alleged this figure encompasses residents who &quot;fled&quot; Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts two years ago &quot;due to shelling.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify Moskalkova&apos;s claims as Russia has carried out forced deportations of Ukrainian residents of occupied territories, including children. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, claiming to initially seize some 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) but recently facing mounting pressure from growing Russian reinforcements. Kyiv said it would adhere to international humanitarian law in its conduct toward Russian civilians in Kursk Oblast, inviting the U.N. and the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) to &quot;join humanitarian efforts.&quot; The Kremlin has dismissed the move as &quot;provocation.&quot; Soldiers of Ukraine&apos;s 80th Air Assault Brigade crossed into Kursk Oblast two days before Kyiv launched its operation in the Russian region, aiding the subsequent offensive, Pavlo Rozlach, the brigade&apos;s commander, said in an interview with the TSN news program aired on Oct. 13. According to Rozlach, one Ukrainian company sneaked into Kursk Oblast in groups of six soldiers and hid in the forest. Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces helped them to cross the border. When the operation began, the company attacked a Russian stronghold near the border. The successful operation paved the way for the entry of Ukrainian vehicles, the commander said. Ukraine also disrupted Russia&apos;s communication system, which disoriented Russian forces, he added. &quot;There were certain risks. If the enemy had found this company, the element of surprise would have been lost,&quot; Rozlach said. Afterward, two battalions reportedly broke through minefields thanks to engineers and kept on advancing in Kursk Oblast. Following recent attacks by Russian forces against the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukrainian soldiers are holding the line despite Russian attempts to break through. Moscow has transferred around 50,000 soldiers from other sectors of the front to Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Oct. 10. A Russian attack on Kherson Oblast using a first-person view (FPV) drone on Oct. 14 killed two women in their car, Ukraine&apos;s Interior Ministry said. Ukraine liberated the southern city of Kherson from Russian occupation in November 2022. Since then, Russian troops have regularly attacked the city and nearby areas along the western bank of the Dnipro River. In recent weeks, residents of Kherson have reported an increase in indiscriminate Russian attacks using FPV drones on civilian targets in the city and other parts of the oblast, referring to the apparently new strategy as a &quot;human safari.&quot; The most recent incident occurred near the town of Beryslav, located some 75 kilometers east of the city of Kherson, the regional prosecutor&apos;s office said. A civilian vehicle with five people inside was targeted with an FPV drone, killing two women aged 72 and 56, as well as injuring a 72-year-old man and a 63-year-old woman. The driver of the vehicle was unharmed, the Interior Ministry said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russian-tu-134-transport-aircraft-set-ablaze-over-1-000-km-from-ukraine-military-intelligence-claims-2/	2024-10-14T11:18:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-14-083810.png
Russia’s milbloggers celebrate executions of Ukrainian POWs in Kursk region	Russian pro-war milbloggers have reacted to yet more reports of Ukrainian POWs being executed by Moscow&#x2019;s forces by seeking to justify the killings, while some have even called for more. In the latest case of what appears to be an increasingly common occurrence, Russian troops reportedly shot dead nine Ukrainian drone operators who surrendered near the village of Zeleny Shlyakh in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast on Oct. 10. In a counterattack to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion launched two and a half years ago, Ukraine&#x2019;s army more than two months ago conducted an incursion into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, and has controlled a patch of the territory ever since. Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin announced on Oct. 13 that his office had opened an investigation into the killings, describing them as &#x201C;a gross violation of the Geneva Conventions and an international crime.&#x201D; Several prominent milbloggers did not deny the reports but instead argued that the killing of POWs was justified. Several even reveled in the alleged murders. Many Russian milbloggers have a significant following in Russian society, with some having hundreds of thousands of subscribers on Telegram, and others having more than a million. An independent political analyst currently based in Russia told the Kyiv Independent that milbloggers represent a militant and radical minority rather than the majority of the public, but stressed they &#x201C;would be unlikely to function&#x201D; without the blessing of the Kremlin. He spoke on condition of anonymity due to the fear of reprisals.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)&quot;Their Telegram channels have many subscribers, which means that part of society trusts them as sources of information,&quot; he said. &quot;Overall, society is definitely not bloodthirsty and, of course, does not support any executions; only aggressive ultranationalists might support such things.&quot; Russian public support for the war in Ukraine has been strong throughout the full-scale invasion, though some recent polls suggest this is declining. Kremlin authorities have not publicly commented on the report and did not respond to requests for comment. The milbloggers who supported the alleged killing have mostly backed the Kremlin&apos;s policy but sometimes criticized the conduct of the war, arguing that Russia&apos;s approach is not hardline enough. One known as Starshe Eddy (Older than the Edda) with 628,000 followers said the executions were &quot;good but not enough.&quot; &quot;During World War II, there were entire units of the German army that were not taken prisoner,&quot; he wrote. &quot;In our case, the scum who entered Kursk Oblast and were shooting peaceful civilians got what they deserved.&quot; There is no evidence to support this claim. Another known as Rosgvardeyets (Russian Guard member) with 29,000 followers, wrote that &quot;they should have been executed&quot; even if they had surrendered as prisoners of war without fighting. &quot;Drone operators should not be allowed to live,&quot; he wrote. &quot;First extract all the information from them, and then dispose of them... The nature of war has changed. &#x201C;In the past, snipers and pilots weren&apos;t taken prisoner, and now drone operators have been added to the list.&quot; Zapiski veterana (A veteran&#x2019;s notes) with 358,000 followers, accused Ukrainian drone operators of &quot;hunting civilians during the evacuation from Sudzha (in Kursk Oblast) and the Sudzha district.&quot; &quot;These bastards got a fairly humane death,&quot; the blogger wrote. There is no evidence to suggest Ukrainian drone operators hunt civilians in Kursk Oblast or anywhere else on the battlefield. There is, however, extensive and well&#x2013;documented targeting of civilians by Russian drone operators, particularly in Kherson Oblast. The blogger known as Dva Maiora (Two Majors) with 1.18 million followers, justified the killings by saying that the prisoners surrendered only after initially fighting back. &quot;Even the enemy channels write that they didn&#x2019;t try to surrender immediately,&quot; Dva Maiora said. &quot;They fought... These bastards thought that 20 kilometers from the front line, they could continue killing civilians with impunity.&quot; There is no evidence to support Dva Maiora&#x2019;s claims of the drone operators killing civilians. Rybar, one of the best-known milboggers with a following of 1.3 million, attempted to downplay the alleged crime. &quot;Such executions on the front line from both sides of the conflict are far from uncommon,&quot; he said. &quot;One of the most common scenarios is an attempt to escape and seize a weapon, leading to the liquidation of the captives as part of armed combat.&quot; Rybar also said that &quot;captives often become a burden: there is not always an opportunity to assign even a guard to them when you are conducting effective assault operations.&quot; &quot;It&#x2019;s easy to fight from high offices and demand humanity, as long as you&#x2019;re not on the front lines and facing a &#x2018;them or us&#x2019; situation,&quot; he said. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiga posted on X on Oct 13, calling for the international community to take immediate action by issuing warrants for Russian soldiers found to have executed POWs, increasing sanctions, and demanding access to detention sites. Russia&apos;s mistreatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war is absolute barbarism, grave violation of international humanitarian law, laws and customs of war. Executions are becoming more frequent, 95% of POWs are subjected to torture according to the UN, denied basic needs and access. Ukraine&apos;s Obudsman Dmytro Lubinets said that he had submitted information about the alleged killing to the U.N. and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Summary executions by Russians of Ukrainian prisoners of war have sharply risen in the past year. Kyiv knows of 93 Ukrainian POWs who were summarily executed by Russian soldiers on the battlefield throughout the full-scale war, a senior representative of the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on national television on Oct. 4.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-milbloggers-celebrate-executions-of-ukrainian-pows-in-kursk-region/	2024-10-14T10:55:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157902239.jpg
Russia could attack NATO by 2030, German intelligence chief says	Russia will have the military capabilities to be able to attack NATO by 2030, said German intelligence chief Bruno Kahl during a parliamentary hearing on Oct. 14. Kahl&apos;s comments were the latest in a series of increasingly dire warnings from Western leaders and defense officials about the threat emanating from Russia and Europe&apos;s current lack of preparedness. Russia&apos;s determination to use covert and hybrid measures against the West has reached a &quot;level previously unseen,&quot; Kahl said, adding that they are being used &quot;without any scruples.&quot; Moscow&apos;s ultimate goals are to &quot;push the U.S. out of Europe,&quot; roll back NATO boundaries to the 1990s, and create a &quot;Russian sphere of influence&quot; with the aim of cementing a &quot;new world order.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;will continue to test the West&apos;s red lines and further escalate the confrontation,&quot; Kahl said, warning that Russia&apos;s military spending is far outstripping that of the West. Separately, Thomas Haldewang, the chief of Germany&apos;s domestic intelligence agency, said that Russian espionage and sabotage activity in Europe has sharply increased.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-could-attack-nato-by-2030-german-intelligence-chief-says/	2024-10-14T09:24:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2162022838.jpg
New customs reform aims to tackle Ukraine’s ‘single biggest cash cow’ of corrupt money in politics	At a time when state coffers are starving for money to fund Ukraine&#x2019;s survival, illegal smuggling is costing the country billions of dollars a year in lost tax payments. Through bribery or lying, smugglers avoid an estimated $2.4 to $3 billion in customs payments each year as they smuggle everything from cigarettes and iPhones to perfume and food across the border undeclared or mislabeled. Last year, the State Customs Service audited 9,000 cases of declared &#x201C;humanitarian aid&#x201D; entering the country and found that around a third were probably other goods falsely labeled to avoid customs fees. Customs postings can be so lucrative that criminals are willing to shell out large sums for desirable positions: Ukraine&#x2019;s anti-corruption bureau uncovered an attempt earlier this year to bribe officials with $1.7 million into appointing three regional heads of customs who would turn a blind eye to illegal schemes. &#x201C;Customs is perhaps the single biggest cash cow that brings corrupt money into Ukraine&apos;s political system. It&#x2019;s the largest tax-evasion scheme in the country,&#x201D; said Josh Rudolph, a senior fellow and head of the transatlantic democracy working group of the U.S.-based think tank German Marshall Fund. &#xA0; The problem is so severe that Ukrainians view the State Customs Service as the most corrupt institution in the government. Trucks are pictured at the Krakovets-Korczowa checkpoint at the Ukraine-Poland border that was upgraded under the Open Border project, Lviv Oblast, Ukraine on June 20, 2022. (Alona Nikolaievych/Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images)With mounting internal and external pressure on Ukraine to reign in corruption at the border, parliament has passed an extensive new reform bill to overhaul the State Customs Service. After previous failed attempts at reform, increased pressure from Western partners during the war has lent political heft to overhauling the institution. The bill was submitted to the president on Sept. 23 and will take effect after he signs it into law, though its effects of reforms may take years to show up in the state&#x2019;s budget, which is desperate for cash as Russia&#x2019;s war enters its third year. &#xA0; Corruption in customs &#x201C;is a big challenge that requires sweeping reform, and this (bill) is a good starting place,&#x201D; Rudolph said. The most significant change in the bill requires two candidates for the new head of the State Customs Service to be selected by an independent commission, where half the commission&apos;s members are independent foreign experts. This style of selection process &#x2014; which cuts the potential for corrupt influence on choosing appointees &#x2014; is modeled after successful anti-corruption efforts to select heads of other Ukrainian agencies. &#x201C;You need not just the right people, but you also need them to know that they can make good decisions,&#x201D; said Olena Scherban, deputy executive director of the Ukrainian nonprofit Anti-Corruption Action Center (AntAC). &#x201C;In some cases, the (Customs Service&#x2019;s) rules should be changed, but that can only happen when the head of customs won&#x2019;t be politically dependent on people for the appointment.&#x201D; &#x201C;When the head can&#x2019;t be suddenly dismissed and won&#x2019;t be dependent on the decisions of the Finance Ministry and cabinet of ministers,&#x201D; Scherban said, &#x201C;this is when (the head) will understand that they have an opportunity to be independent, and to rein in illegal cash flow from customs and to bring additional money to the state budget.&#x201D; A previous attempt at reforming the Customs Service stalled in 2020, after the then-head of the service Max Nefyodov was dismissed from his post.

(Dominika Zarzycka/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Nefyodov, who had a reputation as an effective anti-corruption reformer and implemented strong transparency policies in his previous post as a deputy economy minister, accused the government of bowing to pressure from powerful smugglers demanding his ousting. The government said that he failed to meet revenue targets. The bill also gives the new head increased independence in choosing deputies, reduces the influence of the finance minister, provides for independent audits carried out by international experts, and requires a one-time recertification process to vet all current department employees. The vetting will look at the integrity of approximately 9,700 current employees and examine the legality of their finances and sources of income. It is expected to take years to complete. &#xA0; &#x201C;You have this saying in the United States that &#x2018;personnel is policy,&#x2019;&#x201D; said Rudolph of the German Marshall Fund. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s going to be a long, challenging process, but I would not underestimate bringing in genuinely new blood and enabling the removal of anyone who&#x2019;s not going to be contributing meaningfully to reform.&#x201D; The economic realities of Russia&#x2019;s invasion heightened the urgency of this major overhaul and made it possible, said the main author of the reform bill, Yaroslav Zhelezniak, lawmaker and first deputy head of Ukraine&apos;s Parliamentary Committee on Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy. &#x201C;We need resources to fund our war from taxes and customs. If something is broken, you have to fix it,&#x201D; Zhelezniak told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Not everyone in the government supported it, to be honest,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;but due to strong support from the speaker of parliament and the head of the coalition and prime minister, we pushed it through parliament.&#x201D; The bill also received a significant boost after foreign partners included it in required reforms linked to foreign aid. Customs reform is one of the necessary steps Ukraine needs to tackle by the end of this month, in order to meet IMF benchmarks to secure the next round of the IMF&#x2019;s $15 billion loan package. Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a first deputy head of the Committee on Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy. (Yaroslav Zhelezniak/ Facebook)Passing the final version of the bill &#x201C;became possible because the IMF, World Bank, and the U.S. included it in their obligations,&#x201D; Zhelezniak noted. &#x201C;The statistic for all obligations connected with receiving money is very simple: 100% of them have been approved. So, there is zero chance for failure when there is a financial obligation.&#x201D; The reforms are also necessary for Ukraine to enter the EU, a key goal of Ukraine as it seeks to strengthen ties with the West. Ukraine submitted its official membership bid in February 2022. &#x201C;Customs in the EU is the cornerstone of the Single Market, which is the key component of European integration,&#x201D; said Igor Dankov, the customs counselor for the Foreign Ministry&#x2019;s Mission of Ukraine to the European Union. &#x201C;EU customs administrations act as one, and Ukraine&apos;s Customs should belong to the EU Customs family. Customs need to strengthen its security functions and be prepared to operate at external borders of the EU. That is why we need reform.&#x201D; Major business associations had also championed this bill, pressuring the government to raise revenue from illegal markets after the government moved to raise taxes on legal businesses. With Ukraine facing a $35 billion budget deficit next year, customs reform was an attempt to mitigate the unpopularity of the country&#x2019;s first wartime tax hike. &#xA0; &#x201C;I would say that this situation with the budget was one of the political enablers for this reform to actually be voted on. Because there is huge pressure from people and from businesses to actually not only raise tax rates but to work on more even tax compliance and on leveling the field,&#x201D; Yurii Gaidai, senior economist at the Kyiv-based Center for Economic Strategy (CES), told the Kyiv Independent last month. &#x201C;The big business pushback helped put these new (custom) reforms into play,&#x201D; he said. &#xA0; Customs reform has long been a goal of Ukraine&#x2019;s business community. Before the full-scale invasion, a 2019 survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine (AmCham) found that 76% of its members believed customs reform should be the top priority for Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament and government. The majority named anti-corruption efforts as the reason. The chamber surveyed hundreds of its members engaging in international trade, which include many of Ukraine&#x2019;s largest employers. &#x201C;The effective operation of customs facilitates trade simplification, reduces costs and delays at the border, and enhances competitiveness and the overall business climate,&#x201D; Vita Miroshnychenko, head of customs and international trade of PwC Ukraine and a co-chair of AmCham, told the Kyiv Independent. During wartime, effective customs work also smooths the transit of humanitarian aid and defense goods, she added. After the president signs the law, it will take time to see results. &#xA0;The law provides two months for a selection committee to be formed, and up to three years for the re-certifications to be carried out. &#x201C;Even if it goes as fast and well as possible, I would not expect to have any fiscal results in the coming budget year,&#x201D; said Gaidai from CES. &#x201C;I would even say that if it&#x2019;s really done properly, we could expect some decrease in tax revenues at first,&#x201D; Gaidai said. &#x201C;Because every time the previous government strived to reform the customs service, they faced sabotage from corrupt people there.&#x201D; Sabotage or undue influence is possible again, said AntAC&#x2019;s Scherban, but there is also a simpler challenge &#x2014; finding quality talent in a war-ravaged populace. Among other similarly structured competitions for high-ranking government officials, &#x201C;we see a lack of real candidates who trust the reforms and want to apply, because of the war. Many talented professional people go to the Armed Forces,&#x201D; said Scherban. &#x201C;The most key, important thing is a successful selection process for the new head of the Customs Service. &#xA0;All the procedures, the recertification, and so on, depend on the head. &#xA0;So, we will monitor the process very closely,&#x201D; said Scherban.

(Pavlo Palamarchuk/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)The signing of the law can still be a powerful signal that change is coming, forcing employees to adjust their expectations and behavior, Zhelezniak noted, citing the experience of similar reforms to other Ukrainian institutions. But it is still only one step of many, Zhelezniak said, adding that he plans to continue working on future reforms that will digitize the agency, reduce opportunities for human interference, bring the agency closer in line with EU customs requirements, and secure the budget to raise salaries and attract better talent. &#x201C;Customs is not technocratic reform,&#x201D; Zhelezniak said. &#x201C;It&apos;s not where you implement one process or one new department and you solve the problem. There are thousands of people on the border who every day, every hour, have to do their job. There is no way to decrease corruption or make it disappear without changing the minds and approaches of these people.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/new-customs-reform-aims-to-tackle-ukraines-single-biggest-cash-cow-of-political-corruption/	2024-10-14T09:12:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1242568981.jpg
Russia sentences French national to 3 years in prison over alleged foreign agents violation	A Moscow court sentenced on Oct. 14 French national Laurent Vinatier to three years and three months in prison over allegedly violating Russia&apos;s &quot;foreign agents&quot; legislation. Vinatier, who holds a PhD and works for the Swiss Center for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD), was arrested while visiting Russia in June for reportedly failing to register as a foreign agent. The &quot;foreign agents&quot; designation requires people and entities who allegedly receive &quot;support&quot; from abroad to place a disclaimer in all of their publishing and mandates strict financial reporting. It is broadly seen as a means to repress domestic opposition. Russian investigators claimed that beyond the violation of the foreign agents registration, Vinatier had plead guilty to illegally obtaining information about the military. There is no way to independently verify the validity of Vinatier&apos;s alleged confession. Russia does not provide transparent access to its legal system, and international human rights organizations have long detailed rampant abuse in prisons, as well as the use of torture to coerce confessions. Russia has routinely arrested foreign nationals, a number of whom were released in a high-profile prisoner exchange in August. Moscow has been accused of detaining foreigners on trumped-up charges and holding them as hostages to leverage the release of Russian nationals held in the West.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-sentences-french-national-to-3-years-in-prison-over-alleged-foreign-agents-violation/	2024-10-14T07:49:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177655148.jpg
North Korean soldiers are reportedly in Ukraine — here's what we know	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 13 warned of Russia&apos;s &quot;increasing alliance&quot; with North Korea, stressing it had moved beyond the supply of just weaponry and was now &quot;actually about transferring people from North Korea to the occupying military forces.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s statement came days after reports that several North Korean officers had been killed in a Ukrainian missile strike in occupied Ukraine, raising speculation about just how involved Pyongyang currently is in Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. &quot;We see an increasing alliance between Russia and regimes like North Korea,&quot; said Zelensky, who has previously pointed to Russia&#x2019;s deepening role within an axis of rogue regimes, including Iran, who are allied against Ukraine and its Western allies. &quot;This is no longer just about transferring weapons. It is actually about transferring people from North Korea to the occupying military forces.&quot; Very little aside from the stated intentions from Moscow and Pyongyang. Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a strategic defense agreement between Moscow and Pyongyang on June 19. As part of the alliance, the North Korean military announced that an engineer unit would join Russian forces on the ground in Donetsk Oblast the following month. No picture or video evidence has emerged to date that this went ahead, and it is not known if the six North Korean officers reportedly killed were part of this unit. On Oct. 4, Russian milbloggers reported that North Korean military personnel were visiting the front lines as part of an &quot;exchange of experience&quot; program and were being shown how Moscow&apos;s forces prepared defensive positions and assault operation techniques. In a press briefing on June 25, Pentagon spokesperson Pat Ryder said North Korean troops would become &quot;cannon fodder&quot; if they joined Russian forces on the battlefield in Ukraine. The reports of six North Korean officers killed in Ukraine have not been confirmed beyond a single intelligence source, though South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-Hyun said earlier this month it was likely true. Zelensky provided no further evidence on Oct. 13, and the Kyiv Independent has been unable to verify the reports. The Guardian reported on Oct. 10, citing an unnamed source in Ukraine, that there are &quot;dozens of North Koreans behind Russian lines&quot; to assist with the launching of Pyongyang-supplied Kn-23 ballistic missiles. Lim Eul-chul, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul, told AFP the deployment of North Korean soldiers in Ukraine could be viewed from Pyongyang as an opportunity for its military to learn &quot;how to handle different weapons and gain real-world combat experience.&quot; &quot;This might even be a driving factor behind sending North Korean soldiers &#x2014; to provide them with diverse experiences and wartime training.&quot; North Korean soldiers waving their national flags as they welcome Russia&apos;s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov after he landed at the airport in Pyongyang, North Korea on Oct. 18, 2023. (Kim Won Jin / AFP via Getty Images)Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Oct. 10 dismissed the reports as &quot;fake news.&quot; A Washington Post (WP) article on Oct. 11 cited a Ukrainian military intelligence official as saying &quot;several thousand&quot; North Korean troops were undergoing training in Russia and could be deployed to Ukraine by the end of the year. It added that North Korean officers were already on the ground in Ukraine in observation roles, but no units of troops had been reported as of yet. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) on Oct. 11 said the deployment of North Korean troops to Ukraine could free up Russian forces to concentrate on priority areas on the front lines. But it also added that if they are of poor quality, North Korean troops &quot;could also create opportunities for Ukrainian exploitation.&quot; There have also been reports of North Korean military or police personnel traveling to join &quot;reconstruction efforts&quot; in occupied Donbas in early 2023. Regardless of whether or not North Korean troops are physically in Ukraine, there is plenty of other evidence to demonstrate the ever-deepening military ties between Moscow and Pyongyang. Isolated on the world stage after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and with ammunition stocks running low after more than two-and-a-half years of war, Russia has become increasingly dependent on North Korean-supplied weaponry. The relationship was solidified in late June, when Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Pyongyang, where he signed the partnership agreement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, pledging to provide aid to one another if either was attacked. In August, South Korea&#x2019;s Yonhap news agency reported North Korea had sent containers presumably to Russia that could contain more than 6 million artillery shells. In exchange for the ammunition, Russia reportedly provided North Korea with technology to help it deploy spy satellites as well as tanks and aircraft.

(Contributor/Getty Images)The Times reported earlier this month that half of all the artillery shells used by Russia in Ukraine are supplied by North Korea. Though a large number of the shells are believed to be faulty, the sheer number being shipped to Moscow&apos;s forces are believed to have played a crucial role in Russia&apos;s grinding advances in eastern Ukraine, most recently the capture of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast earlier this month. Shin Won-sik, South Korean defense minister, said in June that Pyongyang also sent dozens of ballistic missiles that Moscow&apos;s troops fire at Ukraine. But their reliability has also been questioned. &#xA0;Around half of the North Korean missiles fired at Ukraine by Russia have malfunctioned and exploded in mid-air, Reuters reported on May 7, citing Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-soldiers-are-reportedly-in-ukraine-heres-what-we-know/	2024-10-14T06:49:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157690883.jpg
Russian drone attack on Kherson Oblast kills 2	A Russian attack on Kherson Oblast using a first-person view (FPV) drone on Oct. 14 killed two women in their car, Ukraine&apos;s Interior Ministry said. Ukraine liberated the southern city of Kherson from Russian occupation in November 2022. Since then, Russian troops have regularly attacked the city and nearby areas along the western bank of the Dnipro River. In recent weeks, residents of Kherson have reported an increase in indiscriminate Russian attacks using FPV drones on civilian targets in the city and other parts of the oblast, referring to the apparently new strategy as a &quot;human safari.&quot; The most recent incident occurred near the town of Beryslav, located some 75 kilometers east of the city of Kherson, the regional prosecutor&apos;s office said. A civilian vehicle with five people inside was targeted with an FPV drone, killing two women aged 72 and 56, as well as injuring a 72-year-old man and a 63-year-old woman. The driver of the vehicle was unharmed, the Interior Ministry said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-attack-on-kherson-oblast-kills-2/	2024-10-14T06:32:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GZ2gSK7WMAsQ7Hn.jpeg
First Ukrainian troops crossed into Kursk Oblast 2 days before incursion, commander says	Soldiers of Ukraine&apos;s 80th Air Assault Brigade crossed into Kursk Oblast two days before Kyiv launched its operation in the Russian region, aiding the subsequent offensive, Pavlo Rozlach, the brigade&apos;s commander, said in an interview with TSN news program aired on Oct. 13. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, claiming to initially seize some 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) but recently facing mounting pressure as Russia pulls in reinforcements. According to Rozlach, one Ukrainian company sneaked into Kursk Oblast in groups of six soldiers and hid in the forest. Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces helped them to cross the border. When the operation began, the company attacked a Russian stronghold near the border. The successful operation paved the way for the entry of Ukrainian vehicles, the commander said. Ukraine also disrupted Russia&apos;s communication system, which disoriented Russian forces, he added. &quot;There were certain risks. If the enemy had found this company, the element of surprise would have been lost,&quot; Rozlach said. Afterward, two battalions reportedly broke through minefields thanks to engineers and kept on advancing in Kursk Oblast. Following recent attacks by Russian forces against the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukrainian soldiers are holding the line despite Russian attempts to break through. Moscow has transferred around 50,000 soldiers from other sectors of the front to Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Oct. 10.	https://kyivindependent.com/80-brigade-kursk/	2024-10-14T06:04:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166312696.jpg
70% of Russian oil shipped by shadow fleet, posing environment risk, report says	Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of old and poorly insured tankers transports 70% of the country&apos;s seaborne oil exports, according to an analysis published by the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) Insititute on Oct. 14. The report&apos;s conclusions underscore how Moscow is successfully evading the West&apos;s attempts to stifle its oil revenues through the $60-per-barrel price cap imposed two years ago. The G7 unveiled the cap in late 2022 in an effort to undermine Russian fossil fuel profits, which feed Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine, while minimizing impacts on the global oil market. To circumvent this restriction, Russia has invested $10 billion in expanding its shadow fleet since 2022, the KSE Institute&apos;s report said. In the first half of 2024, almost 75% of Russian seaborne oil was reportedly shipped through northern European waters&#x2014;including the Danish Straits and the English Channel&#x2014;with roughly 60% of that carried by shadow tankers that are, on average, 18 years old. The Ukraine-based think tank underscored the environmental risks posed by the shadow tankers, as these often uninsured and aging vessels increase the danger of oil spills. Bloomberg reported in September that tankers also often reject the services of experienced Danish pilots when navigating the country&apos;s dangerous shipping straits, further increasing the risks. The KSE Institute called for a coordinated approach to tackle Russia&apos;s shadow fleet to &quot;protect the environment and ensure overall maritime safety in coalition waters.&quot; The report proposed several concrete steps, including mandatory insurance disclosure for vessels in the price cap coalition&apos;s waters. The coalition should also work with the &quot;flag states&quot; &#x2014; the nations under whose flags the vessels choose to sail &#x2014; through diplomatic channels and commercial incentives to ensure their compliance with international regulations. Tankers that do not adhere to these regulations should be sanctioned, and &quot;coalition countries should have the authority to stop vessels posing immediate environmental or safety risks,&quot; the KSE Institute recommended. The U.S., the EU, and other Western partners have been imposing additional sanctions against tankers and companies evading the price cap since late 2023. The think tank noted that sanctions imposed against the shadow fleet have not impacted global oil prices and that Russia is unlikely to cut production. This means that the proposed steps would cause only minimal disruptions to global markets, the report concluded.	https://kyivindependent.com/shadow-fleet-environment/	2024-10-14T05:50:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1822474446.jpeg
Kyiv rebukes Jared Leto over controversial remarks on Russia, war	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry criticized Jared Leto, a U.S. actor and Thirty Seconds To Mars frontman, for his remarks made at a concert in Belgrade on Oct. 11. During his performance, Leto asked the audience if there were many Russians among them, which was met with screams of joy. The musician subsequently said that he missed Russia and would visit once &quot;all these problems are finished,&quot; referring to Moscow&apos;s full-scale war on Ukraine. &quot;We&apos;re going to come back to Serbia, we&apos;re going to go up to St. Petersburg over Moscow. We&apos;re going to drop down to Kyiv. We&#x2019;re gonna party and hang out with everybody,&quot; the singer said. After the footage of Leto&apos;s remarks went viral, he faced backlash from Ukrainians on social media. The Foreign Ministry said that Leto&apos;s &quot;feeling the Russian energy&quot; and his wish to perform in Russia &quot;is an insult to those sacrificing lives to defend freedom.&quot; &quot;There can be no appeasement for Russia when it continues its attempts to solve the &apos;problem&apos; of Ukraine&apos;s very existence,&quot; the ministry added. Leto and his team did not respond to the criticism. The musician had been performing in Ukraine and Russia before February 2022. After Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, he voiced his support for Ukraine. In 2013, Leto supported the Revolution of Dignity and later visited Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) in Kyiv, where protests took place to pay tribute to the &quot;Heavenly Hundred,&quot; the activists killed during the revolution. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-slams-jared-leto/	2024-10-14T05:12:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2171095555.jpg
EU sanctions Iran over missile shipments to Russia	The EU on Oct. 14 adopted sanctions against seven individuals and seven entities over Iran&apos;s missile and drone shipments to Russia amid its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Brussels joins the U.S. and other Western powers that have slapped sanctions on Iran after it was revealed that Tehran supplied Fath-360 close-range ballistic missiles to Moscow. The EU&apos;s sanctions list newly includes individuals and entities responsible for the development and transfer of drones and missiles for use by Russia. &quot;The Iranian regime&apos;s support to Russia&apos;s war of aggression against Ukraine is unacceptable and must stop,&quot; European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on X. &quot;I therefore welcome the adoption of our sanctions against individuals and entities in response to Iran&apos;s drone and missile transfers to Russia.&quot; The listings include three Iranian airlines &#x2013; Saha Airlines, Mahan Air, and Iran Air &#x2013; as well as two procurement companies and two producers of propellant used to launch the missiles. The Council of the EU also sanctioned Iranian Deputy Defense Minister Seyed Hamzeh Ghalandari and top officials of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, including its Aerospace Force Space Division. Restrictive measures were further imposed against managing directors of the EU-listed companies Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industries (HESA) and Aerospace Industries Organization (AIO). Moscow and Tehran have deepened military and political ties since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with Iran supplying Russia with Shahed attack drones and missiles. After meeting Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Russian leader Vladimir Putin said that the two countries &quot;are actively working together in the international arena&quot; and their &quot;assessments of events taking place in the world are often very close.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-sanctions-iran/	2024-10-14T04:28:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1230595884.jpg
Russian strike on Odesa port kills 1, injures 8, damages civilian vessels	Russia attacked the southern city of Odesa&apos;s port infrastructure with a ballistic missile on Oct. 14, killing one person and injuring eight others, Governor Oleh Kiper reported. The attack damaged two civilian vessels &#x2014; NS Moon flying the flag of Belize and the Palau-flagged Optima, Kiper said. Russia targeted the latter ship last week on Oct. 7. In recent days, Russia stepped up its attacks against port infrastructure in Odesa Oblast, damaging several civilian ships. &quot;The purpose of these attacks is to reduce our export potential,&quot; said Oleksii Kuleba, the minister for the development of communities, territories, and infrastructure. &quot;This is a deliberate provocation of a food crisis in those parts of the world that are directly dependent on Ukrainian grain supplies.&quot; A grain warehouse, cargo cranes, and machinery were also damaged in the missile attack on Odesa, according to Kuleba. The victims are Ukrainians, employees of the port infrastructure. Over the past three months, Russia has carried out nearly 60 such attacks, damaging and destroying nearly 300 port infrastructure facilities and 22 civilian vessels, Kuleba said on Oct. 10. Over 80 civilians were killed or injured as a result of these strikes. Traveling along the route, Ukrainian ships are regularly at risk of being attacked by Russia. Since the beginning of the all-out war, mines have also been drifting along the trade route, which also poses a risk to maritime transport. Kyiv was forced to set up a new export route in the Black Sea last year after Russia unilaterally terminated the Black Sea grain deal. Initially envisioned as a humanitarian corridor to allow the departure of ships stranded there since the start of the full-scale war, it has since grown into a full-blown trade route.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-odesa/	2024-10-14T04:12:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1587644884.jpg
Russia claims capture of Zaporizhzhia Oblast village, Kyiv says 'situation dynamic'	Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Oct. 14 that its forces had captured the village of Levadne in Zaporizhzhia Oblast amid ongoing hostilities in the sector. The statement came after Kyiv&apos;s warnings of a potential Russian push in the southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast just as Moscow&apos;s troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. According to reports, Russian troops renewed attacks in the Zaporizhzhia sector in recent days. Vladyslav Voloshyn, the Southern Defense Forces spokesperson, refuted in a comment for the Kyiv Independent that Russia had launched a major offensive in the sector, saying that Russia is only carrying out local ground assaults. When asked about the alleged seizure of Levadne, Voloshyn said that the situation &quot;is developing quite dynamically&quot; and that each side can regain the initiative.

(DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Levadne is located west of the village of Velyka Novosilka, some 170 kilometers (105 miles) from the city of Zaporizhzhia. &#xA0; In recent weeks, Russian troops have intensified attacks against Zaporizhzhia, targeting its civilian infrastructure with guided aerial bombs. Voloshyn warned that Moscow is &quot;amassing personnel&quot; in Zaporizhzhia Oblast on Sept. 28. The spokesperson said then that Russia is readying a new maneuver near the occupied village of Pryiutne close to Levadne but added that a full-blown offensive would require larger numbers. On Oct. 5, Voloshyn said that Russian forces are massing for a breakthrough in the direction of Orikhiv and Mala Tokmachka in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The area was the main axis of Ukraine&apos;s southern counteroffensive in 2023, which led to the liberation of the settlement of Robotyne but achieved no major breakthrough.	https://kyivindependent.com/levadne/	2024-10-14T03:54:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1733436357.webp
Over 110,000 residents of Kursk Oblast evacuated, Russia's chief ombudsman claims	Some 112,337 residents of Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast left their homes due to hostilities, Russian Ombudsman Tatyana Moskalkova said in an interview published on Oct. 14, citing the country&apos;s Emergency Ministry. After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, authorities in Russian border regions have often reported Ukrainian strikes as the hostilities spilled across the border. The evacuation efforts intensified after Kyiv&apos;s cross-border incursion in Kursk Oblast in early August. Speaking to the Kremlin-controlled outlet Argumenty i Fakty, Moskalkova said that this number includes 12,328 people placed at temporary facilities across Russia and around 100,000 living with relatives and friends. Around 40,000 people refused to evacuate or had already returned to their residences, the official added. Overall, 30,415 residents of Belgorod and Kursk regions and other territories near the Russia-Ukraine border were placed at 960 temporary accommodation facilities across Russia, Moskalkova claimed. This number includes 7,670 children, she added. The official alleged this figure encompasses residents who &quot;fled&quot; Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts two years ago &quot;due to shelling.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify Moskalkova&apos;s claims as Russia has carried out forced deportations of Ukrainian residents of occupied territories, including children. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, claiming to initially seize some 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) but recently facing mounting pressure from growing Russian reinforcements. Kyiv said it would adhere to international humanitarian law in its conduct toward Russian civilians in Kursk Oblast, inviting the U.N. and the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) to &quot;join humanitarian efforts.&quot; The Kremlin has dismissed the move as &quot;provocation.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-kursk-oblast-evacuations/	2024-10-14T03:33:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166685846.jpg
Ukraine's victory plan includes more Storm Shadow, ATACMS missiles, presidential advisor says	Ukraine&apos;s victory plan includes a request for greater numbers of ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles and a permission to launch then against military targets in Russia, presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak told the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) in comments published on Oct. 14. President Volodymyr Zelensky pitched the five-step plan, which was presented as a way to just and lasting peace in Ukraine, to leaders of the leading Western powers, hoping to rally international support behind it. The victory plan includes specific military, economic, political, and diplomatic steps aimed at pressuring Russia toward ending its war, Podolyak told the WSJ. According to the advisor, permission to strike military targets deep inside Russian territory could ramp up domestic pressure in Russia, weaken Russian forces, and thus change Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s strategic calculus. Ukraine has received several long-range systems from its partners, including U.S.-made ATACMS, French SCALP, and British Storm Shadow, but was not permitted to use them against targets within Russian territory. Podolyak also said that without further aid for Ukraine, the war could continue for years and undermine the Western global standing. If Ukraine is forced to negotiate from a weaker position, it will only embolden Putin to seek full control over the country, he added. Ukraine has provided general outlines of its victory plan but has yet to disclose the full details. Speaking on national television on Oct. 12, Podolyak said that the plan would be published within the coming days. Zelensky urged Ukraine&apos;s partners for a &quot;decisive action&quot; to bring Russia&apos;s war to an end by next year. The situation grows ever more dire for Kyiv as Russian forces continue grinding on in Ukraine&apos;s east and worries grow about the future U.S. support after the presidential election in November. There are fears that if Donald Trump returns to the White House, he will scale down or withdraw U.S. support and pressure Ukraine toward painful concessions.	https://kyivindependent.com/victory-plan-storm-shadow-atacms/	2024-10-14T02:10:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2058352604.jpg
Losing independence is worse than spending a few extra percentage points on defense, Estonian defense minister says	Estonia has emerged as a staunch advocate for Ukraine in its fight against Russia, pushing its NATO allies to step up military aid and make long-term commitments to Kyiv&#x2019;s defense. Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur has been at the forefront of this effort, urging Kyiv&apos;s partners not merely to help Ukraine fight on, but also to achieve victory. Sharing a border with Russia, the Baltic country of 1.3 million fears that if Ukraine falls, Tallinn might become the next target of Moscow&apos;s expansionist ambitions. A year and a half after the first interview, the Kyiv Independent sat down with Minister Pevkur again at the Warsaw Security Forum on Oct. 1 to discuss the current state of support for Ukraine and Tallinn&apos;s preparation for a potential clash with Russia. Occupied by Moscow for half a century, Estonia understands the need to invest more in their own defense and to support Kyiv, the minister says. While Estonia is the leading supporter of Ukraine in terms of GDP per capita, Pevkur believes this to be the &quot;absolute minimum&quot; of what the allies need to do. After all, helping Ukraine win the war is the way to avoid an open clash between NATO and Russia, he explains. The Kyiv Independent: Estonia has been spearheading the idea that allies should devote 0.25% of their GDP to military aid to Ukraine every year. Has this proposal found wider support among the allies? Hanno Pevkur: It has. Not all allies are doing that, but many are. The Baltic states, Poland, and Norway, have been doing it for a long time, and Denmark has been doing a lot. So there are many, many allies who are doing that, but this is a trigger to help Ukraine more. We all understand that it doesn&apos;t matter if it&apos;s 0.25% or 1%; the clear aim is still the same: to help Ukraine win the war. The Kyiv Independent: What capabilities does Ukraine need the most right now? Hanno Pevkur: It&apos;s not a secret. Air defense is very critical because Russia is still conducting a huge number of air raids. And that means every layer of the air defense, starting from just machine guns and ending with the Patriots. Of course, ammunition is still very needed on the battlefield. But even with these two main critical needs, Ukraine needs additional training, equipment, basically everything. We are approaching winter, which means that it will also be important to focus on these needs, which are especially important during winter. Members of the Estonian Defence Forces are seen during an exercise near Tapa, Estonia, on May 19, 2023. (Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: Your country has devoted more than 1% of its GDP to aiding Ukraine. Are you worried that this might undermine your own defense capabilities? Hanno Pevkur: Of course, it has affected us. But we understand that this is what we do for Ukraine at the moment. It is the absolute minimum because helping Ukraine today helps them fight this war&#x2026; but not only to fight. I always said that our aim should not be to help Ukraine fight this war, but our aim should be that Ukraine will win this war. We&apos;ve been lucky that Estonian taxpayers have been very understanding, that we have collected new taxes, and we have had some international donors. At the moment, I can say that everything we have in Estonia is now in bigger quantities than it was before the full-scale war started in Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent: Estonia is planning to introduce a security tax, you are planning to increase defense spending, which may eventually have an impact on people&apos;s living standards and the economy. Do you think that Estonian society, and the societies in other Western countries, are ready for that? Hanno Pevkur: If we don&apos;t do that, we risk losing freedom and independence. When you lose independence, then the consequence is much more dramatic than spending a couple of percentages more on defense. We&apos;ve seen that in 1940 and during the 50 years of occupation, we lost dramatically. Before the Second World War, the Estonian economy in terms of GDP was the same as it was in Finland. After 50 years, the difference was 17 times (greater for Finland). So this is the answer: we want to live in freedom, in an independent country. Everybody understands why it is important to pay so much attention to defense. The Kyiv Independent: Your intelligence warned that NATO should be ready for an open clash with Russia within the next decade. What other practical steps is Estonia taking to prepare itself for such an eventuality? Hanno Pevkur: First, we are in an alliance called NATO. This club has been successfully defending the peace in the Euro-Atlantic zone for 75 years. This is the biggest and strongest deterrence for any of our adversaries, that we are strong and even stronger together. Now, Finland and Sweden have also joined NATO, we have increased our defense spending, acquired new ammunition, and a lot of new capabilities in order to defend ourselves. We have basically increased our Territorial Defense Forces two times. We&apos;ve done many things to be ready to defend our country and our people. Estonia&apos;s Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur attends the GLOBSEC regional security forum in Prague, Czech Republic on Aug. 31, 2024. (Michal Cizek / AFP via Getty Images)But deterrence means that our defense lies on three pillars. The first one is defense willingness, which is very high in Estonian society. The second one is defense readiness. This is what we are doing. I have already mentioned all the procurements and new capabilities. The third one is defense cooperation, which means NATO, the European Union, bilateral cooperation agreements, and regional cooperation, such as among the Baltic states or the Joint Expeditionary Force (a U.K.-led military partnership in northern Europe). And we have (allied troops) in Estonia. On a daily basis, we have more than 2,000 allied soldiers in Estonia from three nuclear countries: the United States, France, and the United Kingdom. This is a very strong deterrent message. The Kyiv Independent: Russian missiles and drones have repeatedly violated allied airspace, including in your neighbor, Latvia. If Russian projectiles enter Estonian airspace, would the Estonian military shoot them down? Hanno Pevkur: We have a very clear protocol in place for what happens. Don&apos;t forget that we are living in peacetime. During peacetime, the airspace is open, which means that before shooting something down, we have to identify it to be 100% clear and certain what we will shoot down. But the protocol is there, and everybody can be safe and secure. There is a list of measures that will be undertaken if something like this happens. The Kyiv Independent: Some NATO planners projected that in the case of an open clash with Russia, the Baltic states might be overrun before reinforcements can arrive. How do you view these predictions, seeing Ukraine&apos;s experience with Russian occupation? Hanno Pevkur: I don&apos;t have that crystal ball, and I don&apos;t want to have this crystal ball. I know that the Estonian Army is ready to defend our country and our people. I know that our allies are ready to do that and that the new regional plans consider all these risks. We will do everything in the near future to be ready to fully implement these plans. I have no doubts about our allies, and I believe that nobody should have any doubts about the alliance. The Kyiv Independent: How can NATO avoid an open clash with Russia? Hanno Pevkur: To help Ukraine win the war and to do everything to increase defense spending in order to increase defense capabilities. And, of course, we should send out this deterrence message that we are united, that we are not divided, and that we are crystal clear with our actions if necessary.	https://kyivindependent.com/our-aim-should-be-not-to-help-ukraine-fight-but-to-help-it-win-estonian-defense-minister-tells-the-kyiv-independent/	2024-10-14T02:03:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2160736180.jpg
Russia reportedly launches no Shahed drones against Ukraine overnight for first time in over month	Russian forces did not launch any Shahed-type drone overnight on Oct. 14 for the first time since late August, according to monitoring channels. The lull came after Russia attacked Ukraine with more than 1,300 Shahed kamikaze drones in September, launching them across the country on a daily basis for an entire month. This daily trend has continued for the first days of October. Overnight on Oct. 3, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported that Russia launched 105 Shahed-type drones, targeting settlements across the country. Ukrainian monitoring Telegram channels reported that Russia did not use a single Shahed for the first time in 48 days. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported that Moscow&apos;s forces launched several guided aerial bombs against Sumy and Zaporizhzhia oblasts overnight. Russia has launched thousands of cheap but effective Iranian-designed Shahed-type drones against Ukraine since the fall of 2022. While initially sourcing them from Iran, in an August 2023 report, the U.K. Defense Ministry said Russia had begun domestic production.	https://kyivindependent.com/shaheds-oct-14/	2024-10-14T01:19:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1489471985.jpg
NATO holding annual nuclear drills involving 2,000 troops, 60 aircraft	NATO begins its annual nuclear exercises, Steadfast Noon, on Oct. 14, involving nuclear-capable fighter jets but not live weaponry. The two-week drills will involve over 2,000 military personnel and 60 aircraft from eight airbases. They will take place in Belgium, the Netherlands, and in the airspace over Denmark, the U.K., and the North Sea, with 13 NATO countries sending aircraft to participate. The routine drills come amid heightened tensions as Russia changed its nuclear doctrine, lowering the threshold for its nuclear response. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly made nuclear threats against Ukraine and its Western partners since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The threats have failed to materialize, and Russia continues to wage its all-out war without using its nuclear arsenal. &quot;Nuclear deterrence is the cornerstone of Allied security,&quot; NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said. &quot;Steadfast Noon is an important test of the Alliance&apos;s nuclear deterrent and sends a clear message to any adversary that NATO will protect and defend all Allies.&quot; The drills involve various aircraft, including bombers, fighter escorts, refueling aircraft, and planes capable of reconnaissance and electronic warfare. This year, the first F-35A from the Dutch Air Force was declared ready to perform nuclear roles.	https://kyivindependent.com/steadfast-noon/	2024-10-14T00:54:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1244056280.jpg
Opinion: Documenting war ethically means going beyond capturing suffering	When a country goes through a war, documentarians often feel empowered to capture reality with the aim of creatively reflecting the pain on both a national and personal level. As the history of documentary cinema shows, such conditions can be the birthplace of groundbreaking films that shape the genre. Yet, as film theorist Bill Nichols wrote, &quot;The successful careers of many documentary filmmakers have been built on the misfortune of others.&quot; During Ukraine&apos;s 10 years of war, approaches to documenting reality have continually evolved. Ukrainian filmmakers are often said to use the camera as a weapon, recording war crimes and their consequences through various technologies. However, even with the best of intentions, this weapon can wound. The camera has immense power; it invades the personal space of those experiencing pain and risks turning their suffering into spectacle. The common ethical dilemma is how to portray war effectively while finding the right ethical angle for both the subjects and the audience. This question became crucial when Mstyslav Chernov&#x2019;s &quot;20 Days in Mariupol&quot; won an Oscar, marking the first time a Ukrainian film received such a prestigious award. The film garnered significant attention, shocking global audiences with its brutal depictions of suffering, pain, and death. Chernov skillfully balanced hyper-realistic images with a deeply personal narrative to mitigate ethical risks, even using blurred faces to lessen the stark realism. However, despite these efforts, the film raises the ethical threshold for what can be shown on screen. To impress international audiences again, future filmmakers may have to push beyond the boundaries Chernov crossed. Analyzing films that uncompromisingly depict the full-scale invasion and its victims, critics often turn to theoretical reflections on the ethics of documenting suffering. Susan Sontag&apos;s &quot;Regarding the Pain of Others&quot; is frequently cited for its exploration of the ethics surrounding the capture and viewing of suffering. Several studies have examined the representation of sensitive war images and their mediation to viewers through audiovisual media. While these works analyze a range of conflicts, the authors often reach the same conclusion: Viewers&apos; sensitivity decreases over time, and even the most acute directorial manipulations will inevitably fail to fully convey a victim&apos;s suffering, risking the devaluation of their experience. The good news is that the ethical deadlock Ukrainian documentaries seemed to face did not occur. Instead, directors have undergone a transformation, finding new subgenres and approaches. Globally, recent films about war are more creatively experimental, often narrowing their focus to present and reflect war from a concise angle. War, initially shocking and sudden, becomes a static, prolonged frustration, and Ukrainian documentary cinema has adeptly captured this evolution. A screenshot from the Oscar-nominated Ukrainian documentary &quot;20 Days in Mariupol,&quot; which covers Russian forces&apos; siege of Mariupol, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, amid Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. (Facebook)Observational documentaries are becoming more prominent. These films consist primarily of unmediated observations of reality, with minimal interference from the filmmaker. While different approaches exist, Ukrainian documentaries increasingly commit to static shots and a certain detachment from catastrophic events. Ethics are often assessed by the camera&#x2019;s distance from subjects or events, leading to an abundance of long, static shots from afar, with fewer close-ups of suffering faces or bodies. In Olga Zhurba&apos;s &quot;Songs of Slow Burning Earth,&quot; the director metaphorically conveys the waning sensitivity to war through observational filming and poetic editing. The film captures the phenomenon of normalization, portraying the transition from initial shock to stability. Zhurba presents suffering as a canvas that covers all of Ukraine, avoiding the devaluation of any single experience and instead incorporating it into the broader picture of war and its aftermath. Another notable example is JuriRechinsky&apos;s &quot;Dear Beautiful Beloved,&quot; which juxtaposes footage of the evacuation of soldiers&apos; corpses with scenes of elderly evacuees in temporary housing. Rechinsky maintains distance when filming the dead, while drawing closer to the elderly, crafting a humanistic focus. Oksana Karpovych&#x2019;s &quot;Intercepted&quot; offers a unique approach. An observational documentary composed of long static shots of war-torn Ukraine, it minimizes the presence of people and avoids live footage of explosions or battles. The film&#x2019;s power lies in its audio &#x2013; intercepted phone calls from Russian occupiers. The juxtaposition of these calls with images of a devastated Ukraine creates a strong cause-and-effect narrative, radically shifting the focus from the victims to those responsible for their suffering. &quot;Intercepted&quot; may be the most internationally recognized Ukrainian film of 2024, a striking example of how to depict war without exploiting pain. Another emerging trend in Ukrainian documentary cinema is character-driven storytelling. These films focus on creating in-depth portraits of individuals or social groups, often set against the backdrop of war. By spending significant time with their subjects, filmmakers show solidarity with their pain, employing a more intimate cinematic language. This approach is evident in &quot;Mission 200,&quot; which follows a volunteer who transports soldiers&apos; bodies. Director Volodymyr Sydko focuses on protagonist Tetyana&#x2019;s monologues, allowing her to slowly trust the camera, while bodies in black bags remain in the background of the story. Character-driven documentaries also offer opportunities to explore narrow social contexts unfamiliar to Western audiences. Lesia Diak&#x2019;s &quot;Dad&#x2019;s Lullaby&quot; follows a man who served in Donbas before the full-scale invasion, struggling to return to family life. Diak, who has personal experience with post-traumatic behavior from dating a military man, navigates the ethical risks by sharing her own painful reflections on camera, filming herself from the same distance she maintains from her protagonist. As the war continues, Ukrainian filmmakers are finding new ethical approaches that keep their documentaries in the global conversation. It&#x2019;s no exaggeration to say that we will see even more innovative and thoughtful approaches in the future, as filmmakers balance the experiences of both those who suffer and those who watch.

Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 5, injure 8 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed five people and injured eight others over the past day, regional authorities said on Oct. 14. Four people were killed in the town of Chasiv Yar and in the villages of Zvanivka and Vyshneve in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Three more people were injured in the region over the past day. A 56-year-old man suffered injuries as a result of a Russian drone attack in the town of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted eight settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. One person was killed, and four were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Russian attacks damaged three high-rise buildings, six houses, cars, gas pipelines, and a warehouse. One person was killed, and four others injured, according to the governor.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-5-injure-7-over-past-day/	2024-10-14T00:32:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-13_09-50-53.jpg
US ready for talks with Russia, China, North Korea to reduce nuclear threat, Biden says	Washington is ready to engage in talks with Russia, China, and North Korea without preconditions to reduce the nuclear threat, U.S. President Joe Biden said on Oct. 13. Biden made his statement while congratulating the winners of the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize, the Japanese organization Nihon Hidankyo grouping survivors of the atomic bombings of Japan almost 80 years ago, for their campaign to rid the world of nuclear weapons. The comments came after Russia adopted changes to its nuclear doctrine, lowering the threshold for its nuclear response. &quot;There is no benefit to our nations or the world to forestall progress on reducing nuclear arsenals,&quot; Biden said. &quot;Reducing the nuclear threat is important not despite the dangers of today&#x2019;s world but precisely because of them.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly made nuclear threats against Ukraine and the West since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The threats have failed to materialize, and Russia continues to wage its all-out war without using its nuclear arsenal. In late September, Putin expanded the scenarios that could trigger a Russian nuclear response, including reliable intelligence of a large-scale cross-border attack involving aircraft, missiles, or drones. He also said that any attack on Russia backed by a nuclear power would be treated as a joint assault. The Kremlin claimed the move was a direct response to discussions in the U.S. and U.K. about allowing Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory with Western-supplied long-range conventional missiles. North Korea has become one of Russia&apos;s leading allies in its full-scale war against Ukraine, providing ammunition and missiles and reportedly sending military staff to aid Russian forces. China claimed neutrality in the war but backed Moscow in the face of Western sanctions and became Russia&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods feeding the Russian defense industry. President Volodymyr Zelensky warned of &quot;increasing alliance&quot; between Moscow and Pyongyang on Oct. 13 following reports that North Korea is likely to deploy regular troops to Ukraine to aid Russia at the front.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-ready-for-talks-with/	2024-10-14T00:25:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174506605.jpg
German opposition leader would deliver Taurus to Ukraine after certain steps	Friedrich Merz, an opposition candidate for the German chancellor, said he is open to supplying Taurus long-range missiles to Ukraine but under some conditions, N-TV reported on Oct. 14. Despite providing extensive military aid to Kyiv, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been adamant in his position not to approve the supply of the Taurus missiles, citing a fear of escalation. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t do it just like that,&quot; Merz said on the ARD channel regarding the supply of the Taurus missiles. At first, there should be an appeal to Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop attacking civilian targets in Ukraine. If Moscow does not concede, Ukraine should be free to use already delivered weapons without restrictions, said the German opposition leader. Merz is the parliamentary leader and chancellor candidate of the center-right CDU/CSU, which is leading the polls one year before the federal parliamentary elections. This makes him currently the most likely candidate to unseat social democrat Scholz. &quot;And the second step would be to supply the Taurus missiles. Then it is up to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin to decide how far he wants to escalate this war,&quot; Merz said. Taurus is a joint German-Swedish cruise missile with a range of over 500 kilometers (310 miles). It boasts a longer reach than missiles that Ukraine has received from other partners, such as the British-French-made SCALP/Storm Shadow and American ATACMS. Merz criticized the ruling coalition for allowing Moscow to know all the details of its strategy by discussing its steps publicly. The opposition leader added that the decision on the Taurus supply should be made at the European level and that European countries should become less dependent on the U.S. regarding support for Ukraine. While Ukraine has deployed Western long-range arms for strikes against Russian military targets within Ukrainian territory, Kyiv&apos;s partners have not permitted their use on Russian soil. Washington and Berlin have permitted the use of certain German and American weaponry just across the Russian border to disrupt Russia&apos;s offensive operations. Scholz has been under prolonged pressure from his opponents in the parliament and, reportedly, even coalition partners to greenlight the supply of Taurus. The German chancellor said he would not approve their supply even if other partners decided to lift restrictions on long-range strikes in Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/merz-taurus-missiles/	2024-10-13T23:35:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161390043.jpg
Russian Tu-134 aircraft set ablaze in Orenburg Oblast, military intelligence claims	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. A Russian Tu-134 military transport aircraft was set on fire at a military airfield in Orenburg Oblast overnight on Oct. 13, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported. &quot;Such Soviet aircraft are used, in particular, to transport the leadership of the Russian Defense Ministry,&quot; HUR said. According to the agency, the plane, which belonged to the 117th Military Transport Aviation Regiment of the Russian Armed Forces, burned down at the Orenburg-2 airfield. HUR shared footage showing the fire, without claiming responsibility for the incident. &quot;Every crime against the Ukrainian people will be duly punished,&quot; the agency added. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the report.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-tu-134/	2024-10-13T22:45:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/--------------2024-10-14-083810.png
Russia hasn't received request for Scholz-Putin call, Kremlin claims	Moscow has not received a proposal from Berlin for a phone call between German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Russian pro-state news agency Interfax on Oct. 13. &quot;No. There were no proposals. We have said repeatedly that Putin remains open to contact,&quot; Peskov claimed. The statement came two days after German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said that Putin is not willing to speak with Scholz about brokering peace in Ukraine. &quot;He refuses to accept peace and every day sends another signal in favor of war and destruction. These days, he is no longer even prepared to speak to the German chancellor on the phone,&quot; the German foreign minister said. The German newspaper Zeit reported on Oct. 1 that, according to government sources, Scholz is hoping to talk to Putin by phone for the first time in almost two years. A German government spokesperson said in September that Scholz would talk to Putin &quot;when the time comes,&quot; but &quot;for now, we have to wait.&quot; The two leaders held the last phone call in December 2022. The German chancellor met Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky during the latter&apos;s visit to Berlin on Oct. 11. Scholz used the occasion to reveal the delivery of a $660-million aid package, including an IRIS-T air defense system, to Ukraine. Berlin will also work together with Belgium, Denmark, and Norway to supply Ukraine with an assistance tranche worth $1.5 billion, the chancellor said. Initially a hesitant partner, Germany has become Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor after the U.S. In a media interview in early September, Scholz urged speedier efforts at resolving the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. &quot;I believe that now is the moment when we must discuss how we get out of this war situation faster than the current impression is,&quot; the chancellor said.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-scholz/	2024-10-13T22:35:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245735181.jpeg
General Staff: Russia has lost 670,190 troops since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 670,190 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 14. This number includes 1,260 casualties Russian forces suffered over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 8,975 tanks, 17,895 armored fighting vehicles, 26,622 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,421 artillery systems, 1,231 multiple launch rocket systems, 978 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 17,009 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-670-190-troops-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-13T22:10:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/upd_GettyImages-2164069605.jpg
Lukashenko claims Russian nuclear realignment was long overdue	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, in a comment to a Russian reporter, said that recent changes to Russia&apos;s nuclear weapons policy were long overdue and would likely &apos;cool the ardor&apos; of Western nations. In a video published on Oct. 13, Lukashenko noted that &quot;hotheads&quot; in the West had already noticed nuclear signals from Moscow even before President Vladimir Putin announced the policy changes last month. On Sept. 25, Putin expanded the scenarios that could trigger a Russian nuclear response, including reliable intelligence of a large-scale cross-border attack involving aircraft, missiles, or drones. He also emphasized that any attack on Russia backed by a nuclear power would be treated as a joint assault. The Kremlin&#x2019;s move was a direct response to discussions in the U.S. and U.K. about allowing Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory with Western-supplied long-range conventional missiles. &quot;This doctrine should have been renewed long ago,&quot; Lukashenko remarked. Last year, he agreed with Putin to station Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. He warned that without Putin&#x2019;s earlier nuclear signals, &quot;Western missiles would already be bombing us, especially Russia.&quot; Ukraine has condemned Russia&apos;s nuclear posture as blackmail, with President Volodymyr Zelensky urging Western leaders to ignore Putin&apos;s &quot;red lines.&quot; Moscow insists that its warnings are genuine. Putin warned that if the U.S. and its allies approve Ukraine&#x2019;s use of long-range missiles, they will be directly engaging in the war against Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-claims-russian-nuclear-realignment-was-long-overdue/	2024-10-13T21:41:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2162854097.jpg
Orban threatens to interfere with Ukraine aid to support Trump, Politico reports	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is preparing to deliver a significant policy concession to former President Donald Trump, potentially allowing him to evade a $50 billion loan intended to support Ukraine amid its ongoing war with Russia. Should Trump win the presidency in November, this move would enable him to reassure Republican voters that he would not provide additional financial assistance to Ukraine, Politico reported on Oct. 14. Hungary has said it will not approve changes to rules permitting the U.S. to take a substantial role in the loan until after the U.S. election. The proposed loan relies on the profits from over $250 billion in Russian assets frozen in Western countries following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. While the U.S. insists that the European Union extend the sanctions renewal period from six months to a minimum of 36 months to facilitate this arrangement, Orban has opposed this extension. He alone can block the necessary changes since all 27 EU member states must agree to any modifications in sanctions rules. Ukraine urgently requires fresh funding to sustain its government and prepare for a harsh winter as Russia targets its energy infrastructure. Orban&apos;s stance significantly complicates the U.S. involvement, yet Europe appears prepared to move forward regardless. An EU diplomat who talked to Politico on conditions of anonymity said: &quot;If we don&#x2019;t work this out [by extending the sanctions duration], it will cost the EU &#x2014; including Hungary &#x2014; more money.&quot; &quot;They [Hungary] don&#x2019;t care if Europe has to pay more. It&#x2019;s about helping Trump,&quot; another EU diplomat said. If the loan proceeds without U.S. participation, Trump would not be obligated to service it if reelected, significantly benefiting him politically. As Orban threatened to use his veto power in Brussels, the U.S. signaled it might still participate in the loan, albeit for a reduced amount, of around $5 billion, equating to the Russian assets held domestically. If Hungary remains unyielding on the sanctions duration, the EU plans to finalize the loan independently, as its budget rules facilitate quicker approval before year-end.	https://kyivindependent.com/orban-threatens-to-interfere-with-ukraine-aid-to-support-trump-politico-reports/	2024-10-13T19:42:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1143562490.jpg
Nearly 37,000 residents evacuated from Sumy Oblast, additional efforts ongoing, military says	A total of nearly 37,000 residents have been evacuated from Sumy Oblast, including over 6,400 children, as efforts are ongoing to evacuate more residents under expanded mandatory evacuation orders, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration said on Oct. 13. Sumy Oblast, located on Ukraine&apos;s northeast border with Russia, is subject to daily attacks, and is situated just across from Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast - the region subject to Ukraine&apos;s ongoing incursion. In recent months, Russian troops have significantly increased the use of guided aerial bombs near the border areas of Sumy Oblast. Officials said in late August that are planning to evacuate a total of 45,000 residents from Sumy Oblast. Since then, an additional 16,000 people have been evacuated from the region, including 535 adults and 143 children in the past week. The evacuations continue after local authorities on Sept. 30 further ordered mandatory evacuation of children accompanied by their parents from an expanded area within the 10-kilometer zone bordering Russia. All residents within the 10-kilometer zone bordering Russia have already been evacuated entirely, the military administration noted. On Oct. 13, Russia attacked six communities in Sumy Oblast causing 21 explosions throughout the day, the military administration reported. Residents in the region have typically experience living through hundreds of explosions on a daily basis.	https://kyivindependent.com/nearly-37-000-people-evacuated-from-sumy-oblast-additional-efforts-ongoing-military-says/	2024-10-13T16:13:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1973286879.jpg
Kyiv considering ceding territory to end war with Russia, Der Spiegel reports	The Ukrainian government is considering options to end Russia&apos;s full-scale war that would involve temporarily suspending its goal of restoring Ukraine&apos;s full territorial integrity, the German news outlet Der Spiegel reported on Oct. 13, citing an official close to the Ukrainian government. Over 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territory is currently under Russian occupation. A pillar of President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s peace formula for Ukraine involves the full liberation of all occupied territories, and Kyiv has repeatedly said it is not willing to make territorial concessions to Moscow. The government is now holding &quot;serious discussions&quot; about relinquishing its aim of full territorial restoration, an unnamed official told Der Spiegel. &quot;We believed that victory had to mean the unconditional surrender of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&apos;s Russia,&quot; the source reportedly said. This was &quot;a mistaken view of victory,&quot; the source claimed, saying an agreement to end the war would be impossible without some concessions. Factors pushing Kyiv to consider territorial concessions include Russia&apos;s grinding advance in eastern Ukraine and the uncertain outcome of the U.S. presidential election, according to the official. &quot;Whether it&apos;s (former U.S. President Donald) Trump or (Vice President Kamala) Harris, the Americans will slowly but surely withdraw,&quot; the official told Der Spiegel. Trump has criticized U.S. aid to Ukraine, calling Zelensky a &quot;salesman&quot; and pledging to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the conflict if re-elected. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Trump ally, recently told the press he has no &quot;appetite for further Ukraine funding.&quot; Harris, by contrast, has taken sharp aim at proposals to end the war that involve Ukraine giving up large portions of its sovereign territory. &quot;These proposals are the same as those of Putin, and let us be clear, these are not proposals for peace,&quot; Harris said on Sept. 26. &quot;Instead, they are proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable.&quot; Russian troops partially control Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. Moscow claims to have annexed the entire territory of those regions despite not controlling two regional capitals &#x2014; Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. &#xA0;Russian forces also occupy Ukraine&apos;s Crimean peninsula. &#xA0; Polling from July of this year shows that 55% of Ukrainians oppose territorial concessions to Russia in exchange for peace. The number is lower than that recorded in previous surveys: Polls in February and December 2023 found that 65% and 74%, respectively, opposed such concessions. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Presidential Office, said on Sept. 17 that none of the plans Ukraine is developing to end Russia&apos;s war envisages a ceasefire or ceding territory to Moscow, despite some media reports.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-considering-ceding-territory-to-end-war-with-russia-der-spiegel-reports-2/	2024-10-13T13:22:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2162534022-1.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine is holding front line in Kursk Oblast despite Russian attacks, Zelensky says	Key developments on Oct. 13: Ukrainian troops are holding the front line in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast despite Russian attempts to break through, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 12. &quot;There were attempts by Russia to push back our positions. But we are holding the defined lines,&quot; he said. Zelensky posted the comments on his official Telegram channel after Russian military sources claimed the prior day to have recaptured nearly two dozen settlements in Kursk Oblast. &quot;Russian forces have likely advanced within at least 13 settlements in Kursk Oblast that Ukrainian forces had previously reportedly operated in as of Oct. 11,&quot; according to analysts at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, also commented on the issue on his Telegram channel on Oct. 12. &quot;Active fighting continues in Kursk Oblast,&quot; he said. &quot;After (Ukrainian troops) partially regained the positions where the Russians had entered, (Russian troops) began to send columns to attack again.&quot; Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in early August, allegedly seizing around 100 settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles). Russia began a counteroffensive in the region in September, with reportedly minimal success. Earlier in the week, U.S. officials assessed that Ukraine has the ability to hold territory in Kursk Oblast for months. Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin announced on Oct. 13 that his office had opened an investigation after Russian troops reportedly shot nine Ukrainian soldiers who surrendered as prisoners in Kursk Oblast. &quot;The killing of prisoners of war is a gross violation of the Geneva Conventions and an international crime. A criminal case has been opened over the violation of the laws and customs of war combined with premeditated murder,&quot; Kostin posted on X. &quot;We are doing our utmost to identify and prosecute all those responsible for the aggressor&apos;s crimes committed against Ukraine and Ukrainians.&quot; The shootings are said to have occurred on Oct. 10, the crowd-sourced monitoring group DeepState reported on Oct. 13, citing sources in Ukraine&apos;s First Tank Brigade. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiga posted on X on Oct 13, calling for the international community to take immediate action by issuing warrants for Russian executioners, increasing sanctions, and demanding access to detention sites. &quot;Russia&apos;s mistreatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war is absolute barbarism, grave violation of international humanitarian law, laws and customs of war. Executions are becoming more frequent, 95% of POWs are subjected to torture according to the UN, denied basic needs and access,&quot; he wrote. Ukraine&apos;s Obudsman Dmytro Lubinets said that he had submitted information about the execution cases in Kursk to the U.N. and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Summary executions by Russians of Ukrainian prisoners of war have sharply risen in the past year. Kyiv knows of 93 Ukrainian POWs who were summarily executed by Russian soldiers on the battlefield throughout the full-scale war, a senior representative of the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on national television on Oct. 4. Russian forces are using black-market Starlink internet terminals en masse on the front lines in Ukraine, contributing to territorial gains, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Oct. 12. Elon Musk&apos;s company SpaceX began providing Starlink terminals to Ukraine shortly after the full-scale invasion, giving Kyiv a crucial battlefield advantage. While SpaceX does not sell units to Russia directly, Russian troops in Ukraine continue to obtain Starlink terminals through shadowy supply chains and intermediaries. The proliferation of Starlink terminals among Russian front-line troops has contributed to Moscow&apos;s recent battlefield gains, including the occupation of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, the WP reports, citing several Ukrainian soldiers and military officers. &quot;They just overpowered us,&quot; an officer in the 72nd Mechanized Brigade, one of the units defending Vuhledar, told the WP. The officer said Russia&apos;s access to Starlink was a key factor in the loss of the city, along with weapons and personnel shortages. A drone platoon commander with the 93rd Mechanized Brigade said that while Ukraine&apos;s Starlink terminals previously gave them a technological edge over Russian forces, that advantage has now disappeared. &quot;Before, the Russians couldn&apos;t control some of their movements, maneuvers, artillery, infantry,&quot; he said. When Ukraine intercepted Russian radio transmissions, they observed soldiers frequently giving incomplete or wrong information to their commanders, the platoon commander said. That has now changed. &quot;Now they will only improve, and unfortunately, that&apos;s what&apos;s happening across the board,&quot; he said. Russia has used around 900 guided aerial bombs against Ukraine this week alone, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 13. Guided aerial bombs are precision-guided munitions that have a shorter range than missiles, but are far cheaper to produce. The weapons are launched from aircraft within Russian territory, outside the range of Ukrainian air defense. Russia also launched more than 40 missiles and 400 combat drones of various types, Zelensky said in a video address posted on Telegram. &quot;No nation should go through such trials alone. Our partners have the opportunity to provide the necessary quantity and quality of air defense systems, to make decisions about our sufficient range, and to ensure the timely delivery of defense assistance to our soldiers,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;We must not waste time - we must give the necessary signal of determination.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-is-holding-front-line-in-kursk-oblast-despite-russian-attacks-zelensky-says/	2024-10-13T11:48:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172545405.jpg
Zelensky warns of 'increasing alliance' between Russia, North Korea	Russia&apos;s deepening alliance with North Korea necessitates a strong response from Ukraine and its international partners, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Oct. 13. The president&apos;s remarks follow reports that North Korea is likely to deploy regular troops to Ukraine to aid Russia at the front. &quot;We see an increasing alliance between Russia and regimes like North Korea,&quot; Zelensky said in his address. &quot;This is no longer just about transferring weapons. It is actually about transferring people from North Korea to the occupying military forces.&quot; In light of this escalation, Ukraine&apos;s front-line troops need &quot;more support,&quot; Zelensky said, emphasizing that support for Kyiv extends beyond weapons deliveries. &quot;It is about increasing pressure on the aggressor, which will be stronger than they can withstand. And it is about preventing a bigger war,&quot; he said. Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened military cooperation as Russia seeks arms and other support in its full-scale war against Ukraine. North Korea has been supplying Russia with ballistic missiles and vast quantities of artillery shells. The two countries signed a mutual defense pact during Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s visit to Pyongyang earlier this year. South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-Hyun told lawmakers in early October that North Korea was likely planning to send troops to Ukraine to fight alongside Russia. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Oct. 10 dismissed these reports as &quot;fake news.&quot; Zelensky said on Oct. 13 that Kyiv will hold additional talks with Western partners in the coming days on Ukraine&apos;s victory plan. &quot;(I)t is absolutely realistic to strengthen the position of our country, to strengthen the position of Ukraine exactly as it is necessary for a fair peace,&quot; he said. &quot;And right now we need to act to prevent Russia and its allies from adapting to our capabilities.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-warns-of-increasing-alliance-between-russia-north-korea/	2024-10-13T11:04:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/zelensky-1.jpeg
Estonia considering buying defense equipment from Ukraine, official says	Estonia is considering the possibility of purchasing defense supplies from Ukraine, Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said on Oct. 13, according to local media. Ukraine&apos;s martial law prohibits the export of defense equipment, but Pevkur said it might be possible to circumvent these restrictions if both countries came to a mutually beneficial agreement. An agreement of this kind could help Ukraine increase defense production, Pevkur said, according to the Estonian media outlet ERR. &quot;If we receive consent from the Ukrainian government, then, of course, this can be done,&quot; Pevkur said. &quot;We need to understand here that this can only be done in such a way that if we buy, then Ukraine gets more money. And they will be able to produce more for their army.&quot; Kyiv has scaled up defense production over the past two years and aims to become a global leader in the defense sector. Ukraine now has the capacity to produce around $20 billion worth of weapons and equipment, according to government estimates, but the state budget can only fund around $6 billion. Pevkur said that if Tallinn and Kyiv reach a defense purchase agreement, Estonia will only buy equipment the country most urgently needs. &quot;Long-range missiles are, of course, interesting for us,&quot; the Estonian defense minister said. &quot;There are many different options. Of course, we cannot talk in detail, but first of all, we will look at these systems that can affect the enemy at a long range.&quot; Pevkur will meet with Defense Minister Rustem Umerov in Brussels next week, and also plans to visit Ukraine in the near future. Estonia and Ukraine signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement on June 26. The deal stipulates that Estonia will supply Ukraine with defense aid worth more than 100 million euro ($107 million) this year and will allocate at least 0.25% of its gross domestic product (GDP) annually for military support in 2024&#x2013;2027. Kyiv and Tallinn will also will launch a regular &quot;strategic dialogue&quot; and deepen their military-industrial cooperation.	https://kyivindependent.com/estonia-considering-buying-defense-equipment-from-ukraine-official-says/	2024-10-13T10:31:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/DSC02033.jpg
Russia's illegal use of Starlink terminals hastened fall of Vuhledar, WP reports	Russian forces are using black-market Starlink internet terminals en masse on the front lines in Ukraine, contributing to territorial gains, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Oct. 12. Elon Musk&apos;s company SpaceX began providing Starlink terminals to Ukraine shortly after the full-scale invasion, giving Kyiv a crucial battlefield advantage. While SpaceX does not sell units to Russia directly, Russian troops in Ukraine continue to obtain Starlink terminals through shadowy supply chains and intermediaries. The proliferation of Starlink terminals among Russian front-line troops has contributed to Moscow&apos;s recent battlefield gains, including the occupation of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast, the WP reports, citing several Ukrainian soldiers and military officers. &quot;They just overpowered us,&quot; an officer in the 72nd Mechanized Brigade, one of the units defending Vuhledar, told the WP. The officer said Russia&apos;s access to Starlink was a key factor in the loss of the city, along with weapons and personnel shortages. A drone platoon commander with the 93rd Mechanized Brigade said that while Ukraine&apos;s Starlink terminals previously gave them a technological edge over Russian forces, that advantage has now disappeared. &quot;Before, the Russians couldn&apos;t control some of their movements, maneuvers, artillery, infantry,&quot; he said. When Ukraine intercepted Russian radio transmissions, they observed soldiers frequently giving incomplete or wrong information to their commanders, the platoon commander said. That has now changed. &#xA0; &quot;Now they will only improve, and unfortunately, that&apos;s what&apos;s happening across the board,&quot; he said. Starlink allows for faster, more secure communications and has thus become indispensable to Ukraine&apos;s ability to communicate on the battlefield. Russia&apos;s previous reliance on radio communications set the otherwise larger, better-armed force at a disadvantage. The Pentagon, which financially supports Starlink access for the Ukrainian military, announced in May 2024 that it is working to prevent Russian troops from using the terminals in Ukraine. The U.S. has become &quot;heavily involved in working with the government of Ukraine and SpaceX to counter Russian illicit use of Starlink terminals,&quot; &#xA0;Defense Department Assistant Secretary for Space Policy John Plumb said on May 9. Despite these assurances, Starlink use has continued to expand across Russian lines this year, the WP reported. Ukrainian troops near the embattled front-line city of Pokrovsk said they began seeing Starlinks in Russian positions beginning last month. A battalion commander in the 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade said Russia&apos;s Starlink access helped them advance toward Pokrovsk and that more must be done to combat Russian use of the devices. &quot;It is something that kills us,&quot; he said. Disabling Russia&apos;s terminals has become difficult in part due to shifting front lines, Stacie Pettyjohn, defense program director for the Center for a New American Security, told the WP. &quot;Ukrainian forces are in Russia now. Where exactly are the front lines?&quot; she said. &quot;If there&apos;s a line drawn as to where it works and where it doesn&apos;t, you&#x2019;re basically fixing the front lines where they are and preventing the Ukrainians from going on the offensive.&quot; Disruptions to Ukrainian troops&apos; Starlink access have occurred before, particularly during Russia&apos;s spring offensive against Kharkiv Oblast and when Ukrainian forces launched their incursion into Kursk Oblast in August. Musk has denied selling any Starlink units to Russia and said that Starlink would not connect to any devices there. Russian soldiers nonetheless continue to obtain devices through a robust black market supply chain. According to the WP&apos;s analysis of some Russian sites selling military supplies, the Starlink terminals are most often sold via Telegram and travel to the front via Moscow. The majority of terminals come from Europe and are transported through the United Arab Emirates, with warnings not to activate the device in Russia. &#xA0; To activate the terminal, users require a foreign phone number, email address, and bank account. Tymofii, a drone pilot with the 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade, said Russian forces appeared to have no shortage of Starlink terminals. &quot;They have a lot of them. &#x2026; They use them the same way we do,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-illegal-use-of-starlink-terminals-hastened-fall-of-vuhledar-wp-reports/	2024-10-13T09:44:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1259126916.jpeg
Defense minister confirms more weapons pledges, arms production after foreign visit	A meeting with Western defense partners yielded &quot;concrete results&quot; for Ukraine, &#xA0;Defense Minister Rustem Umerov reported on Oct. 13. Umerov visited counterparts from France, the U.K., Italy, and Germany as part of a delegation headed by President Volodymyr Zelensky. &quot;(A)ll four countries confirmed that investments in Ukraine&apos;s industrial-defense complex will grow,&quot; Umerov said via Telegram. The U.K. pledged to provide additional long-range weapons, artillery systems, and &#xA0;robotic systems, while French President Emmanuel Macron discussed the possibility of opening a training center for drone operators in France, according to the announcement. Frozen Russian assets will be used to finance Ukraine&apos;s defense needs, Umerov said. &quot;We discussed specific steps to increase the production of weapons &#x2014; both in Ukraine and through the creation of joint ventures with our European partners,&quot; Umerov said. &quot;This will make it possible to manufacture equipment, weapons and ammunition for the Defense Forces within a fundamentally new format of cooperation.&quot; Kyiv now aims to become a global leader in the defense sector, but with its economy drained by the war, it needs foreign investment and partnerships to accomplish this goal. Ukraine has the capacity to produce around $20 billion worth of weapons and equipment, according to government estimates, but the state budget can only fund around $6 billion. Foreign companies are increasingly making deals to jointly produce weaponry in Ukraine, including 155 shells, loitering munitions, and specialty chemicals. &#xA0; Earlier this month, Zelensky highlighted that Ukraine has exponentially increased domestic ammunition production over the past two years and has successfully tested its own ballistic missile. &quot;In the first half of this year alone, Ukraine produced 25 times more artillery and mortar ammunition than in the entire year of 2022,&quot; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-defense-minister-confirms-more-defense-production-cooperation-and-weapons-pledges-after-foreign-visit/	2024-10-13T08:19:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168760161.jpg
Media: Biden to visit Germany on Oct. 18	U.S. President Joe Biden will visit Germany on Oct. 18 after an earlier trip was postponed due to Hurricane Milton in the Gulf of Mexico, according to media reports published on Oct. 13. Biden will meet with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Chancellor Olaf Scholz during his visit, according to the German publication Der Spiegel. They are expected to discuss the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Biden was supposed to convene a leader-level meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Germany on Oct. 12, where President Volodymyr Zelensky was expected to present his victory plan. However, he put off his visit in order to oversee the emergency response to Hurricane Milton. The Germany trip, originally planned as a formal state visit with a banquet and formal events before a new U.S. president is elected in November, has now been pared down to primarily work events, according to Der Spiegel.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-biden-to-visit-germany-on-oct-18/	2024-10-13T08:09:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175587602.jpg

Zelensky: Russia has used around 900 aerial bombs against Ukraine this week	Russia has used around 900 guided aerial bombs against Ukraine this week alone, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 13. Guided aerial bombs are precision-guided munitions that have a shorter range than missiles, but are far cheaper to produce. The weapons are launched from aircraft within Russian territory, outside the range of Ukrainian air defense. Russia also launched more than 40 missiles and 400 combat drones of various types, Zelensky said in a video address posted on Telegram. &quot;No nation should go through such trials alone. Our partners have the opportunity to provide the necessary quantity and quality of air defense systems, to make decisions about our sufficient range, and to ensure the timely delivery of defense assistance to our soldiers,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;We must not waste time - we must give the necessary signal of determination.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-russia-has-used-around-900-guided-aerial-bombs-against-ukraine-this-week/	2024-10-13T06:59:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168195934.jpg
Prosecutors open investigation into alleged killing of 9 POWs by Russians in Kursk Oblast	Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin announced on Oct. 13 that his office had opened an investigation after Russian troops reportedly shot nine Ukrainian soldiers who surrendered as prisoners in Kursk Oblast. &quot;The killing of prisoners of war is a gross violation of the Geneva Conventions and an international crime. A criminal case has been opened over the violation of the laws and customs of war combined with premeditated murder,&quot; Kostin posted on X. &quot;We are doing our utmost to identify and prosecute all those responsible for the aggressor&apos;s crimes committed against Ukraine and Ukrainians.&quot; The shootings are said to have occurred on Oct. 10, the crowd-sourced monitoring group Deepstate reported on Oct. 13, citing sources in Ukraine&apos;s First Tank Brigade. Ukraine&apos;s Obudsman Dmytro Lubinets said that he had submitted information about these cases to the U.N. and the International Committee of the Red Cross. &#xA0; Summary executions by Russians of Ukrainian prisoners of war have sharply risen in the past year. Kyiv knows of 93 Ukrainian POWs who were summarily executed by Russian soldiers on the battlefield throughout the full-scale war, a senior representative of the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on national television on Oct. 4.	https://kyivindependent.com/prosecutor-generals-office-is-investigating-alleged-killing-of-9-pows-by-russians/	2024-10-13T05:30:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/kostin.jpeg
Ukraine is holding front line in Kursk Oblast despite Russian attacks, Zelensky says	Ukrainian troops are holding the front line in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast despite Russian attempts to break through, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 12. &quot;There were attempts by Russia to push back our positions. But we are holding the defined lines,&quot; he said. Zelensky posted the comments on his official Telegram channel after Russian military sources claimed the prior day to have recaptured nearly two dozen settlements in Kursk Oblast. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), &quot;ISW assesses that Russian forces have likely advanced within at least 13 settlements in Kursk Oblast that Ukrainian forces had previously reportedly operated in as of Oct. 11.&quot; Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, also commented on the issue on his Telegram channel on Oct. 12. &quot;Active fighting continues in Kursk Oblast,&quot; he said. &quot;After (Ukrainian troops) partially regained the positions where the Russians had entered, (Russian troops) began to send columns to attack again.&quot; Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in early August, allegedly seizing around 100 settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles). Russia began a counteroffensive in the region in September, with reportedly minimal success. Earlier in the week, U.S. officials assessed that Ukraine has the ability to hold territory in Kursk Oblast for months.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-is-holding-defined-lines-despite-russians-pushing-back-in-kursk-zelensky-says/	2024-10-13T04:11:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2176416230.jpg
Russian troops reportedly shoot 9 Ukrainian POWs in Kursk Oblast	Nine Ukrainian soldiers who surrendered as prisoners were allegedly shot by Russian troops in Kursk Oblast earlier this week, the crowd-sourced monitoring site Deepstate reported on Oct. 13. The shootings are said to have occurred on Oct. 10, Deepstate reported, citing sources in Ukraine&apos;s First Tank Brigade. &quot;Information about the possible shooting by the Russians of nine Ukrainian prisoners of war in Kursk Oblast is again spreading in social networks,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said in a statement on Telegram. &quot;Such actions are a gross violation of the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War.&quot; Summary executions by Russians of Ukrainian prisoners of war have sharply risen in the past year. Kyiv knows of 93 Ukrainian POWs who were summarily executed by Russian soldiers on the battlefield throughout the full-scale war, a senior representative of the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on national television on Oct. 4. According to the prosecutors, 80% of those were recorded in 2024. &quot;Since November 2023, the approach of the Russian military toward our prisoners has significantly changed for the worse,&quot; Yurii Belousov, the head of the department focused on war-related crimes, said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-reportedly-shoot-9-surrendering-ukrainian-soldiers-in-kursk-region/	2024-10-13T03:04:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Mash-1.jpg
Russian fighter jets likely left Belarus, monitoring group says	Two Russian MiG-31K jets that were transferred to Belarus this week have most likely returned to Russia, the Belarusian monitoring group Hajun reported on Oct. 12. &quot;Based on the available information, we know that after takeoff the MiG-31Ks did not return to the Machulyshchi airfield. The fighters took a course to the south, flew past Baranovichi and then to the east &#x2014; towards the Russian Federation,&quot; the group posted on Telegram. &#xA0; &quot;Thus, at the moment, it is most likely that the MiGs left the territory of Belarus after takeoff and returned to Russia,&quot; the group added. The two MiG-31K jets landed in Belarus on Oct. 9 and 10, a year and a half after their last appearance in Belarus. Their sudden appearance at the airfield prompted speculation from Ukrainian officials and military experts that Russia may have moved the jets to Belarus to evade Ukrainian strikes, or to prepare for another massive attack. The jets can fly at speeds of up to 3,000 kilometers per hour and launch Kinzhal missiles with a range of 2,000 kilometers, putting all of Ukraine at risk. At the start of the full-scale invasion, Russia reportedly had 12 MiG-31s in service. However, Ukrainian drone strikes on Russia&#x2019;s Savasleyka airbase on Aug. 16 destroyed at least one MiG-31 and possibly damaged another, a military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-fighter-jets-leave-belarus-says-monitoring-group/	2024-10-13T01:33:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1240502848.jpg

Air Force: Ukraine downs 31 drones overnight	Ukraine shot down 31 of 68 combat drones Russia launched overnight on Oct. 13, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force said in its morning update. Anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare units, and mobile fire units were engaged in repelling the aerial assault. The drones were downed over Kyiv, Poltava, Chernihiv, Sumy and Cherkasy oblasts. Russia also attacked Ukraine with two Iskander-M ballistic missiles and two Kh-59 cruise missiles, the Air Force said. The missiles targeted Chernihiv, Sumy, Poltava, and Odesa oblasts. Drone attacks are a daily occurrence in Ukraine, affecting various regions across the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/air-force-ukraine-downs-31-drones-overnight/	2024-10-13T00:26:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2147853376-3.jpg
Mediazona confirms identities of nearly 73,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine	Through open-source research, Mediazona, a Russian independent media outlet, together with BBC Russia, confirmed the names of 72,899 Russian soldiers who had been killed since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Since Mediazona&apos;s last update in late-September, the names of 1,842 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties. The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, regional media reports, and statements from local authorities. According to the journalist, Russian soldiers killed in action in 2024 tend to be increasingly older in age as the average age for volunteer recruits continues to soar. The plurality of volunteer recruits killed in the war fall most prominently between the ages of 48 and 50 years old. Since Russia began its all-out war against Ukraine over 4,100 officers have been killed in combat in Ukraine. The analysts also note that at least 13,438 Russian inmates have been killed on Ukraine&apos;s eastern front. According to Mediazona&apos;s estimates, a majority of those killed in action come from Rostov, Sverdlovsk, Bashkiria, and Chelyabinsk oblasts, as well as the Buryatia republic. A surge of recruitment by the Kremlin in the predominantly Muslim regions of Bashkortostan and Tatarstan have also showed an increase in those killed in action in recent months. The last few month, amid the renewed Kharkiv offensive as well as Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Kursk Oblast, Russian forces have experienced some of its heaviest losses since the start of the full-scale war. On July 5, Russian media outlets Meduza and Mediazona published an estimated report indicating that approximately 120,000 Russian troops have been killed since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine - although that number is likely significantly higher in the months since the report&apos;s release. As of August 12, 2024, the Ukrainian military estimates Russian combat losses at 667,630 troops - which likely includes Russian military personnel that have been killed, injured, captured, and missing in action.	https://kyivindependent.com/mediazona-confirms-identities-of-nearly-73-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine/	2024-10-12T17:54:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/kch-0854-1663443200tnjak.jpg
Zelensky to publicly unveil 'victory plan' in coming days, Podolyak says	President Volodymyr Zelensky will publicly unveil his &quot;victory plan&quot; to Ukrainians in &quot;a matter of days,&quot; Presidential Office advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said on Oct. 12. Zelensky&apos;s five-point victory plan includes military and diplomatic components, including Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO, but the full details of the peace framework have not yet been publicized. The goal of the plan is to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s future negotiating position and push Russia to make a just peace, Kyiv has said. Zelensky has already presented, to mixed results, the victory plan to a number of Western leaders including U.S. President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, among others. &quot;The key points are already clear, but (Zelensky) will add details that will clearly state what kind of programme of pressure it is, why it is important, and why it is parallel (to the peace formula), Podolyak said on the country&apos;s marathon TV broadcast, Ukrainska Pravda reported. Andriy Yermak, head of the Presidential Office, said on Sept. 29 that the plan will be presented to Ukrainians without some &quot;sensitive&quot; details to prevent information from leaking to Russia. &quot;Everything that becomes public is heard not only in our country, but also by the enemy. That is why some details of this plan are classified. But it is important to see the implementation of this plan on enemy territory,&quot; Yermak said. Zelensky has said that the plan is designed to push Russian President Vladimir Putin into a fair peace agreement by boosting Ukraine&#x2019;s firepower, including by requesting more weapons and lifting restrictions on long-range missile strikes - giving it an upper hand two and a half years into Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. &quot;It is important to understand what we are going to do at each stage of the war. I think the president will deliver the presentation quite effectively,&quot; Podolyak concluded.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-publicly-unveil-victory-plan-in-coming-days-podolyak-says/	2024-10-12T16:10:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173586535.jpg
